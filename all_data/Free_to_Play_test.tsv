0	1	a	APB Reloaded is an interesting type of creature. On one hand it is a brilliant way to spend time with your mates and have a laugh, and on the other hand it is annoying beyond belief.  APB Reloaded is Cops vs Criminals taken to a much larger scale. 100 people (50 Enforcers vs 50 Criminals) are in one instance of part of a city. By no means is it as large as Grand Theft Auto's expansive worlds. The city isn't too convincing either, as the AI is nothing to be proud of. The driving AI is horrendous, like, horrendous. If their path is blocked by a car in the middle of the road, one would assume that they would pass it. No. They stay there, waiting. This leads to queues of AI Cars. The AI out of the car is not too pleasing either.  The cars in this game handle as if they are on ice. Many of the cars slip and slide across the road with little control. This can prove a challenge to overcome at first.  The starting guns in APB Reloaded, the 'STAR 556' and 'Obeya FBW' are good enough for those who are starting up in APB Reloaded. However, the others guns within the game are more powerful that the starting weapons, so this proves an unfair advantage against the beginner.  The game works around a system of in-game purchases. After completing a mission you are given Cash. Cash can be used to rent guns, buy outfits, buy cars, customise the look of your character/cars and so on. The cost of a relatively good weapon is around 5-8 mission's worth of Cash. Missions tend to take from 10 minutes up to 20 minutes. So around 2 hours work will get you a new gun for one week. After the week expires, the gun is removed from your inventory. If you wish to buy a permanent gun you have to get one through the Armas Marketplace. G1C, otherwise known GamerFirst Credits must be bought through real life money. The guns that can be bought through the Marketplace are high end and pack a definite punch. Some guns on the Marketplace can be trialled for one hour to give you a taster before purchase. The system works well, when it isn't against you.  The matchmaking system in APB Reloaded is dependant upon your Threat Level. Depending on your ability, you will be graded from bad to good, Green, Bronze, Silver, Gold. You may be teamed up with a Bronze fighting a Silver, or a Silver against a Gold. It sounds as if it could not go wrong. But unfortunately, the system does not factor in what guns the user is currently using at the time. Two Bronzes might have bought weapons from the Armas Marketplace and a Silver is using the stock weapons. It doesn't work.  Another major flaw with this game is the amount of hackers that are within the game. Since the game is using the PunkBuster Online Countermeasures, the game tends to contain a fair amount of hackers. This ruins the experience for a new player, and possibly puts them off APB Reloaded.  Overall, APB Reloaded is a mixed bag of fun and straight up annoyance. Just make sure that you play with mates, or else this will prove to be more of a chore to play than fun.

12	1	a	*** APB COMMUNITY *** Very long review, but if you have the time, read it. Some play this game for the design factor, social status and overall attention, to play while disregarding the Terms and Conditions, alot play to troll other players, many play for skill and respect from others in the community, some just play for fun in their free time, others may play none stop to accomplish a personal goal of theirs. I personally have been playing this game for many years, for countless hours, I've always been for skill based playing and personal goals rather than grasping for a dead communities attention. This game has more cons then pros, cons being such as cheaters, or people trolling constantly, bugs, ddosing, server failures, and technichal difficulites this game has always had since start, bad gms and a very debatable slacking company, constantly biting off more then they can chew. The pros of this game are very simple, it has potential, and the way to make players keep coming back even after they've completely lost hope in enjoying the game again. Over the years this game has improved adding many patches and more recently FairFight. A system to remove (ban) players accounts once found hard evidence of using methods against the Terms and Conditions. Although in the past years, cheaters most definitely made many quit the game because of unfair gaming, FairFight has given APB:R a small amount of hope again for a game that has no cheaters. Which will in definitely never happen, all games of all generes have cheaters, so for a free to play game to never have cheaters is very unrealistic and this community needs to realize that. To add to players wanting social status and attention, many players of this game want to feel wanted by people of a dead community, that most likely will never interact with in real life. This game is full of emotinal dissasters with real life problems that take it out on the game and players. Such as having a large ego, or constantly begging for attention in awful ways sometimes hurting themselfs even more. In recent events, some go over the top and ban themselfs on purpose to get comments and likes on the FFBan list creating some type of 'social status' and it screams attention ♥♥♥♥♥, FairFights list of cheaters they have caught and banned. Some simply get banned to not feel the need to play this game anymore. If you're emotionally unstable person, I personally would say don't play this game in general because over time you will be affected one way or another. This game is very easy to troll and make other players in the community rage, my advice is to play patentiantly and calmly and know when to quit because after all, it is just a game. Raging and playing APB:R is a setup for failure, resulting in even worse emotional state. Don't take anything serious and just have fun. If you're grinding towards personal goals, such as maxing out a weapon role, maxing out your characters level, or even grinding money for a legendary you really want. It will come over time, not over night. To the people who are maxing a weapon role, set short term goals, example, 100 pointman kills aday, adding up over time. Don't force yourself to play more then you should. Don't just quit grinding simply because of a player cheating, or someone better then you is constantly killing you, or even if someone is trolling you, DON'T QUIT. I'f you're in for the long run, time flys, you'll regret not grinding towards something greater, I know I have. In ending discussion, I recommend this game over all the cons. This game is unique and like no other, with plently of potential and a ton of things to grind towards in-game. You dont have to buy anything and can still grind and get everything they put out in-game. I will never quit liking this game, and will never regret playing this game. So to you user, try this game out, maybe you'll enjoy, maybe you won't. You'll never know until you try it.
14	1	a	This game can be frustrating on your own So bring a friend with you! - I have found out that the game is so much fun when you're messing about with friends, More intense action &amp; funny moments to share with others   Although this game has some ups and downs, It's still enjoyable.  One thing i personally like about APB:Reloaded is the fact that you will be able to tell who your friends are in-game just by looking at what they're wearing since everyone can be unique &amp; create their own style.  This game is not pay to win,  I've been destroyed by default weapons being held by low level players. Most weapons on the armas marketplace are re-meshes of default weapons in-game and even with the unique weapons... You will still get your ♥♥♥ handed to you by stock weaponry.  You may not want to play because most these reviews are negative but do what i did - give it a go, I made so many new friends i would not have today &amp; this has turned into my most played &amp; loved game.    This review is a mess, I know.   Just have ago, Maybe you will like it - Maybe you wont. Only one way to find out... :)
16	1	a	APB is a fun game (most of the time).   Pros:  -Amazing character customization, the best I have seen in any game. -Very good song customization (if you are musical talanted, of course). -Many cars and weapons to choose between. -100 people districts. -Fight clubs for constant action.  Cons:  -The driving is HORRIBLE. It's like driving in mud, turn two seconds before you want to turn and you will be fine.. well done there G1. -Sh*t load of hackers and triggerbotters. (Less since fairfight) -Pay-to-get worthy things but not necessarily pay to win because most armas guns are reskins. -Bad graphics. -Bad optimization. -Matchmaking is complete sh*t. -Small development team and a very greedy one. -No new content since I started to play the game (2012). -Not very solo friendly. -Not really a way to make big profits other than being a talented designer or spending hours of ram raiding. -Silvers must play with golds because of the ridiculously low population. -Combat is kind of sh*tty, hit the head or the legs, same damage. -Not really any new content announced for the future.  But overall I do love this game. Of course I wish it were better in so many ways. APB has so much potential but the developer are to blind and greedy to see and/or give a f*ck about it. Regardless of what I think, if you have a lot of spare time and patience to commit to something new, give this game a try. You will not regret it (most of the time). You easily get addicted to this game.
18	1	a	For being free its cool. I like the customization and the vehicles. The community is rude and the game is p2w.  Proceed with caution
20	1	a	This game is in trouble. I am afraid that it needs a new owner. It is stagnating. This is the type of game that relys on it's player base. Meaning that as numbers dwindle the problems are compounded. There is so much more that could be done with this system. We were promised an entirely new engine. Where is it? There seems to be no motivation with the executive powers to innovate and implement things people have been begging for. The districts only handle fifty players per faction. That may sound like a lot to some people but it isn't. This leads to all the complaints of the matchmaking system. There simply is not a large enough pool of players to choose from. If everyone were grouped up that means there would be about twelve groups of opposition that it could choose to pit you against. Chances are if they are grouped in the first place they have a decent amount of skill and threat if not extremely over-powering. I am afraid that G1 will wait too long to address the key issues and it will goto another publisher in shambles. Just like everyone else has said, there is amazing potential, but it is just being squandered. So many of us have fallen in love with this game only to become broken hearted and bitter over it. So much money piddled away on it. $$$$$$$$
22	1	a	  Ok so this review will be based on my 2.5 year experience with APB.   Basically it's a cops vs criminals open world game where 2 sides are facing each other during missions (you basically ready up while beind in the 'out of mission mode' and you are being put in a mission with other random teammates or your premade group against some people from the opposite faction). You have a really wide selection of weapons and vehicles. You can even apply modifications to your character, weapons and vehicles. The game itself is great and the gameplay is really enjoyable after you become decent at the game. It contains lots of customization, you can change your character's appearance, you can create symbols and put them or your clothes or even on your body as tattoos, you can also design cars and get weapon skins, you can even compose your own songs and create death themes (people hear them when you kill them ;)). So basically you can customize to your heart's content. Overall one of the best games I've played so far and I will even risk saying that if APB was managed properly it could be as famous as CS:GO.   But then as a decent player let me tell you about the dark side of this game because I think that's what matters the most. The game is managed by a terrible company who is focusing only on getting sales on the in-game ARMAS Marketplace (yes you need to pay real money) the company promised us many many great features like improved match making or chat filtering or even the upgrade of a really outdated game engine. Years have passed and nothing has been done but yet new items on the marketplace such as clothing packs and usually overpowered broken weapons (which are of course being nerfed after the sales are dropping) are still appearing. Another really sad thing about this game is cheating. Yes the company added an anti-cheat called FairFight which was used in some other games as well and it was kind of working at the beginning but now the cheaters are going wild again. Some people still doubt if this anti-cheat really got implemented because of how poorly it works. This is a really competitive game so you need to spend years in it to be able to take down the top players and most of it depends on your dedication, skill and of course your gear, just like it is in CS:GO. While in CS:GO all that matters is your accuracy, ability to control the weapon and good awareness in APB accuracy and staying on the target at all times matters the most, there's no such thing as headshots or anything (one big hitbox) and people have more health than in CS:GO. People move really fast, they dodge to the sides, they camp the corners (you just need to overcome their chaotic movement and stay on the target). Back to the topic because the cheating is really really bad right now people tend to hackusate each other and that especially happens when you are a decent player (you will be getting tons of hackusations, you will be called names but it's kind of a good thing if that happens because you will know that you are improving and even though you are a legit player, other people are considering you a cheater) another bad part about cheating is that the game is free so even though someone gets banned, that person can just create a new account and keep playing. The game is basically full of toxic people, internet gangsters and kids but there are some nice people too. So now I should summarize. Really one of the best games I ever played, really solid mechanics, lots of customization and a really enjoyable gameplay (the con is that you need to spend an insane amount of time in it to become decent and be able to play on a decent level, most new players usually leave when they are getting stomped by old players but hey there are districts for players with lower skill level too, but even there you can encounter some smurfs from time to time), the game is owned by a really greedy company that very very very rarely keeps it's promises and mainly focuses on getting more money. The last thing is a toxic unforgiving community which will ruin your mood within minutes if not seconds but if you are up to the task and you are not afraid to accept the challenge and sign the pact then its definitely a game for you ! ;) If you will dedicate lots of time to it and you will keep playing for months or years you will become decent at it and salty people won't be scary anymore ;)  Pros:  +Great mechanics +Really enjoyable gameplay +Lots of customization +Big variety of weapons and vehicles +Big maps (districts) +Variety of missions  Cons:  -As a new player you will need to dedicate months if not years to become somewhat decent  -Game managed by a bad company -Toxic community -Cheaters -Unoptimized old engine (you will need a very decent CPU to avoid stuttering because APB doesn't use your GPU) -♥♥♥♥♥♥ lagging servers (sometimes)
24	1	a	 Here you go, a wall of text and the only reason, I am doing this, is the stupid community badge...   I think it's kinda funny to read all these negative reviews, coming from people with over 1000 hours on this game. I mean, seriously, all those terrible things they are talking about, which makes the game unplayable for them, have been there forever. But for some inexplicable reason, they kept playing this f***ing game for so long. Weird, huh? Maybe this game isn't that bad at all.  So, instead of wasting time reading reviews telling more about the people writing them, than the game itself, you could just download and try it. It's F2P, so the worst thing that can happen, is you wasting 2 hours of your life. Just a warning though, if you think you will rock this game, because you've played CS for 5 years, well it's not gonna happen. It takes months if not years to become a decent player.   So, after dying a lot and losing most of the missions you will probably rage quit after a week. It's ok though, nothing wrong with that, but please don't become one of these frustrated folks, who quit and make poor excuses (cheaters, P2W, lags), instead of admitting, that they really suck at this game, because that's just pathetic.    Community:   APB has a 'toxic' community, bla, bla... I read this a lot. It means, that all these amazing, nice and friendly people suddenly turn into complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s after playing this game for a while (which is complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t btw.). But, if you are reading this and think, that's what happened to you, let me be clear on this: 'Dude, you were already an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ before you even touched this game'.   You can't expect Eve Online community here. APB is a shooter, so yeah, you get the idea. But it's not as bad as some people say it is. The good thing is, if you are some stupid ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ with anger issues, you don't have to worry about the community at all, because you will fit right in and you will make ton of friends really quick. There are even whole clans for people just like you. And if you are one of the good guys, you don't have to worry neither. It may take a little longer, but you will make a lot of friends, too.   Oh, and let's talk about insults, because it's a big part of the game, like raging and hating this game (everyone will hate this game at some point). Sooner or later people will start hackusating and insulting you with the most insulting things you can imagine. But don't worry or be mad, because it's actually a good thing. It's a sign of recognition. What these poor creatures are trying to say is, that they really admire your skill, they hate losing against you and they wish they were half as good as you are, but fail horribly in doing so, no matter how hard they try.   P2W/Cheaters:    It's not P2W and it's not full of cheaters.   Most of the weapons you can buy for cash are the same weapons, with identical stats you can get for ingame money. They only look different, have different firing sound and different mods. That's all. But, you can't just beat a guy, who is better than you, because you spend x bucks on this game. He will compliment your new shiny weapon, kill you with a starter pistol and start laughing.  And all these people complaining about cheaters... You would think 50% of all players are cheating. In reality it's less than 1% and most of the hackusations are either coming from people, who just started playing or from people who really suck at this game. Just watch the district chat and look who these people actually are, who are complaining there.    Some advise for new players:       Relax, seriously, it's just a freaking game, if you are angry or in a bad mood, you shouldn't be playing at all, nothing good will come out of this     Find someone nice, you can group up with, someone who can teach you a few things about the game and who doesn't care to much about winning and losing.     Don't call other people cheaters, because it's almost impossible to see the difference if you just started playing and the skill difference between a new player and someone who played for a few months may be huge.     If you are playing against a cheater, just ignore him, go afk for 5 min, grab a drink and wait till the mission is over. It's funny how people always go after a cheater, like they were trying to prove something, end up getting killed 10 times and then start raging.

30	1	a	The game is pretty darn fun and after putting a good amount of hours into it, unlocking the basic array of vanilla weapons. You end up getting used to incidents like this.  1. Gold threat group leader tells me to GTFO cause I'm a silver threat. 2. Took out entire team about to finish their objective 3. Get called hacker. 4. Stun One member of other team by Kamikazi-Stun-Greading 5. Got 'reported' by stunned person. 6. Destroyed ugly urban-camo player owned van. 7.1. Gold threat group leader still tells me to GTFO cause I'm a silver threat. 7.2. Group leader dies WHILE TYPING THAT. 8. Mission won, still told to GTFO by group leader. 9. Called hacker in district chat by raging gold threat of other team.  Such fun when you're good at clicking on a moving target, and they just can't accept losing. :D 
32	1	a	This game is Awesome!  No more car handling problem. 9/10
34	1	a	OK. Let me get something out of the way. I took a quick look trough reviews of people who have played no more than 100 hours or so. That isnt really much...Even I with 1,2k hour feel that its low. The game isnt PTW. You need to play a while to unlock the good stuff. There are maybe 2-3 weapons in total that you cant get in the game, but only from the store, but they arent really good so yea...You can unlock the good gear just by playing a while with the type of weapon. 95% of the guns in the store are reskins! Game servers could be worse, but also can be improved a lot. Hacking isn't a problem anymore because APB actually has a working anti-cheat now. Community is pretty much awfull-1 out of 3 players is an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who will do nothing but 'troll' you.  There are people who have been playing for countless hours and will pretty much destroy you the second you go up against them...but there are people who literally dont know what to do so yea...you have that... I played during the whole hack fest, during the server lag fest and pretty much everything worth noting about the game. Reloaded started actually doing something around 4-5 months ago. Servers are better, hackers are gone, scammers are pretty much gone etc. (That doesnt mean you should trust anyone that is.Follow the rule of apb:TRUST NOBODY)  If you have some spare time on your hands and have nerves of steel you should definately try the game...Sadly once you start playing you never stop. Trust me ive tried more than once.
36	1	a	killed SMGs with sniper from 1m away, never gonna play anything else
38	1	a	Lag: ✔ Toxic community: ✔ Ruining my life: ✔ Gives AIDS? ✔ How about chlamydia? ✔ Can't stop playing and getting cancer? ✔ 5/7
40	1	a	All Points bulletin: Reloaded was a game created by Realtime Worlds until they went under in 2010, and bought by Gamersfirst in 2011. It has very many pros, yet cons that are very hard to look over. Let's review some of the bigger ones.  Pros: 1 Very user friendly, doesnt try and complicate things more than it should. Shoot bad guys, do objectives, make money. 2 INCREDIBLE amount of customization, it never stops amazing me the boundless amounts of effort you can put into the customization system, and the spectacular things these people create. 3 It's very addictive. Once you start getting involved in this game, you really dont want to stop, it is a very rewarding game, saving up for that seventy thousand dollar car, then running over people without a care in it, is one of the many things that let you work hard, and feel good about it.  4 The story is so well thought out. The universe of San Paro is a deep one, that you can spend hours reading along all the things the characters have to say to you, or all the lore about the city, and it's workings. No part of the story feels silly, or pointless. It's all very real in a sense. 5 The way it pits you against players is very fine tuned, and well thought out. Seamlessly going from open world cruising to intense battles, and being able to see other players taking part in their own little missions. 6 The banning system. You get banned if you break the code of conduct, and then it broadcasts to the entire game, to every single server, district, and player, that you've been banned, your name, and the server you play on. It's very nice seeing the occasional cheater get booted.  Now, the Cons of APB!  1 The playerbase is a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. If you're not dealing with beatneck weaboos who wear cat ears, say 'Rawr', and think they're the most Kawaii desu Planet earth has to offer, you're dealing with shartbucket tryhards who are treating this free to play game like it's their new religion. 1.5 Furries. There are so many furries who play apb (Furries generally crowd around f2p's, most being poor and all) so if you don't like them, you'll get real upset, real fast. Usually, I don't mind furries at all, matter of fact, I like a good few. But the kind that I find in apb are usually 100% xenophobic transexual crazies who want to share their fetishes with the rest of the playerbase. And that gets old. You know who you are. 2 It's very easy to be messed with. Either your teamates wont stop slaughtering you, or a bypasser driving a dump truck decides to push you up against a wall and blow you up. Making another player's day hell, even if they arent a part of your mission, is so, so easy. 3 The combat can feel ♥♥♥♥ed. There's no fatigue system, so after someone sprints up to you with a fifty cal, gets a perfect shot on you three times, then sprints away, you start to see why stamina not effecting your aim is total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥st Alot of the weapons, SMGS mostly, fire fast, do insane damage, and make all other guns humbled, while shotguns are unsatisfying and hard to master. 4 There are no servers for people who speak other languages, you get tired of being put up with a bunch of latino gamers who dont speak a lick of basic english. 5 The friend system is a bit odd, you dont send request, moreso you add someone to your list, then you can invite them to groups, whisper to them, and all that. But they cant do it to you, unless they add you to Their list. It's just odd. 6 You'll start to run into the same clans, over and over again, and they wont get any less annoying, doesnt matter what faction, each has a few big ones that are downright irritating. For the Enforcers its WASP and HORNET, for the crims it's The Kriminal Kitty Kult, and Common Sense.   But overall? Do I like this game? Hell yes. Do I wish it were better in some aspects? HELL YES. Regardless of what I think, if you have the time, and patience to commit to something new, get it. You will not regret your desicion. (Most of the time)
42	1	a	Play it, folks. We're working hard to make it better and better.
44	1	a	The Best Game EVER!  1) It's game not P2W, because all weapons are balanced. Armas weapons are aviable in joker shop and in-game shop (from contacts), almost armas guns are reskins (For example VAS=N-TEC) 2) It's game ONLY for skilled shooter games players 3) Very extensive customization, any player are unique 4) Cheaters will be banned (game is running with FairFight) 5) In last time game became more optimized, and will be more optimized  &lt;3 APB :D :D
46	1	a	 I've played this game for a somewhat long time now, so I thought 'Hey, maybe it's time for writing a review?' Well, here it is...
48	1	a	This game is ♥♥♥♥ing horribad
50	1	a	Really great game, just needs a couple of lag fixes and more security, possibly VAC? Anyway, would reccomend for anyone who likes a great shooter. Customization is through the roof aswell.
52	1	a	There are plenty of things wrong with this game but in spite of this APB: Reloaded remains one of my all time most enjoyable games to play with friends.  Regardless of what most negative reviews will say this game is not pay to win. Cheats have been an issue for years though, and only recently has there been any significant response from Gamers First to combat them.  The biggest issue with the game is the matchmaking system, although it may work on a high populated game there just aren't enough players to split across 3 threat levels. Gold ranked districts are seldom active so even if they do not wish to gold ranked players are forced to 'de-threat' by playing bad till they become silver. Once these gold players are silver ranked they can play in the bronze districts till they log out and are not even forcibly removed once they reach gold again. As a result new players are thrown in at the deep end quite early in their APB career and quickly find they're out-matched and out-gunned.  If you're a hardcore first person or third person shooter fan you'll likely not enjoy this game. If you intend to play solo you will likely not enjoy this game. If however you have 1-3 friends to play with and are capable of not taking the game too seriously it's worthy of a download.  8/10
54	1	a	      TL;DR       Try the game and form your own opinion.       GREAT customization.       Really fun gunplay (and especially 'nadeplay')       There is a problem with hackers atm.       Engine update has been delayed several times.      First off, i want to say that this game gets much more hate than it deserves. It is almost like the COD hatetrain where everyone just throws hate at everything without doing any research.   The majority of the weapons on armas are  RESKINS  of weapons that already exist in the game, for example: Joker CR-5 = N-TEC 5, PSR = N-HVR, STAC = Joker SR15 etc. PLUS,  many of the unique weapons on armas can be bought from JOKER TICKETS which you gain by completing objectives in the fight club districts   Flamewars aside, there are some good things and some bad things with this game:   GUNPLAY
56	1	a	It's a fun game but has a rough environment.  Depending on the type of gamer you are this may or may not be for you. Can you deal with trolls everyday claiming you're a hacker because they simply can't aim? Are you calm and collected? The type to say 'Practice makes perfect'? Then this game is probably closer to being a fit than someone who doesn't possess those traits.  Game mechanics are a bit wonky and sometimes the developer's decisions are very questionable but all and all if you give it some time and some practice it's a fun game. With a new Engine upgrade coming (supposedly) in the foreseeable future there are bound to be rewards + extra prizes for just joining in so getting started now is not a bad idea either if you're currently taking a peak at the game.
58	1	a	ALL POINT BULLETIN RELOADED is Good game , a condition of being in a team and get along all the game play is nice but sometimes leaves the community has desired (good people , people without brains who are wicked and hackusate everyone player are cheater in mp ) and the real cheaters).  the thing to know is that &gt; have a fast connection and a computer with a real configuration of gamer to play with all the graphics to the fullest for your eyes.  Most players have a connection 100 mb / s download and 20 ms constant that is why they are fast and non-cheaters.  The best of this game is to remember especially the ability to create music, logos, creates a character who looks like us or be as desired, have a multitude of choices in clothing and to customize unlimited  The most important remains as fun to play, laugh a team with good funny time and be able to help some people who are new to this game  (I also recommend watching the lives of twitch to learn how to play this game and react while watching professional players, it is the best to become a player confirmed with real technicals and become logic with this game ) (all game have a strategical logic)
60	1	a	It's okay. Barely played it.
62	1	a	drive cars, cars are the secrets to winning
64	1	a	Brilliant idea.... The game looks amazing, little unbalanced at some points, but it's still kinda amazing... graphics is very good for a f2p type and the gameplay too. Everything customizable from characters, clothes to cars. Nice team based actions.. It would be way better If most of the ppl are not kids and also there is some annoying cheaters, but the game is good.. Recommended to only Hardcore/pro players. 8/10
66	1	a	Game has so much potential if it had the proper devs / game company backing it up... Still really fun to play if you have friends to play with.    7/10
68	1	a	What can I say? It's the biggest pile of crap I've ever played... Yet... I find myself playing it again and again  It's a pretty fun game...somehow...I don't know...I don't know anymore!!!  But yeah, give it a whirl! I like it, you might too!
70	1	a	I'd rather stick a fork in a power outlet than do missions in this game.  The KKK is nicer to black people than the APB community is to you.  This game is more pay to win than a casino.  There are more try-hards in this game than there are employed Americans.   Great customization though,  9.9/10
72	1	a	I love this game so much. Full of hackers, they are banned constantly yet more manifest immediately so you will never miss the real fun of dueling cheaters. If you were to look in the dictionary under 'bad game' you would find APB reloaded in great big bold letters at the top of the page, I don't know why, it's probably the best game ever made in my opinion. Hair too thick? Want to thin it out a bit? Play APB for twenty minutes and you'll look like a fourty year old dude in no time. Not sure why but I look more and more like my dad every day the more I play this game and hes been dead for thirty years. If you love to rage like nick cage, then pull up a chair and prepare to ♥♥♥♥ your pants. Kony for predident 2015.
74	1	a	$2109.75
76	1	a	An interesting game. You could even call it a 'GTA MMORPG'.   Positive:    Many people play it    It's Free    Plenty of entertaining tasks to do plus free roam     You can play with friends in a group and/or form a clan     Massively in-depth customization of characters, vehicles and more!    Large open worlds    Has an Anti-Cheat   Negative:    Demanding (Hardware wise)    Certain things which may give a slight gameplay advantage are buyable with real money    Slow loading time (On my PC which is below recommended but above minimal requirements)    May seem like a grind    May be difficult to learn at first    The launching of the game (After the steam download) is very buggy    You need to create an account to play    Not the best community in the world   Overall, a great game. The negative list, while longer than the positive list, is overcome by the positives, and this free game is definitely worth a try.  7/10
78	1	a	Good game -&gt; I Enjoy the design/customizable part the most!;
80	1	a	some play have be ask by are u go make home were we can stay at are have friend party but work for money to buy house some play have be talk by be nice u guy can make it are not fine but i be talk to 100+ play sec go and day go
82	1	a	Have 1000+ Hours on this game, played it for ages - Terrible customer service, known to randomly ban people.
84	1	a	Brilliant game, Lots of fun
86	1	a	some play have be ask by are u go make home were we can stay at are have friend party but work for money to buy house some play have be talk by be nice u guy can make it are not fine but i be talk to 100+ play sec go and day go
88	1	a	Its a lot of fun, but I wouldn't recommend it if you're one of those - like me - who gets frustrated when you die.  This is a game of skill. There's no classes and no real perks or talents that can give you an advantage in a fire fight. Buying weapons character modifications (such as body armor) can increase your chances, but only slightly and will not necessarily make it impossible for a new player to kill you if you make a mistake.
90	1	a	Seems like it's hard to avoid FairFight but elsewise 10/10.  Cool people  Seasonal events Intense gameplay  
92	1	a	Its automatically pay to win if someone is better than you. Fun game, been playing since 2011.
94	1	a	This game allows you to be a KKK member through customization.  I'd rate a dead African American/White Supremacy
96	1	a	Cool customization and everything, if you're lucky you'll get a hacker on your team, otherwise you'll be killed by hackers. Did I mention that they have hackers? Oh and its pay 2 win. So I hope you have some spare cash if you want to win most of the time! Still, its fun if you play for fun and with friends. So I guess its got that going for it.
98	1	a	The good things :  -Customizing tools for vehicules, characters, symbols editor tool. -Variety of weapons, unlockables sets -Good gameplay -Open worlds levels -Choice of your faction -Free to Play    The bad things :  -Sometimes unbalanced matchmaking -Some cheaters -Expensive content g1c price -Lags  Global Score : 8/10
100	1	a	APB was my life at one point, surprised I didn't turn suicidal.
102	1	a	I CAN SHOOT ♥♥♥♥♥, AND HAVE PONY SKINS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
104	1	a	I wish I could describe this game in just one or two paragraphs but it wouldn't do it justice. Ever wanted to play 'Cops N Robbers' in a big city in real-life, complete with real-life weapons and cars but can't? Then APB: Reloaded is the game for you. In the virtual world of San Paro, you can wield weapons , drive cars and engage in drive-bys, shoot-outs and various other law-enforcement or law-breaking activities depending on the side you choose.  This game has a huge variety of weapons like the Joker CR-5 assault rifle (in-game version of the M16), OCA-EW Submachine Gun (MP5), SHAW 556 LMG (MG4) as well as a good many choices for cars. It features bulky and tanky SUVs like the Nulander Pioneer (in-game version of the Chevrolet Tahoe) to speed demons such as the Patriot V20 Jericho (Shelby Mustang GT).  Don't get me started on the customisation level. It is truly out of this world. Symbols, decals, clothings - you got to see it for yourself to believe.  Create a character. Choose a side, choose a weapon, choose which piece of clothing to customise, choose a symbol, choose to make your own symbol, choose your outfit, choose your alter-ego and...choose to have fun by playing APB.  Choose to...be all that you can't be.
106	1	a	After sinking alot of hours and money into this game I think I can review it. When I first started playing around 3 years ago it was great and I instantly fell in love with it, I spent money on G1C and made cars, clothing and bought guns and had fun designing different personas and because the customization is amazing you could make Miley Cyrus, make a tour van, get guns to suit her, make your theme when you kill someone her song and make your tour van blast out an entire song of hers. Or you could just make ♥♥♥♥♥ and hentai like 80% of people do there. The game in that sense is amazing but when it comes to combat it is still fun for the most part but has horrible matchmaking, hitboxes, ranking system. Lets say you are a Trainiee (The lowest rank and level 9) and you press K to ready up in a mission you will most likely get put against a Gold level 205 who has no fall damage, kevlar, fast car and a rocket launcher and that completely ruins the experience and they've even added a district with NO matchmaking so whoever presses K to enter a mission gets put with anyone and to me that seems like a cheap way to add stuff to the game without trying to fix anything and lets say you were to pull up next to your friend and run over his toe at 2mph he will die... INSTANTLY and that just makes the whole combat feel slow, broken and horrible.  There are three sets of money in this game, dollars, Joker Tickets and G1C, dollars are earned by selling on the ingame markey place, so cars and symbols, songs and themes and are earned by doing missions, killing people on bounty and such, its grindy to earn as a cop and ok to earn as a criminal as you can simply steal from stores on a low populated district and earn around 100k in a couple of hours but it gets broken by the fact that premium members who pay for membership get more money per mission and such and so the person whos talented at designing songs or symbols or who has the money to buy premium gets richer faster. Joker tickets are earned by completeling a set of objectives in Fight Club districts where its basically team deathmatch and you will get notifications like 'Kill 5 people with granades' and you will get another after that and then you can earn Joker Tickets. These can be spent on getting temporary perks like car surfer to ride on cars or normally expensive weapons and cars, the next currency in the game is G1C this is real money in the Gamers First market place and its where the pay to win comes into play. You can either be like me and spend £350+ in the game and get 3 legendary weapons, alot and alot of cars, premium and symbols and stuff, or you can get lucky and buy a box for £4 and then get a legendary weapon worth millions in game but this marketplace is horrid, its all pay to win weapons and really makes the game not very fun to play when against someone with weapons from the store.   Customer Service from Gamers First is also horrible, I got banned about 2 years ago, maybe a year and a half ago for no reason, they said that I used an aimbot and such but i've never even downloaded one and after spending about £200 in the game at this point I was annoyed, I contacted them and explained my situation and even offered them to scan my PC using teamviewer or screenshots of my APB folders and game but they all said every time 'Theres nothing we can do, you are banned forever' and I gave up on the game and forgot about it for a month and tried to login and I was unbanned, so its very strange and I still dont have an explination for the ban to this day. Customer service hardly respond quickly and they always respond with an automated response, no real human so thats a massive dissapointment.  The missions consist of 'Capture this, deliver this, break this, steal this, deliver this, do this, go here' and you can do ALL of that, literally do ALL of that and then if your opposition has the better shot or gun you will lose the mission because at the end of EVERY mission it all comes down to who has the better car or gun. As a criminal you will most of the time be breaking into winwos and setting doors on fire to steal hard drives and deliver them, you can do ALL 5 set of missions before the end deathmatch and still lose the mission but if you are an enforcer and you stop the cirminal delivering the first hard drive congrats. You win. The missions you can for the most part live with but after a while they start repeating and get quickly boring so you'll find yourself in the Fight Club districts or the Asylum in team deathmatch just to spice things up or you'll find yourself in the very fun new dynamic missions that are present in the regular districts where they resemble the most recent Christmas event where you find a granade launcher and you need to kill 15 other players who try to kill you before delivering it to a contact, the granade launcher gives you buffed health and a buffed launcher.  Overall this game is very fun at parts but very very annoying at times so if you can put up with the Pay to win, the small amount of hackers, the bad combat, the boring missions and the horrible customer support to play a game that resembles a bad GTA with AMAZING customization then this game is great. I can put up with it so I love it, its my favorite game of all time so far and it still is even though it has its flaws and faults I love it and theres rumors going around that G1C are making a new game engine with updated graphics, physics and such so maybe, just maybe if its true and released before this game dies it will change the entire game for the better.  TL;DR: A very buggy game with awful combat, pay to win players, customer support, matchmaking, updates but its worth it if you like customization and want a game where you can make a million personas with cars, songs, symbols and clothes and if you can put up with the bad things you will fall in love with this game.
108	1	a	Join US OBEYA  NAME: xRos3
110	1	a	A really good game to play with friends. You need a beast computer tho
112	1	a	You can make some really cool stuff
114	1	a	The Best Game in the world purchased by a ♥♥♥♥ development team Gamers First a.k.a. (Money First) and Reloaded Productions. The game was made free to play and has a large cheater problem. How ever if you are able to get past the eventual match vs some one with super human speeds and aimbots this game can be very rewarding with a long progression goal. The player base is really small at this point and if they ever come through with their promises of the Unreal Engine Upgrade (Soon™) this game will take off again. Cheating situation is being addressed in a major way with FairFight and PunkBuster and GM administration Tiggs but slow reactions scared alot of player base away that may never come back even after the issue is taken care of. Streaming this game on Twitch become bother some as the toxic community constantly can interrupt your game play for kicks of trolling you on camera. Even giving all the BS this game has gone through it is still fun and will always have a piece of heart in many gamers around the wold..
116	1	a	pay 2 win and hackers ruined the game, but apart from that it's a good concept and fun to play with your friends
118	1	a	Everything about this game is fun, where you can do almost everything with this game such as editing and customizing your car, cloth, outfits, characters, etc. and you can also making musics, themes, tatoos, symbols, etc. . This game is also testing your mental and skills none like others where you need to be efficient and wise for you find and know the tactic and best ways or strategy to win the mission.  KEEP IN MIND If you're too good with killings and tactics, other players mostly will accuse you of hacking, especially from at the server EU1 and EU2, and this will lead you to get banned (which is not fair, be careful if you choose to play at these server). Most good player get banned because of beeing too good with the killings, Rank prove nothing when you or your friends or your opponents or other players got the skills.
120	1	a	Game with crazy potential, ruined by lagg and a bad company.
122	1	a	Extremely underated game.
124	1	a	Have you ever heard of a G.T.A MMO ? Well, this is it!  APB: Reloaded offers a different type of gameplay than other free-to-play games. Not only you can play missions with your friends and play competitively to rank up, you can also customize your own character and personal car, make your own theme song and make your own clothes. You can definitely be unique in this game!  Give it a try and you'll see what this game is all about!
126	1	a	Good game, despite of those cheaters :P
128	1	a	very very addictive..I can't really leave this game..  p.s: my gameplay time is 500+hrs, not 100 hrs..
130	1	a	One of the best online experiences i've ever had. Hours of PvP action, a very detailed character/car customization system, even a music theme maker! If you like the setup of cops vs bad guys, this is your best option. Each character in the world has a very unique aspect and you feel unique in a massive online world.
132	1	a	i hate this game so much but holy ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ me if i don't love it 10/10
134	1	a	THS GAME MAKES FOR A GOOD WANKING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! its great you can change the boobie size there is also a mod for acctual nakedness so ♥♥♥♥ing hot omg that APB pussay all noght long ;) #whoneedshentai
136	1	a	Do you want to play a game where you can steal cars...drive them and destroy them because you always wanted to do it? Or do you want to shoot the sh*t out of your enemy and enjoy the physics of the dead body flying from that building you shot him before? Or do you just want to play GTA online? This ♥♥♥♥♥♥ awesome game does include every aspect mentioned! Play as a crime or an enforcer, it is your choice.
138	1	a	My experience of APB Reloaded in a nutshell  I pressed k Game puts me in match against enforcers lvl 1000+ We have to defend teh wepoons 2 enforcers get rekt by our mighty forces of criminals Jimmy gets rekt by a bomb There's 4 of us left defending teh wepoons We get ambushd by 2 enforcers with grenades We r all ded Enforcers capture wepoons Jimmy joins back in only to get rekt 3 seconds after he spawns by a big bulky car The rest respawn and go to the next defense point with their supercars,but leave me alone in the middle of nowhere Half of the team dies again because they got rekt by car with 3 people in it The rest of us shoot the car Guy in the back of car shoots a missile at Billy He and hitman dies Im alone 4 enforcers leave their cars and try to kill me They start shooting a car while i take cover Car explodes making every other conviniently placed car to explode and kill me I respawn and get shot by a pikachu I respawn and go with a little group of the team We shoot enforcers and kill them A group of enforcers kill us I respawn only for a garbage bus to smoosh me I respawn with Jimmy and we go on a magical trip together All of a sudden, bonnie appears out of nowhere,throws a giant grenade at us and kill us Everyone in team is ded for unknown reasons Enforcers destroy the remaining wepoons and we lose  11/10 would press k again
140	1	a	I have many many more hours pre-steam on ABP it has always been a pay to win but there is a chance to stand above the rest without spending money. (salty)
142	1	a	Hit a guy with a car , he flew atleast 50m into the air while having an uncontrollable seizure.  12/10
144	1	a	I love this game. When I have a bad day at work, I can get on here and blast someone in the face with a shotgun.
146	1	a	i cound not even play as it has mass lag on the update screen 
148	1	a	I recommend this game cause I say so!
150	1	a	This game is literally crack. It will addict you and eat your soul. 10/10 would smoke
152	1	a	Got killed by NPC car. 10/10
154	1	a	Personally, I really like this game, and have devoted quite a while into it. The patches and all do move along at a somewhat slow rate, given the small dev team, but I think its actually a really good game. I read some of the other reviews and I will address some of the issues mentioned.  Pay2Win- Basically every gun in the ARMAS Marketplace is a reskin of a gun you get from in-game progression, and the few execeptions have lots of downsides to balance their upsides. Anyone who claims that guns are p2w most likely hasn't gone to the cash shop and trialed the guns, which by the way, you can do, trialing all of the guns for 30minutes/3hours depending if you have premium membership. Really though, the in-game progression weapons are on par, or even better than their cash shop counterparts.  Hackers-  This community is so paranoid of hackers, its pretty much a given that either one person might seem like they are hacking, or you will get hackusated. Just realize that its possible that people are better than you, because some people have been around 4-5 years, since the start in RTW times.  Lag- At the time of this post, one of the districts, Waterfront, has been rather laggy, but they have been working on a fix for it, and the lag only occurs when there are more than 60 people per instance (excess people can move to a different instance to fight the lag, but sometimes they just don't)  Okay, and one more thing, its not as if you are paying $60 + DLC galore, its a free game. I understand this game might not be for everyone, mainly people that can't accept that people are better than them, and resort to calling people hackers or calling weapons p2w. Give it a shot, though, because it truly is pretty good quality for a f2p game.  
156	1	a	Nice game
158	1	a	this game is like, the ♥♥♥♥, ballz, n ♥♥♥♥
160	1	a	Still one of the best shooter MMOs on the net. What I personally keep in mind when thinking of APB is the most unfriendly community someone can imagine. If you have a good run, they call you a hacker, if you have a bad run, you're called a 'r3t4rd': Laugh or Leave! ;)
162	1	a	Amazing level of character customization.   pay2win? no.. its not.   Let me start with taking away the illusion of the pay2win aspect. APB is a free2play game and gives you a slightly 'limited' version if you're not willing to upgrade your account with 'Premium'. So what is this Premium Membership actually giving you?  A Premium Membership for APB can be bought through the Armas Marketplace, and sometimes can be received free through Redeem Codes and joker boxes, this gives players several advantages in the field.   Premium Benefits Up to a 90% bonus to all Contact Standing (XP) Gains. 125% bonus to all APB$ gains. 20% discount in the Armas Marketplace. 50% reduced cooldown on activated abilities (e.g., Field Supplier, Nitro Booster). Advanced access to Customization Suites (50 Symbols per Vehicle / Clothing item. 100 layers per Symbol). Extended duration for Armas Trials for Weapon and Vehicle Trials.  The rest of the Armas Marketplace offers weapons, vehicles/kits and clothing. These available so called 'pay2win' weapons are merely re-skins and have the same statistics as already existing in-game weapons. Some might have slightly different statistics, but can still easily be beaten by the standard weapons. Also some of these Armas weapons, vehicles and kits are also available at the in-game Joker Store for a period of time by the use of Joker Tickets earned in Fight Club or with Daily Activities. If anything this game is 'pay2pretty'. ALL weapons ingame are available either in the joker store for JT, on the player market APB$, or on ARMAS for free trial.   -partial credit to Siuya and G1/RP for armas info-
164	1	a	its fun and free
166	1	a	Play with friends to enjoy this game!
168	1	a	TL;DR: Not p2w or filled with haxors, is actually fun to play.   When you start this game will be kinda cool, then as you rank-up it will be just a ♥♥♥♥. Then why am i recommending ? because when you just start, people who paid for their weapons will seem like they are overpowered, they are not.   The only problem is the premium system but they didnt lower anything to sell people premium. Its just a booster and the only bad side of it is the limits to customization, i dont want to discourage you or anything but either ways you will end up buying stuff off the market. If you want to check it out you can get around 20 days of free premium via codes and stuff. (It will seem like a problem because you will see lots of people with premium, progressing a lot faster than you. They are just trying to sell it by forcing you to see it, its not good, though afterall they gotta make some money out of it.)   Lots of people will tell you this game is full of hackers and its a p2w game. I'm not on the same page with them.    Everyone is a hacker if you are trying to blame someone. People called me a hacker too. This game had serious problems with hackers but now they are mostly cleaned, if you think there's a hacker or someone whos highly skilled, just change the server and you should be fine. Also dont rage in chat, that wont help you, dont team kill either.     People talk about pay to win, no its not. Yes you can buy weapons earlier but those guns are not op, me and my friends were able to kill those people easily with normal weapons.   Just talk with people, get into a clan with some high-ranked people. Play with them and ask whatever you are struggling with. Lots of community guides are available out there, dont be afraid to read !
170	1	a	Somewhat fun, but HORRIBLY broken.  Broken matchmaking, Broken grouping, very cheap overused gun combinations, heavily promotes being a horrible player and camping.  Luckily this game is hanging by a string, it will be dead from lack of funds soon.
172	1	a	this game is ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ing lags on my nasa computer poor optimisation ♥♥♥♥♥♥ gfx i hate this game sucks my big balls and you have to pay to win it sucks only 27 cars its ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ing sucks man id rather play mario super bros which has better gfx and ♥♥♥♥ and fps and i love that game oldschool ♥♥♥♥ n stuff you know but apb ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed is a big failure dont play this game unless you are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ piece of ♥♥♥♥ lots of hacking ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s trailers always look better than the game itself because of photoshop and editing stuff like adding colors effects but i ♥♥♥♥ing hate this game ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of bugs and lagging cars wtf cars dont even scratch wtf gta 4 is better play that game instead i love gta4 niko bellec and roman lets go bowling lol in apb u cant go bowling and play darts and drink all you do is kill ppl and drive with your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ car in pink ill give it 11/10

178	1	a	very good game. its like gta but without the strippers. i think the only problem with this game is is that there arent any tutorials or how tos when you first start so your kinda on your own in terms of how to customize things. friend me: thatguy622
180	1	a	Great Game I mean you can pick your liffe on this crim or enforcer or turn An enforcer in to something you want what i did is i made my enforcer a police officer i am one of the best lawenfocement desiners on colby Server

190	1	a	THE BEST GAME IN THE WORLD 
192	1	a	Kinda cheap at times, hard on noobs, addictive as hell!
194	1	a	At first, the game is a bit hard to get into. Right off the bat, you are teamed up against skilled veterans of the game, which can be very frustrating for new players. Just like in any other game, there are a variety of different players: some good and some bad. The customization in this game is incredible! Litterally, you can make a ton of different symbols, different costumes in this game to individualize yourself from the rest of the players. If you like to be unique, or an artist then this game is for you.
196	1	a	I like it. Awesome character customization, nice music tracks. Crazy car physics, driving and drifting is very fun.  But in free version too little layers and slots for making tracks, clothing, etc.  But the worst part is this game is un-optimized. It eats too much memory and lags pretty frequently.  Almost forgot, there are many hackers... &lt;_&lt;
198	1	a	(Note: I have not played this game in many years).  So, this can be a fun game.. The community sucks, but it can be fun at times. I'm just going to put an up-vote on it simply for the good times I had on it (while at the same time trying not to think of the bad times). I could make a really serious, thoughtful review, like usual. I even typed one up and erased it.   You know what, I'll make a somewhat decent review. That sounds nice. So:   Lag: There is a lot of it. Everyone on the server lags, Heck, the server itself lags. Try out the two closest servers to you. I used to play on one server that I thought would be the best for me, but it turned out that the next closest one was better. The difference was barely noticable while playing, but it made all of the difference.  Hackers: Are there any? For the most part, not really. At least when I used to play, there were not.There were a few rare cases, but it was not often. What I noticed when changing from one server to the other is that I lagged just half a second less than other people, letting my hits register like they were supposed to and everything worked normally. Different connections to the server can make a big difference.  Pay to win: This game is really big on paying for weapons with real cash. There are a few guns that simply can't (in my opinion) be beaten that are hard to buy ingame with ingame money. One of these is a sniper rifle that makes it really easy to jump into the air and shoot someone with extreme accuracy. No other gun in the game has this ability. There are ways to get it without paying a dime, however it is difficult to do, and the weapons will probably expire after a while. (Note: while pay-to-win weapons do give people an advantage, skill plays a lot into it. If you take the standard, default rifle, if my memory is correct I believe it was named the STAR, you can usually hold your own. It is reliable close up and at a medium to long distance.)  Note: I have way more hours than steam shows, and I have never put a single penny into this game. It isn't/wasn't necessary.  Creativity/customization: There are tons of different ways to be creative and customize your character. You can make your own symbols, put said symbols on cars, clothes, etc. You can also change the looks/parts of the cars after unlocking the parts. You can even make music/theme songs. If you are a premium player, you are able to do more with the symbol creator, and able to own more things, but you can get by without it.  Matchmaking: From what I remember it kinda sucked. They changed it a few months before I quit playing and tried to match people by rank. Being a higher rank, I found it really difficult to get into a match. There were times when I repeatedly faced the same four or five people over and over. Not sure if they ever fixed this.  Frustration: Expect it.  What else.. what else.. hmmm....  Friends! Yes, definantly play with friends. It makes the game more bearable. Playing by yourself will probably cause you to get burnt out quickly.  Oh, one last thing. It used to be fun to just hang out with friends and horse around. Running eachother over, stunning/shooting eachother, etc., but they added an auto kick feature that kicks you for a bit after a certain number of team kills/stuns or damage. That ruined quite a bit of the fun.    Well, I guess that does it for the Serious-ish review!   So, now to what I really wanted to say:  So, you may already know that police (enforcers) get stun guns, like tazers and bean-bag rifles, to stun and arrest criminals. I got pretty good with those. They are extremely frustrating to the criminals, but that was not why I used them. They were hard to use, risky, and caused me a lot of deaths. People don't stay down forever you know. But eventually I unlocked the crowning jewel of the Non-Leathal weaponry. The Non-Leathal Grenade Launcher. Oh boy, those were the days. Me and a bright orange grenade launcher stunning and arresting anyone and everyone that I could find. Good times. And yes, I was *that* guy, lol.
200	1	a	This is an incredible game, I love it!
202	1	a	its nice but too much hackers
204	1	a	+ In-depth character, clothing &amp; car design tools + Blend of tactical and skill-based shooter mechanics + Team oriented game play + Friendly towards players with slower Internet  - Matchmaking could be improved - Armas real cash store pricing can be absurd at times  If third person shooters are your thing, and you are looking to really create an identity for yourself that focuses as much on teamwork and tactics as much as gear and skills that offers plenty of core content as enough sillyness and social aspects to keep to game fresh and amusing you’ll have a blast with APB  How does this GTA inspired MMO measure up?

206	1	a	The game's customs is what makes it fun. The gameplay you have to have patience with your self and the game, cause if you dont you will get tired of it real quick. Other than that the game is MAD fun XDD
208	1	a	still a good game but i hate the punkbusters kik me out need help!!!!  How to remove sever files ??  it says cannot create an file if there is already exist???  some one help please!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1

212	1	a	Alot better than what it was if you havn't played it give it a shot. And if you quit becuase of hackers than come back to play becuase the new anti cheat is a charm.
214	1	a	I have a s**t tone of hours on this game and that shows how much I like it, but theres 2 things G1 need's to fix and those are the sudden FPS drops and the HORRIBLE BULLS**T MATCHMAKING that just ruins the expirience,As for the good stuff, each of the factions has their owns advantages and disadvantage(Crims can ram-raid, Enfs can arrest them for example). Overhall i think my review is c*ap and just go play the game for youreself and see what side and play style suits you folks best.Have fun!  Oh and the rating is about 8.5/10 :P 
216	1	a	ok sure this game is unfair with the most bs anyones ever seen but nonetheless its ♥♥♥♥ing fun and in the end whether i lose win rage or brag this game never stops making my day better and i hope all the hate ends soon i love this game as much as ARCHEBLADE that was droped by the devs. plz dont let this game go away
218	1	a	i like this game becuz GTA 5 is not out yet :)
220	1	a	You shoot people, or atleast you think you shot them.
222	1	a	lol i dont even need to talk about this aids
224	1	a	Can't say too much as I haven't played the game that much, but it's okay I guess. Play it with friends and you'll enjoy it.
226	1	a	+ It's a good game, graphics are amazing and it's multiplayer. - It's hard to drive and make actions. + Criminals makes easy cash - Enforcers steal your stuff to earn cash on it + Private Cars - Public vehicles can be stolen from you with the loot in + Free to play +++ BRUTAL multiplayer game with Constant action all the time  Rating: 7/10 Additional comment: The gameplay is awesome, I love this game. There are only 2 things that annoyes me: #1: Other people stealing your car if it's not private... #2: Enforcers busting you in action... They can easily catch you up if you don't have driving skills
228	1	a	Ok game, if you don't have 50€ to buy GTA is that perfect game!  7/10
230	1	a	This Game is fun, but it isnt very friendly to new players. recomended if you plan on sticking with it. very hard to get fair kills without premiums
232	1	a	I really like this game. It´s fun to play with friends. I very mouch like the desgin of cars (they are beautiful (most of them)). It´s free so why do not try it? Just one thing that maked me soooooooo ANGRY was that I created my account on Europe server and when I was about rank 80 it stopped work for me (Jericho server works for me) so I lost all my progress because I can´t spawn on map cause it disconnect me (It won´t load the map). And one thing that is sad is that if you download this game it´s free but if you want a permanent weapon (you got one default and one of your choice for free) you will need to pay real money or in-game 1000 000 Cash at the auctions. And there is so mouch content that you will unlock only trough real money. But I reccomend the game. I mean 8 from 10 points of game quality at all.  But thing that i like most is the Vehicle, Clothing and Character customization! it´s impossible that two players have same looking Character! Vehicles can be customized in many different ways... you can change body parts or engine sound, add turbo, add police lights  (if you are Enforcer), or you can repaint parts of your vehicle and add stickers-(you can win stickers, buy them or create!) There is a lot of things to do.
234	1	a	It's hate and lvoe realationship with this game. You like it or you don't , and the community can be cancer. Not for faint at heart.
236	1	a	Most of these reviews are about the new company that controls the game not the game itself. Heres me 2 cents. Advanced customizeation Just look at its community Hub Art. new Content every month or so. Cops and Robbers dynamic.  Heres some of the bad P2W but possible to win as f2p just harder. Demanding On your CPU even with your Beast PC rig apb will make it crawl to its knees (its built on an old engine) Hackers well thats a problem everywhere but since then apb has Fairfight and Punkbuster so hackers only last a few days. Lastly Armas marketplace (p2w in a nutshell)  Theres alot of other problems but i still love the game and its free So... Quit Your Bitcin'
238	1	a	I wish i could stop playing this game
240	1	a	Very exciting! Especially when you are lagging.
242	1	a	I recommend this game but the servers lag so much.
244	1	a	I returned to this game today after quitting about 2 years ago. After playing 10 minutes I noticed the huge changes and good ones at that, the game runs a lot smoother than when it was first released. And now with the addition of Fair Fight I cant wait log in huge amounts of hours. Keep up the good work!  PS. do not change the driving physics, I liked them 2 years ago because you can drift around corners pretty well and you are able to still to that in game today, Thank you again!
246	1	a	I recommend this game but the servers lag so much.
248	1	a	My friends play this and I listen to them play it on skype and it seems like a piece of ♥♥♥♥.
250	1	a	!!!!!
252	1	a	It's ♥♥♥♥. Don't bother if you dont have a group of friends with good computers to handle the performance issues, even in the 'newbie' districts(matchmaking lobbies, whatever you want to call them) there's groups of premade high-ranked long term players flushing new players out 24/7 and its just no fun going 0/50 against people with rocket launcher while you yourself only have a ♥♥♥♥ing peashooter and not even grenades, or knowledge of the game mechanics, gun stats, cars, geometry...  GamersLast the developer/publisher LOVES putting in overpowered cashshop only guns, adding to the frustrating ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that is full maxrank premades with p2w ♥♥♥♥ tryharding so hard that the game thats casual as ♥♥♥♥ becomes 0 fun
254	1	a	My friends play this and I listen to them play it on skype and it seems like a piece of ♥♥♥♥.
256	1	a	It's an awesome game, best played with friends but once you get into it you can have hours of fun. Never gotten bored of it, it has awesome graphic's, fun gameplay, character creation, just lots and lots of fun. Highly recomended
258	1	a	Although I have only played a little, it is a very fun and good game that isn't full of hackers no matter how bad bad players say there are. You can see that the negative reviews are from people with less than 10 hours. gg
260	1	a	This is personally my opinion on the game, I don't intend on making people flame in the comments because of what i say.   People say that the game is dead but it really isn't. It can seem like that when there are many full server, which leaves all the low populated ones but most of the time you can find a server with a lot of people.   The server ranks which are Bronze, Silver, and Gold really should have a requirement on them because Gold and silver threat players are usually on Bronze threat servers which makes it harder for a Bronze Player to become silver or Gold. And some of the higher threat players do say rude things to Bronze players, but your threat level doesn't necessarily mean that you above or below someone and doesn't mean someone is more skilled than other people. I've met many Bronze players who are better than Gold players, but i still don't think that it's fair for them to go on low level servers. It just so happens that the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ match making is what makes people stop playing the game.   Don't get me wrong, the game is still really fun to play, but the match making is just horrible. I'm a bronze player and i got put with a bunch of gold players and ended being yelled at for dying so many times and coming in last place because my team mates would kill me each time i tried to complete something, i even waited for an oppistion and they were still killing me, but one of them did get banned because of Fair-fight monitoring.   Not all silver and gold players are rude. In fact, I've met some really cool people on the game that happened to be gold players.  I'm not trying to bash the gold and silver players but that's just a big problem for most people.  Then there's the Armas Market.  I personally don't care too much about it but if you have money that you can spend on the game, you can get better weapons, cars, and mods. I'm almost positive that you can't use game money in the market so most people are stuck grinding for guns and mods. And believe me it takes a long time. First you have to rank up and then you have to earn the money and some weapons are only accessible with certain roles that are completed. I actually prefer to do this since i don't feel like spending $10-$20 on a decent gun for a game i got for free.   This was not meant to be negative in any way but I'm just saying what should be said.  So despite the negativity in this review, I actually recommend this game.   The graphics are nice and the customization is pretty much limitless as long as you have plenty of decals and such. Plus it's fun to play with friends. I actually call up a few friends every now and then and do group missions with them because you can use your mic and talk to them.  I also suggest that anyone who buys this game should friend anyone they enjoyed playing with and form a clan with them or join one. And if you liked the team you played with you can always try to group up with them.  &gt;u&lt; I'm actually not a person who's an expert at giving reviews so if you would kindly refrain from calling me any rude names, that would be very much appreciated XD
262	1	a	Multiplayer online free to play (and pay to win) GTA-like game with Cops &amp; Robbers theme. Very huge customization options. You can actually make any character you want. You can even design your own clothes and then you can wear them or sell them to other players. Pretty fun except playing against cheaters in like 25% of the matchups. Also the community is very toxic.
264	1	a	  I have close to 2k hours on this game upon writing this, and here are the facts. 
266	1	a	P2W drama. Egos the size of the sun. Hacksators the amount of BR's with choppy internet. And people who don't know the difference between a remesh and a reskin.
268	1	a	I guess it can be fun sometimes.
270	1	a	Good game very good moments, when you kill the music began to play, and it's a little amusing than usual than playing music, usually just kills me in this game the best. I suggest to play this and you will get better. Only the lack of Lithuanian language if it then it would be 10 out of 10 and is now only 8.5.
272	1	a	Well, it's fun. Frustrating, bad, dumb game. But fun. I like being able to make your own cars, but the parts are expensive. This is a potential game-of-the-year that, really, really was in the wrong hands, and still is.
274	1	a	ive played this game for 10,000hrs
276	1	a	I won't say it's fun to play, but it is when you have friends! It's always fun to play with friends and go kill some enforcers or criminals on the streets. I don't recommend playing it alone unless you have patience and skills to carry yourself to the top. The game is fun but full of annoying lag, hackers, bugs, and etc. I would recommend this game, but after playing it in a few days I will asure you, you will go cray cray like me! xD But all in all it's a fun game when playing with friends, I suggest you to have patience and skills to be on top, and probably have fun! That's my review for this game hope you enjoy the game as much as I do.
278	1	a	THIS GIEM RIGHT HEER, THIS GIEM, THIS GIEM RIGHT HEER, YEAH.
280	1	a	If you hate having fun and want to end your life on a low note, this is the game for you!
282	1	a	I've hardly played this game and my friend loves it. I never gor into it but he thinks its pretty cool.... so i guess i'll reccomend it.
284	1	a	This is one of the most fun games i have ever played!   But. This can get really annoying with all the hackers and players that are on the wrong server (Gold on Bronze and Silver). 
286	1	a	I've tried the game.  It was fun.
288	1	a	PROS: Cops vs Robbers Extreme Customization for Character Extreme Customization for Cars Lots of Guns Two Open World Maps Modifications that affect the player, cars and guns  CONS: New players at a disadvantage (need to unlock everything) Hitreg can sometimes be a problem Not enough players for fair balanced matches most of the time
290	1	a	its a very good game 
292	1	a	Quite fun, but really hard pay-to-win game, so it destroys alot of play joy. Still fun to play though
294	1	a	At first glance, APB Reloaded seemed stagnant and dry, like the barren tundra of a retired ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥'s once fertile ravine. The experience was shallow and the sense of accomplishment was too few and far between, leaving the uncertainty that a virgin feels after what may have been an instance of date ♥♥♥♥ ; could one even call that a victory at all?  Now, standing at the frontier of this outlaw's paradise, I find myself wondering : am I playing this game, or is this game playing me?
296	1	a	APB Reloaded is almost the free Grand Theft Auto Online but you can be a cop or crook so this game is very interesting to play so i would this game out of scale 10 9.5 out of 10
298	1	a	It's a really good game if you are not facing a full team of P2W people. There should be seperate districts for people who pay for this game and they can't choose non P2W districts. 8/10
300	1	a	A periodically over-the-top aggressive game but otherwise quite fun. It's a little hard to compare it to other games as for its mechanics in depth are quite diverse. Driving is sort of weird and could be compared to ice skating. Shooting in-game is pretty fun but yet again, hard to compare it to another game. Graphics are a bit out of date but hey, this game was made a while ago. Its freeroam and mission based PvP servers are nice while having servers with open PvP have their perks too  Unfortunately this is one of those P2P or P2W kind of games but its really fun gameplay no matter if you pay money or not.  All in all, I would suggest this game to anyway who likes choosing what side of the law they want to help (by help I mean shooting at people your told to shoot at.)
302	1	a	oh yaeh cop and robbers
304	1	a	I like it so should u its free so try it
306	1	a	GTA 2.0, Awesome Experience.
308	1	a	.
310	1	a	Awsome game
312	1	a	Stole a gaming computer 10/10
314	1	a	who cares
316	1	a	One of my favorite games! It's free, big thumbsup for great graphics and customization.   Although not a big fan of the server matching over the years by threat level, such as bronze, silver, or gold, not many play on gold now, but all mass around silver threat servers.   Fun PvP teamwork and gameplay. Nice storyline for your enforcer/criminal character as well with your AI contacts that you do missions for, and you can gain contact rating by doing the PvP, as well as unlocking more items.
318	1	a	To start, I am very on the fence about ABP Reloaded. The techniques used by Gamersfirst are not what I would expect from a dev, but I'm not them so I have no opinion from their POV.   The overall gameplay of it is quite fun and can bring you hours upon hours of fun... Chasing after some criminals you just saw smash their van into a jewlery story and robbed it dry can be immense fun. Or perhaps you're the one who just mugged a drug dealer walking down the street, you now have to sell the drugs, and launder the cash all while avoiding the keen eye of the hackers you are playing against. Oops I meant cops... my bad.  Though it lacks in variety during your gaming experience (Your variety of objectives is quite limited). It is still a cops vs robbers game. Like when you were a child, only now it is virtual. The amount of detail though, is rather high. It has a built in 'photoshop' where players can fully customize and design graphics for nearly any item you can aquire. The game has a built in community auction house for buying/trading your cars and guns or anything you want, between other players. You have the ability to import your own music (Or you could when I played last), which is refreshing. Listening to whatever you want.  The graphics, depending on your hardware can range from sufferable to quite fantastic. It's no farcry 3 but with a quality PC you will have a hard time not enjoying yourself atleast a little. Not including bugs/glitches that come with the game, you will come across your fair share of hackers... It does ruin the experience. Not to mention... but i'm going to... Gamersfirst has consistently released patches that were... broken to say the least and I feel on a personal level, that the attitude the devs show towards the game has possibly scared some players away. It has done that to me in the past.  In my not-so-humble opinion, It feels to me as if the game tries to lure you in. Once you've invested enough time and effort into hittting a certain rank, that the only way to further yourself is to become a premium member... I mean why not, you get not only almost double the Exp/$ per mission, but you also get a 50% reduced cooldown on your abilites (Wait... you pay for that passive skill?) plus a whole bunch of other junk to sweeten the deal, which in return will make you stronger. But then you will also need the premium guns, to match your bad-assness, which don't come with the premium service... but atleast you get a 20% discount in the micro-transaction store, to intice you to spend more real life currency. Sweet deal eh? Nah... I don't reccomend you buy premium unless you are truly going to invest time into the game.  Customization - 8/10 Story - 5/10 Music - 9/10 (Import your own :)) Gameplay - 6/10 Graphics - 7/10 Overall I would recommend this game to anyone who has player cops vs robbers as a child and wants to expand that experience into a virtual one.
320	1	a	It's neat, I guess.
322	1	a	Is a fun game if you like Fps..   :3
324	1	a	Pros - Customizability. Yes there is a limit when you have a free acount when it comes to decals on cars and clothes but it is still a lot that you can fo.  - Getting together with friends. APB is quite a lot of fun with a lot of friends and you just mess around the entire time  -Gameplay. Even though many people find it repititive i still found it quite enjoyable to play and I think have logged something like 200/300 hours into this game.   Cons: -Terrible servers -Terrible developers  - Hackers. Hackers everywhere.
326	1	a	This is a great game to play! So far iv seen simple controls and fairly simple gameplay! It mixes a few of my favorite things! Guns, cars and costumization! I absolutly put this game in my top 5! Amazing!
328	1	a	**BOTH THUMBS UP AND DOWN**  Cons: It took forever to install, and  Forever to load the the game    Pros: When it did load witch one like 1 outta the 7 times i tried to run it  it was a good game no lag in it great cars, graphics, guns   **IF YOU HAVE EVER PLAYED THE GRAND THEFT AUTO SERIES THIS IS FOR YOU!! ONLY THIS GAME IS FREE, AND DOES NOT COST MONEY LIKE THE GTA SERIES!! SO THATS WHY I WILL HAVE TO THUMBS THIS GAME UP BECAUSE ITS FREE!!** 
330	1	a	It may be a ♥♥♥♥♥ some times but when it works it rocks! i love the game because of its beauty and potential. some people see a trash game without any good things in it. i see a unfinished game that can turn into a awesome game! may be kind of a pay to win game but that just means you gotta upgrade yo skillz!
332	1	a	While this game is considerably pay-to-win, I still find it has a certain appeal to it, despite that being a large downfall. I enjoy it with friends, mostly, this game seems to fall short when you play solo, it becomes more frustrating than anything. My main problem is the ranking system. There are four skill groups; Green, Bronze, Silver, and Gold. The skill groups work, but the issue is - Gold's can play in Silver servers, and Silver's can play in Bronze servers. This leads to the Gold servers never having more than three people at a time in each, forcing all Gold players into Silver servers and shaving a large amount of Exp and Cash from their missions. It also forces the Silver players into Bronze servers, solely for the fact that the skill difference between groups is large enough, that it's hard to play against the next rank above you.
334	1	a	As far as customisation goes, this game is amazing. Also, the way it enforces (pun intended) teamwork between complete strangers is very good. But, in my opinion, it takes itself too seriously and that can drain the fun out of it sometimes. I think it needs some sillier aspects, but that's just me. Overall, 6/10
336	1	a	This game will suck your 3-incher out of your mum's mouth. 8/10 sucks major chode #stillforfreedoe
338	1	a	Quite fun, but really hard pay-to-win game, so it destroys alot of play joy. Still fun to play though
340	1	a	many cheaters, dying community, and much money to pay
342	1	a	its a very good game 
344	1	a	A really fun F2P game, which plays alot like GTA and Saints Row in a Cop vs Crim scenario. It also has some of the most in depth customization in any game to date.
346	1	a	At first glance, APB Reloaded seemed stagnant and dry, like the barren tundra of a retired ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥'s once fertile ravine. The experience was shallow and the sense of accomplishment was too few and far between, leaving the uncertainty that a virgin feels after what may have been an instance of date ♥♥♥♥ ; could one even call that a victory at all?  Now, standing at the frontier of this outlaw's paradise, I find myself wondering : am I playing this game, or is this game playing me?
348	1	a	GTA meets the Sims (as far as character/vehicle customizations go). The has some age on it, but it never gets old driving around San Paro with your posse, doing drive-bys while blasting music from your car speakers. Go Enforcers!
350	1	a	just a 5 star action packed thirdperson shooter 
352	1	a	Very Fun game with others. Would recommend to play with a group of friends talking using skype,mumble etc.
354	1	a	APB is the one game ive played that ive had as much fun winning in, its rewarding, satisfying on so many levels. But its also one of the most frustrating and cheater filled games you'll find. But since they added the new anti-cheat system called 'Fairfight' its been a severe change amongst the opposition you face. Most of the time its good fun and great players, but at many points during missions you will encounter people that are questionable at best. Its widely known that cheaters still exist within APB Reloaded and it doesnt feel like the developers are actually taking it as seriously as some would want.  The game itself is based highly on the Ingame Marketplace that you spend real life cash in to procure lifetime bonuses such as weaponry, vehicles, clothing and the infamous 'Joker boxes' that personaly i bought over a 100 of, and never got any good loot from. Supposedly the boxes have a chance to drop legendary weapons such as the even more infamous 'OCA Nano' machine pistol. Its the most overpowered weapon in the game as its capable of literally wiping the floor with enemy opposition up too 100 meters(The maximum sight range ingame) even at full auto(LoL)   But even with the problems that exist in the game its still one of the few games ive spent over 1000 hours playing and still play from time to time. Like previously stated, you arnt likely to find a game that is as satisfying to win in as in APB.  If the gameplay doesnt do everything for you there is the most advanced character customization existing so far in any kind of MMO's out there, and you can spend hour after hour just modifying, adding tattoos, painting cars, and not actually doing anything else.  8/10
356	1	a	Really good game
358	1	a	pay2win ftw
360	1	a	many female avis with cat ears, much pervy men play as girls. 10/10 IGN
362	1	a	This is open world, fun, and enjoyable game. If you have played GTA series and like them, well this is the game for you. This type of video game is great at the moment but later i can see falling as being way to repetitive.
364	1	a	This is one of the most BS pay to win games I have played in a very long time. I mean 99% of the time you are going to get rolled by weeaboos that put like $100 into buying the best guns and perks... BUUUUUUT, the customization is SOOOOOOOOOOOO good that SOMEHOW the horrible, HORRIBLE, real money balance issues are made okay.
366	1	a	I recommend all third-person loving players to give this game a go and a couple of hours, it does take a while to get use to the game, but once you get started you really start to enjoy it, does have some connection problems but it's close to 0, and i have ran into a few hackers in the last couple of weeks, but the new 'FairFight' anti-hacker software works very well.
368	1	a	If you like games similar to GTA Vice City you will love this game. In my oppinion APB reloaded is like the Grand Theft Auto games (GTA3 and after) except it has what we've always wanted, Multiplayer. Customize your character and cars and unlock/upgrade your guns through a level/rank system. I think its a great game and recommend it.
370	1	a	This is a surprisingly enjoyable game. I don't enjoy competetive FPS games that much, but I like APB. For me, the ability to use non-lethal force and arrest criminals rather than always just kill them is a nice touch.
372	1	a	Best GTA like experience game. i was very impressed with this game.
374	1	a	Took only around 3000 hours of my life and above,still no regrats.Best game evur.
376	1	a	Ok. Couple times I abandon game cuz of ♥♥♥♥ing optimization of APB. It was awful. Now i tried to play it again, and confidently can say that game is OPTIMIZED WELL, it works well on my i3. I can see the creators work, the hard work definitely exist. Game is playable now for me, and same for mass of other people. Nice work GamersFirst! What can i say about the game? Its perfect. I love it.
378	1	a	This game is the best game I have ever played in all of my life. I recommend this for anyone who enjoys just shooting the ♥♥♥♥ out of people and having a great time. There is a lot of customization in this game, which lets you be anyone you want to.
380	1	a	This game has made me feel levels of anger previously unachieved by man. This game's players (read: hackers), however, created something truly glorious that my friends and I will never forget. It only happened once, and it has never truly occurred again ever since.  For the duration of one mission, I became the incarnation of screaming, wrath, and comedy. My rage was the rage of an infinite number of sweaty nerds. My unquellable anger extended beyond the deepest voids of the universe and all dimensions, and then it happened. I was happy. I had literally gotten so angry that I had looped back around to happy. But the wrath remained. And he had awakened. When he was a part of me, he was called NEGROCITY, THE RAGELORD. But as the mission ended, so too did our brief ascension to the next level of humanity. With our remaining wrath, he ascended to the next plane of existence, as was his destiny. Alone, he shed the name Negrocity, becoming simply The Ragelord. I chose to remain here among the world of men.  Godspeed, Ragelord. We'll never forget you.  'YES! YES!!! I ♥♥♥♥ING LOVE BULLETS!!!' -Negrocity, being shot in the chest   It's an alright game if you enjoy everlasting agony.
382	1	a	Yo. I'm a real thug freal ma negros, and this game just brought about bad memories. One time I was flying around in my direct replica of my own personal drug dealing van and i saw this kid. his name was masterrapist59xXZeldaFanXx and he wasn't joking about his name. His knowledge of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Zelda was out of this world. But then it hit me: my friend's car. It broke both ma legs and then he honked his horn at me for hours and hours, but I refused to leave, for I am the dominant male. Then I went and begged mhy mommy for money so I could get a permanent gun. She said 'YOOOOO CUT IT' and stabbed me in the stomach for the second time this week.
384	1	a	Free, fun and by far the BEST avatar customization in any game EVER.  The only issue is lack of Australian servers, which would be fine if the cars were not driven server-side, causing almost unplayable car-handling lag when driving. :(
386	1	a	It's a really good game if you are not facing a full team of P2W people. There should be seperate districts for people who pay for this game and they can't choose non P2W districts. 8/10
388	1	a	very good game and fun you can create your own man and disigne the car as you wish for amazing game
390	1	a	Very well made has alot of customizations of characters and vehicles i like the game in general but 1 underlieing issue i find is the unbalance of pvp where law enforcement players choose exactly when to start pvp putting the criminal in a state of unplayability because if you occupy your attention on something else the player will 'turn on pvp' at that exact moment and gun you down without you even knowing what is going on. Basically you CANT PVP as a criminal freely against law enfocement players you are under there control all the time. IDK why they dont just make the pvp always on for all players why cant a criminal roll up on a law enforcemrent player and shoot freely? it is very unbalanced game because of it and it forces the criminal player to not be able to enjoy the game at all if a law enforcement player decides to follow them around and make there gameing expierience unenjoyable when the whole point in playing a video game is to have fun its illogical to make a game where a player that chooses 1 side is automatically disatvantaged and has to try to play the game at the 100% control of another random player.
392	1	a	A pretty awesome game for those who want customization features a better GTA multi-player and still want a GTA like game-play
394	1	a	This game is pretty amazing. The driving is great, the pvp is great, and character customization is insane. The only downside is you have to wear headphones if you are in a house with others like me. I got kids and the game has no way to limit its MA rated language... and I mean it drops the F-bomb all the time. Dang joker ammo boxes!
396	1	a	this game is a very fun game to play even though the mission match making is not very good you can still have alot of fun on it.i would recomend it to people who do not get easily frustrated with bad matchmaking
398	1	a	very fun, its basically a f2p gta
400	1	a	its great its like gta but more epic FOR FREEEEEE
402	1	a	Its a great game! It has good graphics, good guns, and its an MMO! You can role with your friends or role solo you choose. Its truly amazing and its free! The custimization never stops you can make evrything you want perfectionaly! GET IT!
404	1	a	Pretty fun and addicting for a Free-To-Play game, once you get the hang of it.
406	1	a	If you take your time and get used to the world and weapons you will do fine. Sure this game has a few hackers but so what? If you actually have some common sense and skill you can still beat them. I love this game! T ~ T
408	1	a	If you like a RP environment and enjoy games like GTA or Saints Row you should definatlely consider giving this game a try. Its Free to play and also uses Last.FM for their music selection as well.
410	1	a	This Is A Nice Game I HAvent Played it
412	1	a	It takes your ♥♥♥♥♥♥s and ♥♥♥♥♥ on them until they're a nice diarrhea ♥♥♥♥♥ mash to eat at thanksgiving.
414	1	a	a very nice game, and you can collect and group conflict.
416	1	a	Its grown alot since the old days, play it with freinds.
418	1	a	Good lord, you need a computer the size of a small moon to properly play this. If you can play it without lag, I'd say it might be quite good.
420	1	a	GTA MMO with the most skill required from any game I've played and team tactics are a must. Customization is the best anywhere which makes every character unique.
422	1	a	This game is e amazing played this game 3 years ago and now rejoining once again missed APB
424	1	a	another great game destroyed by hackers
426	1	a	It's really fun. ( if you have friends and you are rich )
428	1	a	This game is horribly made. Its full of glitches its definatly pay-to-win; and is extremely complicated to understand out the gate. BUT never have I played a game were i have laughed harder or had more fun playing. If you have freinds to play this game DO IT you wont regret it. This game has led to me crying from laughter more then this game. Great for tons of antics and slamming into people in cars. That is why i recommend it.
430	1	a	I have some time on this game and its pretty fun and intense. I would recommend it to a person that likes GTA franchise. The only bad part is the engine. Its horribly optimized
432	1	a	This game rocks!
434	1	a	Very good game, hours of fun I deeply recommend tring this game but warning You'll be hooked ;)
436	1	a	Great game and all. Well rounded missions and beautiful map design as well as character creation. However, the game could greatly benefit from locational damage, making shotguns and sniper rifles more fun. Still a fun game with a mildly pleasant community.
438	1	a	One of a kind of game.
440	1	a	the best free roam gaem in the worlds, better than gta 5 becuse its fr3e but its pay to win, so its very hard to beat those people who try very hard and have to send money on a free game. lmfao they need to get a life because who pays for a free game. are u kiddin me its so expensive too like 400g1c fo 10 bucks, my muda♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ i could get a nice lunch with that mony. but i actually like this game very much besides the fact tht there are some muda cheaters that need to die. gta 5 has like upgrades that you can unlock for vechicles but this game requires you to purchase it so im like dis ♥♥♥♥♥. i have a ♥♥♥♥ car someone please donate to me for charity pls. i have like no guns someone donate that too. i like the missions in the game because its very easy to shoot some crims or enforcers up. so fun and easy must play guranteed you will get addicted to this and play all day and pay gmaersfirst money to win and you can wrek all the nubs.sometimes theres redeem codes that are sick becuse i dont have to spend mony on the game to win. but then again other people can use the same free redeem codse and they can win too so its gg over. i rate this a 10/10 because its well doenbut it lags on my fast laptop that i use to play minecraft and ♥♥♥♥. 20fpps is easiely playable just like the console 24fps like honeslty why ned more than 20fps lmfao. i hate the hackusators in the game when i destroy them, they just whine about you have wall hacks or aim hacks idc get banned kid, go outside play ball or some ♥♥♥♥. im like ♥♥♥♥ you do the same but suck and whine. why dont you go outside and not suck ♥♥♥♥ at a game and blame it on people -thanks by the lord and savier shinobu soccer man
442	1	a	Thumbs up because of the customization range, but in all honesty, I couldn't care less about the actual gameplay. Customization is the only aspect of this game that's keeping me hooked. 90% of my time is spent in the Social District making themes, or customizing my look. Subsequently, I only do missions to unlock symbols, clothing, and cars so I can design my own stuff simply because I enjoy it. But unfortunately you have to pay to REALLY express yourself in the symbol editor, as Premium users are allowed 50 layers, while Non-Premium players are only allowed 3. Also, a heads up: the majority of this community is garbage. I'm not going into detail (to spare you a wall of text), but decent players in this game are a minority. And by decent, I mean in terms of skill and morality. So ultimately, if you like a large range of cutomization, then this is the game for you.
444	1	a	ITS A GREAT GAME I RECOMMENT STARTING AS A CRIM BECOUSE THERE ALOT OF BENIFT FOR NEW PLAYERS AND IT HELPS YOU TO GET BETTER THINGS TO DO WHEN YOUR READY TRY A ENFORCER THERE HARD BECOUSE THE GUNS AND HOW YOU GET MONEY ITS A FUN GAME IF YOU WANT TO KILL TIME OR HAVE NOTHING TO DO THERES LITTLE HACKERS NOT MUCH AS IT USE TO BE I RECCOMMEND THIS GAME 
446	1	a	The game in its own right is good, it is different and fun but there are so many features that kill it for me e.g: poor optimisation.  6/10
448	1	a	Best Game of the Genre!
450	1	a	Well the game is preaty much a lot of fun.....until you see all the hackers and too good people to play against...
452	1	a	GTA V for pc but better... and it's free :D
454	1	a	BEST GAME FTW   i like this game a lot playing it no life because i cant stop. i have to many fun in this game   only thing is steam acthviements or something like that doesn't work for me so i got only one its glitch but np   I RECOMMEND THIS GAME
456	1	a	Oh my. APB Reloaded.  This game has a learning curve unlike most other in the FPS genre. There will be blood, sweat and tears in your first 30 hours of playing, from getting nuked to orbit by OSMAW noobs and continously ramming your sweet Charge Cisco into a wall every time you try to make a turn at a somewhat decent speed.  But once you get a hang of the games mechanics, and learn to snipe even the kids with their parents credit cards, this game gets really fun.  Because you've been through it yourself, you can almost feel the frustration of the enemy, when you go 20/0 in a 3v3 capture mission, wrecking them everytime they try to make a play.  This game takes commitment. You have to put in a good amount of time, to get even somewhat decent at the game, and everytime you think you matter, another challenger comes along, and puts you right back where you belong.   I love it.
458	1	a	fashion police vs fashion thugs  10/10
460	1	a	10 outa 10.   Has a Hatsune Miku Pantsu Van. Quality Game for Quality Gamers.
462	1	a	I love the game it's really fun but the matchmaking.. cheaters everywhere,griefers, annoying ppl but this game can be really fun playing without anyone or with someone. Everyone hates eachother in apb.. team vs team, crims vs cops .. just everyone :P
464	1	a	This Game Is Awesome
466	1	a	APB Reloaded IS A GRAET GAME
468	1	a	PLEASE HELP ME MY GAME SHOWS THE SPLASH SCREEN THEN IT GOS AWAY AND DOESNT RUN!PLEASE HELP ME!
470	1	a	I have played APB:Reloaded for 4 years total with 2920 hours in game (i dont use steam a whole ton hence ~1k hours.) Great game, great customization. Completely free to play, there is 0 PTW at all. Premium only gives benefits to customization, and aftermatch bonuses. Everything on ARMAS is reskins, early progression, weapon skins, and clothing and vehicle kits. Weapons are well balanced within their niches. Its a little difficult to get a handle on when starting, but find some friends, join a clan, and it becomes a lot better! It has significantly gotten better with the implementation of FairFight (Don't believe most of the claims in chat that someone is 'cheating', most times they actually aren't), and seems that it will only get better.  I recommend this game to players who wish to challenge themselves, can easily learn from their mistakes, and learn from their enemies. As well as players who enjoy customizing their characters, as it has some of the best customization options I have seen in a game so far.  Game also uses a bit of Ram 8gb will do just fine, anything less will probably get frustrating.  See you in San Paro!
472	1	a	i really njoy playing this game, its so fun, good graphics, good gameplay, and its free...
474	1	a	this game is amazing but my game crashes every 10 mins but thats not for eveyone
476	1	a	An open criminal-cop world were Driving is a pain in the @$$ and paid players are at the top of the food chain.
478	1	a	cute waifus are the only redeeming quality. solid 4.5/10
480	1	a	love the game i play it on xbox one  
482	1	a	Love this game, this game is fantastic :p
484	1	a	It's ok i guess.
486	1	a	Time for an actual review. So basicly you set out on a quest to get large ammounts of hats. Along the way you shoot tons of fat russians, Ex-Nazis, Stereo-Typical americans and black people. Also you collect over powered weapons to make a disguise to make it a 'First Person Shooter' when it's really a hat simulator. Defiently worth 20$... OH ♥♥♥♥ IT'S FREE BUT YOU GET LESS HATS!!! THIS CAN NOT GO UNNOTICED! PLEASE VALVE FIX THIS AT ONCE! Anyway there are 9 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s to play as. If you like to spend countless ammount of money on a shining hat this is the game for you!    -Picky  P.S. Give me hats.    Woops wrong game
488	1	a	Since its been a while i played this game i decided to give it a look again when fairfight got released. I found the game more enjoyable since the amount of cheaters had been halved meaning less bs like that, sadly there was no real new things to the game except the R255 what i was done with quite quickly. So for a f2p its actually a good game where you can put plenty of time into and have fun in with friends but i would not recommend buying things like weapons on the armas marketplace since you are just wasting your money, altough premium is a good thing to buy.   I will give this game a 6,5/10 so Yes i would recommend it
490	1	a	over 1700h now and still the most awesome game ever:P
492	1	a	it has a few bugs but it is ok if the bugs get fixed and they add were u can join gangs this game would be awesome 
494	1	a	its good
496	1	a	New as of 7/23/14!   Tired of dirty hackers having fun at your expense? FairFight is here to change the game: FairFight evens the score to let you play fairly with the satisfaction of seeing the real bad guys banned and publicly shamed for your amusement. With bleeding edge technology that sets it apart from traditional anti-cheats, FairFight works constantly to detect and weed out even the most evasive cheaters from APB.   Play Fair  Feel secure in knowing that FairFight actively monitors your opposition in every mission you play, in every district and every server.   Hackers Publicly Shamed  Enjoy the satisfaction of watching FairFight publicly broadcast each unsuspecting hacker it bans, in real-time.   Bleeding Edge  FairFight employs advanced algorithmic analysis and cheat detection methods far beyond the capabilities of other solutions. Its server-side approach means that it can never truly be bypassed by hack programs.
498	1	a	One off my favorite games..  +great graphics  -Hackers -Smurfs yes thats a thingh -Overpowered weps  8/10 
500	1	a	Still funny after 5 years gaming
502	1	a	Ignore the negative reviews out there for this game. It is one of the more impressive, especially free-to-play games I have seen in the last year or so.   First of all:  The Customization   --  For starters, you have an emblem editor. It's FREE. You can compose, import and edit soundtracks varying from different genres - ranging from 8-bit to even Rock N' Roll style- point is, you can make pretty much whatever you please with it. Yes, it is FREE and YES you can use it as a soundtrack for your vehicle. Your vehicle can be customized too, using the emblem editor and such. Character-customization itself isn't the best around as you may already know, but it still offers a spiff amount of variety. Be creative.    Second:  The Gameplay   --  The missions/quests recommended to you are often really simple. Go fetch this, steal that (depending on whether you're a cop/criminal) and return back to a particular area. As an enforcer, it's up to you to take care of this city; patrol as cars pass by, or head straight into action by stopping a robbery held up by the opposition. There are different 'events' from time-to-time that random players may join for a little extra AND your extra, though this isn't required. Not to mention that individual tasks can become very repetitive. This is why I recommend joining up with some friends to roam around the city or roll up against other players.    Third:  The Graphics   --  They say that the first thing you notice in a game is it's graphics. It's engine. The visual elements of the game. Normally I don't judge a game by the way it looks. Instead, I tend to lay my eyes closer on the smaller details. APB: Reloaded offers some support for lower-ended PCs, but obviously to a degree. Though not up-to-par compared to most shooters today, you will most likely be focusing on just how fun it is to play.    Fourth:  Customer Service   --  Typically you can come across complaints prior to a company's customer support or service. As of now, I have yet to run into issues with this. Given some research, they seem to offer some technical support for accounts and other game-related problems. You can always email the developers for support too. For me personally, this isn't something I would complain about. But it should be looked into.   My rating for this game is a 7/10 - it is easily a SOLID third-person shooter, rich with a large variety of customization and design. Though as many may say, it isn't perfect and has many noticable flaws as a F2P game. Almost four years ago after 2009, this franchise could have ceased to exist. Most games don't get second chances even after development is delayed. This one can surely become better considering how much potential it has.
504	1	a	im sure its fun..but i cant work out how to play it. (im just crap at it)
506	1	a	Very easy to get in. I once got on a map where a little kid was thinking he was talking over the mic After telling him to calm down. He began to tell me to get on mic. later someone used mic and acted like me lol
508	1	a	Best cat girl simulator on the market.
510	1	a	managed to kill gold rank while im silver get insulted as a hacker managed to kill R255 as a low level get insulted as a hacker dies 2 time gets insulted for not playing properly  10/10 would get insulted again
512	1	a	Some people might say this game is like GTA or other killing games,but no..This game is much different,First of all its more tactical and by that I mean,When you're an enforcer,you can only kill people,or taze them when they actually do a crime(smash on shop posters and get suitcases etc) But sometimes it bugs out and suddently the person does not have the money,maybe its not the bug but I have no Idea.. Another thing,the mission system is pretty good,If its un-even you can call for backup.But sometimes if EVERYONE is in a match,You might be un-even untill the 4th or 5th round where you actually get backup because someone joined or a match ended x3 So thoose were the things that I liked about the gameplay,Im now going to talk about the p2w element. This game is actually a pretty fair p2w element,You can buy guns on ARMAS Marketplace,or..Just wait untill you unlock a  version of it,Obviously you can't unlock thoose rare weapons but there are weapons that are based on them,Also there are coupons you can use for free premium and some clothing etc. Guns n' stuff x3    Anyways that was my review of this game.Its a good mmorpg(Kind of xd) Cya! &lt;3
514	1	a	action packed, full of awesome fun. worth playing. it's alot like GTA, but lacks certain aspects such as being able to enter water, go into alot of buildings(still many to access but not quite as many), and a great player base even though most hang out in the social district.   cons: aimbots, can end up with players with stronger guns going against you on missions, servers are sometimes glitchy(you move so far then get dragged back into a previous place)  i reccommend this game for anyone 13+(course it would be anyways) so long as they don't mind blood,guns, fast cars, fast women(jk), crude humor, heavy language, and being a bit bullied by the opposition.  the only problem i found with it is server lag because of how much is run on the server itself, and the launcher is buggy sometimes. i haven't figured out why my launcher quit working..but i am in the process of fixing it i hope.will update review when fixed.
516	1	a	one of the best games i have played this game has so much customization i can play this game for ever also this game ruined my life im so adicted to this game
518	1	a	Me Mike Wazoski Recommends this game to nice and intelliengient people!
520	1	a	Great game its free to play but not pay to win... ofcourse its more fun to play as premium, but its very playable as free to play aswell, with a bit of practice you can dominate with the free to play weapons and it just takes longer to unlock stuff in free to play... but its do-able.  the customization is the best i've ever seen in any game, so if you're creative like me you will love this game!  all around it could be a bit more optimised but they are working on an engine update to release early 2014...  Give it a shot! you have nothing to lose
522	1	a	If you have a decent computer and your looking for a shooter with its own feel from any other, this is the game is great. The amount of customization is insane.
524	1	a	Nice game, however totally unplayable with all the aimbots and cheaters. First game i actually stopped playing because of it.
526	1	a	Its ok in the beginning but gets old after 10 hours of play..
528	1	a	Decent FPS MMO... Amazing character and vehicle cuztomization. Only problem this game has is that there is no tutorial and Pro players play in noobie districts and kick noobs' asses This is one of my favourite MMOs  Read full review here:  gawkingeeks.com/apbreloaded 
530	1	a	I had a really hard time falling in love with this game. I really wanted to like it because I love the bad guys vs good guys realistic 'GTA' feel to it. I played for a few hours my first time and left mad and frustrated. There were simply too many great players to go up against and I felt lost. I tried several more times and I just kept at it hoping I would find what I was looking for in the game and I did finally find it, although it took well over 50 hours before I started falling in love. Don't get me wrong, the game has a special way with people and even people who have gotten fairly good or great still rage quit. It has it's ways of making one oh so mad at times. But it is really worth it, the good things are far more than the bad.   I see so many reviews on this game from players with under 10 hours let alone 50. Some reviews as little as 1.2 hours played, really? This game is so very very hard on the noob. You will most surely find yourself going against players with hundreds of hours of game time within your first day of play if you are even remotely good and can aquire a few kills here and there. This being said though you have to keep in mind you're just cutting your teeth and things will get better.  I highly recommend this game to what I would call mid to high hardcore gamers. If you go in knowing it's going to be rough at first but you're in it for the long haul and want to put in your time so you can get to the good stuff this game is for you. I do not recommend this game to casual gamers. You will most likely leave mad and write a review after 1.2 hours of gameplay.  If you are going to try this great game I recommend watching a lot of videos on Youtube and just general reseach on the net. Do some reading on gameplay before you step out there, you'll be glad you did. This is an awesome game but it does take quite a few hours before you'll probably say to yourself 'man, this game rocks'!
532	1	a	Great gane definatly a game all steam users must have
534	1	a	best game ever, it's free play it
536	1	a	it is real good
538	1	a	2 Teams - The Enforcers: they try to stop the criminals commiting crime  The Criminals: they try to commit crimes  Basically: you run around a city wielding guns GTA style and wrecklessly drive through shop windows like a boss  11/10
540	1	a	Laggy game, laggy as hell but you gonna be possessed by it very soon
542	1	a	Free to play gta 5 online :D
544	1	a	APB: Reloaded is a really good, and in my opinion, a well thought out game for the style it revolves around. I personally loved the customization of the character creation, as well as for the vehicles. I won't lie and say I enjoyed the game to the fullest, but it was on my side, for the sole fact that I'm not on a gaming rig, but even through the lag I had while playing this game, I did enjoy it. The community isn't THEE best, but there are some friendly faces in-game, and in all honesty, this game doesn't require much 'skill' to be good, I personally think it mainly depends on how good or bad of a system you have, in order handle being able to fight back when in a competative scenerio. Over all though, the game was fun, I just recommend you have decent specs before playing, because you won't get the best gaming experience otherwise.
546	1	a	Great game. Accidentally played it more than GMod.
548	1	a	
550	1	a	Fun game to play solo. If you can find a group to do it with it's up there as one of my favorite shooters.. It's not a GTA MMO, more like cops and robbers-- strictly PVP. The weapons are versatile, the scenery is beautiful and the customization is unmatched. A word of advice though-- do not buy any weapon with real money. It's not worth it. Buying clothes, sure? Buying weapons doesn't give you a real leg up, and they're all over priced and normally only last a few days. I get why they have a rental system from a marketing standpoint. It's just kind of bull. The driving is fun too....so so fun. The learning curve isn't steep, and generally they do a good job of keeping the bronze and gold players apart.
552	1	a	This gaming is extremely fun even if the novelty may wear off quickly. It is at least worth a try since it is free. I still plan on playing ever so often given the right mood.
554	1	a	Seriously probably my favorite game on Steam right now. The game world is insanely fleshed out, with literally paragraphs of text about every imaginable part of the city. The city really feels alive, with people walking around and the dynamic of other players that you see everywhere lending to the feeling of really being in San Paro, and as an Enforcer, really wanting to protect the city. The combat is awesome, and is literally the favorite of any shooter I have played. The third person view makes for some intense fights, with vantage points, corners and a well balanced team helping out immensly, and making acting as a team extremely important. The community is rich, vibrant and involved, with many members making amazing customs designs for vehicles and contributing to the game culture and story by customizing themselves and their cars with really intricate, professional-looking and amazing designs. The cars and guns are all very unique and cater to many different play styles, with an LMG feeling very different and using a much different strategy than shotguns, and having one of each is extremely handy. Character modifications also help, with each strengthening the specializations you can have, but are not necessary to winning or to playing, as both the starting gun and car are actually good enough that you don't need to buy the next tiers if you don't want (many high-tier players still use the Star (the first gun) later in the game). Yet each new car and gun feels very cool, and are great incentives for increasing levels. Each new contact has a unique backstory, and the new items are actually exciting, as some of the coolest cars and guns can be a lot of fun to unlock and use for the first time, and each new (and more prestigious) contact that you couldn't talk to before seem cool and exciting, and makes the sense of progression extremely satisfying. The whole game can be played without buying anything with real money or having premium, and the game is nowhere close to a pay to win, with each gun and car always being balanced by another, and almost all can be purchased with in-game cash in a very reasonable amount. The game is very, very fair, and paying money is usually just for cool stuff that could be unlocked anyways, with the aesthetic value serving as the impetus, not the over-poweredness. Almost all can be unlocked in game, and the higher-tier premium players are indistinguishable from those that are free to play, as both have the same benefits for the most part and most of the elite items are unlocked with high-level contacts. Everything about this game is solid, well thought out and rich in both depth, story, and game feel, and the controls of driving and shooting are seamlessly integrated into what is my favorite game of all time. I've had hundreds of hours just having fun with friends, driving around the streets of San Paro having a blast racing, shooting and delving deeper into the amazing world Reloaded Studios has created. This game is amazing, and I love it. I can only give it the highest possible recommendation. If you're thinking about getting it, get it. If you're not, still do. This is the most solid game I have ever played, and is also the most fun. I love APB :D
556	1	a	There once was a dream called APB. Real Time Worlds spent over 10 million to see that dream come true. With their wonderful additions like a half finished game, horrible optimization that kills even top end computers in the future, incompetent management that spends way to much money, and a sad excuse for advertising by paying some idiot to get tattooed and dress like a character from the game. Really? Thats the best you could come up with?  After this dream died, it was picked up by Gamers First. G1 has done everything they can to honor this game by ruining it more and more with every patch. It was actually fun during closed beta and looked like we may be getting the good version of APB again. How wrong we were... we should have known that the black guy in the gold bikini was an ill omen to G1s inability to optimize and improve the game.  If you do play this, never leave the social district. You won't be missing anything by skipping the shooter part of this game. Experience the best character, clothing, and emblem editor ever to grace a game.
558	1	a	it just ♥♥♥♥ing pwnedge
560	1	a	Pretty good game. Got really good at the game and got into gold lobbies(don't do that's bad) anything above bronze rank lobby is full of hackers. Can't display clan name unless your vip. Made a car with a picture of boobs on it. 10/10   I Should say that I know this game is TERRIBLE. But I will say I had fun in it.
562	1	a	Well the game is preaty much a lot of fun.....until you see all the hackers and too good people to play against...
564	1	a	10/10 would ♥♥♥♥ cats for a living.
566	1	a	This is a good game most the time, sometimes there will be hackers but that's the inevidable in online games. It has level's to unlock to earn new guns. People will say this is a p2w game, however I haven't spent a single penny, and I enjoyed it more then I probably should have. :)
568	1	a	MEDIOCRE GAME BUT IT GIVES YOU FREEDOM WHICH CAUSES ANARCHY ♥♥♥♥ THE POLICE. 6.66/10
570	1	a	very fun and extremely addicting!
572	1	a	This game is pretty amazing. The driving is great, the pvp is great, and character customization is insane. The only downside is you have to wear headphones if you are in a house with others like me. I got kids and the game has no way to limit its MA rated language... and I mean it drops the F-bomb all the time. Dang joker ammo boxes!
574	1	a	Cool.
576	1	a	Amazing game.  This game is like the old version of saints row 2 meets GTA Online and a whole ♥♥♥♥ton of crack (and stealing)
578	1	a	this game blow weener DO NOT BUY wow ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ non advertisidad
580	1	a	Sick game love it.
582	1	a	APB, ever since day one I have enjoyed playing and customising. The only thing is sometimes hackers can ruin a game.
584	1	a	A really fun F2P game, which plays alot like GTA and Saints Row in a Cop vs Crim scenario. It also has some of the most in depth customization in any game to date.
586	1	a	This is a great game. I should know. I have spent over 2800 hours of my life in this game. Wasted? No. This was well worth it. There are so many dynamics at play here that you cant experience it all in just 1 week of gaming.  Live the action hero you always wanted to be. Drive over people. Shoot people. Blow people up. All of that and more can be done here in vivid detail with an awesome soundtrack to boot!  Are there haxors? Like every game, there will be those who cant play fair. Simply report and keep on playing. I always do. Dont let them ruin your fun. There are ususally 4 different action districts to game in and several different achievements and missions you could be doing at any given time. Give it a try!
588	1	a	many cheaters, dying community, and much money to pay
590	1	a	Your review cannot be empty
592	1	a	Good but P2P
594	1	a	*-*
596	1	a	.
598	1	a	ITS A GREAT GAME I RECOMMENT STARTING AS A CRIM BECOUSE THERE ALOT OF BENIFT FOR NEW PLAYERS AND IT HELPS YOU TO GET BETTER THINGS TO DO WHEN YOUR READY TRY A ENFORCER THERE HARD BECOUSE THE GUNS AND HOW YOU GET MONEY ITS A FUN GAME IF YOU WANT TO KILL TIME OR HAVE NOTHING TO DO THERES LITTLE HACKERS NOT MUCH AS IT USE TO BE I RECCOMMEND THIS GAME 
600	1	a	Is a fun game if you like Fps..   :3
602	1	a	pretty much pay2win but can be a laugh with friends
604	1	a	Though it's no Grand Theft Online, this game is worth playing for the character designer and the decal tools alone. Also, the Electronic Beat station is the best soundtrack of any game except Brütal Legend. The problem with APB is that it takes too many bullets to drop an enemy, and the missions devolve into an impenetrable defense. In order to do well at this game you have to know where these hideouts are, and be the first to get there, which means playing like a lamer. Bring some friends.
606	1	a	Great game for senseless violense playing as cops or crooks :D
608	1	a	This game is soo cool!! Looks like a GTA game and it's also for free!! +You can drift,no cracking,damageshown -It's kinnda Pay2win But it's still cool!!!! The teaming is good for earning money!
610	1	a	Really addicting. Its like GTA and Cops and Robbors just had a baby.
612	1	a	Very fun game,especially if you're in a clan of cool people.It has some cons though: -Servers usually lagging -Some hackers -Really hard to get into especially if you're alone,it is NOT an easy game  But it has lots of cool features: -Big maps with detailed environnements and a feeling of living city (with players+npcs) -A looooot of weapons you can get -Not p2w at all,you can beat a premium or legendary gun user with a free gun -A quite good community (of course there are some idiots but its a minority)ready to help most of the time  YES,i recommend this game,if you're ready to get into,do it,its free! :)
614	1	a	Time for an actual review. So basicly you set out on a quest to get large ammounts of hats. Along the way you shoot tons of fat russians, Ex-Nazis, Stereo-Typical americans and black people. Also you collect over powered weapons to make a disguise to make it a 'First Person Shooter' when it's really a hat simulator. Defiently worth 20$... OH ♥♥♥♥ IT'S FREE BUT YOU GET LESS HATS!!! THIS CAN NOT GO UNNOTICED! PLEASE VALVE FIX THIS AT ONCE! Anyway there are 9 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s to play as. If you like to spend countless ammount of money on a shining hat this is the game for you!    -Picky  P.S. Give me hats.    Woops wrong game
616	1	a	it has a few bugs but it is ok if the bugs get fixed and they add were u can join gangs this game would be awesome 
618	1	a	This is still one of my favorit games on my Steam library and it is full of fun things to do (aside from the lag). you can customize allmost anything in the game and there is a large amount of guns and cars to use in game. Also there is a back story to the game (no one really reads anyways :/) but I have and it is not that bad, I say this game is a must get for the roll playing shooter type of people that like to customize alot.
620	1	a	DUMP TRUCKS FOR THE WIN
622	1	a	This game is e amazing played this game 3 years ago and now rejoining once again missed APB
624	1	a	It may be a ♥♥♥♥♥ some times but when it works it rocks! i love the game because of its beauty and potential. some people see a trash game without any good things in it. i see a unfinished game that can turn into a awesome game! may be kind of a pay to win game but that just means you gotta upgrade yo skillz!
626	1	a	Get this game
628	1	a	Best Game of the Genre!
630	1	a	This game is really fun and keeps me wanting to come back and play after months! That's what my friend told me, I wouldn't know though because I can't run it.
632	1	a	I love this game, it reminds me a lot of the Saints Row games. If you like pvp and shooters I would recommend this one. I'm still VERY new to this game, I'm learning the basics at the moment but I play this game a lot. Its tons of fun!
634	1	a	This game is soo cool!! Looks like a GTA game and it's also for free!! +You can drift,no cracking,damageshown -It's kinnda Pay2win But it's still cool!!!! The teaming is good for earning money!
636	1	a	BEST GAME EVER! love it love it love it! both customization, fighting. everything 
638	1	a	It's where you become a sexy hot Hooker with a gun and you can give people virtual ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and jack people off then taze people in the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ until they give you virtual money then become a Mexican drug dealer and drive your car off a building while masturbating to your character or be a citizen and constantly get rammed, ♥♥♥♥♥,robbed,♥♥♥♥♥♥ off, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ON, and murdered  (This was copied from the scrub lord mark)
640	1	a	IF you're willing to deal with the bugs, the lag, and the hackers, THEN this is decent free-to-play version of multiplayer cops and robbers.  Until the servers are upgraded, and the serve-side FPS and other such issues are completely ironed out, it will always be a slightly enjoyable, rage-building experience.
642	1	a	this game blow weener DO NOT BUY wow ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ non advertisidad
644	1	a	Sick game love it.
646	1	a	*-*
648	1	a	I miss my group though... Great game
650	1	a	Best game ever i played with friend
652	1	a	It got me hyped...  For 10 sec...  But i enjoyed every second of it ;)
654	1	a	Not a bad game.  Suitable for non hardcore gamer that searching for fun. Do not join HAN server becoz itz dead af. Fought hacker? Uninstall.
656	1	a	Great game to play if you love the concept of cops and robbers its a hole lot funner when playing with freinds! i recomend any one to play. the gameplay is very similar to mass effect.
658	1	a	Fun Game. Needs to be more like GTA. Nuf said.
660	1	a	ruined by hackers, basically silkroad2.0 
662	1	a	You can travel around almost the whole map like an actually city. Picking either to buy a car suv or van is great, but the pledges to unlock them are a bit anonying. Costly too. Depending on your rank, the unlock and if it is a premade weapon it can be a lot if you're not a premium member. customization is extremely limited for free, but it has just enough to make something cool out of it. driving is pretty fun, the missions is fun, new modes seem interesting, overall i think this is a pretty great and fun game. espically with friends
664	1	a	Really addicting. Its like GTA and Cops and Robbors just had a baby.
666	1	a	it was gta 5 online for a long time then gta 5 online came out
668	1	a	This game rocks!
670	1	a	A very cool game. It has some bugs but it is much better than it was before.
672	1	a	This game has its ups and downs. I would recommend this game for someone who enjoys customizing their character, and just having a good time with friends. If you rage easily, maybe try a different game, as you die a LOT in this game. It's gonna happen, but I enjoy it even if I lose.   I approve.  -Charlie Scene
674	1	a	A great game I thoroughly enjoyed playing with both friends and others. good questing system (in my opinion) and a great sense of danger when you are on your own. Enjoy guys. 
676	1	a	Well the game is preaty much a lot of fun.....until you see all the hackers and too good people to play against...
678	1	a	This Game Is Awesome
680	1	a	If you play this all day.....you need a live man!    PS:add me and i will play with you! XD  I need a live too. :/
682	1	a	The game in its own right is good, it is different and fun but there are so many features that kill it for me e.g: poor optimisation.  6/10
684	1	a	Very nice game ;D
686	1	a	( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
688	1	a	Best Game of the Genre!
690	1	a	This is a good game most the time, sometimes there will be hackers but that's the inevidable in online games. It has level's to unlock to earn new guns. People will say this is a p2w game, however I haven't spent a single penny, and I enjoyed it more then I probably should have. :)
692	1	a	Well, the game pretty good it's been updated a lot. But my friend lost about $300 on the game. And it's pretty ♥♥♥♥ when trading..
694	1	a	The customization is immense in this game, however you can't really do much in the editors until you put your life at risk. I'm not a massive fan of PVP
696	1	a	so what do I think about this game? hmm... I want to make this as simple as possible and to put it all into 1 word, it would be... AWESOME!
698	1	a	TeamSpeak, Friends, and 'A' good Clan makes this game worth playing.
700	1	a	abp in a nut shell guy gets tomey gun then kills you 20 times then you buy a tomey gun you pown all with it
702	1	a	theres a thing wrong with mine the graphics is not realestic 
704	1	a	You should get this game! That is all...
706	1	a	9/10 My country is not suitable for the servers too laggy.   Good: 1.Gameplay 2.Graphics 3.Addictive 4.Being a psychopath cop  Bad: 1.PREMIUM FREAKING PLAYERS 2.Not suitable for my country's internet  (WOULD PLAY AGAIN)
708	1	a	Hmmm. It's a Solid game. However... there a couple of things that disturb me. For instance, high level players on a certain level get access to what we would call a Rocket Launcher. And this gives them godly powers. If you have to battle against a high level like that you're doomed. Its so overpowered. Some weapons are overpowered aswell, it's not like really balanced.   However, im glad this game is not Pay2Win, you can pay for extra options like cars and stuff but its really like a short cut. If you play long enough you will get access to that gear aswell sooner or later.   Finally i want to mention how wonderful the customization is though. I wish more games had such awesome custonization. Because, you can customize all your clothes, guns, cars, tag and much, much more!  UPDATE [24-05-2013] APB is the Most Hateful community i know on the internet. You can't go around, playing, for 1 hour without getting called extremely bad names, cussing, rage or false accusations.   On top of that its full of cheaters with aimbots and wallhacks. Reloaded Productions however doesn't make ANY effort to punish these people. And the updates they are bringing lately are Sad, repetitive and overpriced. ♥♥♥♥ you APB!
710	1	a	I hope you like deathmatch, because it doesn't get better thanb that (Not that great.). 10/10 it's OK.
712	1	a	Remember playing cops and robbers as a kid?... Yup, enough said.
714	1	a	i really njoy playing this game, its so fun, good graphics, good gameplay, and its free...
716	1	a	After over 1k hours spent into this game, I would say..  Pros: Open world One of the best free to play games Multiple servers for different locations around the world Mostly fast paced missions instead of something that goes on for hours Customisable loadouts, vehicles, clothing  Cons: Not fps friendly to low end computers Not very newbie friendly 9/10 of the new contents costs USD instead of in game money GamersFirst support system takes a while to reply
718	1	a	this game is amazing but my game crashes every 10 mins but thats not for eveyone
720	1	a	At only 137$ with discount this game is the fairest priced ripoff out there! I havent played it, but thats way too much to have to spend no a game from 2011
722	1	a	... 
724	1	a	Pretty fun game. It's basically like GTA and Saints Row, but with a more focus on missions than free roaming. Also the customization is so massive that it's almost overwhelming.  The only downside I have noticed is the lag even on the low ping servers. It isn't that noticeable while on foot, but it is really noticeable while driving. It is still worth checking out despite the lag that occurs.
726	1	a	the game is a fairly well made game, its being updated all the time, which is nice to an to a degree, sometimes you will be in the middle of playing and you will get a warning saying 'server shut down in 10 minutes' its quite annoying, although this is rare, it will happen to you. This is a grinding sort of game it can be really annoying, ive been playing for about six months and im only rank 128, max rank is 255... there is also many hackers in this game, moslty in American servers. (joker) how ever the Hong Kong server is very good about keeping it clean. (han) anyways, hope this helps, want more info? look for my cannel @ XenonGaming or follow me on twitter!!!
728	1	a	so what do I think about this game? hmm... I want to make this as simple as possible and to put it all into 1 word, it would be... AWESOME!
730	1	a	come play that massive multiplayer online game with alot of jerks 
732	1	a	This game is Like GTA and Saint's Row it's a lot of fun if you like SR or GTA then you will Love APB i Recomment downloading this game and trying it out after all it is Free
734	1	a	This is a must! The best action mmo game i've ever tryed. Try it! :D You can fully customize your player and vehicle etc.. Of course there is some bugs and annoying players. But it's a great game! Try it. i've spend many hours on this! :p

738	1	a	Very VERY fun game, the graphics are fine, the gameplay is awesome, but the only thing that could be changed is it size. It's kinda large and takes up alot of space on my computer, but its still awesome!
740	1	a	this game is amazing but my game crashes every 10 mins but thats not for eveyone
742	1	a	Over 400 hours on the Original APB from RealTimeWorlds, Was great fun with friends, fresh and amazing, one of the best games i've ever played, hower, APB Reloaded suffers from a PAY 2 WIN mechanic, free to players are at a disadvantage compared to players with purchased gear.  Also, Renting guns? One of my most hated features in any F2P  Fun, But very grindy and repetitive..
744	1	a	The game is ok but it takes forever to load up, I actually thought it crashed the first time. Hackers in the game are a big issue here and the devs dont seem to care anymore about it. The gameplay is like crackdown and gta combined but the controls arent that good. I give it 6/10 needs some care and attention but since it's F2P now I doubt it will get it.
746	1	a	After over 1k hours spent into this game, I would say..

750	1	a	Never played it. 11/10
752	1	a	great F2P game, its basically a Free version of Grand Theft Auto, if you have no money and you want to play an open world fun Gangsta game, get this!
754	1	a	This game is sooo close to what i can find an open world, trird person shooter, car jacking, and most of all custimization gotta love that. This game is clsoe to me having gta V, so what am i gonna do?  -Download  -think of the things i can do while it downloads  -when finsihes get hyped  -and play
756	1	a	Spend 2 hours + downloading the game. Spend 30 minutes updating the game. Spend 20 minutes waiting for the game to start. Cry soflty in pillow because game will not load. Reupdate the game for about 40 minuates
758	1	a	Great concept, STEEP learning curve! It's got great potential! 
760	1	a	Its a Really good game when you put the time in and give it a shot.
762	1	a	I LOVE THIS GAME!
764	1	a	 I would like to start by saying that APB Reloaded is not a great game for everyone.    It requires patience in order to enjoy it, so I would not recommend it for seriously competitive gamers.   With that said, APB Reloaded is probably my favorite long-standing game. As of writing this, I have played for well over 500 hours, over the course of a few years.    What's it like?   APB can sort of be described as GTA Online. Essentially, you have a cops vs. robbers (Enforcers vs. Criminals) faction scenario, with the player selecting their side. Once you've selected a faction, server, etc., you can create a character.   NOTE: APB offers excellent customization options.   There is an in-game radio that you can use to import music, character, clothing, and vehicle customization studios with quite a bit of freedom, and several modifications available to influence your character, vehicle, and weapon abilities.  There are also plenty of weapons to choose between in the game, so you can build a loadout that suits your playstyle.  APB can become very competitive though, so it is recommended to bring a large amount of patience with you when you play! All in all I do recommend the game as I've found myself repeatedly coming back to it.  
766	1	a	Kinda addictive
768	1	a	The only masks available to my characters seem to be bags of garbage.
770	1	a	That last time i played this game was in 2013 i was ok now it looks like is it a good game .      i have miss it .   add me if you want to play with me .
772	1	a	Great customization in characters and vehicles. Based solely on PVP, which is usually a good thing, but the community tends to be rather harsh to new players/bad players. In a way, this game is an online version of the Grand Theft Auto series.
774	1	a	I saw a lot of people play this game , I decided to download it , I played for 9 hours straight. I guess I like it.
776	1	a	its good
778	1	a	Awesome and addicting game!
780	1	a	this is an awesome game but whenever you drive the FPS Bumps way down. Which really messes up everything even, even With a 960 (Graphics Card) your FPS bumps down! But i still Love this game it was the first steam game i ever got! Back in 2012 so i would recommend this game to ppl who have a QUALTIY Computer   CPU: 2.4 GHz Intel Core 2 Quad or equivalent AMD X4 RAM 4 GB OS: Windows Vista 64-Bit / Windows 7 64-Bit Video Card: NVIDIA GeForce 8800 GT 512MB or AMD equivalent Sound Card: Yes Free Disk Space: 7 GB  This will give you about 10 FPS while Driving!  CPU: Intel Core i5 4460 3.2 GHz RAM: 8 GB OS: Windows 8.1 Pro Video Card: Msi Geforce GTX 960 Gaming 2G Free Disk Space: 831 GB Left  This is what i Have and i get only around 20 to 26 while driving but a perfect 60 FPS while running! SO I WOULD RECOMMEND IT!    only with good PC Specs!
782	1	a	Good Game, but sometimes its crashing ;)
784	1	a	pay to win, still fun doe.
786	1	a	Quite difficult at first, and rage inducing, p2w in some aspects but stock weapons still get the job done
788	1	a	good game its kinda p2p but its still real fun take some mmo put it with gta 4 and tf2 hats and there you have these game!!!!  9/10
790	1	a	This game is similar to GTA. U spend loads of hours customizing ur character. The weapons are great and easy to use. Get in a car and begin the action. U can just mess around, do objectives, or kill people. A great free-to-play game.  ✰7/10✰
792	1	a	AMAZNING JUST AMAZING its like a free to play GTA TOTTELY WORTH A MUST GET
794	1	a	Well, I like this game. It's not great, but not complete crap either. For being a Free-To-Play game, it's surprisingly competent. No such thing, as 'Pay2Win' here. Yes, there are some premium guns, that are slightly better, than a free ones, but overall, weapons are pretty good balanced. I know people, who are successful in the game, without spending any real money on it. I also know people, who spent thousands of dollars on this game, just because they like it a lot. Also, I like the fact, that this game is a pure action-based, and not some mmorpg. Meaning, you dont have to spend hundreds of hours, grinding xp points, just to be vital, all you need, is a gun and you own shooting skills. PROS: - Great customization. You can create any symbol or sign you want. You can paint your clothes and your car in any color or pattern. You can add any tattoo on you character, you can only imagine. - Decent weapon balance. - Very 'soft' F2P factor. You can buy a good gun, using in-game money, for 10 days lease, and if you're a decent player, you can earn your money back in less than a hour of gameplay. - No 'character level' is required. Your 'newborn' character can easily defeat a max-rank opponent, if you are a better player, than he is. CONS: - The game is not very user-friendly. If you're new to the game, you may want to look at some tutorials on youtube, or something, to figure things out. - Old game engine -&gt; bad optimization -&gt; bad game performance + outdated visuals. - If you'll decide to spend some real money on this game, you'll may be disappointed with prices. 30 dollars for a one permanent gun? 50-200 dollars for a pack? I find it a bit too much. - Small and inexperienced developers team. Maybe they doing their best to improve this old (2009) game. But, it's not really enough. Game is playable though, I'll give them that.
796	1	a	I hate this ♥♥♥♥ing piece of ♥♥♥♥ game with all of my ♥♥♥♥ing passion to the point where I would reccomend it to anyone.
798	1	a	I like the girl on the cover so the game is ok I guess
800	1	a	This game is always fun to play. All they need to do to make it better, is ban all the hackers and run the game on a better engine.
802	1	a	Awesome and funny game, where the customization options of weapons, clothes, vehicles etc. are just endless! 
804	1	a	You may run into a hacker in 1% of the missions you do, the rest of these extreemly powerful players and groups you run into are just very skilled players with thousands of hours of game play messing around on their 15th character. It is very GTAish in general but more focused on customization and strategic game play. If you don't use your brain in this game you are just going to die repeatedly.  This is my 3rd most played game of all time and my most played Steam game by a large margin. The game play is emergent and constantly shifting in difficulty. Even if I put in another 2000 hours I doubt I'll be able to play on a level I know I'm capable of and see others do.
806	1	a	Its pretty good. Has the feel of an open world shooter. You can do so much with the customastion(all most to much). To sum it up think of GTA but you can be a cop and theres a lot more players. Oh and be careful to look out for 'pay to win'players cause they are everyware.
808	1	a	best online free roam game!!!! 
810	1	a	What about this game? Well In general it's a Great Game. What's great about it? Well let's start off with the type of player you are. Basically I probably Just split to 3.  If you are the type of guy/girl that loves to play a game for it's customization (Wink Wink Me) and obviously play shooter games in general (FPS/3rdPS) then APB:Reloaded has done it right. The shapes they provide is not alot but enough for you to find shapes to go to your design. Of coaurse this comes with a draw back which is the ammount of shapes you can put in. Where you have to get premium in order to get the best experience.  I'm sure there are players who Just want to play it and meet friends depending on the other party If he/she is friendly and wants to make new friends or just plain playing with friends for the fun of it like CS:GO then this is also probably for those type of people,  There are also the players that wanted to get GTA V BUT can't afford it. APB:Reloaded is another small game Just like it and for those players to enjoy. Sure you won't get the full experience of how GTA V actually plays. But it's close enough that people who play GTA:SA will stay in the game for a couple of months.  Those to me is what make APB:Reloaded a Great Game to me. BUT Obviously there are drawbacks.  The Animations/World/Lighting arn't the best BUT It will do just fine. Even tho Reloaded Productions Keeps teasing us about the new Engine or Lighting.........
812	1	a	i get murdered everytime i spawn on a mission  15/10 would recommend
814	1	a	GTA MMO, cops an robbers.........Pure addictive, Best player an Car customization iv seen, unlimited, just arrest ♥♥♥♥♥
816	1	a	Great game, Now if only you'd fix the steering.
818	1	a	Once upon a time when I a wee man, I found a rock, and I loved that rock, I lost it one day and I didn't give a ♥♥♥♥. That's how I felt uninstalling this game.
820	1	a	First hour updating screen before you can play. I don't understand how people can even get 1000 hours in this game unless they really like to update.  10/10  Still updating..
822	1	a	One of my most favorite games :)
824	1	a	This game sucks.
826	1	a	THIS GAME IS AWSOME GTA ON CRACK MUST GET
828	1	a	this is one great piece of work,and in the same time its just another P2W why make it free if 99.99% of the weapons and gear has to be bought with real money but here is what is say,i realy love this game but DO NOT DOWNLOAD IT UNLESS YOUR REALY REALY GOOD AT Shooting games, I warn you all its a heavy P2W,AND THE WORSE THING IS THE RAnked players can go and ♥♥♥♥up ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ranked players  Graphics:5/10  NPC's:7/10  Fighting: well this depends on you  Vehicels: 9/10  Customization: 100/10 IGN LOLZ  Design:9/10  Finaly Rate it 7/10 coz its a ♥♥♥♥in P2W
830	1	a	Very easy to get in. I once got on a map where a little kid was thinking he was talking over the mic After telling him to calm down. He began to tell me to get on mic. later someone used mic and acted like me lol
832	1	a	Good game. It's like GTA, have the camera of Mass Effect, and the likeness of Sleeping Dogs combined to create a game worth your time.
834	1	a	Great game.. and better if you play with other 3 friends, but get ruined becouseis full of cheaters, and last times that game turned completly PAY 2 WIN..
836	1	a	This game kicks ♥♥♥... literally... it kicked my ♥♥♥ so hard i'm currently writing this review. So lets get to it!  APB: Reloaded is a pretty complex game but lets just say that if you are a fan of GTA, this game will blow your mind!  Mine was, because the game has tons of variety of customization! Paint your car, Get your Enforcer a tattoo, make your own badass logo and once you've made your logo apply it to your shirt on your Enforcer while doing missions in a massive Third Person shooter scale.  But it's not just about shooting ♥♥♥♥ up. As a Criminal you can rob pedestrians for money, jewels, electronics and other needed stuff.  And while we are on the subject of the Criminal side let's talk about it.  Mostly daily races in 2 open world maps for you to look around and find these hidden passages so you can decide 'Am I really going to drive on the highway or get into the tunnel as a shortcut?'.  This game has variety and it's what makes APB so unique!  However the main flaw of this game is that it's not very fun when going alone, infact it can be downright boring so i suggest that you get a friend or join a clan right at the start of the game because it's so much more fun.  And it lacks a story on how these factions ended up fighting each other. Or well you actually get to see that when looking at the Enforcer and Criminal cinematics wich looks amazingly beautiful.  This game is beautiful when it comes to graphics.  And the gameplay is hell of alot of fun!  As a Criminal I robbed an electronics store while an Enforcer sees it and then a mission begins where i need to drop off my stuff at a very different place than the original drop off.  And the guns and rifles in this game looks, feels and sound powerful as hell!  So with that being said, this game earns a 9/10! If you are a fan of Shooters, shooot em up games, GTA and even first person games you will find APB a game that fits into your library.
838	1	a	HINT: Play with your friends!
840	1	a	The poor man's GTA V.
842	1	a	Really Good Game to play if your all for player vs player, I trully love APB but this game can be a bit much at times, especially when your getting owned by a chick in a thong with a bazooka :( , other than that i love the fast amoun tof freedom we get with the customization, this game may seem sort of p2w but most of the weapons in the armas market can be rented with ingame points from events.
844	1	a	To be honest i've never played this game, i downloaded it, then i sorta afked for a while and accidently had it set to 'launch when ready'. Then i came back a while later ( a few days) closed the game, realized i didn't want to play it and uninstalled. all things considered, not a bad experiance with the game.
846	1	a	Great game, dont know why everyone gives it thumbs down? me and my mate downloaded the game played it for 4 hours and loved every minute, personally i would reccomend being a cop :) 
848	1	a	ى السكر كوكسسسvسكرسكر English translation: Allah akbar
850	1	a	I played this game with 3 of my friends. All of us rage quitted atleast once.  Now my friends don't wanna play anymore :(  0/5 Pay to Win 5/5 Game 3/5 Overall After playing this game for so long, my doctor told me I'm a sadist.
852	1	a	Just buy GTA.
854	1	a	&gt; Dad gets this game  &gt; His 1.8k PC cant run this lmao
856	1	a	...
858	1	a	This game.... This is the best game for everyone.  Pros-  This game will raise your blood pressure higher than Sharon Stone's up skirt shot in Basic Instinct.  This game will cause you to rage so much that you will want to punch your monitor and smash your computer. This game will make you throw your headset across the room, and set it on fire. This game will cause you to spend a bunch of real money on reskins of guns that are already in the game!  Cons- This game has way too much customization ablitiy, either your character, or your car.  
860	1	a	This game is...eh. GAY!
862	1	a	:)
864	1	a	Have you played GTA and like that sort of games? Then this is definitely something for you! Enforcers and criminals fight each other, choose your side, and play! - It's online :-)
866	1	a	Well now, overall I say yes to this game Its a great game. You have the Crims and the Enfs fighting eachother. You are put into missions against random enemy groups and have to overcome different obstacles. Everything put together in a 'micro-story'.  You level up yourself and your standing with your contacts. While progressing you unlock more and more Items to buy. Here is a little problem: for real money you get good weapons and equipment from the beginning, but from my experience, I can tell that you don't have real problems with the usual weaponry to defeat the premium weaponry. Sometimes it's frustrating, what comes from sometimes bad matchmaking. Resulting in Low level and low threat players having to fight high level and/or high threat Players.  You can get rid of that problem, when you play with one or even more friends (up to 3 possible in a premade team) Hacking is pretty rare in the game, even though many people call everyone a hacker .. well thats just the way it is.  The customizing features in this game are pretty amazing! You can customize your character like hell. From body and face, over tatoos and even Clothes with custom colours and symbols. The same goes for the cars, eventhough you need to progress very far in the game inorder to get the custom parts for the cars, but you can customize the overall colour and still put custom symbols on the car. And you can customize songs, to let your enemies, whenever you kill 'em, hear your favourite song or even some stupid annoying sound with much 'heyheyhey' in it (please don't do that ... I hate those!)  All in all it's a good game, it has it's weaknesses but if you can deal with some frustration at the beginning and sometimes a little server lag you are good to go :)  
868	1	a	Okay, so...I'll admit it right here and now: APB has it's perks. Customizable characters, cars, even creating your own theme song to play for the enemy when they get gunned down. You can steal cars from civilians whether you're a cop or a robber, and you're always wanting to get to the next place as fast as you can. This game does have it's problems, however: Shoddy hacking control means there is going to be a LOT of people using aimbots and 'legit' cheats, so expect to have several unfair matches, and even worse matches where you're against just really good people while your team sucks. There are some even worse balancing issues, with some guns being leagues better than others; but at least you will know which guns those are, since everyone will be using them. If you have patience, and can just look at the fun parts of this game...I heartily recommend you try it out for a little while; it takes some getting used to, but all in all, it's not all that bad of a game, since it's free...
870	1	a	i consider this game better than gta
872	1	a	it sometimes does the thing where it's enjoyable.
874	1	a	Its grown alot since the old days, play it with freinds.
876	1	a	great F2P game, its basically a Free version of Grand Theft Auto, if you have no money and you want to play an open world fun Gangsta game, get this!
878	1	a	Awesome game bros! I seriously recommend this game if you like open world or high customization game! Have fun bros!!!
880	1	a	Great game.. and better if you play with other 3 friends, but get ruined becouseis full of cheaters, and last times that game turned completly PAY 2 WIN..
882	1	a	seems like a good game, although I haven't played enough to say. would recommend. 
884	1	a	i feel like we all play this game just to relive our years in highschool  'this is cool as ♥♥♥♥ m8' - Dhafo 2k16
886	1	a	My grandchildren graduated, yet I'm still sittin' here, waitin' the god damn Engine upgrade!  10 outta' 10.
888	1	a	i feel like we all play this game just to relive our years in highschool  'this is cool as ♥♥♥♥ m8' - Dhafo 2k16
890	1	a	Played this game for 2 years now. But the server let the game down! Also it is kinda Pay to Win.
892	1	a	ok here is what you need to know  When you are free to play player You Need...  Shooting skills TryHard on every misson (with pure weapons) FarmHard to buy 3 solted weapon  When you Pay for weapons You Need....  No shooting skills needed just close your eyes and hold the fire botton bam you rekt evry one  ________________________________________________________________________________   unbalanced weapons   normal sniper : slow your running speed / hard to aim / can't use it while on car Payed sniper : won't slow your running speed / you can 360 no scope with it / you can use it while on car  normal assault rifle : sooo hard to aim / rip on close ranges Payed assault rifle : soooooo easy to aim with / and guss what? it's smg as well  ________________________________________________________________________________  That things makes you quit the game so unfair  BUT : the idea of the game is so cool it's like free Gta V
894	1	a	Such a magnificient game. Graphics better than Crytek Engine, a story line better than that of Skyrim's, and more action-packed than a game of Call of Duty. This game stands out from many other games I've played before because it has guns and cars. Care to name me a game that does the both? I think not! The publisher is not money-driven, and listens to the wonderful community consisting of kidz and queefz. Never have I had met such wonderful people in such a game, wearing Hollister shirts and tight shorts in a game.
896	1	a	such a silly game, but it was entertaining.
898	1	a	Good and fun game definetly recommend it :D
900	1	a	like a GTA. very cool
902	1	a	I'm not sure what exactly keeps me playing apb, but I've logged 1000+ hours over the last 3 years, and that has to count for something. APB is a dog-eat-dog world, and unless you have a high tolerance for ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and are a fast learner, you're going to have a pretty bad time.   I can not, in good conscience, just freely recommend it to anyone. The game has its magic, whether it be the depth of character customisation, occasional wonky physics interaction, or just the thril of combat (when it's a its finest), but sadly it is largely drowned out by the amount of frustration and salt this game can generate. I think most of that problem stems from the fact that the remaining playerbase is largely old, crusty and bloodthirsty, who don't know when to let up and give the newer guys a chance without destroying them immediately.  I've been around the strrets of san paro for a while now, and i'd be glad to offer anyone who wants it my advice and a teammate. I am not the best by any means, but having a friend in game goes a long way. Just send me a message and i'll join you
904	1	a	it sick it ♥♥♥♥ its revolting its insulting
906	1	a	What can be said about APB reloaded? A lot. I came from the orginal All points, which was a super fun game. This game sort of lives up to the orginal. Its fun, people are (sometimes) nice. Very well balanced at low levels. Customization  Pros: Customization (character/Cars) Weapons (tons) Driving Custom Decals Level system Rank system Group party Extra events Ram Raids (crimes) Faction choice  Cons: PTW golds Costly Perm weapons with extra damage Unbalanced game servers Reward to spend ratio low  Overall PTW -2 Fun +2 Customization +2 Weapons +2 Multiplayer +2 Money Ratios -2 funky gameplay -2  Overall 6/10. Not bad, not much of a free to play game.
908	1	a	Love this game, it's very interesting, high customization level, great variety of weapons and vehicles, and there are a lot of good people who play this, there are a couple issues, lag being one, and hackers being the other, but over-all this game deserves an 8.5 out of 10 in my books.
910	1	a	really good game i highly recommend it
912	1	a	Awesome game but add more Cars
914	1	a	The game it self is cool.         YouTube™ Video:  &nbsp;
916	1	a	A fun game to ♥♥♥♥ around in, nothing more. Better with friends, hell alone. Its a fun game and ok
918	1	a	sorry about the scar.
920	1	a	only two things i reme,ber r good about it:  1- costumization 2- the diffrent music that plays when u die  everything else is meh at best
922	1	a	170 hours ♥♥♥♥ tons of kills and missions completed , I have to say this is one of the best FTP games I've ever played, ever since its release from RTW. Great and huge customization levels allows you to create any kind of character you want, any kind of logo, any cand of car, its all up to you. PvP based with some RPG elements , It's just fun and great. Altough its poorly optimized and it gets boring after a while all I can say is.. after 170 hours of gameplay reaching level 160 .. I think there is no point for me to continue leveling up or keep playing this game at all, I think I got enough of it already but these hours I spent on this game they have been all worth it, you should absolutely give it a try yourself even though sometimes it pisses you off.
924	1	a	Hey guys, after a shítstorm of playtime I decided to give the community some of my toughts.  Obviously, we are talking about a game thats still alive after several years, and it has a reason, but I think this is about to be gone. Back in 2013 I stopped playing this game, and now in 2015 I gave it another go. I was dissappointed, not because it went worse or dead, it isnt. But there is no such new stuff that players were always dreaming of. More than a year gap, and I can say, nothing new, just some OP Armas Marketplace weapons, and a car kit. I was expecting at least a new vehicle, a roadmap, or at least hackers gone (and im not even that courageous to dream about a new district). Anyways, I hope once the server merge is done, devs will give attention to such a stuff like these, so now, I suggesting this game.  The pros: -Big community, you will always find buddies to play with, or get help. -Promo codes, I hope devs willing to keep provide them. -Open worlds with some gamemodes, and different servers for each (to make the matchmaker more fair). -Random and kinda colorful missions. Every mission is a different story. -Customization, including: music maker, car sound/kits/paint, Sims like character making+tattoos, and a lots of clothes...And this is the main point of the game, seriously, it has no pair. I would rather describe this game as a F2P art game with shooting possibilities. You can almost literally can customize everything, if you like designing, you will love this game. -Decent amount of perks/mods for cars/character/weapons, there is no best or worst set, everything depends on your playstyle. -Marketplace, where you can sell and show your badass stuff. Or buy. -Events. Make use of them, they are usually nice farming possibilities.  The cons: -Unbalanced weapons. Some of them that you can buy for real money, are obviously the way more powerful than those you can buy for in-game money, giving a p2w feeling. Still, you can try out some for free. -Server lags, not an usual problem, altough when it kicks in, you better just log off (I hope server merge will kill this). -Hackers. They will be always around with tasty aimbot and wallhack. FairFight is not enough to keep them away. -A lot of annoying no life as$holes, who like to harass others, even if they are on the same side. I just suggest ignore asap. -Weird car physics. They seem to be too slow and too heavy. -Designing possibilities are too limited with freemium account.  The two sided: -If you dont want to play missions, there is a possibility to hang around, race etc...That means of course, if you are on a mission, you still can get rammed and harassed by any other player. -Epic grinding. It keeps you playing, although without premium account its much harder to get money.  Tips for newbies: -Do the tutorial missions asap, look for the one that gives you a LIFETIME weapon. You will need it, you really dont want to re-buy your weapon every 10 days. -Spend some time at Social district and try out every editor. Also, thats the best place you can ask for help. -If you harassed by anyone 'superior' to you, just use '/report *name*' then '/ignore *name*', and if needed change instance. -Make sure you switched off auto-ready system, so you wont go on mission until you dont want. -Save money and joker tickets, dont spend them inmedetadly. -Always go for sure, check your ammo and grenades every time. -Just a performance tip, when you enter a district, take a trip from its end to the other, so most things will load, and you lower the chance of a performance lag.  I hope some of you can use it. If you have questions just ask. See you on battlefield!
926	1	a	Great awesome game!
928	1	a	Unbalanced, unoptimized, 'glitchy' game. A good ide, but horrible implementation.
930	1	a	omg i absolutely love this game! It's basically grand theft auto, when you have missions, you can mug people, customize your car(s) and character(s)/outfit(s) to what fits you and YOU CAN BE A COP! but criminals still rule the streets hehe.
932	1	a	me and my friend vinny went on a multicultural adventure to run eachother over with cars it was fun i was italian he was mexican except the tostito chips and salsa were missin g so i shooted him in the face with my rifle and he deaded i spend 10 hours making me character it was fun i also cried myself t sleep because vinny said the game was bad because i shooted him in the face but i told him to make betteter character liek me so he did and we both were very happy it was very fun to create characeters i hope that you enjoy your adventures in apb unloaded like me
934	1	a	If you like the following then this game is for you: ♥♥♥♥ engines, OP ♥♥♥♥, Terrible games, Slowly dieing games, Badly optimized games. 
936	1	a	Nice, like an GTA game but more changed...
938	1	a	A simplistically brilliant pvp game, there is nothing like it. Awesome customization. Funtimes, played best with a friend or two. Highly addictive AND... you can enjoy the whole game FREE.   Are there downsides? Of course. Old game. Imbalanced matchmaking at times. A few hackers, but they do get banned.  Is it still worth it? Absolutely addictive PVP. There is no other game like it. Definitely something you will play and come back to again and again and again.
940	1	a	Great game if you have the skill to play in the horrible matchmaking. Insane amounts of customization for your character,vehicles and guns. Takes a long time if you want a grindy MMO( rougly 700 hours to hit max level ) 
942	1	a	Great game. You should try it :3
944	1	a	Was killed by gang of half naked Juggalos in a 'free candy' van while they were screaming;   10/10 like skyrim with too much creative freedom.
946	1	a	The game it self is cool.         YouTube™ Video:  &nbsp;
948	1	a	Such a great free to play game! With alot of free codes for premium and others No wonder its so popular, I HIGHLY recomend this game such fun!
950	1	a	third person shooting open world roaming online game. sometimes laggy but can be played.
952	1	a	Awesome game but add more Cars
954	1	a	This game makes callum hard...
956	1	a	Pretty cool
958	1	a	A game like GTA,Way more massive. Sure,It doesnt have a countryside like GTA,But it sure is a great freemium game. Its a massive open world with up to 50 enforcers and 50 criminals..  and nobody gets out alives.
960	1	a	GTA in a free2play way.
962	1	a	It's a good FTP game and all, but the devs are ♥♥♥♥ing money ♥♥♥♥♥s.
964	1	a	This game is free, and outrageously fun!
966	1	a	Great Game
968	1	a	Good Game 10/10  -Mugging People -Ram Shop -Good graphic -Cool Weapons -Cool Cars
970	1	a	Nice, like an GTA game but more changed...
972	1	a	Great game if you have the skill to play in the horrible matchmaking. Insane amounts of customization for your character,vehicles and guns. Takes a long time if you want a grindy MMO( rougly 700 hours to hit max level ) 
974	1	a	Really Good Game 7/10
976	1	a	170 hours ♥♥♥♥ tons of kills and missions completed , I have to say this is one of the best FTP games I've ever played, ever since its release from RTW. Great and huge customization levels allows you to create any kind of character you want, any kind of logo, any cand of car, its all up to you. PvP based with some RPG elements , It's just fun and great. Altough its poorly optimized and it gets boring after a while all I can say is.. after 170 hours of gameplay reaching level 160 .. I think there is no point for me to continue leveling up or keep playing this game at all, I think I got enough of it already but these hours I spent on this game they have been all worth it, you should absolutely give it a try yourself even though sometimes it pisses you off.
978	1	a	Right off the bat, the game has the best customisation I have ever seen. You can customise almost everything, to a staggering degree and you could find yourself just making new clothes for hours. But the tutorial is horrible, and I wouldn't have been able to get into it at all if not for a friendly player who was willing to help me get started.  As for the gameplay itself, eeeeh it's okay. I can see a lot of people really enjoying this, but while fun, isn't for me. Definately try it out though, it's free-to-play.  Customisation 10/10 Gameplay (Personal opinion) 6/10
980	1	a	APB : R is a fully functional and versatile 3rd Person shooter. One can say that it's a Free to play but revamped version of Gta's Cop And Robbers.   You could be your own in design and music.   -Customizing your character to fit your own unique style. -Creating your own ingame music to listen to on the radio or as your death theme for your enemies that tread in our path. - And Using the tools in your arsenal in combat to destroy and rebuild. (*Repair Gun*)  To me because the game allows soo much that it has the possibility to become bigger than it already is, A new engine is coming out and possibilities are being unlocked. Don't get dragged behind, Gear up and be as awesome as you are today.  BECOME THE HERO SAN PARO DESERVES OR THE VILLIAN IT REGRETS . -Jam
982	1	a	APB reloaded is a great open world 3D Massively Multiplayer shooter. This game is great and I seriously recommend this game to vetern game players. The game has some negative things like Pay2Win assets that allows rich spoiled people to have everything they desire from a one hit kill assault rifle. To a 1 second reload rocket launcher with a radius of the base of the Pentagon. It also has much trouble with people 'Hacking' as some people call it. However its just a simple means of people downloading Aimbots for it and ruining everyones gaming experience. If this were to be No Pay2Win and you could buy this game for 5 USD. And have a decent ban system and anti 'Hack' system. It would be worth the 5 USD. 9/10 without Aimbotters.
984	1	a	Lot's of rage. You'll get better, but you pay the price and risk losing a couple friends on the way. I'm glad to see the servers have finally improved. Worth playing? I'd say why not? It's free.
986	1	a	A game like GTA,Way more massive. Sure,It doesnt have a countryside like GTA,But it sure is a great freemium game. Its a massive open world with up to 50 enforcers and 50 criminals..  and nobody gets out alives.
988	1	a	The most fun and addicting game ever. A must play if you love GTA and the old crackdowns for xbox. great game play loads of missions and events. Been playing this game since the first day it came out and a little before that even. been through its ups and downs and i must say its only gone up hill! 9/10 GAME! XD
990	1	a	Great game but get ready to get ur ♥♥♥♥ kicked. Many overpowered enemys. This game leads you to buy packs and stuff. HIGHLY RECCOMEND ONLY IF YOU PLAY WITH A FRIEND!
992	1	a	A decent game , fun to play with friends 9/10
994	1	a	you want action? you want speed? this game is packed with action and adrenaline my friends. INSANE level of customization, customize your character anytime you want, your clothes, your tattos, your car,your theme, your graffiti , the guns, and chicks its got it all, and as a bonus you get free lag and random fps drops.
996	1	a	The game it self is cool.         YouTube™ Video:  &nbsp;
998	1	a	It is a monster that consumes time and happiness, its like a drug that you hate yourself for but cant stop, its both so great and so terrible at the same time. 10/10 Would play APB
1000	1	a	it sick it ♥♥♥♥ its revolting its insulting
1002	1	a	The anti cheat system is garbage, the developers are terrible and cant keep promises, they are money hungy, its taken them years to do the most simple task AND not to mention they dont really have any live support or anything so if you need help asap i have bad news for you. HOWEVER if you can get over this frustraiton and endless waiting for simple things its a great game, you customise pretty much everything yourself to your own ability, making your own clothes is easy peasy if you have the tallent. id say %50 %50 . you have to kinda be patient with this game... for years
1004	1	a	I have more than 800 hours in this game, a R255 criminal a R255 enforcer (and then some more). I tried to make a long and detailed review, Steam didn't like it. so here goes the short version:  1.You will die, a lot. 2.No matter how many opponents you kill, killing alone will not suffice to win the mission. 3.There are many cheaters. 4.The players do not feel motivated to go to their according TL-districts any more, instead they troll in lower districts and expect anyone else to do the same. 5.It was not p2w in the past, but G1 tries to make it p2w now. Let us pray they see what they are doing before it is too late. 6.This game is laggsh, keep moving so you don't get insta-killed by highpingers. 7.The game tries to make you rage, stay cool. 8.There are many unfriendly people on the european server, be better than them: be friendly and be mature. 9.There are many 13 year olds, ignore them. All they do is blaming, crying, and annoying anyways. 10.There are trolls who are ♥♥♥♥♥♥ because they don't kill enough people to win the mission somehow. Drive around them if you can, get out of your car and get a new one if you can't 12.If an opponent whispers to you and you don't like what you read do not reply, use Backspace to auto-reply then replace the '/w' with '/ignore'. 13.The game maps are awesome big, awesome detailed, awesome feature-rich, and awesome dynamic. 14.Many missions take place at the same time and accross the entire map, it is a wonderful chaos if you have a very good computer - and a nightmare if you don't. 15.There are so many different weapons and modifications that you will get dizzy. 16.Each weapon and modification will cause a significant impact on how the game plays (and turns out), really. 17.Did i mention you will die a lot? 18.You will have awesome moments, funny moments, great battles and greater victories. 19.You will kill opposing players and they will be like 'W...T...F...', or like 'Whoa....daaaaaang'. 20.You will be like that too when you get killed. 21.The 3rd person perspective is awesum. 22.No, there is no way you can get a 1st person perspective :p. 23.Also not on your Sniper, nuuuuu. 24.Your character will look just as good as you make it look. Mine are haaaawt! 25.Your car can look even better. 26.No matter how much you die, keep pushing, keep a clear mind, keep twisting them. If you still fail - at least you tried. 27.There needs to be a penalty for playing in lower districts again, i mean a REAL penalty, no buggered matchmaking.  8/10 for one of my greatest game-loves, growing a bit old and overmodded with silly stuff.
1006	1	a	APB Best game of my life hitbox 11/10, server ms 69/10 and its free to play
1008	1	a	Stupid, mindless fun. But that's the whole point.
1010	1	a	This game is so fun. The customization is beast. You can make yourself with the correct clothing look almost like a pumpkin.
1012	1	a	I am highly wrecking mend this games. It is good games, and I am glad having buy this games because I playing games all the time. I like games like this because games like this put other gamings to shames. Sorry foring my englishes not very goods. As I was sayings this games is very good apb I buy for friend and is make them happy in their lives.
1014	1	a	This yes it's my game, play it since it came out in 2009 and it is AMAIZING, its one of the games that made me play on pc and not on console. it has a great community! The level of costumization is just WOW and its not pay2win at all since you can buy guns with the game money easely!
1016	1	a	only two things i reme,ber r good about it:  1- costumization 2- the diffrent music that plays when u die  everything else is meh at best
1018	1	a	i higly recomend this game if you want to rage
1020	1	a	This game use to be extremely broken... Trust me, I remember playing it too when it first came out. They fixed it, I having a blast running MOFOs down and blasting them now! Lets team up and kill them together. Currently on the USEast Server
1022	1	a	Right off the bat, the game has the best customisation I have ever seen. You can customise almost everything, to a staggering degree and you could find yourself just making new clothes for hours. But the tutorial is horrible, and I wouldn't have been able to get into it at all if not for a friendly player who was willing to help me get started.  As for the gameplay itself, eeeeh it's okay. I can see a lot of people really enjoying this, but while fun, isn't for me. Definately try it out though, it's free-to-play.  Customisation 10/10 Gameplay (Personal opinion) 6/10
1024	1	a	APB Reloaded is an awesome game if you like Third Person Shooters. it has good character customization, it is not really 'Pay To Win'. Try it out, it is Free To Play. Its is Enfocers Vs Criminals.  Edit: Well Game is still good but crawling with hackers, and little pay to win. lol I still like it.
1026	1	a	Now that I have mashed 1.4k hours into this game, a review is probably necessary.   I would say this game is very fun, I started off as a crappy silver player and carried myself up to gold. The opponents may be hard but it's very fun and challenging.   Honestly, this is just a free to play version of GTA series where there are stupid bugs and glitches still in game. To be perfectly honest the game is great, if you were to spend about 60USD you will be able to play the game without having to buy guns every 10 days; basically a Pay to Win game.   Keep in mind that this is a Third Person Shooter game and although it has an anti-ban programme it really doesn't do ♥♥♥♥.  Also if you think people hack in this game, it just shows that you're very bad at APB :)  Note that this game is much more fun to play with your friends, as it has tactical values and teamwork necesseties in this god forsaken game.  Also Han is dead :)  Have fun
1028	1	a	Free to Play. Macht spaß
1030	1	a	the game is cool
1032	1	a	Good TPS!  You can drive, shoot. Pure PvP! (I'm an idiot! xD ) It has a lot of guns, even a social map (it's rare to see that in a shooter game).  The best: Customization. You can even draw things on your clothes! *-* &lt;3  The worst: Cash guns with time limit. I hate when devs put those things! -.-'
1034	1	a	Ive been playing this game for years and i think its time to write a review.  Cons:  1.Toxic people, a ton of them. 2. Horrible servers. 3. Everything is too expensive on the Armas marketplace, i mean seriously, 20$ for a weapon thats a reskin of the base game item. 4. Matchmaking is horrible. 5. People take the game too seriously, they have to win every mission and hate people that do bad, its kinda pathetic.  Pros: 1.There are some good people in the toxic community. 2.Its pretty fun when you get used to the game, if you can handle the servers, that is. 3.The cars/customization options. 4.Same as 3, but with clothes and character customization.
1036	1	a	One of the best Free OpenWorld Multiplayer games :)) There must be more games like this one..!!
1038	1	a	gaem wont even launch.    11/10  youll have more fun killing yourself.
1040	1	a	This game is truly amazing, but the only thing I hate is that it's hard to find police when you want to just mess around and not do missions, and you start off with very little (which isn't a problem). But everything else is great from the physics, the atmasphere, and others!
1042	1	a	APB:R Is a dynamic play style game. Some elements of the game include dynamic events (Like Witnessing Crimes for enforcers and mugging and ram raiding for criminals). The customization aspect of the game is incredible, you can make your own symbols using the editor or choose from a library of preset decals to place on your clothes or vehicles however you see fit. The gameplay is a mix of open combat and close quaters combat across foru different maps. Events are included like easter egg hunts around holidays like easter. If you like causing or stopping chaos or police roleplay you will like this game.
1044	1	a	This game is complete and utter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, but it can be a good time waster with your dumb friends to dumb around in but expect to get shot up a bunch because everyone else pays for guns.
1046	1	a	Nice open world game.. and i can customize my own character, outfit, and vehicle
1048	1	a	This game is cancer, but i still love it! Dont play it if you dont have milions of dollars to spend.
1050	1	a	A game with loads of customizations. Somehow fun to socialize with other players. Yet it is a pay-2-win game, the gameplay could be a total frustration without investing(or pouring) your hard-earned cash into this game. So does further customizations at a decent level, same. So basically, the game do everything it can to drain your money.  If you don't mind being bullied in the game by those 'investors', you should enjoy a good time.
1052	1	a	Start in a crappy car and then get screwed up by grenades in missions, start doing stunts around the city, land the car on your squad member R.I.P Chicken Nuggetz :(
1054	1	a	Everyone hates Everyone. team mates hate team mates, enemys hate enemys. seriously feuds are a common occurance in this game.
1056	1	a	Uninstall works very nicely.
1058	1	a	nice game kinda like gta but it could have some work :D 
1060	1	a	A good game people should play. The support is bad and you will get stomped. There is a high learning curve. People never want to adapt to the situation and yell when they can't win. I've been accused of hacking 8 times in the past week. This one game makes everyone really pissy for some reason.  10/10 best experiment on estrogen in men in the past century.
1062	1	a	thes game is awesome
1064	1	a	One game that is usually so bad but can be a lot of fun wish they had spent the time to make it better
1066	1	a	great game
1068	1	a	I love the game ;) spent 1210 Hours on it and i didnt regret it. You can't say that about evrygame all the haters who this apb sucks just don't know how to play yet give it a week If you're not in love with it... well then u just lame af ;)
1070	1	a	Good game actually if you have bunch of crazy head friends play with. Had loads of fun in city street fights and road fights with our bad ♥♥♥♥ custom rides. Tactics,creativity and fun what makes the game enjoyable, comms is the key also. There are its cons and pros, but it's a good go !!!!
1072	1	a	this game is cool. you should get it. 
1074	1	a	♥♥♥♥♥♥ servers, hacker, pay to win.. but a lot of fun!  
1076	1	a	so i downloaded this game for the first time ever and it just crashes on start up
1078	1	a	Gets on, gets hit by a car driven by a little kid, flys across the sky, dies, gets tbaged, spends $5 on ammo..  - 11/10 Would waste more time and real $ to play again.
1080	1	a	A good game people should play. The support is bad and you will get stomped. There is a high learning curve. People never want to adapt to the situation and yell when they can't win. I've been accused of hacking 8 times in the past week. This one game makes everyone really pissy for some reason.  10/10 best experiment on estrogen in men in the past century.
1082	1	a	This game is so good for a free-to-play. Like seriously, it came way ahead of its time. There's infinite customization, wicked fun missions and gunplay.  But the servers are ♥♥♥♥.
1084	1	a	This game is very good at two things being a quick play and keeping me and my friends coming back. It's very basic in a sense and you may scream in outrage at the fact that the weapons and some other stuff 'expires' after a certain time, I kind of like this personally. The aim of the game is to raise your standing to unlock what they have and you unlock the next NPC. I like the way you raise standing you can do standard whole map mission or if your me and a crimanal you can just play about, earn money while doing it :) In a nut shell it's a smaller version of GTA but you can also play as the 'cops'
1086	1	a	I really like this game. It's fun .. but one of the biggest upsets is how many times it crashes. Whether I'm loading a distric, trying to customise my character, or just running around. I like the feel of the game, it's like Grand Theft Auto but a cooler concept. I like all the different options there are when customising characters, cars, hairstyles .. etc!  Maybe something can be done about the random Client Crashes, and then i'd give this a better recommendation and a better review. But as of now ... if you can tolerate having to keep rebooting the game .. then go ahead give this game a try.
1088	1	a	I love the game ;) spent 1210 Hours on it and i didnt regret it. You can't say that about evrygame all the haters who this apb sucks just don't know how to play yet give it a week If you're not in love with it... well then u just lame af ;)
1090	1	a	the game itself is addictive but asia server(han) is nearly dead.  i haven't seen anyone play fightclub yet tbh most ppl online i've seen is around 300 while eu server(citadel) is 1000
1092	1	a	Everyone hates Everyone. team mates hate team mates, enemys hate enemys. seriously feuds are a common occurance in this game.
1094	1	a	I would have to say, the customization in this game is WAY better than GTA 5. By a long shot  I think this game deserves a thumb up because:  - It adds a compeitive feeling.  - The customization is unlimited. You can pretty much customize everything.  - The graphics are great and beat some games that are newer than APB  Cons -   - Since the game has been out for so long, people have more OP weapons. Or they buy them from ARMAS Market  - We've been playing the same missions for five years. Please add more,  - Some character issues like your eyes not moving, No jiggle bones on b()()bs.  - Some other small bugs.
1096	1	a	Uninstall works very nicely.
1098	1	a	Rly nice game :))
1100	1	a	I've sinked some hours into this game and I could still sink more, but now I am resisting this urge util they update their Soon™ engine which by the looks of it might never come, but hey game is preety fun specialy if you play with friends!  It has unique character customization which I'd love to see in other games too, maybe it could have more shapes and other tools at customization but current ones are already dope. Same goes with car customization.  Gameplay wise this game can get preety damn random at times. Physics.exe stopped working and such...  Apart from some shady people and cheaters every now and then (well it's free to play game what did you expect) it's preety damn good 3rd person shooter.  Even tho I've spend quite some cash on this game I can say it's not really Pay 2 Win since you can easily beat most of those players with guns obtainable by just leveling contacts, I've done that manytimes. If you get called noob because you use let's say NFAS don't worry it's just your opponent you shouldn't feel sorry for him! Just shoot his ♥♥♥ up and watch him RQ if he's too childish and can't accept the fact that it's just a gun in game.  Nuff with non-sense.  I'd rate this game 9/10. Best freaking time I've spent on game, with casual raging every now and then.
1102	1	a	APB was a Good Game like 2 years ago now is totally crap :)
1104	1	a	APB Reloaded is a Free-To-Play TPS game held by Gamersfirst. You'll play as a 'policeman' or as a criminal, and your aim will be to complete missions in order to increase your strength in the roads of San Paro, the city where the game settle in. This game has a lot of merits and a lot of defects:  Merits: -The game mechanics are good: the missions are pretty accurate and, sometimes, long, and you'll find to effectively play as a 'policeman' or as a criminal, thanks to the storyline of the missions. -Good graphics  Merits/Defects: -Extremely possibility of customization: you can customize cars and characters literally as you want, but if you aren't a premium player you won't be able to do a REAL good work about this. -There are a lot of guns, but half of these must be bought in order to be used (even some not-premium guns, that have only a different aspect), and I think that would be great if we would be able to use at least the not-premium ones.  Defects: -Missions are pretty the same. -There are A LOT OF cheaters, and there aren't good countermeasures to solve this problem. There are also A LOT OF P2W players, and this is very sad for new players or inexperienced ones. There's also a lot of flame! -A portable computer isn't enough to play this game: is slightly heavy in terms of framerate. -There's occasionally a lot of lag. -You need A LOT OF patience to increase the level of your player: actually there are 255 levels, and I assure you, you'll spend thousands of hours to reach the maximum level.  In the end, is hard to choose if this is a good game or not: personally I like it, so I'll recommend this game, but only for players that like TPS games and that have a lot of patience about cheaters, Pay2Win players and the slow progression in the game.
1106	1	a	Game blows cheat or quit if u are pro and stomp everyone u get banned anyway
1108	1	a	Great game to kill some time. It is more af a pay-to-advance (similar to League of Legends) than pay to win. Customization is very high and the community isn't half bad.    8/10
1110	1	a	A really nice game, playing as a Bad or Nice cop or playing as a Badass Crime. Fully customizeable character guns and cars. Free to play makes it 20x times better, monthly/yearly events earning new stuff makes it better. I really recommend this game playing with friends, clans etc.
1112	1	a	Why do you want to play this game? Do you want to have some fun, customize your own character or vehicle as you want and have something that differs you from another player? Then this game is made for you! Let's say, APB got best customization ever, it's better than any other games. I recommend this game, because simply, it's the best!
1114	1	a	great game and lagfest , you must try
1116	1	a	Very underrated, don't let the mixed reviews fool you.  It's a free game, what's there to not like? (Unless you want to chip in a couple £££ to actually be able to win but shh)
1118	1	a	It's kinda like Just Cause 2 multiplayer but with missions and it's way more realistic. It's still not realistic but you know. It's alright, there's a lot of unique features that make it different from games like Saints Row and GTA. It's pretty fun while it lasts but I'm not sure how long that'll be.
1120	1	a	APB: Reloaded is a unique game in a era where most games feel like every other one. While the game may have some technical problems, the developers are working hard to remedy them and overall improve the quality of the game. I've played the game since its first beta under Real Time Worlds in 2009, and there is good reason that it hasn't faded into the past as so many other games have.  The mission portion of the game is structured so that it seems different almost every time, and you don't get that feeling of repetition that you get with a lot of arena-style shooters. (CoD, Battlefield, Blacklight) You may get the same mission objectives, but the game randomizes the locations, your opponents and your teammates (if you don't have a premade group) throughout the zone each time.  Combat works as intended, and while it may not be the most modern shooter the game has a lot to offer on the battlefield. The gunplay is smooth and tactical thinking and teamwork can win over even the most skilled opponents. Having a good team working together is one of the best parts of this game.  There is also, of course, the customization. There is no game on the market today that allows you to be unique in the way that this game does. From making stylish threads, music and cars for yourself to making uniforms and patrol vehicles for your clan-mates, you can truly create your own identity here.  The game is a bit old, granted, with a somewhat outdated version of Unreal Engine and a lot of custom code at its core. I'm hopeful, however, as the developers have an overhaul and upgrade planned for the game's engine. According to the timeline it should be ready for testing by the end of the first quarter 2014, and all reports state that development is currently on schedule.  See you on the streets!

1124	1	a	ALL THEY DO IS BANG
1126	1	a	Yes, wish there was more cops and robber type stuff instead of just random gunfights for missions.
1128	1	a	Maybe they should call this game Memory Leak Reloaded instead rolf

1132	1	a	Narcissists and hypocrites everywhere. 10/10
1134	1	a	Is a very very good game!
1136	1	a	playing this game for 4 years. really good game but G1 need to fix some stuff to make this game better
1138	1	a	♥♥♥♥♥♥♥it EA. 5/10  What had the potential to be one of the best shooter MMOs ever made, became a cheater infested Pay2Win game. The game is nice, no question. It has a ton of potential - one that 'Gamersfirst' (lol its obviously moneyfirst) doesn´t even scratch at.  The character customization possibilites are incredibly huge. You can almost spend hours in these menus. So there´s a huge plus to this game. Unfortunately, all that doesn´t help you when the game frustrates the hell out of any legit player who doesn´t want to pay real money for already present ingame content.  The graphics are okay. The gameplay is okay. The movement is quite smooth and the gun handling is also nice. Not too easy, nor too difficult.  Why the game isn´t recommendable for anyone who wants to play it seriously: I can say that you will encounter your first cheater within your first five matches and that statement will come true in probably 80% of all cases.  I can also tell you that skills don´t matter in this game, because the other guy who paid real money for skills and perks and weapons and equipment and whatnot, will crush you.  The game is fun, as long as you aren´t serious about it. Driving around in cars with your friends sticking out their weapons from the windows or doors, robbing stores, mugging people, annoying the hell out of other players and doing all kinds of stupid things with friends really does have quite a nice charm to it.

1144	1	a	Fun but its kinda laggy and unpolished otherwise FUN
1146	1	a	Apb Reloaded is a fast pace PVP game. Its supposed to be atleast. The game Has many different customizations so your character will hardly looks the same as the guy next to you (usually). Ther are also many car customizations. There are a few cars but not so many. Ther are a few guns but they hardly introduce new guns, its usually the original guns with buffed statts and etra mods for it. There is not an anti cheat engine. Less Hackers = More fun. There will obviously still be hackers but there is alot less hackers. This game is easy for people who have a good aim with good reactions and a good pc. I run this with about 15 fps, smallest res and min graphics. I wouldnt be writing this review if i hated it. I LOVE this game so much and i reccomend it to everyone. People Claim that this game is Pay to Win. This game is NOT pay to win. Everythign can be unlocked or bought of the in game auction market in the Social district. The game now has a tutorial which if completed, You can pick a permanent weapon instead of payign for one. People pay monet to this game for an extra edge but it only comes down to skill (apart from people with a launcher :P) ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 10/10 Fave Game in my steam Libary (yet not played alot XD YOLO SWAG)
1148	1	a	This is quite honestly the best game you'll ever play that is truely free. It has Pay2Win elements, but none of it is absolutely required, and if you buy just one thing you get a ton of perks, because you become a 'premium' member. This is a common approach for F2P games, but the benefits in this one are insane. Customization is top notch along with gameplay. name one other game where you can paint your car all by yourself. That's what I thought. This game also gets a WaterSlap seal of approval at 10/10
1150	1	a	TL;DR Good game with not as good community.  APB Reloaded is a game based on an awesome idea - a GTA-like MMO shooter with incredible customization. While the game isn't perfect, in my opinion the developers ended up closer to success than fail in making that idea happen. The game itself is fun, as long as you know what it is, and what it isn't. And it isn't a realistic tactical shooter - it's a purely arcade game, with simple hitboxes, no headshots, guns that need to shoot you several times to kill you, cars that can kill you even if you jump over their body (but not the hitbox) etc. Amount of illogical things in this game is ridiculous, but once you know them and look at APB not as a simulator, but a set of rules, it can be really fun. The biggest problem though is the community.  Every account has a 'threat' based on how good you do in missions - you're either bronze, silver or gold. This is based solely on your performance - it doesn't matter how much you have unlocked or how long are you playing. Servers are divided into 90 slot districts dedicated to those threats, so in theory gold players play on gold districts, silver players on silver districts etc. It doesn't really work like that though. Most golden districts are empty, and most silver districts are flooded with gold players that often kick silver players from teams as soon as they join, since if teams are imbalanced, the game finds a player to balance them. I've seen a lot of players kicking silvers until they get a gold teammate and many others actually complaining that silver players should go on bronze servers and leave silver servers for them (!). This can make the game really unpleasant if you get kicked 4-5 times in a row. Oh, I forgot - if you go on a server for lower threat, you get lower rewards. So there's that. Even if you don't get kicked, the matchmaking isn't great, taking only threat into account and matching, for example, new players against those with exceptiona gear.  The game is also said to be infested by hackers, but that's exaggerated a lot - yes, there are some hackers, expoliters etc, but you'll encounter problems explained above much more often than any cheaters.  The game itself is fun even though mentioned problems. You can customize everything, from the way your character looks, to it's clothing, to the car you own. You can put decals/tattoos on pretty much everything. Weapons are quite balanced, and the game isn't really pay to win, more grind to win, as weapons you can buy with real cash are as good as those you can buy ingame - you just need to unlock them first.  The game can be annoying, but it can be even more fun, and IMO it's worth playing for those fun moments.
1152	1	a	this game made my comp blu screen on a hourly basis 10/10
1154	1	a	APB Reloaded is a great game.  8/10
1156	1	a	Pros: Great Gameplay, Great customization clothes to vehicle to body tattoo. All guns have different recoil which is why you'll have to try and see what gun suits you best. Every vehicles have different handles.    Cons: The Pay to Win system. but yes you can buy gun through in game for 30 days but the one at store are a lot stronger and have more mods. Cars parts, you have to buy them. some clothes you also have to buy them especially the events one and new ones, i doubt they'll add anything to the clothes unlock for free now. Matchmaking is bad as well   Overall i like the game with it's customization well done. Feels like GTA Online .
1158	1	a	A decent freetoplay mmo, hard to find a character name that has not been taken but appart from that i would recommend it to everyone who likes open world mmo games
1160	1	a	it's the essence of a b u t t h o l e , which is apparently a censored word.
1162	1	a	This game is very very very pay to win. If you don't mind getting ♥♥♥♥♥ in game for your first, I don't know, 300 hours then it won't be too much of a problem.  But if you rage easily and hate pay to win people then this game is not for you.
1164	1	a	FIRST AND FAR MOST DONT READ THE @!#&amp;@#@!) BAD REVIEW.ITS ABOUT YOU WANT TO PLAY THE GAME AND BASED ON IT EITHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT.I LIKE IT CAUSE ITS A BALANCE GAME WHERE YOU DONT NEED TO PAY TO PLAY THE GAME.I PLAY THIS FROM NEWBIE TO A HIGH RANK PLAYER WITH OUT BUYING ANYTHING FROM ARMAS WHICH IS THERE MARKET TO BUY STUFF FOR THE GAME (I DID BUY SOME CLOTHES BUT NOTHING ELSE :3 )STRAIGHT TO TE POINT THIS GAME IS DIFFERENT FROM OTHER GAMES CAUSE YOU MAYBE WONT FINE SOMETHING LIKE WHAT THIS GAME OFFER SO ITS YOUR OPINION TO PLAY IT OR NOT.  DONT #@!#$%&amp; RELATED THIS GAME TO GTA 5 EVEN IT HAVE THAT LOOK ITS HAVE DIFFERENT TYPE OFF GAMEPLAY :P WHY I CAPS LOCK THIS SO ITS #@!!@$@ ♥♥♥♥ING STAND OUT FROM THE OTHER REVIEW.
1166	1	a	Cheap mans grand theft auto. Soild
1168	1	a	This game is very like Gta 5, i like it, its a good game!
1170	1	a	Sold my 110$ csgo knife to buy a car...I have no idea why, i just felt like i want better car. ( rip money, p2w, hacking, also sometimes u actually encounter good enemies, jk ******* hackers.   10/10 will waste money again.  Download it can provide hours of gameplay, first 80 hours will be fun. 
1172	1	a	I like the customization. Thats about it.
1174	1	a	i love this game &lt;3 
1176	1	a	Great game if you're willing to spend at least $20 on it.
1178	1	a	Gonna love how all the idiots say this is P2W. It is HARD to understand that the paid weapons are just RESKINS of the normal weapons? It even says so in their ♥♥♥♥ing description and on the wiki. Everyone just comes and reviews after 20hrs not getting ♥♥♥♥ about this game. Funny.  This game is GOOD. It is fun, and brings tons of activites you can do solo or with friends. In terms of PvP, you need strong nerves to play it. If you get slightly frustrated by stupidities outside this game, you will not enjoy APB.   Thanks for downvoting my review, but after hitting that thumb down button go check the wiki for the so-called 'paid-weapons' you are so much crying about.
1180	1	a	Good game. Fun. May be innapropriate for younger players ;)
1182	1	a	this is a fun game you go around and shoot ppl stell cars play as a cop or a crook XD its pirtty fun sorda reminds me of gta :D hope some of u guys get it glhf :D
1184	1	a	pretty fun game, i like how you can either be an enforcer of the law or a criminal *starts playing aint no place for the wicked* i mostly play as a criminal
1186	1	a	I enjoyed running about customising my car but then i figured i could do a custom paintjob by cumming all over my car, nice a and white all over even though it was black before, i left a special message in every bullet i shot as i a came in a magazine everytime i reloded just like the game intended, reloaded its such a great jerk off if you know what i mean
1188	1	a	.
1190	1	a	It's funny how Gamerslast spelled their name wrong
1192	1	a	Great way to past time really with friends this denf a squad game. c;
1194	1	a	APB Reloaded is GTA 5 on steroids and is Free To Play as welll so i would advise everyone to try this game even if you dont like games like this its still fun.   What Willl You Choose  Enforcer or Criminal
1196	1	a	Go ahead and play this game.  You will soon find out why players that only spend 40 hours on the game like it and why the players that have logged over 800 hours hate it.      Note: This game is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome; It has so much potential- It just has the world's ♥♥♥♥♥iest Dev's I have ever seen.
1198	1	a	noice game for cheaters
1200	1	a	Im sure the game is dieing but when i played it back then *like 2 years ago* it was fun to run aound and steal ♥♥♥♥.
1202	1	a	yup its awesome
1204	1	a	good game now ive got a new gaming pc !!!!! playing on a big screen looks amazing !!!!! 
1206	1	a	one hell of a amazing game! it it a bit comfusing at the start but it will get easyer  they should have a ranking system so you cant get in as a noob and meeting a pro that has played over a year    9/10
1208	1	a	+Good for killing time :D +free xD +some events  = hard for newbie  -imba legendary gun -theres some cheater around :'(  overall : 7.5 out of 10
1210	1	a	One of those games I download every year or so, play for 5 minutes, then delete again. I love it.
1212	1	a	I don't know what to say about this game besides it's amazing, so here is a recipe for pancakes,   Ingredients:  4tbsp plain flour (about 100g) 1 large free range egg ½ pint semi-skimmed milk + water (about 300ml - ¾ milk ¼ water) Pinch of salt Butter for frying How to make pancakes: Sieve the flour and salt into a large bowl and make a well in the mixture.  Break in the egg and stir to make a breadcrumby mix.  In a jug add 1/3 of a pint of milk and top up with water to make 1/2 a pint (200ml milk, 100ml water) - this makes a lovely light batter.  Add the milk and the water mix bit by bit, beating constantly to avoid lumps.  Tip:*If you have a food processor just throw all the ingredients in and zap until smooth!  Pop a large frying pan over a medium heat.  Add a large knob of butter (roughly 50g) and melt.  Pour the excess butter into a small bowl and reserve it for later.  Using a ladle pour a spoonful of the pancake batter into the hot pan and swirl to get a full covering - cook for about 1 min each side (it's ready when it's easy to flip over).
1214	1	a	This game has the best customization ever! Gameplay is fun too!  If you like character customization you must try this game out (it's limited for f2p users but you can get promo codes wich gives premium)  I have over 3000h+ in this game (i played with out steam)  10/10 uniq game in every aspect
1216	1	a	Best free to play ever created reminds me a lot of gta san andreas online like back in the day a huge cops and robbers simulator 100/100 would recommend to anyone.
1218	1	a	Fun game but you need to have a lot of patience.Sometimes the matchmaking makes you compete against players that are much better than you.I ragequited so many times but still its really fun :P
1220	1	a	The game is actually great but it has a few ( i mean lots of) bugs and also many people believe that this game is pay to win but we hope they've fix bugs and make game more easier to play for new players. Also this game has lots of options for character and car designing that allows you to create everything you can imagine. (i kinda love and kinda hate this game)
1222	1	a	The best Steam F2P game i've ever played.  It's like saints row but in an online world.
1224	1	a	I like to play apb is so nc to past your time Xd
1226	1	a	I've had many experiences throughout my years of gaming, but hell, APB Reloaded is one of the up-most innovative Action MMO Third Person Shooter games I've ever played. The level of custominization through out the game is uncomparable to any other MMO Shooter games out there. To elaborate on the custimization, it leaves the player with custimization of clothing, character, vehicles, graffiti, themes, songs, etc... giving a sense of uniqueness.The threat system and server districts needs much improvement and generalization. The marketplace in Social District could use spiffs and improvements for more player interface and player amplification. The currect sever status of APB Reloaded (11/26/2015) is unsuitable and inadequate that most players are recieving 200+ latency which is causing various issues throughout the game such as Lag, Rubber-banding, etc... It's fairly optimized for gaming pc's, but needs improvements for low-graphic gaming set-ups. The global community of APB is atrocious and topmost annoying, but there's always a /ignore and discharge options for the district chats. Over all, APB is enjoyable, amusing, and visionary which leaves me rating it at a 7.5/10.
1228	1	a	i like the game its awesome
1230	1	a	its ok. if you start new now its really hard to git gud
1232	1	a	Made a van and put 'FREE CANDY' on the side. I'm a cop. They'll never suspect a thing..   10/edgy criminals
1234	1	a	Cancer Game.
1236	1	a	THIS IS THE BEST GAME ON THE PLANET. WHEN I'M NOT SURE MY 'F' KEY IS WORKING I ALWAYS LOAD UP MY FAVORITE TESTING PLATFORM, APB. WHEN LIFE IS GREAT AND I NEED TO BE BROUGHT DOWN A BIT I ENJOY A GAME FULL OF PAY TO WIN, EXPLOITING, AND BUILT-IN ANTI FUN MECHANICS THAT MAKE SURE THAT YOU ARE THROWING YOUR MOUSE OUT THE WINDOW BY THE END OF THE NIGHT.  10/10.
1238	1	a	Great game, just hard to get going when you start. Although after a long time of playing this game I've gotten pretty good. It has a good skill curve to achieve. If any newcomers need help learning the game, shoot me a messege in-game (HeartOfGold) or steam. we need more players, as the game is dying,
1240	1	a	free gta with lots of DLC
1242	1	a	Basically it's saints row 3 online
1244	1	a	This game is flawed, but I still can't get enough of the damn thing.  Let's start with the graphics. They look good, not the best I've seen, but they look good and avoid uncanny valley. The animation is done well and the frame rate stays at a decent level, on my end anyway. I will say that for a few minutes when I first start it up, it does lag though. I'll be driving my car and all of a sudden be another block down the road, or in a pile of wreckage I don't remember being in half a second ago.  The social aspect is great. Most of the other players I've come across are courteous and personable, but still offer a challenge on missions. While there are occaisional hackers, they can be taken out, contrary to popular belief. It's not by any means easy, but it is possible. I will say that the armas marketplace is flawed. That and auctions. The armas forces you to have paid currency, which I cannot afford. While there might be a way to earn that for free, I don't know what that way is.  The driving is done really well. It splits the difference between arcade style and realistic into a challenging and fun way to quickly get around. I really like how the different types of cars have different handling, speed, etc. I do wish the cars were more affordable though. The one I want is $400000 in the in-game currency. I do like the customization you can do with cars, though. I have a couple anime-looking cars and a fun police car(yes, it has fun police symbols on it. It's amazing).  The character customization is one of the most in depth things I've seen in a game, next to maybe Skyforge and Skyrim. Ignoring Spore, as that's less customization and more straight up creation. But the character customizer in this game is so in depth, that I haven't seen two characters in the game that look exactly alike(If two players wanted to play as twins though, that would be really cool to see). The story is also loose enough that you can think of your own backstory to your character, if you like.  Now, for my big issues with the game.  There is a button to hide the HUD, which I've used a lot, but there doesn't seem to be a free cam mode, which is unfortunate. I'd be using that for screenshots pretty much all the time.  When I actually get into the game, it doesn't show on Steam, I don't know if anyone else is having this problem, but I've put 20+ hours into the game and it shows as &lt;30 minutes on my profile. That also means I can't access the Steam Community within the game, and I can't take screenshots in which I can share with the community. I post my stuff I've used Ctrl+Prt Sc with on social media, but I can't do anything other than that. The anti-cheat should be quite a bit better, so legit players like me don't get screwed over by a team of hackers(Because that really is impossible to stop by players). Either prices in the marketplaces should be reduced or in-game money should be more abundant. It's annoying to have to play for hours on end to get a couple measely items. There should be facial presets, for people who have trouble with the character customizer and want a good look for their character's face.   But, if you like open-world MMO's and MOBA style shooters, I reccomend this game, as it's like a combination of the two.
1246	1	a	╭☞ ͡ ͡° ͜ ͡ ͡°)╭☞   \ . .\   \ \   / ╰u╯\  It's ok.
1248	1	a	Greate game!!!
1250	1	a	It's nice, but you have to have a goot network connection and a very powerful PC... :/
1252	1	a	This is THE BEST GAMER e¤vryvaiubn RIPWHESYFRHG
1254	1	a	Find this game more addictive than crack cocaine for some reason. After all, it is a healthier alternative if you don't want to get multiple health risks associated with crack cocaine. Now time for me to get back to the game and start to yell random cusswords at the monitor. ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ DAMN.
1256	1	a	Classic GTA gameplay goes MMO!
1258	1	a	Its alright...
1260	1	a	A great game with guns, explosives, and cool looking cars with a unique cusomization
1262	1	a	i reccomend this game because it lets do run around do missions and buy clothes and tatoos and also weapons in this game at the start you choose a faction ei character ther ENFORCERS or CRIMINALS and then you customize your character then you play it is an awesome game and you should get it now whilst it is free! :)
1264	1	a	If you're even slightly good at this, you're a hacker. 10/10
1266	1	a	♥♥♥♥ 10/10
1268	1	a	Best f2p game ever unless you suck at shooters, and if that is the case then get on my level scrub. Top lel.
1270	1	a	Definately has a GTA feel to it, but with insane customization, while it is fun to play free, I would 100% reccomend buying premium, however, G1, the company that owns the game, is completly money hungry as well as a tad ♥♥♥♥♥♥ as far as sever connection goes, but even with this, it is still a game that is very addictive, and very fun!
1272	1	a	Fun game, terrible servers, dont expect the servers to get better...ever.
1274	1	a	love the game its has alot of potential, but i think it would be better as a pay up front game insted of a subscription i would be happy to spend 30 on this game if it was.
1276	1	a	It's a good pastime game if anything. I've played it extensively, so I can say it takes time to unlock/buy decent gear. Once your favourite gear is unlocked though, there's not much more to this game. It gets repetitive after a while.  But... it's free. And if you like games like GTA or Saints Row, this might be a good multiplayer substitute for you. Teamwork and good planning gets you through most battles with a victory, so if you have friends to play with, your chances of having fun and making quick progress increases a lot.  Otherwise, get ready to grind over and over, and perhaps blame people for using hacks when it could actually be so that the enemy team uses communication to pinpoint targets while your team does not.  Good range of weapons, and variety of weapons within the same weapon class, such as multiple brands of shotguns, assault rifles, sniper rifles, pistols and even rocket launchers and grenade launchers.    Overall, I rate this game 7/10.  
1278	1	a	Not played it alot but seems fun with so much customization. I will spend 30 hours creating my character
1280	1	a	Pros. Free Not Call of Duty  Cons. Overpriced DLC 
1282	1	a	Certainly isn't what it used to be or could have been, but I'd say its still worth a shot.
1284	1	a	NIce
1286	1	a	Great game, free.. unfortunately, plenty of spammers and hackers. All the good stuff is bought from the store or takes forever to get.
1288	1	a	 55 
1290	1	a	Had the best moments with my friends. Rage moments , Funny moments , i recommend this game because is just awesome. But the community is not so good. Have fun with it !
1292	1	a	This is my most played game, it is outstanding for a free to play game. With the size and variety of the virtual the city of San Paro, there is little repetition. It is the free GTA.
1294	1	a	Wow its Gta iv :P
1296	1	a	Apb Reloaded is a fast pace PVP game. Its supposed to be atleast. The game Has many different customizations so your character will hardly looks the same as the guy next to you (usually). Ther are also many car customizations. There are a few cars but not so many. Ther are a few guns but they hardly introduce new guns, its usually the original guns with buffed statts and etra mods for it. There is not an anti cheat engine. Less Hackers = More fun. There will obviously still be hackers but there is alot less hackers. This game is easy for people who have a good aim with good reactions and a good pc. I run this with about 15 fps, smallest res and min graphics. I wouldnt be writing this review if i hated it. I LOVE this game so much and i reccomend it to everyone. People Claim that this game is Pay to Win. This game is NOT pay to win. Everythign can be unlocked or bought of the in game auction market in the Social district. The game now has a tutorial which if completed, You can pick a permanent weapon instead of payign for one. People pay monet to this game for an extra edge but it only comes down to skill (apart from people with a launcher :P) ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 10/10 Fave Game in my steam Libary (yet not played alot XD YOLO SWAG)
1298	1	a	Although like most game's this game is free to play but you have to buy stuff with real money, but It is a good Sandbox and almost like a free GTA. I may have not played the game that much I still love it when I do
1300	1	a	well i haven't play this game before but i watched it on youtube and go type the channel who make the apb reloaded video is rapid99apb police chase on youtube type it there and you can like talk to people make friends shoot enemies and all that kind of stuff you can drive all the day's work of san paro and you can shoot criminials i must have said it already but oh well thats the support i need bye
1302	1	a	its alright ya feel
1304	1	a	Only about 14 hours in right now but it is an alright game. Character creation and customization is awesome!! The attention to detail for tats, cars, characters and clothes is fantastic and can be intricate.  Down side, players aren't cooperative or friendly and most are not much fun to play with. Right off the bat you mark yourself 'ready' since there isn't much else to do and BAM! Your dead, hope you learn faster. All in all thought I recommend it. It is a GTA style with two factions and without premium, that leaves you to make two characters with one in each faction to have fun with. I keep it as a fallback game and enjoy it most of the time.
1306	1	a	Best Multiplayer game there ever was. Gamerfirst are trying their hardest to make it a ♥♥♥♥ game and it's still fun,
1308	1	a	This is quite honestly the best game you'll ever play that is truely free. It has Pay2Win elements, but none of it is absolutely required, and if you buy just one thing you get a ton of perks, because you become a 'premium' member. This is a common approach for F2P games, but the benefits in this one are insane. Customization is top notch along with gameplay. name one other game where you can paint your car all by yourself. That's what I thought. This game also gets a WaterSlap seal of approval at 10/10
1310	1	a	This is a game, were when you play it for a bit, you stop and uninstall. Only to find yourself reinstalling it later wanting to play it again.
1312	1	a	it is an ok game still needs a lot of work but all in all i still give it credit
1314	1	a	if you aint playing apb, honestly i dont know what you doin.
1316	1	a	best game ever &lt;3 can they please release APB 2 i bet it would be the daddy of all games
1318	1	a	its a good game but im too lazy to write a detailed review dont pay attention to the people who say its pay to win give it 10 hours and if u still dont like it dont play it
1320	1	a	get this game 
1322	1	a	This game is a very good game, I have found countless times bored and played this Game and enjoyed it, you don't need to packs to enjoy blowing stuff up!!
1324	1	a	even though i get frustrated at the hackers, and people who are better than me, its still a fun game to play. it helps when i need to get rid of some anger, but usually after my anger is spent i get some more just by playing.
1326	1	a	I play this game to drive around in a car and listen to my music. Which I can not do in the real world.
1328	1	a	straight up fun
1330	1	a	This game is terrible.
1332	1	a	gta multiplayer for people who like to be confused and die too much but it is free
1334	1	a	Fun but its kinda laggy and unpolished otherwise FUN
1336	1	a	she wants the D.

1344	1	a	This Is An Amazing Game!!! Play It!
1346	1	a	Fun game to play lone wolf or with a few friends. Long wolf you'll be play with others regardless. With friends communications will help you a lot, which is a given. Unlimited ways to customise your character, clothes, cars, symbols and themes. 9/10 imo

1352	1	a	I like this game
1354	1	a	Terrible game if you want to actually unlock stuff (fast atleast), but if you aim to just do ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ like i do wih my friends, this is an awesome game.   Even though the combat mechanics suck, the level of customization, and freedom in the game is truely awesome.  Customization 10/10  Being able to do stupid ♥♥♥♥ 10/10  Taking this game seriously 6/10
1356	1	a	First off, i got to mention some negativ aspects of the game:  1. If you are new to the game, paying will instantly win you more missions, which is sad. 2. The Community is sometimes very toxic, calls you a hacker etc. just for playing good. 3. The Game rewards you for paying for the premium status (f.e. with the more money after missions) 4. Some people dont enjoy the graphics and the way the game feels  But those are just the negativ points that i have been confronted with alot. On the other hand, there are quit some good experiences ive made so far.  1. You can easily take out high rank players or paying players just with pure skill, since the game offers a big area of skillrequires with positionings, weaponchoices, mapknowledge, parcouring etc. 2. The way you can be creative with the outfits, cars etc. is REALY fantastic in the combination with the entire GTA-ish feeling (and yes, you can get more customize slots for premium, but there are free redeemcodes, events etc. in which you can get your hand on the premium status for 1-2+ days in which you can use all the time you got to create ur own perfect outfit) 3. You can freely customize your weapon after unlocking better versions with customizable slots, which makes your weapon choice even more situational and more interesting in terms of differences 4. The game offers you gigantic rewards for playing long enough, like giant ♥♥♥ weapons, grenade launchers etc, which might seem to be overpowered, but everyone can get their hands on them, so its pretty fair and not everyone uses them due to the massiv difficulty to land them propperly. 5. You can have ALOT of fun with the physics, even though the most fun is getting earned by using some buggs with the trucks, teamsystems etc. 6. The way the game feels is just incredibly fun, even though you can get sometimes frustrated, the game offers you ALOT of fun, creativity, skillbased rewards etc.  I would recommend getting APB Reloaded, even though it has some downsides which get (in my opinion) outweightet by the good sides of the game, which i think are amazing.
1358	1	a	For a free to play game this is fantastic, while i have some complaints overall its really good, much potential
1360	1	a	Best Game Ever!!!  .... Not because i like... It's because i Love it!!!   :D
1362	1	a	One of the best F2P games I have played.
1364	1	a	It's a very nice game , after playing 100 hours i decided to make a review : - You can get a very good car without paying money for g1c , you just do the daily missions - It's very cool that there are a lot of events for Christmass   It's a game 10/10
1366	1	a	A very enjoyable game. The world feels alive with players, dynamic and full; most of the time. I did at time find myself unable to join any kind of activity but for the most part this was not a problem. Although the movement, shooting and combat feels fast and mobile there is still a great deal of tactical and strategic depth, with planing and thoughtful positioning being just as impotent as good reflexes. It did at times feel repetitive, and progression did feel slow and I found myself asking 'What exactly was I working towards again?'   Pay to win? A little, but a good player and still put a premium player in their place with a little skill and intelligent planing. One of the thinks that did annoy me was the fact that I could only rent weapons, and all I seemed to really own was the perks that can be attached to them.  Over all a very fun game that made me feel as if I was a valuable member of a larger team, and after some time I felt I had become proficient and confident in my own play style and enjoyed coming up with intelligent ways to defeat more skilled and better armed players with by good strategy. Reading the battle is perhaps one of the most important skills in this game and allows you to made a difference to the fight without simply racking up kills.  It's free, so give it a try because it's worthy you time.
1368	1	a	I like the customization. Thats about it.
1370	1	a	Some games, I just wish were reality... Needless to say this is one on them...
1372	1	a	Played it, loved it, 9/10..
1374	1	a	This is a great game to play if you like: -MMOs -Open World Games -TPSs(Third Person Shooters) -Costumizable Game Cars, Characters, and Weapons  I give this game a 4/5, because the servers have a tendancy of disconnecting you. But, otherwise this is a great game, .......................,,-~*~,, ......................./:.:.:.:.:.| ......................|;.;.;.;.;./ ......................|.;.;.;.;.| ............._,,,,,_.).;.;.;.;.| .........,,-':.:.:.:.'~-,;.;.;.| ........(_,,,,---,,_:.:.);.;.;..',, ......,-':.:.:.:.:.''-,,/;.;.;.;.;.', .....(:.__,,,,,,,,,___);.;.;.;.;.;| ...../'':.:.:.:.:.:.:¯''\;.;.;.;.;.,' ....\',__,,,,,,,,,,,__/;;;;;;;;;/\ .....\.::.:.:.:.:.:.:.;.);;;;;;;;;/:\ .......\,,,,,---~~~~;;;;;;;;,'::::\ ..........'''~~--,,,,,,,,,,-'::::::::::\
1376	1	a	This game is awsome because its free. It works fine with low end pcs and it is fun for you and your friends
1378	1	a	Fun when not having to deal with server/lag issues
1380	1	a	I still find it a miracle that this game is free. It is incredibly fun and has awesome graphics. Its multiplayer so I can enjoy time completing missions with my friends, but make sure you're a bad guy I find it more fun :).
1382	1	a	BE WARNED! A lot of the community in this game is full of complainers, asshats, hackers, and hackusators - Eventhough you rarely see the hackers - As is common in any Game made by Gamers First (G1) becaause they never get taken care of.  But anyway, the customization in this game is unmatched, when you create your character no one will have a similar styling as yours. The gameplay overall is OK, nothing to get all excited about. You can have fun with it, but do bring friends with you cause it will make it that much more enjoyable. But I cannot say that this game is not fun, as you can see by the many hours I've logged in.  Customizing as a free to play player in this game is one of the most annoying things you will have to deal with because (not including character customization) everything for the free to play guys is limited. And alot of store content (Armas Store) is overly priced in my opinion for what this game looks like it's worth, NOTHING.  This game in my opinion could really need an overhaul its' absolute everything, it could look and be so much better if the idiots at G1 would stop shoving new store items in our faces and actually WORK ON THE FRICKIN GAME! I doubt that they even look at player feedback.  I wish I could have played this back when it was owned by Real Time Worlds. The Veterans of the game are always saying how much better this was back then. I did see something in chat that startled me, that there was still one copy of this game at some Walmart that was a Real Time Worlds edition. Isn't that crazy?
1384	1	a	I love this game!!
1386	1	a	if you like gta and you do not have the money download APB reloaded it is fun to kill your frend and onlie player's  GET THE GAME A JOIN ME ON IT :D 
1388	1	a	Even though APB may get very frustrating at times because of all the hackers and pay to win players, it is a fun game. The graphics aren't bad, and you can spend hours customizing your equipment, cars, symbols, etc. The people on the American servers tend to be nice and chatty, however, the people on the European servers never communicate. It almost feels like you are playing a single-player game. Oh, and driving is difficult as hell, but you get used to it...
1390	1	a	what can i say????? well what i can say is that this game is the best game on steam! i have been palying this game since it came out and you had to pay for it to play but now that it is FREE to play! i have been spending almost 500 hrs on this game and it never gets bored atlest if you have a nice clan with nice ppls in it :) and you can design your car to look like however you want it to look wich is awesome if you know how to design that is! i suck at it ^^  I GIVE THIS GAME 10/10! Stars!  so  some ppls say it's pay 2 win but im not so sure about that!   
1392	1	a	Great game, besides the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ servers and violent community it is great overall. Made alot of friends and recommend to all.
1394	1	a	is harder than gta
1396	1	a	Great and fun Open World game
1398	1	a	This game has a insane replay value. Also a engine upgrade is in the works. But currently the servers have some lag every now and again. supposedly it'll be fixed with the engine upgrade.  Edit 3/8/2014  Seems like the majority of the lag as be taken care of. Less and less hackers with a engine upgrade a long the way. If you ever wanted to jump into this game. Now is the time!
1400	1	a	This game is so bad!
1402	1	a	love the customization in this game, its great
1404	1	a	if you aint playing apb, honestly i dont know what you doin.
1406	1	a	best game ever &lt;3 can they please release APB 2 i bet it would be the daddy of all games
1408	1	a	it's ok
1410	1	a	a truly unique game that many people are so in love with they can't stop playing even if they have to closet hack to keep up. probably the best game ever run by the worst company ever.   i'm lucky that i stayed sort of a nobody for the 3 years i've played off and on, but if you're going to play this game, commit to the long haul and you'll form lots of good memories with massive doses of frustration and rage in between.  but actually, the best part about this game is the high level of game-impact creativity. as in, if you design something, it can actually matter in the game. you could see a random person driving around a car that you made. That's cool and special. you could die and here a kill-theme you wrote, etc.
1412	1	a	This Game is super fun been playing it for the past 2 months and cant get away from it
1414	1	a	This is a great game. Its like grand theft auto
1416	1	a	Now as someone who absolutly loves this game. There is quite a bit wrong with it.   PROS: Customization 10/10:The ability to design shirts,pants,shoes,cars,etc is absolutly awesome and one of the game's biggest appeals.  Driving:6/10:While most slower cars have really good handiling but when you drive a partriot for the first time its like driving a monster-truck on ice  Freerunning/Parkour:4/10: While running,jumping,climbing ladders,kicking doors,etc is very satifing I feel there could be room for more of this as it is very fun  Weapon Varitety:8/10:The amount of weapons is very huge considering its free-to-play roots. I will touch up more on this later.  Graphics:(Dependent):For me I can run this game on 'High' Settings and It looks pretty good espically in Maximum. but when you go to minimal or low its terrible,boxy. Over all this game is about three years old so its somewhat okay for them to be a bit lower.  CONS:(alot)  Weapons:4/10:As previously mentioned the VARIETY is the good thing. even though they pretty much are useless in some combat situations SNIPERS ARE EXTREMELY OP IF YOU CAN USE THEM  Premium and other paid things:1/10:Makes the game rage-inducing and irritating when some kid who spent $60 on a 'Free-To-Play' game has everything he needs to kill someone in less than three shots,Cars with abilities are not really earned bit rather payed for. 'Pay-To-Win' More like.  Map(s):7/10:As far as maps go they are pretty good in the actual game. but however only 2 and very small at that does make it easier for missions but makes it very boring after a few hours on the same map.  Enforcers:1/10:Now this is a very well done part of the game put one of the biggest complaints is that they're to Over Powered and It's entirely true most of the time. Say you're in the middle of a shootout and you suddenly fall to the ground with the 'Task Wheel' that's right:you've been tased and you can't do anything but wait until either a) you get shot down while down. b)You get up delayed but still there or most rage inducing of all c) Getting arrested and having nothing to do but wait to see if your team mate can make it in time or you have to respawn taking you out of the fight. Did I mention they don't even have to take out a tazer? They can also witness which is also very annoying as it sends everyone in your group into a mission where say you were stealing something from a store and you see an enforcer behind you waiting. as soon as you're done and you get thrown into a mission where most likely you get killed right there or arrested. Bull. ♥♥♥♥.  Car Variety:3/10:The variety of cars is truly dissapointing as it is ONLY cars. Nothing but cars. and most you have to pay for with real cash if you want abilities  Missions:3/10:There are 3-4 major types of missions. 1) Defend:Defend a certain point until the time is up. 2) Attack:Spray,burn,hack,steal,etc and deliver something somehwere 3)Hold-an-item:Hold a certian item for anywhere from 1 minute to 10 4)Kill: Kill members of the opposing faction. Nothing changes.  Communty:2/10:Most of the people are people who spend alot of money on this game. Thus they're superior. Waaaayyyy too many cheaters.  EXPECT TO DIE ALOT. Like. Alot.  Overall. with all that is wrong with this game. still VERY fun and addictive. Fun with friends. Give it a try. if you don't like it. Too bad. TOTAL 69/90
1418	1	a	Very,Good game!
1420	1	a	PAY2WIN BUT IT FUN
1422	1	a	wicked game. like gta a little bit but you actually have an objective like 99% of the time. :(
1424	1	a	Loged in..( with steam account ) i started by creating a character...Customization is CRAZY GOOD...tattoo, lots of hairstyle and more. Got into a game and WOW..it is amazing....Big city, and lots of people online. Got myself a gun, car, cool clothing and ready to go..the amont of fun in that game is SOOOO BIG. this game deliver something i've only seen in years. it's like GTA with a TON more customization mixed in....I rate this game 9.99999999999999/10
1426	1	a	Not played it alot but seems fun with so much customization. I will spend 30 hours creating my character
1428	1	a	Pros. Free Not Call of Duty  Cons. Overpriced DLC 
1430	1	a	Certainly isn't what it used to be or could have been, but I'd say its still worth a shot.
1432	1	a	Great game, and it's FREE!!!  Celestia rating: 94/100
1434	1	a	This game wants me to be a lesbian and do meth. It also got me Ebola. I liek it!    4:20 Blaze It  Sw4G 
1436	1	a	GTA Online basically really fun with friends if anyone else plays let me know im down to play anytime!
1438	1	a	Love it or hate it, this is what you should do! Break your mouse, keyboard or monitor, the opposing team is much better, have the best respawns, nearest of the objectives, they don't miss any shot, wait, i died behind wall, oh my god, they know where i came from! HACK!.
1440	1	a	APB reloded its a good game you can play with friends and have fun
1442	1	a	Fun ♥♥♥ game but damn these servers tho.
1444	1	a	its awsome game and free 
1446	1	a	Heavily P2W...But you can still have fun with game without paying anything.  Make sure you have a good PC to run this game because if not...i will feel the frame drops....  But this game is pretty fun...the character custimization in this game is amazing for a free to play game...  So yeah...Enjoy the game :)
1448	1	a	this good game ^.^
1450	1	a	APB reloaded is a pretty cool guy and doesn't afraid of anything.
1452	1	a	After playing from the original APB Real Time Worlds to GamersFirst's version, I can say that the game is broken, but not neccessarily in a bad way. It is what it is, and its a complete work-in-progress with on going updates to fix what will never be fully repaired.  With that said, the customization of character creation is really the only reason why I continue to play the game. Without that core feature I would have never put so much time and money into the game.  If I had to rate it as of now, I'd rate it a 6/10 due to how long it takes for me to be put in a mission (driving around for 10 minutes majority of the time waiting to be set against other players.) and the fact that instead of fixing things they more than less end up breaking it.  It's not a noob friendly game so if you're new to the game, hopefully you've played counter-strike 1.6 because its more 'click click' than hold down the button and hope to kill the other person.  6/10 but I still recommend anyone that likes to customize from clothes, cars, characters to music to give it a shot. Again, one of the reasons why I play this mess of a game is because past memories from RTW and customization.
1454	1	a	Went into fight club and died 13 times ina row without seeing who was shooting me or even getting an assist.  10/10 would play again.
1456	1	a	Cheeky Scrub m8.
1458	1	a	Good game  Haven't checked anything
1460	1	a	Go ahead and play this game.  You will soon find out why players that only spend 40 hours on the game like it and why the players that have logged over 800 hours hate it.      Note: This game is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome; It has so much potential- It just has the world's ♥♥♥♥♥iest Dev's I have ever seen.
1462	1	a	Haven't played too much on this account but this game might not be the best anymore, but it is like a Cops'N'Robbers take on Saints Row, and both are loved by many and in conclusion, the game now isn't bad, still a little fun hourwaster. Kinda reminds me of CrimeCraft before they took it and ♥♥♥♥ed it up with GangWars. Not a bad game. If you want a GTA-ish game, try it out!
1464	1	a	Playing online is like deleting system 32 everything is laggy , low quality and it makes you pay to over 1000$ to get your hair trimed half a centimeter but besides that the unistal process works great 12/10
1466	1	a	This game is like Grand Theft Auto V 
1468	1	a	Four men blocked the road with giant trucks FIRE SUPPORTING the entire server. 10/10.
1470	1	a	one of those games that will test how dedicated you are to WANTING to play this game. It takes time to get good. Even when your good, there always is a better player than you and it is frusterating. With that said it is a fun game once a player has become more 'sage' persay.
1472	1	a	Part of me loves this game, the other part of me HATES IT. The game has more of a Pay2win feel since alot of things require to be purchased with G1 credits, which require to be purchased with real money. Thus making the game kind of one-sided when a Free 2 play character goes up against another character who bought all of his or her weapons and items with Real life money. Those were the cons, The pros are that the game is fun when you have a nice group of friends to play the game with (Say, 4 to 5), not EVERY good weapon requires you to buy them with real life money. infact, there are quite a few decent ones that are bought with in-game money. but, the downside is they Expire in a 10-day time frame, disapearing from the player's inventory once the 10 day time period is up. The driving mechanics in the game are... meh, they could be alot beter, but they're okay. The shooting mechanics seem to be solid, the starting weapons however do not seem to be very good. it'd be a good idea to purchase a new weapon when possible.   I can't really think of much else to say here... also i am not sure if i can recommend this to people.... but i'd give the game a 6.5/10.  Also, sorry if this review seems a bit... sloppy. i never really wrote one of these before.
1474	1	a	I love this game my computer was stuffed for 3,4or5 years i couldnt play it since then
1476	1	a	Great multiplayer game.
1478	1	a	It's funny how Gamerslast spelled their name wrong
1480	1	a	I know I put recommended, but it's only really because the game is free. It is extremely pay to play/win, but there is decent gear you can get for free. I did on the whole enjoy my time playing, but when the enemies had OP ♥♥♥♥, it was EXTREMELY annoying. If you dont mind it taking quite a while to get good ♥♥♥♥, and/or spending a few bucks, its great, otherwise, play a different game.
1482	1	a	This is a fun game that has many good parts...and many bad parts. The storyline sounds great, but there are no real missions to affect the whole city like in GTA. You just do random multiplayer missions where you try to do something, such as, destroy certain cars, rob a place, etc. You and a small group within your team must go against the opposing team (the teams are Criminals and Enforcers) to cause damage or prevent it. There are many bad parts of this game too. The controls for the cars are as if you are driving on ice, and there is a special shop where you can buy AMAZING weapons for real money. This gets annoying because they do not separate the paid players from the free players when you play multiplayer, so if you play free, prepare to die often if there are many people online. I reccomend this game because, if you try to stay out of the other team's way, you can survive without paying a cent, and its really fun if you're playing with you're friends.
1484	1	a	Love the OPGL LOLOLOLOLOL and ownin noobs!
1486	1	a	The best way to try the unninstall button... IT WORKS 100% FINE
1488	1	a	I would recommend game though it is a hardcore pay to win game. I would recommend if you love games with tons of custimization this is it. If you ever get it add me I would love to play with you. You can add me at: TheWhiteNinja. Have a great day
1490	1	a	Better than second life
1492	1	a	it was overall good some bugs but I had a good time
1494	1	a	10/10 couldn't pley becuz my mum said i had no ballz.  Best uninstaller simulatorerererer.
1496	1	a	i love the custimization and i love the gameplay....its just really hard......and cheap...lol
1498	1	a	If you don't take this game seriously, you'll have a hell of a time with all the bugs, car physics, and other shenanigans. 6/10 for stupid good fun.
1500	1	a	This Game is like a fun costomizable game where you be a enforcer or cop fight with friends events all the times and I highly recommend this game because of the costomization and its like a older GTA 
1502	1	a	APB Reloaded has exemptional graphics, good game mechanics, and gives the user a great fun experience. I felt like it gets better when you play with a friend, b/c you can do missions and stuff together, and not get killed continuously. If you want a great character customization and overall good shooter, this game is for you. But, this game is a pay to win, and can be very annoying when you have a gun that you worked so hard for and someone kills you with a gun they bought. 7/10
1504	1	a	smell the america
1506	1	a	straight up fun
1508	1	a	Many lag, much anger, so mystery, wow!
1510	1	a	♥♥♥♥ing amazing, give me coins and stuff, i'm even promoting the game !!
1512	1	a	Totally best game, its like a different version of GTA V on PC :) Definently try it out guys :)
1514	1	a	try it out if u havent
1516	1	a	APB Reloaded is totally fun game and it's like GTA Online. But it's need to be add air vehicle.
1518	1	a	 First of all, I would like to say I have not spent any real money on this game. I haven't bought any DLC or In-Game Purchases.   Me and my friends really enjoy this game. We love doing missions together, and having to take down enemies. We definatley reccomend it, you don't have to pay to have fun.  Here are some reasons to try out the game -    3 Huge Maps   Ride in teamate's cars   Heaps of Character Customization   Vehicle Upgrades   Realistic Models   Crews - Paint your emblem on your car/clothes   Loads of Weapons   Fast pace shooter action   Dozens of cars to unlock and buy   Shooting out of car windows   You can smash into stores and rob them   Emotes   Good Sound FX   Play your own music in cars   You can be police and arrest people   Good amount of national servers   Alot of co-op missions against other teams   You can sometimes play missions by yourslef with no enemies   You don't need a beast computer to run it  
1520	1	a	Great game if you have a gaming computer
1522	1	a	Went into fight club and died 13 times ina row without seeing who was shooting me or even getting an assist.  10/10 would play again.
1524	1	a	Good game  Haven't checked anything
1526	1	a	Amazing game. You can compose music, design clothes, desing cars, design your character features and lots of mind blowing things inside the game. Playing the game is even more great. Districts are well desinged, quests are very colourful and enjoyable. Very strongly recommended. I haven't been so happy when playing a game before APB Reloaded.
1528	1	a	Grief trucks take skill now, but still some fun to be had. cant argue with $0
1530	1	a	I don't know what to feel about this game, but it's free so give it a try.
1532	1	a	Cool game i recomended
1534	1	a	wicked game. like gta a little bit but you actually have an objective like 99% of the time. :(
1536	1	a	Get several friends and just ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ up. The game is fun if you're willing to play it for a long time to unlock the great things.
1538	1	a	I love this game. Although it's laggy on lower-end computers and such, it is still the equivelant to the amazing grand theft auto series.
1540	1	a	PunkBuster wouldn't even let me spawn. Never had problems with false positives with Valve Anti-Cheat or other integrity programs. To be honest, I was insulted. You offend me, PunkBuster. It should be readily apparent from my lousy pointing/shooting skills in other games that I am obviously not a cheater. I say to you, PunkBuster, 'Good day.'
1542	1	a	Surprised I haven't reccomended this yet  I'll let you know, once you accept the fact that this game is an unpolished gem and it will stay that way (most likely), you're going to have lots of fun, provided you survive the learning curve  Cash shop weapons are just sidegrades, aside from one, and you can get most of them for free in-game anyway.  And for god's sake get someone to play with, it'll be hell on earth without someone you can co-ordinate with. It might not be marketed as a 'Tactical Shooter', but running in like an headless chicken will make you end up on a platter VERY quickly
1544	1	a	This isnt the same cops and robbers from when you were a kid. Constant PVP, shooting, slamming cars into each other, blowing ♥♥♥♥ up with grenaids and rocket launchers.... this is like being on speed constantly when your playing this... Quests are super fast and if you run into a-holes, you just spawn in a new instance and get back to work. Lots of fun guns to choose from, customize your wardrobe, unlock new stuff and just all out kill people.
1546	1	a	IF YOU LIKE TO BLOW UP ♥♥♥♥! THIS IS YOUR GAME ITS LIKE GTA. 
1548	1	a	awesome concept, bad as ♥♥♥♥ development and management
1550	1	a	I love it !! &lt;3
1552	1	a	APB Reloaded is a Thrid-Person Game it is a Super Good a Try it for yourself :D
1554	1	a	u play as cops or robs  lots of guns get to shoot at plpe lots of fun. i like game very mcuh recomend for all pepoels.
1556	1	a	This game is great! I highly recommend this game for anyone. This game was made by the same person who made Crackdown.
1558	1	a	Join SAN PARO now , the crazy CRIMINALS and the ENFORCERS are fighting on the streets . JOIN THE BEST SERVER -&gt; OBEYA EU1 SERVER
1560	1	a	An Awesome Game!! XD This game is just like GTA 5 basically, but just less features thats all. No lag in all servers that i have played. Really fun game when u play with friends
1562	1	a	Simply the most awesome game ever. Playing it will be a mix of fun and rage.
1564	1	a	This game is actually pretty good if you look past the cheaters, lag, pay 2 win aspect, bugs, carsurfing, poorly optimized, imbalanced guns, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ hit boxes, and terrible community.
1566	1	a	I loved uninstalling this!
1568	1	a	A very unique game with a massive customisation system focused on player created content. Design symbols using the simple to use editor to create artworks, clothing, or vehicle designs. Combat is PVP open world mission based, fast paced and challanging with a progression system and plenty of content to unlock. One of the few decent F2P games out there that isn't focused on pay to win aspects, however newer players might find the gameplay difficult and hard to understand due to the games steep learning curve.
1570	1	a	Good game. Fun. May be innapropriate for younger players ;)
1572	1	a	its a good game but im too lazy to write a detailed review dont pay attention to the people who say its pay to win give it 10 hours and if u still dont like it dont play it
1574	1	a	get this game 
1576	1	a	even though i get frustrated at the hackers, and people who are better than me, its still a fun game to play. it helps when i need to get rid of some anger, but usually after my anger is spent i get some more just by playing.
1578	1	a	+Good for killing time :D +free xD +some events  = hard for newbie  -imba legendary gun -theres some cheater around :'(  overall : 7.5 out of 10
1580	1	a	1.Install 2.Make account 3.Start playing 4.Choose to be a cop 5.Get killed by a P2P criminal 6.Uninstall  10/10 Would arrest again
1582	1	a	Asian Player Models &amp; Pay To Win Everywhere.
1584	1	a	Okay, I like this game so I'm gonna list the pros and cons:  Pros. Good graphics Smooth car handling Easy to start You can be in groups  Cons. Servers shut down frequently BlingLords with over 9000 rank try to blow/gun you down any chance they get (these people can only do this if they're in a different faction) A tiny bit confusing
1586	1	a	i honestly hope this hits the ps4
1588	1	a	I really liked this game, there is some problems with hackers but it looks like they get banned often. Combat is a little off balance but overall this is a great game.
1590	1	a	APB is a pretty fun game. There is lots of customization, cool cars you could buy, and lots of action But sooner or later you might lose interest because of frustration or the repetitive gameplay or actually both, but its a different experience for everyone so try it out and see if you like it. (btw i have 1137.8 hrs)
1592	1	a	APB Reloaded it is a very fun and unique game you pick a side the cops or the criminals both with different gameplay the criminals can rob store windows and load the stolen items into a truck and the police can chase them or the criminals can go and sell them for dirty money. I do reccomend you play this as it is is free but the only down side is that there are many hackers and it is kind of p2w at some points with super fast tommy guns or super fast cars that are bought with a ton of real cash.  73/100
1594	1	a	Despite the numerous negative reviews. On this game, I killed a lot of time, and to me it is still like that. Most of the reviews I've read, are associated with a large number of cheaters, bugs and occasional updates. (But if you think it is easy to keep the game of this magnitude on the old engine, which also want to update, and it's not a secret). At the expense of cheaters - they are almost there, there are players who play better, and the rest just do not have the nerves. (There were many occasions when they wrote me that I am a cheater, even a couple of videos available) Bugs - well, it's mostly because of the engine. Some events simply can not be processed on slower machines.  Actually, how can you not love a game where you can almost do anything. Huge customization and hours spent in drawing characters.  They Donate, as without him in the MMO game? I played for a long time without premium or other stuff. I did not stop to play. And recently the developers gave the keys 1-3 days premium tied to holiday dates.  The game may seem difficult in the early stages, as not an ordinary mechanics and physics of fire, the ability to look through the corners of the walls, and not just knowledge map.  I still remember one summer evening when I and my friend had nothing to play, we decided to download APB. When we did not even know what to do, but we have developed, made a Role-play (one gunner, sniper and machine gunner), buy cars and created a gang that fought with everyone.  Since then the game has changed a lot, removed some of the roof, which is constantly hiding all (where it was impossible to kill VIP) was added to the aero cars (some believe that it is simply an opportunity to knock out users more money, but enough to buy once, and you can making machines to order, if you know a little draw in the editor), and of course clothes for a unique character.  The game is demanding on resources and often freezes, but this is the reason the old engine with a huge structure that simply can not be maintained well. It's just a matter of time. (I played on secure servers, where the server and test new stuff, there were all just fine.)  In general, this game I really like and I do not regret the time spent in it.
1596	1	a	Best free game on steam love this game its awsome
1598	1	a	Ignoring the fact the game is Pay 2 Win, there are you occasional hackers, gold in silver servers, and all that jazz, this is prehaps one of the best games I have ever played. I remember staying up till 5 in the morning playing, either pwning with the starter which is secretly op, or getting rekted by bought guns which should really be nerfed. You should try it out and see if you can put up with the unfair disadvantages I once had to put up with.
1600	1	a	The experience that GTA just can't nail down...  APB is great, you can customize your character, cars and duke it out in an original cops vs. robbers setting! There are TONS of customization options and even custom logos can be created to truely put your own personal style into it.  The downside of this game since launch has always been that cops will ALWAYS beat the criminals. Cops have access to tasers and no matter how hard a team of criminals may try, tasers will always win against the most heaviest of weapons.  If you want a fun and easy game play experience choose to be a cop.  If you want a challenging but not so rewarding game play experience choose to be a criminal.
1602	1	a	Great game if you're willing to spend at least $20 on it.
1604	1	a	This is one of the best f2p games out there, you should give this a try
1606	1	a	best played with friends :D
1608	1	a	I really, really want to love APB (All Points Bulletin): Reloaded more than I do. Yes, the original APB was riddled with enough cracks and flaws to take it from diamond-in-the-rough to half-eaten-Ring-Pop-that's-shaped-like-a-diamond, but some of its more ambitious ideas were very nearly brilliant. And hey, Reloaded – for the most part – smartly tweaks APB's little problems while leaving its cops-and-robbers core undisturbed. On paper, it sounds like every wannabe grand automobile thief's dream come true. So then, what exactly went wrong?   Above: If only he'd just worn his safety belt  The short answer: A lot of things. First, though, it's essential to point out what went right, because – without a doubt – APB: Reloaded is a more enjoyable experience than its short-lived predecessor. APB's DNA – once a criss-crossing-crashing amalgam of MMO persistence and barely functional riffs on GTA's best ideas – has been straightened into a much finer point. Weapons now do more damage, resulting in faster, more satisfying firefights. Cars, meanwhile, actually possess unique driving models. In other words, no more sports cars that drive like minivans. There's also a teensy bit of weapon-usage-based stat progression to give you something to do beyond amassing a gun collection that'd make even John Woo's bullet-loving doves flee in terror. And then there's a real-money-based in-game store that... well, more on that in a bit.  In a lot of ways, APB fights desperately to be the antidote to modern MMO drudgery – sometimes to a fault. Beyond rudimentary side objectives (things like raiding stores if you're a criminal or returning stolen cars for enforcers), the game is essentially PVE-free. Missions auto-plop you into a group of fellow ne'er-do-wells (or loose cannon cops who don't play by the rules) and assign you objectives – for instance, investigate a vehicle or commit some nice, wholesome arson. The twist, however, is that your enemies aren't trash mob NPCs - they're flesh-and-blood members of the opposing faction. So missions unfold more like objective-based shooter matches, but in a completely open, vehicle-packed urban playground. When APBR works, it really, really works. There's nothing quite like racing neck-and-neck against a sports car full of gangbangers – guns-a-blazing the whole time – toward an objective, crashing and twisting through the air like you've been punted by Godzilla, and then emerging from the wreckage into a hail of gunfire and, er, regular fire. Other MMOs, meanwhile, ask you to collect 20 boar gizzards because, f*** you, don't question it, chore peasant. Better still, similar chaos unfolds all around you, thanks to other groups on similar – though separate – missions. Bullets fly. Cars careen through the streets. Magic happens.   Before long, though, you can't help but see behind the curtain of explosions and car shrapnel, because that's pretty much all there is to it. Mission types are incredibly limited, generally breaking down into “find and deliver a thing, “stop the other team from finding and delivering a thing, and “hold a point for a really long time. New self-contained “Fight Club districts attempt to spice up the rather vanilla proceedings with large-scale team deathmatch and king of the hill battles, but the two currently available maps lend themselves more to haphazard lone wolfery and camping than interesting team tactics.   APBR's city, meanwhile, is utterly lacking in the loving attention to detail of, say, a GTA or the zany outlandishness of a Saints Row. It's just a sprawling sea of gray spotted with shamefully tiny islands of intrigue. So, by and large, APBR devolves into a very simple shooter with very simple modes in a very simple environment. On top of that, the story's basically non-existent. Occasionally, your contracted mission-givers will send you emails, but there's no sense of escalation or progression. It's just an unending tug-of-war between cops and robbers that never actually goes anywhere – a dynamic justifiable only if APBR is secretly set in Purgatory. That general lack of personality becomes all the more disappointing when you start really digging into APBR's absurdly robust character customization suite. Once you've filled out your wardrobe and unlocked a few decal templates, anything's possible. So, of course, we created something that could best be described as the unholy offspring of Batman Beyond and the mopiest, most blue-haired JRPG character you can imagine. At one point, we actually encountered an incredibly authentic Harley Quinn – jester cap and all – and it was love at first sight. Then she shot us in the face. Long story short, APBR's players supply nearly all of its personality. And while that's an interesting idea on paper, it fails to thaw a frozen, unchanging world whose bag of tricks is about as deep as a drought-devoured puddle.   But what about all that free-to-play razzle-dazzle that APB savior GamersFirst can't stop clamoring about? Business models, after all, can make or break MMOs. And while APBR's “Armas Marketplace certainly isn't broken, there are some very worrisome cracks in its armor. For one, the game constantly pestered us about biting a $10 bullet and signing up for a month of Premium access, and it's not hard to see why. Among other things, our piggy bank's valiant sacrifice more than doubled our end-of-mission cash rewards, hugely boosted our faction gains with mission givers, reduced cooldowns, and gave us a 20% discount on all marketplace items. Basically, Premium's the way APBR was meant to be played. Free, by comparison, feels downright sluggish. Then there's the extremely sticky issue of buyable weaponry. Armaments that cost you an arm and a leg aren't necessarily better or worse than those earned by the sweat of your tattooed brow; they're merely different variations on similar ideas. So, ultimately, a kitted out character and someone who upped their arsenal the old fashioned way will be on a roughly even playing field after many hours of play. However, we were able to roll a completely fresh character and immediately buy a fully modded gun that many experienced players swore by. Suddenly, getting matched against fellow low rank players didn't seem so fair. APBR's early goings, then, can be a figurative trial by fire and bees. Because the fire wasn't bad enough.   APBR is a game that suffers from a serious identity crisis. It tries to be both an emergent, skill-based shooter and a full-blown free-to-play MMO, but only succeeds at falling into the abyssal middle ground between the two. Thanks to a number of tiny tweaks and larger additions, Reloaded is definitely a step up from the practically DOA APB that crashed and burned a couple years ago, but the two are still incredibly similar. Fundamental mission structure and variety flaws, unfortunately, stuck around for the ride, and its (improved) simplistic shooting and driving aren't enough to right those wrongs.   It's honestly heartbreaking, because many of the game's ideas teeter on the cusp of being revolutionary. As is, however, All Points Bulletin: Reloaded fires far too many blanks. Free is a tough price to turn down, but the city of San Paro is – at best – a vacation spot. We simply can't recommend an extended stay.
1610	1	a	Really Fun game especialy when playing with friends  
1612	1	a	♥♥♥♥♥est game EU but i play it almost every day because its addicting! JK this game is fun as fun is in it self
1614	1	a	Great game with a friendly community, good servers, and no cheaters.
1616	1	a	I love how you get all this FREE! Its like GTA, but you get to choose your side and stuff!
1618	1	a	its looks like GTA online free to play style
1620	1	a	+Good for killing time :D +free xD +some events  = hard for newbie  -imba legendary gun -theres some cheater around :'(  overall : 7.5 out of 10
1622	1	a	i can not start the game
1624	1	a	im bored.
1626	1	a	When Criminal Players hear sirens nearby they are thinking   'Woop Woop sound of da police'          YouTube™ Video:  KRS One 'Sound of Da Police' ‌‌ - Bohemia After Dark&nbsp;
1628	1	a	Fantastic Game. If you like the Saint's Row Serioes, you will absolutely FALL IN LOVE with this game.
1630	1	a	This game is pretty good, considering it's F2P, although the graphics look like the game took a 32 bit ****. This game looks absolutely horendous, even on max graphics! They thought turning up the brightness settings enhances anything, and in this case it sort of does, but the textures themself are bad almost like N64. This game is only fun with friends (If you can get any). Play with friends who already play this game because there will be tryhards who have about 1000 accounts and play 6000 hours, cherry picking noobs on servers. This game is a P2W sort of. It's mostly pay to look good, but to be honest, why spend money to make your virtual character look good, when you can make yourself look good IN REAL LIFE??? This game gets a capture the objective mission/10. Realistically, this game gets a 7.7/10. This game may be the best F2P game ever! Nah I'm joking TF2 is.
1632	1	a	this is awesome
1634	1	a	I took out 3 snipers using bricks 11/10   (Also IF you see a reveiw saying this game is P2W its really not if u have the skill u can deystroy ANY weapon u find in the Armas Market i would say this game is more like P2C=Pay to Convience which bascially means ur able to get bttr modded weapons quicker BUT i will say there WAS one p2w gun that they NERFED which was the Vas r2 Troublemaker which so OP that it could out gun a sniper at long ranges Sometimes)
1636	1	a	THE BEST AROUUUNNNDDD (:
1638	1	a	im JOHN CENA THE biggest boy and this isnt a game
1640	1	a	APB = Fun and Frustration
1642	1	a	FIrst thing i realy like this games graphics and its gameplay is very great i highly recommend this if you want a f2p game thats open world its so much fun (but you gotta get good at the game for it to be better) :D
1644	1	a	Some guy called me a fagot.  But I ran him over with a garbage truck.  10/10 would run over again.
1646	1	a	I love how you get all this FREE! Its like GTA, but you get to choose your side and stuff!
1648	1	a	It's a okay game but Grand Theft Auto 5 is better
1650	1	a	APB US Districts Simplified - Base your choice off this.   East: Elitist wannabe CS Pros that make excuses for every loss and don't realise they're playing ♥♥♥♥in APB and not CS.  West: Semi austistic emo ♥♥♥♥♥♥s that wear Gunner glasses they got from their mums. Again, they don't realise they're playing APB.
1652	1	a	i like the game its awesome
1654	1	a	good game not the best but one u can ♥♥♥♥ around on
1656	1	a	im JOHN CENA THE biggest boy and this isnt a game
1658	1	a	good game, full of madness and mayhem
1660	1	a	its okay just loads of hackers and cheaters
1662	1	a	Scrolls said its ♥♥♥♥.
1664	1	a	great game they just need to fix the servers and the overall gameplay otherwise it is a blast 
1666	1	a	For a free game its pretty good, but of course it always will have its pros and cons. If you guys just want a simple fast review thats not long, I'm just going to say that overall you should get the game. Don't try to read those reviews thats 134213 pages long. The end result in general would be a good game. Get it.
1668	1	a	Has its querks, but worth playing, even just on and off.
1670	1	a	.
1672	1	a	It's a okay game but Grand Theft Auto 5 is better
1674	1	a	  A really good f2p cops and robber game
1676	1	a	♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ed 
1678	1	a	I've spent more than +100H on this game (despite what Steam says).  You just want to like this game, but the devs are doing quite a poor job at helping you doing so. The game itself is rather nice! The driving is nice, even though you feel this terrible lag caused by the fact that your input are not client-based but server-based. There's some general lag in and there, but still playable. No the real problem with it is the business model. The game, the original APB, was not free but sub-based. The original company simply went out of business. Now the game is free, and offers you quite a large choice is customization and stuff, but locks a lot of content, most of it giving an fairly huge advantage to those who pay. I'm talking about the weapons. I don't mind the XP boost, I like playing the game, but premium weapons often have way better stats. You can buy 10-days weapons... that's kinda sucks, you can't modify them with upgrades. You can buy good cars (forever), and modify them, even though you're quite limited in the decals. The game has more flaws I could talk about, but still, it's rather nice if you can try to look past them. I'll still recommend the game, it's free after all, you're not risking anything. Oh and, play with your friends, makes missions easier.
1680	1	a	Pros: + Free to play + Kinda like GTA Online + Fun to run over pedestrians + I can play Pokemon GO song and ram stuff + Can meet some cool people + Can rob random people on the street + Usable UI when not using a controller  Cons: - Developers (Reloaded Productions) slightly worse than EA - UI is almost usable when playing with a controller - Lots of lag when loading areas - You need to pay to get good stuff - Microtransactions - Got banned for using the stuff I purchased legitimately - Hackers everywhere I turn - Microtransactions - Did I mention microtransactions?  Still a fun game tho, it's better on Xbox despite the fact the UI was designed for a mouse and keyboard... Edit: forgot microtransactions
1682	1	a	Best Game Ever ! U need to try it &lt;3 
1684	1	a	I only play this when I'm feeling like a self-loathing masochistic maniac that drives over civilians and only civilians. Then I uninstall.
1686	1	a	APB = Fun and Frustration
1688	1	a	Best game ever, most fun and addicted game i have ever played, it would be much better if there werent so many bugs, but defiantly worth playing.
1690	1	a	No matter how '♥♥♥♥♥♥' this game may seem to many, I've been with it since beta &amp; this will always be my favorite MMO. I've met some great people (despite some of the cancer community) and it is honestly a unique piece of ♥♥♥♥. It's lost a lot of it's potential, I'll admit, but staying up for days playing nothing but this game back in the day was a ton of fun, and nevertheless, I still enjoy it.
1692	1	a	one problem U CANT GET A GOOD TEAM
1694	1	a	played a little could be butter 
1696	1	a	It's a interesting game with a decent graffics
1698	1	a	Great game, Fun to play with friends and connect with others, Highly addicting :P
1700	1	a	Lol I never actually played this
1702	1	a	Right now, I'm in a love-hate relationship with APB: Reloaded.  On one hand, it's a fun game to waste time in. Fun shooting, a lot of customization options, music making, socializing, battles.  The battles are fantastic, they're very intense sometimes, and if you have a team full of people communicating, they can be blast to fight.  With the customization, you're allowed to do so much. For example, I recreated Niko Bellic in the game, with the Donkey Kong theme playing everytime I kill a player.  On the other hand, the driving is terrible, it's like your wheels have been slathered in ♥♥♥ lube. Your car will do a lot of flips from the smallest collision like you're playing with Hot Wheels again. At the beginning of the game, it's very Pay to Win. You start with a medium-to-short range assault rifle that can be amazing in CQC, but sucks anywhere else. And since this is an open-world city game, CQC is rare. P2W will allow other players to buy long-range weaponry, such as sniper rifles, and they will absolutely dominate your ♥♥♥♥.  All in all, it's an alright game with some features that could be fixed.  6/10
1704	1	a	Nominated: Best Waste of Time BWT!
1706	1	a	
1708	1	a	been called a hacker so man times i feel like the fbi is watching me now. oh and fried chicken is very good if you use butter milk with the breading.
1710	1	a	now let me say, this game is by no rights a great game, hell, even a good game, but its one of my favourites. sure GamersFirst have ruined the game, yes, but i still think it is pretty fun, this is essentially the poor persons saints row or gta, also, the community, from what i have seen, alot are ♥♥♥♥♥, a few arnt,
1712	1	a	This game is good except for the fact that if you are a criminal you can spend 30-40 minutes getting $2.5k in your stash only to have enforcers hunt you down and take your money like that. Who thought that was a good idea??? I had to 1v2 and while i was trying to deposit my cash he just threw nades at me. I spawned back in only to see him speeding off with a supercar he probably spent hours getting or hours convincing his mom to buy that trash. Then his mate comes and distracts me by gunning me down, luckily i killed him, but i just lost 30 minutes of my time like what. Everything else is fun about this game, just dont get over $2000 in your pocket or ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s will hunt you down and take all your cash unless you got a crew of people.
1714	1	a	only fun if you play this game with friend   11/10 time killing   500hours+ outside steam
1716	1	a	It's pretty good as long as you don't play it ;)
1718	1	a	I recommend this game, but I want the game to be more stable for ex: not really laggy. So if the owner wants to make the game size bigger, I won't mind. But this is only depending on my opinion.
1720	1	a	all kinds of people to meet  waste your time in social  8.5/10
1722	1	a	The feelings I have for APB Reloaded are confusing and mixed. Some points it's a very good game, and sometimes it's just annoying and horrible. Overall it's pretty decent, 10/10 bang my mom again
1724	1	a	very much enjoyable.  but bring money if you plan on getting the full experience (FULL character customization, certain guns &amp; cars, etc)  would recommend
1726	1	a	Great game, although i suspect hacking amongst fellow players, so it may be hard to face off against other players at times. Although its a very well rounded game, you can make money by doing missions, or as simple as crashing ur vehicle into a storefront and load up ur vehicle with the goods and sell it later as a criminal, or you can be a cop and stop the criminals from robbing places or do missions against criminals also.
1728	1	a	I d'like to see more games like this   because the game by itself AWESOME!!!  and u can play with ur frineds and meet other players   and the open world in it .   its AWESOME!!!
1730	1	a	pretty fun overall, and a one of a kind game for sure. littel rough around the edges, and needs some fixing but its a great game especially with friends.
1732	1	a	Yes very good  I can never get a kill but... the other minigames are fun.
1734	1	a	APB Reloaded (All Points Bulletin)  - Pros  - Good preformence on most systems  - Good gameplay  - Decent graphics  - Character &amp; Vehicle Customization   - Cons  - Lots of P2W (Pay to Win) Aspects   - P2W Ex; Armas Market, Best Guns are only bought with real life currency  - Not the best driving mechanics  - Gunplay is still a bit buggy  - Movement in general needs improvement  - Overall Score  - 7.5/10
1736	1	a	Very good game, best staff ever 'totally' listen to the community and make things actually happen + they release a lot of totally not p2w weapons, such as the Raptor 45 'Condor' the balance of that monster is just wonderful! What more could you ask ? It's obviously better than GTA V because APB:R is very optimized too, so almost any family computer could run it at a astonishing 10 fps, heck you can probably even use a laptop that you just bought off craigslist and get a sweet 5 fps. In conclusion this game is magnificent and I recommend you get it right now!   P.S  totally a legit review.
1738	1	a	hay it wont let me play:( only if had good laptop 
1740	1	a	Play it and stop looking for bad reviews
1742	1	a	i LOVE THIS GAME! Its pretty much a free GTA 5
1744	1	a	This game was fun until I got bullied by Tanyaslayer. Then I quit. Tanyaslayer is really mean.
1746	1	a	Great game, Fun to play with friends and connect with others, Highly addicting :P
1748	1	a	good game but i suggest you get a group of friends before you play since you get trolls alot that will kill you for no reason but other than that it is a good game has good gameplay
1750	1	a	It's a interesting game with a decent graffics
1752	1	a	Great game, so much fun fighting it out against the enforcers as a criminal. The customization in this game is amazing!
1754	1	a	No matter how '♥♥♥♥♥♥' this game may seem to many, I've been with it since beta &amp; this will always be my favorite MMO. I've met some great people (despite some of the cancer community) and it is honestly a unique piece of ♥♥♥♥. It's lost a lot of it's potential, I'll admit, but staying up for days playing nothing but this game back in the day was a ton of fun, and nevertheless, I still enjoy it.
1756	1	a	I hate this game because it is such a b*tch!
1758	1	a	this game is ok i quess i got to say tho making a beat that your enemy hears every time they die is a great feature
1760	1	a	I love Apb all the degenerates who hate on the game for the sole reason that they're bad can go die.  It isn't pay to win, succ me, the ntec is broken.
1762	1	a	I wouldn't say I dislike this game but it relates way too much to Saints Row and Grand Theft Auto I enjoyed playing it but just didn't have fun and un-installed it. But I do reccomend it to people that like games that resemble other games
1764	1	a	I hate this game because it is such a b*tch!
1766	1	a	i died from a flailing leg. 10/10
1768	1	a	I was one of the best when it came to taking out the garbage. Rikkaybobbay and MeatballTony approved.
1770	1	a	The game itself has a huge potential to become successfull, but two things keep it from becoming one, its frustrating for new players, its unoptimazation. But im still gonna recommend it because its after all a cool game. You can get the premium weps from goals that you get everyday if I remember. They are not pernament, you can buy pernament legendaries from the market, oca-nano wep was like 4mill. And by the way, people complain about hackers, havent seen a one single hacker in my game time, I have like 100 more hours outside steam...
1772	1	a	Great game to play with friends, you can troll with blowtorch lol Ghost ride and destroy other cars without damaging your own :P   Downvote for the hackers or just really suspicious people on here :3   Good game, worth giving a try :P
1774	1	a	From playing this since 2010, it has defenatly changed a lot. There was no where near as much content as there was when i first started out, with New Guns coming out frequently and plans for new cars, new engine, a lot more objectives and things to do. Fairfight banning hackers and GM's starting to atleast be in the game, APB has potential to be great. The Custimation is killer but could have a lot more conent. Holiday and Random events are fun. People are always gonna find SOMETHING to complain about. The Game was really bad a few years ago. Right now i would say it's growing better in hopes for a really great future. Give it a try and be patient and have fun.
1776	1	a	Okay so I've had this game since it's original release with RealTime Worlds and I was here when it was  re-released  and then I quit, for a long time. Partly because friends stopped playing, or because of other things I was interested in. The hours I have logged on Steam are by no means representative of the total amount of time I've spent in this game, since there were multiple clients before APB was ever tied to Steam.  With that out of the way...   Pros
1778	1	a	Did i ever tell you guys the classical music on the radio in this game is majestic af?
1780	1	a	To all of you ♥♥♥♥♥ing about Pay to Win and Hackers. They really are not a problem. This game offers tons of customization, pay to win is not a thing because you can manage it with your own weapon and modifications. I have literally only run into 1 hacker my whole time and he got instantly banned by the anti-cheat 3 minutes into the mission. I have not spent a dime on this game and it is extremely fun. Just don't expect to be any good at it if you suck ♥♥♥ at video games. Have fun :)
1782	1	a	I love this game! ^^  + F2P! + huge range of opportunities for play! + the city is very well built! + appearance of the cars, characters, weapons is very good, i like it! + female characters are very beautiful! + there are a lot of interesting missions! - small fps gives! - not so detailed video settings to be accessible to all! - there is little packages to purchase in Steam!    I recommend this game! 8/10
1784	1	a	No hackers here. 10/10, would pay $300+ to get owned every game again.
1786	1	a	Probs my most favourite game but the lag and ddos attacks make me want to turn away 7/10 NEEDS IMPROVING ALOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1788	1	a	weed/420 would blaez again
1790	1	a	Game is great, Gamersfirst is ♥♥♥♥ l0l stop being selloutz and fix gaem plz  game haz potenshul, g1 iz just drag1ing d0wn th3 g43m    fix pl0x st0p b31ng s3ll0ut5 pl0x   Gamersfirst? MORE LIEK GIVEUSYOURMONEHZfirst shitheds     
1792	1	a	This game is really the worse game to ever ♥♥♥♥ing come out hacker then another to the next. This game needs to be shut the [♥♥♥♥] down. Really the game is like pay to win. If i was a top company that rated games id give this ♥♥♥♥ a -10/10
1794	1	a	YES, BEST GAME RANK 235 BEST PLAYER INTERNATIONALLY KNOWN IN THE GAME ROLE MODEL FOR OTHERS ENJOY TEACHING NEW PEOPLE
1796	1	a	APB: Reloaded has one glaring flaw that seems to be recognized universally, the matchmaking. If you are a new recruit suiting up in the world you are going to face some adverse challenges with the competition levels. There isn't any barrier between people with rank 195 perks, facing off against others who haven't unlocked any at all. I honestly think this game has a lot of potential, however it's hard to swallow the vast modification and weapon advantages my opponents have on me. It is a useless and disappointing matchmaking system. They need to create a better way of seperating players based on criteria.
1798	1	a	awesome game i came back to it after i started to hate it for community 2 years ago. its good to be back on the streets of san paro wastin everybody :D i recommend this game for everyone who is looking for an amazing free multiplayer experience! on a note for all gpu maxers do not use vsync and framerate smoothing together or you will have heavy mouse and keyboard input lag!
1800	1	a	Easily one of the best games I have ever played. I've been playing APB since 2010, and don't intend to stop any time soon. The game is being upgraded to a brand-new Engine very soon, that offers better graphics and performance, as well as all-new content. The game is also being released on PS4 and Xbox One in the coming months. Some people don't like this game, and some people love it. The learning curve is diffficult to master, but very rewarding once you get your feet on the ground. Another complaint is that this game is Pay 2 Win. While there are items you can buy with real money, these guns are NOT necessarily better than in-game weaponry by any means. No single weapon will guarantee you a win, whatsoever. There are skilled players that could beat you with a starter weapon, and unskilled players that may lose regardless of weapon choice. Feel free to add me as a friend if you need any pointers, or someone to play with. If you give the game a chance, I am sure you will love it.
1802	1	a	YES, BEST GAME RANK 235 BEST PLAYER INTERNATIONALLY KNOWN IN THE GAME ROLE MODEL FOR OTHERS ENJOY TEACHING NEW PEOPLE
1804	1	a	Pay to win
1806	1	a	Gets 50 fps on GTAV Gets 25 fps on Apb Reloaded gg good game 11/10 ign will buy again                                                                                         ʳᵉᶫᵉᵃˢᵉ ᵗʰᵉ ᶰᵉʷ ᵉᶰᶦᶰᵉ ᵃᶫʳᵉᵃᵈʸ, ᵖᶫᶻ
1808	1	a	APB: Reloaded has one glaring flaw that seems to be recognized universally, the matchmaking. If you are a new recruit suiting up in the world you are going to face some adverse challenges with the competition levels. There isn't any barrier between people with rank 195 perks, facing off against others who haven't unlocked any at all. I honestly think this game has a lot of potential, however it's hard to swallow the vast modification and weapon advantages my opponents have on me. It is a useless and disappointing matchmaking system. They need to create a better way of seperating players based on criteria.
1810	1	a	Pros:  Terrible Community Hackers Hack accusators (Hackusators) Incompetent anti-cheat program Broken threat/matchmaking system Broken spawning system Lack of players Absent DDOS protection Servers are powered by hamsters Poor optimization Turtle paced updates (that only bring new cash shop guns or trivial event) Money First (M1)  Cons:  N/A
1812	1	a	I recomend this game just for the reviews. i think im in love with this game, i think i love it. the other day i asked it to go to prom with me but i accidentaly leant on its uninstall butten and i got arrested for man slaughter.
1814	1	a	Amazing game 'till i got banned and when i tried to appeal it got the same old message   11/10 would go back if i got unbanned
1816	1	a	Pros:  Terrible Community Hackers Hack accusators (Hackusators) Incompetent anti-cheat program Broken threat/matchmaking system Broken spawning system Lack of players Absent DDOS protection Servers are powered by hamsters Poor optimization Turtle paced updates (that only bring new cash shop guns or trivial event) Money First (M1)  Cons:  N/A
1818	1	a	Works even with a potato for a computer.
1820	1	a	Dressed up as superheroes and ran around handcuffing then shooting criminals with friends. Would reccomend as a great game to play with family aged 6-60!
1822	1	a	Free 2 Plays are the great.
1824	1	a	The highs are really high, the lows are really frequent.  Though not as much lately!  I've been playing APB on and off since RTW beta and it honestly does just keep getting tighter and better all the time. I can't for the life of me persuade anyone to return to give it another chance, though.  The customisation options alone mark this out as something special, but managing to have a roughly working game where 100 players can drive around in their custom vehicles in their custom outfits playing their customised theme tunes having non-instanced PvP missions against each other on a huge map is even more of an achievement.  It's not GTA and it doesn't have fancy euphoria physics or anything, but when it's good none of that matters.
1826	1	a	This is the WORST game I have ever played. Every single problem you could have with a game, this right here caters to it. It has 20 minuite loading screens, more micro transactions than any game I have EVER seen, and lags to all hell. But it is some of the most amusing 15 minuites you will ever have with friends.
1828	1	a	Its like Saints row, but free
1830	1	a	best shooter game ever good quality and great graphics i really recommend getting this game
1832	1	a	I love this game but it's pay to win. I understand that the creators have to get an income sometime, but they could atleast in the future make it pay to play instead of pay to win or do a give away for the holaday's and give everyone who does some challanges a gun or a car kit or something like that.
1834	1	a	Fundamentally, APB is a very fun game: easy to get into, hard to put down. Just don't put it down for TOO long or you may end up getting locked out by the infuriatingly obstructive PunkBuster.
1836	1	a	A really good game.I am happy that the gaming evolves every day.
1838	1	a	after 28h of playing i can recomend the game to everyone.It may not have the best physics o graphics but i dont know bout the others buti found the community very good.You can pretty much ask anywhere for help and when you first log into the game you'll be welcome from everyone and the tutorial is very effective too.The game concept is good the side missions are fun the optimization might not be perfect but it is good enough for low-end machines.Customization is amazingly awesome.To sum up this game is a gta v but free and with worse graphics and physics
1840	1	a	Verygood but it lags for me

1844	1	a	it's not give me to logg in. wierd
1846	1	a	i played this on and off till 2010. many ppl are getting frustrated so i try to make this quick for completly new players.   is it p2w?  only if you compare 1on1 situations. but it is NOT in a mixed team. that said, the game is frustrating at first and has a steep learing curve, you will start enjoying it after 150h or so. befor that, its a pain. i still play this with the starter weapon, because its the most versatile gun with a random team of people.  the game is heavily build around range, so your gun is only effective in certain scenarios. sub-machine guns/shotguns for close encounters, assault rifles for mid-range, snipers for longrange and machine guns against hard targets (cars). there are alot of niche roles but don't bother with them at first.  your starting weapon is a  mid-range  assault rifle (STAR 556). the gun is basically good in most situations but won't exceed in any. if you keep that in mind and don't let the enemy lure you into situations where your weapon is inferior (basically situations where you try to kill a sniper at high range or outperform a shotgun in close quarter), the odds are mostly even and only movement and skill will decide the outcome.  thats about it. 2 veteran players can easly outmaneuver and destroy a whole group of players with payed weapons with just positioning and granate throwing skills... sure there are alot of veteran players out there with payed guns and a ton of hours gameplay which are deadly in most encounters but it's not the payed guns, its mainly good gameplay.  the game is also very 'ragey' and full of trolls. don't know about the hackers too... also since g1 took this game over i think the server-performance is pretty ♥♥♥♥, type '/fps' ingame to see your performance, if your fps spike to often in battle, just don't play it. you will lose because of bad latency and its frustrating.  overall i can recommend it, its free, great tactical gameplay. its mostly skill based with a very harsh learning curve.
1848	1	a	It`s an awsum game to play, very easy to get addicted to it. Play hard and kill LOTS ! (have fun)
1850	1	a	Well seeing as how this game's complicated to a fault, ONLY has an awkward 'over the shoulder' camera view that I can't stand, the freeroam is day or night always full of spawn campers &amp; high level cops who either kill you or bust you every 5 secs... (WHY? because the X-box 360 won't map to the stick for stuff like turn left or right in driving mode in your car, amoung other control mapping issues on foot ect. it's not even entirely clear about if the zones [beside the social 1 where nobody shoots you &amp; you can edit your char ect.] are or are not PVP on all the time, who wants to die 10,000 times while struggling to grind a brand new char in areasd full of level capped toons with an inferiority complex... crimecraft was more fun then this @ lower levels. do_Ob
1852	1	a	Fun game. Free to play but Buy to win.
1854	1	a	I like it alot. That is all I have to say.
1856	1	a	i really like this game but the controles are wierd and the the graphics has false advertise
1858	1	a	Even if it's not the action that keeps you playing, just messing around in the social district and designing logos, tattoos and whatnot can be reason enough to dl this title. LOVE IT
1860	1	a	Great game and its a little pay to win but once you level up a bit and understand the gunplay the pay to win aspect of the game is gone and the amount of custimization is out of this world insane. I love the game and could not recomend it more.
1862	1	a	Its Apb.
1864	1	a	i love this game too bad my laptop is too ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and cant play it smoothly 7/10
1866	1	a	The game is quite good if you have someone to play it with the vehicles are fun to drive gameplay is alright and the customization is awesome
1868	1	a	A Fun remake of GTA For the PC For Free ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥IT!!
1870	1	a	this is amazing game any one need to play
1872	1	a	nice, and cool game! 
1874	1	a	While APB is not without its own set of issues, GamersFirst's dedication and continual, weekly patching makes APB an enjoyable PvP based open world GTA clone that is always fresh and vibrant. The vibrance of this game also stems from the community, as ever complex and new artistic designs of clothes, cars and symbols are being made with the in-game photoshop client. If you can dream it, you can have it in game (and if you cant make it yourself, many individuals would be more than happy to be contracted out to do so).  GamersFirst strives for a truly free-to play experience where nothing is pay-to-win or pay-to-play. All real world cash bought weapons can be bought from within the game, and the starting weapons given are considered to be above aveage in terms of usability and reliability. The only real money exclusives are cosmetic items for clothing, weapon skins or car kits, give nothing in terms of game advantage. When Realtime Worlds went bankrupt in 2010, APB reopened up under GamersFirst with a premise of creating a better user experience. And within the last year alone, patches for elective spawning, multiple new weapons, level-cap increases/contacts, UI optimization, Server and Client side optimization, new open world maps, new character/weapon/car modifications have all greatly improved the content and expereince within APB. And in Q1 of 2014, the complete overhaul of game engine from Unreal 2008 to Unreal 2013 will breathe new life into this game, allowing it to compete against games such as GTA V Online in terms of massive content, graphics and playerbase options.  The gameplay itself tends to present itself as a steep learning curve for most new players, but new tutorials and an active community allow for even the most inexpereinced players to enjoy the game. There is no wrong way to play APB. Many individuals play the game to dress up and design outfits, others just drive around racing in their cars, while others enjoy blowing everything up. For most players, APB presents itself as a solid, well-rounded game where no matter what you are looking for, you'll find it within. And the best part...you dont pay a cent.
1876	1	a	Free 2 Plays are the great.
1878	1	a	Pretty good game, shoot people and steal stuff :D so fun 8/10
1880	1	a	A very pay2win, unbalanced, glitchy, laggy game that is fun only 15% of the time. It's full of hackers and constant lag spikes due to the horrid servers that the devs won't upgrade.
1882	1	a	violence killing robbing those all equal to a bad ♥♥♥ game
1884	1	a	awesome, you can customize everything. but to many OP or Hacking people
1886	1	a	This game is GTA online,but just a little bit different :). Play if you love GTA :D
1888	1	a	The only reason I left this game, was because of the cheaters and now apparently they cleaned it up, I'm looking forward to playing again.
1890	1	a	The game is good.
1892	1	a	i love this game too bad my laptop is too ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and cant play it smoothly 7/10
1894	1	a	Good game but you have to be a real MLG because there are some people that are just way to pro.
1896	1	a	alwesome game.because i have code premium
1898	1	a	A really good game.I am happy that the gaming evolves every day.
1900	1	a	Action packed and thrilling! This game will keep you on your toes.
1902	1	a	A very pay2win, unbalanced, glitchy, laggy game that is fun only 15% of the time. It's full of hackers and constant lag spikes due to the horrid servers that the devs won't upgrade.
1904	1	a	I spent hours working on my car and called it the bumblebee. Noxxy said it was ♥♥♥♥ and laughed at it. so i ran him over and laughed at his body.
1906	1	a	Pretty good game, shoot people and steal stuff :D so fun 8/10
1908	1	a	A 'Pay-To-Win' free-to-play MMO, that doesn't take itself very seriously. And you shouldn't either. Fun game when the sole purpose is to have the most fun as possible. Once you start taking it seriously, then you're pouring money into it, and it becomes a chore to be #1, as someone is bound to spend more money than you just to be king.  100x better with friends.
1910	1	a	I like the game. It is actually pretty good, but the thing they should add is first person shoolting and looking down sights
1912	1	a	I Love This GAME
1914	1	a	APB: Reloaded is a third person shooter where you can choose your path as an Enforcer or Criminal. This is a very time-consuming game, but in my opinion it is worth the time. When I first started I did not understand anything at all, but when I started to put some time into the game I really started to like it. It is the game I have spent most time in overall. One more thing I have to mention is the customization oppurtunities. You can make your character or car look like anything, as you can create your own tattoos and symbols etc. WARNING: This game is not very welcoming for newcomers; as it has a complicated user interface and a VERY toxic playerbase. Good luck hitting the streets of San Paro!
1916	1	a	You want a game that is worth more for your money than Grand theft auto this is it. You can be a cop you can be a convict join a gang and fight rivals. Cars, Npc's, quests. At the launch of this game it had major issues when it came back reloaded it began to shine as it was meant too. This game in my experience has less hackers than in most games you actually have to pay to get into. Enjoy all and buckle up.  Cheers, Reefler
1918	1	a	APB, Played it for so much that I have have been so attached to it. I recomend it for anyone who likes GTA Type games
1920	1	a	great game to make memes with
1922	1	a	after 28h of playing i can recomend the game to everyone.It may not have the best physics o graphics but i dont know bout the others buti found the community very good.You can pretty much ask anywhere for help and when you first log into the game you'll be welcome from everyone and the tutorial is very effective too.The game concept is good the side missions are fun the optimization might not be perfect but it is good enough for low-end machines.Customization is amazingly awesome.To sum up this game is a gta v but free and with worse graphics and physics
1924	1	a	All Points Bulleting  (MMORPG Third Person Shooter)    The game is based on GTA-style, which is MMO the concept of having cops and criminals. The game is based at 18+ audiences just like any GTA. There are fractions to the game:   Criminals: can ram raid the shopping markets; steal the goods and selling them to contacts their dealers. Stealing goods has a downside as the Enforcers (cops) can witness you doing a crime and steal your money by killing you after you become witnessed, so you have watch out for them. Criminals have fully customisable clothing and cars.    Enforcer: these guys can patrol the streets of San Paro looking for any robbers. From there cops can Witness the criminals that are committing a crime, which allows them to be arrested or taken out. Using less than lethal weapons allows the cops to stun the bad guys, which can then be arrested.
1926	1	a	It's ok I guess.
1928	1	a	my playtime consists entirely of updating
1930	1	a	its so freking cool its better then gta 5
1932	1	a	Nice game very fun with friends hard in beginning but later on you get better 8/10
1934	1	a	Fun game but too much hackers &gt;.&gt;
1936	1	a	I hate this game so much.
1938	1	a	APB reload is a fun open world cop vs robbers game and yeah there is a few bugs here and there but over all a greatgame and yes you need a somwhat good computer to run but its woth it so go have fun
1940	1	a	The game is good.
1942	1	a	One of the best mmo games Ever :)

1946	1	a	Amazing, but you need to pay a little bit of money to get good things in the game.
1948	1	a	Gta is better :P (ofc)
1950	1	a	A Fun remake of GTA For the PC For Free ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥IT!!
1952	1	a	Hugely Underrated Open-World Game!!!
1954	1	a	Its more or less like a cheaper version of GTA 5 but with a little more action. There are many servers and 3 different maps to chose from which is great for when a hacker joins one. Fair fight the anti cheat system gets most of them, just not in time. Still a great game, many challenging players to go against. You can either be an enforcer or a criminal. There is vehicle, character, and weapon customization.
1956	1	a	Great Open World Game...
1958	1	a	This game might not be perfect, and it might be plagued with issues such as optimization, server performance, hack prevention, terrible matchmaking system (one that relies on a faulty threat level system), and more...  But, it's a game that is unlike any other, and one that has a lot of potential. The customization offered in APB: Reloaded is unrivaled: allowing you to customize your clothing, appearence, car, music, and graffiti as much as you want (within defined symbol limits; premium members [A 10$ish fee] get more layers to use).  I've played this since before it was APB:R. It's been about three long years (or, technically, like two years and like three months). It remains to be seen if APB:R will last. Management has not been kind to the game in the last two years, despite their attempts. The newest management claims to be more dedicated to fixing the game... that remains to be seen. There's a lot that needs to be done.  But if this game does get its ♥♥♥♥ together (and I really, really hope it does), it could easily become popular again.   It's just got a long way to go.    Still: Give it a shot. At the very least for the customization. The game will seem bad from the get-go (the learning curve is steep and the community is awful), but try to stick around.
1960	1	a	how to play APB.  1. find hacker 2. realize your made of adaptanium 3. bring friend into game 4. become pay to play 5. realize your living on the street with a bunch of homeless 6. a hobo takes the rest of your money 7. cry 8. waste your last few dollars on a pistol 9. realize theres no internet connection on the streets 10. die of naked homeless that play APB
1962	1	a	It's aight.
1964	1	a	this game sucks more ♥♥♥♥ than a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ muscle  https://youtu.be/N6XKxTUU1O0?t=639 
1966	1	a	  After like 1400 hours of ingame time (I used to play without steam, so it says only like 820 hours +-), I can say, that this game has a lot of potential. It's a good game, but bad game at same time. It's like eating a steak, but made by horrible cook... and the cook is dumb and doesnt want to learn... simply this game needs a better developers. There's a lot of new content for money, but no engine improvements...  + GTA-like idea, free to play. + Your cars, your outfits, clans. + Amount of Weapons (A lot of people say premium weapons broke the game, but actually only few of them are useful, the rest are just reskins of basic weapons you can buy at vendor... even some medium player with some op weapon can be easily defeated, you just have to use your brain and have better aim, that's all. It is a shooting game guys, you win with your aim, not with accessory) + Events for easter, halloween, christmas.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  - toxic community - hackers (but you have them everywhere... better to have one in 10 minutes long mission than 45 minutes spent in CS:GO playing against hacker ;-) ) - A lot of cool stuff, like outfits and cars, but for 'VIP' money. You can make that money, but not enough for cool stuff, only for basic things like kneepads or some basic mask. (For me, it was enough, all I need is just a shirt and some pants to put some colors on... when you receive a free premium, you can create a lot of cool stuff, it just needs a good mind for that :) ) - The poor game performance (engine) - Sometimes some ping issues.  Can't think of anything else, but I think it is enough.  In my opinion, it is a very good game to play, you should definitely try it out, maybe you will like it as I did :) I found the best group of people, and even though the game sucked sometimes, we enjoyed the best time. So I just hope you'll find a good community to play with, it will keep you ingame.  
1968	1	a	I met two guys driving Garbage Trucks, i found another one and we all blocked a road and killed about 10 people from speeding into us.  This game is fun.
1970	1	a	  It's a cool game, I had a lot of fun and crazy experiences over the generations of players. However, with the current generation, people seem less creative and fun, and more set on just winning in the most unusually cruel ways. So mine's a mixed review, but I'll recommend it because it's free and still fun. (YOU CAN BUILD ANYONE YOU WANT!)
1972	1	a	This can repetitive sometimes but decent game.
1974	1	a	Pros -Game is good, fun, and it tries to be balanced -Theres probably a story there, i'm pretty sure? -Driving is hella fun -Missions can be challenging depending on who your with and who your against and the objective -I can be a creepy bunny person and run over pedestrians Cons -The community is pure cancer, awful awful human beings who you'd think they come from ♥♥♥♥♥ with how they act -The 'balance' is not there sometimes so you'll be paired with players far above your skill or rank level leading to players with gernade launchers and rocket launchers killing you instantly -Everyone is salty at some point, or they are hacking, or they are rerolls (Making a new account to get to lower level areas and kick everyones ♥♥♥) or some other excuse for why they couldn't beat you or whatever -Driving can also be a ♥♥♥♥ing nightmare with minges who go around in dump trucks or cement trucks, or and huge ♥♥♥ vehical and start pushing people around to annoy them -Every cop in the ♥♥♥♥ing city has a rocket or gernade launcher, its only luck that will decide if they are a good human being or not -Sometimes the game is infuriating with how bad it can be, i've ragequit a few times from the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ steep learning curve this game has, but it really is worth it when you get a team who knows what they are doing and can kick anyones ♥♥♥
1976	1	a	Pretty good GTA with Teams
1978	1	a	I met two guys driving Garbage Trucks, i found another one and we all blocked a road and killed about 10 people from speeding into us.  This game is fun.
1980	1	a	APB Reloaded? HELL YES !  Cheaters YES !   Lag YES !  Go work for a month so you can stay competitive YES !  Awesome customization YES !  You wanna lose your mind getting raged on and killed by hackers 24/7 YES!  Overall? Enjoyed the game. Rly did, called a few friends in, all gave up after 3-4 days cause the cheating got to a point of stupidity.  Will I play again? Probably yes, Im stupid that way.  Recommendation? Play while you're bronze, when you get to silver, just delete the game ! GL HF!
1982	1	a	I'll start off this review by saying that this game is not P2W in any way, shape or form. Sure, you can pay for weapons and upgrades early, but a full team of expert STAR users can demolish a team of paid gun users pretty easily.  So here are the pros and cons.  Pros + Excellent character customization. + Very fun, especially with friends. + Progression that steadily takes longer as you move up in contracts, meaning you can't just beat the game in a day or two. + Contracts in both Financial and Waterfront, so you don't feel like you need to be confined to one map to get quests done. + Many fun minigames, such as one where a grenade launcher randomly spawns on the map, and several people fight over it. + When you beat a team of people who paid for their upgrades early, you get that satisfaction of skill. + Starting item has the best stock stats out of most of the weapons in the game, and can very easily carry you through missions in the right hands  Cons - Game doesn't often get updated outside of the Armas Marketplace. New engine upgrade been teased at for about 5 years, a rather ridiculous amount of time. - Skill level can be exceptionally high, especially considering you have to level contracts to get new weapons, and in turn, face those who spent money early. Again, not p2w, but p4w (pay 4 weapons.) - Cosmetics tend to look drab or plain dumb up until the later contracts, leaving you with very little option aside from customizing your own gear. - Limits on vehicle paint, graffiti, etc (Why do I only get a certain amount of slots to customize my own icon?) - Later contracts are a harsh grind. I can understand that it functions as levels, and shouldn't be as quick as your first contract, but your only real method of getting to the top are the missions. - The game takes up an abysmally high amount of memory. ( ranged at 2 million kb for me at peak.) - FairFight is obviously flawed. (Showing off by displaying a ban message in the hud each time a 'hacker' is banned, although most of the time they miss the bigger ones, or just completely ban the wrong people.  Overall, the game is about a 6/10, 7/10 with friends. It's worth a try, seeing as it isn't completely bad, but it isn't the best game I've played by far.
1984	1	a	I guess it's an ok game.
1986	1	a	Great game, I just do not get those comments like 'Poor mans GTA'- This is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. I have GTA V and I have played it alot,.. that game has only Online ranks like 1.. 2... 3... etc. This thing has a lots of more, like contacts, fight club.. When GTA V or Online has annoyed you and you want to play Shooting games, then this is the right one.   +1 from me P.S. APB Reloaded's physics aren't the best part of it...
1988	1	a	Awesome free to play game.  Pros: Starter gun is one of the best guns. Most paid guns are just reskins of non-paid in game guns.  Cons: Can get ♥♥♥♥ed by vets. Can also get ♥♥♥♥ed by some p2w weapons.
1990	1	a	Even though this game is Pay-To-Win which i don't normally play, it's the only Pay-To-Win game i enjoy  Pro's  - You can customize pretty much everything - Graphics are nice - Loads of things to do like missions/pvp/social/chill   Con's  - PvP Feels Unbalanced - Pay-To-Win - Toxic Players join your missions.  Overall Rating: 8.5/10
1992	1	a	Game is good. But game is bad.   The game is a fun just mess around type game. If you are someone who takes gaming extremely serious. I would stray away from this game.   Pros: ~Customization is amazing.  ~Classic gameplay style ~Decent car mechanics  ~Tons of fun glitches and bugs  Cons: ~Community ~Developers don't care about it ~Extremely Pay2Win ~And more  Good game if you just want to kill time and have fun.   Bad game if you want to be a serious competitor.. Unless you have a lot of money : )

1996	1	a	Best Garbage truck simulator out there
1998	1	a	I guess it's an ok game.
2000	1	a	Amazing free to play multi player FPS
2002	1	a	I would recommend this game because it is not Pay2Win. This game actually requires very much skills and knowledge ;) When you have played like 40 hours you should know enought to be good at this game. The ingame community is suprisingly funny but sometimes rude. It is my favorite game because I never laughed my ♥♥♥ off that much with my friends ;) 
2004	1	a	copy of gta but its free so lol not p2w. Glitchy, so still needsupdates but might as well play, its free
2006	1	a	Best game in the ♥♥♥♥ing world!
2008	1	a	Good game, but i have a 4GB RAM computer and i lag, even though it started as a Third-Person-Shooter, they need to add a first peoson mode for people who don`t like Third Person Games, i mean, even GTA has it now, so if this game was based off of it, then bring the first person like GTA has now.  8/10
2010	1	a	♥♥♥♥
2012	1	a	Not horrible but... It's host on GamersFirst. Ever play WarRock? If you did you will understand.
2014	1	a	Would be the perfect game if there weren't so many smug ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s...
2016	1	a	+ Fun game. - Idiotic community. - Pay 2 Win. 
2018	1	a	Good If You Can Run It Sad That I cant my CPU is to low thats all it is why i cant run it
2020	1	a	played it on my old pc and i'll play it again!
2022	1	a	pretty good game if you like to play GTA online alot! like me.
2024	1	a	Recommended for Free2Play and casual play.   After pushing myself to try this game out for a couple of hours it just didn't have what it took to pull me in and keep me entertained. This style of MMO can be fun but it is very obvious that APB Reloaded is a 'take and hold' type of game with a p2w factor included.   I do appreciate a game of this quality to be free2play however and the devs did a nice job in the creation of something better than a quest to collect and bring back flowers. The quests are easier to understand after a bit of time invested but very obvious that development could be better in terms of questing.  If you are looking for a way to kill time by the same objective over and over in a GTA-limited style, then this game is for you and there is no problem with that. In my opinion, it just doesn't have that hook I look for in games.  
2026	1	a	Before I turned to Saints Row 2 for my fix of devilishly criminal fun, I played APB. And boy, was it nice. You had the option to be either the Authorities or the Criminals, and that right there is fun in and of itself. It gives you two character slots to start with and right there, I already knew I wanted one character for the Cops and another for the Crims.  The game plays out fairly laid back; you go around doing your own thing until you put yourself onto a list for receiving missions. Each mission is divided into several parts, and participants will be from both sides of the law, so the Criminals are going to try and complete objective A while the police try to stop them from completing it, and vice versa. Each mission is also heavily team-oriented so you'll always have someone watching your back as you complete certain tasks, or the other way around. You score in-game money and you can buy new weapons and ammo for use for a few days at a time, so it gives you a reason to keep earning money in-game. In general, this game's a fairly sandbox Cops-N-Robbers kinda game, and that's fun. You can also customize your character to an impressive degree, so you'll have a lot of options to choose from, which, also gets you to use up your money, as well as buying and customizing your own vehicles.  My only issue with this game is the sole fact that it is very much so 'Pay-To-Win' after a certain point. Sure, you could save up for this neat gun that you'll only be able to use for, let's say, a week. Or, you could drop some real money and buy yourself a rocket launcher that you can keep forever. thereby breaking any sort of balance between players. I mean, how do you defend against something like that?  All in all, the game is fun and if you don't mind the occaisional ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ with a pay-to-win weapon, chances are, you're going to have a great time. 8/10,
2028	1	a	This is a good game But It Have Hacker so That is not legit And when i found a hacker i left the game ok just fix the game about hack
2030	1	a	well... yea... kind of fun i guess...
2032	1	a	A great MMO. Wasted many hours on this game.    10/10
2034	1	a	Its a fun game to play with friends and even if you want to solo play. You can pull of many tricks by yourself and do many cool things that you cant do in any other game. 
2036	1	a	A great 'M.M.O.R.P.G.' type game, be a Crime fighter or a Crime do'er. got a Lot to Learn and do. Worth the time and money spent!
2038	1	a	Really entertaining and fun game!
2040	1	a	this is a good game becuase it has a uninstall botton
2042	1	a	♥♥♥♥ you Kenny I'm not playing this game....
2044	1	a	it the best
2046	1	a	Shoot cops in the face. Blow up their car. Take their money. 9/10
2048	1	a	good choice to play with friends or solo
2050	1	a	I have played APB for a long time. I have seen good changed and bad changes. The company in charge of running the game are small, as a result things don't progress as quick as the players want. The developers have good intentions though and some of the team are helpful.  The game offers vast and complex customisations for characters, vehicles and tagable points. The in-game editor is a powerful tool which allows some amazing work to be produced. The game is free to play and you are able to customise, however there is a crippling limit to the customisation you can do. The vehicles can have different parts and kits, in addition to looking as you wish, with your own customisation.  The community is something to be desired. As with any gaming community, you have your problem people. APB has many of these. The nicer people aren't so noticable, but are around. Due to the matchmaking and the behaviour of some players, this can make the game unpleasant for new players and may put people off before they can have a thorough go at it.  The clan system is simple and straight forward. You can easily add friends and block people. Additionally, the LFG system is helpful for new people or people who don't have friends who also play. But I highly recommend getting people you know to play, this game trully excels when playing as a team and that might possibly be the only way to trully enjoy it.  tl;dr - Not noob friendly. Stick at it. Immense customisation. Play with friends.
2052	1	a	This game is like an mmo version of GTA! except its bad. When you first create a character you gotta do some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥ tutorial and thats pretty boring, when you press K you get ready for a mission, and you'll most likely be paired up/against the following players: A hacker. A max level with the best gun in the game that can pepper your ♥♥♥ side ways. Or on your team a bad player that doesnt even know what the Left mouse key does. This game gave me cancer and now i need chemo therapy. Do not download this game, its a waste of time and i can't believe it touched my harddrive.
2054	1	a	APB Reloaded Is A Great Game A Simulation Of Gang Wars Vs The Cops Try This. NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART KIND OF PC'S
2056	1	a	sweet game the customization is like photoshop heaps of fun with friends or no friends
2058	1	a	Was great and gives you Tourette syndrome for the time being but after a while it gets old but it's your call I'm done with it I think...
2060	1	a	This is my honest review of APB Reloaded. This game contains 2 different factions which are provided with different attributes such as Different weaponary or different clothes/vehicles. The 2 factions are Criminals and Enforcers. I am personally a Enforcer on Patriot(EU2) so please take this into account before you play this game. I have played this game for around 440 hours as of writing this review so I can honestly say I have a good understanding of this game and its mechanics.   Firstly I would like to address the issue of people complaining about this game being pay to win, This game does have a big paywall in it however this does not mean that you cannot win with ease. An example would be the fact that you can purchase weapons from the Armas marketplace which costs real money however these weapons are mainly reskins of contact guns which can be purchase within game. To prove this an example would be the STAC 10 which is purchasble from the armas marketplace however this gun is no different to the Joker Carbine which is avaliable through contacts, the only difference is the skin on the gun. While there is guns such as the Scout version of the HVR which is avaliable on the Armas marketplace and is different to the contact version HVR you can usually pick these guns up via the Joker point system.  Gameplay wise APB is very good however the only problem with this is that the game has really bad stuttering problems even on low and high end computers. Another factor to take into account is that the game has no lag compenstation at all, personally I have only 32 ms on the server I play on meaning that I only get lag spikes from the server but otherwise I never lag however my american friend complains on how he is behind stuff and is still taking a large amount of damage as well as shooting people and him being unable to do any damage. I also know this is not a problem with ping as I play plenty of other games such as Quake or Unreal and none of these have this amount of delay.  Developers. The developers are extremely bad, They have not released a real improvement on the game in forever an example would be that there has been no new missions or objectives as well as no new maps or even contacts. There has also been no new contact guns only Armas weapons.  Final verdict === Give it a go... But I would not pay any money towards this game as the developers seem to have no interest in improving this game
2062	1	a	this game is relly cool i fink all of you shud try it
2064	1	a	why pay for GTA when you can get it for free =)
2066	1	a	ITS JUST LIKE MY GTAZ
2068	1	a	it takes FOREVER to load up but i guess its ok i do and dont reccomend it id rather play GTA5 but whatever. 
2070	1	a	It's so close to being perfect, only problem is the matchmaking, so unbalanced, but putting that aside it's actually a really really nice game, i love it, and its free!
2072	1	a	it didnt work, probs becuase i have Windows XP if you have above XP get ITS FREE!!  
2074	1	a	This game had some crazy issues upon release, and even more a bit into it. Hackers and ♥♥♥♥ everywere, was horrendous. That being said, getting a game where you and 3 other people completely dominate some crims/cops is the most satisfying thing ever. Good combat, good driving, great controls, amazing customization. Consistent polishing from the company is making sure this game gets better and better.
2076	1	a	This game is a very 'Action' 'Adventure' type of game, kind of like a GTA sort of game.... I like it!
2078	1	a	Verry nice and fun game to play
2080	1	a	Super Boy  
2082	1	a	I LOVE THIS GAME I GIVE IT A 1000/10!!!
2084	1	a	Not bad! kinda like a cheat version of GTA
2086	1	a	APB was a bad game to me at first, but then i started to play more hoping it would get better. And It did, the game (in my opinion) is not P2W i have bought single gun, and do better then most of the people i play against. So in overal, the game is really fun, besides the fact that missions are repetitive. The graphics are pretty nice, and really fun if you play with friends Via Skype. So download the game and message me if you want to play together :)
2088	1	a	its fine but laggy
2090	1	a	A Fun to play game but it has a lot of donors and bugs . BUT I LOVE IT :D
2092	1	a	♥♥♥♥ GAME CANT HANDLE BAD GRAPHIC CARD Yes
2094	1	a	slightly addictive
2096	1	a	Customization is great. Game is fun to play, and the community behind it is steller.
2098	1	a	Good, And Fun. But, Hard to Level Up and Get COOL STUFF
2100	1	a	Mini cooper trickz brah
2102	1	a	This game is very well made for what it is while there could be certain guis or other helpful tips to returning players I still find this game to be well designed and still has great performance without the large lag load that it seems it should.
2104	1	a	Want GTAV but don't have the money?  This is for you.   The funny thing is - apart from certain flaws - this game has more features than GTAV, like  in depth car/character customization  (Lowrider DLC for GTAV now has in depth car customiation for lowriders, like interior and exterior patterns, custom gearshifting stick heads, bobbleheads and hydraulics) and the choice to be a policeman/woman (without mods of course).  Sure, this game has some pay to win elements, but the thing is, those people who do this do not have time in their lives to rank up whetever it is the in game currency and buy the weapons from then.  If you think this game has no good f2p model, go check out blackight retribution, some of the guns in that game require you to fork out real money just to use it for 2 weeks with no option to keep the gun.
2106	1	a	this game is ok but it takes ♥♥♥♥ing forever to launch
2108	1	a	Everything good but the community mood, they are jerks
2110	1	a	It's a good game like a GTA online bute better. Graphics are kickass on maximum gotta have a descent rig too run it :P
2112	1	a	Awesome its a ONLINE CRIMINALS VS Cops!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Once me and my dad attaked a place and was DriVEING AWAY then a bounty Came on us then 32 people just came behind us and started raming us YOU SHULD GET THIS GAME!    
2114	1	a	Great game alone after some practice, most fun had in groups with friends if you can have it non-seriously. (Enforcer LTL teams for pure rage from others.)
2116	1	a	played ages ago, was pay-to-win
2118	1	a	I would've never left it if I wouldn't have bought CS:GO and PD2, and now, I'm back :) 
2120	1	a	It's fun to play this again on Steam after playing it back in like 2012. I quit back then because hacking was insane even though I really like the game. Being able to super-customize your character and their vehicle, what music you are blasting out of it is so rad. I don't know of any other game quite like it in those areas (any suggestions would be great :)  They have seemed to get rid of a lot of the hackers at this point. I didn't notice it as a problem. Note that you do need to get some upgraded guns one way or another in time... Prepare for a little bit of a learning curve on this FPS. Definitely not an aim-assist game.   My only thought is, after all these years we need more maps!
2122	1	a	the best game
2124	1	a	Great game!
2126	1	a	APB: Reloaded is a bad game. To be bluntly honest and to quote a friend of mine, it is completely criminal. (Not sorry.) But it has some redeeming qualities. It requires serious teamworking required to win some matches, some of the community isn't a CoD Fanboy yelling 'NOOB' or 'LOLGITGUD' and are willing to help new players be guided along their journey and the most well know part is that you can completely customize everything you own. Be it clothes, guns, vehicles, you name it, it can be done. APB: Reloaded, is and always will be until they change around a few things, a very bad game. But its a fun game to play with friends from time to time.  
2128	1	a	Good game very good game this is one of the best games :) download FAST
2130	1	a	Anyone can help me plz... :( why i can't play game i don't know why but i play game Debug :(
2132	1	a	I love this game. Great open world. Great multiplayer. Great combat. It's basically GTA.
2134	1	a	pls i want to know the song in the 4th video. now this game offfers everything ultimate custimization interesting gameplay its like a simulater its awesome
2136	1	a	Nice game :) I recommend it but for this game need better anti-cheat and team balance :) I Really like an Ref's. you can get awesome Gun, Skins, Clothing, Cars-Mods. There's is an few redeem codes :) I like active events :))) And you can get nice rewards from them ;))  So GL HF worth to try it

2142	1	a	This is a good game But It Have Hacker so That is not legit And when i found a hacker i left the game ok just fix the game about hack
2144	1	a	well... yea... kind of fun i guess...
2146	1	a	looks interesting sadly i cant get it to work, i might try again.
2148	1	a	i like APB reloaded cuz is so fun very good game for a free to play game 9/10
2150	1	a	NOT BETTER THAN GTAV BUT KEEPS YOU GOING INTIL U GET THE GAME OR IF U HAVE A SUCKY COMPUTER BUT SINCE I DONT HAVE A SUCKY COMPUTER AND IM WAITING TO PLAY GTAV ON DECEMBER 1 I STILL LIKE BOTH GAMES WELL DONE THUMPS UP FOR YA
2152	1	a	Guess I should start by saying I loved this game when I played it, was competitve, was new, and if you were better then someone it showed.  Pros- +Customization +Free2play +Decent sized community +Customization +Leveling system +Good Movement +Good Variety of things to do +Still updated today.  Cons- +Weapons are pretty lop sided +Can be seen as Pay2Win +Not friendly to new players +Driving  With that said I enjoyed every second and played the ♥♥♥♥ out of it, I understand the game can be seen as pay2win and I understand because some of the guns are no doubt better then the f2p ones. The matchmaking system is unforgiving it will put a new player against a group of veterans so beware. I always felt bad when I got put against newer players because I knew it would scare them away from a good game.
2154	1	a	Ok, so, I have a love hate relationship with apb reloaded because on one hand you have a good time playing and levelling up and completing missions and of course customizing your avatar. HOWEVER, the community is very negative and the matchmaking isn't always the greatest. You also have much less freedom as a f2p character versus a 'p2w' now I put that in quotes because you can do quite a lot with a f2p account however you will die, a lot. You will also die multiple times if you pay so it's really more of a 'pay more, play more' type of game. All in all though I do enjoy this game, even with all it's problems.
2156	1	a	its not relly free to play because ur restricted to certain things but it is is gd 
2158	1	a	Multipayer Grand Theft Auto, though not as epic as GTA its a cool copy.
2160	1	a	As far as I'm concearned, this game is not too bad. The graphics are epic and the level of customization is redicolously cool, but the matchmaking which is the most importan part sucks. It's just a random thing where you can gather like 2 cops vs 10 criminals. Excepting the MMs, the game's (car) phisics are just... welp, go better see by yourself!

2164	1	a	Here is a little 2015 update for those who find this game...  So if you get this game and start alllll the way at the beginning... you're basically ♥♥♥♥ed... unless you pay for your weapons but if not, you'll go up against nothing but golds in matchmaking, you'll get killed by all the best weapons, It'll take sooo long to get any money for good weapons or cloths that at that point you'll quit.   The only reason I'm still trying is because I'm playing with a friend and having a compainion makes it a bit easier. But once you go 2v1 against 1 gold you think 'Man this'll be easy, 2v1 no problem' until you find out he has the best weapons at clost range, and the best mods and your mission is to spray graffete in a building... There is no way you can win..  so unless your willing to drop some money to catch up or have friends to play with then I'd say try it but don't get your hopes up
2166	1	a	Jumped off a building and went through the ground and got banned for 'Exploiting'. 9000/9001
2168	1	a	why pay for GTA when you can get it for free =)
2170	1	a	This game is awesome! A must have! 10/10! This game is very fair to it's players!
2172	1	a	Yes i guesss for the bess
2174	1	a	You have to pay to get some of the really good weapons, but it is still very fun to play, especially with friends, I would reccomend getting this with some friends
2176	1	a	Tough decision, played since 2013 and had a few big breaks when my account was locked and when i didnt have the time and energy to play this game.  Simply i can say it's a   good   game, it is constructed in a nice way, a mix of fps and open world game which creates more action than for example GTA V with a smooth touch when you want to take a break from the action and customize your car/character, this is a very good example of double sided gaming where a game producer can earn alot in the community part.  PROS - Great game system with missions, i dont think that i have been bored at the game itself, more of the people playing. It is very funny type of missions which causes intensity and you can get heart clapping from not knowing where enemys pop up at the last seconds of a capturing mission - Funny game to grind in, you can put endless of hours in this game just grinding for that new gun or that new mod on your car, great level system - Double sided gaming, you can go from full action gaming to customizing your car in seconds, when you feel tired from all queuing and killing enemys you can use the money you gathered in going to the marketplace/auction house and upgrade cool stuff!   CONS - P2W, Pay2win game, you can either level up and grind for guns whilst someone buys them for real cash, sad but its needed for this game to stay alive. - Very mixed time zones, creates trouble when queuing, sometimes its full action on a server and some times there is nobody online, this creates bad matchmaking systems when you as a rank 1 gold can get filled with a silver team - Griefing is a normal thing, people often grief and you can never set up a street race without someone interrupting, constant people trying to glitch the game just to steal your enjoyment from the game  Summary is that this game is worth playing if you like these kind of free movement open world type of games, played about 500 hours and there is not a single hour i regret playing.
2178	1	a	you run around super edgy and try to out edge the police regardless of what side youre on youll buy the edge but youll only need the seat
2180	1	a	This is a really fun game and hope more steam users like it love the game and love that u can do what u wont with the game tattoos and close just love everything about the game
2182	1	a	Everything feels really good! I love the unbelievable amount of customizations you can make on your character. Fun game, overall!
2184	1	a

2188	1	a	this is a bad ♥♥♥ game
2190	1	a	basically like grand theft auto
2192	1	a	basically the free version of gta 5 and sort of gta 4 with no campaign mode and only multiplayer. The fact that it's free is amazing!, and you get the choice to be a police or a bad guy, unlike gta Overall. I really liked this game and the fact that its free is baws, so i rate it 9.5/10
2194	1	a	It's like GTA only cooler!!!
2196	1	a	A whole lot of people talk crap about this game but still play it, just saying.
2198	1	a	Great game, steep learning curve but it's awesome when you get better!
2200	1	a	this game is nice if you find some good friends (i got a free vegas and nitro 3 for free frm a maxed friend)even if its hard because of the amount of high skilled players/designers you dont need to spend a crapton of money (i didnt spends a single cent)and i find it fun to play even alone just ♥♥♥♥in around or doing missions or farming money ecc... but the ruskies and french fries are everywhere....plz put them in a ruskin / french server goddam
2202	1	a	I would really recommend this game to anyone! 
2204	1	a	veri gewd hit registy very god rng is the good one
2206	1	a	Tons of fun but feels like its missing something
2208	1	a	Good game, but i can't play it because i have problem with game i got from 15 minutes play i got lock up/ freeze and brrrr sound like a blue of death screen it's on bf 3 ghost recon future soldier and battlefield 3 and only on multiplayers
2210	1	a	Good, And Fun. But, Hard to Level Up and Get COOL STUFF
2212	1	a	Mini cooper trickz brah
2214	1	a	I recommend this game because it's fun and has INSANE customization
2216	1	a	This is awesome! WOOOOO crazy mob gangs!
2218	1	a	Want GTAV but don't have the money?  This is for you.   The funny thing is - apart from certain flaws - this game has more features than GTAV, like  in depth car/character customization  (Lowrider DLC for GTAV now has in depth car customiation for lowriders, like interior and exterior patterns, custom gearshifting stick heads, bobbleheads and hydraulics) and the choice to be a policeman/woman (without mods of course).  Sure, this game has some pay to win elements, but the thing is, those people who do this do not have time in their lives to rank up whetever it is the in game currency and buy the weapons from then.  If you think this game has no good f2p model, go check out blackight retribution, some of the guns in that game require you to fork out real money just to use it for 2 weeks with no option to keep the gun.
2220	1	a	The worst game I have ever played in my entire life, 0/10 would recommend to greatest enemy.
2222	1	a	1000000000/1000000000 best game ever i will play again
2224	1	a	Fantastic game, cool third person mechanics and a rich story with the online aspect as well, its not hard to gain money and the leveling system for unlocks is fun. Overall the only downside for me is you cant switch regions once you pick one.
2226	1	a	Really nice graphics :)
2228	1	a	Cool
2230	1	a	well, the first thing i can say is the best game ever! :D (for me, at least)  APB is a pretty good game, i could recommend it to anyone, but lets see the things in it that are good and/or bad  the good things in APB: +great character customization! +great vehicle customization! +great designing/designs +great gameplay! +great graphics!  the bad things in APB: -difficult for new players (bad matchmaking :( ) -some possible 'pay to win' weapons to buy for real money -a little bad optimization -very bad community (toxic community :| :x) -cheaters  about the community, there are still a few nice people to meet, but not much.. most of the players are a**holes on APB, but dont give your hopes up! ^^ overall, i think its a really good game, its worth to try it and play it!
2232	1	a	4565446546545665445645654656454645645456456456645
2234	1	a	♥♥♥♥♥ best, better than my BigMac, I hate KFC for this game.. i must make McAPB
2236	1	a	10/10 would play again. PS. I need a new game please.
2238	1	a	Terrible game, but free
2240	1	a	Eh, it was alright. Until I took an arrow to the knee ._.
2242	1	a	I've played this game for a long time, it has been great watching it grow, weather good or bad, The dev's of this game are very hardworking and in general sweg dudes. They have particularly worked on fixing the pay to win system, they don't care about money. Overall i would rate this a 7/10, its good when you start but after 500 hours it gets repetitive
2244	1	a	Pay to win.
2246	1	a	This is a fun game! try it!
2248	1	a	This game is so fun and it's not a pay to win free game you can get money easy and rent weapons for weeks i highly recommend this game for those who are fans of Third person shooters
2250	1	a	This is an awesome MMO Sandbox game. But the open world could have been better and the vehicle handling is just awfull. There are a lot of glitches that needs to be fixed. The graphics are good. As its free to play i recommend it.
2252	1	a	Awersome Game Nothing Else To Say.
2254	1	a	The matchmaking is ♥♥♥♥in' broken. 'Lets match up a level 30 against a level 226 in the bronze district!'
2256	1	a	Best Game i love it the graphics game play and all that a good game needs but hey its my review get the game if you want just play it stay with it or get out dont let the door smack your ♥♥♥
2258	1	a	Must invest alots of time into the game to be Good.
2260	1	a	Fun, rage...ish, but for god sake, MAKE THE CARS EASIER TO CONTROLL AND FASTER!!! 
2262	1	a	i saw a car and car going explode i got killed by that exploded i press alt+f4 and it cant force quit then i continued to play :)
2264	1	a	I hate this game so f*cking much, i cannot stop loving this sh*t. &lt;3 :'3
2266	1	a	Screw all of this 'microtransaction' stuff in the reviews. It just allows new players to get ahead quicker.   THERE AREN'T THAT MANY ****ING MICROTRANSACTIONS, YOU A***************************S   Edit: After actually playing the game for more than 2 hours, I have seen how wrong I am. At first, the microtransactions appear to be small. 'Eh, the decal limits fair.' 'It doesn't make a difference that most of the weapons are temps. After all, you get a free perma gun right off the bat!'  Then you start losing missions to premiums and guys who have the best of everything, because the match-making isn't 100%.  This game IS actually great most of the time, but it has its bad moments. Just don't punch your screen.
2268	1	a	It's not a great game, but it's not bad either. It has a lot of problems, mainly owing to the outdated engine, but overall it is enjoyable. People say it's pay2win but the default weapons are actually powerful enough that I don't think that's the case.
2270	1	a	A Great Shooter Game 'F2P' What more do you want. They got the hole package and for free... 
2272	1	a	Good and enjoyable game but the matchmaking is appaling. Gold max ranks in bronze districts... No chance.
2274	1	a	This game is awesome! A must have! 10/10! This game is very fair to it's players!
2276	1	a	Okey heres the deal, this game is a hackers sandbox....with potential. All the old players understand that this game is good, it can be played for free even if its not ideal, and the customisation is what realy sets this game apart, but them hackers tho  Honestly when this game has cleared that problem up then this game will be great again, for any old player has played those matches without hacks were genuine skill were what counted and enjoyed them
2278	1	a	Its a game
2280	1	a	It's sad how pathetic this game is.
2282	1	a	I Recommend this game for multiplayer and online lover it is (THE BEST ONLINE GAME ON STEAM) 
2284	1	a	played it on my old pc and i'll play it again!
2286	1	a	Better than GTA5
2288	1	a	this game is such a piece of ♥♥♥♥ i ♥♥♥♥ing hated every planck instant of me playing it, it's ♥♥♥♥ing torture and i mean full disrepespect to the braindead monkies who keep it alive to this day. die.
2290	1	a	One Of The Best F2P games i ever played.
2292	1	a	Dunno why even call yourselves Gamersfirst. Moneyfirst sounds more fitting. All in all the game is ♥♥♥♥ ton of fun until you run out of ♥♥♥♥ing premium which is a bunch of ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. I'd rather pay for a game like this only if it didn't have this overwhelming ♥♥♥♥ing money hoarding circlejerk running it.
2294	1	a	Best game to shoot up some crims or enforcers. Bought this game when it first come out, now that it's free to play? Made my gaming complete. This game will keep you on your feet shouting for more!
2296	1	a	best game, we all know it, like a drug once u go in u never come back ( in general)
2298	1	a	+ Fun game. - Idiotic community. - Pay 2 Win. 
2300	1	a	I will say that this is a good game, and I fairly enjoyed it while I played it. HOWEVER, there is a Pay-To-Win thing that you can't miss. YOU WILL DIE to people who are higher leveled, or have payed money, but it's an MMO, you should expect that. Then again, it could have an auto balance to where you fight people who are only your rank or close to it. But this is a fantastic game for it being free. I prefer this over GTA online any day!
2302	1	a	I want to play it but it wont let me at all!! It just takes me to facebook page which i already like and the game wont load at all!!
2304	1	a	P2P Well, that's what we all want so I guess this deserves a Yes review huh?
2306	1	a	played it for a little while. it's not bad.
2308	1	a	pretty good game (it is really hard to get guns) 
2310	1	a	BillyTheKid is come Back Lows !
2312	1	a	Possibly better than GTA... It has more content, it's free, and you can do more of whatever you want. Also awesome graphics and artwork.
2314	1	a	gta for cheapos like me
2316	1	a	Butts mcgee and mr.pedro
2318	1	a	This game is great for those with patience. I started playing this when RTW was still alive and I will play it untill the end. This is a unique game that you cant really compare to any other. It requires you to actually learn the mechanics and use it to you're own advantage. If you cant evolve well.. Lets say you will get a lot of time looking at death screen. The only problems with the game are : 1.Community 2.Lazy G1 Yea you will get opposed against a hacker every now and then but that wont impact the gameplay too much. The trolls will troll like on other games just that in here they are less creative. And G1 works really slow regarding emprovements to the game. If you can look past these minor things like me, then my firends you will have a blast!
2320	1	a	It's not fun if you don't pay money for it, just sayin..
2322	1	a	this game.... ugh.......
2324	1	a	♥♥♥♥ me in the ♥♥♥
2326	1	a	If you're looking for fun, I guess this is a good substitute.
2328	1	a	Awesome Game!!!!! It's Reall Fun To Be A Criminal Too In The Game :D
2330	1	a	Best Online Game Ever. If you like GTA series, then you would like this game too.
2332	1	a	preety cool game 
2334	1	a	this is in a way a online grand theft game... but i like it more you get to drive cars/kill people steal and other fun ♥♥♥♥. in a way its pay to win but you can win with out ingame ♥♥♥♥ :P
2336	1	a	played it on my old pc and i'll play it again!
2338	1	a	Like breaking the rules? Get this game Like cops and robbers? Get this game  11/10
2340	1	a	this is a great game for gta likers or cop vs crimals that dont want to spend there money but this for me is a great game i played it ALOT but there is two warnings this is sort of a pay to win and this will not work on some types on computers.
2342	1	a	Awesome Game!!!!! It's Reall Fun To Be A Criminal Too In The Game :D
2344	1	a	pretty good game if you like to play GTA online alot! like me.
2346	1	a	This is ta best game ever ! i love him &lt;3
2348	1	a	its fun to play and its good but there is hackers.
2350	1	a	Best game in the ♥♥♥♥ing world!
2352	1	a	I LOVE THIS GAME I GIVE IT A 1000/10!!!
2354	1	a	Not bad! kinda like a cheat version of GTA
2356	1	a	---
2358	1	a	this game is amazing, play it 
2360	1	a	This game is freaking awesome! Basically it is grand theft auto with better graphics, you can be a law enforcer or a criminal, and the animations are freaking awesome! No means to compare but this is one of the best games I have played.
2362	1	a	Not bad, Needs to Update the Graphics settings.
2364	1	a	Hands down, my favorite MMO. Tons of action, great customization abilities, awesome gameplay. And yes, it may be rampant with hackers, but it's still tons of fun to play
2366	1	a	Very cool looking game and really fun when playing with friends. The downside is that it is pay-to-win and in most cases when doing a mission you just want to give up and to get the full experience you have to buy premium. In my opinion I think there should be a permanant premium so you wouldn't be having to waste money just to play a great game.
2368	1	a	Awesome game but if they could make the requirstemt little lower for lower pc or laptops.
2370	1	a	i love the game but u guys have to ♥♥♥♥ing fix the bugs and crashes come on are u people that ♥♥♥♥ing lazy 
2372	1	a	If you don't hack in this game, it's pointless to play it.
2374	1	a	Amazing free to play multi player FPS
2376	1	a	I Love the game becuse it is like cops and robs 
2378	1	a	Although the game isn't what it used to be there are still some epic moments to be had.
2380	1	a	Pay 2 win game , dont play :3... Low player
2382	1	a	GTA 5 &lt; APB Reloaded KappaClaus
2384	1	a	A very, very fun yet with a touch of seriousness, this first-person shooter based in a dystopian city called San Paro that houses two factions, known as the Enforcers and the Criminals, where each side brings it's own vigilante justice to the table. Pick your faction, build up your arsenal of tough weapons and vehicles, and progress through your faction's ranks. The game is extremely customizable, more so than any other game on the market that I've seen. Customize your character's looks, your vehicles, and even create songs to play in your own portable radio. The game has it's own functioning economy, and players can pay high-end in virtual currency to purchase artistically designed items, such as death themes, songs, clothing, and symbols. All the while, this game is completely free! The only down-side to this game is the pay-to-win philosophy. Players have the option to purchase weapons, vehicles, and other features which are able to boost their playing ability from a site known as the ARMAS Marketplace. However, if you have deep pockets and an interest in dominating your opponents, you have the option to buy some bang-for-your-buck items and perfect your character.
2386	1	a	Really nice game.
2388	1	a	very cool for a free game
2390	1	a	one of favorite games so far !
2392	1	a	The game is fun, but done leave the startign server until you have a few guns. The game is free to paly and you can buy guns with in game cash but its not permenent. You can buy a gun forever but it will cost a good amount of real would money.  Game play is nto bad. It can get fairly bad when someoen puts money down and others dont. Also you done use scopes, They are for looks only =/
2394	1	a	Now, I bought this game back in 2009. Yes, bought. $50, spent another $10 for 30 days of action district time. I had managed to obtain 6 months worth of action district time by selling Portal themed vehicles in the marketplace for subscription currency (it wasn't illegal, they had actually made a system for it). When this game was revived by GamersFirst, all of us who bought this game retail only got our original characters back as compensation. But... all of our character stats had been wiped. Why am I telling you this? So you'll be surprised to say that, despite being screwed over, this game is still addictive and fun enough to still jump back in and play from square one. Its an exceptionally fun game if you play with a good group of friends or a clan and use voice communication as well. Tactical team gameplay is a must for this game. If you have a coordinated team of players who use excellent gameplay tactics, you will hardly ever lose. A recommended download.
2396	1	a	This game is very strict on who plays it, if you like a certain thing but not something else, you may not want to play this, It depends on the player. I play it and i love it because it literally is nothing but random fun!
2398	1	a	
2400	1	a	This game is fun to play BUT make sure you have a good frame rate cause it could get lag but overall it a fun game to play
2402	1	a	'Free To Play' Just means you play for hours on end dying nonstop just to eventually unlock an alternative pair of underwear (SIDE NOTE: There's only one kind of underwear you can get unless you wish to pay 'reel muneez')  --Update: You can get a different kind of underwear for 10 in-game points--  26.5/9.9999 I'd play again
2404	1	a	Great game alone after some practice, most fun had in groups with friends if you can have it non-seriously. (Enforcer LTL teams for pure rage from others.)
2406	1	a	played ages ago, was pay-to-win
2408	1	a	I would've never left it if I wouldn't have bought CS:GO and PD2, and now, I'm back :) 
2410	1	a	It's fun to play this again on Steam after playing it back in like 2012. I quit back then because hacking was insane even though I really like the game. Being able to super-customize your character and their vehicle, what music you are blasting out of it is so rad. I don't know of any other game quite like it in those areas (any suggestions would be great :)  They have seemed to get rid of a lot of the hackers at this point. I didn't notice it as a problem. Note that you do need to get some upgraded guns one way or another in time... Prepare for a little bit of a learning curve on this FPS. Definitely not an aim-assist game.   My only thought is, after all these years we need more maps!

2420	1	a	its good
2422	1	a	This game is So awsome i really recommend playing this if u love cops and robbers, teamdeath match games
2424	1	a	veri gewd hit registy very god rng is the good one
2426	1	a	It's not a game I would Smash!
2428	1	a	Good game, but i can't play it because i have problem with game i got from 15 minutes play i got lock up/ freeze and brrrr sound like a blue of death screen it's on bf 3 ghost recon future soldier and battlefield 3 and only on multiplayers
2430	1	a	Its ok
2432	1	a	good people,good gameplay,good game.
2434	1	a	APB is one of the best games out of steam. I would kind of compare this game To Grand Theft Auto V because you can be a criminal and mug people and do missions to earn $$$. You can either be an Enforcer(Police) or Criminal. Its an Third Person Shooter. Really Fun Get it. Its also free on steam. BTW the game is made by some of the Gta Developers.
2436	1	a	kinda screwy, if you put some effort in, youll like it.
2438	1	a	♥♥♥♥ HER RIGHT IN THE ♥♥♥♥♥
2440	1	a	Realy good game to spend your time and money on.   Pay2Win..
2442	1	a	I Have played this game for over 200 Hours and i dont regret it. The market part of the game is the best although this game can turn into a pay to win sometimes.
2444	1	a	#1 Police Brutality Simulator 2014. Passable gameplay, slightly pay-to-win, but its really the character customization options that keep you coming back for more. Well, that, and shouting 'STOP RESISTING' while driving an El Camino through a crowd of bystanders.
2446	1	a	Not bad...confusing, but it plays nice and it looks nice. Not bad.
2448	1	a	this very god 
2450	1	a	*Hmm looks good* *Installs game* *Waits 2 hour to complete download* *Sees that theres another download* *Takes over 20 mins to download the other installer* *Clicks Start* *Warning file says: Have you downloaded apb correctly?* *Game closes* *Clicks play from steam library* *Nothing works* The legend says,That hes still,trying to download the game.  FFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
2452	1	a	Great job almost feels exactly like gta 
2454	1	a	i havnt really yet played this game but it makes me hard so thats a good start
2456	1	a	Don't listen to the meta score on this game, it's had hugh updates since then, one of the most fun games i've played in a long while, better with friends. It's an MMO with no need to grind, just have fun.
2458	1	a	very nice game have a nice grapchic play and enjoy your rules 
2460	1	a	*reviews say mostly positive...scrolls to bottom to read reviews...sees mostly negative, even the recomended reviews are negative* my opinion is try it and see for your self, yes it is mostly pay to win, and yes it is not realistic, and overall yes its broken...but mostly by the community and crappy servers and lag...to this day its still fun to play though, and a few things make this game worth playing such as: its free so try it!, you can import your own music for use (to a point, seeing only you and others with same music can here it), but the best of the game and the funnest part is the unparrallelled (dunno how to spell) customization in every aspect of your character, cloths, and vehices. I've never seen a game with customization like this one before as it doesnt compare with any other game, just look at my screenshots for a preview. Overall: This game is worth trying out in the least
2462	1	a	i can install it its really upsetting
2464	1	a	Best game in the ♥♥♥♥ing world!
2466	1	a	It is like GTA and it is a funny game to play, 11/10
2468	1	a	This game is awesome! A must have! 10/10! This game is very fair to it's players!
2470	1	a	Yes i guesss for the bess
2472	1	a	You have to pay to get some of the really good weapons, but it is still very fun to play, especially with friends, I would reccomend getting this with some friends
2474	1	a	Tough decision, played since 2013 and had a few big breaks when my account was locked and when i didnt have the time and energy to play this game.  Simply i can say it's a   good   game, it is constructed in a nice way, a mix of fps and open world game which creates more action than for example GTA V with a smooth touch when you want to take a break from the action and customize your car/character, this is a very good example of double sided gaming where a game producer can earn alot in the community part.  PROS - Great game system with missions, i dont think that i have been bored at the game itself, more of the people playing. It is very funny type of missions which causes intensity and you can get heart clapping from not knowing where enemys pop up at the last seconds of a capturing mission - Funny game to grind in, you can put endless of hours in this game just grinding for that new gun or that new mod on your car, great level system - Double sided gaming, you can go from full action gaming to customizing your car in seconds, when you feel tired from all queuing and killing enemys you can use the money you gathered in going to the marketplace/auction house and upgrade cool stuff!   CONS - P2W, Pay2win game, you can either level up and grind for guns whilst someone buys them for real cash, sad but its needed for this game to stay alive. - Very mixed time zones, creates trouble when queuing, sometimes its full action on a server and some times there is nobody online, this creates bad matchmaking systems when you as a rank 1 gold can get filled with a silver team - Griefing is a normal thing, people often grief and you can never set up a street race without someone interrupting, constant people trying to glitch the game just to steal your enjoyment from the game  Summary is that this game is worth playing if you like these kind of free movement open world type of games, played about 500 hours and there is not a single hour i regret playing.
2476	1	a	you run around super edgy and try to out edge the police regardless of what side youre on youll buy the edge but youll only need the seat
2478	1	a	This is a really fun game and hope more steam users like it love the game and love that u can do what u wont with the game tattoos and close just love everything about the game
2480	1	a	Everything feels really good! I love the unbelievable amount of customizations you can make on your character. Fun game, overall!

2494	1	a	Never beat this one. Wasn't sure which gun was the APB, so I'm pretty sure I never reloaded it. Sorry.
2496	1	a	(The first sentence is a lie, I wrote more then I thought I would. Sorry!)   I'll do a short but sweet review, the game is quite enjoyable, though at times can be a huge pain. I enjoyed it at first, as I was going through the tutorial till I had to do an objective (baiscally a mission, but there are 2 sides to this game criminals and cops, you need to do it for your side) As I got closer to the objective, I'd repeatively die dozens of times, even get spawnkilled by police, their level so high, they shouldn't have been in this zone!  I gave up, logged in the next day. Things went flawlessly and there was no annoyance, I did the objective and the game got more fun once again. So, even though I had a HORRIBLE time at first, I'm glad it's overwith now, and I'm having much more fun with the game - at the same time I know this game can go back to ♥♥♥♥ too.  So, I reccomend trying this game out on your own, the installing is a bit odd, but after that, see if you like it! If you do good! If not oh well! Mixed reviews are always tough, try it out and see for yourself, and look up gameplay too if you're deciding whether or not to get the game. Hope this helps! Just remember if it's bad, try it at a different time. And it can go from wonderful, to hell. In an INSTANT (Keep that in mind)  P.S This went longer then expected, so ignore my starting of 'short but sweet' hope you enjoyed!
2498	1	a	very, very, very rage inducing. Hackers and lots of them.....Pay 2 Win.....
2500	1	a	this game is ok
2502	1	a	decent game, good for people who cant afford gta.
2504	1	a	APB RELOADED is very very good games 
2506	1	a	This game is really fun. Though im really bad playing it with keyboard. Think im going with xbox 360 controller ( which i believe its good for some people like myself ). I recommend this game to anyone interested in 3rd person shooting games. Play if you like GTA, Sleeping Dogs and Crackdown
2508	1	a	Okey so reviewed this game way back in its CBT and just when it went live on steam, now its had time to grow and all tho alot has changed and stuff has been added its still no where near the lvl i would like them to be , however thats not to say the game is bad i was hooked to this game clocking in well over 200 hours before i even made the jump to the steam version   the only downside to the entire game is that the rendering system as well as the draw distance and the massive buggy engine made the game dip alot , at first it was overrun by hackers Then that was dealt with in the coming months , now its just performance dips and bad memory leaks , now since the time i did play this ive upraded my PC and it runs alot better at least better than it used to i think , either that or its not optimzed alot for 600 series cards and above from nvidia , but nether the less the game will be fantastic when the new engine update hits  AT LEAST we all hope so , for all we know it could get messed up just like everything else does most of the time they release new stuff.  as for the P2W aspect everyone keeps saying... hmmm yeah i can see that even tho i have spent money on the game around £200 worth but its defo P2W no perm weapon avaiable in game that you can actually earn or buy from contacts , and dont get me started on the weapons on the market , i sold my nano the day i got it when the joker box hit , sold it for $7.4Mill and its just as worse as today , obciously any new free player aint ever going to be able to afford that let alone afford a 1-2 Slot weapon etc fora 10 day lease , it was hard to make that money at start and it still is
2510	1	a	Like breaking the rules? Get this game Like cops and robbers? Get this game  11/10
2512	1	a	this is a great game for gta likers or cop vs crimals that dont want to spend there money but this for me is a great game i played it ALOT but there is two warnings this is sort of a pay to win and this will not work on some types on computers.
2514	1	a	APB is great for a while, then it falls off after doing the same missions and driving the same cars over and over
2516	1	a	choo choo
2518	1	a	i enjoyed it very much but it does kind of fall under the p2w category sadly but over all it was pretty good
2520	1	a	Game has sluttering issues not recomended for raging kids. By the way game is pretty great with friends but poorly optimized and lazy.  Developers won`t fix it by the way Switch Graphics to high Game Lags because on low you have small viem distance loading thats why it lags You switch graohics to high and it will less lag.
2522	1	a	Great game if you want to rage and die every day
2524	1	a	Cool,i need to make this game the new china im gonna set up 1 billion dollar walls around it XD jk
2526	1	a	its very fun game 
2528	1	a	The customization part of the game is really nice...you can almost make anything of your character, same for vehicles, gameplay wise is cool, would be nice if it had more cities to play though.  If they could remake this with newer engine and get some marketing on it...would be nice
2530	1	a	Cool,i need to make this game the new china im gonna set up 1 billion dollar walls around it XD jk
2532	1	a	I Reccomend This To Anyone Who's Good At Third-Person Shooters Because There Is No First-Person In This Game. I'd Say It Has Lag Problems For Most People But That Won't Stop Them From Playing As A Criminal Who Can Break Into Side-Stores, Mugging Citizens, Or Even Doing Missions- All To Earn A Bit Of In-Game Currency! The Criminal Definately Has More Perks As To 'What To Do' When Not In A Mission Such As I Mentioned Earlier: Mugging, Breaking Into Stores And Stealing Goods, And Spray-Painting Walls. The 'Enforcer' Seems To Only Have 3 Options. Doing Missions (Against Criminals), Arresting Criminals, Or Catching Criminals Doing A Crime (You'll Go Into A Mission To Stop Them). There's PVP Too, As Well As A Shopping District. Thank You For Your Time In Reading This!  PROS: + You Can Shoot Out Of The Window Of A Car! + Customization Is HUGE (...If you have premium)! + Stunts With Cars &amp; PHYSICS! + Be A Criminal And *Rule the District!* + As A Criminal, You Can Ram Stores For Their Stuff! + MUGGING! YAY! + EMOTES &amp; DANCES! + In-Game Character/Car Mods! + Players Can Be Decently Good And Will Own You (Most Of The Time, If You're A Criminal)  CONS: - Lag/Lag Spikes. - Tryhards, Trolls And ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s! - 3rd-Person View Only. - Some-What Hard To Master PvP. - Friends List Limit Seems A Bit Small (imo). - Customization Limited Without Premium :( - Can Sometimes Be Pay-To-Win But Not Always. - Some Guns Can Be Overpowering And Unfair To The Other Team. - Limited Group/Team Number: 4.
2534	1	a	I will recommend to all my friends
2536	1	a	Freshly installed - Failed to launch Reinstalled - Failed to launch  Tried launching over 10 times, each time it had a different error  This is a literal pile of dog ♥♥♥♥  Thanks Gamers Last, you had me thinking this was a game at all
2538	1	a	Amazingly Addicting! A bit repetative though.
2540	1	a	If you are looking for a game to play with some friends, then this would definitly be a great choice. They finally fixed some of that lag and the game seems more bearable now. The main complain I hear a lot is: 'It's pay to win.' which (from my experiences) is false. The main weapon you have (that you get from the very beginning) can still out gun any other weapon on the game, it's just about skill now. But if you get really into customization like I did, you'll find yourself spending more money then you would have just buying a whole new game. They also finally started catching on to hackers, and if a majority of players report them (from the server) or a mod catches them hacking, they are automatically banned and globally humiliated (tells everyone on every server that they got banned for hacking) and they are also working on an engine update.   As the engine update is still far from release, we can just deal with the games current physics and matching, and just hope for the best in the future. Overall, the game is great and I would recommend any one looking for a casual game or people with artistic abilities to play this. It's great for so many different things, and with all the new features being added until the release of the engine update, we have more and more to enjoy every day.
2542	1	a	Hmm, it's not bad. Not quite up to the standard of GTA, but it's not a bad timewaster and quite fun.  Controls could be improved, as you are unable to steer the vehicles with the mouse (WHY??), and the maps could be bigger, and there should be more choice in vehicles (a 7.5ton delivery truck as an improvement over the van might be nice?).  But in the end, it's a fun MMO with little lag.
2544	1	a	a fun game but they do have some balanceing issue(really bad issues) but i had a blast overall so i recommend this
2546	1	a	Cool game despite the cheaters laggers and noobs.. :D I love it 10/10
2548	1	a	Great game !!!!!! so ducking fun play it now!!1
2550	1	a	It's a Pay-to-Win, knock off, GTA MMO. Honestly, I put a good 30 hours or so and 5 dollars into this and i was amused.  It isn't 'Bad'. It works. Surprisingly well. I say give it a try. It has some great, unique ideas and i think you should put maybe 3 hours or so into it before you knock it. But it is VERY pay to win. alot of the customization stuff takes a long time to unlock, and everything is very slow. it feels incredibly grindy. still pretty good.
2552	1	a	graphicks suks
2554	1	a	Great games it is fun but there is hackers every where
2556	1	a	this game is like gta4 and 5 in like a... its to awesome to describe words, GET IT
2558	1	a	This game has made some great strides lately and I have enjoyed it so I guess I will do a small review.  Pros  - You can only play with other golds, silvers, etc if you are that particular rank - Art Design as a nod to Crackdown - Open World featuring 3 Original Districts, 4 if you count Social - Heavy Ingame Character Customization - Ability to upload your own music into the game  Cons  - Awful Optimization and Settings Customization - Lack of GMs and Moderators to help ban aimbotters - Pay to Win Cash Shop - Repetitive Mission Design  Well, this is a difficult one to rate, I really enjoy my times in this game but the aimbotting is just plain awful. Hackers are rampant, the Cash Shop is the most Pay to Win ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t I have ever laid my eyes on, but the overall gameplay and customization is smooth and fun.  7/10 - If you are bored, download it and have a bit of fun.
2560	1	a	get this ♥♥♥♥n game its free and awsome!
2562	1	a	Reminds me of GTA
2564	1	a	eh i dont like type of games like this one but its ok... also its a free game so i reccomend it
2566	1	a	Time to go trucking.
2568	1	a	  its a really nice game, a little bit repetitive but hey, its free...
2570	1	a	Recently APB has been saying my Nvidia drivers have something wrong but I've got an AMD Radeon and the drivers for it.... so I'm unable to play the game other than that it's a great game
2572	1	a	better than GTA online 6/10.
2574	1	a	Its alright. The games flaws become apparent the more u play P2W as ♥♥♥♥ All guns in store have same model as normal varient, just has better dmg (OP stats) Game is pretty dead Max levels derank to silver to play on bronze servers for easy xp and kills   Still worth it.
2576	1	a	hi can you fix the APB reloaded it go all the way to the video and thin is go black
2578	1	a	Great game 100000000000000/10 /spoiler  
2580	1	a	APB Reloaded is a game that takes a little bit to get in it's not for the easy players who just like to chill. but if you like a challange this game is perfect for you. it does have an amazing amount of creativity to the game. so i'd give it a 6 out of 10
2582	1	a	it's a game that exists, isn't that good enough?                                    really you'd only play this for the customization, but that's besides the point
2584	1	a	Gets frustrating at times, but once you get into it and feel that you're actually getting good at the game it's a really awesome game to play :)
2586	1	a	.
2588	1	a	  I personally would reccommend APB, but it all is balanced on what server you play on, because ive gotten servers that were total B.S. but one thing I do like is that you can customize the cars to some extent....
2590	1	a	the game is great
2592	1	a	Pay to win.
2594	1	a	Can surf on car  10/10
2596	1	a	I have played this game so much time , i like it but on my pc is sometimes laggy :/
2598	1	a	1. Steal a car 2. Crash the car into a shop window. 3. Rob the store and load the car. 4. Deliver stolen goods to black market dealer. 5. Repeat process.
2600	1	a	'Click' Noice ;)
2602	1	a	This game is great, especially since it is free. It is basically GTA free to play!
2604	1	a	it may feel like its p2w but its not... you do have your glitchers and a few people who run around with bots, and a TON of high level players at times, but its made by the creator of GTA.... so it is bound to be somewhat fun.... anyways.... ilike the fact that when you jump in your car, you can jam out to your own tunes...... so when your in a mission that reqires you to protect you can bump some luda and move b&amp;*#$s out the way lol but yea.... it is worth it and there are a few fre premium day codes for starters as well... so for now...thumbs up
2606	1	a	How can i get leg armor :(
2608	1	a	I LUV IT. Thats All Folks
2610	1	a	one of the greates GTA online out There
2612	1	a	Good game that is a little bit hard at first, but after you get a hang of it, it's really fun. People will always cry about P2W in F2P games, but here, it's nothing you can't handle with an average gun and some skill. Character customization is epic and probably one of the best in today's gaming.
2614	1	a	lol its alright
2616	1	a	How do i fix that .dll error?!?!
2618	1	a	This game is like GTA but its multyplayer and you choose your army.The police or viliance.So every gamer who like gta must install this game.I love this game and every good gamer must instell this game.
2620	1	a	Lots of fun, if you don't mind a cops &amp; robbers style FPS that is somewhat 3rd person. Along with the fact that its VERY pay to win based. Playing it F2P is still tons better than almost every other F2P game that has P2P options.
2622	1	a	Its APB enough said
2624	1	a	Love this game to death. If you're a fan of GTA.. GET THIS! &lt;3
2626	1	a	kinda reminds me of GTA, but just cops and robber stuff
2628	1	a	i got killed by a car touching me 20/10
2630	1	a	Cool game despite the cheaters laggers and noobs.. :D I love it 10/10
2632	1	a	Beat by p2w and hackers plays on slow internet one second delay when i press key and when guy does action for some reason i still play 
2634	1	a	  reminds me of early Saints Row
2636	1	a	What I do is I get in my sweet lil Vegas 4x4 and flip any mfker I see. Ppl call me Geniusboy.
2638	1	a	Matchmaking sucks balls
2640	1	a	Good game when you spend a little money on. :) Worth the wait of downloading
2642	1	a	I really like the game, but I couldn’t find the stupid cake.
2644	1	a	Pay to win.
2646	1	a	IT S HORUBLE 
2648	1	a	SURPRISE! IT'S BACK!
2650	1	a	it's ♥♥♥♥'in amazing
2652	1	a	APB is a better GTA. Ton of customization from your toon to your car. Its very addictive. Dont lissen to the trolls on here. Sure you can buy guns for real cash but what ftp dont have that. but keep in mind the noob starting gun is just as good as a $40 cash gun. Its about your skill no the gun.   I have to admit that there is a lot of trolls. A lot of players talk ♥♥♥♥ about the game on the fourms but yet they are playing the game 7 days a week. If the game is soooo bad then why do they keep playing it?   For me this game gets a 8/10 Great customization, Great over the shoulder FPS action.
2654	1	a	A decent game its free so its already worth it
2656	1	a	I love this game. Customizations are amazing. Been playing since it came out with RTW, and still love it. It's simply a lot of fun. There are only two drawbacks: its poor optimization with major in-game latency on occasion, and the occasional hacker found in any shooter.  For those saying it's 'pay to win,' it's not. You can create a brand new character with a stock gun and easily kill a max level character who has paid for every single item on them. Guns have their perks and their drawbacks. It's all about situational awareness, knowledge of the map, and general experience with this game. If you keep yourself in situations that are beneficial for your gun type, you can kill anyone. There are not many games out there in which you can do that, especially ones which are free.
2658	1	a	From when i used to play this game their were quite a few graphical errors but the gameplay was almost always exilorating and not to mention for a brief time one of those errors allowed my car to fly so 7/10 give it a try and decide for yo self but i for the most part liked this game the customisation was very in depth the guns were decent even if you did have to spend ages to get a permanently but thats not a real big issue guns for the most part were cheap and cars were fun except for the first one which was terrible.
2660	1	a	this game is cool
2662	1	a	This game is sick!
2664	1	a	GTA V free ALOT OF CUSTOMIZATION 9/10
2666	1	a	Oh my god, please. Just get the game. 11/10 'Let's Be Bad Guys' Simulator 2014   No but really tho, get it. Sure, weapons can be bought for money, and other people have money and blah blah blibbity blah, but you can get them for free... It's like planetside, but it's cops and robbers. Who the hell doesn't like cops and robbers?!
2668	1	a	who like GTA5 most try this game you can drive play mison play music to funn stuff and more :D
2670	1	a	yes cause Facebook sucks 
2672	1	a	This game is quite similar to Grand Theft Auto and it is free!
2674	1	a	i played with my friends apb relodead and it is a awsome game i suggest to play this game with your friends
2676	1	a	Its a good game to play, the ability to be cop or criminal is quite good and the customization is quite vast, it would have been alot better had guns and some vehicles not had a 10 day expiry, and if cops started with a gun used to stun criminals and arrest them, however they can be overlooked as its quite entertaining to play
2678	1	a	Love This game!
2680	1	a	the game in itself is really good! i like how you can customize your character, your weapons, and your car. its almost unlimited what you can do with a few shapes and colors. so 8/10 there!  what really ruins the game, is the matchmaking system.. you can be rating 14 (you start at 1) and get against people who are in r200+.. wich is just crap.. you got the standard wep against a dude who has something that kills you alot faster..  then there is the hacking.. i'we seen multiple people getting killed by 1 guy while he jumps and spins and dances.. there are just not enough focus on hacking.. i have search'ed the internet for places to buy aimbotting and wallhacking. its really easy! and it cost almost nothing! its a good game.. but GamersFirst has ruined it. back when RealTimeWorld had it, it was much more fun to play.. it has become a money machine.. and G1 dont care about those who really want to play the game.  so i will give APB 7/10 and GamersFirst 1/10.. they are ruining a really good game.
2682	1	a	It's some fun, objective based cops and robbers. The game can get a little repetetive, but you can't beat the price since it's free to play. I've noticed the game doesn't have 'pay to win' problems.
2684	1	a	When I first played it, it wouldn't even load. I am going back to try again and hopefully it works.
2686	1	a	epic game but can also cause major rage if in unstable mood lmao
2688	1	a	This is a really good game
2690	1	a	ive played alot of free to play games in my time aand i rate thsi one number one by far
2692	1	a	One of my favorite games to play. Originally created by one of the creators of GTA. The most customizable game on the market, built in photoshop programs so you can design any symbol and customize your car, and character as complex as you want. Plus they're working on a new engine upgrade this year for unreal engine 3.5, so the graphics and gameplay are only just about to improve!!! GTA online doesn't compare to APB:Reloaded!!!
2694	1	a	decent game, good for people who cant afford gta.
2696	1	a	this game is the best i sweer
2698	1	a	This game is really fun. Though im really bad playing it with keyboard. Think im going with xbox 360 controller ( which i believe its good for some people like myself ). I recommend this game to anyone interested in 3rd person shooting games. Play if you like GTA, Sleeping Dogs and Crackdown
2700	1	a	Okey so reviewed this game way back in its CBT and just when it went live on steam, now its had time to grow and all tho alot has changed and stuff has been added its still no where near the lvl i would like them to be , however thats not to say the game is bad i was hooked to this game clocking in well over 200 hours before i even made the jump to the steam version   the only downside to the entire game is that the rendering system as well as the draw distance and the massive buggy engine made the game dip alot , at first it was overrun by hackers Then that was dealt with in the coming months , now its just performance dips and bad memory leaks , now since the time i did play this ive upraded my PC and it runs alot better at least better than it used to i think , either that or its not optimzed alot for 600 series cards and above from nvidia , but nether the less the game will be fantastic when the new engine update hits  AT LEAST we all hope so , for all we know it could get messed up just like everything else does most of the time they release new stuff.  as for the P2W aspect everyone keeps saying... hmmm yeah i can see that even tho i have spent money on the game around £200 worth but its defo P2W no perm weapon avaiable in game that you can actually earn or buy from contacts , and dont get me started on the weapons on the market , i sold my nano the day i got it when the joker box hit , sold it for $7.4Mill and its just as worse as today , obciously any new free player aint ever going to be able to afford that let alone afford a 1-2 Slot weapon etc fora 10 day lease , it was hard to make that money at start and it still is
2702	1	a	So much fun.... Like gta but with other players as the cops and very intence tacktical misions thoughout the game.
2704	1	a	This game is prob GTA but free it is great to play and the customization is epic.
2706	1	a	This game is great, especially since it is free. It is basically GTA free to play!
2708	1	a	I saw the reviews, I've played the game for quite a while now, And yes, I am still a silver, But the community isn't that ♥♥♥♥♥♥. The ♥♥♥♥♥iest thing that I saw was someone typing 'OMG NOOBS' in the chat once when we lost, but that's it..  Also, yes, the game IS P2W, but I didn't pay a single penny and I'm doing just as fine and enjoying the game.   This game is definitely a fun game, And you can enjoy playing this easily, even if it is P2W.   -The almighty Paban.
2710	1	a	ran around doing nothing 10/10
2712	1	a	10/10 would play again to be killed by aimbotters.
2714	1	a	Drove a car, it fell through the ground.  10/10 not bad
2716	1	a	It is a very good game
2718	1	a	Epic F2P GTA Kinda game! :D
2720	1	a	it's an alright game.
2722	1	a	yes but in same time no ... game is good i mean so many things what u can do but .... servers have lags or idk ..is it game or what ? but i have 40 mb/s and pc 8.5 stars .... yet i lag or bug idk
2724	1	a	awesome game almost like a free version of grand theft auto
2726	1	a	lol its alright
2728	1	a	its not relly free to play because ur restricted to certain things but it is is gd 
2730	1	a	I liked the game for its ease of use and its fun to play with friends, when they can find me in the inworld map :)

2734	1	a	best game to play,iam addicted
2736	1	a	Nice game, expecially with friends, most ppl may dislike it because it needs a time to understand it. Almost every weapon can be used without the need of paying real money. All items are reachable without some cosmetic items.
2738	1	a	The game has customization like I've never seen before, a simple way of playing, and many things that make it a very money inducing game. The hacker problem is pretty much fixed at this point, but beware the edgelords. I think it's addicting enough, so I'm giving it a 9/10. Also, worst customer support in existence.

2744	1	a	ive played alot of free to play games in my time aand i rate thsi one number one by far
2746	1	a	decent game, good for people who cant afford gta.
2748	1	a	this game is the best i sweer
2750	1	a	APB Reloaded Is A Game Full Of Violence And Crime. Which Means Good, It's Like Playing Grand Theft Auto 5 But More Violence And The Guns Are Really Cool. You Can Edit Cars And Costumize Your Character..... I Give This Game A Thumbs Up! After Playing It, It's Really Good, A Lot Of Users Killing Each Others. Enforces Vs. Criminals. Two Standards! The Standard Of Crime And The Standard Of Justice.  I Really, Really Like This Game! I Recommend This Game For You Guys, So Many Guns And ACTION!
2752	1	a	Awesome game in my opinion, the character creation is great and it is really fun. The only downside is the hackers and lag. All in all a good game I would recommend if your into the Third Person Shooter kinda stuff.
2754	1	a	&lt;3 it so much
2756	1	a	Many people think I'm hacking , but I'm not . 11/Gentleman Sausage
2758	1	a	You can become a gang member in this game.
2760	1	a	sick game
2762	1	a	  The game is great,but the physics aren't that great especialy with the cars.
2764	1	a	It's not a great game, but it's not bad either. It has a lot of problems, mainly owing to the outdated engine, but overall it is enjoyable. People say it's pay2win but the default weapons are actually powerful enough that I don't think that's the case.
2766	1	a	Cool
2768	1	a	Cool! Is Better Than Gta 5 Becouze You Can Do More Tings That Gta Dont Have
2770	1	a	it looks good i just cant play it wont let me log in 
2772	1	a	It's a Pay-to-Win, knock off, GTA MMO. Honestly, I put a good 30 hours or so and 5 dollars into this and i was amused.  It isn't 'Bad'. It works. Surprisingly well. I say give it a try. It has some great, unique ideas and i think you should put maybe 3 hours or so into it before you knock it. But it is VERY pay to win. alot of the customization stuff takes a long time to unlock, and everything is very slow. it feels incredibly grindy. still pretty good.
2774	1	a	Fun and somtimes crazy Cops and Robbers simulator.You need to get this!
2776	1	a	'I really like this game. Its like wow in teh sense of a good and bad side, but awesome like grand theft auto! best yet,its free!' - Stewix
2778	1	a	♥♥♥♥ this gay game it would not let me play i could not chose a world
2780	1	a	Its as optimized as a field mouse running through death valley in search of a tree, has combat that's about as enjoyable as getting castrated (or castrating others) with a rusty spoon, the weapon balance is intolerable, and the missions can be extremely onesided most times.  Vehicles can be fun sometimes though, so 10/10
2782	1	a	IT S HORUBLE 
2784	1	a	I bet Its a good game just my computer cant handle it
2786	1	a	This game is like GTA but its multyplayer and you choose your army.The police or viliance.So every gamer who like gta must install this game.I love this game and every good gamer must instell this game.
2788	1	a	Made me kill my whole Family    10/10
2790	1	a	Ehh. It's decent. Barely played.
2792	1	a	I want to play it but it wont let me at all!! It just takes me to facebook page which i already like and the game wont load at all!!
2794	1	a	I love the gameplay.....its pretty awesome
2796	1	a	Great open world game that have a lot of things to do and very funny with freinds (recommended playing with freinds to level up fast and earn money like hell)    DONT LET THE COPS SEE YOU THAT A LITTLE TIPE TO SURVIVE FOR LONG TIME  omg.COPS!!   RUN  RUN  RUN   BEEING CAPTURED BY SEXY POLICE GIRL!!   10/10
2798	1	a	♥♥♥♥♥ best, better than my BigMac, I hate KFC for this game.. i must make McAPB
2800	1	a	After 1 flip car blown up 10/10 would flip it again
2802	1	a	didnt even get it and im execited XD
2804	1	a	Purgatory Simulator 10/10  Will still wait for engine update.    In all seriousness, I love this game, and I have put an absurd amount of money and over five hundred hours into APB:R. Hands down, one of the more unique games on the market, with plenty of oppertunites to make your character truly your own with the customization, etc...  However, I have come to find that I cannot enjoy playing a game with horrendous FPS dips and overall lag issues. As much as I have honed my skill and mastered my weapons in the middle of an intense firefight when the frame rate drops to four or less per second, that can take all the fun out of a game. I want this game to have balance between player and free from those who abuse or manipulate the game, making it drab for everyone. Lately when I log on I cannot play for very long before the urge to quit sets in.   If you can handle unpredictable frame rates and crippling latency issues, then I would definately recommend.
2806	1	a	I started playing the game openmindedly and well yeah, Id highly recomend this game! Its alot of fun! Bit confusing at times and some aspects aren't the best but overall is a great game to play!
2808	1	a	SURPRISE! IT'S BACK!
2810	1	a	This game is amazing. I made an african american character and put chicken legs and racial slurs all over my car. Great game overall.
2812	1	a	i love this game!! best free to play game!
2814	1	a	Fun game and its even better playing with your clan mates and friends. The graphics arent bad but the game is not very well optimized. There are still a few hackers but FairFight does a good job at banning them. Overall great game!
2816	1	a	Very good and REALLY entertaining game that can hook you up for weeks or MONTHS! And also free, but I also reccommend premium time since it is worth it and adds to the fun :) I played it months before it came to steam and I am satisfied, now they patched it A LOT, and believe me - it is very enjoyable :)
2818	1	a	This game is a F2P open world crime game.You either chose to be a Criminal or an Enforcer.There is plenty of clothes and items to customize your character and one of the best parts about this game is it's advance customization.People can make their guys look like a ♥♥♥♥ing gook to a damn pokemon.When I go to the customization district,people are dressed up like it's ♥♥♥♥ing halloween.   Not only you can customize your character,you can customize your cars.Tons of cars and customization features which keep this game alive.The only bad thing that comes with cars is driving.Driving can be really sluggish and unresponsive if you're trying to get from point A to point B.   The main thing you have to do in this game is depending on which role you are.If you're a criminal,you can either rob a store or hack an ATM.If you're a cop,you can help bring justice to these holigans in brooklyn.Depending on the missions for money,you can do side missions.For example: robbing a store and bringing back to whoever you're pledged to or mug a white guy.   Although this game is incredibly fun at times,it can be a pain in the side.When you're doing a mission and you're new to the game,so you have starting equipment.The people who oppose you are people who pay for premiumn so as a result,they have better OP weaponary,which makes the game really unfair and not fun.   In conclusion.this game is really fun unless you're versing some holigans that have premiumn.If I had to rate this game from 1-10 I would rate it a 6.5.Tons of customization options,tons of clothing,tons of cars but tons of people who have OP weaponry.     
2820	1	a	You all have got to try out this game if you haven't yet. It is Awesome!
2822	1	a	BEST GAME EVER !!  Runs awesome  plays awesome  
2824	1	a	looks good apv features include: wont load cant load never loads wont start wont give erections wont do any thing
2826	1	a	'Review a game' Srsly tho, try it out, except for the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ graphics and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ player base whining all day long and tryhards with OP weapons that has never been nerfed and never-ending devilish matchmaking system, this game is worth a try.
2828	1	a	Beat by p2w and hackers plays on slow internet one second delay when i press key and when guy does action for some reason i still play 
2830	1	a	this game is the best i sweer
2832	1	a	ye gangstas and whatnot
2834	1	a	So much fun.... Like gta but with other players as the cops and very intence tacktical misions thoughout the game.
2836	1	a	it fun with friends and Great team work
2838	1	a	What GTA V tried to be.
2840	1	a	Best Game i love it the graphics game play and all that a good game needs but hey its my review get the game if you want just play it stay with it or get out dont let the door smack your ♥♥♥
2842	1	a	awsome game :p
2844	1	a	OMG this freking game is so much fun the real life sucks but the life in APB is much funner and its like gta but free 2 play if you and i will have fun in the APB world and remember to love APB
2846	1	a	Its a very good game you should play it
2848	1	a	Its Verry Cool and Verry Cool Weapons
2850	1	a	Best free roam EVAR! Just like GTA V Multiplayer but BETTER!  Drive in style by customizing your cars, clothes and weapons! RPGs Included!   aint nothing better than trying to drive like Paul walker in a game &lt;3   R.I.P Paul Walker
2852	1	a	It's MMO. Your chioce to be addicted or leave it.
2854	1	a	Really fun game. No idea why it has such a bad reputation on Steam.  Awesome character customization. Great gameplay experience. ALOT of fun, even if playing Solo. And this game is NOT p2w.  Even with all these negative reviews i tried the game myself and i love it. Would recommend it!
2856	1	a	Dunno why even call yourselves Gamersfirst. Moneyfirst sounds more fitting. All in all the game is ♥♥♥♥ ton of fun until you run out of ♥♥♥♥ing premium which is a bunch of ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. I'd rather pay for a game like this only if it didn't have this overwhelming ♥♥♥♥ing money hoarding circlejerk running it.
2858	1	a	OH MY GOD. It's not on Linux?  I am dissapoint.  Still, it's a pretty damn good game. It's great for beginners who just want awards most of the time. I already have the permanent gun on my 1st day of 4.
2860	1	a	Ive been with this game before it came out on steam and when i first came out the amount of progress that have got into this game is amazing im still playing this game and i wont stop playing until all servers are shutdown or n new stuff comes out but yes i recommend this game  Pros and cons Cons: The game is really hard to play and you need to have Voce communication Its recommend for this game and that you also need to put time into this game when you start out You will die alot but over time you will become good at this game  Pros: The Customizeing in this game is out standing you can go into so much detail into this game its unbeliveable also with the graphics are old but they still look good the Car driving is also amazing ome cars are really hard to controll but you can get used to it easyliy You can play with Freinds also You will be able to roam any where in the world and you will be able to join in events to earn quick and fun rewards after completeing the event   Now theres a couple of bugs with in this game like sometimes seeing green background or the audio is Cracking up or you will see the servers are down but theres 30 people in the server the server is still up you can still join just saying   I HOPE THIS REVIEW WAS HELPFUL HAVE FUN PLAYING :)
2862	1	a	  ♥♥♥♥ 
2864	1	a	there is nothing to do
2866	1	a	BEAST I LOVE it
2868	1	a	loads of hackers s kicked the game of my system with in a few hours
2870	1	a	The game: I did  -Played in a group  -Enemy group leader said gtfo
2872	1	a	It's a really good game and the only one in it's specific genre (Yes GTA is similar but this mmo style experience and the story are completely its own.) It's great to play free, an rewarding to spend a little cash. Both are available options, and you may do either. There are some issues, matchmaking needs work, lack of support can be frustrating and the prices for paid content can be ridiculous. But the pro's outweigh the con's.  If you want to be in a sandbox game where you can design almost whatever you please and be almost anything, this is a good game for you.
2874	1	a	this game.... ugh.......
2876	1	a	My goodness. After 18 hours i can say the game is good but. The people in it give me ♥♥♥♥ing aids.
2878	1	a	i play the hell out of it on xbox, awful by the way. No idea whats wrong with it, devs just dont care i suppose. But i put about $40 into it when it came out on xbox. Hate to start over on PC, however it plays like a game. Youre not limited to how many tats you can put on your character (3 on xbox, used to be 40 like it is on pc).
2880	1	a	Oh yes! :D     I rate this game 10/10
2882	1	a	massively multiplayer GTA!~!
2884	1	a	Very fun game but hopefully I can get a PC/Laptop that play this game soon.
2886	1	a	What is there to say about this game.. hmmm.. APB is a mixed bag of nuts so to speak. There's some in there you want and some you wish were never in the bag. This game has tons of depth in terms of customization, but lacks in more important areas such as matchmaking and weaponry. A lot of people say this game is Pay 2 Win. It's true, but at the same time it's false. You can easily purchase a new weapon in 3-5 missions. Even the stock weapons can prove their usefulness up against a $30 G1C(Real Life Money) Weapon. I've been playing this game for a really long time, around 2 year On and Off. I can safetly say the server's stability has definitely increased and fixing the FpS lag is as simple as deleting a folder or disabling Realtek. PunkBuster is one of the crappiest HackShields available, thus hackers are abundant, however, from my latest experiences, I haven't noticed any. In fact, I've been called a hacker more times than I've actually faced one. Honestly, on a scale of 1 to 10 on how pro i am, I'd say 6.5 flat. This game has so much potential, but just lacks the key components to really make it successful. I JUST recently dropped $40 into this game and only because they had a 50% off sale. Also, my Threat level is Gold, so apparently the game thinks I'm good. (Threat levels range from Weakest to Most Skilled as Green, Bronze, Silver, Gold ).   Key Factors in this game that keep me interested and to why I'd recommend it : ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ #1 - Ragdoll is numbah one-san. #2 - The Customization makes me drool. #3 - Open World PvP Combat ( You can even see other players fighting without being in that mission ). #4 - The Storyline is pretty unique. #5 - A lot of fun when you play with friends or find a decent group of players. #6 - You don't HAVE to spend real $ to be good. #7 - The selection of vehicles if quite vivid, each being specialized in different areas. Driving takes a while to get a hold of however, especially a select few vehicles. #8 - Modifications to enhance your weaponry, character and vehicle to your liking whenever you unlock them. Mods are thankfully permanent. #9 - Great in-game soundtrack featuring popular artists such as Clutch &amp; Pendulum. #10 - You can arrest people? That's the ultimate troll pwng power possible! P's!!  Reasons to avoid this game : ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ #1 -Rare Occassions - There's hackers. #2 - It's not very new user friendly which can immediately turn someone off. Lacking a legitimate tutorial, though the objectives are pretty obvious, it's not THAT difficult to understand what to do. #3 -Matchmaking is awful, don't expect to go up against new players or players around the same level as you. #4 -Broken Guns : This one i'll have to explain. Some weapons in this game seem to excel far beyond other weapons in certain specifications. Example, a slow firing SMG should not be able to take out a fast shooting LMG at 5 meters. #5 - Character models don't move in the most fluent way, so aiming at opponents can prove very difficult, especially when lag factors in, causing them to teleport. #6 - Weapons and certain Vehicles only last 7 days. Pretty stupid.( UNLESS you pay real $ for a permanent one. Which i'd say is another reason i wouldnt recommend this game ).  Overall, the game deserves credit where credit is due, but hate where it's mostly needed. 7/10
2888	1	a	Its not leting me play it for some reason?
2890	1	a	i shot a fish 10/10, would shoot again 
2892	1	a	This game is awesome for be free!

2898	1	a	240 hours and I finally got past the loading screen!
2900	1	a	It's a fun and immersive game. I'd suggest playing it.
2902	1	a	Robot Response:  This game is online PvP only.  I would class this game as semi-competitive.  This game has one of the best customization systems ever, you can make your cars and character look AWESOME..... or just put a giant ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on the side of your van and your characters clothes.  Why play the game? So you can beat a guy and his friends 1 match out of 3 and have him spam you with 'you little B***h', 'you suck', 'kill yourself' messages, then watch their names appear on the public name and shame list for hacking a week later.

2904	1	a	Though released a while ago, this is a rather enjoyable game. While graphics may suffer in comparison to newer games it has a grand theft auto playstyle accompanited with an alliance system (Officers and Crimincals). The game is very user friendly, a wide array of tools and assests at your disposal. The game is very customizable with visuals featuring a remniscient emblem creator like from the black op, call of duty series.   PROS: Highly Customizable, User Friendly, active community CONS: Moderate Graphics, Pay-to-Win, Weapons 'Expire'
2906	1	a	Buy premium for this game if you're rich or hipster or both
2908	1	a	This game is alot of fun

2928	1	a	Now before you write this off as a fanboy review, hear me out. Don't listen to the negitive reviews, this game is a ton of fun.   It plays a lot like GTA Online but in a free to play format. That sounds like a nightmare, i know, but it really isn't. It's kind of grindy, but that is to expect from a F2P game. Don't expect to have to play 100+ hours for a single item.  There is an endless amount of character and vehicle customization, this is half the fun for me. A really interesting thing they did with vehicles is how the radio works. You can import your songs and play them through the car, like the 'personal' radio channel in GTA. But wait, it gets better. Everyone in and around the vehicle can hear what you are playing, so the farther away the car is the less you can hear it. AND if you have the doors open(ie. when you are parked), the music is clear, and when the doors are closed, it's muffled. That's a very small thing to mention, but i like the attention to detail for this kind of stuff. I play this game myself and have made a few friends through this game, and it's a lot more fun if you have a friend to play with. Now, one of my favorite parts is that the chat is uncensored. It's hilarious.  Now for the bad:   The devs are almost non-existant. They're there, but updates are few and far between.  Hackers. They pretty much drove the game into the ground. The amount of people that play is low compared to any other similar game. FairFight keeps getting better, so there are a lot less hackers than there used to be.  And lastly, the textures and models are a little dated, gameplay could use some refining, and there are only 2 main maps. That being said, you are playing in a giant city so i can't complain wbout having more than one map.  If you can get past that, it's a really fun game to play, plus it's free, so it's definitely worth trying.  All 'n all, I would definitely reccomend this game.
2930	1	a	This is why I drink alcohol and I can't stop playing it it's an excuse for me to drink alcohol
2932	1	a	This is one of those games I always find something to complain about when I play it, but am still playing it after 4 or 5 years. I've yet to max out a single one of my three characters as I mostly play casually and have been known to take hiatus from the game multiple times for 6+ months at a time. Despite that, I always seem to find an itch to come back to the game and play it.  In it's current state, the game features many details that could be considered flaws, yet it's uniqueness somehow keeps many players still playing it after many years. It's a game where other players can easily frustrate you, but you can still find yourself having fun.    Most   of the cash-shop items are cosmetic - even the guns are mostly reskins for the most part. Players can pay for a 'Premium' subscription which dramatically increases their rate of money and exp income, however that doesn't necessarily appeal to everyone. However, Premium players do get a noticeable discount on other cash shop items, so it's advised that players spend money on a Premium sub before anything else in the game's cash shop.  The game has the lousiest hit-reg ever as there is no distinction between a perfect headshot or a laggy bullet scraping the barrel of your gun - both will kill you just as quickly. It can be very frustrating, however it does force players to consider a more favorable aspect of the game involving location and weapon strategy. Most weapons in this game play as rock-paper-scissors for the better part of playtime. You can outsnipe a player with an LMG or even a shotgun on some lucky occasions, but ultimately a sniper has the upperhand in a long-distance fight with someone waving an SMG around. However, just the same, a sniper can win a surprise attack with a pointman (again, on lucky occasions). This brings up the importance of locational awareness. Players who know how to adapt to nearly every part of each enormous district map are more likely to survive or succeed an ambush attack. When you consider how all those elements weigh in on each other you eventually see how it can actually be a pretty fair game, however many players will be bad sports if they don't have the time or resources to adapt to an upperhanded player or situation.  I'm not going to comment on the community itself as their are lots of opinions about that already. I will say that if you try to take this game seriously or if you are very competitive, you will probably find your experience in this game to be most distressing. If you can find entertainment in getting your ♥♥♥ whooped thousands of times, come aboard - you might even be good some day when you start paying attention to why. Also being able to find the fun in having the occasional obvious-cheater kick your butt will also help keep you from sounding like an annoying child on the district channel chat.  As a final note, the game's threat system is severely broken and abused. Here is the best way to find out which district you belong in: Start in Bronze Districts - then when you realize that isn't challenging enough, come to Silver Districts. Ignore the other districts. 'Gold districts' and 'gold players' are really pointless things to complain about as GamersFirst (aka G1) has yet to do anything about keeping gold players in their special, golden playpen - so it's just a matter of understanding that players play in either Bronze or Silver districts and that is all you have to rely on, for now, regarding 'difficulty gauging.' (The premise is that 'It's lonely at the top' and so gold players are able to join and play inside silver districts, but not in bronze districts.)
2934	1	a	its kinda fun if u play with friends
2936	1	a	good thir peson shoort
2938	1	a	crashed on startup.
2940	1	a	great game to play, tho you can very easily can get banned or kicked from joining online servers, for doing the petiest things wrong...
2942	1	a	better than crack  9/10 would pay to win again
2944	1	a	Oh man, what a great time I had playing this game.  For me, the P2W system is pretty balanced beacuse everyone dies very fast. To add, the vehicles and the environment are ''detailed'' in some way.  Great customization. Great time. Great buy beacuse it's free.  GGGTA
2946	1	a	Best Character Custimizor, but the game is pretty dead...
2948	1	a	Fun Cop vs Robber type game. Try for own opinions.
2950	1	a	Around 4000h on it, I simply want to recommend this game, writting a review about it is a true challenge lmao.  If you're looking for a Free2Play game not Pay2Win at all, you've found one!  This is NOT GTA. Nothing like GTA. But a nice Arcade open-world Third Person Shooter with MMO rank mechanics.  You can use your starter weapons from the start to max rank without any problem.   Feel free to add me if you need any information/help about it. (begging for money / items not included)

2954	1	a	APB will bend you over every chance it gets and does not take no for an answer. Everyone is against you and no one is trustworthy, even your own teammates are likely to kill you. Closet hackers, premade high rank teams, and hundreds of foul mouthed Trolls who hacusate and whisper you walls of negative text are what you can expect from this game. It truly is a PvE game where everyone is out to get you. The odds of success in this game are slim as those who are still playing it have thousands of hours invested and feed on the endless waves of new players who promptly uninstall.    I recommend this game if your skin is 2 inches thick and you feel no pain from an open flame. Even the highest end PC will not save you from performance problems as a good hand full of them are server side issues. The chances of you playing this game for any length of time are slim to none and the odds you can convince a friend to invest more than a courteous amount of time in game with you is nil.   Player beware you are on your own.
2956	1	a	I like this game. I like it better then GTA for reasons, You guys should try this If your looking for something better then GTA.

2968	1	a	amazing game, only problam is the server fps keeps going up and down ;(
2970	1	a	I played ever since the very first company went under and since then it has only gone down hill, sure you can play it but is it really worth your time and money?   Because you will want to spend money and you will spend it after seeing all the fancy astetics of the game I've probably spent over $150 mainly for making cars look sexy...yeah I should've spent it on guns to compete with the other pay to play gamerino's but those muscle car skins are just sooooooooo bootyful!  Don't download it! It was great at one time but since then the servers have gotten worse, the player base is dead and the only people that continue to play are for lack of a better word, VIRGINS!  But I recommend it :)
2972	1	a	i havent played it yet
2974	1	a	If you can look past the poor security the game is pretty fun. ^^ Best customization in a game I've ever seen!
2976	1	a	It's free to play, just try it for yourself. WHY ARE YOU READING THIS! JUST DOWNLOAD NOW AND PLAY IT NOW FOR FREE!!!!
2978	1	a	Good game, but I hate how you have to buy buy almost EVERYTHING with real money, and they don't make any attempt to separate new people, from people who have had the game for years. Level 3 going against level 60, and they don't give any chance, you suck, that's to bad. So I would reccomend this game if your good at 3rd persons and you have tons of money.. other than that it's a pretty fun, and good game.
2980	1	a	Game is Good, graphics should improve
2982	1	a	Amazing game which surprisingly isn't pay to win if you are skilled. You either be a cop or a thug, customize every single detail of your character and join the fun ! :)
2984	1	a	If this game didn't gobble down RAM like a fat lady gobbles down cake, it'd be okay, the mere fact that I (with 4 GB of RAM, and better than 'recommended' specs, cannot walk 3 feet without the game locking up for about 4-7 seconds goes to show how horribly un-optimized this game is. I did some research on the mass RAM eating this game does and found out that the developers don't release any customized player textures from memory after said person disconnects.. Yup. You will keep the textures of every. single. person on the server in memory even after they disconnect, so you'll create this massive cache in memory of textures. I expected this game to be able to handle lag well too.. Nope. Driving with lag is nearly impossible since there is a whole 2 second delay between pressing the turn key and my car actually turning. Horribly optimized game, seems like it is only still online to get cash for the devs/publishers.
2986	1	a	amazing game, only problam is the server fps keeps going up and down ;(
2988	1	a	You people need to understand the Game is FREE TO PLAY TO PLAY which means you can play the game for free that does not mean everything is free stop complaining you got the game for free and you can play be happy
2990	1	a	best game in the world

3074	1	a	This is a great game but there is a big lag in some parts of the world in the game I dont like the lag but great game i like how you can creat your own character anyway you like thats the best part! Keep up the good work APB Reloaded creaters.

3084	1	a	much graphics very music so pew pew pew wow
3086	1	a	This game took away one of my best friends.   I don't know where to begin. This game is a great concept built upon a terrible foundation. The pipes are busted and there is asepsis in the attic yet the place has a great mountside view. Despite that you're better off just pulling the copper from the walls, taking everything that isn't nailed down, and finding a nice place in the suburbs. If there is a worse gaming company than EA it is G1 with their overpriced pay2win guns. $40 dollars for an OCA with a silencer on it? Psh, I could use that as a down payment for a total gym or buy a water filtration system for some obscure third world village. If G1 actually worked on balancing the game, reducing the bugs, and stamping out the hackers (the real ones) then this game would be amazing.   In APB your creativity is only limited by the number of greenbacks in your wallet as unfortunately the more extensive character design is restricted to subbed players. Even with all the balance issues the game is surprisingly addictive and enjoyable however those with heart conditions or anger issues should stay clear for APB, if not the game itself then the hate-filled community, will make you make you want to break things. As Niner said, this game probably accounts for 90% of all domestic abuse in the country.   Did I mention the venom spewing community? Right, basically everyone who plays this game either has a superiority complex or ate glass prior to launching the game. Whether winning or losing, everyone feels the need to push you into the mud. There is no such thing as a good sport in APB.  Yet despite all the negative I would still recommend playing at least once. This game struck me and I still want to keep playing regardless of the restraining order.    Final review: 2/10 - This game gave me cancer
3088	1	a	Great mmo!
3090	1	a	Good game that has balance issues. The devolopers could fix it but prefer to get the money instead.
3092	1	a	it' s GTA... but for free :)
3094	1	a	If you love Saint's Row or GTA, you'll love this. Fully customize your characters, weapons, and vehicles
3096	1	a	Its a great game *cough* If you do the missions.
3098	1	a	Ruthless.
3100	1	a	1.2k hours of pure fun. 4 years of pure fun. it changes alot so memories start flying
3102	1	a	IT IS AWESOME! THE GRAPHICS AND PHYSICS ARE UNBELIVEABLE!
3104	1	a	my laptop plays this so yeah :) Dont stalk me pls
3106	1	a	This game is great! The car and clohting mechanics is great. This game has live up to its slogan be all you can`t be. If you a more competive gamer i should recomend CS:GO OR DOTA 2 this is a more casual game.
3108	1	a	beast
3110	1	a	grate game can be improved With in game shop
3112	1	a	very very cool game but need a very good pc for it
3114	1	a	APB Reloaded, a poor mans GTA.  Well... this game is full of angry prepubescents that will shoot you in the back even if you're on the same team, fun time right? It gets better! Zero match making, P2W, and did I mention everyone is an A!!hole? It's chaos on the streets GTA style with more focus on the crime and vigilante justice.
3116	1	a	Amazing all around, DEF worth your time.
3118	1	a	the best free-to-play on steam in my opinion
3120	1	a	#Since beta #1000h+ #Awesome  ~ I love you APB
3122	1	a	Robbing people and places with your friends is fun, especially the ones who have been robbing the people blind. Some say we are modern day Robin Hoods and others they just dont understand that we have a choice. Newton once said 'For every action there is always a equal and opposite reaction.'. This is our reaction, am i a criminal i dont think so, everyone needs a job right?, we all need a Payday.
3124	1	a	If you like rage inducing games, pay to win and somewhat fast paced 3rd person MMO then this is a game for you.
3126	1	a	Lag Free, Optimized, Not pay to win, and NO HACKERS.
3128	1	a	I feel like there are a few quirks with the game, and a few imbalances as well, but for the most part the game is enjoyable. I do wish they gave enforcers a bit more to do when they aren't running missions, and I would like to something new with missions, a lot of them are the same.
3130	1	a	Its a pretty good game honestly (i accually have 600 hours they didnt record becasue it was only recording the luncher program) so i invested alot in this gaem probs more than i should have but i say money well spent, if you get sick of somthing you can move on on to somthing new its just a game with endless fun.
3132	1	a	Good Game for free 
3134	1	a	im download the game but i think its good 
3136	1	a	APB Relosded is the best game ever. i liked beacuaes it is one of those games like this is my world like that that is why i love this game
3138	1	a	Great game. I wish i could play it
3140	1	a	You get into a dump truck and slam people's ♥♥♥♥ in whiling listening to classical music. Aside from that I cannot think of anything else that is good about it. Grab a friend and ♥♥♥♥ around for 3 hours.   10/10 'game of the year' - IGN
3142	1	a	buy my music
3144	1	a	Really Fun with my wife lol
3146	1	a	I really love this game! It's very very fun and easy to get addicted to, especially once you start making friends. And the community is amazing!   What is the gameplay consisting of? Think of GTA Online, except you can play as the criminal or cop, plus custimization is beautiful and similar to that of Saints Row 2 in a way, meaning its really open and you are not limited to small variations to the preset. leveling up pledges takes time, but thats what makes it good, is that its not like you can do it all in one day and get bored after you finish everything.    All in all it is a fun game, and I highly reccomend it.
3148	1	a	It's free to play, stop looking for those crappy bad reviews. PLay the game see if you like it.
3150	1	a	APB? more like ABP Ad block plus. Anyway the game is awesome
3152	1	a	Awesome but not recomended for laptops with 4 gb ram
3154	1	a	This is very good and cool game +1 Need to Play
3156	1	a	My neighbours complain when i die.
3158	1	a	This game will make you love Vanilla Cookies. Don't ask questions...
3160	1	a	Pretty good game, but kind of hard to make money if you've only just started.
3162	1	a	Lag the ♥♥♥♥ out of my pc  ....................../´¯/)  ....................,/¯../  .................../..../  ............./´¯/'...'/´¯¯`·¸  ........../'/.../..../......./¨¯\  ........('(...´...´.... ¯~/'...')  .........\.................'...../  ..........''...\.......... _.·´  ............\..............(  ..............\.............\...
3164	1	a	Great game! Try it out its free, nothing to lose, great graphics, gameplay and a lot of different customizations.
3166	1	a	Probably THEE WORST GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED in a very long time.  For starters, the download times are extremely long and pointless. By the time this game got running and I was actually able to do something, I could have had GTA V finished half way through.  The cut scene in the beginning was hideous and you can tell they didn't put proper work into it because they showed scenes were players were clearly laggy,l which isn't good to promote (obviously)  As if loading times weren't bad enough, customizing my character wasn't easy. I didn't know what to do and customization wasn't really big. When it finally got into the game (after asking me if I was to be an enforcer and criminal) I tried customizing the controls to my PS3 controller (Xbox 360). Did not work as I hoped. I couldn't use the thumb stick to steer my car, when I tried setting L1 and R1 to my turn signals (because there are no other useful controls to set them to) the button would be set to that and something else that I had no Idea about. And even though there isn't a lot of controls to use, they have a HUGE menu sorting into car, driving, shooting, on foot, menu, and 5 more category that are completely useless. So controller wasn't an option.   As for graphics, very very boxy. I see the game came out in 2011, so I would hope that this company (if still alive) would either make a new game or update the graphics on this one to at least look promising to use. I understand it is free and have limited employees and resources but make the game .50 cents and get some money out of it so you can actually update the hideous graphics! The game is dull and always looks like night time. I can't tell you much about the community, I know it says I've played for almost and hour, but 90% of that was figuring out how the game actually works.  Does not require a heavy PC. Moving your character to aim and shoot will be impossible. So get the game. If you like RPG. And can't afford GTA V.
3168	1	a	i have not played it yet ut i havve seen it on youtube and it looks good its like GTA
3170	1	a	Awesome game!  Very fun and alot of customization! This is the game I've been looking for! An open world MMO Free to Play Game! 
3172	1	a	it is gta but free very fun with friends
3174	1	a	10/10 would reload apb again
3176	1	a	its ok
3178	1	a	First impression of the game was great. However, as I progressed, and looked around, did research... I discovered that the game is indeed pay to win, with an over priced cash shop to boot.  That aside, Strong weapons don't give you skill. You can outplay a cash weapon, but God help you if you have an aimbotter with one. Yes, this game is full of hackers. Hell, today I was up against someone named 'NxT' Who has horrible, horrible aim just two days ago. Now suddenly, they have near perfect aim, no matter where you go, where you juke, where you jump, it hits. This isn't a rare case, a lot of people hack, and the community denies it, along with denying claims of pay to win. Side note, yesterday I saw someone running on foot, faster than any car in the game. Aimbot: Check. Speed hacks: Check.  NOW. If you can put those aside, it's actually an extremely fun game, it's fun to jsut ♥♥♥♥ around, make decals to sell, cruise around and 'accidentally' hit someone that's clearly in a mission, ruining what he's doing. If you're the type to be able to find fun as a free player that can enjoy his time, working around hackers and going on a grind for other weapons, then I will recommend this game.  If you're the type to really care about a fair fight (We'll get to Fair Fight after this bit) then I cannot recommend this game. You will find a lot of hackers and cashers that think they're super cool to have stats that you can only get by paying $40 bucks for one weapon.  Onto Fair Fight, APB's pride and joy of an anti cheat system. Yeah, it's complete trash. They have an over priced cash shop, and don't spring for real anti cheating. I'm being completely honest when I say that 1 out of 10 hackers are banned, and the one ban is still very rare.  TLDR? Recommended if you're not a tryhard.  I myself enjoy the game, being a free player that plans to not spend a dime on the game, so this review ends in recommended simply due to my own enjoyment.
3180	1	a	Ok, very nice, but when i spend 1000$ for ammo, i can't use it!
3182	1	a	10/10 would reload apb again
3184	1	a	only if there was a medieval game like this
3186	1	a	this best game ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3188	1	a	cool this is awesome like GTA but free :)
3190	1	a	This game is an awesome game. The Disadvantages are that its 49% Pay To Win game, you have to pay to play. The advantages are is that the gameplay, graphics are smooth, just a tiny abit laggy, but not alot. I would rate 8/10
3192	1	a	That game is Cool YOLOOOO!!
3194	1	a	still better than uriel's chasm
3196	1	a	the second gta v online very nice game i recommend:)

3204	1	a	Fun game, although you can get pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ sometimes.
3206	1	a	Aids, cancer &amp; ebola pretty much sums up the community of this game.
3208	1	a	Crashed car into jewlery shop infront of afk cop and stole all the stuff...  I made a cool shirt some really creepy kid asked me how i showed him ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) we did mission He exploded mi car we won  10/10 would be stalked again
3210	1	a	This is actually a good looking game though Vehicle controls is a hassle. Game is like an MMO version of Saints Row: The Third
3212	1	a	3.9/5

3216	1	a	i love the cops in this game and in real life

3222	1	a	prety fukkn dope guise 4 seris i wsnt payd by dev
3224	1	a	Too many fattys -1/0
3226	1	a	Fun PvP game, glorified Cops and Robbers. Unlock contacts to get better guns, vehicles and customizations for your character. It's not always fair, higher threat levels are able to come into lower level servers and kill off noobs, but that puts the challenege to it, doesn't it?
3228	1	a	prety fukkn dope guise 4 seris i wsnt payd by dev
3230	1	a	APB, a game where gravity is made up, and a garbage truck can do a triple backflip
3232	1	a	Fun to mess around.
3234	1	a	Arrested someone for holding a TV. 10/10
3236	1	a	After GTA Online but on your PC? APB is kind of like that, lots of multiplayer mayhem and lots of fun too.  The main downside being 'free to play' you have to pay to unlock decent guns which also have a time limit measured in days. Also, from time to time you do run into hackers and the matchmaking system is really poor at evenly matching people up with the same skill levels (sometimes frustratingly bad). That said, it’s easy to tell who's hacking and who the actual good players are and there are lots btw. The game does get repetitve after a while, I find its best in few hour sessions when I don't feel like playing my main game.  Money is reasonably easy come by, you can ram-raid shops as a crim or just do the pvp missioning system which forms the core gameplay. If you get bored of that you can always grab a dump truck and go have fun grefing up people’s missions, although that sounds bad there are very strict mechanics in play that prevent constant greifing most of the time.   APB is a lot of fun if you are prepared to spend a few dollars for a couple of guns (the NTEC scoped is my fav) and has given me and my friends many hours of entertainment compared to the cost. Try it out, hang in there longer then the first 15 minutes or so and let it sink in and you will be rewarded with a fun casual game in your library.
3238	1	a	Pretty Fun MMO. Reminds me of Saint's Row.
3240	1	a	I like this game. Alot.

The game does get repetitve after a while, I find its best in few hour sessions when I don't feel like playing my main game.  Money is reasonably easy come by, you can ram-raid shops as a crim or just do the pvp missioning system which forms the core gameplay. If you get bored of that you can always grab a dump truck and go have fun grefing up people’s missions, although that sounds bad there are very strict mechanics in play that prevent constant greifing most of the time.   APB is a lot of fun if you are prepared to spend a few dollars for a couple of guns (the NTEC scoped is my fav) and has given me and my friends many hours of entertainment compared to the cost. Try it out, hang in there longer then the first 15 minutes or so and let it sink in and you will be rewarded with a fun casual game in your library.
3244	1	a	Hard to start and ♥♥♥♥ING more updates longgggggg to updates too But rlly cool game XD
3246	1	a	After 277 hours I can confidently say: 'Meh, it's okay'
3248	1	a	Great game, open world, fun to play. Only two bad things, the hackers and the pay to wins.
3250	1	a	its good game
3252	1	a	*Sighs* What can I say.. APB is really fun.  Making and having friends is worth grouping up the whole time. Playing alone sucks (Truly does) Hackers are real in this game (No jokes) Trolling players can be awesome, but can do harm. (Yes... Camuga... you heard me! My Serbian friend :3)  Still loving APB. Could say its a drug.. that never leaves you.
3254	1	a	Amazing game  + Graphics + Multiplayer + womans  + cars
3256	1	a	First of all this game is one of the best games I have ever played, although there are some down times, but most of the time it's all good if u spend it on the right people. Secondly, this game is not pay 2 win, I've played apb for more than 1000+ hours and didn't event spent a single cent on this game and I still beat most players that spend tons of cash in this game. Lastly the only way to be good at this game is to practice, sounds weird but yeah, no amount of money can make u a professional cause it all rests on ur skills. To sum up this game is good but needs minor improvement and also fulfillment of promises should be kept regarding a certain engine update
3258	1	a	aye govna you can run roun with the rest of the lads and mug chaps of their teapots id give this game a ten?british prime minister... Love Ya Lots Brit skinhead
3260	1	a	The game is quite nice, has an awesome designer and a cool gameplay. It will gives you a good laugh but also show up your baddiest attitute, depends on your daily mood anyways. I like its potencial but dislike some decisions G1 has thrown into the game.  Still well worthed giving it a shot  /regards ToMmY
3262	1	a	it was okay, a little messy and crusty here and there. Kinda like my bed sheets. 6/10
3264	1	a	Hard to start off but nice in the end

3272	1	a	admin what ban me??? pliz unlock ban [+5 stars]
3274	1	a	This game is really fun! Most people dislike this because of the graphics! If you go into the settings you can change it. Remember this game is free! I recommend this game
3276	1	a	  It's a really cool game where you can be a cop or criminal. Its really dun with its event and you can. CustomizE your char. Heck! You can even paint your clothes! Customize your char to look like a naked person or deadpool.  You can customize your car and make music too!  'But!'  It's a pay to win

3294	1	a	admin what ban me??? pliz unlock ban [+5 stars]
3296	1	a	Here's the bottom line. The game is fun, but very difficult to learn, which is why the community is considered garbage because new players leave before they ever get a chance to really play.   There is a one second delay for driving. No matter how fast your download and upload speed is, you can not, you will not, be able to play without lag. Game was released for Xbox One not too long ago and it's a million and one times better driving than it is on PC. There are so many people that actually pay for premium weapons that it makes people, like myself, who don't have weapons that require irl currency, to be shut down.   If you have an Xbox One, go and play it there. You will BARELY run into ANYONE that has premium ♥♥♥♥ because the game just came out. Have fun. Stick with it and grind off of missions. :)
3298	1	a	§
3300	1	a	To Say This Is Much Better Than GTA. But APB Reloaded Has No Story Lines To Say :(
3302	1	a	this game is recommanded for those who like free-roam games and don't really care about storylines. So.. this game had been released quite some time already, but there's like NO improvements at all, nothing new no new maps or missions. It's also pay to win. But it not all bad, it's fun if you just like going free-roam games i guess.
3304	1	a	This game is super cool. The unique feel of the game makes it a very diverse expeirience. I would deffinently reccomend trying it out!
3306	1	a	1.buy a car   2.get yelled at by a 12 year old  3.kill him  4.turns out hes the owner of the game  5.get banned     11/10 would get banned again 
3308	1	a	yes great game has gun driving i love it cool im not rlly hard and it fun trying rob but rlly havent tried a cop but i love crimal it a good it kinda like saint row and gta blend in with other shooter games
3310	1	a	Slowly grinding my way up to supreme ♥♥♥♥ bag, today I was able to kill 2 people and get 1 assist.  10/10 would die for my pride again.
3312	1	a	its nice game! but sometimes i have lags and droping fps. if you can fix plz.
3314	1	a	This game is so wonderful. Ive spent over 300 hours playing and i plan to continue to play for many many many more hours. The cheaters in the game? its nowhere near as bad as people make it out to be. I only encounter 1 cheater every 60-100 mathces. Even then, they aren't ridiculously blanant and only have some sort of aim assistance, but you can still beat them if you are any good at the game. The game doesn't run the best, but they are working on a new engine and really want to have it up soon. If we got more people to come into all of these servers and get a little more revenue going towards the developers, we might actually see big improvements in this game. It has the potential to be an awe inspiring game that we play for years to come. I seriously recommend trying this game, the learning curve can be a little steep at first, but its nothing you cant get over. The community isn't always bad either, quite a few people are willing to help if you simply ask. Over all, one of my favorite all time games, i seriously recommend it
3316	1	a	You can create you own character and car and its awesome  Me: YEAH, HAVE MY OWN WAIFU AND I CAN GET MY CAR ♥♥♥♥♥
3318	1	a	I happened to go AFK for a second and accidentally parked a big truck on a particularly popular mission objective. When I got back, there were about 20 people trying to get the the marker I was parked on, and about twenty more shooting at them. But because I wasn't in the mission, there was nothing they could do about it.
3320	1	a	Well, I've finally created my character. Time to play!
3322	1	a	-_-
3324	1	a	Has anyone seen my haramabe? 
3326	1	a	Laggy buggy, and AMD not supported :S
3328	1	a	10/10 for me. APB Reloaded is very fun. The driving is a bit bad, but you're able to do good drifts. The shooting is very cool, and fun. The missions are fun. It's fun just to drive around and mess around. You should get this free-to-play game!
3330	1	a	7/10  Pretty good game, a lot of potential. Balancing between new players and 'veterans' isn't great though. Constantly find yourself going against seasoned players in a low tier zone. Makes the game unenjoyable/dull.  Would probably recommend it to a friend, if they're a die hard gamer with that pay to win mentality.  ------------------------  Upon playing further, I've noticed a few things responsible for the sheer lack of balance. Guns are either bought, or unlocked via rank meaning higher ranks have a massive advantage. Too often, you see people on bronze servers with things like Rocket Launchers, Grenade Launchers and extremely strong weapons.  A way to balance the game (without restricting it's population a choice) would be to allow weapons depending on the server. I.e, bronze server, bronze rank weapons; silver, silver, etc etc.  ------- For this to still work towards the paid for weapons (G1), my thoughts would be:   To give a warning 'This weapon can only be used in -bronze;silver;gold- server or above' before purchase, maybe a brief explaination of the servers after for complete clarification.  This will give players a 'want' to get a weapon early, but still have a reason to buy those nifty grenade/rocket launchers later in the game. Result: $$$  This will also keep balance in the servers, giving new players a chance to adapt / try out the gun roles. -------  After attempting to get others onto this game, the main reason most have said no is due to the imbalance in-game. You start the game and immediately get paired against players with these awesome weapons, while you're sat there with a star. Cars can be a bit of an issue in this also, but restricting them doesn't seem viable.  This game still has a while to go before it should've been released to be honest. A lot of hackers, a lot of imbalance and a small population as a result. Hopefully it'll pick up with improvements! But without, the game's fate has already closed.   Another suggestion would be different language chats (main two spoken are English and Russian, so maybe individual channels depending on the IP location recieved? Who knows. Not really important, but an improvement nonetheless.
3332	1	a	I once fell in love with a girl.  People told me to avoid her, she had issues, she was known to cheat on those who loved her, she would make people give her money for insignificant reasons, she would make promises that she would never keep or just clearly take her time in ever doing.   She was the girl for me even with all her flaws. My heart always seemed to have a high ping when I was around her, I would loose packets of my mind randomly, it was like time lagged when we would walk.   I never knew such beauty even with her outdated looks could cause me so much harm. Even when I spent money and dressed her up nicely, I found myself questioning the legitimacy of the friends she kept around in the closet or the one who triggered awkwardly or blatantly so when I got near.   Ah but it was Love or Lust or Stupidity...  Definitely stupidity...  I was a fool, I'm a glutton for punishment. My heart has been crushed by this evil girl everyone warned me about.  That's enough of my Love Life, Back to my Review on APB Reloaded:  This game is very much like my Love Life, I spent money on them, they lie, they cheat, they steal, they never update their looks.   If you like being abused as much as I do! This game is for you. 10/10 would look for love in all the wrong places.
3334	1	a	Now this is a real video game.
3336	1	a	This is a buggy, laggy super frustrating game, but when it works, WHEN it works, it is an amazing thing.. Theirs really nothing out there quite like APB so to me it will always be one of my favorite games, the level of customizations in this game is astounding and even overwhelming at times, and thats just another reason to love it! Download/play this game, its free so why not? *8/10 P.S. New graphics engine coming soon, which is suppouse to fix the lag issues, *fingers crossed.
3338	1	a	THIS IS THE GREATEST RELOAD OF ALL TIME!
3340	1	a	It's like minecraft with mods :)
3342	1	a	An enjoyable game with some glaring flaws, play it with some friends and you will have a blast.  Pros:  * Customisation out the wazoo, can customise cars, characters, etc  * Core gameplay is quite fun, doesn't get boring too quickly  * Killing crims 24/7   Cons:  * Balance issues, some guns are flat out P2W  * Some network lag makes driving difficult  * Slow to update lmoa   An enjoyable game, hardly anything amazing, but enjoyable but for the love of GOD play it with friends
3344	1	a	this game is very cool, i am 9 years old so i can not play grand theft autoban so i can play this game nstead, my mom thinks it is spongebob so she doesnt care. this game has gotten me 16 girlfriends because my car looked very cool, i also wanted to say to people wanting to buy this game that it is very cool and it is like grand theft apple, thanks, pizza hut.
3346	1	a	Love the game! Just wish there was less cheaters.
3348	1	a	Gameplay is so-so, not bad, not the best. However! The Level of customazation is immense! Character, symbol, and cars can be changed to look EXsactly as you like.
3350	1	a	would re play
3352	1	a	This game is pretty cool. lots of fun and action
3354	1	a	classy p2w
3356	1	a	its great:D hard to grasp at first though
3358	1	a	it deos take a long time to download but after you have tryed clicking play and all the other bits and bobs of clicking then it might work or it might not but saying all of this i would recommend this game because when you get the game starter the graphics are nt bad but the only things that dissapoint me is that it takes a while to start when you first get it and the game is quiet confusing for example how to change your outfit or how to upgrade on certain stuff like a gun or a car it is quiet hard but you do get a tutorial and when you drive car it is quiet glichy that might just be me im not sure but over all i would recommend this game  soz for quiet alot of negitive comments apb reloaded but i have to write a review on what i think
3360	1	a	This game is basically Saints Row 3-4 and GTA Online having a baby then shipping it to the 'Free-to-play' section.
3362	1	a	i watch some videos about this and i thought it was really good but i will have to play it first
3364	1	a	hmm i love it 10/10 baby i love the gun skin
3366	1	a	♥♥♥♥ game is ♥♥♥♥. It's pay to win, say no more
3368	1	a	A very nice fast action shooter with a hell of a character customasation!
3370	1	a	This game is awesome.
3372	1	a	Great game lots of Guns and Cars
3374	1	a	Best game for me. Amazing weapons, beautiful cars which player can customize, awesome game system.
3376	1	a	Get this, its free! Pledge yourself to a contact to level up with that person and get the rewards for leveling up, get better weapons to dominate the playing field. Raise your notoriety until your so strong that everyone on the server tries to hunt you down! Customizable weapons come with higher levels and even make your own car the way you like. No two characters look the same, put any clothes on that fit you. Highly recommended.
3378	1	a	GTA + More Customization = APB
3380	1	a	11/10 golds farming bronzies
3382	1	a	Free to Play and amazing, its a win win.
3384	1	a	awesome game, hard to play, hard to master, so if you want a challenge play this
3386	1	a	Awesome, high quality &amp; freedom. Those 3 titles speak for themselves.
3388	1	a	Game similar to GTA but with an MMO twist on it and random cop vs robbers events at all times :D
3390	1	a	APB is just a massive cluste♥♥♥♥ full of hackers and trolls, but, it's still a ton of fun and it's a pretty long and massive adventure, it's free, so trying won't hurt nor cost you anything.
3392	1	a	Its a great action filled MMORPG. You can customize nearly everything in your Playermodel and your vehicles, as well as your loadout and weapons. Big fun with some friends. You'll love to run over the enemies with your cars or blow sh*t up, or just simply hunt the opposition down with all the gunpower you can get. Best thing: Its totally free ! Absolutely worth the try !
3394	1	a	An exemple for character customization. The game itself lacks content and cannot be decently balance because of the huge difference between casual players and harcore fps/tps players, but as a free to play game, you might find a lot of fun if you dare.
3396	1	a	Good game very good
3398	1	a	I like this game nothing like causing trouble.
3400	1	a	It's a great and fantastic game for all!!
3402	1	a	This game is one of a kind.... But it runs out of fun after you get some good stuff 
3404	1	a	it is a really good game to play if you like GTA
3406	1	a	is a cool game it looks like SR3
3408	1	a	Love the character customization, its not hard to get good items (nor does it take much time), but the only con is the darn matchmaking (I have never been matched with people my skill level). But, over all this game is not to bad, it's especially fun with friends.
3410	1	a	its fun. is what i would of said if it let me play
3412	1	a	Great... Can't Say Anything Else... Great
3414	1	a	Probably one of the best 'GTA clones'out there.
3416	1	a	Well I guess this is my love/hate game. No matter how hard i rage,i still come back,for various reasons. Such as: 1.Customization 2.Competitive Gameplay ( after you play long enough to actually know how this thing works) 3.Brains&gt;Guns 4.F2P  Bad Things: 1.YOU WILL RAGE SO DARN MUCH.
3418	1	a	we steal cars and money and run from the cops and we play it on steam
3420	1	a	The game is nice but there is the problem with hacking and cheating like hell....but maybe with the new ati-hack system it will be better. HF&amp;GL
3422	1	a	This game is awesome, It is a open world type like 'GTA'. It is a fun, Funny, Awesome game. You can costumize stuff, As in Clothing, Cars, Charcter and more. There is shooting, killing, and there is missions and a bunch of fun. You could race if you wanted. You can break windows on stores and steal stuff for money, You can play 'GTA' Style. You can run over peoplessss,and kill them, terroize peeps, troll and just do what ever chu want. :D (Ik if you dislike this cause I went to much in the game kinda but this is like whats in the game and what you expect.) Hope dis was helpfully for new players, And for other players who dont know what to do :P
3424	1	a	i HAVENT PLAYED THIS GAME ALOT BUT IT A PRETTY DECENT GAME BUT ITS KINDA PAY TO WIN
3426	1	a	mister shmoo played it so i have to
3428	1	a	i havent played it yet but i perdict that its gunna be a good game=Comment Made Through A Windows 8
3430	1	a	really good game!
3432	1	a	I really want to like this game, but it's hard to at times.  If you can run it, it's worth a try.
3434	1	a	Overall a fun game to screw around in with friends, but has quite a few flaws.  PROS:  -Like I said, fun to screw around in -GTA-Style freeroam -Free (although quite a few microtransactions) -Customization  CONS: -Servers get very very VERY laggy -A lot of microtransactions -Performance issues during gunfights (an issue with many people) -Expensive microtransactions  
3436	1	a	About 4000 hours spent and ruined my life, Five stars.
3438	1	a	Well YES and NO. IT TAKES SO LONG TO UPDATE EVERYTIME AND I BOUGHT THE GAME LIKE 2 WEEKS AGO AND STILL HAVENT BEEN ABLE TO PLAY IT
3440	1	a	The worst game EVER in the history, worst gamplay, worst community, worst everything. Don´t download it.
3442	1	a	+ Good combat + Nice driving system  + A lot of customisation - You can only buy weapons for max. 10 days with the money you get in game - Almost everything is expensive so you have to spend money on it for full fun - Takes ages to get into a game sometimes
3444	1	a	It's okay, gets repetitive after a few hours. Customization possibilities are amazing, though! &lt;3
3446	1	a	Despite APB's insane customisation options it's hampered by a too small a gameworld to play around in and repetitive missions. Hopefully future updates will rectify these issues, but until then this game is just 'OK'.
3448	1	a	If you like GTA-style games where you roam around a city and do random stuff? If so, you will enjoy this because it has customization system unimaginably briliant. When you start off, you create your own character. There are so many little things you can change with your character's face. You can also customize your car, as well as buying new cars. Once again, the customization is huge, probably the most of a single game. This game is a cops-and-robbers style game and I have to say, it is pretty fun. Also, you won't need such of a beefy computer to play APB Reloaded, just have a dedicated graphics card, and you'll be fine.
3450	1	a	Old Review : Great game to play with friends, trades money for socks.
3452	1	a	One of the best F2P MMO RPG games out there, download it and try it yourself.
3454	1	a	good game use some work with the tiny details but thats being picky but all round a great game for people who likw open world shooter
3456	1	a	Truly a good game worth trying.  Pros: Customization on almost everything, Clothes, Cars, Your Personal Avatar Cons: It is somewhat pay to win, premium gives advantage over poorer players.
3458	1	a	Bears similiarities to Saints Row and GTA, steep learning curve but alot of fun. This game has been going strong for a while now and though progress is slow it is being update constantly, a whole new area has been added as well as multiple items which can be had at not actual cost. This game is the very formula for a proper F2P, there is no pay to win and should you chose to purchase a weapon or vehicle be certain you shop wisely since each is well suited to a particular playstyle.
3460	1	a	A really fun game, have played since the original from Real Time Worlds was released. I would recommend to have a great computer with the minimum of 4 GB of RAM to play this. Apart from this, the sandbox environment of cops and criminals makes anybody happy. Just word of advice, don't play this game if you are easy to become angry.
3462	1	a	This game is pretty badass. The amount of customization you can do with everything, including characters, cars, clothes, and weapons is insane.
3464	1	a	Is laggy tho.
3466	1	a	it is a good gameto get you hype
3468	1	a	this is a pretty good game its pretty much gta 4 free its really fun  ur eaver poilice or gangsters 
3470	1	a	Its Fun Epic And Free!
3472	1	a	its a pay to win game but play if you want to
3474	1	a	This game is decent if you are willing to look past the bugs and rage inducing Pay 2 win weapons. I do suggest that you play with a group of friends and use VoIP, seeing as how its damn near impossible to win any missions without communication. This game is also pretty poorly optimized, loading the freckles of the pedestrians faces before loading the wall that you are about to unwittlingy drive into, so I urge you to only play this if you have a damn good machine and no anger problems.
3476	1	a	I keep it short, awesome Game &lt;3
3478	1	a	Drew a big ♥♥♥♥♥ on my big pink van.  Painted a big pink ♥♥♥♥ on my jacket. Drew a big pink ♥♥♥♥♥ on my guns.  ♥♥♥♥♥/10
3480	1	a	A quite fun game, Full customization of characters and vehicles, It's learning curve can be a bit steep and It has a few unbalances but It's still enjoyable nevertheless, I'd say It's ideal to play with a friend and work together.
3482	1	a	This game is Dank Simulator 2011 Bush did 9/11 edition. For real,it's an okay game,with friends or a bigger clan it's outright great. Lots and by that i mean ♥♥♥♥tons of costumization(some minor things like fedoras,yes you can buy fedoras for real money) cost real cash. Contrary to what people say the game is not pay2win,as if you're good enough you can beat anything with the default gun. The STAR is a star,amirite? See you in the city.
3484	1	a	Great game. You can find a lot of good people!
3486	1	a	For being a free game, this is just the right amount of entertaining.
3488	1	a	This is a good game. It can get boring from time to time, however it is similar to Grand Theft Auto maybe a little more bland however it is a good game I would recommend to people 8/10
3490	1	a	nice game but lag!
3492	1	a	very underestimated, its really good i like the creativity involed in the game and you should definatly download this. people say this game has hackers and bad performance, i have encountered no hackers and have smooth fps, but what do you expect its a huge game its not going to run 60fps with no problem.  11/10 - ITS FREE!
3494	1	a	It's from one of the designers of Grand Theft Auto. So think of it like that. But better, because this is not a serious game in any way. It's all about fun, and it is. I love the customization-- crazy stuff!
3496	1	a	Pack a whole bunch of friends in a smash into each other!
3498	1	a	This game is very fun and there is so much to do! Rob people.. break in to stuff.. play missions! Kill cops..  The customisation is CRAZY Huge.. You can make your own symbols and put them on cars and clothes! You can literally make any character!  The cars are so cool to ride with and jumping with them is even cooler! So many guns and cars!   +1 Awesome game!
3500	1	a	Pros 1. Unlimited customization of characters.  2. Skirmishes chases and stuff. (GTA fans hello)  3. The dynamic loading of the location.  Cons 1. Demanding on hardware .  2. Quickly stale mission.  3. In-game store . (One side well , the other bad)
3502	1	a	If you like gta then you will like this game! It has very cool weapons and just be carefull.
3504	1	a	Totally recommended ^^
3506	1	a	Great game! So much fun being to customize so much! GAMEPLAY IS AMAZING!!!!!
3508	1	a	If you want an in-depth review that isn't extremely lengthy but covers what you'll probably want to know, continue reading.  Let me start off by saying that I played this game when it's Beta released from it's original developers, Real Time Worlds. They went under and the game shut down. GamersFirst picked the game up and transformed it into a Free 2 Play game. I couldn't be more happy to see it return as I enjoyed the game very much during its initial release and having it now be a F2P game could make it even better.  This happened in some ways, and some not so much. The gameplay definitely won't appeal to everyone, but with it being a F2P game, may as well try it out, right? Before you do, maybe this review will help you decide.  First off, the game's customization is awesome. I haven't seen any other game like it. There's a symbol creator that you can, if you have a wide enough imagination, literally create anything you want with the provided shapes, pre-made graphics, letters, etc. You can warp the decals, rezise, color, fade and rotate them to your liking. When you're satisfied with your symbol, you can save it and place it on your character's clothing, on your character's skin as a tattoo, or on your vehicle. This, on top of the character customization (much like the SIMS, with height, weight, facial features customizer) really allows you to be what ever kind of character you want in the game. Like any Free 2 Play game, you'll have to pay to unlock higher tier items or more symbol layer slots to create more advanced graphics for your character. A free account is not limited enough to make it not worth while; give it a try!  Moving on to the initial startup experience. You'll be promted with a login screen when you load up the game. You'll need to sign in through your GamersFirst account or log in through Steam. Once you're in, you'll get to the character selection window and select your character. You'll then be prompted with a district selection window. Clicking one of the large tiles will auto select a district for you. This typically isn't the best solution to use once you are used to the game. I suggest going to the District selection tab for a more advanced search of where to play. Most instances are limited to 90 or 100 players. This is a pretty decent amount of players per instance in my opinion. When you've found an instance to connect to, you'll be sent in and spawn shortly in the map.  Moving on to the gameplay. Most people will argue that the gameplay is horribly unbalanced and that it's a heavily Pay 2 Win (P2W) game. While some areas are unbalanced, it's not completely unplayable otherwise there wouldn't be anyone playing it. As for P2W, this is not the case. There is a marketplace called ARMAS. You buy permanent weapons from this marketplace for real money. These weapons can be created using in-game cash earned from missions and bought through contacts. Each weapon can have up to 3 modifications put into it to advance it's abilities. If anything, the paid weapons from ARMAS just create less of a hassle, saves time and allow newbie players to get on a level somewhat even with the more advanced players. The gameplay is definitely different than most games. As I'm sure you've seen by now, it's a third-person shooter, which has its ups and downs. You can wall peak without having the enemy know, so if they're coming around a corner at you, you have the full upper hand on them, unless they decide to run back and forth and you miss every shot and they happen to kill you first (which happens a lot). Overall, the gameplay is decent and I've enjoyed it over the years I've played this game.  Overall, I recommend that you at least try this game. Don't give up straight away because you can't kill anyone, that's going to happen if you're a newbie player. Try grouping up with some higher level players or get a few friends to join in and work as a team. Use voice communication and work together to defeat the opposition. This game relies heavily on great teamwork.
3510	1	a	Fun to ♥♥♥♥ around in and make your character a true BFF. As in cronically deformed big ♥♥♥♥ing freak. Otherwise there is no depth. But the first element is so amazing I must give this game a positive score.
3512	1	a	It's ok I guess? It's like a knock off GTA IV kinda.
3514	1	a	it's a really good multiplayer game that my friend introduced me to. its a free rome and really cool. In my opinion it's like gta but better.
3516	1	a	Very fun Online game The whole game is a 'Cops Vs Robbers' type of deal with tons of random events going off  APB Reloaded plays like a Grand-Theft Auto Multiplayer title. Players form groups and engage in missions against the opposing side. As players complete missions and kill opposing players they will gain ranks in their weapon of choice and standing with NPC's and earn cash to buy new weapons, clothing and cars.  The best part I like about this game is the free customizations you can do such as edit your players clothing and vehicle, make anything you want yourself/vehicle to look like..  (check out my screenshots on my steam page to see examples of my vehicles)  Chose your side at the start; Criminal or Enforcer, the choice is yours!  Cons:  Some weapons are Pay-To-Win but it does not stop you all the time.
3518	1	a	At first I thought my graphics were just turned down but it was just the game. 11/10 gg
3520	1	a	it will play
3522	1	a	Gud gaem. I likes to shut the bad giys wiht my gun and go bam bam bam? 
3524	1	a	This game is overall really fun because it gives you the feeling of GTA but its not actually as dirty as GTA... I like how you can choose Cops or Criminals and you still get the same edit features.... Overall great.
3526	1	a	Very cool game and epic action !
3528	1	a	crashed into a car everything exploded except me 11/10
3530	1	a	Ok, i only have 200 hours of game i think, ihave a cop rank 162 but i have team and lot play with 255 max rank, first thing STOP SAY ITS THE BEST PAY TO WIN EVER guys, its a FREE game how do you think the money come for free games ? they need this money for make updates and bring some new contains, i just love this game because the gameplay is unique, the free world isnt big but its free you can do what you want but the coolest part of this game is the editor, your character is unique, that the only game i never seen 2 peoples with same outfit, but yes there is some negative points, the matchmaking is very very bad , the poor bronze or silver 30 come against premade hackers team, and on ther team there is some max rank too, so what they do ? they kick them but actually you need demerit to kick, but last time i see a man who kill the recruit who was on our team, the recruit revenge by kill him, and he got kick, thats disgusting, anything the community is too bad, after a game or on district chat they say you like ' gg ez ' for example, i just hate that and some kids who take a green planet truck and blow up your car, that dumb, that show how immature they are, and unfair players , ohter negative point the hitbox wherever you shot that same thing, and same for the cars, the nhvr some hackers will never miss you 100% i swear you you can easy see who is a nvhr hacker and who is not and if they dont hack and if they dont have skills they will quickswitch, maybe people like this but for me this not show skills, this is my mind, hope this note was helpful have fun guys maybe see you ingame bye.
3532	1	a	On Colby server a user name RUS1946 the hack she was using HakbyHak i saw RUS1946 flicker threw walls
3534	1	a	Good game! Early on can be P2W BUT all the end game guns are far better than cash shop guns!
3536	1	a	This is what seems to be a horribly dumbed down version of Grand Theft Auto. The only 'quests' you receive come in the form of Missions, an event triggered that effects six to twenty people, balanced between Criminals and Enforcers.  Even though it is a cheap knockoff of GTA and you have to put in money to be halfway competetive... it's still fun as hell once you get the hang of it. Also, the amount of customizations are rediculous! You have to play for a crazy amount of time to unlock the customizations you want... but, it's worth it.  Overall summary - it's free to play and it's fun... until you realize that those who put money into it pwn your ♥♥♥ over and over.  *disclaimer* I'm spend a grand total of $0.00 in this game.
3538	1	a	It takes a while to get use to but the online is smooth. Im a new player and its ok from the start 8/10.
3540	1	a	cool multiplayer game for a tactical team based 3rd Person shooter and a Mix of Grand Theft Auto and Counter Strike/Team Fortress with RPG elements. Awesome community and support, working on new events and game development =) still fighting with bugs abuse and balance issues though... Biggest PLUS enormous ability of customisation, from appearance of you (tattoos, face, hair etc.) clothings, cars but also killtheme , character mods, spcials, weapon and car upgrades, and even more
3542	1	a	I really loved the game when i did play it for quite a while but the thing is i hate that some of the really good items you have to buy with money pretty much. Its still a good game though while it lasts.
3544	1	a	I Really Enjoy This Game Because I Don't Have To Pay For GTA
3546	1	a	this game is unbalanced. but its great.   arrest people, everyone hates you for it but its the best.
3548	1	a	Really good and fair game. Without G1C you can do fine(Still be one of top).Report system work. G1C system is good as well because developers need and deserve money(So if you want to be fancy-donate). You can get almost anything for free with game money. Only problem are botters&amp;afk ppl.... they are all over FC:BS and silver districs.
3550	1	a	Play this ♥♥♥♥ing game its AWSOME! 
3552	1	a	I recommend this with the stipulation that your computer is better than average. This is a performance-intensive game, but it is worth it. The city of San Paro is beautiful, and the customization options you have for your characters and vehicles are remarkable. When a massive traffic jam causes problems, it can make for engaging gameplay - or it can bog down a subpar RAM setup.  It's a freemium game that under-delivered on the promises made by the original APB. While it is not a perfect game by any stretch, the interactions and gunfight scenarios available to you in the given setting are fantastic. This was GTA Online before there was a GTA Online. It's worth trying, at the very least.
3554	1	a	Great game. Loads of fun. It's like GTA but online. The amount of customization beats any game I've ever seen. Sadly, gameplay 100% competetive and ate up with cheaters. Aside from that, you will have tons of fun just hanging out with friends and designing your character, cars, clothes, tattoos, graffiti, and even music.
3556	1	a	i play for 5 minutes and the game crashes ?? pls help 
3558	1	a	Seems like a good game. I kinda hate the driving. It feels like you're driving on ice or oil.
3560	1	a	From cars doing 20 kickflicks and landing perfectly, to smashing into other peoples cars with dump trucks against buildings and blowing them up, Apb is a truly good racing game.   Why drive a F1 car or a nascar when you can ride a car in APB, hit the turbo and go flying off a ramp only to land on top of a pack of roaming civilians in the parellel city to San Fransico called san paro?   The development cost for the game was 100 million dollars. But the moments that occur while in your car are truly priceless.   Feeling lucky? back up into a cuve in your jeep and get blown up. Dont worry, it only happens under certain ideal conditions.  
3562	1	a	10/10 would waste 100$ again 
3564	1	a	Wanna dem there rage first, ♥♥♥♥in play later games. Ya just come beck to it.
3566	1	a	love this game :)
3568	1	a	This game...Too damn good; been playing only a week and cannot seem to stop. The community is mostly good, and the gameplay smooth and well put together. This is one of my only reviews on steam and for good reason, I don't consider myself fair enough to not be overcritical, download this game, its truly free with premium mostly involving looks and vehicles.
3570	1	a	A slight GTA copy but it is very fun and it's free! Yay! You can play as the police or the criminals, but the game can be full of trolls at times, but it's imaginitve and very entertaining.
3572	1	a	WARNING! THIS GAME IS TOTAL GARBAGE, DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS PEICE OF TRASH!!!!!
3574	1	a	YES I DO GET THIS GAME OR KILL YOURSELF.
3576	1	a	I've played it before, and have had horrible experiences with it, such as getting in-game currency is difficult. It shouldn't be easy to get, but not so hard either.To those at 'Gamers First' , give their all into making this the helluva good game this truly is supposed to be.
3578	1	a	I can't recommend this game enough as it is an amazing experience to play with friends effortlessly. I have played this game for a long time and i can't recommend it enough. Give it a try it's free to play, you have nothing to lose and a huge ammount to gain. 8/10= Solo 9.5/10= With friends.
3580	1	a	I recommend!
3582	1	a	good but rage inducing game
3584	1	a	Apb reloaded is an mmorpg set in a distopian society its extremely addicting ive stopped playing 3 times I ended I up crawling back. when you start the game you'll likely get rekt by gold players who shouldn't even be in that server, you'll eventually get better, buy better guns and wreck other people. it also has one of the best character customization iv'e seen in all of gaming. all in all its a great game with a not so very noob friendly community.   8.5/10
3586	1	a	So, here you are. You're debating whether or not to press that sweet, sweet play now button. What could be the harm? I mean, you've heard it has a great customization system. It looks a little like GTA, and since you're too poor (or cheap) to pay for the actual game, you've come to the free version of it.  Well, as all free things come with, this game will have its downsides.  'Good' Things: - Awesome customization - Physics=non-existent - Be half naked and you still have the same amount of health as a kickass SWAT team member - Did I mention walking through the social district is essentially the same as watching porn? - Car customization too.  Bad things. Really, really bad things: - Pay to win. People will deny that it's true, but it is. Some guns can take you down in a simple two hits. Some guns can take out a car in one hit. - The presets for their character creation are TERRIBLE. It looks like you just rose from the grave to kill someone if you choose the female model (like me). - So I heard you liked cars? Well, be prepared to grind endlessly through missions to get the money and 'Joker tickets' to buy them. -Matchmaking is terrible. You may be a bronze rank (ranking being from bronze, to silver, to gold with gold being the highest) and be paired up with a full squad of golds.  - You CAN'T LEAVE A MATCH WITHOUT QUITTING THE ENTIRE GAME. - If you randomly get rocketed to gold rank like I did, when you can't kill people for ♥♥♥♥ and are just playing to customize, guess what? No more going onto lower ranking servers, because obviously everyone who gets gold rank is MLG af. - 10 year olds.  10/9 would play for the rest of my days for clothing.
3588	1	a	Woudn't work on my computer
3590	1	a	Everyone complains about the lagging because their servers honestly arent very good...but overall I am addicted to the gameplay. Its definitely not something you can just jump into and get the hang of. The overall gunplay and mission action is great. The open world makes this game what it is...the awesome stuff you can do XD. Have fun
3592	1	a	fun......................as.......................................hell 
3594	1	a	Great fun free to play cops vs robbers TPS. Battling out with up to 50vs50, can get very intense!
3596	1	a	The best MMO shooter ive ever played! Honestly the game is mostly about customization! If you like amazing games then play this!
3598	1	a	a fun game if you can get past the first days being so unfairly terrible you want to quit, ram people with dumptrucks if you so please to cool off but once you get used to the game and the fighting mechanics it seems to get easier for you. im running a free membership using nothing but a no mod jg and the default pistol and grenades, and im a silver rank 54 the game is amazing although some guns are just horrible to hear them go off in your face, (OSMAW)..
3600	1	a	great game if you don't mind disconnecting every 30 minutes or so on the weekend. do not play this game during summer, or only play around 6-9 AM EST, when all of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ 12 year old brats are asleep. during school season, 4-11 AM EST is a decent time block for playing, since they're all passed out by then. the cash shop ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t is just that: ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. paying for access to the premium shop, and then paying a subscription for your extra special guns really ♥♥♥♥ing sucks and you should never, ever do it. always best to play with a group of people for missions, since good tactics and communication always beat shiny cash-shop ♥♥♥♥. besides being able to have really intricate character customization, i really enjoy getting in my obnoxious van and following people around while playing stupid music. attempting to follow traffic laws is pretty fun, and a difficult challenge.
3602	1	a	Really cool, butt not swuggesting to people that do not have a good computer.
3604	1	a	Amazing game for the price (free),Though i do not reccomend it if you have a bad ping. It becomes very difficult to play with any lag.
3606	1	a	the game is good but the ranking system have to change but it is fun playing as both :) do get down and ply see ya in APB :)
3608	1	a	Amazing game, spent way too long playing it. Had fun everytime though
3610	1	a	I think this is a sort of gta 5 style game thirdperson customise and much more you get missions guns and lots !!  I would rate this 10/10
3612	1	a	Not bad at all.... Kinda boring at beginning, but Nice Game, thats all ; )
3614	1	a	i like this game nice to play you get lost in it 8 out of 10
3616	1	a	When I played the Closed Beta in late 2009, it was a really cool game. But when Realtime Worlds, the makers of the game, went down, Gamersfirst took over the game and made it Free-to-play. It is now a pure pay-to-win game with extreme bonuses that are included in the premium membership etc. It's almost impossible to enjoy the game if you're not a premium user.   But hey, give it a try - it's not a bad game afterall!
3618	1	a	very funny and lot of violence why wouldnt you play it?
3620	1	a	Fun as hell! Just be ready to blow your money on in game purchases, or you'll be stuck with less than average equipment.
3622	1	a	Its a game full of customize juice, you get to put/do things all over your belongings and show the world your creations. Bad or not, this game brings get memorys.
3624	1	a	Pretty fun game. I would recommend playing as a criminal.
3626	1	a	Very enjoyable game. Very fun to play with friends and I think it's really cool that you can design cars and clothing design. I've played this game in 2 years In a row And it was not even boring . the Cool things you can create like cars and clothing and Symbols I really liked the design of the guns And the missions !   10/10
3628	1	a	I liked this game allot, but recent troubles logging in is a pain in the a$$ so i dont reccomend unless you know every single password you have ever had 
3630	1	a	great game love it
3632	1	a	almost better than gta 4
3634	1	a	hI GUYS }:) 
3636	1	a	This game is like gta 4 but online mmo. so you chose Criminal or Enforcer?
3638	1	a	I recommend it because I have see gameplay but I have soo many problems with it.
3640	1	a	its fun to play.gives me a gta vibe.graphics can be improved.has lots of bugs.mechanics need improvement.
3642	1	a	Awesome game, concept's one i'm a fan of.. but if only they had a server in Australia..
3644	1	a	The game just wont work. I downloaded this for gamerfirst then steam....none work. Please tell me how to fix this.
3646	1	a	It's fun, and thats it pretty much, comunity sucks, and unless you have money to buy cool stuff you're pretty under equipped compared to some enemies, I am obviously COP so the criminals P*ss me off all the time if it isnt the random players ramming into your car, it's the lack ot team work.   It has costomization, very good i must say, but, cars are super expensive and there could be more options to pimp out cop cars...  Besides that as a COP it's cool to just 'cruise' around pretending you're patrolling and then getting a call and steaming off with sirens, but then thats it...
3648	1	a	good game but i hav lags all the time how i fix it? 
3650	1	a	This has to be one of the best free2play games that steam has to offer, that's if you have a thing for GTA style games. With the endless customization that involves cars, clothing, music themes, and so on.. this game gives you more possibilities than any other game that has been released.  Pros: Endless amount of customization choices Great Shooting style Easily adaptable for new players  Cons: Not a huge community[Still big enough to enjoy though] Game servers sometimes lag Hackers Griefers [ General multiplayer games have this though]  Driving system seems like it could be better than it is at the moment..  Rating : 8/10   If you're looking for a decent game to play you might as well give this a try and end up becoming addicted, like I have.
3652	1	a	Would pay if it wasn't free to play.
3654	1	a	The game is good but why is it taking its time to load i mean like i have a windows 8 it should run pretty fine...should i just download it from another site or whatever? 
3656	1	a	i agree it isnt the best game it isnt gw2 i know (♥♥♥♥ u gw2 rules)  but: its free fun u can do allot hentai van weed van much custom not so pay to win i killed pay dudes with starter hand gun so f them its skill u no like game? well ♥♥♥♥ YOU its free to play stop hating start playing this game should be loved for its free to play its misions its players and its hentai vans!
3658	1	a	Cool!
3660	1	a	Great and fun game but can make you rage at times. Can customize your toon, cars, clothes, and weapon skins. Can surf on cars and many other stuff. And its free to play!
3662	1	a	Smallest Maps in the History of MMO gaming lol, Still, a funky ♥♥♥ game, glad it got brought back. Had a good fan base :)  Game has WAY too much customization, which in turn made the game extremely small in comparison to other MMO's.  If the maps were bigger, And didnt take 30 seconds to get from one end of town to the other, I'd consider giving this another go, But Beta was as far as I went :|  Maybe one day :P When I'm bored ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.
3664	1	a	Worth a look given the low, low price of free. GTA online before GTA Online and still pretty fun, especially with friends. Character customization like you've never seen, decently fun driving and gunplay that is sufficient. Not a long term game, but drop in every once in a while and wreck some faces.
3666	1	a	meh....its a major P2W but really fun
3668	1	a	i dont get it first you have to buy it and then second you get it for free this does not make sense.
3670	1	a	A Good GTA Clone
3672	1	a	Awesome graphics and realistic driving.
3674	1	a	Sick game.
3676	1	a	I don't exactly know how to put this, but in terms of rating this game. I'd give it a 7/10 only because of the costomization is practically limitless, but on the other hand it's full of hackusators and aimbotters. This game is biggest pile of ♥♥♥♥ I have ever played, BUT.... I keep finding myself playing it again and again only because of the customization... Thats my review of this game try it or don't....
3678	1	a	Very good and addicting game, even though it's a truck load of BS, but hey that's what makes it fun.
3680	1	a	I recommend This The grahpics... are Amazing
3682	1	a	i reccomend this to any one who cant afford or play gta 
3684	1	a	this is a written review
3686	1	a	Great Game,Wonderful Supplement if you don't have enough change to get GTA5.Highly recommend, I have enjoyed many hours capin camping noobs in apb reloaded.
3688	1	a	Imagine GTA where you should buy everything for REAL money.
3690	1	a	reloaded full of crashing bugs and a horrible community. BUT WHY CANT I STOP PLAYING IT
3692	1	a	Free-To-Play, is about the only reason to pick up this game. The community is small, and it's not as polished as it could have been. That being said, it does have it's fun aspects. Everything is a little confusing/overwhelming at first because you're kind of dropped into the world without much of a tutorial, but it's not difficult to work out. Having a friend who plays or would play with you religiously would make it a decent way to spend some time.   Overall I give it a 6/10, it just seems like a dying game that didn't live up to it's potential.
3694	1	a	I used to be a shooter like you till i took an arrow in the knee
3696	1	a	One of the best FTP games on steam, brill experience in the game, love how you can be an enforcer or a criminal, great work.
3698	1	a	at least the uninstall button works
3700	1	a	A very good game...but matchmaking is so bad...
3702	1	a	is rly good
3704	1	a	Yes I recommend this because of the great graphics and how you can customize your character
3706	1	a	7/10
3708	1	a	It's kinda like a free GTA. But with teamwork and a MMORPG style.
3710	1	a	The game I've played the most. Fun Stuff!
3712	1	a	Good game to play with a group of friends! Excitment between the cops and the robbers!
3714	1	a	This is a really great game, but it is a bit pay 2 win ;/
3716	1	a	Play this for customisation and having a laugh.  Don't take it seriously, community members range from awesome to asshat.  The game has a hacker problem, so don't bother trying to be competitive.  3.5 out of 5 panties.
3718	1	a	It has good graphics, good gunplay, great gunplay and some very well designed levels. But some of the levels are sloppy and there is not enough enough mission variet there are also one or 2 glitches but so far the only major glitch is that sometimes the asylum level walls go invisible but overall the game is fun, the guns are fun to use and has good enough replayability. 7.5//10
3720	1	a	A very nice game with beautiful graphics. The sandbox environment gives the player liberty to do almost whatever he wishes. Also the ability to personalise your avatar and your cars is absolutely astonishing. You can make your character look like Ronald McDonald (for example) or whatever goes through your mind. All in all it's a good f2p shooter worth trying. Even though the game is great as gameplay, it's poorly optimised and a horrible stutter accompanies you in-game and just spoils the fun.... especially when trying to get a frag. I could not make it play smoothly on 4gb Ram, an i7 second gen. and a nvidia 540m gpu. Good luck, it really is an awesome game if u can play it without issues.
3722	1	a	I find this game abseloutely entertaining!
3724	1	a	♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ at start and that is where many people quit.Later on the game gets amazing.
3726	1	a	This game is incredible; it's intuitive, successful, and brilliant in my own opinion. The replay value is incredible for a free2play, and if you cruze around in this game with a few friends, it only enhances the experience. Customization is incredible and you can create any and everything. Find the right weapon for you and you are good to go and do some serious damage. Overall i would rate this a 9/10 based on sheer fun with friends, and the constant need to level up and play again.
3728	1	a	Me: 'What's that sound?'  Brian: 'I didn't tell You? This is the Talavan.'  Brian: 'Talavan? Wait, why did you get ou-' BOOM (Assorted laughter) Me: 'F*** You, Brian.'
3730	1	a	Absolutely addicting! A must have game or at least a must try! If you are into the Grand Theft Auto series or the cops and robbers genre? Then, APB Reloaded will keep you busy for hours on end! Lots to do and complete character customization. Leveling up your gun role progression is what makes this game one of a kind!!!! Very unique and original MMO 3rd person shooting game!   aka Badnuz (Colby)
3732	1	a	A good concept with poor execution worth it to check it out just to see what it could have been like.
3734	1	a	This game is awesome until you start playing it...
3736	1	a	The mayhem of a crowded server can be a lot of fun, but the repetitive grind and general lack of anything interesting to do become quickly apparent. But hey, it's free.
3738	1	a	Great game, near limitless possibilities for customization, a lot of potential, skill based shooting system, customized cars, clothes, songs, blasting pokemon random encounter music every time I kill someone... Greatness &lt;3
3740	1	a	APB Reloaded is an action packed MMO. I love it =)
3742	1	a	Great customization, great ideas. Terrible community, terrible way of handling f2p.
3744	1	a	A great mix of GTA style gameplay with an MMO feel. The community does need some improing though.
3746	1	a	I wrote a reccommendation for APB and all I got was this lump of coal.
3748	1	a	Its epic 
3750	1	a	Holy Shitbuckets this game is alot of fun. If you like free roam or Grand Theft Auto give this game a try.
3752	1	a	It's kinda like GTA but less action but hey its a free game
3754	1	a	Although I'm recommending this game, I don't actually play it. The reason is because it's really a pay2win MMO and its gameplay is very repeatative. More then most MMOs. You don't really experience the fullness of this game unless you become a premium member. Without it you have limited customization and weapons are weak. Best weapons are paid for. Though you can get good weapons without using real world currency you still have to save a lot of in-game currency to buy them from other players through a market system. Which is where the premium membership come into play. With it you get a % raise when earning money and xp. I think its a great game.  Only if you have money though.
3756	1	a	yus i rekt all does caps. de be liek O WE GET REKTED BI A 2yer old.
3758	1	a	GamerFirst messed this game up, but still has good gameplay like the orginal APB. 7/10
3760	1	a	Fun game but needs to fix it's major issue with P2W. ((Pay To Win))
3762	1	a	very nice game just like GTA the graphics look kind of like Saint Row The Third 'i think so :D' better get this game
3764	1	a	great game
3766	1	a	Fun game, yet punkbuster kicks you out... gets ♥♥♥♥ing annoying...
3768	1	a	Basicly GTA multiplayer. Teams of Cops vs Robbers duke it out while attempting to complete multi part missions consisting of different win conditions (CTF, Take and Hold, etc.) with 1,000,000 custimization options for characters, vehicles, and weapons. Very pick up and play friendly, great for some quick, fun carnage.
3770	1	a	it's awsome
3772	1	a	Good Game! Be Cop its More Fun...
3774	1	a	its sort of fun
3776	1	a	Grand Theft Auto: Global Offensive If you are that type of person that rages all the time.. dont play this game
3778	1	a	I've played this game for thousands of hours, but i had the luck to start playing during the closed beta, whene everyone sucked.   Now the game's learning curve is much higher because of the experienced players you have to fight as a newbie. A solution would be to go on the forums and find people that want to help you and explain the game to you. Don't worry, there are plenty of people out there willing to help you.  Also ignore the people in the comments saying that the game is p2w, some weapons you pay for do indeed have an advantage, such as the sniper you can run with. But the downside of this sniper is that it only does 55% damage instead of 85% with the regular sniper. So ignore these trolls bashing the game and just try it ^^
3780	1	a	best free game ever you will love it 
3782	1	a	A great game. I've spend a lot of time playing APB:R and I've had fun.  Although, best tip I can give you: Beware this game will eat your money!
3784	1	a	this is a great game but i dont get the point of it plus its FREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
3786	1	a	Excellent game pre-hacks. Good job on the reboot with the pay to win model, simple, effective, and i'm sure much more profitable than the initial launch. Ultimately, hackers ruin the experience the player base is truly tiny.
3788	1	a	Best 3D Multiplayer game  
3790	1	a	ITS FUN NO FREDDY IM DEAD
3792	1	a	So Much to say for this game, but im going to keep it moderately short. When i first started playing this game it was on the Real Time Worlds Beta for All Points Bulletin, I was stunned with the visuals they offered with a gameplay mechanic that is strong anduser friendly, Newbro or Oldhead alike can really get into something like this if you like Third Person,Single-Hitbox Shooters that are fast and PvP focused. The greatest thing about this game hands down is that the customization options dont just stop at your characters facial features and hairstyle. You can literally customize every aspect of your Alter-Ego in APB:Reloaded. Gamersfirst took over and did it right!   From Hair,Skin,Eyes,Facial Structure, Muscle Definition to Car parts from Rims to Spoilers and Dazzle-Me-Swiftly Paint Jobs... To Weapon Skins and personal Tattoos and fully Couture Clothing everything!, absolutely everything can be altered to just as you would like it.  Boasting one of the Most in depth Customization Toolsets in the gaming industry today still this game is hot for the Fashionista,Car-Candy Enthusiast and Pimp-My-Arsenal Gunfreaks out there.   - 10/10 Style - 8/10 Gameplay - 6/10 Matchmaking - 5/10 Playerbase Maturity - 10/10 Replayability - 10/10 Customization - 9/10 User Interface - 8/10 Graphics - 8/10 Gameplay Mechanics - 9/10 User Friendly-Learning Curve  Overall : 83/100  The Features have constantly been upgraded and with the only downside of this game being frequent hackers and avery immature playerbase (to be expected it is Glorified Cops Vs. Robbers afterall). This is a Heck-Yes resounding I will play this game until the servers go offline.  
3794	1	a	Not Recommended for people who don't understand that this is just a game.
3796	1	a	Not a bad game its just too fun and addicting
3798	1	a	There may be some problems with hackers and whatnot, but it is still a very fun game. My guild has been playing it for a long while and they stand byit, as do I. I give it 6 .5 out of 10, higher if there were little to no hackers and the outrageous marketplace prices.
3800	1	a	When I first downloaded this game I jumped straight into it and have played it for 62 hours in total, it has its ups and downs. But also holds a great downside which is where newbies are being put up against veterans/experienced players. This could be fixed by adding 3 servers, one for low levelled players, one for higher levelled players and another one for mixed players where low levelled players can still go up against higher levelled players, this would be good because you could have a friend who is a much higher level than you when you're only level 1, you can just jump straight into the mixed server and join him/her
3802	1	a	This game is awesome until you start playing it...
3804	1	a	Css meets Gta, cant go wrong with one of the best f2p games out there. Choose crime or justice, get out there and get to it. Like Css, its a game you can jump in for a bit and play if you have a few minutes to burn.
3806	1	a	The game is really fun when played alone and with friends. Played the game for some time and really liked it. I recommend it to all fans of TPS games.
3808	1	a	It is great for free roaming with friends but anything outside of that is pure pay to win and is not recommended.
3810	1	a	The mayhem of a crowded server can be a lot of fun, but the repetitive grind and general lack of anything interesting to do become quickly apparent. But hey, it's free.
3812	1	a	This is the greatest pvp mmo ever.  Best customization of all time, you can be anything or anyone. Community is quite horrible but also hilarious, think barrens chat in vanilla wow. Great for casual players who want to shoot up other players and blow up cars. You need a lot of practice to get good at all the different weapons and you need to put in a ♥♥♥♥ tonne of hours to level up and unlock weapons like osmaw (rocket launcher). When you finally get a grasp of what to do it offers the best pvp experience ever, but be warned players who are grouped up in clans are very difficult to beat which offers a lot of challenge. Ive been playing for over 1 year now and it still offers challenges and difficulties because your always playing against other players who are very experienced. For new players they have a tutorial which is very easy to understand but also lets you join in the game immediately and play with others.
3814	1	a	Its a good game try it if you are bored
3816	1	a	Clocking in 1k hours in this game really makes me see how much i love it. It's been a while now since i played because once you reach the top levels the progress is a bit slow and the updates takes a long time to come out.  The new anti-cheat system really have cleaned up the game and the name-shaming in the chat is not nearly as bad as before which makes the game more fun and nice to spend time in.  Make sure you get some friends in Skype/Teamspeak or similar and play together, that is how the game should be played.  I am definatly returning to the game when the Unreal Engine 3.5 update rolls out!
3818	1	a	If you like free roam GTA sorta games, its for you. It's a bit of a grindfest but its all in great fun, also if your an aussie the best server you can go on is probably Colby it has less than 200 ping which is awesome for an mmo, overall 8/10. Sexy Game.
3820	1	a	Nice game
3822	1	a	its like a gta for free!!!
3824	1	a	I press K Wait for Opp Get 2 gold and 1 bronze Get my a** kicked Rage and get off game Start over
3826	1	a	Updatwe 3/13/2015 After reinstalling it I checked out the game again with a new character and found out I was just in a dead server. The game itself isnt bad but is defiantely far from perfect.  _____________________________________________________________________________________ I really want to give this game a shot and recommend it but I cant. No one plays it. Hopefully the game will get a surge of players on all consoles when it comes to Next Gens.
3828	1	a	 http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?s=c6c18dcff1b4d22ca36ee6651b3c8bc0&amp;t=2316602   THIS... READ IT! Cuz its VERY present in the game you (almost) wont find a signle server without a hax/cheater.  The game is still very enjoyable, when you got a decent team. Do know the hax CAN be defeated theyre limited in their hax.   Worth to pay for ? NO, not at all.... Worth to play ? Yes, definitely... Well and it is FREE to play now :) 
3830	1	a	This game is basically Saints Row 3-4 and GTA Online having a baby then shipping it to the 'Free-to-play' section.
3832	1	a	It's to awesome ;)
3834	1	a	Its Fun!
3836	1	a	I put a yes as it isn't too bad a game anymore (used to be very buggy and had insane car lag; since for some reason they're server side). While there are still pay to win elements it doesnt seem as prevelant. If you have a decent computer and some friends it can be plenty of fun.
3838	1	a	As I can see, the game is still fun and so. But the developers should/must work on that System of the missions, for example your friends are 'silvers' and low levels but you're still starting against High levels (Versus you). I think It's the only annoying thing in the APB Reloaded. I like it by my own, But I'm thinking about other people as well. And 'Yes' I recommend this game.
3840	1	a	69/10 it was good found van with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on side the drivers name was bigdicman. 10/10 name 10/10 van 420/10 i felt like it was real life like inception  and call of duty
3842	1	a	it cools
3844	1	a	spawned in with like 3 friends, some guy named RIPINPEACE comes up with a gun   and so on and so on
3846	1	a	I have spent thousands of real money on this game in all the years its been around since the beginning of the first owner. What I can not stand in this game is the cheating. Any way shape or form of cheating is a slap in the face of all the true supporting players in the game like me. This game is losing so much by allowing so many cheaters play without punishment. Just get rid of the cheating in game and all is well. Thank you...... Viper6........ Cop
3848	1	a	Few years ago then this game is good. Now too many damn hacker online using aim-bot. How did I get snipe by the same person 10 times? I was hidding so well that he can't see me.  Pros: Full customise from players to cars  Cons: Not so many legit players online Need premium to use the customisation feature  Mostly a P2W games. I mean mostly. Why? Guns. You can buy it with real cash or buy it from other players. All of the good guns need cash to earn it forever. Few quest let you keep a gun or 2 permently.  Guns: How to get guns permently guns without using real money? Farm In-game cash and buy it from player shop at the social hub. In there, players will sell permently guns there where you can keep forever but it cost a lot which is hard to get.  Do I recommend you guys to play this? No because of too many hacker using aim-bot or see threw walls. 
3850	1	a	i will admit i have played way better games but this is a pretty good one. you will probably need a friend and it might be confusing at first this game but keep trying it gets really good 
3852	1	a	Semi-GTA style. But looks good afterall, We need more player please.
3854	1	a	Don't go on random servers when bronze/silver I learned that the hard way
3856	1	a	A little P2W, but it's alright. Some fancy gameplay not found anywhere else, though you can't really buy any weapons without paying for it. Don't purchase, you have been warned.
3858	1	a	Its Fun
3860	1	a	apb is a really fun game it provides lots of customization and u can go out on the streets of san paro with friends and start doing missions or just fool around its up 2 u.
3862	1	a	This game is the bomb! Must Must Must play
3864	1	a	Fun game. Still getting used to it.
3866	1	a	this is a good game but the olny thing i dont like about it is the car system if thay can make the car system like saints row car system or grandtheft auto car system i dont play this game any more cuz of that
3868	1	a	after much playing the game i have to say its great. unlike many free to play its not exactly pay to win. there are micro transactions and things like premium but u can get around those. u play against other premium or non premiums and u wont notice. at the begining its tedious, u get killed alot and will feel awfull but its actually just skill. i havent encountered any actual hackers just realy good players. my advice is to get a friend or make some online and enjoy this free to play master piece
3870	1	a	Very frustrating match-making system in this game... It's like paying players are deliberately put up against the weakest enemies and the non-paying players are put against the hardest ones... Absolutely THE MOST pay-to-win game... Only one hitbox... ...like, for the whole body (no difference between a pinky-finger-shot and a headshot; same damage dealt)... Worst community EVER in the history of gaming, EVER... Seems like a ton of server problems, but nothing major/game-breaking, really... The game can make you think twice about any kill (you start to think that everyone's a hacker; maybe they all are)... Bullsh*t missions with BS locations... 'Carry missions' always sometimes end with the far more powerful team holding the 'objective' in an unreachable place... Again, TERRIBLE community made of complete A-holes... Forums are a NO-GO zone because of the above...  BUTT!!!!!  The idea behind the game and the customization and the amount of fun you can have in this game, far outweigh the problems with this game. Incredible idea... Some days I just drive around doing nothing but staring at stuff on the map...
3872	1	a	Its really fun to play with friends :D
3874	1	a	full of ♥♥♥♥ing hackers who cant play the game normally.
3876	1	a	Good game lots of fun with friends!
3878	1	a	no asian server~ bored..
3880	1	a	how do i staert it 
3882	1	a	Love it!
3884	1	a	Very awesome, 1st place in my games list
3886	1	a	Hacker Central, want a game that provide's a mass amount of russian bears that hack the game because they can't play? This game is for you, also it leaks you're memory like ♥♥♥♥. 4GIG ram usage after 10 minutes of playing. LONG PLAY
3888	1	a	Great game if you have people to play with. Just be aware that it's free to play so if you dont have the money to spend you may find it a grind. But i'm never going to pay to play and i'm still having fun.
3890	1	a	Best Game ever i love it and my shotgun 
3892	1	a	Okay now a short reply to Apb:Relaoded... its a very nice game! the custumization is awesome how u can design your own clothings and cars ! free how u want. the missions. nah, okay there are often hackers, where u really now that these guys are hacking. u report them. and FairFight bans guys, where u dont even heared their names anytime before. okay i hope that FairFight do is nest against all this little kids that cant even play and shooter without hacks. on the matchmaking there G1 needs to do something too like when u (as rank255) get matched against some trainies or rank &lt;100 !:D not fair g1 not fair. and one big problem of apb reloaded are the districts! all these golds wich are detreathing for getting silver and going on bronz district?! they are to low for silver or gold districts?! really apb?!:D do something against it!
3894	1	a	that game is awesome :D
3896	1	a	i dislike that when loaded the game doenst show it self full screen and i cant open it but still plays and i cant control it
3898	1	a	highley recommended even though my pc sucks at 1.9 GHz and a 256 MB graphics card i can still play with tons of lag and i love the game but please make a patch so it dont lag for me no more it gets annoying!
3900	1	a	Nice Game , i play this , and is very awesome with friend , (coop) 
3902	1	a	I don't exactly know how to put this, but in terms of rating this game. I'd give it a 7/10 only because of the costomization is practically limitless, but on the other hand it's full of hackusators and aimbotters. This game is biggest pile of ♥♥♥♥ I have ever played, BUT.... I keep finding myself playing it again and again only because of the customization... Thats my review of this game try it or don't....
3904	1	a	This game is awesome until you start playing it...
3906	1	a	Can't even believe I'm installing this again...
3908	1	a	this is a great game but i dont get the point of it plus its FREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
3910	1	a	333 hours played, enough said.
3912	1	a	I have yet to find a game with customization that even somewhat matches APB's. with a good amount of cars, clothes, symbols, and many other things that can be used to make your characters unique. Its always fun to go on missions with friends or screw around in the districts either playing the game the way its supposed to be played, to just racing around the massive maps. the graphics arent bad either.   My problems with this game are its neglective Devs any hostile comunity, in some aspects it can be considered P2W, because of the almost impossibility of gaining a permanent weapon without paying a hefty price for G1C. buying these credits isnt bad with the convertion being 5 USD getting you 400 G1C, but the price for one permanent gun(without premium) would be about 1500 G1C or more depending on the gun. It's very very taxing on leser systems and could make you computer run hot if you dont have good cooling.  if you dont mind only having guns for 10 days at a time or having your customization limited a small amount and have a higher end system, then this game is really great and very fun to just play anyway you really feel like playing it.
3914	1	a	Like a MMO version of GTA:IV  I'd recommend it if you have someone to play with. The customization is pretty innovative too.
3916	1	a	I've played this game since it came out not only the hours I have on steam and I gotta say this game is awesome, play with friend and you will have a lot of fun, sure it has hackers like every other online game, is it p2w, I don't think so cause with the starter weapon I've killed guys with Armas guns and was not that hard, the skill plays a  good part of the role here. 
3918	1	a	Great game
3920	1	a	From a totally honest standpoint, I had my objections when I downloaded this game, I thought 'Will this be a pay2win?, Will there be uneven player matches, Will there be hard quests and laggy servers?' Well of course. being the APB is a one of a kind MMO, it's bound to have so many negative features, but what game out there doesn't?  APB Reloaded is an action packed third-person POV game that makes you really on strategy, teamwork, and gear, and although there is a pay2win aspect, you don't need to buy gear just to be a great player. The missions do get repetitive, and it seems like the characters all give you similar quests, which is a downside, but the multiplayer integration goes along well, and most matches have several parts facing you off with opposing forces.  The game is glitchy, to be expected, but it isn't terrible. There is not much lag, and the ragdoll physics are a personal favorite of mine. One thing I do have to say that bugs me is if your car is going about 70 mph or 5000 km/h and you eject, the game gives no ♥♥♥♥s and you get out unphased. Please fix  Overall, it's a quite smooth, relaxing game, that's really good to play with friends. A big tip to getting famouse would be to make and sell whatever products you make. Always take requests and form alliences at the social districts, or in missions. And lastly, just have fun. Don't let what people tell you to persuade you to not pick up this game, it's a good waste of a few gigs. So see for yourself. If you found my review helpful, please thumbs it up and let others see how good this game is.
3922	1	a	Lagfest. hacker fest, p2w and not p2w at the same time.
3924	1	a	Awesome cops and robbers style gameplay that pits criminals against enforcers. Crims get to ram-raid shops for quick cash and Enforcers get to use 'less than lethal' (LTL) weapons to bring an enemy in alive by arresting them for more points and cash, along with 'witnessing' crimes by pressing ALT on a criminal commiting a crime in order to get a bounts mission on them.  Overall a great game with tons of customization options and a wide variety of weapons.  A solid third person shooter with a solid style.  9/10 [Mersey seal of approval.]
3926	1	a	this game is the best but i wonderd what if i riched the last lvl in the whole game  would it be fun?
3928	1	a	good game, lots and lots of customizaion. It blows Skyrim outta the water with customizaion options. Lots of hackers though...
3930	1	a	Wasn't expecting this game to be so enjoyable
3932	1	a	This is game is a pretty good game but they could make changes to make it better.   -The responding time when you're driving is not fast enough -Hackers are starting to dominate the game -Broken spawn points -Skin texture issues when you load up -Can be boring sometimes, repetive missions  -Finding a mission takes a while because barely anyone plays this anymore -They should add bikes  -The Asylum thing has not been open for a while, that game mode made the game really intense and exciting -Laggy as hell  I stopped playing this game because it became really dull and worthless but if you like free roam,action games then try this game out.
3934	1	a	Great ♥♥♥♥ing game, but just too damn laggy, but its still fun nonetheless.
3936	1	a	Game is very gltichy. While very fun, the menus are covered in programming error. The game does not go fullscreen or open a Window but does a odd combonation.  I also got kicked by an Administrator for trying to open a door to a building (Im new)  Bugs need to be fixed.
3938	1	a	If you're just starting this game, once you reach Silver I recommend you do not go on Silver districts. Go on Bronze districts otherwise you're going to get destroyed by all the Golds on the Silver districts.  This game is not pay to win no matter how many people who tell you that, it really isn't. Basically every gun can be countered and most guns that you can access using G1C (Paid Currency) are just reskins of the normal guns that you can unlock within an hour or so of playing.  I also recommend you use all the free redeem codes that are floating around somewhere in a guide on the Steam community. You'll get free Premium and stuff.  If you don't like it within the first 15 hours of gameplay, you won't like it ever.
3940	1	a	Really fun, if you are looking for a gta-like experience that is free. This game is similar to gta in the idea of the game, but the mechanics and gameplay are very different
3942	1	a	Great multiplayer game. You can have fun alone or with a friend or all of your friends at the same time. But there is a problem with the hackers,as you all know there is hackers in all the online game.
3944	1	a	It is a very good game yet some people still say its P2W .... Let me tell you ... it is not
3946	1	a	This game is good. Anybody who is bored should try this game, it's worth it.
3948	1	a	Nice game
3950	1	a	OMFG this is an awesome game and i can only say one  PLAY THIS GAME !!!!!!
3952	1	a	This game is a great game it is a little bit of a grindy game but it is fun driving around the city of San Paro you can play as a enforcer or criminal you can choose. on the criminal side it is easier to make money on the enforcer side you have acsess to police cars and different clothing items
3954	1	a	How come i cant get good graphics? iz is cuz Teh Crims hate me and hacked ma data base and made my eyes go 'ITS SOO UGLY' due to the games graphics can someone tell me how to fix dis? 
3956	1	a	If you want to put money into the game, it will help. If you dont,always rekt people.
3958	1	a	seems really interesting so anyone wanna try it with me? 
3960	1	a	This game is awesome I have over 400 hours. If you are a FPS n00b you will suck at this game, get owned, and rage quit. Theres plenty of action and you can hop in and out of the game with no hassle. Little to no bugs. If your computer sucks the game will run ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and you will rage quit. So basically you dont like this game if you suck and your computer sucks.   HIGHLY RECCOMMEND PLAYING THIS GAME 10/10 **********
3962	1	a	Phil want's the game, so please get it for him guys srsly.
3964	1	a	lag a lot, hackers, but the overall game is a nice concept, actually it kicks ♥♥♥, only two series better than this, gta and sr
3966	1	a	i like this game very hot .. and intense gameplay.. LOVE IT.... &lt;3
3968	1	a	Although it has some problems with cheaters and 'never actually coming' engine update, the game itself is really addicting and I have no other choice but to keep playing it. Don't get me wrong, I love the game so I hope it will get it's sh*t together :)
3970	1	a	This is a pretty fun game if you dont rage quit and get better at it like I did.
3972	1	a	APB IS FREE! UNREAL!
3974	1	a	how to register guys 
3976	1	a	Hey guys you want to play a huge open world game that is free! Get this game today. I have fun in this game alot and I want you to come and play with me. This game is so big its separated into three different districts. The custimization is mind blowing, and when you make a charcter pick enforcer.[ Not saying its bad to be a criminal, but enforcers are better ] See you in game  Name:MelonMelom Faction:Enforcers Server:Colby NA East 3001  I play on waterfront now so find me there and if you have skype let me know cause I can play very tacticly, I guess thats it. See ya later 
3978	1	a	this game is truly epic. Basically a free saints row, but with more people! :P
3980	1	a	I think this is game is just like Gta probably 9/10 but as we all know GTA is better
3982	1	a	Character creation for this game is pretty sick! You can choose boobie sizes and how buff your dude can be. It's like GTA basically. You can steal stuff and grab objects to kill the other party. This games all about 'cops and robbers'. So, you can be the bad guy or good guy if you want to.  Server location kinda sucks cause it's only under US, EUR and HK.
3984	1	a	With APB, someone says it's P2W Game, Yes sometimes I feel like it is. But that's when I'm in a losing streak. I just freaked out. Really freaked out. I just stop doing the missions. Open my browsers, and try to make a cop car as close as the real one without using more than the game privided slots to put vynils on. And I find out it's really relaxing. It's also having a Music-generator-thing in a Social Server, Sometimes I just logged in to create some paino covers of my favourite music... and sell it, and when I selled it. I got more money to purchase some new car ro decorate.   Overall it's a fun game to try.  And for newcomers   · I recommended you to try to do all the training the game provide you. It helps a lot  · Try every single guns type avalable in the game. (Rifle, High Valocity Rffles (Sniper), Shotguns and Less than Lethal for EX, you may fall in love with some of it, For me... It's High Valocity Rffles ;)... Which will be more awesome than you having a 'almost complete' stopping power in you hands, right? )  · Try driving around San Pary City in every car, It have diffrents handleing. and sometime your driving skills may make your team win too.  · If you're on a losing streak, Just quit the game, or do something else. This one is also recommended method for every game. Don't push your anger beyond it's limit. It won't help but draging you down more and more.
3986	1	a	great game thou i dont like the player vehicle system where you can only drive ai cars, your car, or people in the same mission you are but other than that really fun open world mmo
3988	1	a	hackers galore 2015 will play again
3990	1	a	one simple word AMAZING!!!!
3992	1	a	Havent Played it yet :)
3994	1	a	Improved from original, people are actually playing it. Fun, however this game is a major ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ magnet. Play, don't give a damn, and you'll have a blast. Outside of the lag spikes on both east and west coast servers...a worthwhile venture into MMO 'Cops &amp; Robbers'..
3996	1	a	4/5 A must have for pvp shooter fans!  APB is a Cops vs Robbers style shooter that takes place in a large open city environment. Players can que up for team missions that turn into pvp brawls all over the city. Players that are not in a mission will not take damage; but if a cop sees a criminal that is stealing a car, mugging a civilian, etc... that officer can start a chase event and even call for back-up. All in all it is a very fun game, full of very skilled players. I'm halfway decent at shooters, yet I get owned most of the time in this game.  The game also allows you to customize the crap out of it. You can customize your ride, clothing, graffiti; even the playlist for your car can be up-loaded so other players can hear your music when in or close by the vehical. You can even produce a short tune to play when you kill someone. I have the piano part for NIN 'Hurt' that plays for anyone I am lucky enough to kill.  If you don't like playing with other people, you may want to skip this game. Pvp is like 90% of the game.
3998	1	a	Not bad for a game that looks like gta but the graphics are a bit buggy
4000	1	a	closest you can get to gta for free
4002	1	a	This game is amazing i hope that the makers will soon make it that you have to buy the game...it is way too good to be free!
4004	1	a	awsome just wont work for me please fix 
4006	1	a	11/10-ign 2 little freddys 2 mennu hekers -spooderman   You should play this game. One of the best F2PTPS(Free2PlayThirdPersonShooter) 
4008	1	a	fun, good customization, pleanty of cars, lots of clothing,customization scrolls, etc.
4010	1	a	APB Reloaded is an alright game.. it feels kinda like GTA's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ cousin. Its biggest problems is pay-2-win and matchmaking. 6/10
4012	1	a	Very addicting, even if it's a bit repetitive. Admittedly it's hard to progress without premium once you get to a certain point, and a lot of the premium weapons are overpowered, but not to the point where you NEED them to do well. Admittedly, I haven't played in over a year, so this may have changed.
4014	1	a	The game is pretty much pay2win. You need to pay with real money to get the supergood stuff like cars and weapons. The weapon recoil is insanely difficult, but the game has it's charm.  Pros: Awesome customization. The cars look nice. Unique way of getting money via stealing from shops. Multiplayer. There's a social district where you can relax.   Cons: The cool stuff is pay2get. You can't use fists as weapons, so you are stuck walking around with weapons. Most weapons only have 4 magazines, and you burn through ammo superfast. No single-player. Weapon-recoil sucks. Driving is weird. You can only play on 2 maps/districts.  Do I recommend the game? Sure.
4016	1	a	gta V PC, but came before the actual gta V pc
4018	1	a	this game is realy fun so i will give it a thumbs up the only down sides to this game is the 50 minute time it takes to load and the lag
4020	1	a	great game ive always wanted grand theft auto v but this can work the same as it so yeah 
4022	1	a	Well this game is great things that are premium are just about the same as the ones you can buy through earning my biggest problem is that all the cars in this game even the premium ones are so hard to drive and in a mission some times get paired up with pros and guys who pay to win which is unfair.
4024	1	a	I have played this game over the 300 hours + and i liked it. A lot of people are saying this is a P2W game, but i don't have problems with that xd.  I hope you all enjoy this game like i do :D.
4026	1	a	-spawn- -man says lets do something fun- -i say kk- -he kills random man- -police come after us- he drives of a bridge and kills us both- -rage quit- 
4028	1	a	Incredible fun,you get to play a lottttt to get a awesome car and stuff but all in all its a great game!
4030	1	a	it more like a cop and robbers type game 
4032	1	a	Would pay if it wasn't free to play.
4034	1	a	The game is good but why is it taking its time to load i mean like i have a windows 8 it should run pretty fine...should i just download it from another site or whatever? 
4036	1	a	This game is good. I suggest paying to win if you decide to play if not use you're starter weapon forever LOL Star to OP
4038	1	a	i agree it isnt the best game it isnt gw2 i know (♥♥♥♥ u gw2 rules)  but: its free fun u can do allot hentai van weed van much custom not so pay to win i killed pay dudes with starter hand gun so f them its skill u no like game? well ♥♥♥♥ YOU its free to play stop hating start playing this game should be loved for its free to play its misions its players and its hentai vans!
4040	1	a	Rating: 7.5/10 - Solid, but needs some adjustments.  Overall, the actual game is solid. The graphics are good, the User Interface is simple and the tutorial`s easy hotkey of 'T' makes it helpfull for a new player to catch on. The customization is limted for non-premium but it still gives you the ability to customize your car and wardrobe with earned decals, etc. The main drawbacks of this game are the actual Player Versus Player Combat. It literally is a gamble for fun when you join for missions. Most of the time you are pitted against players that are higher rank that can kill you quikcly. In time your player gets stronger as you rank up and you understand the game better, but there are still matches that just aren`t fun at all.   What is nice about the game is at a certain time, the game will reset its servers and ban any found hackers or cheaters. This really gives hope for future fun and you`ll know that if someone is cheating, the next day they will be gone.   The community sadly is vulgar to no end with little effort to help others. This is common in any online game but the rating of mature gives people free-will to say more than the typical F-bombs.  The most irritating factor of the game is that you get trolled to no end. One can assume in a game such as this the trolls are going to be all over, but it gets taken to the next level one too many times. People running around crashing your car or blowing it up just as you got the cash you needed and since they have racers and preimum vehicles you can`t get away and your basically stuck. The developers should crack down on the trolling a bit more, its going to draw new players away if all they do is get blown up by a max-rank player all day. There IS a difference between goofing off and having fun doing whatever and outright greivancing. My suggestion would be to allow criminals and enforcers to see eachother, but keep the concept of no damage/contact unless in Player Verus Player matchups. Cracking down on the vehicular collisons and prohibit the ability for criminal or enforcer to jump into a civilian vehicle [since custom vehicles already have this feature] that has already been 'tagged' or 'used' by the opposing faction. This can even be limited to a few [aproximatley five] minutes to eliminate trolling. The car hitpoints and all of that will stay the same and the players must be in PVP mode if they wish to do any damage. Cleaning this up could effectively stop any trolling/greivancing or limit the behvaior.   My final words on this game are: If you want to play this game, be sure to bring some friends, It is a BLAST to run around causing mayhem as a criminal or cuff crIminals as an enforcer squad. Don`t play solo, bring a friend or three and goof around to your hearts content and you wont be bored. Just don`t play this game alone or it wont be much fun.
4042	1	a	APB Reloaded... Finally, a game that you can act as a police officer, and then arrest the criminal. Or with a few clicks, go to a seperate character and wreck the world by smashing storefronts and demolishing police officers.
4044	1	a	cant play 10/10
4046	1	a	Best customizable option ever put into a video game.
4048	1	a	spent all my money on cars
4050	1	a	Amazing game, spent way too long playing it. Had fun everytime though
4052	1	a	played this and having much fun, massively addicting and its a five star for this game, although its still in the progress of improvement , it served me just nice XD
4054	1	a	is cool
4056	1	a	meh....its a major P2W but really fun
4058	1	a	despite what people think about this game, i think its alright. one thing that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off though is that, i was making a design for a shirt, and it was pretty intracate, took me a few hours. then after all that hard work, i came to find that there were only 3 slots for items that you could add. yea. i was raging inside, but ya know, just gotta accept it. pisses me off how they do that, but want the money any way they can get it. i dont know, i was thinking of buying some in game stuff for it, but the way it did that to me, makes me feel kinda iffy.
4060	1	a	APB for life! &lt;3
4062	1	a	The Pros: Massive customization (Logos, Music, Character, Cars, Weapons) The Cons: Poor connection, bad and broken hitboxes, high cheater presence, bad matchmaking (a level one can be setup against a level 50 and so on) For the most part APB runs fine, connects fine and you have to be in a certain mood to enjoy the game, first time players may not enjoy it.
4064	1	a	I've played APB for about 2 years. I see alot of negative review concerning the game regarding poor matchmaking, bugs, hacking and most of all the community. To be honest I could not see APB nor could I enjoy playing it the same way if it weren't for those things. You are in a game where you can make yourself look however you want. Literally I've seen people walk around gunning people with what looked like underwear with a giant brown stain and a party hat. I've seen people paint masterpieces on the sides of cars and vans alike. I've seen people put so much detail in their characters they stand out no matter what. Everyone stands out somehow. You have your own personal touch that people will recognize. Your shirt, your car, your tie, your makeup or a tattoo. The customization on this game is endless and you can even make your own MIDI songs ingame. Sure they won't be pop quality songs but how many games can do that today in the MMO field?   Matchmaking is good the way it is simply because there are people who are on a higher tier than other players and pick on the newbies. This game is brutal concerning that one detail... Its f*** or die and granted that is sad but this is not a game that will spoon feed you skills nor will it hold your hand till you can walk by yourself. You can't just click a button or two to make your problems disappear. The more you play the more you will understand that it all comes down to two things. Skill and teamwork, with an emphasis on teamwork. The hardest, toughest mother*****r can be killed with teamwork that is guaranteed. However there will be times when its all you under the spotlight vs three other people and only 30 seconds left on the clock to finish the mission... You will probably fail but sometimes you will be able to shine. Once you put such a high bar in a game the satisfaction of winning is increased ten fold.  Now regarding the community... I want everyone for just a moment to understand something. This is a game where you either pretend to be a criminal or a vigilante (neither have a problem killing pedetrians at will). Its also an FPS game with things like 'lootable' money. Also let us not forget this is the internet... Do you really think everyone is gona be nice or play nice? People will insult you, they will hate you, they will bother you, hell if they could they would perma crash all your cars, steal your money and leave you without clothes. However... Every world is the same town, there are good people and there are bad people. I've met decent human being on APB who were not hell bent on defecating on your gaming experience. The community of APB in my mind is exactly how San Pedro would be if such a situation ever existed. Besides I personal find satisfaction being s**t talked by the entire opposition for 30min after I win the game.   To conclude this game is not for everyone and it requires a bit getting used to. If you read this review and decide to give it a shot don't worry about sucking at this game. Even after you become the proest of them all, to someone (or a few people) you will always be a 'noob' ;).  9/10 They don't get my full vote because I'd very much like to see new maps from time to time xD
4066	1	a	Boss of a game!
4068	1	a	APB sucked but no that another company took over and made it better.
4070	1	a	This is A very good Game everyone should get this
4072	1	a	Excellent Graphics, Interesting Concept, Hard to learn Gameplay. The gameplay for me is quite confusing and even after as much as I have played it, I mainly just get killed. I don't know if it just me but definitely give the game a try as it can be quite entertaining if you learn to play.
4074	1	a	this game is boss
4076	1	a	I don't know about you but i realy like it!!!
4078	1	a	This is a GTA (Grand Theft Auto) based game but you can customize and be a Criminal or a Enforcer (cop). APB Reloaded is a really good Free To Play game on steam. (It's so good i don't know why is only free to play) I think if steam put up the price people would still download (buy) APB Reoaded. I'm sorry to say that I don't know what APB stands for. If you guys told me that would be great. REMEMBER TO DOWNLOAD APB RELOADED!!!
4080	1	a	I recommend this game.
4082	1	a	APB Customer Service, srs business
4084	1	a	Near fully maxed out settings and stable gaming experience without any crippling FPS drops. Looks beautiful on the non demanding game engine.  1080P ATI R9 270 2GB GDDR5 AMD FX-Octa 8 core  8GB Ram Screen 60' Vizio E series at 60hz  I don't recall if I noticed any screen tearing or stutter, I will update review next time I play if I see any problems.
4086	1	a	Playing this was fun, i played this without the knowledge that it is actualy an RPG, therefore it if fun whilst playing with many members ranging 2-4 (including yourself) well i only reccomend 4 as you can only fir 4 people in one group but you can fir upto i believ 60 into a clan, this game is basically like any traditional MMo RPG but this is a bit more realistic and modern as it uses Cars, Guns Cops, Drugs and yea. if you ask me it is fun to play, play it if you have some spare money cause most MMO RPG's are pay to win, and this is certainly one of them! but it doesnt change the fact you can do alot for free as there are random events that give you redemption codes for premium member ship and more other cool gifts!
4088	1	a	I think this game has lost its consumers but is still a jem
4090	1	a	It's like GTA Online, but free. Customization is unreal, so much you can do to make your character.
4092	1	a	This Game recommend Third Person Shooter Skills. Its not for player who think they can play games since the first second, you MUST learn how to play this game. This Game is not easy!!!! I play this game now 3 Months and its really funny for me, but i am not a pro, im a good player ^^ so check the game out and build your own opinion.
4094	1	a	I honestly love this game, only downside to playing this game is that you need a good graphic card to run it. Every single aspect of it is really really good. The guns and w/e your threat rate is really scary sometimes depandant on how YOU make yourself either the badass hero, or the tormenting threat
4096	1	a	i recommend this game because it is like grand theft auto
4098	1	a	i would recommend this game because it has lots of hard work picking which side you want to be so its a really high recommended game.
4100	1	a	its a really good game i got it on gamersfirst then lost my account on gamersfirst so i saw apb then i could play forever unless i delete the game off of steam
4102	1	a	It's ok. A bit of a Pay to win game but ok
4104	1	a	This game is a whole lot of fun to play. There are still alot of hackers in the game which will force you to lose a lot of missions, and make you think that you are a horrible player. Gamersfirst is doing something about the hacking, so in due time, the hacking will go away.
4106	1	a	DUDE YOU GOT TO FIX THIS I CANT EVEN PLAY
4108	1	a	PAY2WIN game...would be good if not for that.
4110	1	a	I remember watching the YouTube trailers for this game back before it's first release. I'm glad to see it's still around.
4112	1	a	APB Reloaded is an awesome game, but only if you have friends to play with.   You can play missions together, rob stores together, kill other people together and all that other stuff. There are also alot of things to try out and to earn for especially cars and weapons.   The only problem here is that the game really stresses the fact that you should buy GC Credits from them. They're customer support also sucks and will do absolutuly nothing if you ever face any problems about the game.
4114	1	a	this game was fun
4116	1	a	this is a nail bitting action game   that uses all the computing ability of your sytem to make an experience in  gaming that will not be surpased in decades..
4118	1	a	seems like gta but better because i guess there are trailers.
4120	1	a	DO IT!
4122	1	a	The game crashed and spared me from having to play. Ten outta ten.
4124	1	a	I'm Commisioner Gordon by day, and the Black Mask by night.  7/10  Would cruise in Police Car to 'In the Air toinght' By Phil Collins again.  Would not get kicked off team before xp gain for 3rd time though.
4126	1	a	cool
4128	1	a	Really well thought out game - a bit pricey if you're looking for items on the marketplace; but understandable due to how the game itself is free and doesn't require you to buy anything for it in order to play without any hassle - ignoring the people who complain about it being a Pay2Win scenario. Buying marketplace items is just for vanity mostly. :)
4130	1	a	This game is AWESOME, been playing it for almost a year now. Ppl who read this. DOWNLOAD AND PLAY IT! :D
4132	1	a	can u fix the lag
4134	1	a	Its a really good game its like gta and yea so PEACE OUT
4136	1	a	i cant play the game it says NIVIDIA physx i played this game allready
4138	1	a	I find the game awesome. It's fun, creative, it has strategy, looks pretty well. I love the game, it consumes a lot of my free time and I like it this way, but like every other game it has cons and one of them is the ARMAS market: the real money shop. Ok you can buy some packs with cool clothes and cars... but the weapons are waaaay more OP than the normal ones... So the biggest con is that its kinda P2W, Im F2P and I get my ♥♥♥ handed to me by some good players with OP weapons. Huntorax (a PRO player and a youtuber) uses the valentine's day special STAR rifle and the rifle is the starting weapon in the game (The ''noob gun'') and he owns. The game has a skill cap, but if you have few bucks in the pocket you can almost destroy the skill cap. I personally love the game and want it to be a bit more fair with the people from poor countries (Im from Bulgaria). I recommend this game cuz Its fun and I enjoy playing it, oh and It's better to play with friends cuz the game needs some teamplay. Thanks for reading my review and see you in game :D
4140	1	a	I recommend!
4142	1	a	- Pay2Win -Not optimizzed -Low data reading -Cheaters (hacks AIM) -Enjoi
4144	1	a	This game is extremely great has it is the 'GREATEST' Police vs Crimials game i've seen so far in most games this game doesn't need any bad comments about it.I'm looking forward to even more updates added for APB keep it up guys :D
4146	1	a	this game is really fun and just a great game 
4148	1	a	-Tried to rob -Gets shot in the face -10/10 would rob again
4150	1	a	hit gold, aren't paid to win.
4152	1	a	it is fun but deffinitly is not free to play if you want to actually have guns. they start you out with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ weapons annd the most basic stuff. no more than a rifle a pistol and some clothes, while others are driving arounnd in their 30$ irl money cars with 10$ guns with their fancy clothes that also costs money. not a fun game if you want to play it FREE.
4154	1	a	Love this game although i wish the cars were less expensive
4156	1	a	♥♥♥♥♥
4158	1	a	i love this game but the lag is way too unbearable, let me know if it gets better
4160	1	a	There is a LOT of fun to be had here for FREE. There is SOME pay to win here, but a little skill can make up for it (If someone drops the absurd cash on a grenade launcher, you can still put a bullet in their face and make them regret their purchase). I have over 80 hours and I tend to hold my own against the premium players. I strongly suggest a test run at the very least, what do you have to loose? It's FREE!  Also, a HUGE player market. You can make plenty of game money with a little creativity (designing clothes/cars/weapons/music/etc).
4162	1	a	Cool
4164	1	a	2/10  - Interesting gameplay - Imba cash shop - Cash sink
4166	1	a	Well. I shot a police twice in the head and he shot me in my toe. I died 
4168	1	a	This is the game you are looking for.
4170	1	a	Its Awesome so I Recommend it
4172	1	a	This game ets halarious especialy when played with mates
4174	1	a	Game looks good but lots of kids online...
4176	1	a	Very good game. The graphics and physics could be a tad better, but, its a free game. Its a GTA Online with its own twist. I can't wait to get to play it with some friends again now that I have a better PC.
4178	1	a	Is this game maintenance or what? i cant even log in  is this game available in the philippines or not?
4180	1	a	Fix your game, i am stuck on the character menu.
4182	1	a	a fantastic game with awesome character and vehicle customization. You could also import your own music files.
4184	1	a	great game pretty mutch gta for free
4186	1	a	Great game, recommend it to anyone that is even slightly interested in it.
4188	1	a	It could be a great game if it was payed attention to more. In it's current state,I reccommend it. Only slightly however,as there are many cheaters,and it is rather laggy. speaking of which,i reccommend playing this on really good computer to spare you the trouble. It does have the pay to win aesthetic,but I love my guns anyway. Complete some tutorials and you can get a permanent weapon,and I love my rifle. If I had to give it a rating,I would say....7.5/10. It could be great,but it is sadly ignored by developers like that old carton of curtled milk probably in the back of your fridge.
4190	1	a	I will bestow thee hand of justice upon thy nipple.
4192	1	a	boss
4194	1	a	hi guys my friend have mac and he need to play this game plz someone tell me how Change mac to pc 
4196	1	a	fun game with a lot of choices for your character and alot of crazy fun in multiplayer
4198	1	a	This is a great FTP 3RD person Shooter
4200	1	a	Best game!! just download it and back me up in the streets!
4202	1	a	I like this game.... I really do   However it is a Buy to Win game since you can get the best weapon from the store aswell as earn them from ingame. You will also most likely encounter a hacker but mostly they're seen banned quickly so don't worry too much. Just chillout with some friends and customize your character to your heart's content!
4204	1	a	Awesome GTA MMO clone
4206	1	a	This is probably the best rage simulator on the planet.  I am a very in control person when it comes to fast paced shooters even when my computer physicly cannot keep up but this game has managed to release my inner anger i never knew i even had. But dispite all the times you will be angered, infuriated, and made really mad this game is actually really fun.  This game has great customization over your character and even over all the vehicles you own. You want chrome plated wheels you can have it. Police lights? no problem (enforcers only btw) and you can even make your own decals to put on your clothes and cars and even as your ingame logo.  The shooter mechanics of it are good in that it allows you to peak around corners, crouch, and even switch which hand your character uses. You can also take (except for enemy owned or someone elses personal spawned one who isn't in your group) every single car in the city a civilian is driving and use it and pretty much destroy every sign, car, etc... in your way.  Pros: Great customization. Open World Shooter. Matches, open world stuff, and close, medium, and long range combat.  Cons: Lots of lag and some issues with performance (for now they may fix it) Toxic community (its really bad with the occasional good person.) And the occasional aimbot that will get banned in the next few minuets but does not change the damage it caused.  10/10 Would rage, logoff, think, and log back in again.
4208	1	a	Awesome game. I would recomend that everyone give it a try.
4210	1	a	Cool!
4212	1	a	One of the most addicting yet horrible games I've ever played. Simpy amazing in the most ♥♥♥♥ed up way. I &lt;3 this game. G1 is horrid but they've done little other than make it more monitized and fix the lighting. Still one of my favorite's. I'll complain during the whole 8 hours straight I've played it.
4214	1	a	Good, free to play game! The best customisation ive seen in any game.
4216	1	a	Good game, if you into games like GTA.
4218	1	a	
4220	1	a	super cool game, awesome gameplay and style. there is a awesome comunnity if you arent good at the game cause if you rek people you hack. but there is a good antihack system in this game so hackers are rare. i can totaly recomand this game, find a clan with teamspeak and you can spend years on this game.
4222	1	a	nothing APB is great i played before and it was amazing 
4224	1	a	Great game aside from sometimes shotty matchmaking and a few minor bugs
4226	1	a	The game its self it amazing. But OMG i can never play every time i launch the game its just a black screen piece or crap. But i still recoment it cuz its a very good game.
4228	1	a	This game is fantastic. However it is hard for new players to get into it because of the amout of pay to win players. That does not mean quit. Just stay in a green or bronze District and get better. Pay to win players can be beat. You just have to have a large arrangement of weapons because pay to win probably only have a few guns that they use so if you find one that overpowers it then you can beat them easy. Every pay to win gun has a normal gun that can dominate it. Other than that slight problem the game is basically GTA just alot better and free.
4230	1	a	You will die a lot. And some people will make fun of you for dying. The community alone almost drove me away. I gave it the benefit of the doubt, though and am hooked. If you like open world games like GTA and Saints Row, but with more stuff to do and people to do them with, this is for you. Whether you pay for it or not. I'm so into it, I've dropped $15 for a 30-day Premium Account.  Note: Don't by guns from their store unless you absolutely feel like you NEED them. Total freakin' scam, right there.
4232	1	a	Simply put one of the best free to play games ever.
4234	1	a	Wish I could ♥♥♥♥ing play it.
4236	1	a	many fun, much osmaw.  I play for car surfer no other drive.
4238	1	a	A pritty fun game. u can be a cop or gamgsta. extream car chasings, lots of shootouts. pritty much all u can expect from a theme like that. and probably the best and most detailed caracter costumization i ever saw in a game.  Only think i dislike, or maybe am not used too. no headshots. at the end it comes 2 who has the gun with the most damage or who is tricky enough and gides behind walls or cars fast enough. At the end it is a pritty decent game, And funn too play
4240	1	a	i love this game 10/10
4242	1	a	Cancer...
4244	1	a	This game still exists?
4246	1	a	Enforcer Anaiyah approves. (thumbs up) get this game. Do it. Do it now. lol right now!
4248	1	a	Great fun until the pay to win homosexuals show up.
4250	1	a	It's cool.                                                                           DEAL WIDDIT!
4252	1	a	sucks
4254	1	a	The best part of the game when it's not even loading up for you   10/10
4256	1	a	'he's there' v2
4258	1	a	Its a good game, just the tutorial is friken useless.... otherwize its gud
4260	1	a	Wow this game is a great game i feel like this game is like a free to play saints row Deffinetly deserves a thumbs up i would give it 9/10
4262	1	a	i never playd this game yet any way so i am gonna try it out and meyby i'll make this public so you guys can find it :D :D
4264	1	a	i can't play it say the game is running but its not what do i do
4266	1	a	Great Game! Only there is 3 problems. 1 The Guns Are NOT permenent buys in game!This is bad for a Number of reasons such as getting stuck with 1 gun forever and getting in a killstreak for someone who bought stuff for real money! Next Flaw is cars! Because it takes numerous hours of framing to get 1 car that only looks good that you could probebley steal! Final Flaw Is Player Base! This game relies on that way to much! One Time I Was Playing as a cop and could not get in a Mission Untill like 5 or 6 Criminals Got in and i had to be the oposition! Overall the game is a solid 7/10 and i think it is really good.Also If You Want To See Me Play This Go To My Youtube Channel It Is Captain Narwhal!
4268	1	a	This is the closest FREE game you can get to GTA. Lots of fast cars, endless character clothing and design, and so many people to mess around with. Be good? Be bad? It's completely up to YOU.
4270	1	a	Bad ♥♥♥ hella lag though. Don't go in alone, people are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.
4272	1	a	Can you guys make it on PS3 as Play-For-Free?
4274	1	a	There is a steep learning curve, Hackers, and quite a few issues that Gamers First keep dropping the ball trying to fix. It can also be very laggy. However, all of that aside, APB Reloaded is one of the most fun games I've played
4276	1	a	Great Game. Its the best free to play game in a long time.All it needs is motorcycles Then me and my buddies will be EVEN HAPPIER.Click on the link to post things needed in apb.     http://steamcommunity.com/app/113400/discussions/0/523890681404812778/   
4278	1	a	Great game But It seems there is a delay in steering a vehicle like a .5 second delay so yea but Great Game other than that I wish they would expand the map and make more places to visit.... Other than that Well GREAT GAME! But It takes a very long time to load but thats ok So i would highly Reccomend this Game!1 If you have a good laptop/pc that can Handle hi graphics or you could lower graphic to minimal in options.
4280	1	a	Best thing on Steam
4282	1	a	The game was alright, I never really got into it, nor did I play it for long, but it was fun while it lasted.. I'd still recommend giving the game a try, although expect unfair match ups (the game is brutal for new players)
4284	1	a	The game is pretty good but theres some things that affects the gameplay -the pshyhics are insane -car steering is hard -if you want new weapons you need to buy them with real money -there are so much hackers -this is not for everyone but my game crashes my pc after i play 10 minutes 
4286	1	a	I really, really want to like this game, but it just pisses me off so much sometimes.
4288	1	a	It's a good game.
4290	1	a	A lot of errors when launching the game.
4292	1	a	So, about this game. First thing, if youre looking for something like GTA online with awesome graphics, this is game just for you. But if youre a guy that can not handle situations where your game just randomly crash, some 'servers' (districs) are laging no matter what PC and connetction you have and you you can not control yourself when youre getting ♥♥♥♥ed by hackers, you should look for other game. And alot peoples will tell you, this game is not Pay To Win. This is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, starting on weapons, that have mods and bugs that are overpowered, to cars that instantly explodes on touch can be only bought! So chosing to play this game you should get some friends into this game, playing solo here, is totally worthless. BUT! Game has largest customizable items, including clothing, weapons, cars, character, and I am not talking just about modifications, there are alot of skins, tuning for cars, parts for everything but it all takes months on free to play and even after that you wont be able to unlock some of those.  And this is only 60% I meantion right here, there are many things you can discover, join, learn.   So rate this game? From 1 to 5? 4! Game itself is one of my best I played in my whole life. But playing against Pay To Win players, hackers, or playing with random team is not fun at all. Including lags, bugs, well as I sayd, you have to play with friends and NEVER TAKE THIS GAME SERIOUSLY!
4294	1	a	~Note: I do not have any gameplay experience, this review is on my download/ intro experience.  The game takes 30 minutes to load, even after the game has been downloaded through steam, the games own downloader starts and redownloads those files and when the game has sucessfully installed twice, it takes another 7 or so minutes to load and then when the game starts it expects you to give your login details for steam, which is the easiest way to compromise your steam account. But what i did see from the intro made me think this game would be awesome if that helps.
4296	1	a	Pretty fun the only problem is the maturity level of other gamers outside of your match.The two teams are basically just aesthetically different with no real pathology difference other than the enforcers have a different way of leveling up based on their relation to the crims and they are easier to play based on gear and the fact that they are kind of parasites and bully's in the way that they relate to the crims and the crims don't really have a way to make it up other than fighting the enforcers so playing as a crim is tougher and is kind of I guess the main player class wit the enforcers being kind of a heel to the crims face. The weapons are kind of dumb and do not relate to the real world counterparts and lead to some questionable fire exchanges as well as a lot of disappointing outcomes for mission success' the cars are pretty cool because you can edit them to a standard of your liking aesthetically and physically and also the avatars are really the best part of the game, you can make just about anything you would like within the paradigm of what is giving to you by the company as options and the difference in options to a free player does not relate to those given to a premium, player, also there is no balance and the stated percentage of players that would can and are gold players is not real it is a hack heavy gay abuse chat room with poor gameplay no balance and a lot of racism homophobia and unacceptable adult minor interactions as well as you pay to win... But it's so effin awesome that you can basically destroy mentalists and austastic gaytards and they pay to lose that bad. You cannot rate a game this terrible in relation to legitimate products that have a standard of production applied to the creation of the end product, it is basically like the studio 54 of this era and is fun because it is a sloppy drunken attempt at an online Grand Theft Auto and for some reason has a really frightening consumer base gay minors attracted to a false criminal identity and anti social misfits that do not actually like to work for accomplishment or title of praise based on relation to those that are not as good as them. Don't expect much don't do any of the crazy things you see mental ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ doing and just enjoy it for what it is while it's here and remember how crazy it was after it is gone.
4298	1	a	this game sucks , not even a 4GB computer can play this game, only rich people can play this game , dont waste your time installing , it needs a biger GB , biger than 4GB
4300	1	a	This game is so addictive the matchmaking is abit buggy but when/if it is fixed this will be the best game ever wide range of customisation/so many guns, cars just eveything. I would reccomond nayone to try it out and play with friends for the best experience :)
4302	1	a	very good and nice to play.
4304	1	a	This game is kind of like a Grand Theft Auto game, exept only online. Not as much freedom as GTA but fun as hell to play with friends
4306	1	a	its a fun game but i think its a bit pay to win.
4308	1	a	Best online 3PS game by now
4310	1	a	APB RELOADED is one of the best online multiplayer game i have ever played! This game is manely fun with your freinds but dont let that stop you from getting this game, the game is still fun without friends all im saying is when you are playing with friends on this game you pee yourself in laughter even more than you do on your own playing this game. I like how you can creat and customize your charecter and make yourself look like a complete BADASS, also you can even customize your own car to make just as equally as BADASS as your charecter. You get a choice of being a Emfocer or a crimanal, you can pick diffrent districs and locations to spawn at and also you can even make your own group or join a group. There is so much good things to say about this game but i will just end it with this.......of the few hours i have been playing this game i have fell in love with it i like this game more than anyother game i own or have now. WARNING THIS GAME MAY BECOME ADDICTIVE!
4312	1	a	Its very fun and its worth the while
4314	1	a	I greatly engoy this game. heck, its my favorite game. the animations are a bit rough but if i had to choose i would pick apb reloaded. good job creators.
4316	1	a	yoin mah clan... shadows of the nassebjörns... its for only swedish people 
4318	1	a	This game very good i play so much and someday it crash always crash and no one want help me i very very play this game when i playing and crash Dricx_invallcall i dont remember please anyone can help me   my PC core i5 2.50ghz ram 4GB and video card intel hd family 4000 (intel hd 4000) please help me fix this crash
4320	1	a	Good: Missions are fun, team work, yay Bad:Pay to win kinda game
4322	1	a	this game is ok but it is cainda lagi il giv it a 8/10 
4324	1	a	At first, I was a little sceptical about how good and fun this game would be. I've received various feedbacks from my friends about this game and not too many of those feedbacks got me interested in downloading this game.  Nevertheless, I thought to myself, 'I cannot make irrelevant assumptions based on peoples' opinions and perspectives.' And I've got to say I'm glad i downloaded APB Reloaded. I've been playing the game for well over 30 hours now. And i have seen some complains about hackers spoiling all the fun. Well from what i see, there are not many hackers. I rarely face any of them when i'm playing. The gun play might not be the best, but it surely is A WHOLE LOT OF FUN. And not to mention the ability to customize your character and vehicles. It is simply outstanding.  The only thing that bothers me about APBB is the driving. Well, i have always been experiencing 2 second delays when i hit the 'A' and 'D' buttons to turn left and right in my vehicle. That is pretty much the only thing i have to complain about. Besides that, i have no complains whatsoever.   So, if any of you guys are still pondering whether to download APB, pondeer no longer. It is a great Free-To-play game. The only thing you have to get used to is driving. It only takes a metter of time to practice a little and you'll be fine and dandy. DOWNLOAD APB!! IT IS AMAZING
4326	1	a	this online game is fun and there is always something to do like if your and police officer you chase down criminals and if your a criminal you steal,kill,destroy etc... could be better in graphics but apart from that its a fun game to play. If i had to rate this game out of 10 i would give it a 8
4328	1	a	Stuff happens, you get money, spend money and repeat.
4330	1	a	Unique open world game where you are opposed against other players to defuse a bomb, recover stolen good, protect a vehicle, prevent from stealing and much more.
4332	1	a	I don't get all the negative reviews this game has received. I think it is hilarious. I haven't laughed this hard in a long time. This game is simple, fun, and just easy to really get into a match and start causing chaos. I know there things that need improving but to be honest I am having a total blast playing this. I'd recommend playing with friends because it's just so damn funny.
4334	1	a	I still like this game has alot of going for it but its already been out soooo long and they could have fixed so much stuff by now but they just dont.... They really just need to listen to the MAJORITY of the players not the 200 random douches that cheat on this game or just pay to win
4336	1	a	One day I was driving my Enforcer V20 (Mustang) just having some fun chasing vans full of stolen items while the guy on the passenger seat was shooting the hell out of a player escorting the van with a taxi. Another day I was on top of the world bringing people to justice with the huge barrel of my sniper, killing them before they can react. The very next day I am ramming and stealing everything with my Criminal character to make some money so I can buy a new van to transport even more stolen goods than my pickup truck already does.  When I am not shooting everybody down with either of my characters, I am designing a new vynil for my car or making a new custom tatoo with the ingame designer or changing my haircut to look even more badass! YOU can DO anything you want, BE who you always wanted to be (ingame or in real life), and when you get bored, IF you get bored, just change sides and repeat, join a clan and have some fun, earn money to buy everything available in the game or, if you have the skills, win even more money by designing custom cars, music, tatoos and clothes for the other, less capable people like me. (I said I design my own cars and stuff but at a very basic level. Check youtube for custom cars and/or clothes and you'll see what's possible to do ingame if you have the skills)  Just play it!!!  EDIT: I had to edit my review because of one simple fact... The community in this game is idiotic, seriously... Gold players level 255 are playing on bronze servers against level 50 players and when they get killed they do everything possible to kill you back and call you noob afterwards, even if their final score is 1/20/0... This game needs to fix the matchmaking AND their servers. It shouldnt be normal to have a server with constant 100+ms ping, and that is on a good day, never saw my ping dropping below 90ms and I have 100Mb/s connection at home, this is purely a server issue that needs fixing.  Don't get me wrong, this IS a great game, always has been, and don't listen to the people saying this game is pay-to-win, because people may purchase premium guns but if they can't use a gun they are dead the same, period.  That being said, I STILL recommend you to play this game, as this edit is just a warning of what you should expect, but only IF you don't mind being frustrated a lot until they fix the matchmaking and improve the servers, if they do it at all, since they prefer to add new cars and weapons...
4338	1	a	i recomend this as a GREAT game wen played in a group
4340	1	a	Still needs work, but is addictive due to the incredibly large amount of customisation avaliable.
4342	1	a	This game i really cool but always the same thing happening everyday i play it's the same missions and not much to do but walk around and wait for a mission to come (would probs be the same mission you just did) but if ur really into art and love to create and costomsize the game has alot to offer with that i go through dissusions and see very cool emblems and character's or if u love killing idc c:.... i like it doe
4344	1	a	APB: Reloaded still has all the problems from the original, which is mainly the gameplay. Combat has not been improved in the slightest and is still clunky and perhaps sometimes rage-inducing. On the other hand, the customization and pretty much everything else in the game is just so good. The game has a lot of charm and is worth the price of free admission, but actually 'playing' this game is a pain in the ♥♥♥.
4346	1	a	one hell of a good game :D
4348	1	a	its good. but only if u can get on. iv been on once then every other time i tryed i was kicked. could u plz fix that.
4350	1	a	download it. its free you cheap basterds&lt;3
4352	1	a	I recommend this game and its very cool its feels like GTA But fun I don't care if there is bugs and bad poor graphics all what fun there is. Its inside the gameplay it doesn't matter about graphics what matters is how you play in the gameplay! Why i like this game Shooting Stealing stuff Killing cops LOOT from players stealing from stores SO FUN!!!!!!!!!!! i cant stop playing at all1
4354	1	a	Awsome game!
4356	1	a	It has Nipple Piercings. 10/10
4358	1	a	This game is awesome, not a big enough player base, I would rate it 7/10.
4360	1	a	this game is not ♥♥♥♥♥♥ oh yeah if you dont like the comment then deal with it oh yeah join enrforce its cool
4362	1	a	It's not that good but it's not bad, i hate that you have to wait way too mutch time!
4364	1	a	10/10 would hero
4366	1	a	♥♥♥♥ yeee Im driving a car. What are you doin? DONT ♥♥♥♥ING SHOOT ME, NO NO NO NO THAT WAS MY ♥♥♥♥ING CAR\  11/10 Would drive and get shot again
4368	1	a	good game only issue is its pay to win
4370	1	a	had a lot of fun with it, sinnce there is nothing compareable still... cheating seems to have gotten worse and worse and the remaining players are frustrated and you'll get insulted every match.  the businessmodel is annoying since you can clearly buy power. if you don't care for rating it doesn't matter though.  this 'genre' could be really successful and i have no clue why noone else created anything like it. even 'gta online' seems to be a joke.... never tried it though...!?! ;P
4372	1	a	Apb reloaded is a great game if only people could stop hacking in game. I also think there should be a single mission thing for you to do by yourself to Rank up and to level up your contacts too. So you can do the missions your way and not your partner or groups way.
4374	1	a	Screwin around is awesome
4376	1	a	.
4378	1	a	OMG I Love this game. Best game. Just like GTA
4380	1	a	Love the character customization, its not hard to get good items (nor does it take much time), but the only con is the darn matchmaking (I have never been matched with people my skill level). But, over all this game is not to bad, it's especially fun with friends.
4382	1	a	This game is really fun ounce you hit Silver it can get annoying with how new most of them are, but when you win its even more rewarding since 99% of the time the op is golds, which really sucks when your new or just started over like I had. I played back when it first came on steam, then tried again a year later the load times were unbareable, then again recently on a urge to play cops and robbers. The ammount of improvements is amazing, minus it sucks that I constantly fight squads as a solo as I'm trying to get others to join me. Overall a really fun game, not at all intended for little kids with all the colorful lanuage you see. Also this is one of the most customizable avatar games I've played, sadly you need to know how to be good with Microsoft Paint, but really that is just a crappier version of photoshop. I'm in awe sometimes with what I see people have done, or made in the music program in it. It also allows you to import your own music so if you hate steam browser you can play your own in game. :)
4384	1	a	It is awsome game. It has a lot of designing detail. Its the best to play during the holidays and vacations.
4386	1	a	Amazing game when playing with friends!
4388	1	a	I really enjoy this game.....most of time. There are some times when the games lags like crazy. Roughly 3000 millisecond delays, rubber banding everywhere and bullets that do no damage are some of the most common complaints. But when none of this happens the game can be really fun: driving around playing with physics, mugging NPCs, ram-raiding stores, and “accidentally driving into an innocent bystander and sending them flying off into the distance.  　　There are premium weapons, and while I think that they are better than any free weapon, I have been able to fight back with non-premium weapons and have even been able to win against premium weapons, plus there are free trials for most of the premium weapons. There is also a player market for players to buy and sell things for non-premium in-game currency only. Some players sell premium weapons here, so if you get a ton of cash, you can buy a premium weapon. 　　Unfortunately the NPCs only sell timed versions of weapons, so you either have to keep buying the weapon or buy a premium version of the weapon with no timer. The game also charges for ammo and spawning your vehicle. While this was annoying at first, the prices are small and are barley noticeable latter on in the game unless you just keep destroying your vehicle. 　　There is also a decent amount of character customization that has kept me busy for way to long, things like cars, custom decals for cars, themes, songs, clothes, custom clothes, tattoos, custom tattoos, and options to change a characters body. However, it’s worth mentioning that while there is a lot of decal customization in the game, you are limited by the in-game designer, in which you can only use preset shapes and designs, but for a bad artist like me, that is actually very helpful. The same thing applies to the music studio, but it is not as bad, however, there is a way to play your own mp3 through an in-game music player and through your car’s radio. 　　All in all, I like it, and it’s still one of my favorite games.  Overall Score: 7.5/10
4390	1	a	i love poilici chase so i download this game i LIKE IT SURE PLAY IT
4392	1	a	This game has guns 10/10  No, but seriously now...  I remember really wanting to play APB way back when it was a B2P title as it was basically an MMO version of cops and robbers.  Upon getting into the game, it was actually pretty entertaining and I have to admit that I'm terrible at PvP and figthing other players, but even with tha affliction I enjoy the constant struggle players trying to either uphold the law or smash it, and all its windows and garages to bits.  It's by no means a fantastic game, but it is fun for a couple runs with your pals, shooting at some dudes, stealing cars, and such.  Some of the animations feels a bit stiff but they're overall very nice and the customization options are fairly expansive, especially for vehicles, but the ability to run around town in a bandana with cowboy pants is pretty fantastic.  If you're more into PvP then you'll probably enjoy this much more heavily than I do or did, so load it up and give it a whirl.  Recommended.
4394	1	a	♥♥♥♥ yeee Im driving a car. What are you doin? DONT ♥♥♥♥ING SHOOT ME, NO NO NO NO THAT WAS MY ♥♥♥♥ING CAR\  11/10 Would drive and get shot again
4396	1	a	iz rly fun
4398	1	a	its a f2p, what do you expect?....
4400	1	a	Really Good Action-Adventure And Third-Person Shooter With Co-op Missions!
4402	1	a	ight game. 8-10
4404	1	a	Good Fun just dont think it's as great as GTA
4406	1	a	The design is far from mature and beautiful. Play it unless you love to shooting with massive other players or you enjoy drive cars in a sandbox.
4408	1	a	I loved this game. For those who are waiting for GTA V for PC to come out (and like me have pre-ordered it, got a new PC for it, almost commited suicide over the delays), then this is the game for you. It offers many of the same features such as CO-OP heists. However I think that this games main fault is that it is a free-to-play. Unfortunately about 10% of the players are hacking, paying or otherwise to try and ♥♥♥♥ off as many of the others players as possible. If you can get on a good server, I would say that it is a very enjoyable experience.
4410	1	a	Really well thought out game - a bit pricey if you're looking for items on the marketplace; but understandable due to how the game itself is free and doesn't require you to buy anything for it in order to play without any hassle - ignoring the people who complain about it being a Pay2Win scenario. Buying marketplace items is just for vanity mostly. :)
4412	1	a	Alright, not a bad game. However, it's more playable if you have a group of friends playing with you. Overall a 7.5/10. Remove the pay-to-win button, then we'll talk.
4414	1	a	The potential of this game is high and that was already noted in the fact that it was picked up by a secondary company and 'reloaded' to make it into at least something worth playing. The main issue with the game i would probably say is funding as it is a free to play game. I would say this isn't normally to much of an issue if they would have re-released it and then balanced it or at least tried to balance it. With that said you will find yourself constantly out matched, out gunned, and battered into submission by the other players. That is until you make it to the tip top and can finally find some way to hold your own. If the enemy players arn't enough to get to you, the chances that your own team's derogatory comments will. If you can handle the backlash from your own team, the constant balance issues, and the lack of dev well everything then enjoy.
4416	1	a	oh i see you are better than me, HAX
4418	1	a	Strongly recommend this game.  Possibly the highest customization you'll ever see in a free PC game, ranging from character appearance to car appearance to weapon appearance. Strong and intense gun fights, strategic play, teamwork, open-world, you can have fun when you're not even in a mission, collect items, patterns for your customization, parts for your cars, new guns, make your own theme song for when you kill someone, maybe you want to dazzle them with your impressive skills or maybe just completely annoy someone by using an annoying tone such as the mario death theme or the trololol song. The horizons of this game are only known by your creativity and skill. You want to use a car as a ramp and jump out mid-air and blow your enemies up with a rocket launcher? You got it! You want to stun groups of enemies, arrest them and dance around them while they're left defenseless and waiting for the timer to run out so they can respawn? You got it! You want to joyride? Got it! Want to steal items and cars to make money from them? Got it! Are you a enforcer? You can't steal? Who says you can't? Ram a criminal's car into a store and those items are yours to pick up, unless you want the criminal to put them in his car first and then steal his car with the rest of his stolen items, you can turn them in for cash too, just like they can. Want to host a huge group and muck around in the social district? YOU CAN. Want to voice chat to your team and other people nearby? YOU CAN. You want to tag your customized graffiti on a billboard? YOU CAN. You want statues of yourself? HAVE THEM. Whether you want to be good or bad, or a mix of both, there's something in this game for everyone, except for maybe children and pregnant women, well maybe pregnant women are okay, idk, go into labour and let your kid's first words be 'Hey brudda' ~ Wilson LeBoyce.
4420	1	a	Great game one of my favorites the customization is awesome i love it the only thing which i dont really like is that you have to switch districts just to change clothes or change your car but besides that great game
4422	1	a	Although it crashes on me a lot, I don't think I've found a third person shooter yet with so much custimazation and variety. Highly reccomended, if only to try once. Some of the weapons available from real money as opposed to in game currency unbalance some aspects of it, but not to a game breaking degree. Try it out, but don't drop any money unless you're serious about playing it.
4424	1	a	This game is so f***ing amazing! From the cars to the player models! Everything in the game is up to you! Change anything to your means, and play the style you want. Either a sniper or a rifler. Get the game right now if you don't already have it and start playing!
4426	1	a	aids and funny hackers
4428	1	a	Okay, So.. One thing i've noticed with this game is It is ♥♥♥♥in amazing Really addictive and fun I mean like.. REALLY fun. I've noticed that people who write reviews for this has a LOT of time put into this game and I can see why. One main problem with it is that the company behind it istoo focused on money I mean you can't say it's completely pay to win cause you can completely wreck someone that pays real money on the game.. And the ♥♥♥♥ you can but in this game is pretty much just mostly for customizability, you'll barely see a dude with a gun that they bought for real money cause the standard guns are already good I mean ♥♥♥♥ this game can run well in my old laptop so it's a bonus This could have been so famous and really just one of the best games in the past years  All i just want to see in this game is to fix the matchmaking and lessen the pay to win by even just a LIIITTTLE bit But if you dont want the sometimes broken matchmaking and the little pay to win aspect then i wouldnt reccomend this.. Honestly though I've made several friends in this game so i wouldnt call this community toxic.. It also has sooo much player customizability and vehicle customiabiity you can even make your own symbols on your clothes and cars or maybe buy premade ones Cars have good variety and ♥♥♥♥ it has a music theme maker thats pretty decent.. So I'd say I reccomend this for someone who deosnt mind those flaws.. I wouldnt reccomend spending money on this game though cause of the other reviews talking about the company's.. money care
4430	1	a	very good game. just like gta online mixed with saints row
4432	1	a	would be a bit cooler if everyone wasn't running around half naked or in kawaii animu clothes
4434	1	a	very nice game 
4436	1	a	hmm i love it 10/10 baby i love the gun skin
4438	1	a	This game is fun and action packed. If you don't have gta online play this.
4440	1	a	this game is amazing... I was looking for a GTA substitute and this fit the bill and more. I mean GTA you cant ram things and raid it! but this game includes a lot of customization which is awesome to express what you like in VG's. but in general a good game for anyone
4442	1	a	+ It's a nice game with decent graphics, and multiplayer. + Alot of nice vehicles, some new would be nice though. + The customization is out of this world, i have never seen a better one + Driving is fairly easy once you get the hang of it. + The game contains some nice tunes in it, that you can access anytime with P. + It's free for play, and not pay to play. + Premium is a nice touch, only that it's pricy, would love some more free premium days! - The matchmaking system is ♥♥♥♥, you end up with gold threat even though you are silver, and if you are gold you end up with noobs. - You usually end up with stupid teammates, and ofcourse they have the worst gun and can't aim. - Griefers with trucks, they ram, slam and kabam you into buildings making you explode &gt;:(. - People speaking other languages in chat even though it's EN server. - Waterfront seems a bit grey, try adding more colour to it. - The 'Whisper' is to OVERPOWERED and should be taken off the game.  i give it a 6/10 :)
4444	1	a	This is actually a fantastic game. For some reason my hours arent showing. But this game is fun, and free. Its basically GTA for free. Enjoy.
4446	1	a	This game has enough customization for any artist to crack their knuckles at. The lore is vibrant, the world is interesting to dive into and the game's combat system overall isn't that bad.  However, the majority of the community is ♥♥♥♥. There is also a VERY STEEP learning curve to climb before you can fully enjoy what this game has to offer... that is, if you're able to look past the faulty mechanics of being matched against more experienced players despite your introduction to the game. If you manage to make it past that then hopefully then you'll be able to ignore the enormous lack of optimization you'll encounter.  Honestly, there are a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of problems with this game, and even though I try to look past them they keep biting me in the ♥♥♥ alongside the constant aggravation I face wondering why I even bother to hope. The team might be too small to handle such a large game but I still hope G1 can make it into the game it SHOULD be and prove me wrong.
4448	1	a	I played this game and got all the knowledge.
4450	1	a	Quite a lot of cheaters (who won't admit it but then get banned the next day and say 'MAN IDK WHY I GOT BANNED') but overall pretty fun, with friends obviously.
4452	1	a	is one of the best free games
4454	1	a	Very fun game. You can customize anything:D. Game takes skill though
4456	1	a	I recommend this game! its like gta but its not as complicated in sorts of stuff...   It gives you more oppertunitys(don know how to spell that) such as: Making your own clothes, gangs and other stuff 
4458	1	a	I love playing APB with the squad because we can do what ever we want and have fun at the same time. this game also provides a next level of player custimization not seen in any other games. If you want your character to like like a stormtrooper wearing a pumpkin head you can, trust me Ive seen it before LOL. Anyways a great game and deffs worth a download.
4460	1	a	Had problems at the start, but a fairly decent game indeed :) 8/10. I rated it rather generously because it is a free game after all.
4462	1	a	Not sure if I can recommend this or not yet. So far it's been slow to load, and hard to figure out, but then Im old. lol But I o kinda like being able to mug and run over people so I'll give it a thumbs up for now.
4464	1	a	This game is awesome. Altough i only have 594.2 hours on record i do indeed play it a lot. And it has some hackers in it but they're rarely seen and when they are seen they can easily be dealt with. The customization is the best I have seen in any game i've ever played. The gameplay is great with no melee i think that it's awesome there is no melee so please don't add that to the game the gunplay is pretty good the Sniper Rifles are good with no scopes on them (like a standerd scope that would come with like the HVR or something like a CoD scope) I would indeed recommend this game. THank you for your time :D
4466	1	a	This is a pretty good game and it has SO much potential behind it that it's said to see it fail, it's kind of like GTA V with less better graphics, worse gunplay etc. but better custimization ( you can basically custimize anything ). I understand since its F2P but also, why tf is the driving so bad? The driving feels stiff and the game starts lagging sometimes for no reason at all. Also, this game is kinda P2W, u can buy guns that expire after 30 days without unlocking them, there are somethings u can only get if premium ex. more custimization and more op weapons. Normal weapons expire after 10 days ( which is quite annoying ) . Now, I understand, the devs need to make money, but why do Premiums have to be so op? For ex. as I mentioned earlier, more op weps, and they get basically unlimited custimzation which isn't fair. Personally, custimization is a HUGE thing for me, I absolutely love custimization, but when I'm told I have a limit, I get disappointed. Also, the weapons only premium can get are so unbelievably OP , ex. rocket launchers. The game feels incredibly satisfying, but you will probably get bored if you don't buy premium. Devs, PLEASE fix this, this game has SO much potential that it's amazing. All in all, I recommend this game.
4468	1	a	Its and good game but needs more updating and more content added. But it is an Free 2 play and its a good one. 7
4470	1	a	Start game make the ugliest looking criminal kill the police while wearing rainbow coloured clothes  10/10 would kill police while protesting Gay pride 
4472	1	a	Read stuff, adn you are perfect at the game, a couple of mintutes of me running around mugging people a girl askd me if I needed help and she showed me how to play the game! robbed people, killed cops and earned about over 10000 dollars in mintutes! so just play the game and ask for help!
4474	1	a	+ Lots of things to do, play missions, talk ♥♥♥♥ in district chat or just cruise around with your friends + Can customize a lot, make your clothes/gear and vehicles unique + Car Surfing  - R.I.P. Wallet - Poor matchmaking if you are new 
4476	1	a	This game makes me want to kill myself :) the graphics are five stars on yelp............ boi APB RELOADED more like KILL YOURSELF
4478	1	a	worlds fasties kicking game looks fun but doesnt let u play some how im getting kicked for just doing the tutorials its mainly 20 out of 10 thumbs down
4480	1	a	After I downloaded it and created an account, it said I couldn't play. 10/10 would waste time again
4482	1	a	I play a game for a bit, and i give it 3.5/5 engine upgrades
4484	1	a	i'm addicted to this game since it was released :)
4486	1	a	I spawned, i tried to steal a car, i got blown up... I resp-I blew up  10/10 would blow up again
4488	1	a	the game itself is lolful and bad but I do play it alot with friends just for memes. the player base really takes the game too serious and is the ulimate game if you want to troll. mixed with being highly customized. you can really make people rage and do nothing yourself. the small player base insures you can repeativly annoy them.
4490	1	a	Some people say this is a clone of GTA, but nope, it's something more than that!
4492	1	a	Hard to describe. TL;DR It's better with friends.  They take the best parts of GTA and ramps it up a notch with cool vehicles and a very skill-based third-person shooting mechanic. Cover and flanks are paramount, but the excitement is in the lack of cover mechanics, a very different kind of TPS. They also take the worst parts of any f2p and ramps it up a notch with p2w guns and vehicles. It'll be hard to contest with the majority of players because the only people left playing are hardcore fans who invested a lot. Yes, most of the guns you can buy with cash are just reskins of guns you can get with ingame cash, but there is a definite advantage to putting in the money. Missions are repetitive, but the fun is with friends, and the amazing amount of customization to character and vehicles.  I'll always come back to it every once in a while, but you'd best be sure I'll immediately uninstall cuz it's cancer. A good type of cancer, but a cancer nonetheless.
4494	1	a	Laggy, ♥♥♥♥ servers, toxic community, cosmetic items are expensive as ♥♥♥♥, gold players joining bronze districts, 255 players getting matched up against teams of level 5s, all in all a garbage game.  I love it.
4496	1	a	Well, the balance system is a do-it-even-exist but it has the most advanced character custumization system ive seen and the environment in missions is awesome so its worth testing
4498	1	a	Grand Theft Auto's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ cousin.  but still fun to play
4500	1	a	I accidently got naked and couldn't figure out how to put my clothes on. Then I ran around robbing stuff naked. 10/10
4502	1	a	Subjectively: Its not too bad.
4504	1	a	APB:Reloaded is very fun once you get past gettign killed by higher levels in lower threat level servers. Although there are some chagnes that can be made for the game through district and threat levels, it is fun to play with friends going from the lowest of the low to a high-ballin' pimp. My advice for startign out in the game is to not get angry and quit becuase you keep on getting killed by the same person who has played the game for longer. You will get there and then you can show them who the real boss is.
4506	1	a	it was always my dream to be a black criminal
4508	1	a	omg i cant believe how amazing this game is it turns me on
4510	1	a	Pretty fun game once you get used to it. Amazing amounts of customizing for your character and car. Missions get boring after a while but the people dont ;)
4512	1	a	400hrs And My ♥♥♥♥ is Still Soft...
4514	1	a	this game rules i love GTA and GTA like games this is like GTA i got it i love it
4516	1	a	While this game may be somewhat of a drag on your system, if your specs can overcome the hurdle it may possess, it is one hell of a shootin', lootin' team makin' FPSMMORPGRTS. 7/10
4518	1	a	The reason i forgot to eat, do my HW, sleep, and forgot about my headache for playing this for hours: I press k, i win a match, i am like 'hmm that was fun...' 50 matches later: I press k, i get into a match, i steal a jeep, ram into an officer, kill him, get out, get sniped by my teammate. I rage and right before i get off notice i pressed k by accident, then i am matched in, i forget why i'm mad, then i get die cuz i am driving a flaming car while yelling allahu akbar. I killed 3 cops like that. 10/10 would allahu akbar again
4520	1	a	.
4522	1	a	Theres only 2 side.
4524	1	a	I was playing this game since release and was following the massive revolution of this game. Awesome game with Rich customization system like: Cars, Clothes, Sounds, Symbols and etc. In another words very awesome Cusomization system. The combo of Shooter game, Cars and Multiplayer IS JUST TOO AWESOME. The good and the bag guys are fighting each other to decide who'll rule San-Paro city... BUT unfortunatly there is a BIG BIG BUT, the game is ruined, as I said, I was following the game revolution from the beggining and I have to say that the more Updates, the more pack they add the game becomes JUST WORSE!!! Meh what's the point... Just in the memory for the good olddays I make good grade but know guys THE GAME IS RUINED, DESTROYED, SMASHED, SUCKS, NON CARE ABOUT IT, FULL OF CHEATERS AND SCAMMERS!!!!!!!
4526	1	a	If you enjoy role playing as a fat chinese-african woman with thick blonde leghair, a crack pipe and an ak-47 then this game is for you
4528	1	a	
4530	1	a	Ebola Game :) been playing it for about 3 to 4 years...
4532	1	a	A lot of the combat can be extremely one sided sometimes, especially with a group of friends who know what they are doing, and have ranks in the 200's. BUT, What keeps this positive for me is how fun it can be to just mess around and troll people, as well as the customization. I can't give the most detailed review, if you want that, look at all of the others.
4534	1	a	Pretty fun, when you have friends playing with you in my opinion. Very awesome customization, I've seen some prety nice outfits and cars. Not much variation in PvP missions though, its always 'spray or break in to this' and then 'do it again over here' and then 'spray this or steal this car' and then its 'kill the other team or turn in the items.' It doesn't really affect me, but the Armas Market is something I would NEVER bother to spend any money on, not unless they were to reduce the prices on everything. Having to 'rent' weapons bothers me a little, but at least they give you an expiration warning and it doesn't cost too much.  All in all, recommended, but could be better.
4536	1	a	Great game, amazing customization options but a lot of downsides. I recommend everyone to try this! The feel of this game is highly individual.
4538	1	a	Left the launcher open for 3 days. Didn't notice. 10/10 would reccomend the launcher 
4540	1	a	uninstalled when it didnt work this is a effin good game my man
4542	1	a	i only play this game to LTL. cop 15 remaining: 0  i switched to positive because i made it to cop 15
4544	1	a	This game... is a ♥♥♥♥ up. BUT I cannot stop playing it. I guess it's not so bad. I have fun with it even though I hate it. The customization is mind blowing and the broken physics are so bad they make it entertaining.
4546	1	a	Nice game, but it freezes sometimes
4548	1	a	i love this game, its so fun. the only thing i do not like is that when you buy a car from the aution house, you cant costomise it in anyway, that gets kind of annoying, in other words though, i give this game a 8/10
4550	1	a	Played for like 5 hours in total. I love the car customisation. Boring after about 3 hours of gameplay. Repettive without friends.
4552	1	a	  Cool try this
4554	1	a	Its fun. You shouldn't expect very good graphics nor very good car control. The mission system is fun though its not perfect - still some things to improve. Also this finally gets its engine update. But well.  Been playing this for 800+ hours and over a long time period. Paused once but then came back. Also spent lots of money in it. Shortly before the engine update it finally happens, I get banned for some reason, haven't been told a reason why when contacting the support either. Sorry but that is bull_sh.it. If I get banned for whatever reason, it should be my right to at least know what I have done wrong. Besides that, the game is fine and fun and eats your time. But you shouldn't expect a graphical marvel.
4556	1	a	Gud Game  10/10 but Haxers in here dont trust anyone but family or friends f*ck this game i QUIT !!!!!!
4558	1	a	Laggy as hell toxic community unbalanced guns sounds like fun am i right? lol must try :P
4560	1	a	I haven't played this game enough to rate it. But i can tell that the ♥♥♥♥♥♥s, and weapons in this game are making it awesome! The only bad thing about this game is the community, 50% are hacking russian ♥♥♥♥♥. But i enjoyed myself. 9/10
4562	1	a	Eh . It's a good game , i playing daily , from now :D
4564	1	a	how to fix error disconnect  
4566	1	a	Cool game
4568	1	a	3 Good things and 1 bad thing about this game  +Best Car/Vehicle +Can Ram and Mug people +Good mission  -Bad F**kin*g community
4570	1	a	Forget about a good matchmaking folks :D (overall the game is good) just Hacks/Server connection issues/Horrible matchmaking...that's all i have to say
4572	1	a	I love character customization.
4574	1	a	I've been playing this game on and off for 3 years. There's something about it that's so addicting. Sure I have GTA and all that, but it's just not the same. It's a gem amidst all the other free to play games. Really it is...  There is a big emphasis on teamwork so grouping with a friend is recommended. Best character customization I have seen to date. It has its flaws and is highly pay to win. The matches are competitive but when you do kick a person's ♥♥♥ that has spent a ton of money on the game from outsmarting them and knowing the tips and tricks well damn that makes you feel like a god.
4576	1	a	 (Before I start, I am sorry for my bad English :P and i played this game over 4000h, but not always through steam :)m which means the shown hour count is wrong :) )     My reason for a review 
4578	1	a	Its it fun game but sadly its P2W.
4580	1	a	I used to play this game heavily before it was integrated with steam. Unfortunately I wish the game has improved and the developer had kept their promises on improving the game and making new maps not just one offs of pieces of old maps.   The game is riddled with cheaters.   If you are slightly decent the rating system automatically shoots you to gold where it can be fustrating loosing 29 matches then win 1 .   I once remembered the promise of a new engine for the game and a open world full on pvp map that would of been 100% chaos ... it never happend .  All in all if you have the friends and dont mind the salt mine still a better game than No Man's Sky
4582	1	a	The first, and only, standalone cops and robbers game. Open world too.
4584	1	a	blast your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ music in your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ car and act cool.
4586	1	a	This game is a fun experience if you have friends to play with! The only thing i can point out that i would nag about is that there are guns that are extremely op and can only be attained with in- app purchase, so the combat is unbalanced and pay to win.  The struggle between cops and criminals is an amazing concept that i wish more games did as well as this! Ram raiding, arresting, missions. It hardly EVER gets old.  There is an immense amount of character customization from clothes, emblems, spray paint and cars. You can let your imagination go wild when creating your style.  7/10
4588	1	a	It's a very nice game :P The Graphics aren't the best but alot of fun :D
4590	1	a	-.-
4592	1	a	This is a really fun game. It's similar to Gta in a variety of ways. However, It is very laggy, my shots don't even register. Sometimes I get shot through a wall right before the shoot, and It's irritating. It should be looked into. Armas purchases are pretty expensive depending. it's as if they want to suck out my wallet. There are hackers that just have no life at all. They can be pretty annoying.
4594	1	a	If you are looking for a game to play with your friends, its the perfect game for it. Whenever I play this game, I play it together with my friend and we always have a lot of laugh and fun playing it. There are of course some cons about this game like GamersFirst as a company, weak servers and its kind of 'pay to play', but not too overpriced. The more you play the more you can achieve without buying any ingame coins. The concept of the game is genius, its just not used to the fullest by the GamersFirst company. Overall its really fun game.
4596	1	a	This game is old, it has bugs, it lags, and you will probably face more cheaters than actual players. It's also really hard to new players, the pvp takes years of playing to master, and it is most likely to make people ragequit in matter of hours.  But, it also have a huge social aspect which no other game can replicate. The customization levels are impressive, and if you can look over all the bad sides of the game, it is actually a fun place to mess with friends. And if you have none, fear not: you can make friends easily just by chatting while getting your butt handed in a mission.
4598	1	a	One of the best games still out there
4600	1	a	the traler luks fun and exiting cant wat to play 
4602	1	a	Decent game, kind of pay to win but most weapons that you buy are just the same weapons you start with you have but reskinned. Lot's of customization and fun to play with friends and you can just absolutely ♥♥♥♥ around.         9.5/10 kill more crims
4604	1	a	it's better to play with a group of friends in this game, it's hard to go solo.   the aiming in this game is quite harsh, if you spray and pray you won't get anywhere. you'll have to practice burst-fire   oh and the matchmaking is kinda broken, it's not surprising for a bronze threat to get matched against golds..
4606	1	a	Fell in love the first time I ran over somebody
4608	1	a	I love the customizable EVERYTHING in this game 
4610	1	a	It is actually a great game. I love it. The customization is amazing. They could add a little more though and tweak the gameplay as in the driving and add diffrent ways to gain money!
4612	1	a	This game is tons and tons of fun! Get some friends together (or ride solo) customize your character, grab a gun and hit the streets. Cops vs Robbers, it's amazing. Do an objective and hope the cops don't get called on you, if they do, destroy them!  Much more fun played with friends, but damn I remember the amount of hours I logged into this game before it became free to play and lost a lot of it's player base :/
4614	1	a	hey this game lags for me i really hate it because this game is freakin AWSOME!
4616	1	a	The Original GTA online  Got run over by a van with a troll face and a sign that said 'Free Candy' on the side.  10\10
4618	1	a	i get to draw ♥♥♥♥♥ and other insulting icons on my car to strike extra fear into the enemies
4620	1	a	I'd love to play the game, but the launcher crashes everytime I open up the game. If anyone has any solutions, please message me, I'd really appreciate the help.
4622	1	a	one hell of a kick ♥♥♥ game!
4624	1	a	I found it to be very fun and enjoyable, the game dose not offer as much (if any) realism as other shoters, howerver its the content and the great custimazability that makes this game so great and highly adicting. If you want to try a new type of shooter with great possibilitys than try apb and find yourself glued to the screen!!!!
4626	1	a	I accidently left this running for like 2 days, but I played a good hour and made Paul Sr. from American Chopper. 10/10 IGN 
4628	1	a	Huge sandbox game of Cops n' Robbers
4630	1	a	Customizing.... mmmm tasty
4632	1	a	Great game, when the server isn't lagging or matchmaking is broken or you end up facing a hacker. But the customization is great visuals are cool and combat is fun if you can get used to it and the driving.
4634	1	a	Good game lots of hacker
4636	1	a	its a awesome game
4638	1	a	Nice to play !!
4640	1	a	Thisis Osam
4642	1	a	APB Reloaded is probably one of the most fun, yet simultaneously annoying games out there. Cops and Robbers with cars, guns and metric ♥♥♥♥tonne of customisation options. There's a lot of potential for it to be 100% ♥♥♥♥ing brilliant. Until then, it's still cracking good fun. Oh; and it's free. So why not give it a go?
4644	1	a	this game is like a low budget gta but its free to play and its rly fun.
4646	1	a	Fun game...if you are a GTA fan this game is like it.
4648	1	a	Great, fun and creative game with friends!
4650	1	a	There is a steep learning curve, Hackers, and quite a few issues that Gamers First keep dropping the ball trying to fix. It can also be very laggy. However, all of that aside, APB Reloaded is one of the most fun games I've played
4652	1	a	Really good free to play game and Specially if u like shoot guns and drive cars designe cars designe a caracther or more!
4654	1	a	Its so dang fun O-O
4656	1	a	I do recommend this game to all of you but i enden up playing it so much that i got banned, I was really good at the game and i would never intend to hack. But i only lost about 200 dollars and g1 gave me no refound so its okay i guess. Go ahead and try it the chance of being banned for not doing anything is ♥♥♥♥ing tiny i have 10 alternative accounts :D
4658	1	a	Its a great game. good things are that you can, edit your caracter 99% the way you want if you know how to and have the time, editing cars is a great thing when you dont rage YOU will, it goes on and on now bad things, No motorbikes please bring it to the game pls, if you dont have a friend too play whit you will be bored easly, the rage that you can get in this game is SO big, Its a pay to win game almost      Sorry for bad english BYE GONNA MISS YOU :(
4660	1	a	The customizations in this game are awesome....servers have been laggy as of late and there are some suspect players but very fun and addicting nonetheless.
4662	1	a	It's good as a shooter, the vehicles are varied and fun to drive, and your customization options have no equal among any other game. You can literally use the in-game symbol editor to make a picture and then put that picture anywhere on your cars and clothing. It's also really intense on RAM so try to have 8GB as a minimum. Also, this game isn't compatible with multiple GPUs, so if you run more than one GPU then you'll have to turn off your Crossfire or whatever you use to link them. The shooting works for the most part but it's not really innovative. What sets the game apart is its open-world environment. You queue for and play missions, play some 'cops 'n robbers' (criminals steal from open-world points and civilians, enforcers take their loot by witnessing them in the act and taking their ill-gotten gains), and explore and witness *other* players competing in their missions all in the same zone called a district. There's also districts for non-stop team deathmatch and objective play without queueing.  The community and game performance on most machines would be the weakest points I can talk about. Something about this game doesn't run on most computers without freezeframing every so often, especially when you're trying to approach a corner to use for cover without overshooting it and getting shot to death out in the open. 'Screenshot time' happens to me frequently and it's just plain frustrating. Many players that chat a lot tend to be about as smart as a sack of hammers. They rant accusations of cheating at any who best them and can't spell or put together an intelligible sentence.  It's free to play so give it a shot. The shooting will take some getting used to and you might have to put up with fighting against players who have guns and mods that synergise to produce a just plain better weapon that new players need to earn through some amount of playing.
4664	1	a	Its a game of anger
4666	1	a	it is good game . I can say it is only game with have police mod on it but it is full of lag i have 1Gb internet but i have lag on it my system is not bad too   AMD Athlon(tm) II X2 260 Processor 3.2 GHz  RAM 4.00 GB ATI Radeon HD 5450 512mb win 7 pro
4668	1	a	this game is ok but it is cainda lagi il giv it a 8/10 
4670	1	a	A very common place to be if your looking for a little griefing here and therem but its great game all around. It has that GTA feeling to it, but its own online multiplayer system. Sweet game to get into for free!
4672	1	a	I've played this game far more than my Steam profile suggests. If you're looking for an MMO Third-Person shooter, this is the game to get. The ability to customize in this game is the best I've seen out of any video game I've ever played, and there are multiple stories to be told on both sides, if you're interested.  The downside? Purely PVP based. If you like the other features, know that you'll have to PVP to get everything you want out of them. But hey, for many, that's not all that bad.
4674	1	a	this game is all fik tup 
4676	1	a	This is the best free game ive ever played. ENJOY! PAY TO WIN!
4678	1	a	if you didnt have to veryfy email
4680	1	a	Can't really recommend the main part of this game, city centered objective based gameplay, but the weapons are halfway decently balanced making the team death match ('fight club') pretty fun if you like running around shooting things. Learning curve is pretty steep for new players, it takes a while to learn the quirks of the game.
4682	1	a	Fun game. Easy to cheat in.
4684	1	a	You run around as a criminal or a vigilante and shoot one the oppsite people while completing objectives. Can be a bit frustrating to play with randoms, really fun with friends. VERY high skillcap. Go give it a go.  8/10
4686	1	a	Its a fun game, however they need to fix the driving.
4688	1	a	This game is a very fun but very violent game there might be trolls but not a bunch its simply fantastic and more people should play this than they do
4690	1	a	after much playing the game i have to say its great. unlike many free to play its not exactly pay to win. there are micro transactions and things like premium but u can get around those. u play against other premium or non premiums and u wont notice. at the begining its tedious, u get killed alot and will feel awfull but its actually just skill. i havent encountered any actual hackers just realy good players. my advice is to get a friend or make some online and enjoy this free to play master piece
4692	1	a	One of the coolest open word game ever made to be played for free! Awesome hd ,tons of explosions,gunfight,and hell a lot more!
4694	1	a	This game should not be fun. It's driving is feels remarkably disconnected and can give you the sensation of simultaneously driving on tar and ice at the same time. Shooting is okay but uninspired, gun fights rarely feel that exciting as it usually just boils down to strafe and shoot. Maps are too small and too few buildings are enterable. The pool of missions that you have to chose from is also very small and most are boring.  Despite all this, though, every so often this game just grabs you by the balls and takes you for a fun as hell ride. These are usually down to escort or defend missions that have a fair number of players with you. When you're in a car chase with ten other people, suddenly the unresponsive steering and the wonky physics feel more like boons. Once I was escorting one of my fellow criminals down one of the main roads (he was in an armored car and I was in a stolen ambulance) and we were ambushed by a group of enforcers, what was once a simple mission turned into a demolition derby. Chaos reigned. It's moments like those that you play a game like this and you really start to hold it in higher regard than it should be.
4696	1	a	I loved the character creation!
4698	1	a	a great take on the sandbox genre. everything from yourself to your car is highly custimizable. always enough to keep you busy!
4700	1	a	Great game, that have amazing customizability and also great objective based gameplay that favors teamplay and tactics. Can be tough for new players to get in to. Map knowledge and mastering of movement and aiming takes time. Naturally skilled TPS players will come in with fairly good chances though.  There is no game similiar to it (GTA 5 is not the same). if the following three things fits you, you should try it:  - Open world combat for objectives is attractive for you - Fairly big focus on your character and weapon setup is fun to you. - You enjoy playing and relaying on other people to archieve succes. Preferably in a clan.
4702	1	a	&lt;- when playing this game
4704	1	a	It's a good alternative to GTAV. Maybe better.
4706	1	a	MVP in my white tee, playing for free on a killing spree.  
4708	1	a	Got into the game and it instantly crashed. After an hour of setting it up, creating accts galore, it crashes. I got back in and played around a little bit. Not much to entertain me though.
4710	1	a	sweet game for free
4712	1	a	awesome free to play game 
4714	1	a	It's good dumb fun. The matchmaking tries its hardest to put you against people your skill level, so don't fret if you're terrible, you'll be put against those who are as well. :)  It's a decent game, I'd suggest it to those who want to goof around and customize their character to all hell.  Wish it had a decent roleplay community, sadly.. no.
4716	1	a	was ver good felt lik an proper gangstor wit many gun for to chosen from. is excitig graphicals and fun driving of the vehicules
4718	1	a	I AM THE VILLAGER I RECOMEND THIS GAME!
4720	1	a	One of the sickest games i ever played! Keep on!
4722	1	a	i have played it and i have to say it is one of the best gta clones evar
4724	1	a	This game has the ability to ♥♥♥♥ you off horridly. But then suddenly you stop getting team killed, and stop dealing with aim bots, and it's literally the best F2p shooter MMO out right now. Great system, i have NEVER seen such an awesome customization system before, you can make anyhting you like if you have the skill to do it design wise. Totally worth a try or two.
4726	1	a	lot of fun great for groups
4728	1	a	fun......................as.......................................hell 
4730	1	a	I broke into a garage, shot innocent people while running down the street, ran from the cops, and then fell off a building and lost everything. Also I did all this in my underwear.  10/10
4732	1	a	Highly detailed character creator. Go to advanced and play around - possibilities are almost endless.  GTA-like gameplay, improved by competitiveness (your mission is opposed by members of the other faction). The pay for better items (which are ridiculously expensive with in-game currency) will leave you at teh mercy of others as a froob though (free playing noob).
4734	1	a	Awsome game, Very fun to get ur own Customized Clothing and Cars
4736	1	a	spawned in with like 3 friends, some guy named RIPINPEACE comes up with a gun   and so on and so on
4738	1	a	why?
4740	1	a	armas marketplace
4742	1	a	this game is awsome
4744	1	a	this game sucks , not even a 4GB computer can play this game, only rich people can play this game , dont waste your time installing , it needs a biger GB , biger than 4GB
4746	1	a	Great co-op Grand Theft Auto. But bloody hardware requirements... :(
4748	1	a	go game laggy tho 
4750	1	a	Great game
4752	1	a	Reminds me alot of Gta but this is online its one huge open world city online where you have to do missions while being either bad guy or a cop then go have fun
4754	1	a	Hatred Is Your New Ally....
4756	1	a	very nice game =D
4758	1	a	Really nice game!
4760	1	a	This is a game where you really do need friends to enjoy. Solo, it's an abysmal experience, stuck with people who don't know what they're doing or don't care. In a group of friends, good (And sometimes not good) competition drives the fun home. I have never had as many purely frustrating moments followed by exhileration and vice versa as I have this game. Give it a try, but take friends with you.
4762	1	a	Asta La Vista, Babe.  Shoot to kill, shoot to thrill.  -AC/DC
4764	1	a	I honestly have no idea why I've played this game for 100 hours.
4766	1	a	beautiful if you have the computer to run it other than that fun and a blast.
4768	1	a	I &lt;3 This G ame So much!! So much fun kind of like GTA V
4770	1	a	this is the best game of all time GET IT NOW YOU WONT REGRET IT, ITS AWSOME
4772	1	a	Amazing Game Lots of fun :)
4774	1	a	Enforcer Anaiyah approves. (thumbs up) get this game. Do it. Do it now. lol right now!
4776	1	a	i love it its free GTA
4778	1	a	Really addictive high octane 3rd person shooter reloaded with adrenaline shots on every single mission. Huge cities, nice environment, pimped cars, cool music, extreme customization options, tactical missions, good people, good fights. Almost ruined my life!* 10/10 &lt;3         YouTube™ Video:  APB Reloaded Live Action Trailer HD&nbsp;
4780	1	a	Great customization options, plus a good PvP. Love how the missions work too.
4782	1	a	Incredibly fun GTA style mmo.
4784	1	a	This game has a high learning curve that is compounded with a very brief tutorial. HOWEVER, if you can push through that... handle the PC requirmernts, then just look up stuff you don't know online or ask people in game and you'll be fine. I'm about 80 hours in and still learning small things.   If you love a cops and robbers style game that combines tactics and leveling then this game is for you. Makes some in game friends and it's a blast. Remember that it's a free game and if you want, you could always drop a few bucks on a pay gun that fits your playstyle in the market place.
4786	1	a	It's a good alternative to GTAV. Maybe better.
4788	1	a	MVP in my white tee, playing for free on a killing spree.  
4790	1	a	Got into the game and it instantly crashed. After an hour of setting it up, creating accts galore, it crashes. I got back in and played around a little bit. Not much to entertain me though.
4792	1	a	I reccomend this game purely because its just GTA but online. There is a lot to do and you can choose to be a cop or a vigilante. Either way, its surprises you.
4794	1	a	Damm good game 51 hours of play 2 characters. This game is pure epicness definatly get it
4796	1	a	grat gam . gud storyline, it is an rpg game to. if you like racing game, it has gocarts. i lik to rid in the boats to. i steer into othr boat. fun vry fun
4798	1	a	its pretty sweet 
4800	1	a	good game multiplayer is epic and you can make your own cloths realy nice game if i was you play dis game
4802	1	a	yes its amzing
4804	1	a	As you can see, i am an Argonian, And i require a certain... Type of game, And this game is perfect for me and my reptilian Brethren 10/10 Would Play Again
4806	1	a	Funnest game i have ever played in my life! 
4808	1	a	I love this game cuz ist very good and fun to play alone or with your friends
4810	1	a	THIS GAME IS AWESOME   ESPECIALLY IF U R IN A CLAN  +REP
4812	1	a	Awesome game with hours of gameplay!
4814	1	a	It's a really bad game that I happen to like.
4816	1	a	Don't feel like getting Saints Row the Third or GTAV? You will feel right at home with this type of chaotic madness gameplay. The game is alot of fun running around doing missions that take teamwork. But this free to play does suffer game crashes for now until it gets fixed in the future. 8/10
4818	1	a	This game is like a really bad cigarette; Really expensive and you know it's terrible but it is so addicting you just can't stop. Playing with friends I recommend, don't expect it to be easy either. Raging will be involved, but it only makes you want to get better.
4820	1	a	If you wanna get your blood pressure high... Play this game!!!
4822	1	a	Awesome. The perfect GTA style shooter
4824	1	a	I love this game accept i know people who have macs and they want to play... So maybe you should make a mac version!
4826	1	a	6/10  Full of annoying bugs, which will irritate you and prevent you from enjoying a full experience of gameplay. The general idea of the game isn't bad, but it's only a'try only once' kind of game.
4828	1	a	I like this game. All my friends don't, but only for silly reasons. First off, I'm very fond of Open World games, and this has a very nice GTA feel to it. The driving is a little loose, but walking/running around is a lot more fun than driving IMHO. The only negative thing I can say about this game, is that sometimes it makes you scream 'GOD DAMN PAY TO WINS!' During missions, people on the other team just have better guns, that you can't get without spending a little real world cash. That being said, its still a fun game, and I totally recommend!
4830	1	a	Closest game to gta I have ever had   9 out of 10
4832	1	a	THIS GAME IS: 10% LUCK 20% SKILL 15% CONCENTRATED POWER OF WILL 5% PLEASURE 50% PAIN  AND 100% REASON TO PURCHASE THE GAME.
4834	1	a	just get it its free and its pretty much a gta/saints row, MMO
4836	1	a	If you’re looking for your first job in games, it’s worth thinking very carefully about your future employer. Do you want to work on jaded, derivative titles that receive scathing reviews and go straight to the bargain bin? Do you want to work large amounts of unpaid overtime because your project is underfunded and poorly managed? Do you want to work on codebases that are messy and poorly-designed because there’s never time to do things properly? Do you want to live in fear of your company’s financial security?  It’s sad that these and other games industry horror stories are more frequent than they should be, but it’s not like that here. We only work on original, ambitious projects: our first title, Crackdown, was a number-one hit, winning critical acclaim and multiple awards, and our best is yet to come, beginning with our first online game, APB.
4838	1	a	The game is f*cking awesome ! 10/10
4840	1	a	This takes forever!!! 
4842	1	a	Pretty fun F2p crime game, great customization too, though it is a bit of a grind.
4844	1	a	...
4846	1	a	Regardless of the amount of people shouting pay to win, the game is somewhat enjoyable. The only downside for me is living in South Africa and not getting a good latency. If you looking for some gang related time to waste this is your game
4848	1	a	APB sucked but no that another company took over and made it better.
4850	1	a	its has a good driveing as well as real life and you can get cooler looking &gt;:D
4852	1	a	Amazing game, its like a free to play Grand Theft Auto
4854	1	a	awsome ame i know i spelled awesome rong but still oooowee whats with that whats up with that 
4856	1	a	OMG THIS IS SO AWSOME 
4858	1	a	Very high skillcap, huge potential for effective teamplay and the most balanced game I've come across in forever. Obviously every mission can't be perfect, but as far as I know.. this is as good as it gets. :P Also: incredible customization in this game. Without a doubt the deepest customization suite I've come across.
4860	1	a	This game is difficult to get into but with the customization options that are vast, the game has many things to keep you playing. I wouldn't recomend it to anyone, it is too addictive if you get started properly and the community sucks buuuuuut, the game is pretty good just because of the customization...
4862	1	a	not bad it is fun butt the it gets repetative but it is good 
4864	1	a	It's getting more refined and balanced... Zap
4866	1	a	i love this game
4868	1	a	APB Reloaded is an okayish game.  What's good-  ~Character/Car/Weapon customization  ~Nice large maps (2 regular) (3 Event) (1 Social room)  ~Interesting gameplay, though I'd suggest playing with a friend  ~Able to loot stores and bring cars to chop shops for cash  ~Okayish gamemods  What's bad~  ~Weapons are STILL unblanced.  ~Pay2Win may be an option, but it's the 'Suggested Path'. Those who say APB Reloaded isn't a Pay2Win game, I agree. BUT! It's arugable. There are plenty of people that can't afford or aren't interested in purchasing the Premium that wipe the floor with those who are Premium  ~Babymen are in a large amount in this game. You kill someone with said rifle it's either 'OMG Hacker!' or they whisper you and type 'Wow ur using 'Blah blah'? u don't have skill fagot lel'   ~Teamwork seems to be missing in this game. At least for the criminal side. Those who play Enforcers seem to use their mics, and get along with each other 'Slightly' and can play a match without typing in team chat 'YOU MOTHER F*CKERS SUCK OMG NOOBS UNINSTALL THE GAME'    
4870	1	a	If gta and Saints row had a free to play baby
4872	1	a	This game so good
4874	1	a	APB Reloaded challenges players into wild streets of San Paro. Brings them into a hard fight between the good and evil...The question is which one of the two forces are good or evil? But at all APB Reloaded can be a great game for people who want to personalize and customize EVERYTHING they have. My score to APB is 10/10
4876	1	a	APB Reloaded is a great game if you are into that kind of mission type, open world crime games. As great as it looks, it also has those good immersive team co-op type missions as well. Along with:  Graphics: 9.5/10 I have seen better, but it is a great game for this section. I would have to turn it down a few notches but it still looks fine.  Sound: 10/10 Ahhh... the San Paro ambiant sounds. The citizens are screaming, the distant rivalry gunshots are whizzing past me. How better can it be? Well, it would be better if I still had my ear. I take that back. I hate the gunshots. Darn that city.  Gameplay: 7/10 The gameplay is really based on the latency, which also depends which district you are on. But generally, it's kinda bad. I mean, assuming you have obsticals, The fences seem like you are basically superman, flying over them like they're nothing. Plus we got the ladders. Going up, sometimes you won't reach the top. Sometimes you'll fall right off. Also, Going down, you'll lose stamina if you decide to be lazy, in this case, escape your enemy. And if you go around a corner, you'll still die due to that last bullet. EVEN THOUGH it MISSES YOU ENTIRELY! But hey, this is in early stages. and will get developed.  Replay value: na/na There is no end to this game.  Overall value: 8.75 I would reccomend this to people on certain circumstances. It's fun. I do like this game and would spend 3 hours or more in one session.     
4878	1	a	Its alright i think 
4880	1	a	oh i see you are better than me, HAX
4882	1	a	A fun openworld game, and the factions interact very well in the well-designed urban environments. A wide variety of customization options for your cars, character and clan keeps you individual and personal. through all a good game, quirky but good
4884	1	a	Kills time well.
4886	1	a	Great concept outstanding customization of body,clothes,cars,designs and such. Get's boring after awhile same missions over and over, not to mention bought guns dominate the game so it's pointless to play for free if you're practically going to get kiled by anybody with a golden weapon.
4888	1	a	This game has huge, huge upsides but also huge, huge downsides. It lags like ♥♥♥♥ on the lowest settings and has sub-par gun play, but the customization is amazingly detailed. It makes Skyrim's character creator look like ANIMAL CROSSING'S CHARACTER CREATION. Besides, this game's still in beta no matter what they say. Killing civilians isn't even considered a crime as far as what Player Character cops can do about it. The thing that sets APB apart from other MMOs is the fact that it isn't an RPG. There are NO NPC's other than civilians and salesmen. That means no ♥♥♥♥ing grinding. Whether or not you like this game, you have to admit it is unique among MMOs and games in general.
4890	1	a	Certainly at its best when playing with a group of friends. Sure the game might try to reason with you to spend money on the game (Decals limits, exclusive items, powerful weapons, increased EXP rate) and have bad community where in my case, people swearing left and right and accusing of hacks. It has bugs but if you're with someone you call as a friend it's easy to let those errors slip aside. If you have someone playing the game, give it a try. If not, well you can try and make friends over there.
4892	1	a	terrible with lag
4894	1	a	If you're just starting this game, once you reach Silver I recommend you do not go on Silver districts. Go on Bronze districts otherwise you're going to get destroyed by all the Golds on the Silver districts.  This game is not pay to win no matter how many people who tell you that, it really isn't. Basically every gun can be countered and most guns that you can access using G1C (Paid Currency) are just reskins of the normal guns that you can unlock within an hour or so of playing.  I also recommend you use all the free redeem codes that are floating around somewhere in a guide on the Steam community. You'll get free Premium and stuff.  If you don't like it within the first 15 hours of gameplay, you won't like it ever.
4896	1	a	10 out of 10
4898	1	a	Great game, would definately recommend to anyone who enjoys a bit of teamplay here and there. There are some hackers too so be aware of that but i definitely reccomend to any GTA fan.
4900	1	a	This is the best Massively Multiplayer Open World game i ever played :D :D
4902	1	a	Best third person multiplayer shooter. Sprawling cities, cars (best physics), guns, and customization galore.
4904	1	a	A REALLY FUN GAME! But for all the new players, beware... Theres those ♥♥♥♥♥♥ that will ruin your fun, but just bare with it!
4906	1	a	Highly recommend if you like GTA and dont want to pay the price!
4908	1	a	This is a fun multiplayer third person shooter, it has a lot of customizaiton and is very addictive. If you enjoy GTA or games similar to that this is a must have, and best of all its free.
4910	1	a	Very fun to play with friends or without friends. Either way, it's solid. Being a good change to other MMOs. The game looks amazing and even with minium settings. 8/10 stars.
4912	1	a	So I began this game as a noob. I think everyone does. It takes some work to figure out the way APB works, which strategy works best. It's all about finding the right car and the right weapons that you play best with. The graphics could be better, but the game has its personality design through the graphics it already has, so I think it fits. Maxing the character out takes quite some time, but that's not required in being the best. Perks don't make a huge difference if you adapt better without perks. There are plenty of choices once enough work has been put into the APB Reloaded. Watch out for players that maxed out and start a new character, you might make haccusations.
4914	1	a	pay to win
4916	1	a	I LOVE THIS GAME ITS THE BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4918	1	a	cool game austin should get it
4920	1	a	I think it is fun, and how you can customise most of the stuff is just awesome (in my opinoin) :D
4922	1	a	As with most of the money kidnapping game...But the time to push for. X)
4924	1	a	Worth playing, me and my friends Mike and Tristan play this all the time, a fun multiplayer shooter
4926	1	a	This game has addictable gamplay but also it's poorly optimized ( Laggs,fps problems)
4928	1	a	great you need an awesome computer though!
4930	1	a	If you would like to kill some time, this might be one of the top free2play games out there. However by F2P you should know that the game dominate by those who spend cash on it. Which isn't cheap etheir. You can easily waste 20-30 dollars on weapons and other features.  I still recommend this for those who have not yet tried it. Tyvm..
4932	1	a	is pretty fun for a free game that you can play with your friend but i dont recomend using real life money in the game its not worth thats is just my oppinon
4934	1	a	it is an awesome third person action packed shooter with explosions,gunfights,robberies, and much, much more! It does take a bit of a large file size BUT, you can reduce major lag by following some of the guides :P
4936	1	a	It's okay. The only problem is that it is pay to win :\
4938	1	a	This is an overall great game with all its fun.
4940	1	a	i think that APB Reloaded was suggested by tearmanator152 which was a perfect game just like Grand Theft Auto's
4942	1	a	great game 100,000,000,000,000 times better than all the gta games download it you will not regret
4944	1	a	like gta with mmo games 
4946	1	a	YES I DO LIKE
4948	1	a	fun casual game. Has its faults. Good for the GTA addict. not as bad as critics make it out to be.
4950	1	a	Great 3rd person shooter.
4952	1	a	my ram are 2 gb but i play it normally with some lags of course but what does out of memore mean ? when i play it for a while it crash then give me a error called out of memory can someone help me with that
4954	1	a	Awesome customization game, worth the try
4956	1	a	I find it pretty addictive even at the start, got bored of the steam games I play until I found this! It will enlight your boredom. Download APB Reloaded! For free on Steam! :D
4958	1	a	really cool game  
4960	1	a	Its only good to hack in, dont waste your G1C because they will ban you for no reason anyways. infact dont waste your time and internet downloading this peice of ♥♥♥♥.
4962	1	a	I start know i will see how will going
4964	1	a	The game will not let me login through steam nor will it allow me to choose the resolution of my monitor as 1280x1024 is not listed and all other resolutions result in a distorted image or an 'unsupported' error from my moniter.  On a side note though, while rooting through the games files to try to set a custom resolution by editing config files I discovered files like: 'LinuxEngine.ini' and 'LinuxEngine-PS3Paths.ini' suggesting that a Linux and/or PS3 version (as the PS3 OS is based of FreeBSD) is in the works.
4966	1	a	What could be better you can drive cars, shoot pedestrians, and robs stores! And for the people who say this is a bad game try playing it now!
4968	1	a	300mb patch, 5+hours to download 10/10
4970	1	a	Well the game has lag and a lot but when you manage to not have lag is a decent ad fun game specially for playing with friends!!
4972	1	a	Although it crashes on me a lot, I don't think I've found a third person shooter yet with so much custimazation and variety. Highly reccomended, if only to try once. Some of the weapons available from real money as opposed to in game currency unbalance some aspects of it, but not to a game breaking degree. Try it out, but don't drop any money unless you're serious about playing it.
4974	1	a	Pretty good game! I know maybe the creators will hate me for this but it is like GTA in it's freedom (and that is a good thing in my book) I've played other Crime games like Crime Craft but none really appealed to me like this one. I like the open world 'do anything you want' feel it has similar to GTA. What I really like though is the random bounties and 'capture' or 'guard' etc. missions in addition to the regular missions. The fact that you can not only pick one side of the law or the other, but just how notoruis you want to be. I've been mugging all kinds of people! Lol. Graphics are great, sound is excellent and the controls are smooth. All around it is quite a good effort and works well.
4976	1	a	very addictive game 10/10
4978	1	a	This Game is pretty awesome. I used to play Grand Theft Auto Series when I was 7 years old . I also visited the Facebook Page of this game and I'm Shocked because the The Creator of this Game is also the one who created GTA ,thats cool but the graphics aren't good enough. I also wanted them to put some Interiors also alot of Props in the Street to make this game more Awesomer
4980	1	a	Apb is a fun game when play in a good group or with good players
4982	1	a	Oh Look at tat body Oh Look at tat body !
4984	1	a	this game is so cool 
4986	1	a	this game is the crossed magnums and the crossed shotguns
4988	1	a	APB is an awesome Cops and Robbers game pitting player against player in a fight to control the city. The high customization, as well as the firefights and car chases ensure this game will be high on your favorite games list. 8.5/10
4990	1	a	Nice game, awesome graphics considering the game is free. Would recommend.
4992	1	a	The features themselves could be a little more fleshed out but with a few friends this game can be a blast. I'd recommend it to anyone who has people they can play with.  On top of that though the level of character customization is INSANE, couldn't ask for a better system.
4994	1	a	Where do I even start with is game. you got guns. you got hip hop. and you got customization like you wouldnt even ♥♥♥♥ing think possible. this game is the ♥♥♥♥. you even wanna roll 4 deep with some homies and just shoot up ♥♥♥♥? well in this game you can. need I say more?
4996	1	a	This game is incredible! Comparing it with GTA online, it's a peice of poop. Why?  Charactor creation! You wanna have your character musclar, well OK! You wanna customize your hair style! No problemo. There's so much options for your character! Change cloths, customizing cloths,...etc  Vehicle customizing! Put at least 25+ decals for your car! Even a starter car can be majestic if you know how to! You can also DESIGNER your decals and vinyls with the designer!   Awesome weapons! You can mod the weapon too!   Good friend systems!   There's also some bad things: The match making system. Sometimes you are a newcomer and then you have to face P2Ws. There is a small amount of hackers.  You don't get to change and buy cars right in a mission district. You have to go to the social district in order to do that. I know there are some poopy PCs and it takes 10 minutes to go from a district to another.   The vehicles have too big limits. There aren't boats, helis and jets and tanks. I want it to be in there.  We all want to set our own bounties. I don't like how I have to get killz until I get to notoriety 5 (and that's nearly impossible xD). I want to be able to set my own bounties and the amount of money you get out of a bounty is too small. We definitly want to set 20k bounties.  SUMMARY  Pros: Awesome customizing systems Weapon modding Friend system!  Cons Too much P2W. The worst match making system. Limited vehicles Non-setable bounties.  -----&gt; Game score: 7.1 GOOD
4998	1	a	Spent three hours making a sticker 18/10
5000	1	a	seems like gta but better because i guess there are trailers.
5002	1	a	If only
5004	1	a	A Good fun game , It's much better with friends, The only thing i can complain about is the fact that you can only buy weapons that run out after 10 days, Or you can pay real money or farm for 1-2 months to earn one, If you go to buy one with money the cheapest for a character is 28 euro. (Perm for that char)
5006	1	a	overall i think this game is pretty good if the publishers could make an update were the lagging is decreased i could play this game all day
5008	1	a	it was tough for me at first but then i got pretty good after some practice
5010	1	a	This is a good Grand Theft Auto alternative, and it is free2play too.
5012	1	a	Simply amazing, A full on 24/7 cops and robbers: Plenty of interesting missions, Ramming into storefront windows and stealing their stuff, mugging people and stealing their stuff, Even going around tagging places with your own symbols! I give it a 9.5/10 only because the community has a lot of modders, hackers, and lag switches.
5014	1	a	its super cool!!!
5016	1	a	lot's of emo's   and the driving can lag, bad,  either way, it's pay-to-win   have at it.
5018	1	a	Great Game!
5020	1	a	This game has huge, huge upsides but also huge, huge downsides. It lags like ♥♥♥♥ on the lowest settings and has sub-par gun play, but the customization is amazingly detailed. It makes Skyrim's character creator look like ANIMAL CROSSING'S CHARACTER CREATION. Besides, this game's still in beta no matter what they say. Killing civilians isn't even considered a crime as far as what Player Character cops can do about it. The thing that sets APB apart from other MMOs is the fact that it isn't an RPG. There are NO NPC's other than civilians and salesmen. That means no ♥♥♥♥ing grinding. Whether or not you like this game, you have to admit it is unique among MMOs and games in general.
5022	1	a	Basically a massive online game of cops and robbers. Set in a GTA style city, players form groups or wander about solo until they are assigned a mission by one of the npc informants. At any point in the mission, players form the opposing faction will be recruited to stop them. The learning curve is very steep and the game doesn't do a good job of explaining what you can and should be doing. You will die alot at first. If you can get into a good group, or get together with some friends, this game can be a blast. It also has an incredibly robust customization feature for everything from clothes to cars to your own theme song. This game is quite good for a free to play title, and you don't have to spend money to be good at it. It is definitely worth checking out if you're interested.
5024	1	a	.
5026	1	a	Awesome game. Period.
5028	1	a	Amazing 3D open world multiplayer game. Buy guns and own the world. Fun to play with friends.
5030	1	a	I love playing this game every time I play I feel like I should go out to the shops and buy a AK-47 and shoot everybody around me lol -_-
5032	1	a	I love everything about this game :)
5034	1	a	Fun to play with friends, especially if you coordinate with them.
5036	1	a	Fun but very raging! XD 
5038	1	a	This has to be the most fun open world game I've played from steam yet. The graphics in this game are great and vehicles are good, but driving is fun. However, the character customisation would need some adjusting. Other than that, a fun game to play and I reccomend this to other steam players
5040	1	a	Stands for Action Police Brain.
5042	1	a	Been playing this game off and on since RTW (Original publisher) and I must say this game is soooooooo fun.....silly crazy nutty chaos!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It is free.....no obligation to purchase Armas gear and there are many events in which to get account items. Add in the new refer a friend program and you are able to get a VERY nice account in APB.
5044	1	a	APB is my favorite game, coming with a high amount of character and car customization and still be F2P. It is a bit hard to get into, as you'll need to immediately face off against other players, although it tries to have you fight against more or less equally matched players. There are quite a few traps to fall into when you are new, so i'd suggest asking someone more experienced for advice.  The dev teams does put some effort into the game to make changes, they are having quite a bit of trouble. The company which developed APB coded it rather awkwardly, using a semi-custom engine which makes developing for it even harder. On that note though, the devs are trying to update the engine to a newer version, which should allow them to make better patches, although i'm not expecting too much. In all i'd say it's worth a look, though you should ask some more experienced people for advise and play with friends instead of alone, especially at the beginning.
5046	1	a	When I first downloaded this game I jumped straight into it and have played it for 62 hours in total, it has its ups and downs. But also holds a great downside which is where newbies are being put up against veterans/experienced players. This could be fixed by adding 3 servers, one for low levelled players, one for higher levelled players and another one for mixed players where low levelled players can still go up against higher levelled players, this would be good because you could have a friend who is a much higher level than you when you're only level 1, you can just jump straight into the mixed server and join him/her
5048	1	a	this is one of the best games
5050	1	a	it's a toned down version of GTA. o hookers, trippers or nudity. Only fun multiplayer free roam. Like an even more toned down Saints Row2.
5052	1	a	Had to use proxy AGAIN to bypass this stupid 'not available' nonsense... The question is: why Free to Play game is not available - I HAVE NO IDEA... Btw, gonna be back at friday during weekend... Busy week before christmas and i'm also changing my life aspects.
5054	1	a	This game is pure genius. The whole idea to make a game that revolves around the crime life making two classes fihgting against each other is brilliant. The customisation and the style it brings is amazing. It is a whole new world. All the little details are great. This game is incredible.The best thing about it is that it's avalaible for everyone freely. The one down side to it is that people with not so good stats on their pc can't enjoy it because of the high graphics. To some people even the lowest graphics are still a problem to the gameplay. But this game is still incredible and I strongly reccomend it.
5056	1	a	This game isso much FUN! 
5058	1	a	lolwut dolan pls! 6 gb ram and fine.
5060	1	a	this game is great. Its like an online GTA. Its free aswell so its even better. Play as cop or criminal and roam the streets doing missions and killing eachother
5062	1	a	The best game :D
5064	1	a	The game is realy cool but not everybody have the graphic you need a strong computer but it s realy cool
5066	1	a	Great Game. FUN! It'd be better if everything was free and you didn't have to rack up the in-game coins to get stuff but,eh I guess We should rob banks lol.
5068	1	a	its awesome and epic but it has flaws 1.error code 8 2.it does not work when i want it to thats all i could think of.
5070	1	a	Alot of people call this game pay to win, in a way it is but only if you want stronger weapons. The weapons arent to much stronger but do give you a slight edge. But as long as you have skill your can still overcome and win all the same.
5072	1	a	APB reloded happend to be in my personal favorite Top 5 F2P genre. The Game takes time and is all around fun for enforcers and criminals. However the guns you purchase expire after a few days and primium players have a advantage right away with guns, cars and xp/money bonus. Also there is a strange shot system for example there are NO headshots in the game and if you shoot someone in the toe with a sniper rifle it counts as a kill. Real average and lacks logic   7.75/10
5074	1	a	Game makes me rage hard. So many hurr durr things are wrong with. I still recommend it tho Its fun with friends.
5076	1	a	fun and addicting
5078	1	a	For me the game worked fine but I couldn't play long enough to actually play. Short story down to one sentence, Punkbuster is a ♥♥♥♥ and kicked me for not having something I have no idea what it is or how to get it. From What I saw, it's a combination of serious Saints Row and WoW. Maybe I'll be able to play it but for now, ♥♥♥♥ you Punkbuster.
5080	1	a	APB IS ♥♥♥♥ TO MUTCH OF A PAY 2 WIN GAME GAME CREATORS NERF THE GAME!
5082	1	a	It's a good game, save that I dislike the rent-a-gun weaponry system
5084	1	a	looks like a really, really good game but won't work for me right now on my computer :(
5086	1	a	Awsome game! sadly its not an FPS game its based on third person camera. its almost like grand theft auto but whithout the language. all in all great game would recommend to anyone.
5088	1	a	I like this a lot but i lag so much:( can anyone try to help me??
5090	1	a	This game is a pretty good Free-To-Play game. If anyone want to play a GTA like game thats free this is it. However the game has more cons than pros. The mission system is unfair as it match veterans to new comers which ruin the first time experience. The missions also get boring after a while when you notice you are basicly doing the same thing over and over with no story. AI are fun to mess around but they get boring over time. They say the same thing over and over, not alot of reactions. Some of the enviorment ruins the sandbox action also. How there is little interaction with the enviorment. Kicking doors and climbing small fences is really the only thing you can do. Need more interacts like when theres a wall thats not too high u can climb on it. The car control is very chaotic and is hard to tame comapred to GTA. The game still offers alot of good content despite all of this. Theres is a large amount of unlocks, weapons and vehicles. There are tons of custimization to choose from and you can even import your own music. The game has much potential and I look forward to see what else the developers got for this game. With that being said my final Verdict is a 7/10
5092	1	a	aggressive, frustrating and an awesome experience for those who love the GTA games
5094	1	a	Fun game but when it comes to specs this things just loves to hog your computers power. It really needs to be optimized more and always have lag issues. That being said, it is a fun game espically if your a robber.
5096	1	a	great art work, fun sound, well done customization
5098	1	a	OMG THIS IS SO AWSOME 
5100	1	a	Really good game having fun with it so much i recommend to u ;) try it out.
5102	1	a	It's got OP grenade's, what more could you want?
5104	1	a	great game
5106	1	a	... Pay to the win.  
5108	1	a	pros: It's a great game, it's a mix between GTA and Saints Row. Cons: there will be hackers at least 2 a month, physics are bad, graphics could be updated.
5110	1	a	I started playing APB whenever I got bored of World of Warcraft and enjoy coming back to it time to time. It's fun to customize characters and have all out wars between criminals and enforcers.
5112	1	a	So I began this game as a noob. I think everyone does. It takes some work to figure out the way APB works, which strategy works best. It's all about finding the right car and the right weapons that you play best with. The graphics could be better, but the game has its personality design through the graphics it already has, so I think it fits. Maxing the character out takes quite some time, but that's not required in being the best. Perks don't make a huge difference if you adapt better without perks. There are plenty of choices once enough work has been put into the APB Reloaded. Watch out for players that maxed out and start a new character, you might make haccusations.
5114	1	a	Fun game to PLay as Cops and Robbers
5116	1	a	This is like gta4 cops and robbers mode excpet you get to actually break into houses and customize your character
5118	1	a	Recommended
5120	1	a	♥♥♥♥ with this game, free to play, and cool
5122	1	a	Try this if you allready haven't!!! :D
5124	1	a	pritty fun game reminds me of gta 5
5126	1	a	Good game but full of cheeters... :(  is good to play...
5128	1	a	Best free-to-play game on Steam!
5130	1	a	I Totaly Recommend This Game Its Hard To Get Used To At First But Then Its Easy And Alot Of Fun Its Like A GTA mmo! Fun With Friends!
5132	1	a	Best Free to Play Game Ever !!! Awesome Graphics !!! Awesome Fun !!!
5134	1	a	cool 
5136	1	a	great game
5138	1	a	Insane open-world multiplayer
5140	1	a	This game is severly underrated. Within my first few hours of playing, I found a group of players to accompany on missions and had a blast. I run the game on medium specs and opted for a smooth framerate. Visually, the game favors my needs of it and has played flawlessly beyond small delays for amassed action on the screen.
5142	1	a	Heavily reliant on your RAM. Synchronization is server-based rather than client based, so when you press W it takes an extra half second for you to move forward. Once you get used to the slight lag, it's a wicked good game dude.
5144	1	a	Its free. Nuff said
5146	1	a	Pretty, sweet. I don't reccomend it for low end computers though, so as long as you system requirements you should be good!
5148	1	a	Extremely underrated, APB: Reloaded is easily my favorite F2P game.... if only for the customization. I'd say easily 25% of my time has been spent creating things in one of the many editors. No other game out there offers the level of nuanced customization that APB offers.   I'd highly recommend this game for anyone who like shooters and cars. The learning curve can be a bit steep, and sometimes the population is a little wack, but overall I usually find this an enjoyable game.
5150	1	a	Yes I recommend this because of the great graphics and how you can customize your character
5152	1	a	OMG GET THIS GAME BE CRIMINAL AND DO STUFF! ITS SOOOOOO AWESOME
5154	1	a	apb is a cool game that should get more publicity=) 
5156	1	a	Awesome but kinda sucks cause micro-transactions are needed to be actually good
5158	1	a	Simply amazing, A full on 24/7 cops and robbers: Plenty of interesting missions, Ramming into storefront windows and stealing their stuff, mugging people and stealing their stuff, Even going around tagging places with your own symbols! I give it a 9.5/10 only because the community has a lot of modders, hackers, and lag switches.
5160	1	a	Pretty darn fun, need a good PC though to really enjoy the open worldness.
5162	1	a	grat gam . gud storyline, it is an rpg game to. if you like racing game, it has gocarts. i lik to rid in the boats to. i steer into othr boat. fun vry fun
5164	1	a	Best gangster dress-up simulator I have ever played.
5166	1	a	Cool but the danm lag my god...
5168	1	a	Hipster? Want to be diffirent? Your game appearance is important to you? Don't care about repeative playing? This is your pick.
5170	1	a	HK csa come to play.!!! so cool!
5172	1	a	Its really fun to play with friends :D
5174	1	a	full of ♥♥♥♥ing hackers who cant play the game normally.
5176	1	a	Good game because no cost ;D 
5178	1	a	its kinda like gta but a bit bad (cause its free) it's really fun with friends, highly reccomend!
5180	1	a	GOOD GAME SIMULAR BIT TO GTA5
5182	1	a	It's pretty good. There's no harm in getting it, so if you're curious try it out.  However, be wary of snipers.
5184	1	a	cool ! :D
5186	1	a	lots of fun, pure chaos, rather unpredicatble mission-to-mission... give it a try! its F2P afterall...
5188	1	a	ive herad that many people have made a lets play and said that it was like gta exept for pc
5190	1	a	love this game but wish you could cheaply buy from the market place some gud wepons that would make the game a whole lot better but as i said i love the game and would recommend it to all oh and please add pistol007 thanks :)
5192	1	a	The joys of Mugging.
5194	1	a	Not best but could play when bored
5196	1	a	Great game. Very chaotic. Feels like a bit of a cash grab at times but its not pay to win. Great for a laugh. Lots more players on the US servers as to be expected. Will run into a hacker now and then but meh...they are everywhere.
5198	1	a	The best crime warfare !!! Weapons and outfits are no limits. Open-world and cool online missions can replace GTA V! { Just only my opinion. Sorry if you're GTA fan }
5200	1	a	EDIT:: If you're playing this game just for the thug life and because its free to play then ok, but if you are wanting to; 'Get it all' then this game is probably not for you.
5202	1	a	I robbed people of suitcases and drove off in my Comcast van. I enjoyed it.
5204	1	a	Very suprisingly good game. Still plenty for you to do even if you dont sub premium. It definitely benefits from the F2P idea. The only downside for me is where to buy a game time code, because of the fact that i tend to play this in stints when friends are one, and i just cant justify subbing completely.  Still a good F2P MMO none the less. The mission system between the enforcers and the criminals makes sense without feeling utterly ridiculous
5206	1	a	for a free game you cant really go wrong, good fun!!
5208	1	a	i have a lot of fun while playing this game it is difficult but amazing 
5210	1	a	Great Game for the cops and robbers fans i enjoy playing this from time to time
5212	1	a	Not well optimized, completely pay2win, fanbase are mostly 15 and/or morons. If that much doesn't dissuade you, it is kind of fun, and the overall presentation is fairly well done. Not a perfect game by any means, and by some means not even a good one, but it is a game, which in this day and age is more than can be said for many others.
5214	1	a	Kinda frustrating. The lag it causes in the fight clubs makes it hard to win. Other than that, perfect game! Star Rating: 8.5/10
5216	1	a	APB Reloaded is a great game in my opinion but i dont think i have ever raged so damn hard in my life. This game gives me anger issues. Like REALLY. i didnt used to rage that much until i played this game, now i rage all the ♥♥♥♥ing time. Anyways. i should stay professional.  Okay, first thing first is the games story/gameplay.  APB Reloaded is a third person over the shoulder shooter, with a cops and robbers twist. this game focuses on driving, aiming, shooting, and completing objectives that are assigned in a mission. You start off picking a side. 'Enforcer' which is a cop, has more defensive mission objectives, Arrest crims, and gain approval to use 'Less then Lethal' weaponary. which makes a criminal incapacitated and can then be arrested for bonus points. The 'Criminals' On the other hand are more aggresive, kill cops, steal and loot stuff, mug, and can do something called a 'ram raid' which is when you crash into a window shop or garage and take the goods.  Okay so now you get the gist of what im saying. now lets start with the cons and pros  Lets start with APB's AI. It isnt a good one. AT ALL. it is just a walking script with a 'DONT SHOOT ME' animation when a cop/criminal comes by. And the driving AI isnt too good either. if you are infront of a car it will wait and wait until you move. making massive roadblocks.  Balance is also a huge issue when i played it. The Beginner guns The 'Star' and the 'Obeya' are okay and are usable, but compared to some of the other 'pay to play' weapons they are complete and utter ♥♥♥♥. and are not functionable in PvP combat.  Another thing is team killing is on when in missions. so dont screw around. it can cost you ALOT of respect and money.  Leveling up is a slow and boring process in this game, you level up two things... Threat level, and Contact level. You gain threat from doing good in matches and winning, you gain contact level (which is when you level up a NPC's 'respect' with you in order to recieve clothing or weaponary) by completing missions. both of these take FOREVER and arent fun  APB is the definition of a pay to play game, every weapon that you can buy with real money is better then the weapon you have now. it is advised to have a credit card in your hand at all times when playing this game.  APB's match making system is god awful. high levels are matched with low levels. making a ♥♥♥♥ match in general  Okay now that thats done. lets go with the pros.  This game has a GREAT Customisation idea. it is incredibly smooth and effiencient. you can literally make your players own texture. without a doubt the best customisation i have ever seen.  This game also has great driving. the driving is fast paced and nice to see. put that with a squad that shoots at enemys while your at the wheel makes a intense game!  The Gameplay of this game when you have a good weapon is very fast paced and gives a really good feeling when you kill someone or something. and its even better when you do a mission objective.  APB also has everyone and everything be unique. its a nice experience to see what peoples creativity have come up with. but be careful. they are alot of hitlers and ♥♥♥♥♥.  The game lets you play how you wanna play. you can level up contract levels by doing ram raids and stealing. you can earn money arresting crims when they do this too. you always need to watch your back no matter if you are a cop or criminal.  Music and soundtrack is interesting too, makes the game have a really nice feel and everything!  My final rating and grade for this game is about 6.9/10 i barely recommend this  
5218	1	a	I got killed by jumping off a 1 story building  10/10
5220	1	a	One of my all time favorite games. Too many hours have been spent playing it. Lots of customization with generic TPS combat.
5222	1	a	best game ever but no one play mission anymore
5224	1	a	Good game but I got kicked for getting 5 headshots in a row (?)  Nearly every player is a noob.
5226	1	a	make this game for mac...
5228	1	a	i cant log in to my steam account
5230	1	a	Great game 
5232	1	a	the traler luks fun and exiting cant wat to play 
5234	1	a	Fell in love the first time I ran over somebody
5236	1	a	i have real big mixed opineons with this game imm not going to lie. but heres something they need to tweak: dont make it p2w, make gold players go to gold servers (same with silver and bronze) but other than thoes 2 things its a real solid game 7/10
5238	1	a	This is the best closest thing to gta 5 for pc that there is 
5240	1	a	overall i think this game is pretty good if the publishers could make an update were the lagging is decreased i could play this game all day
5242	1	a	I drove a car, exploded, then respawned and got ran over by a dude playing mylie cyrius, i came in like a wrecking ball. 11 out of 10, would be explode again.
5244	1	a	APB Reloaded challenges players into wild streets of San Paro. Brings them into a hard fight between the good and evil...The question is which one of the two forces are good or evil? But at all APB Reloaded can be a great game for people who want to personalize and customize EVERYTHING they have. My score to APB is 10/10
5246	1	a	APB Reloaded is a great game if you are into that kind of mission type, open world crime games. As great as it looks, it also has those good immersive team co-op type missions as well. Along with:  Graphics: 9.5/10 I have seen better, but it is a great game for this section. I would have to turn it down a few notches but it still looks fine.  Sound: 10/10 Ahhh... the San Paro ambiant sounds. The citizens are screaming, the distant rivalry gunshots are whizzing past me. How better can it be? Well, it would be better if I still had my ear. I take that back. I hate the gunshots. Darn that city.  Gameplay: 7/10 The gameplay is really based on the latency, which also depends which district you are on. But generally, it's kinda bad. I mean, assuming you have obsticals, The fences seem like you are basically superman, flying over them like they're nothing. Plus we got the ladders. Going up, sometimes you won't reach the top. Sometimes you'll fall right off. Also, Going down, you'll lose stamina if you decide to be lazy, in this case, escape your enemy. And if you go around a corner, you'll still die due to that last bullet. EVEN THOUGH it MISSES YOU ENTIRELY! But hey, this is in early stages. and will get developed.  Replay value: na/na There is no end to this game.  Overall value: 8.75 I would reccomend this to people on certain circumstances. It's fun. I do like this game and would spend 3 hours or more in one session.     
5248	1	a	Its alright i think 
5250	1	a	it a good game that it
5252	1	a	A fun openworld game, and the factions interact very well in the well-designed urban environments. A wide variety of customization options for your cars, character and clan keeps you individual and personal. through all a good game, quirky but good
5254	1	a	Very fun. Didn't like it in the first time but I am now loving it.
5256	1	a	I LOVE THIS GAME. NO KIDDING. see the hours... multiply that by 5 and u have my total overall
5258	1	a	A very nice fast action shooter with a hell of a character customasation!
5260	1	a	Pros + You can do all what you want in this game. There are lots of futures. IT´s NOT Pay2Win, because you can play very well with „STAR-556 or N-TEC“ from the beginning. You can buy also every car with Ingame-Cash or Joker-Ticket. You can also buy R195 modifications for 250 Joker-Ticket.  Cons - The Game needs very high system requirements. It´s very teambased game. AND lots of cheaters and macro players. 
5262	1	a	Awesome game. Very open worlded and customizable. Definitley get it.
5264	1	a	its stupid annoying and now its not on so i cant change my acount beacaze it says its still open 
5266	1	a	Great game, awesome concept with fun missions and a somewhat impressive matchmaking system. However, this game has a problem that a lot of games with microtransitions have and that's the 'pay to win' aspect. A lot of games have it to a minor degree but this game takes it so far to the extreme that it can be unplayable if you're against someone with a real dollars purchased weapon. It's one thing to give a slight edge to those who support the game, but an entirely different thing to turn off free-to-play, potential customers, because they literally can not defeat people who pay to win. If you can get past that though, the game is pretty solid.
5268	1	a	I have no idea what I'm doing 10 moo cows/ 7 moo cows
5270	1	a	i cant play the game because it keeps saying the app is already running 
5272	1	a	I played this game since was to EA Games, it's still beatiful so play it, now it's free.
5274	1	a	Only way to PVP in this game is to get Aimbot.. 1. The recoil is hoard, 2. the hitmarkers are as bad as MW2's
5276	1	a	I enjoy this game a lot. It's fun and you can unlock most things without having to pay real money. The customization is also very deep.
5278	1	a	This game is pretty fun for free it's very good. The customization has a wide variety from things to choose and unlock from. If you are interested into a free roaming fun time download this.
5280	1	a	I love this game and always will :)
5282	1	a	Simply Awesome !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5284	1	a	Everyone's a criminal technically.
5286	1	a	Fun game to play with friends. Even tho it has its problems and a bunch of cheaters!
5288	1	a	fun game with a lot of choices for your character and alot of crazy fun in multiplayer
5290	1	a	Great game. Full of criminality and damn right awesomness
5292	1	a	This game is like GTA V but less 'freedom' yet F2P and a MMO. But no helicopters, Strip clubs, the action in GTA V and more confined. Good game though.
5294	1	a	fun but very pay to play
5296	1	a	Surprisingly fun.
5298	1	a	i have been playing this game since it was not on steam, i like the game because of the customization of everything you have, car your person and guns. some people say that this game is pretty pay 2 win, whihc yes i can see that you can pay money to buy op guns, but alot of games are like that, so really it just up to personal prefrence
5300	1	a	Good game, but seriously needs improvement. Just because it's unique, only one of its kind in the MMO genre, that I continue to play it.  6/10  
5302	1	a	Awsome game!!!!!!!!!!
5304	1	a	This is a good game.
5306	1	a	a very fun game of cops and robbers, sometimes frustraiting with the pay-to-win method of the game but its fun all over all teamgame.
5308	1	a	Games isnt starting  The small window pops up it installs the latest patch but doesnt open
5310	1	a	I like this game but the lack of Staff is infuriating. The Match-up system can be irritating and put you with players WAY over your level. I prefer to play this with friends and fool around. I tend to rage if I do otherwise :)
5312	1	a	Yes, i have a lot of fun playing this game. Should be better with friends but i didnt play with any.
5314	1	a	In APB Reloaded you take on the role of a Criminal - hell-bent on causing havoc and making money, or an Enforcer - tapped by the city to keep order. The city never sleeps and the fight never ends in this fast paced Massively Multi-player, Action Shooter!
5316	1	a	♥♥♥♥
5318	1	a	Damn nice game to play with friends.
5320	1	a	Easy to play, and easy to have fun with friends.
5322	1	a	Fun game, though slowly turned into a pay to win, but still, worth playing if new to the whole, MMO.
5324	1	a	THIS IS BEST GAME I HAVE SEEN ON STEAM FOR FREE!
5326	1	a	A Nice Open world GTA Style game. Just get it play and enjoy!
5328	1	a	Gave me alot of fun for a free game, But i found that everything is very repetative and it gets boring after a while. It is worth downloading in my opinion tho
5330	1	a	Hack vs Hack free2play
5332	1	a	Great game. If you like Grand Theft Auto, you'll love this. Very great character customization, car customization, and it's just an all-around fun game.
5334	1	a	wicked awesome but it's kinda laggy sooooooo....... MEH  my rating: 8.5/10
5336	1	a	Incredibly fun, an easy way to get the GTA feel without playing GTA. Really stresses the difference between the Law and the Law breakers. A must-have if you love being the buster, or busting the busters. The one negative I can see in this game is the need for a high-end graphics card and good internet connection. Graphics are a big part of what makes this game run smoothly, so that being said, this is not a game for the weak of graphics cards.
5338	1	a	I LOVE THIS GAME ITS THE BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5340	1	a	cops and robbers: the game 10/10
5342	1	a	♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ cheaters everywhere....enjoy
5344	1	a	Pretty ♥♥♥♥ing dope game!
5346	1	a	Its an ok game the only thing I hate about it is the fact people are running around in diapers and shooting you with overpowerd pistols and you constantly get hit by a car by random people and the civlians holy crap their so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ its ridiculous they constanly get in your way you have to shoot the enemy 100000000000000000000 times for them to die other than that the customization is realy cool it reminds me of SaintsRow some of the people are great to play with in that game I recommend you play with a friend if your new you get put with the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that dont know what the hell they are doing.
5348	1	a	Best dress up game ever made. Also really fun to play with bros for a while.
5350	1	a	its a good game but pay to win and all the lag, the gold threat level guys who always kick you from a mission, and other stuff make it very frustrating sometimes
5352	1	a	yeah this game is really cool , i play it with my friends . im already rank 200+ HMU get stunned and cuff'd ♥♥♥♥♥s.
5354	1	a	Great idea, not great game. Loads of cool thing behind pay walls, some items are pay to win, severs can be lagy and a fair few hackers. Got a mate or two the game can be real fun, other wise it's pretty bad.
5356	1	a	Game is super cool.T.H.E.B.E.S.T Cool, Cool, Cool, Cool, Cool GAME xD             
5358	1	a	I got killed by jumping off a 1 story building  10/10
5360	1	a	This game has excellent customization, not even AAA titles come close to the amount of customization this game has. Too bad the core game is not as good (a bit pay to win too). Had fun with this though, you really should try this game.
5362	1	a	destroyed my life RECOMMEND
5364	1	a	Cool game 
5366	1	a	Somebody hear me! 
5368	1	a	i drove a car once or twice
5370	1	a	Epic! i recommend it
5372	1	a	for the amount I've played this game, I honestly had Fun. It took a while to get adjusted but You get used to it. I enjoy the whole ideal of choosing wheather or not You be a Criminal or a Cop. You can possibly (I'll have to play more to check) be a dirty cop or be undercover. I could see that being something in this kind of game. Correct Me if I was wrong in the last bit, but for what I've seen so far I've seen countless hours of fun.
5374	1	a	I dont see why people are giving this game bad reviews...   This game is 10x more detailed than GTA 5 when it comes to customization. Picture this, choose if you want to be a cop or a criminal/gangster and doing missions and recieving rewards for each task you.   Even following a tutorial will give you gifts. I do however notice how the best players in the game are the people who spend alot of REAL money on the game. But... This game gripped me and i enjoyed it emensly.   Hope this helped :')
5376	1	a	Dont let my steam play hours fool you. I've been playing APB off and on again sense Key to the City was a 3 day early access pre-order bonus under RTW (makers of the game) and not a +$90 cash shop bundle. So iv got closer to 500-1000hrs.  This game was great in its early years. This is the game that got me into PC gaming. This is the game i joined my first clan in. Nothing is more fun than a GTA style mmo. I dont even know how to write a review about this game so im just gonna do another Pros and Cons.  Pros:  Gameplay - its just plain fun to play cops and robbers Competitive - people talk trash and tbag. If your a big baby then dont play this game. There are REALLY good players that will seem like they are hacking but most aren't. Ranking - theres Green, bronze, silver and gold that indicates your win to lose ratio. Customization - ITS CRAZY. It no Illustrator but some artists could fool me. There’s little more that’s as satisfying than when you sell a car and you run into the person that bought it in game. Guns - Guns, guns, guns. I love guns. Down bullets go. Into ur torso. mm mm mm. Little guns, big guns, guns that go boom. i lovem all. 1-3 mod slots with each mod having their own pros and cons. Prebuilt guns if you not a high level for slotted ones too. Missions - Theres only a hand full but there's enough variety and locations on the map where they take place that you hardly notice.  TDM - eh, not my thing but people like it. I like to have a mission instead of just running around shooting peopl. Music - you can play music from your PC in game to feel like a badass. I'm not entirely sure how it works now but it used to be if the game didn't know what the song was it would play it for you and play a song of the same genera for others.  Cons: Pay to win (?) - it used to be VERY pay to win. in the last week or so that iv started playing again i haven’t noticed this as much. Prices - A single gun can cost $40 to keep it permanently. Luckily there’s a try it first mode. Renting guns - you don’t buy a gun with in game money and keep it. you rent it for 10 days, buy the ammo and rent the gun again if you like it. Its a cash sink to get you to pay for the monthly sub. Im not gonna list the sub as a con because you only need 2-3 months of it to get what you want. Crybabies - SOOO many people cry hacker. People will just sit back and let the timer run out on the mission or straight up rage quit adding another loss to your ratio. In the early days my clan was accused of hacking almost every match. Its hilarious sometimes. Ranking - this is also a con because of the lack of gold ranked people. Almost all servers are rated for silver or bronze players. If you’re a gold ranking going into a silver or bronze rated server then you get penalties in XP and money. This is to keep golds from rolling over the less skilled people but sense there’s less people playing these days it’s more of a problem for golds. False Promises - Gamersfirst are just a big bunch of liers. They promised racing maps, more mission maps and bla bla bla it was all a lie. Maps became a chunk of a mission map for TDM and racing maps still don’t exist. Racing was supposed to be a way to unlock car parts but i guess they just want cash for that.  I love this game and as long as they keep the hackers out and the P2W model down low, ima keep on loven.  P.S. its bested played with a group so find a clan.
5378	1	a	From a totally honest standpoint, I had my objections when I downloaded this game, I thought 'Will this be a pay2win?, Will there be uneven player matches, Will there be hard quests and laggy servers?' Well of course. being the APB is a one of a kind MMO, it's bound to have so many negative features, but what game out there doesn't?  APB Reloaded is an action packed third-person POV game that makes you really on strategy, teamwork, and gear, and although there is a pay2win aspect, you don't need to buy gear just to be a great player. The missions do get repetitive, and it seems like the characters all give you similar quests, which is a downside, but the multiplayer integration goes along well, and most matches have several parts facing you off with opposing forces.  The game is glitchy, to be expected, but it isn't terrible. There is not much lag, and the ragdoll physics are a personal favorite of mine. One thing I do have to say that bugs me is if your car is going about 70 mph or 5000 km/h and you eject, the game gives no ♥♥♥♥s and you get out unphased. Please fix  Overall, it's a quite smooth, relaxing game, that's really good to play with friends. A big tip to getting famouse would be to make and sell whatever products you make. Always take requests and form alliences at the social districts, or in missions. And lastly, just have fun. Don't let what people tell you to persuade you to not pick up this game, it's a good waste of a few gigs. So see for yourself. If you found my review helpful, please thumbs it up and let others see how good this game is.
5380	1	a	Worth a download.  aka AMAZING!!!
5382	1	a	
5384	1	a	Lagfest. hacker fest, p2w and not p2w at the same time.
5386	1	a	Its free you can steal cars and shoot people!
5388	1	a	The gameplay and customizing in this game is incredible I have played since the beta and I will always love this game
5390	1	a	Fun game until you do well. It moves you up in the ranking and you start playing super high level people with lots of experience and the game stops being fun. Fun for a while though!
5392	1	a	Discontinued ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Whyareyouonmyulibrary/100.
5394	1	a	Lots of flaws, but overall a good game. Firefights can get frustrating when some are using 'perks' *wink wink*, but the level of cuztomization on not only your car but your character makes it worth while. From snowmen to chickens, batman, and GI Joe theres an endless amount of player decorations. There is also a Marketplace where you can P2W (Pay2Win). Nice that the game itself is F2P(Free2Play) though, so by ranking up and pledging you will 'eventually' earn items instead of buying them outright anyway.
5396	1	a	If you like games such as SANIC 06 and Shaq-Fu then you will love the ♥♥♥♥ed up mess that is APB:RELOADED. PLAYING WITH A TOASTER IN A BATH TUB ON COPIOUS AMOUNTS OF METH IS MORE FUN THAN THIS GAME!!!!
5398	1	a	If you are willing to pay for microtransactions in-game, solid recommendation right here. A great open-world with a good amount to do other than main missions and endless customization option for your player, clothing, weapons and cars. If you're not willing to pay for microtransations, I can't give it as much praise. This game is full of micro-transactions that will net you the best guns, gear and cars and you earn money and experience at twice the F2P rate. This means that if you decide to play for free, then you should be aware that you will get absoloutely demolished at some stages. Everything is an enormous grind and even though decent weapons are relatively cheap, they are only temporary.
5400	1	a	a fun free play,action packed,gta like game
5402	1	a	Ok, so, this is a great game with greater potential. Yet, I cannot see ANY players. I ordered a Yellow gun skin for $5 and it has not appeared. Apparently I've wasted my Steam wallet. :/ It's fun and all driving a car, but why restrict the player to just one area? Shouldn't there be a way to travel between places? Besides the loniness and the depth of each area, there is an NPC. I cannot talk to him/her, I expected a bit more from this game.
5404	1	a	i love this game, its just like gta but free :D  i dont know why people would hate this game ughh.  
5406	1	a	Ok, yes this game CAN be fun. it can be very fun, BUT it is only fun maybe 20% of the time. The other 80% of the time you want to punch a hole into your moniter over something so stupid. It might not get you off the bat, but I promise you, if you play this game long enough you WILL rage. you WILL get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ over stupid team-mates. you WILL get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off at stupid missions. You WILL get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at an enemy for using an overpowered weapon or being a camping ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. It will pile on and on and on until you break and you rage. I have almost 800 hours in this game (only counts the time ive spent playing through steam) and can honestly say that due to the amount of hackers in the game, (despite their brand new fairfight system) there's enough of them to guarantee you will run in to one while you play, and once they get banned, they just make another account and come right back. So dealing with them is hard enough for anyone, but the fact remains, that there ARE hackers in this game and the WILL destroy you.   With all I've said, I do recommend this game but with a disclaimer. PLAY AT YOUR OWN RISK because you WILL get mad at some point and want to smash your face into a brick wall
5408	1	a	pretty good
5410	1	a	This game suck ♥♥♥. I cant believe they even bothered to make a crap game like this one, where you create a f***ing perfect character, than just as you spawn in and get to learn the might I add SH*T controls, you get kicked within a minute for NO F***ING REASON FOR F***'S SAKE!!! This happened to me about 10 god d*mn times and I got sick of watching the stupid repeditive loading screen, so I uninstalled this crappy turd blossom of a 'game' and f***ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥ on the ad in gameinformer. If you get this game after reading this... have fun wasting your time. Piece of smelly sh*t.
5412	1	a	IT'S AWSOME you can't deni it.... IT THE SECOND GTA. BUT WITHOUT HELI'S AND STUFF
5414	1	a	sick sick game 
5416	1	a	it really fun
5418	1	a	Awesome game , ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Company(Theifs).
5420	1	a	well there would have been better cars and bank robberies and that the criminal can give himself up to the vigilantes and that the criminal will be locked up for half an hour or 15 minutes if he gives himself up
5422	1	a	it is a great game you just gotta have a good computer to play it
5424	1	a	I like this game because its very good action, more than more weapon, and its pretty!
5426	1	a	The most toxic and pay to win game i have ever played. Step one start the game, Step 2, try to talk to anyone and get called names and listen to little kids rage about (not spending birthday money on a game or run around with autoaimbots and speed hacks and blah blah blah) not winning a match.   This game tried to be what grand theft auto is and failed, and twice as toxic. the only reason i am rating this game so high is to get this viewed. In no way do i recomend this game to anyone, if you want to play grandtheftauto you should
5428	1	a	cool game but i dont see many people playing this game
5430	1	a	╔╦╗╔╦╗╔╦╦╦╦╦╗╔╗ ║╚╣║║║╚╣╚╣╔╣╔╣║╚╣╣ ╠╗║╚║║╠╗║╚╣║║║║║╣ ╚╩╩╩╩╩╚╩╩
5432	1	a	Ever wanted to be a Cop or a Criminal?? This is your chance!!
5434	1	a	♥♥♥♥ed Game
5436	1	a	used to love this game but it's getting crappier and crappier..
5438	1	a	Customization is so fantastic
5440	1	a	Everything seems expensive. A player who bought almost all the gears can beat you up in just 2 secs. I don't know what is the goal of this game.. yet. You can try it out if you want, i won't hold you back from playing this game.
5442	1	a	More GTA-style fun than GTA can dish out.
5444	1	a	Fun game- Well worth playing and spending many hours wit.
5446	1	a	Excellent FTP game that is fun to play with friends or just when bored. Downside is the lag that you may sometimes experience from this games heavy usage. Other than that this game is truelly amazing for being free.
5448	1	a	I Recommend This But, I Wouldn't Recommend To Play It For Hours Upon Hours
5450	1	a	awsome cars awsome guns awsome parkour
5452	1	a	Funny game just wreck some peoples day and you will feel much better.
5454	1	a	Ohhh APB. First of all, to effectivley be good at this game (in my opinion), you need to have more than the required specs. I use a laptop with 4GB ram and an I7, but some junkyard graphics card, and lag is my middle name. Other than that, this game is fantabulous. Playing by yourself (killing boys and what not) is awesome in itself, but when you play with friends, its a diferen't story. This is one of my favorite games to play with friends (whether met online or in person). It is a real life-sucker though becuase of how much fun it is. If you take that as good or bad, I completley reccomend APB to anyone looking for an awesome shoot em' up game.
5456	1	a	One cold lonesome day I was strolling around the town. robbed a man hopeing to hide the evidence. but then the cop came up behind me..... handcuffed me... I thought it was it for me......... after he was done handcuffing me he directly shot me in the head. What could be the point of this story........ it was that apb cops are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥....
5458	1	a	Great game
5460	1	a	Worth a download.  aka AMAZING!!!
5462	1	a	One great thing is the drug mule's one of the greatest side missions ever
5464	1	a	Awesome cops and robbers style gameplay that pits criminals against enforcers. Crims get to ram-raid shops for quick cash and Enforcers get to use 'less than lethal' (LTL) weapons to bring an enemy in alive by arresting them for more points and cash, along with 'witnessing' crimes by pressing ALT on a criminal commiting a crime in order to get a bounts mission on them.  Overall a great game with tons of customization options and a wide variety of weapons.  A solid third person shooter with a solid style.  9/10 [Mersey seal of approval.]
5466	1	a	♥♥♥♥♥♥, terrible service plauged my experience with this game, do NOT get it.
5468	1	a	Got killed by car falling from the sky, 30/10.
5470	1	a	It's free, so why don't try it.
5472	1	a	This game is great. You can have a criminal character or an enforcer character, and engage in PvP combat with other players by starting missions within the game. It is PvP based however, so if you aren't into PvP, I wouldn't recommend this game for you, for there are no bots to kill aside from the civilians. There are open-world crimes that criminals can commit and enforcers can witness, or there are official missions with objectives, which yield higher rewards and almost always throw you into a PvP situation, unless you happen to be one of the only people in the district. Some open-world crimes you can commit as a criminal are mugging and ram-raiding. Overall this is a great game for people looking for a Grand Theft Auto type of game for free, though this isn't too much like Grand Theft Auto, honestly.  My Ratings PvP - ★★★★★ PvE - ☆☆☆☆☆ Customization - ★★★★★ Driving - ★★☆☆☆ Open-world crimes - ★★☆☆☆ Missions - ★★★★☆ Weapons - ★★★☆☆ Community - ★★☆☆☆  Overall - ★★★★☆
5474	1	a	This game really deserves more players, it's good hyper-blasting cop-killing, crime stopping fun.  there are flaws but it's still great fun with friends  8/10
5476	1	a	Lagfest. hacker fest, p2w and not p2w at the same time.
5478	1	a	fun gets old but for sure fun and entertianing
5480	1	a	this game is the best but i wonderd what if i riched the last lvl in the whole game  would it be fun?
5482	1	a	Boring as ♥♥♥♥ when alone. Fun as ♥♥♥♥ with a friend. Customazation of charecter is unlimited oppertunities. 99% of everything is earned. not much pay-to-wins. +supports nicolas cage 9.4/10
5484	1	a	Fantastic free to play game! Think of it as a competitive, objective based version of GTA. Really fun to play with friends!
5486	1	a	Three words: Saint's Row MMO....Nuff said.
5488	1	a	this ♥♥♥♥ flame ♥♥♥♥♥
5490	1	a	Great persistant world GTA-like MMO! Absolutely love it! :D
5492	1	a	Awsome game. Awsome when alone and even better when playing with about 2 friends.
5494	1	a	NPCs duck in cases of vehicles speeding at them.  P.S. nearly unlimited customization, meaning oversexualized anything.  Highly recommend for MAXIMUM ODOR BLOCKING POWER! 10/10
5496	1	a	Makes me moist in my ♥♥♥♥.
5498	1	a	Its an MMORPG of Grand Theft Auto, but if your graphics can't take the hit or you got a lousy internet connection, you may want to hold off getting it--the Lag kills.
5500	1	a	Alright, not a bad game. However, it's more playable if you have a group of friends playing with you. Overall a 7.5/10. Remove the pay-to-win button, then we'll talk.
5502	1	a	If you would like to kill some time, this might be one of the top free2play games out there. However by F2P you should know that the game dominate by those who spend cash on it. Which isn't cheap etheir. You can easily waste 20-30 dollars on weapons and other features.  I still recommend this for those who have not yet tried it. Tyvm..
5504	1	a	Cops vs Criminals. Have you ever played 25 to life? Like it? Get this. Want to roam through the streets as a Crim? Get this. Want to be a not-so-clean cop? Get this. Like screwing with padestrians? Get this. Like saving them? Get this. Want ultimate male/female &amp; clothes customization? Get this. Even wicked [cop] car cusomization? Get this. Want war just cause? Get this. Vehicle, and gun stat customization? Get this. 50 vs 50 gameplay? Get this. Want missions/story that greatly tie in? Get this. Like GTA? They arn't really alike which is great for this game so go play that. Like free? Get this. Don't like any of that stuff? Get this.
5506	1	a	Epic free roaming game that reminds me of gta
5508	1	a	its good and all 
5510	1	a	If you can't afford any of the Saint's Row or GTA games, this should be next on your list. Very fun game, with a great community, great customization, and fantastic open world opportunities. They do need to patch a few things here and there, but overall, APB is a very solid game for a F2P title. Highly recommend.
5512	1	a	He was a cop, and good at his job. But then he committed the ultimate sin and testified against other cops - gone bad. Cops who tried to kill him, but got the woman he loved instead. Framed for murder, now he prowls the badlands. An outlaw hunting outlaws, a bounty hunter - an Enforcer! \nn/
5514	1	a	this game is the ♥♥♥♥. u need to play it :) 
5516	1	a	did game is good anf ftp soo yerp
5518	1	a	Yeah it better good but it doesn work on the first try redownload it it has happen and check wht type of pc it runs on
5520	1	a	Great GTA online style game.
5522	1	a	This is like gta but FREE
5524	1	a	I greatly recomend this game it may seem hard at the beginning but get that you dont start with good gear,cars,guns,etc. But in the end it doesnt even matter. Because there might be that one person who will help you out and wont be a massive tool to people. And also the fact that people spam idiotic things in chat forget that not everyone is like that. If you read some of the peoples comments were it says its PTW and stuff about Premium, well the stuff thats PTW can be bought well most of it you just have to use the gun in that class to level it up and then get better Assaults,Marksmans,Snipers,Shotguns,etc to get the good gear. This game also has a great customization of gear that is pretty unique. But thats what I think play it to get your own opinion.
5526	1	a	Yeah its good although its not my type of game although i love gta this just doesnt have it's charm. But you HAVE to try it out :P
5528	1	a	It's fun. So much. But it sucks, i told you.
5530	1	a	This game becomes you.
5532	1	a	I remember it being good. Now im gonna start playing again. 
5534	1	a	ITS FREAKIN LIKE GTA V!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I LUV IT SO MUCH FUN!!!!!!!!!! ITS GTA V JUNIOR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!ITS GTA V FOR FREE!!!! PLAY IT AND PLAY WITH ME IM A NUB!!!! xD &lt;3
5536	1	a	Awesome game really fun
5538	1	a	I would say yes to get this game because its kind of like grand theft auto plus its a free game but i would strongly recomend for you to play it on a newer computer because the older ones dont work out so good with the game but still it is a fun game to have and play.
5540	1	a	Pretty fun the only problem is the maturity level of other gamers outside of your match.The two teams are basically just aesthetically different with no real pathology difference other than the enforcers have a different way of leveling up based on their relation to the crims and they are easier to play based on gear and the fact that they are kind of parasites and bully's in the way that they relate to the crims and the crims don't really have a way to make it up other than fighting the enforcers so playing as a crim is tougher and is kind of I guess the main player class wit the enforcers being kind of a heel to the crims face. The weapons are kind of dumb and do not relate to the real world counterparts and lead to some questionable fire exchanges as well as a lot of disappointing outcomes for mission success' the cars are pretty cool because you can edit them to a standard of your liking aesthetically and physically and also the avatars are really the best part of the game, you can make just about anything you would like within the paradigm of what is giving to you by the company as options and the difference in options to a free player does not relate to those given to a premium, player, also there is no balance and the stated percentage of players that would can and are gold players is not real it is a hack heavy gay abuse chat room with poor gameplay no balance and a lot of racism homophobia and unacceptable adult minor interactions as well as you pay to win... But it's so effin awesome that you can basically destroy mentalists and austastic gaytards and they pay to lose that bad. You cannot rate a game this terrible in relation to legitimate products that have a standard of production applied to the creation of the end product, it is basically like the studio 54 of this era and is fun because it is a sloppy drunken attempt at an online Grand Theft Auto and for some reason has a really frightening consumer base gay minors attracted to a false criminal identity and anti social misfits that do not actually like to work for accomplishment or title of praise based on relation to those that are not as good as them. Don't expect much don't do any of the crazy things you see mental ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ doing and just enjoy it for what it is while it's here and remember how crazy it was after it is gone.
5542	1	a	In my opinion this game is the closest you can get to 'F2P GTA online'. You can customize pretty much everything in this game and you can have a ton of fun. However its one of the games that even though the gameplay is good and the graphics are okay..it suffers from technicall issues. I have played this game in 2 different PCs. One desktop and one laptop and i had problems in both. The game lags a lot from times to times. There are several reports about Crashing(loads and loads of crashing).Either way...if you can get through these problems and be able to play this game fluidly then you will have a lot fun provided that you wont mind the repetitiveness of some missions.
5544	1	a	This is like GTA. Really nice game. I recommend it to everyone
5546	1	a	APB is a awesome 3rd person player game. Fun to play and u can costumize alot of equipment and vehicles 
5548	1	a	Awesome game. It's like GTA Free to Play... Neverending customizable options for your Character/Car/Music. Run through the City, fight for/against the Law, Spread the safety/terror. Shoot, steal or complete the randomly generated missions. Run up your rank/Prestige, buy weapons, cars and upgrade them. Definitely worth a try. Only problem were cheaters.. but that's from the time it wasn't on Steam and like almost 1 year back, I wonder how they solved that problem.
5550	1	a	To actually permanently buy an item you have to pay an extreme amount of in-game cash. Besides that it is fun. 3/5
5552	1	a	I writing a game review cause I have to. Game is good if you play it a lot. its hard to get enough coin to get any good gear
5554	1	a	Yes very cool game!play lot of time!
5556	1	a	used to be fun, now it's for trolls unfortunately :(
5558	1	a	One of those games that's really awesome to play, but you may need some breaks and intervals betwwen playing it. Overall, the best f2p game I've tried. DEFINITELY spending money on this game.
5560	1	a	Reminds me of GTA: Online Sometimes fun, Sometimes boring
5562	1	a	It's like a massive multiplayer online game of cops and robbers based on Grand Theft Auto.
5564	1	a	An epic masterpiece for any who dare to be creative, tactically cunning and heroic in an MMO world... With virtually limitless customization for your character and ride, an in depth modification skill tree, music creation program, and an evergrowing arsenal of weapons, you'll be able to become the ultimate warrior... Whether in a group or playing lone wolf, you'll be kicking ♥♥♥ in style!
5566	1	a	It's a good alternative to GTAV. Maybe better.
5568	1	a	MVP in my white tee, playing for free on a killing spree.  
5570	1	a	Got into the game and it instantly crashed. After an hour of setting it up, creating accts galore, it crashes. I got back in and played around a little bit. Not much to entertain me though.
5572	1	a	It's good dumb fun. The matchmaking tries its hardest to put you against people your skill level, so don't fret if you're terrible, you'll be put against those who are as well. :)  It's a decent game, I'd suggest it to those who want to goof around and customize their character to all hell.  Wish it had a decent roleplay community, sadly.. no.
5574	1	a	I think they should make this Mac supported :) Its a really good game and would be even better if everyone had access
5576	1	a	Everyone who thinks this game is bad just needs to shut up. I love the game its fun. I have only played as enforcer but i have seen crims can be cool to. But if you cause trouple in my town your gona get REKT.
5578	1	a	A Grand Theft Auto for free. The graphics look exactly like GTA IV(4) but better. You can do free roam around the city or you can do missions with your friends. If parkour was added into this game, I would play it everyday!
5580	1	a	horrible.
5582	1	a	WOOT WOOT ♥♥♥♥ GTA GO THIS jk Still really good 
5584	1	a	It's a great and fantastic game for all!!
5586	1	a	mister shmoo played it so i have to
5588	1	a	steam://install/113400
5590	1	a	sweet game for free
5592	1	a	awesome free to play game 
5594	1	a	Play APB Reloaded!!! APB Reloaded is an awesome 3rd person shooter, well at least I thinkit is! It is really just a better version of GTA! You can customise everything about your clothing and/or car! You are allowed to create any symbols to put on your car or put on your body as tatoos. I really dont know what else to say, Its jsut that good!
5596	1	a	Best gta clone in mmo form.
5598	1	a	Very good mmo game.Sometimes the servers are not so good but it is nice.
5600	1	a	This is a great game sure its kinda a bit mixed up with its missions and challenges but heck its no gta for it to be similar for yougta fans out there if you want something similar i suggest you download this game ;)
5602	1	a	I really enjoyed roaming the several cities with my custom-made car. Then hop right into a team and work together on completing a mission. Unlock new items and be able to customize my characters look as well. Probably the best thing about this game is the customization feature. You can even broadcast your own music to the world around you and others can hear your own cars radio as you fly by. NOT TO MENTION IT'S FREE!
5604	1	a	I was dissapointed about the fact that when I wanted to make a van with the word 'Candy'on it with a backwords D, the game told me to pay money   1/10
5606	1	a	An absolutely fantastic game. think Gta online
5608	1	a	Great Game,Wonderful Supplement if you don't have enough change to get GTA5.Highly recommend, I have enjoyed many hours capin camping noobs in apb reloaded.
5610	1	a	A Pretty decent time killer if you like instant action, cars and customization!
5612	1	a	Nice shot!
5614	1	a	Awesome game, loads of fune once you unlock the van 
5616	1	a	The besty adreniline rushing game and addicting game ever played 
5618	1	a	This is a very good game, it can be Car Jacked, Being Arrested, it just like Grand Theft Auto, It's a very good experiance if you can check it out
5620	1	a	Im making my way downtown.....*gets rammed by a freindly car*....friend enters cars and says:' Why dont you go?'....and i just look at my totaled car and say:'Get the F*** out of my mother f****** face you fake police officer'....and then we get blown up by a criminal....the vicious cycle of APB!
5622	1	a	Dont waste your time on this. I used to love this game but now it is dominated by hackers and poor match making. RIP realtime worlds you had an awesome game once.
5624	1	a	iT'S Almost GTA EXCEPT FREE!!
5626	1	a	The game is always very interesting. It is dynamic in all the missions and you never know what you are going to get. At times it does get laggy and prone to crashes, but that is quite rare.
5628	1	a	This game is very fun, and interesting once you get over hackers and cheaters. It offers a lot of things do not in this open world cops and robbers genre. It is a lot cleaner, and runs better to date than when it first launched. Lots of improvements and it's just lots of fun. I never thought my most played game when I came to PC would be a free to play.
5630	1	a	it may seem boring at first but when you give the game a shot you will see that it gets better and better.
5632	1	a	Played this for quite a while and had a lot of fun. Customization is unparalled and the driving and shooting mechanics are well done. On the downside, lots of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s play this game. Kids in garbage trucks and hackers galore. The lag is also a serious problem at times, making APB almost unplayable at times.
5634	1	a	Fun customizable characters, cars, clothes, guns, and pretty much anything you can think of. Great fun with friends, fun for solo play, fun in general. But the one thing I can't stand is how laggy the servers are, and how many hackers there is. Besides those 2 problems....Its great!
5636	1	a	If you like GTA-style games where you roam around a city and do random stuff? If so, you will enjoy this because it has customization system unimaginably briliant. When you start off, you create your own character. There are so many little things you can change with your character's face. You can also customize your car, as well as buying new cars. Once again, the customization is huge, probably the most of a single game. This game is a cops-and-robbers style game and I have to say, it is pretty fun. Also, you won't need such of a beefy computer to play APB Reloaded, just have a dedicated graphics card, and you'll be fine.
5638	1	a	I very much recommend this game to anyone really, it's a very fun game indeed and has a excellent player-base in my opinion. There may be a few bugs and lag issues but the fun content in the game makes up for al that. 5/5 stars!
5640	1	a	I started playing APB whenever I got bored of World of Warcraft and enjoy coming back to it time to time. It's fun to customize characters and have all out wars between criminals and enforcers.
5642	1	a	Fun game to PLay as Cops and Robbers
5644	1	a	This is like gta4 cops and robbers mode excpet you get to actually break into houses and customize your character
5646	1	a	this is a pretty good game its pretty much gta 4 free its really fun  ur eaver poilice or gangsters 
5648	1	a	Its Fun Epic And Free!
5650	1	a	An excellent third person shooter with tons of ability to customize your look and your vehicle. The game consists of two very large (1000+ meters) city maps where many teams of either faction are engaged in missions simultaneously. All in all a fantastic third person shooter that I spent hundreds of hours playing!  Pros - Full customization of vehicle and character with large multitudes of clothing and the ability to make completely custom designs. Every character and vehicle looks completely unique. - Large array of guns with custom skins, though most of the skins have to be bought through the in game store. - Progression system. If you like these, it's there. You get quick access to the base versions of guns, so it's not too bad. Though, things such as the OPGL and OSMAW come much later, as well as a couple of the cars. - Frequently matched against new people, so you're not playing against the same team over and over again like in other multiplayer shooters.  Cons - The open world can lead to griefing and 'ghosting' on occasion, or just some frustration as you're trying to drive to the next objective as quickly as you can while getting rammed by cars driven by other players. - Some of the guns in the in game store which cost real money to buy can be considered across the board better than some of the guns available as free to play.
5652	1	a	litealy the best free rome game ever... kinda like just skrew around for the hell of it
5654	1	a	Propanity. 10/10
5656	1	a	A nice F2P and MMOTPS to play, check it out.
5658	1	a	doesnt work well not the best havent even been able to play it
5660	1	a	its a game 
5662	1	a	THIS...IS...AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! BEST FPS/ Free to play EVER!!
5664	1	a	I love this,is a GTA ONLINE,free to play and pay to win. SpartanElite says:'FU** Yeah, I enjoy it!' A Poor Idiot says:'I hate dis 'cuz i nevah vin and becoz i hate nobs'n'pay too wiin playyers' Final review: I LOVE IT!
5666	1	a	Basicly GTA multiplayer. Teams of Cops vs Robbers duke it out while attempting to complete multi part missions consisting of different win conditions (CTF, Take and Hold, etc.) with 1,000,000 custimization options for characters, vehicles, and weapons. Very pick up and play friendly, great for some quick, fun carnage.
5668	1	a	Very fun game, Love it :) Too bad couple hackers around sometimes hope they get to fix that
5670	1	a	this game is like gta but more fun  
5672	1	a	An excellent Game to play with a friend. If you play solo it's not as fun. Picture GTA without a story line and an MMO system for unlocks. Only issues I had with this game is it will run at 2Gigs of ram ALL THE TIME and OMG the hackers.
5674	1	a	Play this for customisation and having a laugh.  Don't take it seriously, community members range from awesome to asshat.  The game has a hacker problem, so don't bother trying to be competitive.  3.5 out of 5 panties.
5676	1	a	Simply one word: Amazing!
5678	1	a	The Cops vs Robbers you dreamed of, but with less freedom and more trolls. The dress up is awesome, the combat isn't terrible, and it's ♥♥♥♥ing free. You want it and there is no reason not to get it.
5680	1	a	pay2win ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that I will likely play again with my friends because I remember that my avatar in game is really tall, has a great tan, striped panties, and DEM HIPS. ♥♥♥♥.
5682	1	a	Great game good to play free to play if you want to put some hours into it. Creativity in a game is one of the best parts of this game. The extend you can go with your creativity is so large! And a lott of fun to play with your friends.

5686	1	a	very good game alot to do
5688	1	a	This game is a fast-paced awesome MULTIPLAYER game. The multiplayer is captilized because that is the huge fault of this game, when your waiting for players this is the worst game but when you have at least 4 people on a server it's an insanely fun game. WARNING: It has a steepish learning curve (use the internet for tutorials)
5690	1	a	takes a while to grasp this game. the thought of it is really cool. the game is sorta stable now. they messed it up in the beginning so everyone cut bait and ran. I wish more people played it to have the epic street fights its supposed to have. massive level cap, easy to control. not the biggest variety until you get higher in the levels 7.25/10
5692	1	a	its pretty good too bad its not for mac though
5694	1	a	very nice game just like GTA the graphics look kind of like Saint Row The Third 'i think so :D' better get this game
5696	1	a	The game in itself is probably the most unique MMO out on the market to this point. You get to enjoy all the fun of a free roam city game like GTA or Saints Row with the excitement of thousands of other players thrown into the mix.  But the game does have a dark side. Hackers slip through the hack sheilds like water through a streamer. Which is actually the primary reason that I stopped playing the game some time ago. But it's definately a game to try if you can run it. 8/10
5698	1	a	great game
5700	1	a	it is a good game if your into non stop deathmatches
5702	1	a	APB is still getting better as time passes, they have added a lot of new grey weapons that make competing against Gold weapons easier
5704	1	a	Very good MMO its just like GTA or Saints row. if u are in to those games then u should get this game :)
5706	1	a	Any problems you have with this game are insiginificant. This is what GTA online should have been. I'll play this game until they take it offline.
5708	1	a	One of the best games i've ever played
5710	1	a	This game hits a 9/10 very easily. Can't stop playing it !!  A mix of GTA and Brink as an MMO. You can customize everything about everything about you. Your charator, your cars, your guns (if Premium), music playing while your in your car or close-by and even your death-song where every player that is killed by you hears your personal death-song!  A game where the 2 factions (Enforcers and Criminal) fight for the streets of San Paro. You team up (either Pug or not) with players to acomplish missions against the other faction. There is 100s of different games and missions. Missions sush as spraying walls of the streets, hacking antennas, steal a car and drive it to it's destination, defend Vips while kill the opposing team, loot specific key objects, capture areas and defend them for points and of course Deathmatch games. All in 2 giant parts of the City (The Waterfront and the Financial districts). Everything is live!! So you might be on a mission with your team while another team is on another mission on the other side of the street.  So much more to do as you play as a Criminal like doing a raid on a shop or mugging people on the street for their valued stuff to then steal itand bring it back to a drop-off point, Grand theft an expensive vehicule and drive it to a garage for $$. But careful not to be witnessed by an Enforcer who may take you down and bring any thing you stole to a place to gain equal $$ of the stuff you stole.
5712	1	a	its pretty good too bad its not for mac though
5714	1	a	Great game lots of Guns and Cars
5716	1	a	The game in itself is probably the most unique MMO out on the market to this point. You get to enjoy all the fun of a free roam city game like GTA or Saints Row with the excitement of thousands of other players thrown into the mix.  But the game does have a dark side. Hackers slip through the hack sheilds like water through a streamer. Which is actually the primary reason that I stopped playing the game some time ago. But it's definately a game to try if you can run it. 8/10
5718	1	a	Like ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥es? Then this game is for you!
5720	1	a	Pretty sexy.
5722	1	a	Try this.
5724	1	a	Broken, fiddly pay options, full of Russians who shout uninteligible obscenities at you, plagued by cheaters. but nevertheless a fun multiplayer shooter with some internesting gameplay that's worth the download for a look-see.
5726	1	a	oh i see you are better than me, HAX
5728	1	a	Fun but very raging! XD 
5730	1	a	Well the game has lag and a lot but when you manage to not have lag is a decent ad fun game specially for playing with friends!!
5732	1	a	its okay but there is alot of lag in some severs make sure u got high graphic computer 
5734	1	a	It is fun... But as every F2P if you dont spend some cash youll be left behind in the game progress...
5736	1	a	Having played video games of all kinds for the majority of my life, I can honestly say that no game has made me rage as much as APB. Just about every other fight threw me into a cursing, yelling, semi-psychotic fit. It was nothing short of a miracle every time I was able to restrain myself from putting my fist through the screen...  That all being said - This is very addictive and engaging game that somehow is able to throw just enough good times and memorable moments at you to counteract all the rage fuel that constantly is spewed at you. For me, this game has been the source of a great deal of amusement and one of a kind situations that will always be rememered (for better or worse). If you have the willpower to muscle through all the rage inducing moments this game has, then I strongly reccommend giving it a shot (just be sure to bring a friend).
5738	1	a	recommended by Tyron
5740	1	a	this game is one of the best online games i have played
5742	1	a	Im the pres i cannpt be copied 
5744	1	a	This is like GTA. Really nice game. I recommend it to everyone
5746	1	a	APB is a awesome 3rd person player game. Fun to play and u can costumize alot of equipment and vehicles 
5748	1	a	apb reloaded part 1 
5750	1	a	The game I've played the most. Fun Stuff!
5752	1	a	Im speechless with this game, its has so much potential though that they havent reached.
5754	1	a	it is a good game
5756	1	a	Very cool
5758	1	a	this game is exactly like gta 4 and is awesome and you can highjack cars and beat up people and steal there money there is also missions with army and tanks and planes and helicopters and tons of guns even the tommy 20.it is an awesome game so anyone who likes gta series should get this game  
5760	1	a	Fantastic game. A few flies in the soup, but those go away quickly if you send Gamers First a little money. If you want to be competitive at all, you need to purchase a gun or two from the Cash Shop. You can be competitive with a free account, but it takes a lot of grinding and time. This game has a very steep learning curve and does not go easy on new players. That coupled with acceptable matchmaking makes the first few days painful. I’ve spent $50 and have plenty to show for it and do not regret it. Expect to spend as much as you would for a normal game in their cash shop. Again, it isn’t necessary, but it helps a lot.  8/10 Total 9/10 Gameplay Mechanics 6/10 Game Developer 6/10 Player Community
5762	1	a	this is the best game ever.But one time it didn't work. :)
5764	1	a	I recommend this game to a rather limited crowd, for a couple of reasons.  _Pros_  Customisation. Probably the best I've ever seen in a game, better than Saints Row, better than the Bethesda games for character customisation. You can make your character look like pretty much anyone you choose to, let alone the great symbol customiser and car customisation is brilliant. Except the lack of non-purchased car parts, GamersFirst loves the moneys.  _Cons_  Level design is attorcious, you can lock down an entire mission for an opposing team by camping in a completely unreachable spot. San Paro is plagued by badly designed, unconquerable locations, which players can move the objective too, and will make people mash their head on the keyboard, and hang themselves on power leads with fustration. - For example, there's a mission where you have to defend a briefcase, and a team put it on a ledge, which no-one could get to as it was so over-exposed that they could be shot from 360° Horrific.  Repitition. Gaaaah, this game is full of it. Most of the missions repeat themselves over and over again, the same mission, but in slightly different locations. This is fine for the first 10 hours, but after that you're seeing same old, same old over and over again. Nothing really changes as you sit there enduring the couple of minute wait between missions.  Community. It's ♥♥♥♥, packed with hackers, and accusations of being a hacker. You'll rarely meet someone who's actually friendly, just people that are ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off by you being utterly ♥♥♥♥ and decreasing their status from Gold to Silver.  _Conclusion_  It's good for people that love customisation and shooting at things and driving, and that's pretty much it. I just happen to be one of that few that doesn't give a ♥♥♥♥ about the cons.
5766	1	a	♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ at start and that is where many people quit.Later on the game gets amazing.
5768	1	a	Very fun game, lots of varied online play.  Reminds me of GTA, but with a multiplayer aspect. It does have a pay to win aspect, but to be honest the starting guns are great. The only thing worth buying is the premium pack, which gets you like double money from missions.  Really recommend this game if you're looking for some fun filed action!  
5770	1	a	the best f2p i ever played,its a gta style based mmo,wich will grant endless hours of fun for the lovers of the style. the costumization is awesome,wich gice u the power to make very cool distinct chars or vehicles,etc... have its flaws,and requires a powerfull pc to play even in lowest settings,but the size of the worlds and the concept manage to keep the game interesting and fun.  i have 4 chars 2 accounts,and more then 2000 hours combined,it says alot about the game. im a gta lover,and this is the ultimate multiplayer for playas like me. at least till something can compete with it.  many will say its a pay to win game,but i have several premium weapons,and none of them is so overpowered like some people try to pass the image. btw if u wanna try premium search for the real retail pack in the web,will give u a premium primary weapon account lifetime,premium side arm,premium car,500g1 and 30 day premium account (wich allows to win money faster,and wider costumization) if u buy the rt1 (retail pack) check utube videos t see wich weapon is best for u. the normal player preference is (scout,csg,whisper,ntec) by the order i putted.  its very hard game to enter,with a long learning curve,but after u manage to pass that part,will become a game that u will return over and over again. a must have,and one of the best f2p in present time in my humble opinion. peace.
5772	1	a	It's like a massive multiplayer online game of cops and robbers based on Grand Theft Auto.
5774	1	a	Cool 
5776	1	a	An epic masterpiece for any who dare to be creative, tactically cunning and heroic in an MMO world... With virtually limitless customization for your character and ride, an in depth modification skill tree, music creation program, and an evergrowing arsenal of weapons, you'll be able to become the ultimate warrior... Whether in a group or playing lone wolf, you'll be kicking ♥♥♥ in style!
5778	1	a	This game has huge, huge upsides but also huge, huge downsides. It lags like ♥♥♥♥ on the lowest settings and has sub-par gun play, but the customization is amazingly detailed. It makes Skyrim's character creator look like ANIMAL CROSSING'S CHARACTER CREATION. Besides, this game's still in beta no matter what they say. Killing civilians isn't even considered a crime as far as what Player Character cops can do about it. The thing that sets APB apart from other MMOs is the fact that it isn't an RPG. There are NO NPC's other than civilians and salesmen. That means no ♥♥♥♥ing grinding. Whether or not you like this game, you have to admit it is unique among MMOs and games in general.
5780	1	a	its the greatest game ever :)
5782	1	a	This game has addictable gamplay but also it's poorly optimized ( Laggs,fps problems)
5784	1	a	Certainly at its best when playing with a group of friends. Sure the game might try to reason with you to spend money on the game (Decals limits, exclusive items, powerful weapons, increased EXP rate) and have bad community where in my case, people swearing left and right and accusing of hacks. It has bugs but if you're with someone you call as a friend it's easy to let those errors slip aside. If you have someone playing the game, give it a try. If not, well you can try and make friends over there.
5786	1	a	PRETTY NICE GAME! alot of bugs and could be a little more noob friendly but oh well , still it gets a 7.5/10
5788	1	a	The best pay-to-win game.
5790	1	a	This game touches me in special places... download it!
5792	1	a	Really fun game, its amazing, i love it its very hard to kill since there are no headshots or crits. if you hit them, you hit them no ups or downs the damage is based on your weapon. mine is N-tech
5794	1	a	This game has lots of different mechanics and is basicly GTA online. It is free and i still a pretty fun game. The only thing wrong is that the servers have lots of modders. And your weapon runs out after 10 days, forcing you to buy it again. And it will take a lot of commitment, and I do mean alot.
5796	1	a	Free-2-Play 3p Shooter MMO Grand-Theft-Griefing Simluator, with enough dress-up to make Barbie jealous. If that appeals to you, then play it.  
5798	1	a	It is here, where you will step into the dumptruck...and into history.
5800	1	a	This game is ok. It has a meh comunity, good combat, exellent custumization, but unfortunatley it suffers from P2W (Pay to Win) Syndrome. Sure you can still play preatty well without paying a dime but it's limiting you. Besides from limiting your advancement it limits your creativity by not alowing you to custumize your char and vehicles up to a certain point. If you get past these things and a few reppetitiveness it can be fun with friends + its free so it's atleast worth a try.
5802	1	a	If trolling is your name and or your game, APB is for you. The incredible amount of character customization really sells this game. There are very faint threads of theme and plot, but they are insignificant. GTA multiplayer is really what you in for.  Kneel before your Garbage Truck god.
5804	1	a	From cars doing 20 kickflicks and landing perfectly, to smashing into other peoples cars with dump trucks against buildings and blowing them up, Apb is a truly good racing game.   Why drive a F1 car or a nascar when you can ride a car in APB, hit the turbo and go flying off a ramp only to land on top of a pack of roaming civilians in the parellel city to San Fransico called san paro?   The development cost for the game was 100 million dollars. But the moments that occur while in your car are truly priceless.   Feeling lucky? back up into a cuve in your jeep and get blown up. Dont worry, it only happens under certain ideal conditions.  
5806	1	a	Saints row MMO. 
5808	1	a	This game sucks
5810	1	a	APB Reloaded is a fast paced, shoot em up, Free to play, open world strategy combat MMO; and if you are any good at it, you hate it with a passion.   I recommend it.
5812	1	a	Apb is a fun game when play in a good group or with good players
5814	1	a	Oh Look at tat body Oh Look at tat body !
5816	1	a	this game is so cool 
5818	1	a	this game is the crossed magnums and the crossed shotguns
5820	1	a	Ruined My ♥♥♥♥ing life non steam -S-
5822	1	a	They screwed me once, never again.
5824	1	a	pretty good its like gta5 and justcause2 into one game called apb amazing  
5826	1	a	Great motivation and awesome customization features! Try it! Contact me to play together!!
5828	1	a	Think Grand Theft Auto meets MMO, but it's in a cops and robbers style. Now tack on a customization engine that allows player to make custom symbols, and designs for their cars and cloths. Not to mention a music maker as well.   APB is an epic game with limitless possibilities. It's now a Free 2 Play model, which in my opinion was done very well, and can allow players who don't have the luxury or desire to enjoy the game on a Free account (although there are draw backs).   In my opinion this is one of the best games I have played, and think it's awesome ... so play it!
5830	1	a	Best with Immature friends.
5832	1	a	This is really good game.
5834	1	a	play this game
5836	1	a	if you like Gta or a any 3rd person shooter you sould give this a chance
5838	1	a	I will not be afraid to call it Pay to Win, but you can have some fun in it if you play with friends.
5840	1	a	It's okay, gets repetitive after a few hours. Customization possibilities are amazing, though! &lt;3
5842	1	a	+ Good combat + Nice driving system  + A lot of customisation - You can only buy weapons for max. 10 days with the money you get in game - Almost everything is expensive so you have to spend money on it for full fun - Takes ages to get into a game sometimes
5844	1	a	Besides the weird lag spikes this game is great!
5846	1	a	apb reloaded is a free 3rd person shooter that can easily be refered to as a free mmo version of grand theft auto with a few changes. being a 2009 title it may not have the best graphics. rating 7.5/10
5848	1	a	Who wants to play GTA V When This Is A Very Nicely Done Mimic Of The GTA V Games? Plus Its Free And Not Pay To Win! - FREE
5850	1	a	Full of bugs, missions are repetative, menus make no sense, and pay-to-win guns are game-breaking. So why do I find myself keep coming back for more?
5852	1	a	Character customization is amazing with tons of depth, but the fun pretty much ends there. Once in game, things are rather boring and take awhile to warm up to, not very inviting for a newbie looking for an extremely active and fun game. Once you're far enough in to actually start making a name for yourself with all the patterns you draw and things you decorate, you're not going to let it go for awhile, too bad it takes such a long time to get to that point.
5854	1	a	It's FTP, definitely worth a try.
5856	1	a	A good game, but takes a while before you can actually begin to get good, due to the higher prices on the better weapons, and the only way to buy them permanently is with real money.
5858	1	a	If you liked the RTW but hated it's flaws, you're going to love the Reloaded version.
5860	1	a	As a veteran player and experienced everything this game has to offer i can give this game about a 7.5/10  You start the game off as either an enforcer or a criminal and work your way up through contacts. As you progress you unlock other items to lease such as weapons, cars, clothing, and customization symbols  Like any other shooter game out there, this one also has its small thorns on the side with cheaters and greifers. Its not like you dont see this in other pc shooter based games anyway.  The game is primarily a freemium model. While some premium perks do help you out, your developed-over-time skills will overcome and outweigh those perks (that is of course if you dedicate your time and focus in the game). The games itemization system is based off of leases which means you lease almost everything for a certain amount of time with the in game cash you earn. Mostly these are weapons. Cars can be permanently purchased and also be leased with in game cash. The games item shop has alot of items which you can buy permanently for both only characters and account wide ranging from unique weapons, pre set cars, car kits and some unique clothing.   Even though customization is very restricted without premium you can still buy uniqeue clothing, cars and alot of other stuff from players with in game cash that can help your character look cool and stand out.
5862	1	a	Well, I bought this game when it came out first time. Was a waste of money since it was to be shut down after 3 months. The game itself is fun but DO NOT compare it to anything such as GTA or Saints Row because it definetly isnt. Expect a game like Global Agenda but modern and FAR more customisation.
5864	1	a	Fantastic Game and low cost shop :D Enjoy
5866	1	a	APB is one of those games where you are tricked into thinking you can become really good through skill alone, unlike games like TF2, where it is just as easy to win with a free account as it is with a paid account, APB requires you to shell out a fair few quid if you have any hope of winning matches.   Sure, you win some matchs depending on your team , skill and luck, but the weapons you buy with ingame currency suck and are only avalible for 15 days or so. Permanant guns, armour, anything actually usefull is only avalible for real life money. Not so much Free to play, more pay to win.   Other than this still a decent game consiodering it is free.
5868	1	a	Whether you're a gunslinging, money stealing criminal or a street vigilanty, yet outside the outside of the law, Encforcer, get ready for guns, cars, and a f*** ton of fun
5870	1	a	This game is really, truly, one of the worst things I've ever experienced in my life.  And this is coming from a man who has eatten six, SIX, chalupas uninterrupted and had the worst explosive diarrhea known to mankind.  Avoid at all costs.
5872	1	a	If only
5874	1	a	Really fun to play with a group of friends! Great Customization! Sh*tty servers???? Lots of hackers??? Haven't seen many hackers but the server thing is kinda is sorta definitely true :L But still fun!
5876	1	a	I will bestow thee hand of justice upon thy nipple.
5878	1	a	Weird, buggy, can be fun at times, but again, like alot of games like this, you get alil outclassed by those players who play all the time.   give it a try, still a fun game, I personally just don't think it's a game that your gonna play all the time.
5880	1	a	Loads of fun, annoying at times with people that pay to win but not to bad. Good geem. 7/10
5882	1	a	Good game. A linux version would make it great.
5884	1	a	THIS IS BEST GAME I HAVE SEEN ON STEAM FOR FREE!
5886	1	a	There are a few thing I have to say about this game. It grabbed my attention because it was a cops vs. robbers type game that would keep me entertained for hours. First the cons, very repetitive, stupid A.I., cars are difficult to drive, and hard to play at first (minimal problem). Now the pros, great customization, fair for starters, teamwork is required trying to lone wolf it will get you killed, good music, own kill theme, and NPC's run away when there is gunfire.  There are some other things I want to talk about before I finish, all of the players look the same unless you look at the arrows on their head, as said before, you have to work as a team mainly because this is a team game so you have to stick with the team you have because without them you could be going 5 to 1, and the game will be extremely repetitive so you will get bored within 10 days of downloading it (maybe less) only two types of missions.  This game is a fun experience when you begin playing it and gets boring within a short amount of time, but the amount of fun you can have can be worth it if you really want to invest the time.  7/10
5888	1	a	Spent 500+ of game play and continuing. Worth it.
5890	1	a	Best game but a bit laggy
5892	1	a	One of the best customisation ever. You can put your own decal in literally everything i.e Cars, Clothes, Body and Guns.
5894	1	a	Kind of like GTA, pretty good game
5896	1	a	It's an intersting game. Criminals vs. Enforcers duking it out. It's not an MMO apart from an MMO type lobby. The game is made of closed off matches. It's more of the third person shooter variety than a MMO.
5898	1	a	loce this game
5900	1	a	sick sick game 
5902	1	a	Awesome game. I would recomend that everyone give it a try.
5904	1	a	Must try
5906	1	a	i wish the game had less standards to be useable like it should have a lower video card option and graphics card but other wise i love it
5908	1	a	Best P2W game I played 8/10
5910	1	a	A definite must-play if you're into huge open worlds with a large player base and endless customization options.
5912	1	a	If you wanna feel free to do what u can´t in real life, well you all are Welcome :)
5914	1	a	Jesus if you can get friends to play with you GOTY
5916	1	a	Graphics 5/10 Average Story and tasks 2/10 Boring... Gun Play 4/10 I seen way better. Like BF and GTA and COD. Controls 8/10 Way easy to learn. Fun 4/10 Lots of grinding.   So average!! 5/10
5918	1	a	seems like gta but better because i guess there are trailers.
5920	1	a	Awsome Game i'd recomend it to anyone that wants to play.
5922	1	a	APB is a fun game, lot of options to customize how you look and how you weapons/vehicles look. I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to have fun, as long as you are older than 12, 1. THIS GAME IS FOR MATURE PEOPLE, and 2. ANYONE UNDER THE AGE OF 12 IS FREAKING ANOYING.  There are a couple of lag/steam related issues, but if you can resolve them, its whole lot of fun. =) 
5924	1	a	I LOVE THIS GAME ITS THE BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5926	1	a	Somebody hear me! 
5928	1	a	I Luv This Game! X3
5930	1	a	Great fun, cops and robbers. But look out everyone gets there ♥♥♥ kicked once in awhile by overly good players who enjoy a bit of grif. The grif all adds up to the almost school yard feel of cops and robbers, and adds a sense of emersion into the brutal world of a city tearing itself appart in crime and vigilatisem.
5932	1	a	I like game. Game is good. Much fun. 10/10
5934	1	a	This is pretty awesome.
5936	1	a	If you like overwhelming amounts of customization, this is the game for you. Customize your own Criminal/Enforcer and roam the streets!
5938	1	a	I haven't played long but I can say enough about this game. Pros 1.Good customization rated #1 when it cme out dont know how it is now.   Cons 1. Hackers by the date this is posted there is an anti cheater system installed probably will make people actually buy stuff instead of hack for money or use aimbot 2. LAGGY!!! Imagine Darth Vader walking 20 steps and just teleporting 90 feet even with his extreme high tech ♥♥♥♥ he cant escape the server lag escpecially when hes fighting obi-wan and obi-wan won instead of darth vader. 3. Matchmaking is ♥♥♥♥ especially for beginners like me High level players can join and rank district they want and pwn the ♥♥♥♥ outta you and they still while you sit in your chair and cry or just get so furious you literally punch the ♥♥♥♥ outta this computer. 4. Pay to win everyone uses it I didnt. 5. DLC is too exspensive its $134 for all three plus the premeium you'll have to pay if you want to excell faster and unlock more. 6. Don't listen to weapon stats its a lie. It may say high damage but still takes alot to kill example Obir normal no perks has high damge rate and can kill nicely at 60-70 meters but its 8 shots on a three round burst and by the time you actually get close to killing someone they jus hide and you gotta start all over again also there is no actual zoom in scope unless you have a perk so unless you ave played alot and practiced good luck sniping. 7.Driving drops frame rate by a couple frames dosn't sound to bad right well good luck drifting when the server lags and you hit a wall and flip or drving to fast and smack another car into a wall and it blows up and you and when the game goes back to normal after like 10 seconds you gotta spawn again while the enemy is so close to their objective and you now gotta drive there again. Luckily it spawns you close but once you spawn the enemy runs you over. 8. social is ok not many people talk ♥♥♥♥ anymore most are friendly and alot of people when you annouce your buying something will give you it for free I know this should be in a con but unless you have a good computer i mean like the movie avatar graphics good it will look pixellated like the first mario game and blurry so seeing that beautiful tattoo you just put on or the awesome looking car you made with all the designs wont be worth it cause it looks like ♥♥♥♥ toyou and everyone alomost everyone gets to see your work while to you it looks like your driving a car that was freashly painted put through a mushroom kingdom car wash then bowser ♥♥♥♥ it out and i mean the first mario mushroom kingdom. 9. Matches are one sided escpecially in Fight club cause the aimbotters and their followers(friendlys who keep around them or the ones that play legitly) Just cmp the spawns unless your team can do it first. Its a good way to earn money and joker tickets but not worth the high blood pressure anger and the 3,000+ computer you bought to play the game with good grphics just to see that awesome design on your car that you just broke and punched the monitor off the desk. Yes i tired all the grphic settings. Also most settings in game unless your computer is the best ever made will cause low framerate and stutters and poorperformance no matter what its best to turn them off but only a few will keep it stable. This guy on youtube thought me that one his NAME is Ouchmaker check him out. 10. Trolls. There are so many. remember that beautiful car you just bought and designed? Well say goodbye cause that ♥♥♥♥ is going bye bye if you get hit and smacked into a wall by a player driving a garbage truck adump truck cement truck or bank truck or just hitting you with great speed with a muscle car. Oh but its alright you can just spawn a new one you better hope you have the cash. 11. Money making is one sided unless your high level player with ♥♥♥♥ unlocked or you might as well just play as a crim which is what most people play as so just dont bother playing as a n enforcer unless you have another character you can mail stuff to that has ♥♥♥♥ unlocked. Making money as enforcer is hard when your a new player and dot bother looking for help or look for tutorials in game cause that ♥♥♥♥ is as useful as a rock on a deserted island with nothing but sand. All its there for is to help you unlock things and most of them wont help you in battle or anywhere only a few maybe. If your looking to play this game and get rich as donald trump then just play as a crim they are about the same anyway. I you lay as enforcer and want money you better have premeium for a good while cause until you unlock a stun gun cause thats how make arrest and thats a good way to earn cash but other than that and bringing in stolen cars or stopping ram raiders then its not worth it cause 2 outaa those 3 things you have to do battle. Which is completely bugged and glitchy.  All in all it's a good game with alot of potential and if it didnt fail at start it wouldnt be the way it is now it would probably surpass GTA 5 or Elder Scrolls: Online I bought this game not to long after it was released and I couldnt play it ( i didnt know the servers went down and tht the company went bankrupt) As much as I hate the problems and hate it for being pretty much abannded cause the current game devs havent fixed anything the first patch I saw was 1.16 and that dropped my framrate some and now 1.17 is out and its dropped even more but atleast they got the anti-cheating system working fully although you get banned you can retry again later but you get banned imediately which is good cause if people finally say fine i will turn off my chest then they can ply again instead of being permabanned although im sure if this is true I saw a player retry after many times using different character names so i dont know if only his character were banned permabanned or what but he kept trying. So if you wanna try it go ahead it is the experience i wouldn't call it home cause im not a huge MMO player I like RTs but this game has a place and always will due to when it first came out for now i'll play it and when it finally shuts down which probably will unless people come back and try it again then I will miss it dearly and it will still be in the History books and hall of fame as the game with the #1 ranked customization to this date unless its been beat lready but even then it still holds the highest record for holding this title. No game can beat the customization that i have played. And dont let people trick you people may talk ♥♥♥♥ but its not serious stuff unless he's being a ♥♥♥♥ then everyone will jump on his case everyone is friendly even apposing factions it has it occastional ♥♥♥♥ but its not like call of duty where everyone is saying ♥♥♥♥er ♥♥♥♥ slut ♥♥♥♥ sucker and other trash talk. You will hear alot of hackusations but that should stop now. My rating is 6/10 its good and if your heart feels up to it try it you do get three days of free premeium after signing up and logging into the game os check or email after and there is a free 'lone ranger' mask too in for you. With the preminum you'll be able to expericence the world and customization 100% and with the money you earn of xp you also get a preminum bonus. Well I hope this help you in deciding Theres alot of cons yes but right now its wait and see if it will rise up or just continue its slow pace into failing. but if you decide not to play it atleast keep an eye on the game and check up on it theres also was and also it never hurts.
5940	1	a	Best F2P shooter, despite the ongoing server issues and the 'youthful spirited' community.
5942	1	a	wow, i have not played anything so bad in my life.. soooooo not coool. terrible physics
5944	1	a	Awesome game really fun
5946	1	a	boss 
5948	1	a	Giant Bilbo Baggins Mess up 
5950	1	a	awsome game
5952	1	a	PAY2WIN game...would be good if not for that.
5954	1	a	this is a nail bitting action game   that uses all the computing ability of your sytem to make an experience in  gaming that will not be surpased in decades..
5956	1	a	A great game.  9/10 Arma is too expensive!
5958	1	a	boss
5960	1	a	it's good. for a free to play game.
5962	1	a	Played it and I really enjoy playing it with friends, however I wish there was more to do.
5964	1	a	You Want a cool looking avatar you need to spen at least three hours on it. you want a cool car 5 hours plus some money. you want to win? you either give up your life savings or your whole life
5966	1	a	I drove a car, exploded, then respawned and got ran over by a dude playing mylie cyrius, i came in like a wrecking ball. 11 out of 10, would be explode again.
5968	1	a	i liked it just you have to buy weps with real money if you wanna keep them
5970	1	a	APB Reloaded challenges players into wild streets of San Paro. Brings them into a hard fight between the good and evil...The question is which one of the two forces are good or evil? But at all APB Reloaded can be a great game for people who want to personalize and customize EVERYTHING they have. My score to APB is 10/10
5972	1	a	APB Reloaded is a great game if you are into that kind of mission type, open world crime games. As great as it looks, it also has those good immersive team co-op type missions as well. Along with:  Graphics: 9.5/10 I have seen better, but it is a great game for this section. I would have to turn it down a few notches but it still looks fine.  Sound: 10/10 Ahhh... the San Paro ambiant sounds. The citizens are screaming, the distant rivalry gunshots are whizzing past me. How better can it be? Well, it would be better if I still had my ear. I take that back. I hate the gunshots. Darn that city.  Gameplay: 7/10 The gameplay is really based on the latency, which also depends which district you are on. But generally, it's kinda bad. I mean, assuming you have obsticals, The fences seem like you are basically superman, flying over them like they're nothing. Plus we got the ladders. Going up, sometimes you won't reach the top. Sometimes you'll fall right off. Also, Going down, you'll lose stamina if you decide to be lazy, in this case, escape your enemy. And if you go around a corner, you'll still die due to that last bullet. EVEN THOUGH it MISSES YOU ENTIRELY! But hey, this is in early stages. and will get developed.  Replay value: na/na There is no end to this game.  Overall value: 8.75 I would reccomend this to people on certain circumstances. It's fun. I do like this game and would spend 3 hours or more in one session.     
5974	1	a	Good game, but alot of hackers/cheaters and lag(may be different for other people).
5976	1	a	custimization alone makes the game amazing
5978	1	a	Can you please make it for Mac i would like that :)  Thanks.
5980	1	a	I've been playing APB since original RTW Beta/EarlyAccess. It has remained one of my all time favorite games.  There are a number of issues with the game (repetitive at times, some hackers here and there, not a very friendly community) but in my opinion it still has a lot to offer when it comes to being a fun game.  For the most part, the game is F2P, but there is a marketplace (microtransactions) that allows purchasing of in-game guns and vehicles, clothing, etc. Though, please take to mind that this game is in no way Pay2Win. The guns/vehicles offered in the marketplace are mostly permanent/re-meshed(re-skinned) versions of the same weapons obtainable in-game. The one exception is the legendary reward from their Joker Mystery Boxes which offers a unique gun in both aesthetics and functionality, but the weapons are still not P2W and just offer a different play style.  If you find your place in the community, you can easily find yourself playing this game for years, I know I have. I've also spent hundreds of dollars on the marketplace (Buying many of the permanent versions of the weapons, but mostly 'gambling' with the Joker Mystery Boxes for a chance at the legendary weapons.) It's also a lot of fun when you play with IRL friends, family or your girlfriend/fiancee/wife (as I do).  Overall, I'd rate this game a 4.7/5. It's not perfect, but it's a damn good game. If you ever find yourself on Joker (NA East), look me up if you'd like to chat or play around (Enforcer is Neonis, Criminals are Rozial and Sorley). I'm not the best (still Gold threat though ^-^;), but I can help out any new players with advice and guidance.
5982	1	a	Can draw a ♥♥♥♥♥ on my shirt and wear it.  10/10 will ♥♥♥♥♥ again.
5984	1	a	A very fun game to play with your friends but i feel like its more of a pay to win game but then again its free so i consider trying it.
5986	1	a	The graphic is cool, the gameplay is pretty good. It has a lot of misson and objectives for you to play so you won't be roaming around feeling bored. I enjoyed playing it, i actually played this for 11 hours straight with constant pause. You get to change the look of your character in a part of the world ( I didn't play this for months while i'm writing this. :D) You can meet tons of players online and co-op with them, kill bad guys or being the bad guys. This is a game that's gonna give you a lot of fun hours. Wouldn't say this is my favorite but this is very very good.  8/10 for rating.
5988	1	a	This is the best free to play game I have played in a very long time.  
5990	1	a	i never playd this game yet any way so i am gonna try it out and meyby i'll make this public so you guys can find it :D :D
5992	1	a	this game is swag
5994	1	a	i havent played this game in ages but it was fun then now sure about now
5996	1	a	Great Game! Only there is 3 problems. 1 The Guns Are NOT permenent buys in game!This is bad for a Number of reasons such as getting stuck with 1 gun forever and getting in a killstreak for someone who bought stuff for real money! Next Flaw is cars! Because it takes numerous hours of framing to get 1 car that only looks good that you could probebley steal! Final Flaw Is Player Base! This game relies on that way to much! One Time I Was Playing as a cop and could not get in a Mission Untill like 5 or 6 Criminals Got in and i had to be the oposition! Overall the game is a solid 7/10 and i think it is really good.Also If You Want To See Me Play This Go To My Youtube Channel It Is Captain Narwhal!
5998	1	a	I would recommend this game because it's pretty. And it has lots of girls in skimpy outfits :)
6000	1	a	it is a great game you just gotta have a good computer to play it
6002	1	a	I LOVE this game it is like gta. u are a bad or good. it is up to u( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
6004	1	a	The most toxic and pay to win game i have ever played. Step one start the game, Step 2, try to talk to anyone and get called names and listen to little kids rage about (not spending birthday money on a game or run around with autoaimbots and speed hacks and blah blah blah) not winning a match.   This game tried to be what grand theft auto is and failed, and twice as toxic. the only reason i am rating this game so high is to get this viewed. In no way do i recomend this game to anyone, if you want to play grandtheftauto you should
6006	1	a	Its okay i guess, people still complain about pay to win but its not that bad. Colby needs more players, Joker is apparently larger from my understanding. This game has amazing cosplay/RP options though.
6008	1	a	a fun game to play with a friends
6010	1	a	its a great game lol
6012	1	a	The best part of APB is never knowing what you're doing. Oh and getting spawn camped.
6014	1	a	It is so fun that I keep creating new accounts so I can have endless fun. As a Enforcer you drive a car called Jericho. As a Criminal you can drive a car called Rapier. I highly recommend this game.
6016	1	a	it's so good games  
6018	1	a	Third-Person-Shooter-MMO-Car-Driving-Simulator-Thingy. OK Game. CAUTION: Money eating machine and luck based missions!
6020	1	a	This game is one of the best games i have ever played, and it reminds me a bit like GTA. I strongly Recommend this game.
6022	1	a	this is the best game yet and it's free so that is really good but it's the best 
6024	1	a	Great to play unless you have slow wifi because it will be laggy as hell
6026	1	a	I'm going to go over my experience with this game during this review. When I first started playing and I was new to the game, I had the most fun I'd had in a long time. Just driving around town mowing down civilians (even though I was a cop) and losing all of my prestige was fun enough. I've always liked the idea of an open world city where players were free to do whatever they want and go into missions whenever you felt like it. The main thing that set this game apart from other shooters was that instead of a list of servers, you get a city and you're free to join a mission whenever you'd like.   The customization in this game is amazing. You can create your own decals to put on clothing and cars. The main issue that I have is the work and time you have to put into the game to unlock good cars, upgrades, guns, and clothing. An easier way to get these things would be to buy them with real money, which I find that many users do to have the advantage over new players. That brings me to my next point.   If you are just getting into the game, you're screwed. Simple as that. You will get your butt handed to you each time you play unless you gather a team of newbs or join more experienced players. After a while you will develop strategies and get better unlocks. If you don't have a high-end computer, you're also screwed.   To finish off this review, the game has potential. Does the game show that often? No. The game needs more updates and the missions get old. The NPCs all act basically the same and after a while, you get bored. The reason that I recommend this game is because I've spent countless hours playing this game and I've had a lot of fun with it for a free-to-play. I say it's worth checking out. I feel like there are better updates to come.  Thanks for reading
6028	1	a	:)
6030	1	a	i like this game because is funny with a friends
6032	1	a	Great character creation and artwork. Strangely addicting gameplay.
6034	1	a	GTA-like MMO with a bit of an RPG vibe in it, you can unlock weapons, modifications, new vehicles, new NPCs etc. You can fully customize your character, clothing, vehicles with artwork you've unlocked or created on your own. You can also take on up to 100 fully customized players in each district.   All Points Bulletin: Reloaded is Free2Play done right.   
6036	1	a	♥♥♥♥ this games 
6038	1	a	Looking for a new fps to play I stumbled across APB. I touched the game once before but never gave it a fair chance, this time around I fell inlove quickly. I played Socom Navy Seals a lot so I instantly felt at home with the over the shoulder combat. Typically games with a lot of options or activities do them all average at best.. However APB isn't one of those games. The driving/cars feel smooth and have balance of it's own.. The fps combat is a blast and really well rounded... finally the car/character customization is to die for. I've never had so much fun making my character and belongings feel like mine in a game. Being a f2p game there is a large $cash$ shop, but it's nothing ground breaking... everything you can buy feels fair and doesn't give anyone a huge advantage.   Skill&gt;$$ 
6040	1	a	I like to describe this game as 'Multiplayer Grand Theft Auto'. You're in a large scale city environment with traffic, NPCs, and other characters, and its third person shooter style. The storyline behind the game makes it somewhat believable: the city has deteriorated and crime is rampant, in a last ditch effort to save the city the mayor deputizes anyone who wants to help enforce laws, thus the creation the two major factions enforcers and criminals. Characters are grouped (typically groups of 2-4 or up to 8 if you call in backup) to help each other with missions that are assigned by a dispatcher depending on their faction. You can create your own groups with friends or be auto grouped. There will usually be around 80-100 people running around on any particular server, and dozens of servers, so you get to find a wide range of different people and skills. The missions fit well with the back story (eg, enforcers have to raid doors and crims have to stop raids, etc; criminals have to spray graffiti and enforcers have to stop graffiti, etc) but do lack some depth and can be repetitive.  Another good aspect of the game is the visual customization for clothing and vehicles. With an in-game mini graphics designer, its possible to create almost any design for your vehicle or clothing.  The game can be very addictive and has lots of continual play value as you constantly unlock weapons, vehicles, and perks.
6042	1	a	i love this game, its just like gta but free :D  i dont know why people would hate this game ughh.  
6044	1	a	Like Grand Theft Auto, but like Team Fortress at the same time!
6046	1	a	Very smooth and top free game. Love all the gameplay and the 'cop vs robbers' idea.
6048	1	a	This Game is a game kinda like GTA5 i like it u can coustmise your cars and u can mug people but i wanna see it be to where u can robb stores 
6050	1	a	I want to play this game so bad but the thing this game seems to break your computer giving you blue screen which made my old computer die off even though it exceeded the req
6052	1	a	the game is awsome to play/ enjoy butr please note that the games min/recomended requirements are severly out of date you pretty much need a high end machine just tobe able to play the game and thats despite it being unstable on its own 
6054	1	a	Pretty much GTA but you can enforse the law too but still awesome
6056	1	a	cool game
6058	1	a	very good. sometimes the matchmaker is unfair but its fine
6060	1	a	Good game, but the resolution needs to be lower?! the game is too laggy, this can put off players that have been there for long, ive been there since open beta and back then it was not high resolution, no bullsh*t or hackers, why cant APB go back to low resolution again?
6062	1	a	good 3D grafics! i will give this game 6 stars!
6064	1	a	Basically a free version of GTA. Maybe good if you want to crash into some buildings, take a T.V and die from how slow you walk. Yeahh... its the best thing ever apperantly.
6066	1	a	Amazing game. Newies have a hard driving fast cars ut its amazing
6068	1	a	The Pros: Massive customization (Logos, Music, Character, Cars, Weapons) The Cons: Poor connection, bad and broken hitboxes, high cheater presence, bad matchmaking (a level one can be setup against a level 50 and so on) For the most part APB runs fine, connects fine and you have to be in a certain mood to enjoy the game, first time players may not enjoy it.
6070	1	a	Good game,but need a strong computer :) I hasn't it.. :( but I working for it :))
6072	1	a	I highly recommend this game, is a very good multiplayer game, and are Free to Play! :D
6074	1	a	APB sucked but no that another company took over and made it better.
6076	1	a	Excellent Graphics, Interesting Concept, Hard to learn Gameplay. The gameplay for me is quite confusing and even after as much as I have played it, I mainly just get killed. I don't know if it just me but definitely give the game a try as it can be quite entertaining if you learn to play.
6078	1	a	Good but wouldnt lauch somtimes but a good game
6080	1	a	The most chaotic, fast paced, skill based MMOs I've ever played...and it's free!
6082	1	a	I would give this game a definite 9.5/10. The character customization is ridculously in-depth. Although you can't have exact hairstyles, the game allows for a wide array of customizations to the hairs that are in the game, so it's not that big of a deal. Another great thing that the customization offers is the ability to truly modify characteristics. What this means is that you can angle your eyes, close or open your eyelids more or less, change your lip size, change your chin height and detail - a lot of in-depth customization that a lot of other games don't have, which is very nice. Not only does APB Reloaded have very detailed character customization, but it also allows for highly customizable clothing which is another excellent customization feature that a lot of games don't necessarily have. Saints Row IV had something to the same effect, but it feels as though APB Reloaded has a much wider possiblity for freeforming your own character in his/her own style.  Gameplay wise, the gameplay is relatively smooth. It sucks to start off the game as a weak player who gets blown up by an RPG, or shot to death by a shotgun at close range, but the mechanics aren't terribly difficult to learn. My one gripe with controls and gameplay is that driving is an issue when you first start out. Unless you buy a car, your handling will be the equivalant of not driving at all.  Chat functionalityis high; the ability to moderate your clan, your group, and chat all in one is a great, typical feature. My issue with the chat is that it's not very clear as to how to switch between chats. /help didn't tell me how to change between chats. You have to instinctively know that it's not a hotkey. Instead, you just type '/' and then the name of the group you want to talk to. For example '/district'.  Overall, awesome game. There were a few things that I didn't like that are mentioned above, but I still can't rate it below 9.5. It does seem like a game that demands you pay real money, but the free customization that I've seen so far is quite vast that it actually doesn't seem all too necessary.
6084	1	a	So Good Not So bad I am used to play it and its good But PLS add motorcycles PLS
6086	1	a	this game is just like gta its awsome.
6088	1	a	Good game, but weapon stats in game really sucks
6090	1	a	I think this game is great, the custimization is so fun and it really lets you play how you want to play. With the right people or placements, you can take anyone down, even if they spent $3000 on weapons and armour and guns and you only have 1 hour played, you can still take them down easily. Hackers really are not much of a problem if you take the time and think through a plan and then strike, they can only kill as fast as you. With freinds you can actually feel like a real ganster and screw people up without actually ruining society. 8/10 good game. They could of done better on some things...
6092	1	a	Great co-op Grand Theft Auto. But bloody hardware requirements... :(
6094	1	a	go game laggy tho 
6096	1	a	APB RELOADED is one of the best online multiplayer game i have ever played! This game is manely fun with your freinds but dont let that stop you from getting this game, the game is still fun without friends all im saying is when you are playing with friends on this game you pee yourself in laughter even more than you do on your own playing this game. I like how you can creat and customize your charecter and make yourself look like a complete BADASS, also you can even customize your own car to make just as equally as BADASS as your charecter. You get a choice of being a Emfocer or a crimanal, you can pick diffrent districs and locations to spawn at and also you can even make your own group or join a group. There is so much good things to say about this game but i will just end it with this.......of the few hours i have been playing this game i have fell in love with it i like this game more than anyother game i own or have now. WARNING THIS GAME MAY BECOME ADDICTIVE!
6098	1	a	I Love This Game I Watched My BRO! Play This Now I Play This And Love! It :D 10/10 :D
6100	1	a	I GOT SO ADDICTED TO THIS GAME!!!! IT'S AWESOME!!!
6102	1	a	This game is soo much fun, although there are stuff that could be fix to make it alot better but of course still is fun to play with friends and make friends also!
6104	1	a	haven't played it yet still downloading though..... sounds fun^.^
6106	1	a	lags a lot but it is still fun. Its worth trying. 
6108	1	a	This game is a good, third person action, explorer shooter. I think its kinda wierd its free, it has a personality like Grand theft auto and better on screen graphics then the fourth one.  Personally, I would highly recommend this game to all Steam users. It has content which you may eventually get bored of, but its fun.
6110	1	a	it is an ausome game trust me get is stay with it 
6112	1	a	This Game Has Customization, Cars, Freindly People, RPers, And Most Of All, GUNS. GunsGunsGuns!!      WHAT THE HECK ARE YOU WAITING FOR!?!
6114	1	a	its game good 
6116	1	a	This game is AWESOME, been playing it for almost a year now. Ppl who read this. DOWNLOAD AND PLAY IT! :D
6118	1	a	Do you like spending real money over and over agian on the same game? Well this one is for YOU!! Friends are needed to play and have fun IMO, being the cops can be quite dull most times, and the crooks are ballin. The power of the darkside is everywhere, no one should be able to survive. He runs the underworld with a deathly fist. Why you ask, because it's raining .... raining upon my teary eyed face with no way to tell if you are Dead or Alive?!
6120	1	a	very good 4 a f2p game
6122	1	a	Great game.
6124	1	a	It has potential, but my computer isn't good at running it. It's an open multiplayer GTA. Definitely check it out if you're into the genre.
6126	1	a	I have ALOT, and I mean ALOT of problems with this game, but it's a very awesome game! I reccomend getting it, but be preparred for all the issues with it
6128	1	a	What use to be an amazing game that is now Pay To Win , Pay To Play has turned this game from amazing to not so good. New Players Be Warned most people you will play with will probably have better stuff then you because they bought it, They have taken out alot on the free to play model such as fashionista skill and more. Fun to play some times but not as good as it use to be RTW Was amazing, G1 has ruined it.
6130	1	a	Nice game! Nice Graphic!  i wish the new update was Racing Map,new cars,new guns!
6132	1	a	APB Reloaded, is almost like GTA from my point of view. its awesome cuz you can mug people, and ramraid stores. ( u cant in GTA). it takes ca 3 hours to get it installed ( took 4 hours for me) but its worth it!. Thumbs up
6134	1	a	
6136	1	a	APB was perfect game... and please really please update system requirenments of game because i cant play this game on minimum settings.... and i pass all rewuirenments.... but before 2 years i was playing on medium settings... but now it is unplayable game is very hardware echausting.... i have E3400 2.6GHZ dualcore, 4GB RAM, gt 630 2GB ddr3 and i have 25FPS it is perfect...
6138	1	a	There has to be 10,000+ more things to do. I started a long time ago and still havent finished, Customize Vehicles and yourself, You can pick 1 side, theres 2, Thug or Police Choose your fate, grab your gun.
6140	1	a	I've played this game for thousands of hours, but i had the luck to start playing during the closed beta, whene everyone sucked.   Now the game's learning curve is much higher because of the experienced players you have to fight as a newbie. A solution would be to go on the forums and find people that want to help you and explain the game to you. Don't worry, there are plenty of people out there willing to help you.  Also ignore the people in the comments saying that the game is p2w, some weapons you pay for do indeed have an advantage, such as the sniper you can run with. But the downside of this sniper is that it only does 55% damage instead of 85% with the regular sniper. So ignore these trolls bashing the game and just try it ^^
6142	1	a	This vidya gaems man
6144	1	a	'The best part of this game is not just the shooting and guarding the objective.' The best part of this game is that god gaben made the uninstall button as bright as the game and easy to find than finding a bloody opponent    see the 2.2 hour i wasted on that game? it takes that long to be diagnosed with brain cancer   
6146	1	a	It could be a great game if it was payed attention to more. In it's current state,I reccommend it. Only slightly however,as there are many cheaters,and it is rather laggy. speaking of which,i reccommend playing this on really good computer to spare you the trouble. It does have the pay to win aesthetic,but I love my guns anyway. Complete some tutorials and you can get a permanent weapon,and I love my rifle. If I had to give it a rating,I would say....7.5/10. It could be great,but it is sadly ignored by developers like that old carton of curtled milk probably in the back of your fridge.
6148	1	a	Grand Theft Auto: Global Offensive If you are that type of person that rages all the time.. dont play this game
6150	1	a	Seems like a cheap( or even free) version of GTA but thrust me, there is more to it than that. Its also very fun to play with friends.
6152	1	a	Try it. No, Don't tell me, No. Shut up. Try this game. Try it.
6154	1	a	played this and having much fun, massively addicting and its a five star for this game, although its still in the progress of improvement , it served me just nice XD
6156	1	a	is cool
6158	1	a	♥♥♥♥♥♥, terrible service plauged my experience with this game, do NOT get it.
6160	1	a	Got killed by car falling from the sky, 30/10.
6162	1	a	robberies criminals and chase? this is the best game!
6164	1	a	Its fun
6166	1	a	LUV this game as GTA 
6168	1	a	lot of fun great for groups
6170	1	a	Totally worth it if you love open world and fully customizable MMOs. But how can you love something you've never seen before? APB pioneered this level of gaming, check it out if you dare. ;)
6172	1	a	i dont even know what this game is and i played it for 30 minutes
6174	1	a	Very interesting game. A kind of f2p GTA if you would. The only problems I have is the game is f2p but pay to win, basically meaning if you put 20 bucks into the game, you win. The other problem is any kind of lag makes this game almost completly un -playable. But in the end, for what it is, its a great game.
6176	1	a	This game is actually really fun once you get past the steep learning curve. It will put you through hell in the start but once you get used to it things do get a lot better. The only downside is the hackers that run around but they are rare to run into. Just play for fun and and all is well.  I have to edit this review because although it can be a fun game, and it's not necessarily a bad game, this game is dated. There's supposedly going to be an engine upgrade and it seems like it's never coming but it's suppose to be soon. And with that, more bugs! The few things this game lacks is innovation and optimization. Match making is terrible, guns are hardley ever balanced and servers are still not up to par.  I'm still recommending this game for those wishing to play something with a GTA Online feel that's free to play.
6178	1	a	great game, i hardly play it...
6180	1	a	I loved this game in my past account, would really reccomend it if you like games like Grand Theft Auto and the TPS (Third Person Shooter) genre. For it is a mix of it.
6182	1	a	Why did you download an open source steam game?? If you havent downloaded this yet, why are you thinking to do it??
6184	1	a	I'm McLovin this games ! Once. Been a long while since I login. Gettin n00b. I will be back. Much customization in games and fun gameplay. One of the best customize I ever encounter. Need a good teamwork or frens to truly enjoy the games though.
6186	1	a	This is a great game to play. It is an urban 3rd person shooter game that is an MMO Co-Op version Grand Theft Auto. It has a MMO RPG like system built into the game with progression, levels trading, ect. Tons of customizations to cars, clothing, weapons and charactors. The only issues with the game though are the expensive items and upgrades. Maintaining a lease on the weapons gets very expensive for pure free to play players. I highly reccommend that serious players go pay to play and get a perma weapon and side arm they always use. Also, the general community is poor and very trollish. If you can ignore the bad sides and stick to a good team of friends, it will be a fun game for you to play.
6188	1	a	Pay to use the good weapons. They banned me when they started up after Realtime Worlds tanked. It was much better when RTW was in control.
6190	1	a	I shot someone for stealing and they screamed 8/10
6192	1	a	Pretty darn fun.  It has it's pay to win attributes, but it all can be grinded out without putting money into it. There are quite a few cheaters, but they can easily be outplayed.
6194	1	a	Worst game ever never will play this game ever again.   10/10 ~jesus games
6196	1	a	Eh . It's a good game , i playing daily , from now :D
6198	1	a	I love this game and I find it to be very fun. I enjoy the customazation of your character and cars and just everything about the option to make your own design and place it on whaterever. I don't like the gun system mostly because i feel like it's pay to win because you can pay to unlock a strong weapon forever while people who can't or don't pay have a harder time because they have to unlock the gun the pay for it just for it to go away in a week and I don't want to pay a crazy ammount for the gun then have to save up for a week to get it again and not be able to buy anything else.   Overall I enjoy the game but I feel like it's pay to win sadly.
6200	1	a	This game is fun with friends. With good teamwork you can defeat the people paying for this game easily.
6202	1	a	Its a really fun game, u can play as a cop or criminal, I perfer criminals
6204	1	a	APB is very fun its kinda like Gta mixed cops and robbers and car chases but it as its limits once you rasie a mentor to level 10 and get the clothes you want your pretty much done with the game its really fun when you play with your friends it also has a free roam around city there are 2 diffrent cites and a social area for changing your clothes i think they could of made this game a little better and give it more free stuff to do in the city I rate this game out of 10 7/10
6206	1	a	Love it 
6208	1	a	For some reason I quite enjoy this game. Except for the lag. That makes me want to stab kittens.
6210	1	a	This game is a fast-paced awesome MULTIPLAYER game. The multiplayer is captilized because that is the huge fault of this game, when your waiting for players this is the worst game but when you have at least 4 people on a server it's an insanely fun game. WARNING: It has a steepish learning curve (use the internet for tutorials)
6212	1	a	This game hits a 9/10 very easily. Can't stop playing it !!  A mix of GTA and Brink as an MMO. You can customize everything about everything about you. Your charator, your cars, your guns (if Premium), music playing while your in your car or close-by and even your death-song where every player that is killed by you hears your personal death-song!  A game where the 2 factions (Enforcers and Criminal) fight for the streets of San Paro. You team up (either Pug or not) with players to acomplish missions against the other faction. There is 100s of different games and missions. Missions sush as spraying walls of the streets, hacking antennas, steal a car and drive it to it's destination, defend Vips while kill the opposing team, loot specific key objects, capture areas and defend them for points and of course Deathmatch games. All in 2 giant parts of the City (The Waterfront and the Financial districts). Everything is live!! So you might be on a mission with your team while another team is on another mission on the other side of the street.  So much more to do as you play as a Criminal like doing a raid on a shop or mugging people on the street for their valued stuff to then steal itand bring it back to a drop-off point, Grand theft an expensive vehicule and drive it to a garage for $$. But careful not to be witnessed by an Enforcer who may take you down and bring any thing you stole to a place to gain equal $$ of the stuff you stole.
6214	1	a	This game is amazing it is like a smaller version of GTA 5 for people who don't have it or any consoles but still GTA 5 is better this is a small way of GTA 5 on PC
6216	1	a	Try this if you allready haven't!!! :D
6218	1	a	my ram are 2 gb but i play it normally with some lags of course but what does out of memore mean ? when i play it for a while it crash then give me a error called out of memory can someone help me with that
6220	1	a	This game is one of the best mmo games in my opinion. It's a third person shooter in the great city of San Paro. This game includes so much customization. You can tune your car, buy some clothes and make music and share it all. You can choose between an enforcer and a criminal with both their own gameplay elements. You can choose various guns out of a huge arsenal of weapons. This game is also free, so don't doubt to download this beauty and try it out yourself.

6254	1	a	This game is awesome. Play it while you can though, the population is slowly dieing, on my server joker east it is like 800 or 600 at day. A year or 2 ago it was about 1k or 1.5k people or more. If you like GTA then you will like this game alot. However there are tons of bugs on the game and the devs ♥♥♥♥ up alot and create more by trying to add stuff into the game that is not needed. I warn you if you play this game be prepared to rage.
6256	1	a	i dont care about the rating or other reviews. this game is what i'd call the second gta 5 online. its great and its for the computer which i'd call a cool game so argue all u want about this i still say this needs more people
6258	1	a	Awesome game. MMO version of Grand Theft Auto.

6262	1	a	♥♥♥♥ this game. I need a life.
6264	1	a	This game is all an MMOTPS game should be, but without the lack of teamwork and need of high-spec computers =T This game is all a player could want to do in a city run by Cops and Crooks This game, is the deffinition of grinding F2P games with a metric sh** ton of fun This game... Is APB Reloaded In a city where earning your money is practically limitless, go around in your fancy civilian cars and start robbing stores, mugging people and doing gang missions, or, if you want to be with the popo (easier life basically, and kind of overpowered weaponry, so boo to you coppers!) return stolen vehicles, lock up crooks, help the civilians and go on missions to try and subdue the ever increasing force of the Criminals. The game offers a variety of weapons and vehicles, the only bad thing that many players will hate - to get them, you either need over $15,000,000,000 on the auction house (good luck playing this game for 2 years straight!) or Micro Transactions. Now you may have stopped reading, but with this games content level, you may think twice. With the bonuses that you get from buying these, you will quickly climb your ladder to fame amongst your people. (the only thing I think they should add are cribs, like in GTA, plan group robberies n shi*) So if you like to play with other people in a constantly hostile environment, with a lot of content, playability, shi* ton of customization and players, then this badass MMOTPS that will literally make computers that can't run this game explode into a million pieces of white hot metal from running this, is the game for you  P.S. For all new players, I suggest you rob stores with your vehicle and then drop off your loot to your assigned leader to get dirty money, but make sure to kill around 50 civilians to make your multiplier x4 so when you drop off your dirty money, you get 4x the amount of dirty money you had, and with that, buy a van, really useful ^-^
6266	1	a	pew pew pew..pow pow pow.. shoot here.. shoot there.. become criminal. or become an enforcer. Kinda fun.. especially when have friends to cover your back..
6268	1	a	I really good PvP MMO but the vehicle controls are crap...  It feels like you are driving a boat not a car :(
6270	1	a	This game is really good in my opinion I havent played the game properly you know but its still a realy good game and very fun. very customizable.
6272	1	a	Have been playing APB: Reloaded since closed beta. One of my favorite third person shooters out there. Good fun if you play with a friend, or a team, but can be tough by yourself. Steep learning curve for new players, and takes many hours to get very good at. It's free to play, so I reccomend atleast checking it out, if you hate it, you can always uninstall.
6274	1	a	i find it a lot of fun but i wish i cold tirn of smoke. but its a fun game
6276	1	a	copied watch dogs 10/10 just like my great aunt elizibeth who told me about resident evil 2 what the ♥♥♥♥ am i on about
6278	1	a	Bestsandbox free to play game i have played for a while a must get game
6280	1	a	I'll try to keep this short, from my experience.. I truly believe this game has great potential. The lastest patch has improved the anti-cheat which is great. I haven't seen more than 1 hacker if at all since that patch. One thing I really wish they took into consideration is the civilians. There's little no none penalty for killing them as a Criminal or Enforcer. I mean it'd make sense that as an enforcer, if you see a criminal stealing a car or killing a civilian you could instaltly hit that 'witness' button and arrest/chase them but it was dissapointing to find out that only ram-raiding/mugging people are witnessable crimes. customization = 9/10.  performance = 6/10 hackers since last patch = 1% - 3%  potention = over 9000%  match making fairness = 7/10 ( people had rockets and grenade launchers at times )  One last thing, while playing as a F2P I always felt that I was inferior to those that had the same amount of playtime as me or had a more but not by much ( still killed some of them because skill does not equal to good weapons/items. )  I left my review on yes since it really does have good potential. (P.S I feel like they care more about the market than the game sometimes... greedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.)
6282	1	a	this is nice game
6284	1	a	i think that APB Reloaded was suggested by tearmanator152 which was a perfect game just like Grand Theft Auto's
6286	1	a	great game 100,000,000,000,000 times better than all the gta games download it you will not regret
6288	1	a	yes, this game looks really like gta. but its getting boring after a while! but you should get this game  its really cool
6290	1	a	LOVE THIS GAME , so much fun with friends ! You can customize everything . Hackers are all being tracked down with the new system , hopefully we'll have a new map someday =)
6292	1	a	after playing it for a little bit i have this to say its K but not to K
6294	1	a	The best free to play game on steam. Very fun if you like open world GTA style third person shooters.
6296	1	a	APB Reloaded is a good game to play as criminals/officers. But if you don't want big la you might wanna have a graphics card. I say 6/10, Could get better performance
6298	1	a	Its ok but... IT WONT EVER LOAD FOR ME!!!!!! Im still going to give it a thumbs up becuase i only played 1 min of it and i got scared so i accidently shut it down but what i did do in that first minute was fun.
6300	1	a	gta V PC, but came before the actual gta V pc
6302	1	a	This ♥♥♥♥ is literally ♥♥♥♥ing flawless. Okay well maybe the only flaw is that i wish the map was bigger and there was alot more new content. But you will enjoy this ♥♥♥♥ for a while then come back to it over time. Too bad they're too lazy and understaffed to make new real content. User content can only go so far, although there is plenty of that in this game that anybody can create, even you.
6304	1	a	one simple word AMAZING!!!!
6306	1	a	This is a vary versitile game that can be both fast paced and slow paced at times. The servers are always being worked on which can at time have a negative effect on the gameplay but they never last so long that it becomes an issue for groups. The in-game features are fantastic and G1 is always releaseing new content for purchase.  This game is very graphically demanding and I would recommend making sure that your PC meets the recomended specs before even thinking about dowloading this game. I run an i7 3770k with a 2BG GTX 660 and I get around 100fps. So make sure that you have good gear in your PC.  I very much recommend this game. It's in third-person which is always a nice change to the normal first person shooter games out there. Very fun with friends and I hope they can continue to develop more content for this amazing game. Get it!
6308	1	a	Very addicting, even if it's a bit repetitive. Admittedly it's hard to progress without premium once you get to a certain point, and a lot of the premium weapons are overpowered, but not to the point where you NEED them to do well. Admittedly, I haven't played in over a year, so this may have changed.
6310	1	a	The level of customization is above any other. The only thing they got wrong was switching it from on set price to a pay as you play. Unlimited customization until your character reached a level of complexity that was so high that your computer ran as fast as molassas in december, or only three tattoos and pay for more? The game play is fun, whether you are smashing storefronts and grabbing tv's and stuff from the store or busting the people who are doing that, it's an enjoyable experience. From your shoes to your graphitti and the sound others hear when you kill them it is all customizable. Besides paying for extra stuff and certian customization it is an easy 5 out of 5!
6312	1	a	Bad ♥♥♥ game, I bought it back before it was F2P and still have the CDs. I was a bit ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off it shut down in it's first month of operation. However, still has the problem of cheaters, but if you get stuck with a cheater in a match just run their ♥♥♥ over.
6314	1	a	Great concept. GTA w/ other players. Not executed as one would hope. It is MUCH better than it was when it released, but it still seems P2W and it always seems like someone is hacking.   It is fun to play though, and if you don't sink a bunch of money into it, it can be a fun F2P/P2W game to pass some spare time. And if you do sink money into it, I guess that just makes it all that much better.
6316	1	a	Amazing game , but the only thing i hate in this game it's the OP weapons and off course the 'cheaters .
6318	1	a	idk, i like being able to mug random non player characters on the streets and shoot people in the face.
6320	1	a	game said i had corrupt files. ♥♥♥♥ didnt even work. still looks fun
6322	1	a	10/10 would uninstall again
6324	1	a	JUST THUG LIFE!
6326	1	a	this game is hilarious you can do any thing you want to... also you can choose what thing you want to be... by that I mean that you can either be a criminal or you can be a cop it is clearly your choice... aswell as doing this you can customise your character an way you want to... this game I recommend it is brilliant... well that is what I think at least 
6328	1	a	what a great game to play, great to play with friend, difficult to start playing but once you get used to the game you will become awesome at the game, great online game to recommend friends to play. 10/10
6330	1	a	Very fun game. A must try
6332	1	a	this is the version of GTA. it is holy fun
6334	1	a	This game is GOLD. I mean, i had to cross the street, holding a briefcase, surrounded by explosives, rockets and Enforcers, almost dead, magically dodgeing most of the bullets by pure luck. That was the longest street-crossing i ever had to do in my life. The most epic one, too.
6336	1	a	♥♥♥♥
6338	1	a	Excellent game depending on what day and time of day you play. You basically have to avoid the cheaters to get good matches... If you can manage that, you'll have a blast!
6340	1	a	pay to win but still really fun
6342	1	a	this game sucks 
6344	1	a	play this game 
6346	1	a	Weird combat. still a good game fun to crush and be crushed.
6348	1	a	Easily a great game with amazing customization aspects and gameplay, but unfortunately falls short due to a mediocre matchmaking system. If you're persistent enough to push through the bad parts of the game and play with friends, there is a huge potential for lots of fun to have.
6350	1	a	Definitely a fun game! Even on a crappy computer like mine I still find a lot of joy in this game.
6352	1	a	Like that Fairfight :)
6354	1	a	i recommend this game because it is like grand theft auto
6356	1	a	I recommend!
6358	1	a	alot of fun, can: mug people kill peds kill EVERYTHING rob cars take them in and get money for it
6360	1	a	APD brings back the play 'Cops and Robbers' that you used to play as kid. But it has some issues that may bring some frustration. This game is best, when played with a friend, or in bigger group.
6362	1	a	♥♥♥
6364	1	a	To many cheaters had to leave the game
6366	1	a	pretty good
6368	1	a	The ame is very fun. I can play it every day.
6370	1	a	This game is nothing but good. in my opinion :P
6372	1	a	This game would be gud if it had gta V graphics.
6374	1	a	Though the game gets down right frustrating from the crappy perfomance to the annoying hackers and ignorant heads, to the ones that pay money just to own you... It's just something you can't stop playing even if you want to. I suck at the game but I wanna get better to kick ♥♥♥ lol. 
6376	1	a	Insane open-world multiplayer
6378	1	a	This game is severly underrated. Within my first few hours of playing, I found a group of players to accompany on missions and had a blast. I run the game on medium specs and opted for a smooth framerate. Visually, the game favors my needs of it and has played flawlessly beyond small delays for amassed action on the screen.
6380	1	a	APB Reloaded is a game with a classic setting - cops versus crooks. It is a very fast paced open world shooter. The game is very simple and fairly easy to learn, but like most things, hard to master. When you enter the game you create your charater. You have a lot of customization options. A lot. After that, you will expirience a lot of wierd moments, where you will not know what you are doing. But when you actually grasp the game logic, you will start to have a lot of fun, but again, it does tend to 'punish' those who lose missions. But, the gameplay isn't even close to why the game is so much fun. When you enter the social district, you get to costumize your charater at various kiosks around the map. You can costumize all from your charater, to their clothes and even their car. But then again, you do need to buy premium for further costumization (Premium costs around 15€). When you feel you know your way around the game, you will want to join a clan. Clans in this game don't add much meaning to the game, other than the name, and possibly a clan event here and there. But it is an amazing way to meet new people, to play with. Some clans even tend to have clan colours or even clan clothing. The game does lack weapon balancing (the armas gold weapons are a lot of times a lot better when being hold by a - so called pro) and it does (at times) have a big number of aimbot and wallhack hackers, which ruin the mood. The game servers aren't the best and you do need a good system to play it without fps lags. Also, the people in the game are a lot of times ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and can ruin your mood. Don't let them! The game is a lot of fun once you know what you are doing and the costumization is amazing - one of the best in mmo games. Overall, it is worth a shot.
6382	1	a	Game makes me rage hard. So many hurr durr things are wrong with. I still recommend it tho Its fun with friends.
6384	1	a	Always better with a team.
6386	1	a	why i cant play? when i start the game no loading to show..... please ,someone help me !
6388	1	a	Great game good to play free to play if you want to put some hours into it. Creativity in a game is one of the best parts of this game. The extend you can go with your creativity is so large! And a lott of fun to play with your friends.
6390	1	a	  Its good
6392	1	a	APB Reloaded is the best F2P game but cheater destroy the fair play in critical fights. The cheater can activate and deactivate the cheats in seconds. They switch very fast their 'god mode' because they don´t want to be detected and banned.  The game is a third-person shooter with RPG-like character settings.  At the beginning you have to choose one side - enforcer or criminal, which you can´t change easily. The huge variation of weapons you have are impressive and make fights really tactical and hard. Teamplay is really important in APB but lots of players fight solo - including me.  I´ve learned to fight alone against groups but that was two years ago - Meanwhile, I have forgotten it because the cheaters made me angry and i decide to stop playing APB.  I hope that the developers from APB had a solution to detect cheater, why i started a week ago to play APB.  Let´s hope i´ve made the right choice !  If the cheater problem is solved i can recommend hundred percent APB !!!
6394	1	a	Super fun 2 play like gta 5 but less things 2 do and worse graphics but its free and so funny! 8/10
6396	1	a	Started game. Played as a criminal. Shot every single thing on sight. Profited. Ten out of Ten.  Later played as an enforcer. Shot everything up. Didn't profit. Still Ten out of Ten.  Only issue: People insist on comparing this to Grand Theft Auto, then complain it doesn't 'meet their expectations'.   Solution: Stop comparing it and just enjoy the bloody game.
6398	1	a	game said i had corrupt files. ♥♥♥♥ didnt even work. still looks fun
6400	1	a	Because far out character creation, actual teamplay, and shooting stuff.
6402	1	a	there were several bugs, but now its awesome! :3  cool with friends
6404	1	a	This game used to be an ultimate battle of Good vs. Bad. When it first came out, you would log into a world of chaos as criminals and enforcers were shooting, driving, looting, and running everywhere. The experience of logging in and knowing what was awaiting me was a thrill. When it became free to play, I returned to it and had the same excitement going in. Now, it seems the game has begun its decline. You have to be lucky to find a decent amount of people online and when you do they are mostly criminals. It has basically became an online single player game which makes the missions feel very repetitive. Even though this is a negative I have with the game, I personally dont think it's the game's fault. The game is still fun to play, the missions are fun if you have someone to play them with, and the customization of clothing and vehicles in APB is amazing. If you havent played this game before, I strongly suggest giving it a try.
6406	1	a	its a fun free game like gta with way more customization allowed i recomebd this game to all who like shooters
6408	1	a	10/10 would f*ck sh*t up again.
6410	1	a	A very lousy game, i used to have fun in Apb reloaded but there are hackers everywhere and many of the guns are pay 2 win. With all the p2w players insulting those new ones when they beat them.   Highly recommend it if you are Bill Gates. 10/10
6412	1	a	its sort of fun
6414	1	a	It's good craic
6416	1	a	Not enough guinea pigs
6418	1	a	I've played this game for thousands of hours, but i had the luck to start playing during the closed beta, whene everyone sucked.   Now the game's learning curve is much higher because of the experienced players you have to fight as a newbie. A solution would be to go on the forums and find people that want to help you and explain the game to you. Don't worry, there are plenty of people out there willing to help you.  Also ignore the people in the comments saying that the game is p2w, some weapons you pay for do indeed have an advantage, such as the sniper you can run with. But the downside of this sniper is that it only does 55% damage instead of 85% with the regular sniper. So ignore these trolls bashing the game and just try it ^^
6420	1	a	it ♥♥♥♥ing sucked 10/10
6422	1	a	This game is a great game and really extortionary and have to call this one of best game that have tons of customization to clothes and cars to your own personially weapon and character.But most of the people of play who usually play this game rage and anger because of good players most of the time dominate them and hackers so if you see a hackers report him/her btw so the game could be more funner but they have alot of competitive in this game so be careful and do be caught up in the rage if a person call you a noob or hacker so dont mind them. There just raging which means your too good for them and remember dont hate the games hate the players for someone who try to dislike my review but in my personially opinion i give this game a 8/10. but to all the new player who wanna play a new game and you see this game review is mixed and thinking about playing it or not well all I could personally say is go on youtube and search gameplay of this game and check personally if this is your type of fps game. Well im off to play more apb I hope you become good at the game so you dont get rekt by me also one tip config the setting so you can receive maxmium gameplay performance to see how the game goes. well hope you good luck new players and hope you have fun and not let old players rekt you so if i was you I would see or check for a friend to help me with the game. Hint : press enter to chat and type /d to speak in district /t for team /y to yell and /w and player name and type your message than enter.
6424	1	a	APB: Reloaded can be hard as it is fun! you can die with your friends, your custom car, yourself, as a cop, or as a criminal! The game is amazing!
6426	1	a	This Game i a very fun and enjoyable game. It builds teamwork skillz and you hae fun while doing it
6428	1	a	I love this game
6430	1	a	Make it for mac that would be cool cheers
6432	1	a	Good Game! Be Cop its More Fun...
6434	1	a	Very Nice, if you want a action and character creation game PLAY THIS !
6436	1	a	Easily one of the most exciting games I have played.  Edit: 12/6/2014 Current status of the game is questionable. Until the past week or so, the population on the server I play (Colby) had been down to a mere 150-200. The life of the game really depends on the actions of the devs right now: can they roll out the engine update.  Edit: 7/18/2015 Don't lose your cool in this hot summer heat.
6438	1	a	♥♥♥
6440	1	a	game is very fun with friends, should try it, its a must.
6442	1	a	Amazing game, spent way too long playing it. Had fun everytime though
6444	1	a	Was A Great Game! Yet, Now I Have No Reason To Play It die To GTA V!  Say Thanks To Rockstar!
6446	1	a	I do recommend this game, but beware of the server sided controls or something ( delays of controls )
6448	1	a	4 Years of gameplay and itsnt sucks ! Best game friday friend meets !
6450	1	a	great game for online 
6452	1	a	Wow this game is a great game i feel like this game is like a free to play saints row Deffinetly deserves a thumbs up i would give it 9/10
6454	1	a	Black person sim
6456	1	a	I've played this game a lot and i can't stop, it's just so fun.
6458	1	a	Its like cops and robbers ! accept better!
6460	1	a	This game is amazing its really fun and if your a criminal you can look badass.This is one of my favorite games. The customising is amazing and you can buy it in a market and then customize it or you can buy a customized shirt or something and look cool. Criminal is fun but cops will arrest you if you do ramraiding and mug if they catch you. If your notoriety/prestiege 5 you will have a bounty and anybody can kill you.They have fun missions and cool events like the drug mule. Anyway this game is fun but when your like rank 15 and stuff it is harder and more people will most likely kill you.Cop is fun if you like ending crime you can point a gun to a criminal cuff his hands then point a gun at his head.Im a criminal on the game cause i like being the criminal in games.Overall this game gets a 9/10 it's really fun and you should try it.Thanks for reading my review and i hope you play it bye! 
6462	1	a	Grand Theft Auto: Global Offensive If you are that type of person that rages all the time.. dont play this game
6464	1	a	Seems like a cheap( or even free) version of GTA but thrust me, there is more to it than that. Its also very fun to play with friends.
6466	1	a	Really like the game... the style also... Youre getting another thumb up from me!
6468	1	a	Best game i've seen that lets you choose whether to be a criminal or a enforcer. Its not pay to win, i myself use the starter gun and i get my share of kills. 8/10
6470	1	a	Alright, I'll say it right off, if you want something to just pick up and play and be great at it, this is not for you. It takes practice. Skill can overcome almost anything in this game (Except the serious problem with hackers) If you invest money in it, it can be fantastic, though I have not yet spent a dime on it. Going into this game remember to keep a cool head and communicate with your team, also remember it is a GAME meaning it is here to have fun. So have fun. I personally consider it a canvas. The customization in this game is addictive and delicious. It takes a serious grind to get everything, and I doubt I'll ever make it, but being able to customize to this degree, I think it's well worth while. Plus, who doesn't like killing cops while blasting Hollywood Undead out of your car speakers? Or blasting Five Finger Death Punch's 'Mama's said knock you out' while mopping the floors with some criminals? Either way, the customization is there, and if you like games but never feel like you play as yourself, or the character you want to be, or maybe you're just settling or picking a favorite, in any case, if you want to express yourself, this is for you. If you're reading this recently after I posted you can see my steam profile pic is indeed a modified screenshot from the game. Start it up, guys, be patient and try your best.
6472	1	a	10/10
6474	1	a	This game is fun, but can be harder for newer players since it is mostly B2P, but if you're good with a gun and light on your feet, this is the perfect bloodbath for you. Its also a good idea to swap between the two sides if you have a character on both sides because it can be difficult for many to get used to having less on one character than another.
6476	1	a	Just got this game today, man it's amazing. The only downside is the mechanics, shooting is a little bit weird but you'll get used to it. I recommend this game for people who have groups of friends willing too play, playing by yourself is boring.
6478	1	a	Its Ok , but you really need high system requirements because you will lag a lot
6480	1	a	Awesome game, funny to play, good staff , mixed things to do 10/10 ;)
6482	1	a	this is a awesome game 
6484	1	a	THIS GAME IS GANGSTER
6486	1	a	Now then, this game looks great. I love the look of the customisation process of everything it looks soo sweet but there's one issue...I cant get past the launch screen it just finneshes a download and dousn't offer me to start it can someone help please?? PS i dont know if i can reccomend this game or not because i havn't acctually played it yet so just because it looks good i'll reccomend it
6488	1	a	
6490	1	a	Interesting game, just needs more players and a little less money greedy for game-play. 
6492	1	a	okay so... this game it's really hard on new players but if you have the time and the patience for this game you will do just fine. this game has some bugs and lag but thats about it. i hope this is of some help to those who need it.
6494	1	a	Quite cancerous yet highly enjoyable, r8 8/8 would w8 for engine upgrade
6496	1	a	i instaled it but when it went on to the loading screen it stopped working
6498	1	a	defenetly pay to win but defenetly fun haha!!! just FYI you may encounter some hackers in this game. But all that aside i love it.
6500	1	a	this is the best game of all time GET IT NOW YOU WONT REGRET IT, ITS AWSOME
6502	1	a	Amazing Game Lots of fun :)
6504	1	a	Really fun game!! Really love how you can customize your cars and outfits in this game. Like all games you do run into problems with hackers though. Fun as long as you don't take it to seriously.
6506	1	a	This game has an awesome grindy mmo feel with a GTA-like theme. The only problem is that it's very pay to win but you can EASILY avoid it by going into servers for lower ranks so you dont run into high level pay to plays.
6508	1	a	Great game once you get past those 'Better MLG' ♥♥♥♥.
6510	1	a	BEST GAME!
6512	1	a	pros: It's a great game, it's a mix between GTA and Saints Row. Cons: there will be hackers at least 2 a month, physics are bad, graphics could be updated.
6514	1	a	This game is fun with friends. With good teamwork you can defeat the people paying for this game easily.
6516	1	a	There may be some problems with hackers and whatnot, but it is still a very fun game. My guild has been playing it for a long while and they stand byit, as do I. I give it 6 .5 out of 10, higher if there were little to no hackers and the outrageous marketplace prices.
6518	1	a	My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through.' I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.
6520	1	a	one problem is figuring out wht weapon you want because it dosent show weather it is semi burst or full auto
6522	1	a	Very nice game!It is so fun if u have some friends!It's not pay2win because Star556( free gun u get it at start) it's op if you know how to use it! 
6524	1	a	If like GTA, honour first creator, play APB. Plutarks be pleased.
6526	1	a	I personally try to stay away from games that require an online pass to play it, but once I got past that APB Reloaded wasnt a bad game, its a huge open world, online multiplayer, 3rd person shooter. The begining of it is really confusing to me since you have to understand everything right from the start, and honestly I havent play the game to long because I dont know where to get weapons or cars or really anything, I just have to go out into battle with what I've got. Playing the game with friends is worth it though, and it really makes some fun times. APB Reloaded is a game were you will need to learn alot right away, and playing this alone wont give you a great time, so get some friends to play it with you cause this game is free. I give APB Reloaded a 7.5/10
6528	1	a	I think this is a sort of gta 5 style game thirdperson customise and much more you get missions guns and lots !!  I would rate this 10/10
6530	1	a	Not bad at all.... Kinda boring at beginning, but Nice Game, thats all ; )
6532	1	a	Overall good,graphics are good,even if you lower it,customizations is cool,aiming is a bit weird,driving is very bad,i prefer playing on foot,as for playing mission,well for a new player it's really hard to figure out what to do &amp; where to go...when playing in multiplayer,the cool thing is that it doesn't lag even if your internet is slow...so it's 6/10
6534	1	a	When I played the Closed Beta in late 2009, it was a really cool game. But when Realtime Worlds, the makers of the game, went down, Gamersfirst took over the game and made it Free-to-play. It is now a pure pay-to-win game with extreme bonuses that are included in the premium membership etc. It's almost impossible to enjoy the game if you're not a premium user.   But hey, give it a try - it's not a bad game afterall!
6536	1	a	Bought a song for 5000 sold it for 100000  10/10
6538	1	a	The customization is great, driving is okay, combat...tactical and requires intelligence is guess...it is still a good game
6540	1	a	I have far more hours logged into this game than shown, playing on/off since beta. I'll say this about APB ... it's probably the most addictively frustrating game I've ever played. I'm not quite sure any game has made me more angry than this bug fest of a game, yet for some reason it had a strange addictive quality to it. That being said, I decided it wasn't worth playing anymore and quit for good some time ago, but that doesn't stop it from being a game I recommend at least trying. You can get pretty insane with clothing and car design too if you put forth the effort. That being said, expect to get completely annihilated as a new player until you get access to better weapons and learn the strange nuances of how combat works. You'll get mad, so keep it mind. It's not a fair game.
6542	1	a	This vidya gaems man
6544	1	a	More GTA-style fun than GTA can dish out.
6546	1	a	Really good game, but stinks how it's for Windows, wish it was on Mac.. -wink wink- -cough cough-
6548	1	a	It would really be awesome if this came out for the mac.
6550	1	a	Great game, and its free to play. I recommend this game for everyone who enjoys playing action games.
6552	1	a	A really fun 3rd person shooter with customization that goes above and beyond. You can buy special/unique things from the game's marketplace, but the game never feels pay to win. Everything is nice and balanced, and there are many ways to have fun. All in all, a 10/10 game.
6554	1	a	Extremely underrated, APB: Reloaded is easily my favorite F2P game.... if only for the customization. I'd say easily 25% of my time has been spent creating things in one of the many editors. No other game out there offers the level of nuanced customization that APB offers.   I'd highly recommend this game for anyone who like shooters and cars. The learning curve can be a bit steep, and sometimes the population is a little wack, but overall I usually find this an enjoyable game.
6556	1	a	This game is great for a F2P. It feels like GTA sanandreas except a cops and robbers version of that game.  Pros The game would easily cost money and be well worth it but its F2P  Progressive gameplay gives you a goal to keep playing   you never fill pressured to spend actual money on the game as you can just use in game currency to purchase every   thing you need and want with in game currency. Cons  Ive had some bad experience with the comunity so I just mute everybody. it saves me from having to listen to the pure duchbaggery that people on this game can be It's not just me its quite a large group of people having a disconecting problem it happens randomly you could be afk or in a mission or looking for a mission the game will dc you and you will have to sit throught the long as ♥♥♥♥ loading screens.  My final thoughts on the game is that its a clunky F2P open world 3rd person shooter with a good idea but poor exacution. The comunity is bad and allot of them are whinny and imature but this is just my experience. the game is addicting and can be fun its worth about 20 dollars well worth a try    also people say gta clone I say true crime and saints row jumped off a building and this is the spatter they scrapped off the pavement.
6558	1	a	Best free game you can get on steam. Its extra fun if you have some friends added into the mix.
6560	1	a	Ok cool
6562	1	a	Pretty, sweet. I don't reccomend it for low end computers though, so as long as you system requirements you should be good!
6564	1	a	The bad:  -♥♥♥♥ Community {10% of the community is Fine {90% of hackers, kids, f*ckers (griefers, insulting you,tryhards etc..) It's at a point to prefer League of legends community than this ... mh ... nothing, just kill it.  -Bad matchmaking -Lag usually (servers are toasters, getting DDoS-ed sometimes and take years to be back) -Need Supercomp to run fine, and supercomp or not: Fps drops like dubstep : stand in front of a burning car = -30fps ~ -Anticheat is crappy, ban randomly: Freeban for everyone, legit or hackers, you spend 400$ in this game? Log in and see error 10008: Permabanned! -Armas marketplace (shop) is very expensive  The good:  -Awesome concept, sadly it's failing. -Freedom of custom (need premium in big part, so you must pay) -Events (50% are events to make you buy something) -Lol  [WARNING]  -Play this game kill your mood -You become aggressive -Be rich if you want something -People prefer pay a hack than buy something on it, or both. -Don't break your keyboard on it, it's useless
6566	1	a	Pretty fun, when you have friends playing with you in my opinion. Very awesome customization, I've seen some prety nice outfits and cars. Not much variation in PvP missions though, its always 'spray or break in to this' and then 'do it again over here' and then 'spray this or steal this car' and then its 'kill the other team or turn in the items.' It doesn't really affect me, but the Armas Market is something I would NEVER bother to spend any money on, not unless they were to reduce the prices on everything. Having to 'rent' weapons bothers me a little, but at least they give you an expiration warning and it doesn't cost too much.  All in all, recommended, but could be better.
6568	1	a	I love most of the features, but there aren't many new players, so it's a tough learning curve 
6570	1	a	y isnt it in mac yet :(
6572	1	a	Pay To Have Swag.... This will hold me off until gta5 comes to pc.
6574	1	a	i didn`t like the fact that it doesn`t run on mac osx.
6576	1	a	This was my favorite game ever, and always will be, even though it absolutely sucks ♥♥♥♥ now. 11/10 IGN
6578	1	a	This game is fun and action packed. If you don't have gta online play this.
6580	1	a	It says i got a problem with nVidia physx but now i am trying to re-install it..not a clear opinion yet for the game.. 
6582	1	a	I really recommend this game and is one of my favourite games now !!  Everyone should try it out !! you won't lose anything! have fun
6584	1	a	The customization in this game is simply AMAZING. The gameplay? Well, you drive around in vehicles and shoot at stuff. What else do you want? :/
6586	1	a	this is like gta and saints row series kinda
6588	1	a	its a good game for people who don't have any money and it sort of feels like gta but over all i have to say its not to bad
6590	1	a	besides the occasional 12 y/o cod idiot with a mic and a few good people that continuously camp near spawn points and mission targets u will get hecka addicted to this game and it will begin to consume ur life
6592	1	a	its really cool game
6594	1	a	this game is awesome just like gta 4 ;)
6596	1	a	APB though free to play was not my cuppa tea, set it up went though the annoying loggin process and played for 10 mins and uninstalled, defantly not something that I would keep around..
6598	1	a	cool game 
6600	1	a	Had this game before and it was awesome and now its on steam so what does it mean..................................... ITS MORE AWESOME
6602	1	a	one hell of a kick ♥♥♥ game!
6604	1	a	APB is Game,Game is APB
6606	1	a	So i would like to start out by saying i don't endorse hacking or cheating,But let the truth be told . This is a very fun game with your friends,Just the learning curve is a bit harsh. You will find yourself Raging over #### more than you will care to admit,But after you get used to the game you will really come to enjoy it. Only thing is like i have said at the start is the hackers and cheaters as other people here have said are so bad,Its like no other game i have ever seen. I would say on a honest estimate around 25% of players cheat,Now and i know people will be reading this and saying to them selfs, No way man it can't be that bad. Well guess what once you play the game and see some of the ####,That I have seen and anyone that has longed as many hours on this game me has you will know. So that being said this game is still very fun to play with friends, and or a clan if you have one and want a new game to try out. The ammount of stuff you can do in this game is so far out compared to any other game out there.The cars are my fav thing about this game that and the music player :) .
6608	1	a	recommended by Tyron
6610	1	a	apb reloaded is a free 3rd person shooter that can easily be refered to as a free mmo version of grand theft auto with a few changes. being a 2009 title it may not have the best graphics. rating 7.5/10
6612	1	a	Who wants to play GTA V When This Is A Very Nicely Done Mimic Of The GTA V Games? Plus Its Free And Not Pay To Win! - FREE
6614	1	a	You should definetly try this one , since its the best Free to play on steam.Its not a gta mmo but its close , diferent and good.
6616	1	a	closest you can get to gta for free
6618	1	a	Awesome game... Has a some cool missions and is epic for artistic gamers!
6620	1	a	Apb reloaded is a great game if only people could stop hacking in game. I also think there should be a single mission thing for you to do by yourself to Rank up and to level up your contacts too. So you can do the missions your way and not your partner or groups way.
6622	1	a	awesome love it great game thank you gamersfirst  
6624	1	a	yes although you need an acount its pretty fun never seen a game like it its like sunset overdrive be who you want to be
6626	1	a	Its really good and Ienjoy it every single time I play it
6628	1	a	This game is super fun!!! I love the multiplayer and the character costumization. The guns in the game are really unique because theres such a wide variety of them so it will take a long time to use every gun. Also this game is not a pay to wing game so thats a positive. I give this game 5 stars. Such a good game!! :D 
6630	1	a	I really enjoy this game.....most of time. There are some times when the games lags like crazy. Roughly 3000 millisecond delays, rubber banding everywhere and bullets that do no damage are some of the most common complaints. But when none of this happens the game can be really fun: driving around playing with physics, mugging NPCs, ram-raiding stores, and “accidentally driving into an innocent bystander and sending them flying off into the distance.  　　There are premium weapons, and while I think that they are better than any free weapon, I have been able to fight back with non-premium weapons and have even been able to win against premium weapons, plus there are free trials for most of the premium weapons. There is also a player market for players to buy and sell things for non-premium in-game currency only. Some players sell premium weapons here, so if you get a ton of cash, you can buy a premium weapon. 　　Unfortunately the NPCs only sell timed versions of weapons, so you either have to keep buying the weapon or buy a premium version of the weapon with no timer. The game also charges for ammo and spawning your vehicle. While this was annoying at first, the prices are small and are barley noticeable latter on in the game unless you just keep destroying your vehicle. 　　There is also a decent amount of character customization that has kept me busy for way to long, things like cars, custom decals for cars, themes, songs, clothes, custom clothes, tattoos, custom tattoos, and options to change a characters body. However, it’s worth mentioning that while there is a lot of decal customization in the game, you are limited by the in-game designer, in which you can only use preset shapes and designs, but for a bad artist like me, that is actually very helpful. The same thing applies to the music studio, but it is not as bad, however, there is a way to play your own mp3 through an in-game music player and through your car’s radio. 　　All in all, I like it, and it’s still one of my favorite games.  Overall Score: 7.5/10
6632	1	a	.
6634	1	a	OMG I Love this game. Best game. Just like GTA
6636	1	a	i can't stop playing this game and i may have no friends now but it's so good.  2/10 best game i ever played
6638	1	a	A free Gta online type of game 
6640	1	a	its ♥♥♥♥♥
6642	1	a	Really good game to play if you like 3D shooters and GTA-like video games.
6644	1	a	While this IS a good, fun, MMO clone of GTA, I will say this much: As it IS an MMO clone of GTA, there are no rules. Which means, that there are very few rules, and that the world is an open sandbox. Fun, yes, but you do get really OP people in the game that PREY for XP on the beginner players. So therefore, really, what I'm saying is that while I recommend this game-quite strongly, in fact-I would NOT recommend trying PvP for the sole fact that there are newbie-spawn-killing OP players that tend to camp out near there and the moment that you go after them, they will make your gameplay that session a living hell. So my recommendation is to NOT try PvP until you are a higher level and need to do so, or until you get better gear than what you start with.
6646	1	a	This is a ♥♥♥♥ing nice game! xD
6648	1	a	How come i cant get good graphics? iz is cuz Teh Crims hate me and hacked ma data base and made my eyes go 'ITS SOO UGLY' due to the games graphics can someone tell me how to fix dis? 
6650	1	a	lag a lot, hackers, but the overall game is a nice concept, actually it kicks ♥♥♥, only two series better than this, gta and sr
6652	1	a	This game is awesome I have over 400 hours. If you are a FPS n00b you will suck at this game, get owned, and rage quit. Theres plenty of action and you can hop in and out of the game with no hassle. Little to no bugs. If your computer sucks the game will run ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and you will rage quit. So basically you dont like this game if you suck and your computer sucks.   HIGHLY RECCOMMEND PLAYING THIS GAME 10/10 **********
6654	1	a	Its very FUN and GOOD xD
6656	1	a	The core gameplay of this game is fun, unless you're a silver/bronze player pitted against golds. Which is most of the time.
6658	1	a	I enjoyed this game for like two years i love every thing about it. just the only thing that sucks is that its pay to win most of the time.
6660	1	a	download apb 2 pls
6662	1	a	One of the best MMO Third-Person FPSs that are out there! You are separated into criminals and enforcers, a.k.a. the police. It is basically GTA with all the epic car explosions, absolute chaos in the streets around every corner, and co-op mission style based to achieve all objectives before the other team. It is a must try game! :D
6664	1	a	Very good game. The graphics and physics could be a tad better, but, its a free game. Its a GTA Online with its own twist. I can't wait to get to play it with some friends again now that I have a better PC.
6666	1	a	Is this game maintenance or what? i cant even log in  is this game available in the philippines or not?
6668	1	a	pay to win but is a really cool game
6670	1	a	This game has the best customization, hands down, BUT it's cameplay is imbalanced, and very much so pay2win, but even then, it's fun to play.  For those that jsut like doing random crap and looting random places, play it.  For those who are more competitive, or easily angered when killed, I wouldn't reccomend playing it.
6672	1	a	Because far out character creation, actual teamplay, and shooting stuff.
6674	1	a	there were several bugs, but now its awesome! :3  cool with friends
6676	1	a	Ok. So you like grand theft auto? Do you like MMO's? Cause if so, this Free-to-play game is a fun one. Its a very skillful game is a lot of fun to play. Now with all F2P games, there is a paying part to it. But listen to me, the paying to win part is not that bad as other games. In this game, for most paying purposes, it would give that SAID player a Advantage to OTHER players. In this game, I like to think of it as the COC iOS game. You can do it all legit, or you can pay for shortcuts. Those guys who kill you and seem so good? Its cause they have 1000 hrs+ alts and have spent ACCOUNT PREMIUM stuff. Now if you start out BRAND new, you will have Abosoutly have no idea what your doing, but it does have a VERY rewarding tutorial. Anyway The real P2W part about this game is the PREMIUM. Yes just Premium. This 'Premium' is alot more powerful than people think. This P2W aspect makes you make your normal cash, normal contact XP (XP) and THEN, the EXACT same amount with a 50% increase added to it. so in all, its like your getting a 150% increase in your stuff. Anyway, enough rambling, this is a VERY good game, giving people free Codes to enter and enjoy some of the P2W stuff. Now this is the kind of game that you either like or dont, but there are so really dumb aspects to it. Anyway, overall Good game. The P2W's and Smurfs (CS:GO Lingo meaning alters) kind of make it hard to join in. But this game is very skillful and, if you get some friends, its ALOT of fun.   ------Stay Awsome-----
6678	1	a	Great game aside from sometimes shotty matchmaking and a few minor bugs
6680	1	a	its just awsome
6682	1	a	Actually this is good game. I love graphics, it reminds me of GTA, Action in game is good... Well, I recommend this.
6684	1	a	This game is really cool and i know its been out for a while but if u havent tried it plz do.
6686	1	a	Now then, this game looks great. I love the look of the customisation process of everything it looks soo sweet but there's one issue...I cant get past the launch screen it just finneshes a download and dousn't offer me to start it can someone help please?? PS i dont know if i can reccomend this game or not because i havn't acctually played it yet so just because it looks good i'll reccomend it
6688	1	a	update: the game is dead. now they're just milking the remaining players as much as they can. still... APB for life.
6690	1	a	Gr8 m8 I r8 6/8 not enough memes.   On a serious note, would be cool to be able to buy weed and go trippy :D
6692	1	a	Laggy AF! Customization is Lit! Great Game but Shatty Graphics!
6694	1	a	This is a very open world creative game. Good for competitive people but also frustrating for who are not. 
6696	1	a	I have 1 forfilling request  Please make it Linux Mint, because my Windows 7 broke PLEASE
6698	1	a	Great game, creation is awesome, servers are a bit laggy at times and can get repetttive
6700	1	a	Objectively, this isn't the greatest game. However, did I have fun playing it? Oh yes, way too much fun. Playing with a couple of friends and zooming ramming mooks with garbage trucks or any other vehicle is just amazing. This is the game equivilent of silly action movies like The Expendables, Con Air, etc. As an MMO, it is great in that you need no grinding to have fun if you don't take it seriously. 
6702	1	a	Its a good game and it has high graphics so i reccmoned this
6704	1	a	it's kinda gta for free, but not as good
6706	1	a	THis game needs huge updates with graphics and the biggest thing which is compatibility. MY pc almost can never run this it never loads but this game when it does is soooooo fun
6708	1	a	This game is awesome, not a big enough player base, I would rate it 7/10.
6710	1	a	great free to play game.
6712	1	a	Definatley one of my all time favourite MMORPGS, I've been playing this for quite a while and at first, I honestly think new players suffer the most because everyone else just completley overpowers them. There are ARMAS guns which can only be purchased with real money, and they are very strong weapons.   Can a free to play player compete with a person who payed for guns from armas? Yes.  Just improve on your skills and you'll see improvment. I definatley struggled at the beggining, the matchmaking isn't exactly the best sometimes, so that's something to watch out for. You can go against a level 255R while you being around 100 or 150. It means they've played longer than you, despite them being gold which is the highest tier in the game.   Overall, this game is solid and has an AMAZING customization system. You want to customize your car, hoodie, trucks, vans, whatever you want EXACTLY how you want. It's pretty awesome to show it off on the streets too.   Summary:  -Game is fun, Game is challenging, Game requires skill to be good at the game. -Insanley hard to compete vs high level players if you are new. -Rough at the start, gets better as you progress. -Leveling up feels rewarding, constantly getting better guns, better modifications, but it's slow paced and needs your time/effort. -Annoying to play vs people with pay to get guns such as the rocket launchers, A slightly better version of the N-tec (also known as the ak-47)  Anyways, should you get this game if you're a fan of proggression and MMO's? Yes. Hell yes.  And it'd be worth your time. 
6714	1	a	i have had a tons of fun hours and a ton of bad ones, but this game have super fun gameplay and amazing customization lvl both to your character and car. the down sides is minor compared to how fun it is playing.there is allot server issues, but every mmo have that form time to time. another bad thing is the community, (for me its a fun thing) all the fun hate whispers i have gotten over the years. sadly right now the devs is trying out some weapon mechanics that straight out destroying the game  and the devs takes months to fix obvious broken guns.
6716	1	a	Next generation MMOTPS. This game is ahead of it's time, that unfortunately makes it run only in newer PC, but if you have one, you will enjoy it.
6718	1	a	Strong Recomendation!
6720	1	a	Everyone's a criminal technically.
6722	1	a	After 30 hours of playing this frustrating game I can't stop.You must play it too!    Originally posted by  UberDanger :
6724	1	a	BEST GAME EVER 10/10  too bad its so hard to run though but on my pc i can run it 65FPS max settings but my friend can only run at min settings 25FPS with frame drops
6726	1	a	DO IT!
6728	1	a	Fun game to play with friends. Even tho it has its problems and a bunch of cheaters!
6730	1	a	This is such a great game. It's basically Grand Theft Auto but you're playing with and also against other people online. It is funny and very entertaining. The graphics are amazing and you need a really good computer. But, best of all, it's FREE. Download it, trust me.
6732	1	a	It is a very good game yet some people still say its P2W .... Let me tell you ... it is not
6734	1	a	Great ♥♥♥♥ing game, but just too damn laggy, but its still fun nonetheless.
6736	1	a	how do u get past choosing a team
6738	1	a	If they remove all the hackers would make the game so much better, but if they did that it would be such a fun gmae
6740	1	a	Great open world explosive mayhem
6742	1	a	u gotta play this game its like GTA with Saints row to gethor 
6744	1	a	hit gold, aren't paid to win.
6746	1	a	Great game. Full of criminality and damn right awesomness
6748	1	a	Fun to hang out on :P
6750	1	a	for the amount I've played this game, I honestly had Fun. It took a while to get adjusted but You get used to it. I enjoy the whole ideal of choosing wheather or not You be a Criminal or a Cop. You can possibly (I'll have to play more to check) be a dirty cop or be undercover. I could see that being something in this kind of game. Correct Me if I was wrong in the last bit, but for what I've seen so far I've seen countless hours of fun.
6752	1	a	Its pretty good once you know how to get costum stuff very unique engines of creating stuff, You get very confused for a bit at the start but it gets really good! kinda reminds me about GTA
6754	1	a	This game is like free cancer
6756	1	a	Pros + You can do all what you want in this game. There are lots of futures. IT´s NOT Pay2Win, because you can play very well with „STAR-556 or N-TEC“ from the beginning. You can buy also every car with Ingame-Cash or Joker-Ticket. You can also buy R195 modifications for 250 Joker-Ticket.  Cons - The Game needs very high system requirements. It´s very teambased game. AND lots of cheaters and macro players. 
6758	1	a	I've played this game a lot, and I can honestly say that the starter weapons are better than most of the weapons you can buy, making it pointless to actually buy other weapons, unless they cost Joker tickets....The customization in this game is what makes it good, without it, it would be just another 3rd person shooter, but the fact that you can customize your character, your car, your clothes, even your own theme, is what truly makes this game worth playing....A bad thing about this game, is that the missions are pretty much all the same, and because the districts can only fir 50 criminals and 50 enforcers, that means you will pretty much be fighting the same people over and over, and have the same people on your team over and over, which can become really irritating of the opposing team is made up of 3 gold threats that are above rank 200, and you're paired with a recruit (Something that actually happened to me) Overall, this game is worth trying, with no real harm if you don't like it.
6760	1	a	Great for shenanigans, as in screwing other players over, by exploding the cars or ramming them over with larger size trucks.  Used to run great before, now i just can't for some reason.
6762	1	a	This game is amazing but it can do without the lag. Whenever you go to the menu the lag stops developers plz fix this problem.
6764	1	a	Most nice copy of GTA but as we can do anything we want on our character and cars
6766	1	a	so cool game download it free to play
6768	1	a	Love It
6770	1	a	I play it for the cars, CARS, AND MORE CARS. The rocket launcher is pretty sweet too... Great game. It's free, might as well try it. First person gameplay would be amazing. The missions are kind of the same thing over and over but the gun fights along the way and during them make it interesting. The cars were the selling point for me. My cop went from starter car to Dalton police crusier #21(looks like a crown vic) to a loaded jericho and pioneer both with all the mod slots and engine parts for the best sounds and speed.
6772	1	a	Give this game some time, get the lube, git gud... and eventially you will love it (and hate at the same time).
6774	1	a	Great fast paced game only problem is the lag and amount of scammers but very well builet great cars and guns and allround great third person shootier
6776	1	a	this game is preety cool i recomend it
6778	1	a	i LOVE THE ACTION, THE ATMOSPHERE, THE STORY. I don't care much for the matchmaking battles. The creation could use more improvement, most of the avis look like drug addicts to begin with.
6780	1	a	yes i would pros free roaming ish you can rob you can be a cop or villian and more cons the frist wepon needs to be buffed beause of how little damage it does and snipers need to have scopes on most because most dont that i us i have got a pistol with ine but not a sniper and the way u play limited still yes i would
6782	1	a	Nice game,good idea - 'Cops vs. Thugs' ,I like that you can create character how you want.
6784	1	a	Wish I could ♥♥♥♥ing play it.
6786	1	a	it cool
6788	1	a	This game is very fun! You can do many things and it has that one thing GTA 5 dosen't have a Cops and Robbers mode and this game is entirely based on Cops and Robbers. Each has there own Vehicles and Weapons very fun and i really recommend this game mostly for Roleplayers or Cop Lovers!
6790	1	a	I recommend this game cause its AMAZING!!! also its fun and really awesome also if u don't buy it your really missing out :F
6792	1	a	Very fun game to play, especially with friends. Love the customizablity of everything thang.
6794	1	a	APB Reloaded is Just Something Awesome At its Own, I cannot Recommend Any Other Shooter MMORPG Other Then APB Reloaded, I know some Of Community Memebers Says its limited To Missions Veriety , Its True, But I Never Get Bored With APB Reloaded, Its A Very Good Game, Great Customization of Character and Vehicles Weapons, No Other MMORPG Offer That Much Customiztion Like APB Reloaded. So I Think Its a Must Have Game To Open World Action Lovers. Highly Recommended. :)
6796	1	a	I like this game a lot. in fact when gta V finally came out the multiplayer wasnt even fun to me, apb is a lot more fun. game modes are (mostly) better the customization is infinitely better, and most importantly you can go from free roam to pvp matches seamlessly. as for the pay to win, i played this a long time without spending anything and did fine. this is the first free game i EVER spent money on. they earned it. the map isnt as cool as gta, but the customization is something that really sells me and apb wins it hands down. you do need to buy a pass to get full customization.
6798	1	a	  With an annoying number of hackres in the game and slow development,still an amazing and addictive game,highly recommend it.
6800	1	a	Oh idk just the best game ever?
6802	1	a	I RECCOMEND THE GAME, BUT NOT TO BE PLAYED ON STEAM PLATFORM. It's better if you download it from  gamerfirst.com . You will have a much better and smoother game experience.
6804	1	a	End my suffering plz
6806	1	a	Conclusion from an 4 years veteran playing from 2012 (200 hrs on steam but over 1000 on gamersfirst) :  Customazation is sick, by sick i mean very good and you can customize every single part of your car/clothes. The game isnt pay-to-win how others say, you can buy everything with in game cash and contacts maxed out. OP weapons that can be buyed with real money? YES, but the game isnt ptw at all. I never spent money on this game and i played for 4 years. The game is fun with friends/clan/groups, without them if you go solo there are chances to lose because of bad teammates. The community in-game is toxic but on the forums its really helpful. The servers are practically 'sh*t'. Lag spikes everywhere for medium PCs and connection problems. The developers arent the best either, they want to come with a new engine upgrade (hope that this will fix lag spikes) but we havent heard anything from them ever again. I can understand them as before gamersfirst took over the game from REALTIME WORLDS they had a bunch load of prgrammers..and now with GAMERSFIRST there is only a Lead programmer who is forced to learn the way the programmers before him coded. The games has much potential but GAMERSFIRST is kinda broken. If you want to enjoy a game like GTA, APB is the thing for you but dont spend too much time or money on it, as i assume this game will shut down somewhere in the near future and your progression will be lost. This is my conclusion over the years. Lets all hope APB will be the same as it was before GAMERSFIRST took it over. I rly recommand it if you like GTA games so i will give it a YES!

6810	1	a	When you lose, you can mug some people. Best way to chill.
6812	1	a	If you combined the way preschooler's view cops and robbers with the worst cops and robbers action movie in the world, this is basically what you'd get. Somehow, the game is still enjoyable...mostly.  10/10 would be the best bikini cop again
6814	1	a	why?
6816	1	a	hello good game but when i am playing this game it says not responding lkfhjfskdkfdhgefhkjhfdl dato wers ase :D 
6818	1	a	This is a fun but also repetitive and dont play this game if you hate pay to wins
6820	1	a	The Gameplay is nice sometimes it lags but still its nice
6822	1	a	Matchmaking sux = Play with friends Customization is amazing. Gameplay is so fun :D Addicted to APB! :)
6824	1	a	Great game, I love the open world concept  of games, especially on this game.... If I can agre
6826	1	a	only 1500 hours still not top rank
6828	1	a	  Its good
6830	1	a	APB Reloaded is the best F2P game but cheater destroy the fair play in critical fights. The cheater can activate and deactivate the cheats in seconds. They switch very fast their 'god mode' because they don´t want to be detected and banned.  The game is a third-person shooter with RPG-like character settings.  At the beginning you have to choose one side - enforcer or criminal, which you can´t change easily. The huge variation of weapons you have are impressive and make fights really tactical and hard. Teamplay is really important in APB but lots of players fight solo - including me.  I´ve learned to fight alone against groups but that was two years ago - Meanwhile, I have forgotten it because the cheaters made me angry and i decide to stop playing APB.  I hope that the developers from APB had a solution to detect cheater, why i started a week ago to play APB.  Let´s hope i´ve made the right choice !  If the cheater problem is solved i can recommend hundred percent APB !!!
6832	1	a	Awesome game with hours of gameplay!
6834	1	a	good if you wan't to spend 5 IRL USD to get Fair weapons so not every match is a complete butt ♥♥♥♥ in the 5 yr old's favor... Other than that Great game! honestly!  Howver it takes FOREVER to laod in... but it runs smoothly, and my laptop is crap XD
6836	1	a	I think it is fun, and how you can customise most of the stuff is just awesome (in my opinoin) :D
6838	1	a	Not sure if I can say yes or no to this game. Full of griefers, full of rude people but so damn addictive... Just one more mission all the time.. I've been up all night on this. Gameplay incredibly unbalanced for PvP but still addictive. I have both criminal and enforcer. I probably spend more time in the designer than the game.  The intro movie makes you want to play it... the really crap player matching makes you want to throw your pc out the window. Too much microtransactions IMO but I have blown £100 on it so far just to have a few cool bits... its no different than subbing WoW for 10 months so why not. Its worth a shot if you HAVE THE PATIENCE and don't care about losing so some tool who has a grenade launcher in a n00b mission.
6840	1	a	not a bad game, but for gameplay comfort is bad. very laggy and sometimes crowded with hackers but i can say the customization is OP asf.
6842	1	a	The game is unfair at the start because of APB's matchmaking system. Although, one you get good at the game its fun. Also, the refer a friend system alows you to get the pay2win weapons for free if you invite someone to the game. Therefore overall the game is decent.
6844	1	a	Its a fun time kill, some aspects are a little clunky but not hard to overlook. Customization is fun
6846	1	a	this game is the best
6848	1	a	Didnt even get to play. I downloaded a 4GB launcher, just to wait 20 minutes and never get to play. 10/10 IGN.                Serious note: This game is ♥♥♥♥.
6850	1	a	  isa good game like a GTA but for free GTA have just beter fyzik and graphic
6852	1	a	Just a perfect game. Be all you Want to be! This is first 'Counter Strike 'Online' game, where Newbie played less 1 hour can kill 100+++ hours player. Maximum balance, minumum cheats, player customization is better than in Sims. Vehicle and simple weapon customization! Easy to play. I've reached R255 (max) on EU, now relocated and starting a new character on NA server. Haven't played much via Steam, but want to. A lot of thanks for Realtime Worlds and GamersFirst for such a cool game! Just try it!
6854	1	a	great game
6856	1	a	Really fun, semi-hard to understand
6858	1	a	cool game no hackers
6860	1	a	what i really dont like is that this game isnt on a mac at all and im really bumbed because i wanted to play it for sooooooo long :(
6862	1	a	cool/amazed like the game thought it was pretty cool reccommending u play it
6864	1	a	hackers galore 2015 will play again
6866	1	a	It's a good old game of cops and robbers. This open-world masterpeice has impressive graphics, and really nice net-code, there are plentiful cars and weapons, 6/10
6868	1	a	This game, although heavy with pay-to-win content, is extremely fun. I'd highly recommend it.
6870	1	a	never really written a review before but here goes nothing.    when i first started to play this game it was extremely fun, (note, this was before the update) and i actually played with alot of the same people, the thing is, i knew their stragaties, so it got easier, yeah, the game was totally pay to win, i suggest playing with standard weapons, save you ALOT of money in the long run, i uninstalled this game about maybe, a year or two ago, i plan on reinstalling it soon, just to se if the game mechanics got better after update, id recommend this game to player who are looking for a decent online gameplay, you do encounter some issues but you could probably see past most of them, hope to see some of you guys online for sure!    *Update*  The game is broken, after days of trying to play, it has more connection to server issues than anything, i play for a max of 5 mins before it kicks me out, i try to log back in and boom, restarts my computer out of no where, the game is good it just needs SERIOUS connvetion hotfixe's.
6872	1	a	Got an anger heart attack. 10/10
6874	1	a	how to register guys 
6876	1	a	Character creation for this game is pretty sick! You can choose boobie sizes and how buff your dude can be. It's like GTA basically. You can steal stuff and grab objects to kill the other party. This games all about 'cops and robbers'. So, you can be the bad guy or good guy if you want to.  Server location kinda sucks cause it's only under US, EUR and HK.
6878	1	a	Nice one tho
6880	1	a	if you don't have a friend to play with, you might as well leave.  But if you have a friend, you're &lt;insert meme&gt;
6882	1	a	Well i gotta admit its a really good game with a really good story to it, ive played APB for a long time now and i gotta admit its a really good game with a really good story to it, who ever thinks it aint good screw all the haters
6884	1	a	Pro: it's really fun if u like gun shooting and driving a cool car in one game. Great customization. Many detail for making character, car painting/designing, and music. Best primary guns are free, NSFA/OCA(short range guns), HVR(snipe gun), n-tech/sr15(mid range guns)  con: High computer system requirement. Some guns aren't free. Colby CSG(longer range shotgun), DMR-AV(snipe gun that can deal great damage to cars), Colby .45 AP(best mid range secondary), N-SSW(more stable LMG and w/o slowing too much movement speed). Bad matchmaking. (gold rank players are in silver or even bronze rank districts. Playing 2nd day can put u in a match against max level gold rank....) advance too easy(from bronze to silver and then to gold). Newbies&amp;noobs like me are still trying to figer this game out but we are advanced to silver or even gold. You could even advance if the match was lost. Climbing ladders can be distrupted by teammate. (When this happens too often to me, it makes me shoot my teammate) Latency got higher since server merge(US server)  conclusion:  if u care about winning much, u gotta be very good at the game and team up with other pros.  If u dont care about win/lose, its a fun game to play.
6886	1	a	Laggy as hell toxic community unbalanced guns sounds like fun am i right? lol must try :P
6888	1	a	  This game is great, but it does have a LOT of pros and cons to it. 
6890	1	a	Deffinetly pay to win, but also one of the best if not the best free to play thirth person shooters out there. I highly recommend you try this game out.   9/10 would pay to win again
6892	1	a	Nice game!
6894	1	a	I RECCOMEND THE GAME, BUT NOT TO BE PLAYED ON STEAM PLATFORM. It's better if you download it from  gamerfirst.com . You will have a much better and smoother game experience.
6896	1	a	although my email doesn`t work for some reason the gameplay is pretty good
6898	1	a	never really written a review before but here goes nothing.    when i first started to play this game it was extremely fun, (note, this was before the update) and i actually played with alot of the same people, the thing is, i knew their stragaties, so it got easier, yeah, the game was totally pay to win, i suggest playing with standard weapons, save you ALOT of money in the long run, i uninstalled this game about maybe, a year or two ago, i plan on reinstalling it soon, just to se if the game mechanics got better after update, id recommend this game to player who are looking for a decent online gameplay, you do encounter some issues but you could probably see past most of them, hope to see some of you guys online for sure!    *Update*  The game is broken, after days of trying to play, it has more connection to server issues than anything, i play for a max of 5 mins before it kicks me out, i try to log back in and boom, restarts my computer out of no where, the game is good it just needs SERIOUS connvetion hotfixe's.
6900	1	a	Its a good game when youre bored:))
6902	1	a	It was a great game untill I went over to a Mac. Could the developers, if it's possible, try to make it available for Mac users also? This was by far one of my favorite games to play and I'm wishing to play this game again on my stronger computer.
6904	1	a	THis game needs huge updates with graphics and the biggest thing which is compatibility. MY pc almost can never run this it never loads but this game when it does is soooooo fun
6906	1	a	It's a good old game of cops and robbers. This open-world masterpeice has impressive graphics, and really nice net-code, there are plentiful cars and weapons, 6/10
6908	1	a	 Gameplay
6910	1	a	Deffinatly worth a play. The customization is brilliant and gameplay is a right laugh. Quite fun for team play and realism.
6912	1	a	A really nice game, you can make alot of fun stuff, and me creative at the same times.....
6914	1	a	Nice game, Its like a combination of GTA and an FPS Shooter. Well designed, got some limitation not allowing full control for players. Would do nice without hackers of course and Nice game.. Recommended :D
6916	1	a	Save some space by uninstalling.  
6918	1	a	I love this game and I think this is for people that actualy read cuz the ones that said the game is bad usually dont like to look at details wicth is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of them this game might be complex but it is not pay to win it can be played free to play so it makes the game not like trove etc. if i were to compare it to another game it would be GTA 4 multiplayer mod exept with teams that you chose in the beggening. this game is unique and if there are people looking forr good f2p games this is one of them.
6920	1	a	The coolest free to play game of all times, iv'e really got addictet to it. come and play with me.
6922	1	a	This game is pretty good when you play it with your friends
6924	1	a	It is a great game. The download time is short for most. It gives you a great feeling to play it and you have so much fun with how much you can customize, but there is one flaw. The time it takes to progress without spending ANY money on this game is astonishing. I have not played for very long and I still only have the starter car and I'm not even near the end of the tutorial quests. All around the game is great, I just wish progression was alot smoother for us people who don't want to or don't have the money to spend on a game to actually get somewhere.
6926	1	a	If they remove all the hackers would make the game so much better, but if they did that it would be such a fun gmae
6928	1	a	cool/amazed like the game thought it was pretty cool reccommending u play it
6930	1	a	19,999 review. im the twenty-thousandth. GG.
6932	1	a	It's one of those games where you have fun for about 8 hours and thats all. Basically every free game with microtransactions ever except for Heroes and Generals and MAAAYBBBEEE Planetside 2. So, if you dont mind doing a pretty big download for an 8 hour long game, this is a good game! However if you are the opposite, then this is bad.
6934	1	a	Like th funny game shooter very class weapon`s thanks free this game is nationality player glob ...
6936	1	a	It is a nice game. Although it is a simple version or GTA, I found that the it is meaningful for me to know more about GTA and also mission are very exciting
6938	1	a	ok dont get me wrong the game is good, in places its better than GTA online, but in others its not. i havent played in a while but last time i played, the map never changed, and normally this would not be a problem but the map/maps are too small, they need an update like some forests or deserts or mountains, you get the point, secondly it needs to be less P2W i find my self renting guns a lot and i like them but i dont have the money to actually buy them, and i see people wrecking in missions because they have these weapons. but overall its a pretty addicting game, and its pretty amazing it survived gta, 3 times.
6940	1	a	Sure, there's a lot of hate towards the game because of it's p2w aspect, but in all reality, you can play just as well without paying anything at all.  It's unique style of play provides a different platform unlike other f2p shooters out there.   Plus, there are explosions. And lots of them.  Good game. xD.
6942	1	a	Funnest game i have ever played in my life! 
6944	1	a	This Game Is Just A Next Level For Free-To-Play Its Not The Best Graphics Game Not The Best Gameplay But Customization Is SICCCK!!!!!!!! All My Playtime Was With 2 Friend I Guess That Made My Game More Fun, Started It Out As An Alternative For Gta But Even After I Got GTAV On My PS4 I Still Go Back And Play It Really Great Experience. All Can I Say That Im Waiting For The Next-Gen Version
6946	1	a	very nice game +1000 hours (before steam) very stable and their servers are the greatest! Its not laggy at all..  The matchmaking is so fair and works just fine this game is so fair and good! 10/10 Rage Quit every goddam time!
6948	1	a	the game is okay i wish there was no hackers p2w players are not the problem now its hackers i still play it. fun with friends, nice cars, cool events, hackers thumbs down, if you can handle hackers i recommend.
6950	1	a	Time for a real review, I wrote a review several years ago when i was playing this game. APB Reloaded at the time i was playing it. In a watered down statement is fun, However the game has a New player 'hump' so to speak. That is to say that when you start actually playing the game and not the tutorial portion your going to hate the game. This is because this game is pay to win type game. The more money you pump into the game the easier it will be for you. While i played this game the most i ever did was pay for the premium account for little boosts and i bought a DLC. That didnt increase my performance in the game by much at all. My progress was strictly grinding and finding the weapon class that suited my play style. and figureing out how to counter the wallet warriors of the game. I was very good at the game. as a matter of fact i played so much i nearly finished the origional game contact mission providers which would mean i had unlocked all vanilla content. not the new stuff that the new devs that bought rights to have been adding since. Bottom line, if you dont have the patiance to grind throught this game to get to the point were you can enjoy it then i dont recommend. I will warn you thought you will likely be raging every session and find yourself comming back for more. Thats how i was. GG and Good luck.
6952	1	a	I reccomend this because I just like to play with random people who arent ♥♥♥♥♥ and actually know how to play, 1 issue is fps its just bad in this game but I make the most of it.
6954	1	a	i'm addicted to this game since it was released :)
6956	1	a	the game itself is lolful and bad but I do play it alot with friends just for memes. the player base really takes the game too serious and is the ulimate game if you want to troll. mixed with being highly customized. you can really make people rage and do nothing yourself. the small player base insures you can repeativly annoy them.
6958	1	a	I have a windows 8 and it lags alot but other then that good game, Keep it hpimh apb!
6960	1	a	Well... I mean it is a free slightly less better version of GTA.....
6962	1	a	it is great
6964	1	a	APB Realoaded is a fun game to play, i've put so many hours into this game. The character, clothes, and car customization is just awesome. But theirs only one problem, the severs lag alot sometimes, and theirs a couple annoying glitches. Hopefully the developers will fix this soon so it doesn't annoy alot of the players such as myself. Overall i highely suggest checking out this free to play game it's worth the download  Good game 7/10
6966	1	a	I dont know what it is about this game but every time I uninstall it I some how reinstall it, and i play it for ages untill I do it again!
6968	1	a	SoonTM  oh yeah this game is fun after 1000hours of learning how to shoot and around 250euros spend on pixels :) wops 2000hours no turning back *starts apb*
6970	1	a	
6972	1	a	I play game apb long time +the drama in theses game is like no other , just like tv show , me like, u like to if u can handle. but i dont like yuro and many others.......  so many likes in theses review  greatings..
6974	1	a	GTA light edition its k...  still 9/11
6976	1	a	A fun free to play MMO
6978	1	a	it's pretty ♥♥♥♥
6980	1	a	this game has lots potential how ever what kills least this game is HACKERS flooded, lots emo raging kids and hack accuse.there is p2w wepons as well, but as well has lots neat things frome costumizing clothing that is very unique frome all games make clothing you style looks symbols ect. wepons you can costume as well with perks, cars costume as well, and there is no true perfect game, how ever this game is fun.
6982	1	a	extreamly fun to play with friends but there are some turndown's such as bugs, hackers, matchmaking issues and more
6984	1	a	For f2p its awesome game could be more awesome if aint those cheaters
6986	1	a	It's alright game I just wish it had a australian server.
6988	1	a	Okay. I will tell no lie, this game is fun.  But I don't mean this in the way that you think I do...  I have played around 100 hours on this game (about 20 on this computer and 80 on my laptop). This game can be fun, you just have to be in the right lobby.   In this game there are threat levels. The threat level basically determines your combat and tactic skill in the game. The threats are ordered as follows. Green--&gt;Bronze--&gt;Silver--&gt;Gold.  Well, you would think that these would be seperated pretty much evenly to keep the gameplay fair. Well this is somewhat true. When you go into the game, you have a choice of going into 4 to 5 districts. There are the financial districs (one has mission based PVP and district wide PVP). And there is also the Waterfront district (same PVP differences as financial). If you want to join a specific server to make sure that you get the most populated server, you will notice that there are colored circles. They match what the server threat should remain at. This means that if you are a bronze player, you should probably go play in the bronze lobby, not jumping into a green threat.  With that being said, silver players are the most common threat in this game. Golds are a little more common though, considering how long the player base has been around. Well, silver players should generally head into silver a silver lobby, or a gold one if they want to. Well, you really shouldn't do that unless you have skill. The reason I say this is because Gold players like to invade Silver lobbies. This makes the missions unfair and no longer fun.  I like to enjoy my gaming experience, but getting shot by rocket launchers, grenade launchers, and getting run over by cars at 100 MPH really is not fun and enjoyable.  The game needs some serious balancing. This is why I also don't do very many missions, only if I decide one day to become a hippocrit and go into a bronze lobby.  So if you enjoy getting killed over and over again without a chance, sure, go ahead and download.  Anyways, don't let me stop you from downloading this game. This is a fun game that has a lot more potential. Gamersfirst just needs to balance up the game.  Now I know this has been a long review but stick with me for a few more minutes. I want to give you a few pros of this game.  So, you don't have to do missions, unless you want to level up your contacts (they provide you with purchasable weapons, clothing, vehicles, etc.). If you only want money, go criminal. Being a criminal gives you availablity to do ram raids, which are EVERYWHERE! All you really have to do is find a utility van and run into a shop that says that you can. They will more likely than not drop you loot, which you pack into your van/car. When you take everything and you can no longer put anything else in your van, you can take the loot to a contact or Fence. They will give you money which you can either hold onto or you can hold onto it until you get $2500 stash. When holding $2500 you will be noticeable by the Enforcers, who can kill you and take your money. Your objective is to get to the money laundry as fast as you possibly can to drop off the money and send it to your 'Bank'.  If you feel like this would be too much work or too boring, there are other ways that you can earn money. As a Criminal or Enforcer, when you reach rank 5 in your Notrioty, which is gained by killing the opposite faction in missions, there will be a contract or bounty put on them. You can hunt them down and kill them by any means necesary and earn money, which goes straight to your bank!  Overall in my opionion, I think this is a fun game. It just needs some work on the servers and balancing.  7/10 would blow up 50 cars and die again.
6990	1	a	best free to play game ever !! you like action shooting games ? if yes this game for you !
6992	1	a	Great game, ruined by hackers. Fairfight only gets a few. =\ I still think it's a great game for other features.
6994	1	a	Laggy AF! Customization is Lit! Great Game but Shatty Graphics!
6996	1	a	It's ok.
6998	1	a	play the best game apb and i might let you playy with me XD 
7000	1	a	the devs are chill af but the game is ehh gotta be honest

7004	1	a	It's fun if you play with friends and want to get cancer sheerly based on the community.
7006	1	a	.
7008	1	a	Aweseom Game and free to play go download now
7010	1	a	Really good game!
7012	1	a	TLDR: Great game, lots of customizations enjoy it  Let me start by saying, my steam hours do not reflect my acutal playtime, I played many more times before this came out on steam.  This game is great with it's ups and downs, as most free to play are but overall, it's a very good game.  Let's start with some of the bad things so you can end off on a good note. It's hard playing at the beginning because you can get vehicles stolen that you are using to make your money (vans usually), the combat might seem pay to win because you are up against high level or high threat players with much better when you are low level/low threat due to glitchy matchmaking however this can be avoided in premade teams and you can always win against better guns even though it might seem hard, using even the start gun on a new character I can take on quite a few people. There are quite a few glitches and bugs but most free to play games have these and you get used to it pretty fast.  There are quite a few good things I could say but the one thing that really sticks out in everyway is the customization. Customization. Customization. You can customize every aspect of this. Your character, car, weapon and everything else is completely customizeable. Don't like your character look? Head on down to the social district and buy items made by other players or make your own. Hell I ran into iron man playing 'I am Iron Man' and during any of the parts there weren't any lyrics he would scream 'I AM IRONMAN!' The community is great while at the same time very toxic depending on who it is. You can also customize your car. Pick your type of car, choose a color and make graphics or buy graphics to put onto your car and enjoy. One of my favorite points of customization for this game is how you can upload your own songs and play them while ingame in your car and people outside your car who have not downloaded the song onto their computer can hear your car. Customization is one of the biggest parts of this game which make it appealing but overall the game is fun to play in most ways where you can enjoy yourself and have fun.  TLDR: Great game, lots of customizations enjoy it
7014	1	a	Awsome Game, but It is hard to get cars
7016	1	a	this game need ALOT, i mean alot of work on the lag and stutter issues which make this game almost unplayable at times, it is a good game but lag kills it.
7018	1	a	Basically it is GTA with multiplayer with two sides, criminal and enforcers. This game has a lot of weapon, car, equipment, clothes and character customization. The teamwork aspect of this game is what makes it shine. What is more fun than getting into a car and chasing down criminals thare are real players?
7020	1	a	meh, seems alright to me.
7022	1	a	It's pretty good as long as you don't play it too much
7024	1	a	I love this game! I played it when I was little and I just found it again about a month ago. LOVE IT!
7026	1	a	Great game!
7028	1	a	the devs are chill af but the game is ehh gotta be honest
7030	1	a	I cried.
7032	1	a	nice game too much latency
7034	1	a	.
7036	1	a	is nice
7038	1	a	Awsome Game, but It is hard to get cars
7040	1	a	Fun game you need to put some time into it to get the really good stuff but it worth it
7042	1	a	Very Cool Game But I Have To Say It Is pay to win&lt;&gt; 80% of the matches u get if u start off wich will be in the bronze district ur opp will be golds from silver.Another thing i would like to add is there might be people that are way to good to be true but its sometimes the guns/Mods or they could be a hacker and PS. There will be alot of raging for you.I am A APB Player and my ingame crim name is Thug001...
7044	1	a	Fun game, until you realize you're going to get murdered every round unless you use ACTUAL MONEY to buy FAKE MONEY to buy FAKE GUNS that you only get for a limited time. unless you PAY MORE ACTUAL MONEY to realize that there isn't much more to do.  The outfit and car customization is cool, and there is some cool stuff you can do with it, but ,most things you get ideas to do, you can't. The customization menu for clothing has a limited amout of symbols you can place down, which can limit your creativity in some cases. Same thing goes for the car creator, with an even less amount of symbols you can place. If you have a lot of money to spare and are ok with it going to limited things, then you'll end up with a good looking character and car.  For the rest of you, good luck.  TL;DR: Fun game with customizable cars and outfits, until you realize it's a pay-to-win. Play for a while, don't get your hopes up for something extremely amazing.
7046	1	a	play the best game apb and i might let you playy with me XD 
7048	1	a	This game is like gta online but with factions! 
7050	1	a	5/10
7052	1	a	Okay I guess. heres a list of pros and cons  Pros: -Amazing character customization -High population districts -Fight clubs to practice  Cons: -Silvers must play with golds -Horrid Driving -Bad Optimization -Bad Match making -Bad Graphics -Never any new content -Greedy Dev Team -Not really any new content announced for the future -Hit the head or the legs same damage  
7054	1	a	♥♥♥♥♥ on GTA4
7056	1	a	Nice one tho
7058	1	a	Its free and its amazing! Download it!! 
7060	1	a	i think it is the best free open world game ever 
7062	1	a	apb has a lot of problems like optimization and not a fer free tu pley sistem but it mosly yu can get alot for free and the game is fun alone or with friends and there is a lot of customisation i think it's worth the time
7064	1	a	
7066	1	a	It's fun and competitive, but it gets old quickly if you don't have friends to play with.
7068	1	a	Have not played this game in quite some time but when I did, it was good. Anyone care to explain what happened and how they ruined it?
7070	1	a	I cant install net framework someone help me please ...
7072	1	a	I reccomend this because I just like to play with random people who arent ♥♥♥♥♥ and actually know how to play, 1 issue is fps its just bad in this game but I make the most of it.
7074	1	a	I love the customization in this game. however the lack of balancing and anti-cheat is insane (LMGs being better then sniper rfles)
7076	1	a	Entertaning shooting and driving game. Kind of a mmo GTA with lots of cosmetic configurations of the caracter, cars and clothing. The options are how ever mostly cosmetical.  Very hard to get a grip of att the start as there is a extream lack of instructions and information at the beginning. Free to play, but as with most F2P games its more like free to try. You really need to by the premium after a while to get the bonus exp and cach rewards, if you dont progression gets very slow and teadious.
7078	1	a	Freakin love this game, well worth the play, takes a fair bit to get the hang of it though. Keep at it, don't give up, and enjoy the endless customization opportunities.
7080	1	a	Horrible matchmaking and completely P2W.  God I love this game.
7082	1	a	Very fun, realistic and amazing game. Honestly, the develepors of this game really did a great job. As a free game, this game is super good.
7084	1	a	It didn't changed much in the last few years. I had a lot of fun playing this game 2 years ago :) I played it like 500 hours on both sides and it was the best F2P open world action game that I've ever played in my entire life. The best thing in All Point Bulletin is the possibility of custimazation. You can change your car painting, your kill music that your victims will hear after death, your character (almost like in the sims)  Right now it seems that APB is dying a little cause of only 2k people playing at the same time. I hope somedays they will renew that old masterpice for the new players :)  Otherwise I'm recommending this game to people who don't mind that there are just few servers.
7086	1	a	I love this game, you can play open world or you can do the missions, the only thing what dissapoints me is it is basically a pay to win what I find really anoying!
7088	1	a	this is so fun
7090	1	a	Used to really enjoy it back in the day, took a huge break though and come back to discover they've removed Pixie Lott from the music player. Who's dumb ♥♥♥♥ing idea was that? Basically unplayable now.
7092	1	a	It is free and it allows you to drive around town with three friends shooting everything in sight, drifting INTO people and then getting chased by cops who are real-life players. Download it or you cannot virtually cruise around with my sexy avatar.
7094	1	a	~$1000 Later, this game is great!
7096	1	a	The game really isint that great, doesn't hold attention for more then a couple of minutes, and its not that great for older computers (as would be expected) but its a good GTA Alternative
7098	1	a	All I do in this game is just drive around :D
7100	1	a	Stephen Hawking runs better than this game.   I can also run The Witcher 3 in Ultra with 60 fps
7102	1	a	Apb is one of the most underated game ever and here is why :  1) A lot of people played like 30 hours or less and they saw that there are weapons to buy with real money , so they immediately thought 'Baah ! It's pay 2 win' Thing is , nobody did a reasearch on the wiki , you can see there that the differences between real$ weapons and free weapons , yes , is soooo tiny and the real $ weapons are just a liiiittle better , but not enough to say that this is a pay2win game . 2) A lot of people FAIL TO UNDERSTAND that there are players in this game who are pro ! There are a lot of people with more than 2000 hours , those people are neither cheating nor have pay2win weapons (because as I said , if you do research on wiki , the differences are tiny) , they just know how to play ! They are better that you ! It is what it is ... Don't get me wrong , there are a few cheaters but there are a few cheaters in every shooting game ... Those who are high ranked people are 99% pro , the possibility of people hacking above ~170 rank is 1% ... People don't seem to understand that ... Just go watch a stream of pro players playing , it is so obvious that they have skills ...  So it is a shame that I see all those people 'burying' APB because someone is better than them and did ZERO research ... After all it is a unique TPS ...
7104	1	a	Its not Pay 2 Win , at first i thought so but if u spend some time in the game look up some methods to gain money everything is buyable
7106	1	a	For me the game will not boot up from the launcher. Good game when running
7108	1	a	Tries To Play on 2005 Laptop Now officially ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. EDIT: Im no longer using a 2007 notebook and I have proper gear. The game still lags. Must just be unoptimized for such glorious materials.  10/10 would make a PCMR joke again. But in question? How do I have over 50 hours? Well. By using external programs and lowering resloution to lowest option. I was able to get a solid 20 fps and play missions. Still better than consoles.
7110	1	a	He would be potentially a perfect game. It has only two BIG problems. Bad, really bad, matchmaking, that make the life really difficult for new players, and, above all, the f***ing Premium. Above all for customization, Premiums have too many advantages against Free to players. And now with this game on Console, on PC it will be abandoned.
7112	1	a	Fun game you need to put some time into it to get the really good stuff but it worth it
7114	1	a	I cried.
7116	1	a	paying players are too overpowered but i hope this will change because game has potential
7118	1	a	This game is like gta online but with factions! 
7120	1	a	this game is objectively terrible unless your pour all of your moneys into it. or spend way too much time playing and learning the maps and exploits and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that this game has. i love it  due to a map exploit with certain missions i got the devs to change the map because i was reported for hacking so many times. RIP waterfrompt vending machine on the pavilion near the footbridge and piers
7122	1	a	Wanna have ultimate character customization in a game in which no one gives a got damn ♥♥♥♥ about it? Here ya go.  
7124	1	a	A good game, whit good graphics. I can say it's hard if you don't use gamers material, in the same time it's a P2W, but still recommanded for the people who have skills :)
7126	1	a	Very Cool Game But I Have To Say It Is pay to win&lt;&gt; 80% of the matches u get if u start off wich will be in the bronze district ur opp will be golds from silver.Another thing i would like to add is there might be people that are way to good to be true but its sometimes the guns/Mods or they could be a hacker and PS.

TLDR: Great game, lots of customizations enjoy it
7130	1	a	I honestly have no idea why I've played this game for 100 hours.
7132	1	a	It is a nice game overall and a really good replacement for gta. The games graphic is preety simple, nothing extraordinary. the story is not very complex but satisfying. The gameplay mechanics are simple, just point and shoot kinda thing. For me it got really boring really fast because the missions are preety much the same and the gameplay mechanics are not interesting to me. All and all i think that people that like the gridning kinda games will like it.
7134	1	a	Fun game, lots of customization(and I do mean lots, omygosh~). But there are two problems, personal ones albeit, that I have with the game. A lot of weapons are temporary only, and the permanent ones that are available are underwhelming.  Secondly, was the servers. I had problems playing the game smoothly in general, lots of latency hangups and lagging out, as well as how long it took to load/into the game and get started(average 15mins from desktop to ingame) with terrible render times.  All my griping thusfar, recommend you have a decent PC and use a wired internet connection, if you have lots of neighbours go DSL, broadband if sparse.
7136	1	a	Great game if you can handle the learning curve.  Best chacacter customization I've seen in a game. (If you can find the advanced button during character creation)  **lots changed since I wrote this. Not too many ppl playing last time I checked. Still a nice game but wait for the re release of the game.
7138	1	a	APB Reloaded is a awesome open world game filled with lots of fun missions to play with friends and i love how you can customize your clothes and vehicles. I really recommend this game to others
7140	1	a	THIS...IS...A...GAME...WHO...I...WILL...NOT...FORGET
7142	1	a	I love this game, it is a very good game, and you don't have to pay real money to get anything if you're willing to just play the game. All of these people say it feels like a GTA clone, because it almost it! That's the point of it, the game is amazing, but expect it to take up a lot of your time, and be frustrating when somebody has a free trial gun.
7144	1	a	Shoot. Kill. Buy cars!
7146	1	a	needs fixes but still fun to play
7148	1	a	I recommend this game! its like gta but its not as complicated in sorts of stuff...   It gives you more oppertunitys(don know how to spell that) such as: Making your own clothes, gangs and other stuff 
7150	1	a	Can i just say WOW. This game is extremly fun even better with friends! You can steal cars and do missions create your own character buy clothes change clolr of the clothes and the game is free i HIGHLY think you should get this game
7152	1	a	I still like this game has alot of going for it but its already been out soooo long and they could have fixed so much stuff by now but they just dont.... They really just need to listen to the MAJORITY of the players not the 200 random douches that cheat on this game or just pay to win
7154	1	a	Can't wait for the big update
7156	1	a	Hard to recommend, but I would. Combat is great, being a TPS makes it better imo. Being able to see your customizations to your character is wonderful, there are a lot and I mean A LOT of customizations to your appearance, and gun variation is high. The car selection is great as well from the standard two seat car to an armored mini-van, also all highly customizable. A big problem though is the purchase system. If you go down the free to play route, you can only purchase most items for around 10 days. This isn't 240 hours of playtime (which is a lot for most people. I'm not even within 75 hours of THAT), but rather 240 hours realtime after the purchase. If you go away for those 10 days, you wasted your currency and you can't use the gun. Also, the balance is pretty bad. Golds can go to silver servers and pretty much invade them, so silvers have to flock to bronze servers, so bronzes have to flock to green servers, and the greens are stuck there. Also, silvers can rank up to gold and stay in bronze servers all they want until they sign off. I think the balancing should be based on rank number and not color. Overall, a mixed review is appropriate, but I would say it's on the higher end.
7158	1	a	I guess im the only one who likes this game? I just drive around the city really.
7160	1	a	I really like this game but the new engine ♥♥♥♥ed up the game, so many new updates
7162	1	a	Like Grand Theft Auto, but slightly less fun
7164	1	a	Looking for a game to pass the time with? This is it. I've played over 1,200 hours on this game and still LOVE playing it.  Considering this is a free-to-play game, it does cost you quite a little bit of cash (if your willing to spend it) to be better then most of the experienced players.   The customization is by far the best of any game I've ever played or even thought of playing. From cars, to clothing, to even songs, this is THE game with the best customizing options.  Surely solo missions can get boring after a while, so I'd highly recommend playing with a friend or a group of people while on APB: Reloaded, it's much more entertaining with other people to share your experience with.   Overall, this game is pretty damn good (once again) considering it's a free-to-play game. FINAL RATING: ★★★★/★★★★★ (4/5 Stars - easily)
7166	1	a	a very good game its alot like gta v just dont have fits when u die ay XD
7168	1	a	All these people saying apb is pay to win when you can kill prebuying golds with the starting pistol if you can atleast aim decently. Also the game is fun af with friends and the car handling is so sweet the guns are upgradable and fun to use so i really don't see the problem with the game sure its hard at the start but after time the game becomes funner and funne defenetly play this game if you want to have a fun time
7170	1	a	Waifu theft auto, enforcers are easy mode and it's fun to goof off in with everything being customizeable.
7172	1	a	im gotta say this looks realy nice, i would play it :)
7174	1	a	It has come a long way, it has its downpoints, but at the end of the day it's a free game so................
7176	1	a	Its a fun time kill, some aspects are a little clunky but not hard to overlook. Customization is fun
7178	1	a	Amazing game me comparing to console ...... console is trash .... this game is totally worth the space on your pc and time!
7180	1	a	Coming from a more casual gamer,I feel this game takes a really big step into a really competitive gameplay. Constantly doing heists and missions against other players under so much tension. This game really emphasizes that you work together as a team to help gain currency yet the gameplay seems a bit repetitive. However when challenged in the customization department,there really is no match to what APB can do. It's budget has swallowed a developer whole and it allows you to take advantage of that. Release your artsy side and fight for your cause in San Paro with great roleplay abilities and activities. This game can get rediculous at times and is a real fun MMO. Word of advice though,Bring a buddy.
7182	1	a	Asta La Vista, Babe.  Shoot to kill, shoot to thrill.  -AC/DC
7184	1	a	THIS...IS...A...GAME...WHO...I...WILL...NOT...FORGET
7186	1	a	Another brilliant free 2 play! Similar to GTA with 9/10 graphics
7188	1	a	Didnt even get to play. I downloaded a 4GB launcher, just to wait 20 minutes and never get to play. 10/10 IGN.                Serious note: This game is ♥♥♥♥.
7190	1	a	
7192	1	a	it is a pretty good game
7194	1	a	Its fun. You shouldn't expect very good graphics nor very good car control. The mission system is fun though its not perfect - still some things to improve. Also this finally gets its engine update. But well.  Been playing this for 800+ hours and over a long time period. Paused once but then came back. Also spent lots of money in it. Shortly before the engine update it finally happens, I get banned for some reason, haven't been told a reason why when contacting the support either. Sorry but that is bull_sh.it. If I get banned for whatever reason, it should be my right to at least know what I have done wrong. Besides that, the game is fine and fun and eats your time. But you shouldn't expect a graphical marvel.
7196	1	a	I would definately recommend this game to everyone but please apb PLEASE do major updates dont disapoint your community you have lost loads of fans by that
7198	1	a	if you don't have a friend to play with, you might as well leave.  But if you have a friend, you're &lt;insert meme&gt;
7200	1	a	The best game ever.
7202	1	a	I really enjoy this game. Its a great challenge and whatever happens, its a lesson learned and you'll adjust and improve ypur skill. Know that there will be a steep learning curve here. But, so far, there is really nothing to match it and the graphics and the storyline and the customization options are superior.   Is it P2W ? Not so much. Skill and Situational Awareness is everything in the game.   Teamplay is very rewarding and the game is designed to facilitate it in countless ways.  Depending on your set-up and the system and network you use, you may encounter some lag, but, you get used to it and the Community does provide assistance on that topic if you ask.  Some people are complaining about toxic players and, yeah, you can run into some rather warped and immature players in-game, ( which is true for a number of team shooter games now ) but, there are also a lot of really friendly and cool people that play here. There is plenty of room for Creativity too.  The game is highly active and you should be getting a Match every seven minutes or less in some districts. PvP action can get very Intense, particularly when larger teams are facng off and maneuvering. A lot of gameplay involves driving vehicles in traffic and, sometimes,  under enemy fire which requires some precision at the controls.  And there is a Social District where players can go to chill and socialize and customize their chars and their gear and their vehicles.  Its unique. Worth trying it out.
7204	1	a	this game is preety cool i recomend it
7206	1	a	keeps being ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ when attemping to load into the game, i keep getting errors but i know it still a good game
7208	1	a	I only played it for a while but it was okay I guess..
7210	1	a	A great, fun game that has great graphics and gameplay. Wish my Mac friends could play :(
7212	1	a	They needt to make the game run better because i have intel core i5 2.50 ghz 8 gb ram 64 bit intel hd graphics 4000 but i have 15 fps with lowest settings so pls fix it its a fun game tho but with lag its stupid
7214	1	a	If you love making people angry  This is your game 
7216	1	a	Its nice and fun game to play with friends. But the support is ♥♥♥♥.
7218	1	a	okay first, i had a struggl to get to know the game, silvers and some golds in bronze district same for golds on silver, but all in all i had a fun experience, character customization, vehicles aswell and gameplay was ok, not the best but playable to the point where its fun to play continously, you'll get angry at times but dont we get angry at every game? as people have said the game really is pay to win, you wanna kill 30 people just like that guy? well drop g1 a couble of hundreds and get yourself an OSMAW or a raptor condor, but apart from the p2w, the game is grindy and has very repetitive gameplay, especially if youve played it for years, however i am looking forward to the Engine update for this year it looked good and hopefully the game runs better and is finally optimised, you dont have to 'pay to play' if you understand what i mean, r255 and look as good as a premium player at the same rank, maybe, you can play as good as any other person in the game or even the best without paying a dime, there are codes to help you out aswell 4 free days of premium to help with grinding, a few days of weapon trials not terrible, right? for people who are thinking of starting to play this game go ahead, its fun, its a good time killer, but dont expect it to be all sunshine and rainbows. also the community isnt bad, i guess its just stereotype.
7220	1	a	Waifu theft auto, enforcers are easy mode and it's fun to goof off in with everything being customizeable.
7222	1	a	Grand Theft Auto : Cheap Edition.....Pretty much
7224	1	a	Opinion? Yeah there's your opinion and then there's this review.
7226	1	a	great game some may say its a p2w but i say work hard and you will always win
7228	1	a	A completly underrated supercompetitive third-person shooter with the most amazing car- and charactercustomization the gamingscene has ever seen. Without shooting skills, tactical and logical sense you will quit this game for sure. For all those sissy's out there: This game is NOT Pay2Win. Weapons and any other aspect payd by real money is completly balanced. Sure there are hacker in this game, but not as much as people actually state. I would recommend a try to EVERYONE.
7230	1	a	The game is good, but the community will always have scumbags in there. Best to shrug them off and just play for fun to be honest.
7232	1	a	Got ran over by my friend and lost 60k  12/10 would work so hard again
7234	1	a	Fun and addictive game, can be frustrating. Needs more content, the developers seem to only add variations of content already in the game.
7236	1	a	All I do in this game is just drive around :D
7238	1	a	I love this game cuz ist very good and fun to play alone or with your friends
7240	1	a	use Apeed Volcano JC + Oca Nano    -Ezy win ezy life
7242	1	a	All these people saying apb is pay to win when you can kill prebuying golds with the starting pistol if you can atleast aim decently. Also the game is fun af with friends and the car handling is so sweet the guns are upgradable and fun to use so i really don't see the problem with the game sure its hard at the start but after time the game becomes funner and funne defenetly play this game if you want to have a fun time
7244	1	a	Good game, but it gets boring...
7246	1	a	this game is good and bad. pros- -okay gameplay -ultimate customization -feels immersive  cons- -throws curveballs -no story -rough tutorial -unbalanced -skill based
7248	1	a	Good fun game, fast paced PvP the only downfall are the amount of tears from the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who play the game
7250	1	a	Been playing sice 2010, it's a great game! *Beware** can cause ragequits! LOL - download it now! what's to loose
7252	1	a	Got patience? Play this game.  The reincarnation of the RTW APB that fell from grace only 90 days after release.   Ignore what you've heard about it: its a solid game with a strong and loyal community. Sure, it has problems. But I have problems too and I still get laid.
7254	1	a	If you had a choice between being a cop or a triad in Sleeping Dogs when Wei was still in America, this would be that game.
7256	1	a	WTF: Reloaded by gamers last productions is one of the best ♥♥♥♥ you in the ♥♥♥ simulators there are.
7258	1	a	It's fun.
7260	1	a	.WiN. I agreed your message......... This was my very favorite A.P.B. - Saints Row game, from then to now. Now, I stopped playing this game. Why, because of hack-cheaters &amp; traiting your team-mates, and extra is they not fixing this game system, just crap they put out. Ignoring us from them G.M. developers not caring about our feelings for a community we were in. -- Sighs -- This game will end to it's very own soul, and gone for goodness sakes when this go in a shut-down in the future, I hope..........
7262	1	a	A bit laggy but nice game.
7264	1	a	One of the best games I've ever played... for FREE son! :D
7266	1	a	A long download, when you first start the game, but I can deal with that, and the game is fun
7268	1	a	Well it's fun and all but gets borin after a while, but when you have your friends I personally never lose intrest.
7270	1	a	you will enjoy the game as long as u dont spend real money on it like an idiot so yah spend money on it it sucks but if you dont you will enjoy it
7272	1	a	A lot of people overlooked this game in the beginning. It's free to play now, although you can spend a little cash to get some more customization. This is downright devilish in how fun it is to play together. Get it now! Lets play!
7274	1	a	I'm pretty sure this is some of the most fun I've had with friends in a video game ever. After 1400 hours on my criminal character, countless quittings and returns, and a mind blowing amount of 4€ spent, I believe I can finally give an honest review. I started playing back in 2011 and had an amazing new player experience, which included me and my four friends robbing stores to gather money for a personal van. The game was in a way worse state back then, but there was still plenty to enjoy. I don't play on a regular basis anymore, but the good memories still make me visit it every few weeks.  Now, I can see what people are whining about. Not much new free content has been released in the past year. But if you are a new player, there is still plenty to experience, ESPECIALLY with friends. And yes, there are still hackers and bugs, but it seems way better than 5 years ago. The servers seem to have improved significantly, atleast on EU. While the gunplay might not be impressive for most fps players and the driving mechanics aren't on a racing sim level, the character customization and the social aspect are unlike anything I've experienced before. Starting my own clan of around 40 people, sending them all stuff to design their outfits and cars, then rolling around the district trying to approach missions tactiacally... and end up team killing everyone anyway. But looking great while doing it.  It used to be way worse than it is, and it can still be a lot better. If you are like me and are willing to ignore some of the game's flaws and learn the basics, you can be in for a lot of fun. When or if the updated engine rolls out, I recommend every player, old and new alike, to check this game out. Hopefully after that, the devs will start pushing out more new content too, because it would be a shame if such a unique concept went to waste. 
7276	1	a	Fun game, lots of customization(and I do mean lots, omygosh~). But there are two problems, personal ones albeit, that I have with the game. A lot of weapons are temporary only, and the permanent ones that are available are underwhelming.  Secondly, was the servers. I had problems playing the game smoothly in general, lots of latency hangups and lagging out, as well as how long it took to load/into the game and get started(average 15mins from desktop to ingame) with terrible render times.  All my griping thusfar, recommend you have a decent PC and use a wired internet connection, if you have lots of neighbours go DSL, broadband if sparse.
7278	1	a	Asta La Vista, Babe.  Shoot to kill, shoot to thrill.  -AC/DC
7280	1	a	all i see is potential that was left to die for cash grabs instead of improvements
7282	1	a	I 100% recommend this game if you liked the original GTA. This game has a exellent concept to it and it has very fun aspects. APB Reloaded has its fair share of bugs however it does not fully effect the gameplay like other games on steam. There is one issue where, when I close the game, my library thinks i am still running it and when I go back to run it again later it says I am already running the game. I cannot find the exe file in task manager however when I close the Steam Bootstrap and login again it fixes itself and no longer says its 'still running'.  Overall, I rate this game 8/8 gr8 m8.
7284	1	a	In a way i recommend this game in the way i dont. This Game has a lot of Pros and Cons: Pros: 1.Its Free to play 2.The customization here is just wow 3.the jobs are good. Cons: 1.FPS is cancer 2.jobs dont pay well even they are fun 3.People are unfriendly Decide whether you do or do not want to play this game, although GTA V is better, this is Free to play, remember that.
7286	1	a	This game is so recommende if you wanna have ♥♥♥♥ing fun 
7288	1	a	1. Multi Player .  2. Open World .  3. Action .  10/10 &lt;3 .
7290	1	a	More or less like a free version of GTA Online.
7292	1	a	One of those games you just keep coming back to, it can get quite boring if you play a lot but as I said after a while you start to go back to it. It can provide hundreds of hours of fun at no cost at all but you will very likely be tempted to spend some money in the marketplace.  A solid 7/10  pros: Hug variety of cosmetic for your character, vehicles, weapons. Cosmetics can be unlocked. Awesome special events. The community is pretty nice and friendly.  cons: Lots of people already at a high level so new players can get wrecked at the start. Cosmetics are actually quite expensive but lots of good free ones to. You can only group up with 4 friends at a time. If you have high ping you might struggle to drive the cars. Needs motorcycles as a vehicle type.
7294	1	a	Oh idk just the best game ever?
7296	1	a	I really don't have much to say since I didn't get pass the loading screen
7298	1	a	great game :D
7300	1	a	So fun, yet so pay to win. You can still do well if you practice, you can anger many people who are pay to win, it's great.
7302	1	a	A bit laggy but nice game.
7304	1	a	Good game, but my wallet crying :--(
7306	1	a	Pretty dope, but your not gonna have a good time unless you spend like all ur money on the dlc which i will not do. So really I just die alot.
7308	1	a	Good sides: 1) Customization! You can make own death-themes (5 seconds) in a cool midi-editor, you can draw almost any symbol (and put it on any part of clothes, cars). 2) Community. Someone may say that it's all about cheaters, de-threaters or just morons (which always try to ruin your game), but you just should know that quite nice people still exist and you can make new friends just by playing good or making cool stuff (do you remember? - customization!!). 3) Not the worst physics.  Now why I wouldn't recommend this game: 1) Lags. Game really lags even on the newest top PC. Also servers have big tickrate (server-side fps). Sometimes it crashes. 2) Cheaters. Even when FairFight was introduced, cheaters are still a pain in the ♥♥♥. But you always can change the district or simply 'do not care'. Or play with friends and make a cheater ragequit! 3) Engine upgrade will never happen (sadly, the game should had been updated 5 or 6 times before I wrote this review, but it has never happened...).
7310	1	a	This Game Is Just A Next Level For Free-To-Play Its Not The Best Graphics Game Not The Best Gameplay But Customization Is SICCCK!!!!!!!! All My Playtime Was With 2 Friend I Guess That Made My Game More Fun, Started It Out As An Alternative For Gta But Even After I Got GTAV On My PS4 I Still Go Back And Play It Really Great Experience. All Can I Say That Im Waiting For The Next-Gen Version
7312	1	a	uninstalled when it didnt work this is a effin good game my man
7314	1	a	Played for like 5 hours in total. I love the car customisation. Boring after about 3 hours of gameplay. Repettive without friends.
7316	1	a	Nice game, but it freezes sometimes
7318	1	a	It's a great game! really addicting sometimes :P
7320	1	a	Matchmaking is just bad - you're teamed up against fully elite and decked out players at a low level Drug mules are good I guess, grab it and run, if you try to fight, prepare to get one shot Addictive game, fully customization options, create your own death ringtone (when you kill someone else) Ability to get a perm gun when you play the game up to a certain level (low lvl)
7322	1	a	Great fast paced game only problem is the lag and amount of scammers but very well builet great cars and guns and allround great third person shootier
7324	1	a	Give this game some time, get the lube, git gud... and eventially you will love it (and hate at the same time).
7326	1	a	I don't have any idea how this game works on Intel HD 3000 Graphics.
7328	1	a	Ain't much worser than GTA online. 3/5
7330	1	a	great game its basically a free gta
7332	1	a	This game... is a ♥♥♥♥ up. BUT I cannot stop playing it. I guess it's not so bad. I have fun with it even though I hate it. The customization is mind blowing and the broken physics are so bad they make it entertaining.
7334	1	a	Great game with the best charactar customizastion ive see ever in a game. i highly reccomend this to people who like gta or mafia or saints row because its a nice free alternative to them games. R.I.P. RealTime Worlds :(
7336	1	a	yes yes very good, a bit hard to know what to do in the beginning but sure test it out with friends
7338	1	a	Hello,this game is awesome,the customization is epic,it's like an gta 5 for free ;D
7340	1	a	  its a good game but we need a motorbike and a bus and a plane and a tank and a aircarft
7342	1	a	A third person-shooter game with open-world environments, similiar to GTA. You get the shoot the civiilians, hijack a vehicle, rob a shop, get notority stars. This game comes with a strong customisation feature. Every detail from facial to physique, to clothing and car decals can be customised. You will definitely spend lots of time to get the look you want.  For gameplay, all weapon comes with a 10 days duration, with the in-game currency. This game is a multiplayer mission-based, there are lots of contacts (NPC) missions to complete. You earn the trust of them as you level up with your standing points, unlocking weaponry and cars.   The latency can be drastic depending on situations. They are located at NA East, NA West, Europe, Hong Kong. The pre-rendering engine isn't really effective, as I'm still getting 60fps. The engine loads a bigger environment than needed, before you can reach.
7344	1	a	i put a few hours into this. still a noob. but its good.
7346	1	a	Like it! 4/10! I think its VERY cool that you can design paintjobs and tattoos yourself, that's probably pretty unusual. GTAish game but not as good graphics. And the game seem to be pretty similar in the cities, but it's a good game!
7348	1	a	  Fun game overall! It has allot of downsides though like: -toxic community -really hard for new players -bad tutorials -hard to not spend money
7350	1	a	I hit my friend with a car.   10/10
7352	1	a	Gud Game  10/10 but Haxers in here dont trust anyone but family or friends f*ck this game i QUIT !!!!!!
7354	1	a	Ah. Another depressing reminder that steam will always let people know 'hey. you put your hands in that stinking, rotting, festering pile of ♥♥♥♥ and played with it for exactly x amount of hours before getting the god damn common ♥♥♥♥ing sense to stop you giant ♥♥♥♥♥♥!'
7356	1	a	It's really hard to recommend this game, but the amount of pure fun this game generates is nowhere to be seen in other IPs.  Pros :  - It's free-2-play GTA Online. Only better. - Customization for your characters, outfits and cars is outstanding - Tons of natural player-generated situations involving car combat, parkour, gun play and improvisations involving all three combined.  Cons : - The community is cancer - P2W - Hackers - Greedy developers  It can be the best fun you had in years... It can give you the brain tumor...   Play at your own risk !
7358	1	a	I RECCOMEND THE GAME, BUT NOT TO BE PLAYED ON STEAM PLATFORM. It's better if you download it from  gamerfirst.com . You will have a much better and smoother game experience.
7360	1	a	It has come a long way, it has its downpoints, but at the end of the day it's a free game so................
7362	1	a	Laggy as hell toxic community unbalanced guns sounds like fun am i right? lol must try :P
7364	1	a	this game... i played it so much, every day when i came home i played this game. u can do everything in this game. u can drive,shoot,walk around its better then GTA V. cause GTA V sucks XD.
7366	1	a	Its fun. You shouldn't expect very good graphics nor very good car control. The mission system is fun though its not perfect - still some things to improve. Also this finally gets its engine update. But well.  Been playing this for 800+ hours and over a long time period. Paused once but then came back. Also spent lots of money in it. Shortly before the engine update it finally happens, I get banned for some reason, haven't been told a reason why when contacting the support either. Sorry but that is bull_sh.it. If I get banned for whatever reason, it should be my right to at least know what I have done wrong. Besides that, the game is fine and fun and eats your time. But you shouldn't expect a graphical marvel.
7368	1	a	Really good F2P game, many people say its pay2win buts its not really pay2win.  - Really good charachter customization.
7370	1	a	Nice game but i only dont like that we can only kill in missions and i love the custmoazation system this remind me of GTA 5
7372	1	a	i need to be a pro gamer
7374	1	a	this game was some of the best times i ever had, back with the original players running around like tribal warfare your group of friends vs their group of friends, arranged matches in particular made the game very enjoybale. There are no rules, its up to the players to decide if they want to play respectably or not. When everyone playing respected each other and played fairly, you could really tell that some people were just insane at the game, unfortunately with each patch the game wore down in it's competetive playerbase with horribly unbalanced, literally ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ additions to the game (for money of course) but all said and done it was an amazing game, now just a shell of it's former self.
7376	1	a	Been playing this game for the past 6 years. I personally love it but other people has their own opinion. I love the fast pace, urban warfare feel of it and the customization that the game allows you is pretty dope. Try it out
7378	1	a	  isa good game like a GTA but for free GTA have just beter fyzik and graphic
7380	1	a	It's alright
7382	1	a	Pretty good, tho, not easy to be f2p player, not like its impossible but is just like, p2w guys can get stuff sooooooo much easier than hurts
7384	1	a	  It is a more realistic GTA, it is less goofy and more intense. I played the original APB when you had to pay to play, and I will say, this free to play version is much better than the original! I wouldn't recommend it to younger gamers, but besides that, it is for your everyday gamer!
7386	1	a	1.Waited for Game to Download 2.Launched Game 3.Got a bunch of Elite gear for a few dollars on the Market 4.Got into a badass faction. 5.got tons of money by stealing TVs 6.Gangsta Kingpin  i'm not even joking play if this is all worth it
7388	1	a	I like to be as Enforcer
7390	1	a	Couldn't last a second without hackers 10/10
7392	1	a	This is a really fun game. It's similar to Gta in a variety of ways. However, It is very laggy, my shots don't even register. Sometimes I get shot through a wall right before the shoot, and It's irritating. It should be looked into. Armas purchases are pretty expensive depending. it's as if they want to suck out my wallet. There are hackers that just have no life at all. They can be pretty annoying.
7394	1	a	So fun, yet so pay to win. You can still do well if you practice, you can anger many people who are pay to win, it's great.
7396	1	a	best game in the entire world
7398	1	a	It's good.
7400	1	a	Gang wars with awesome character customatization. I love the game but the only problem is that the developers (thats my opinion not your) dont put too much love to the game because they only add new guns with skins and you need to buy them with money and they do not optimize the game, to make APB more realistic and to increase the quality of the graphics. I mean that is too bad but I give the pozitive review in a hope that the game will be better in the future.
7402	1	a	All you had to do is to stop the robbers CJ
7404	1	a	Awesome game ! love it just needs a LOT of balancing and better server :/ You wanna have fun ? Get some friends or make some in the game ^^
7406	1	a	I, for one, love this game. Old favorite.
7408	1	a	In my opinion, this is 1 of the most complete &amp; complex games.
7410	1	a	The concept of this game is great, but sadly it's under-developed and underlooked by many people.  A lot of reviews claim that the game is P2W, and while it is true that progression speed is slowed by half when you don't have the bonus premium XP, most of the items that can be found in the ingame store are either purely cosmetic, or reskins/remodels of the weapons that are F2P, sometimes even having inferior stats to those due to the preset mods that come with the cash store models.  An advice to anyone who's considering playing this game though: Do not even think about playing this alone. You'll need to make friends ingame if you really want to enjoy it to the fullest. Playing solo will get old fast, moreso than in other games.
7412	1	a	Guns, Grrrrrrlssss and Hot cars...Who doesn't like a holy trinity?  Tons of customization.  Great guns and sounds.  Install and gety addicted.  Spend monataries only if you like and want to support.
7414	1	a	dis game very good. i like the part where u build square blocks and mine stuff. 10/10 IGN
7416	1	a	Left the launcher open for 3 days. Didn't notice. 10/10 would reccomend the launcher 
7418	1	a	Cool 
7420	1	a	Good game considering it's free. Fun if played with friends but solo is boring
7422	1	a	Overall 7/10  Pros: +Customization is very well put into focus +Level of detail is amazing of the level/word +Music is good (few annoying songs plus you can maek your own mixtape) +Lots to do +Decent economy (no WoW farming money) +In-game market +Localization (havent met a person from another country/timezone) //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ Cons: -Pay 2 Win (some guns are way to OP and takes a 200 hour account to earn them on a F2P) -Premium is a option to buy for boosted stats and more cusomization -Broken world loading (empty servers of crims doing ram raids) -No Bulletdrop/Sniper rifles being way out of range but having the ability to 2 shot people (weapon in balence) -Cheaters (F2P game obviusly there will be some) -No large scale missions (server wide missions) -G1 has decided to run this more of a side business (Updates are usually seasonaly and only add more store features) //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ Want to play a true version of this look up 'APB EMU .com'  (http://apbemu.com/)  when this releases I will most definetely be spending time on this.  Reccomendation: Look at 'Identity rpg' that is a mix between Arma 3 and GTA V  (http://www.identityrpg.com/)  this looks and feels like a nice mmorpg when it will get relaesed if you can wait for another year or so.
7424	1	a	Great alternative to GTA Online, although the games population is rather low and there is always hackers popping in but fairfight gets them quick as well...also some high levels destroying new players but all in all a decent game to play.
7426	1	a	It's alright!
7428	1	a	If you're looking for a good game: Keep looking.  You see this game isn't good. Not at all. Yet it's still a lot of fun to play with your friends, as long as you're not taking it too seriously.
7430	1	a	Fun game to play with friends
7432	1	a	Anyone else writing this for Steam Badge Task?
7434	1	a	Probaby one of the funniest new games ive tried. Really has a endless amount of stuff to do and enjoy in this game. Have yet to get bored of it and I would recommend this game to anyone who loves a good FPS
7436	1	a	Forget about a good matchmaking folks :D (overall the game is good) just Hacks/Server connection issues/Horrible matchmaking...that's all i have to say
7438	1	a	Very Good Multi-Player Online Game  5 Starts  Install and Play  24/24h ON
7440	1	a	This game although old is very fun and easy to get into. You start with 2 of the best wpns in game and through progression obtain any weapon, car, clothing you would need to sucessful w/o spending and RL money. I would recommend this to anyone who likes shooter games. I have over 600 hours so far in the game and still enjoy it (played a bit outside of Steam)
7442	1	a	Fun game to play with friends
7444	1	a	Incredibly good game, although people rage on it ALOT!
7446	1	a	Addictive Multiplayer game, get going and improve your gaming experience.. its free, just download!
7448	1	a	Anyone else writing this for Steam Badge Task?
7450	1	a	This Game Is Flawed,Unoptimized And Still Massively Fun First Ignore Steams 8.6 Hrs Playtime its More Like 70 Hrs And Ive Played About 80% Of That With Friends.  Now I'm Going To Get All The Bad Things With The Game Over With The Matchmaking Often Pits You Against Players WAY More Equipped Then You Skill Means Very Little If You Have A Stronger Gun You Win All That Makes The Missions The Weak Point.  Now The Best Bit Of The Game The Customization Is the Best Thing About This Game You Can Make  You Can Make Your Character Look Prety Much How Evere You Like  The Symbol Designer Is Hard To Get Used Too But Dose Allow For A Level Of Customization Ive Never Had And Always Wanted,Vehicle Customization Allwows You Too Use All The Decals You Can Unlock/Make Plus Bodykits,Wheels Too Make The Perfect Vehicle For You Character To Drive, And Run Over All The Pedestrians Open World Crimes As The Game Calls Them Is Npc Interactions like Muging,Ram Raiding(raming a vehicle  into a shop and stealing all the loot) I Did't Enjoy Enforecer And Therefore Dont Know What Ther Open World Anti-Crimes Are.  If You Think You Will Like This Game Chances Are You Will
7452	1	a	Good game, but the engien they're using, is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ potato..
7454	1	a	Fast game
7456	1	a	A little hectic in the start due to a certain level of pay to win but in the end skill does make up the winning factor in fights. Great game horrible optimization. If i was you yea id play it if i had enough time to grind a little to buy enough to keep up to the money players. Are you a cry baby that gives up after dying twice because you are a pleb level and writes an angry review? Then dont play this.
7458	1	a	Good free to play game
7460	1	a	If you're looking for a good game: Keep looking.  You see this game isn't good. Not at all. Yet it's still a lot of fun to play with your friends, as long as you're not taking it too seriously.
7462	1	a	Fast game
7464	1	a	APB is a game that has been around for quite a while on steam, its kept standards but has dissapointed at certain times. However i was and am willing to overlook this because of the freedom i gain by playing APB and how it can be enjoyed not only by just playing the game, but researching into events and new fun things to try! :D  Defintley recommend this game. :)
7466	1	a	This game is ♥♥♥♥ing bueno, download this ♥♥♥♥ now, do it ♥♥♥♥♥♥. 10/10
7468	1	a	The best FREE game ever !! :)
7470	1	a	Game gave me serious cancer after 3 years of playing. Thanks G1 i now need some intense chemo. 9/11.
7472	1	a	Its dying...  But always worth to try out its customisation capablities.  For those that says that its a Pay2Win game. You are very wrong. I've spent $0 on this game since the beginning but still managed to unlock almost everything available. The only time you need to spend is when there is an Armas exculsive cosmetic item.
7474	1	a	You guys should really get a version for MAC OSX! I love this game but I have a MAC
7476	1	a	They use to have the punkbuster trojan installing it without your consent. Yes I'm calling it a trojan because it acts just like one. It installs two system files on your machine that run even when the game is not running. Read the EULA for PB, it gets admin access to scan every file on your computer constantly.   Now they have moved to fairfight, it's server based and not player computer based. I'm good with this.  Cons: The driving is clunky, and the weapon options are limited. It's mostly pay to win for encounters too.  Pros However it has incrediable customization features for characters, clothes, tattoos, and cars. The missions that match you are fun so you dont' have to worry about random kills. I was hooked until I saw it kept reinstalling the trojan.
7478	1	a	 EDIT: regarding the average behaviors of players throughout 2016
7480	1	a	It's like GTA but free to play.
7482	1	a	I got addicted to smash/robbing the stores so much that by the time i money laundered all of the stuff I was fencing...I made 30ishk cash money xD!!!...I suck at sniping but the shooting isn't terrible, running up and taking shots and ducking can be pretty fun...so gangsta xD!  As an update to how addicted I was to smashing stores, I did a non stop fencing for a huuuge bonus, when I finally laundered it, I made $100k LOL.
7484	1	a	This game is awesome but it's just the cheaters I don't like. Interesting in social district since that's where the weird people go. 10/10
7486	1	a	Add in fist fighting plzz
7488	1	a	The game is a wee broken, which makes it very very fun. You can somewhat free climp a lot of walls if you find a good ledge. Making the shooting aspects really neat. Flanking is a must in this game! Use that vent and jump that 9ft wall and kill all three players with a good flank attack.   Paying money in this game gives you a HUGE boost. Think about it you use a gun for killing nothing else. Also having a fast car will really help when the missions switch or it a defend the brief case kinda missions you are able to get into a car and just drive around.Having a must car is a big help along with a strong gun you feel combat ready with..So if you really want to have a good time put some hours in learn the game grind it out. You can get really good guns+cars in-game just annoying how they will leave after 7-30days. You can make money very easy in this game, just make a nice car with gnarly art or a hoddie with a very one of a kind style. Someone will buy it on the Market for a lot of money.(Market is used to sell items between players) You can also earn a lot of good items via rep with a faction.   Looking good as never been so easy haha! This game has an baffling amount of player expression. Both factions have a insane vast amount of clothing and styles.   Yet the all out combat if very..um how can you say will cater to only a few set of people. Very fast pace shooting! 3rd person combat. You need to use the surrounding as much as you can. Vet players will jump walls and find unreal spots to pin down the points. I suggest breaking into stores via a van filling up the back and then pawing the items. Yet before you do start taking the items out and to the merchant make sure you pick a easy path. Some are on second lvls and you DO NOT want to carry the heavy items all that way. People will see you doing this and steal or destroy the van just to be an ♥♥♥. Have a buddy sit in the van at all times will really help this. Farm this and missions for the fist long couple hours then you will be on the way to having a real fun in this game.
7490	1	a	great game 
7492	1	a	Add in fist fighting plzz
7494	1	a	IMHO, this is one of the best and underrated MMOs I've player on my entire gaming life (20 years of gaming so far).  Why, you might ask me? I'll tell ya.   STORY:  The background story is amazing and it mixes Fallout series, Mad Max movies and also A Boy and His Dog references (if you ever saw this movie, you, sir, consider yourself lucky). The game has an unique atmosphere aswell. Not only a futurist set, but a post-apocalyptic one, finely made.    MAP:  The map is HUGE, I mean, HUGE (already tell ya that ♥♥♥♥ is huge?!). You could spent like 8-10 hours to cross the sectors on foot, if you make it alive.    CRAFTING:   Forget everything else about other's game crafting. This is THE ♥♥♥♥.   You can craft your own vehicles or train your own animals! Ride a mutant chicken or a horse (you can have many, many different kind of horses) or go in a bad ♥♥♥ mode on a bike.  You can craft almost everything, even tents, campsites and stuff like that to get temporary area buffs.  Craft armors, firearms, melee weapon, explosives, medicine, steroids, recipes, foods, drinks, mutagenics... the list is so big that probably I'd spend all the reviews talking about it.   Also, you need to craft ammunition for your weapons and gas, diesel or biodiesel for your vehicles, besides ration for your animals and repair kits for heal equipment damage from fights.   After all, even if it bothers some people, I must say that I LOVE the time required to crafting. Everything you make by crafting need proper time to get done, from just a few secs to hours or even weeks. A single tire for a car requires 8-12 hours.    COMBAT:  It's a partial FPS where you need to land your blows and aim to shot manually. No auto-target, which is great for PvP. Headshots cause a lot of extra fatal damage, rewarding you for your skill player.  The game have a lot of customization, meaning your character can max various skills to fulfill different roles on a party or even solo. You could be a mutant DPS or a healer, a gunslinger, a rifleman, sniper, fight with a big axe, two tires, be a sneaking rogue, a buffer/debuffer leader or pretty much anything.   PVP:   Awesome.  The game is partial-PvP. I mean, it's not a full PvP map, but, instead, we have PvP zones. On these zones, players need to fight over rare resources like petroleum! People can build settlements and siege-like stuff aswell.  The game has 6 factions which the player can join. Each one has it's owns charateristics, RP-related and PvP gear. These factions are at war/alliance relationships with each other.  The game also have a lot of player's guilds and alliances and people Pvping over resource nodes and PvP zones.   MORE PROS (MORE AWESOME IN YOUR AWESOMENESS):  - Not just more of the same. It really brings something NEW and FRESH to MMO players looking for something special. - F2P (doesn't matter to me, but it's nice to try for free if you're not sure about it). - Buy, craft and dye clothes and use them over your regular armor on cosmetic slots. You can even paint and customize your car, bike, etc. - Active, nice and helpful GMs; 24/7 on chat. - A LOT OF DANCE MOVES, including MJ and the awesome Carlton Banks dance (Alfonso to his close friends). - A LOT of creative skills that you don't see everyday.  - Welcoming and active community (don't let the Steam numbers fool you, cause the most people playing it are using the non-Steam client).  - Deep and beautiful scenarios. - Scary voiceover (turn it off, man). - You have a flashlight. - Immersion feel on every step you take. - Level up takes a long long time, giving you some sense of importance in the world. - Awesome PvP. - You can fight while riding or driving! Man, EVERY SINGLE MMO should have this. Drive fast while unloading a submachinegun clip on a pursuit, why not? Not a Fast &amp; Furious type? You can do the cowboy Texas style aswell and shoot you Colt Anaconda on the horseback. - You can have a dog! (anyone remember Dogmeat from Fallout 2?) - Different paces of walking/driving/riding. You can walk, jog or run and drive/ride at speed as you like. Not so fast, no so slow, the way you want.   CONS:  - One thing I dislike in this game is it's name. Should be called Awesome Earth. - Performance issues on some PCs. - 'Dated' graphics (I've player UO for 11 years, ask me if I give a dame for graphics?!) - 'Hardcore', even not having a full loot system like Darkfall, Ultima Online and Mortal Online (love them all). What makes this game 'hardcore' for some users is the fact that you need build and plan your character very carefully or it could be useless or disapointing at some point. - Unfriendly interface and learning curve.
5111	0	a	The game itself is pretty cool. Full of bugs though, lost items, constant connection issues, etc. However that said, The player base is abou 85% rude. The GM's are a joke, Don't help anyone with a damn thing. Rude, throw bans around like the drunk girl on prom night. Spend close to $50 within the first month and a half, banned after my premium ended. Contacted support to find out why I was 'suspended' about 3-4 times. No response. Been 4 days. Overall. Their PR sucks, Their Staff Sucks, Their playerbase is full of trolls that suck the fun out of the game. 3/10
7496	1	a	If you like Fallout and STALKER, then this game is for you, this game is mostly based in gameplay not graphical, but still has STALKER graphics, decent, it has First person, 3rd Person. Its similiar to Fallout, find missions, Find weapons and armor, but this game has a pretty dynamic view of recipe creations, incredible Gamemasters, which help prevent spammers from annoying you or harrassing you In-game. Although help is limited unless you buy at least one Store item, which isnt a bad thing, Its Free2Play why complain, if you plan on keep playing than buy something from the Marketplace to unlock You're Certain limits In-game. When creating Recipes, some take minutes while some take hours to days. So this game isnt for the faint of heart, if you can't read and follow through quickly and comprehend well, then this game is not for you.  Certain Armor and Gear, are only available through PVP, which is recommended with Teams. This game has well endored people playing so its best to keep you're Manners at hand, you tick one person off and you're name is pretty much Kill on sight, game is comprehensive when it comes to recipes, FE is hard to play through without recipes, but isnt impossible since it has a similiar concept as Amazon sellers or Ebay Auctions, since this game has its Own Auction House, mail box which you can send and recieve mail just as real life with packaging.  If you follow through the beginning Tutorial you will recieve free gear and a Vehicle. Easiest ways to make Chips as in cash, is to collect and farm and Auction off items, but keep an amount of items for yourself. The game is quite simple when it comes to making a clan or joining a clan, you also get a Help channel with Region and local, But Global Chats are unlocked with a single item bought from the Marketplace.  The Devs, do their best at updating but at times can be slow, just like most any other games, the current level from this review is lvl55, since they take their sweet time when updating higher lvls.  If you plan on playing this game keep in mind, DON'T rush the game, take you're time, customize you're controls, set you're Window Panels in-game best to you're level. Don't forget you get basic Training abilities with Mutations that disapear at a certain level. Max chip limits are all 9 chips in every chip collor for now. Don't Skip levels, if you play all missions you'll have more than enough chips to buy whatever suits you. I dont recommend Power-Leveling unless you already played all the missions on another Alternative Character AKA Alt. Its best to stay within the lines of all Factions until you know which Faction is best for you.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Update 1/13/14  Auction House: Used to sell whatever Items that are tradable, though most people I have noticed that are new to this game even older members tend to get two things confused at times, first. Remember that theres differences between Not Tradable and Not sellable. Not tradable means exactly what it means, you can't trade it with other members of the game like yourself, and Cannot be sold, means you can't sell that item to the Merchants in-game. This doesnt mean you can't place this in the AH unless it states its both Not Tradable and can't be sold. If it just says cant be sold, you can trade the item with players but cant sell it to the merchants. if the item says it cant be traded but doesnt say it cant be sold, that means you cant trade with Players but you can sell it to Mercs. If both are displayed, best th8ing to do is either two things, stash it somewhere or right click the item to delete or Scrap it for parts, if given that Option.  Most players have a hard time figuring out where best to scavenge loot, whether its for crafting or selling. Try looking in the outskirts of Embry, Oilvile, Pass Chris and other towns, Oilvile contains alot of Copper and Lead deposits for example.  Waypoints. Waypoints is VERY important in this game if you have a hard time keeping track of where your favorite spots are, rather its for looting and killing. To use Waypoints go to your Menu and locate the name Waypoints click it to open another window you can create a Waypoint or Add another. To create your own you can locate your Radar and click the globe icon to bring up your strategic map, from there, you can uncheckmark the Overhead to view detailed Information of where your at, and you can right click where ur Marker is at to add a waypoint, you can edit name to easily find it in your Waypoints Manager Window.  Copy recipe Links or AH links to Chat Windows  If you are near a AH or chatting in a Chat Bar, you can link recipes by going to Menu locating your Recipes and find the desired recipe and look at the bottom of your recipe, you will see an icon that looks like Shuffled cards, next to that icon is a chat bubble you click that to add it to any Recently Active Chat windows, then Enter it to show Full recipe to someone, But NEVER shout out recipes in the HELP section, since this will get you muted or possibly banned from Help for Spamming in the Help channel. Just like Adding Recipes you can also just directly link the Item itself rather the full recipe which is useful in the Auction Channel so you dont spam and make anyone mad. To do so, locate any recipe, find the actual item you want to craft, look at the Icon of the Item point your cursor to the thumbnail of it and you will see a Red pin like picture in the picture of it, you will then notice it will show a detail information of it, when it does that, hold down your Ctrl Button down on your keyboard and click your left click on your mouse to see it directly link to your active Chat Window. Works great for asking in the Auction Channel when saying WTB or Wanting/Willing To Sell  Update: 7/17/2014  Some have been using the word Pay2win and thinking that just because you clear an area of enemies they respawn too quickly that it needs improvement, truth be told, yes the game does need improvement... but Name one game you played that doesnt need it. People that use the word Pay2win, you dont pay2win in this game, if you are refering to using In-Game Chips that are free in the game then its not Pay2win, its Working2win, you have to work to get money within the game to buy/make weapons etc. sure you can use the AH to buy weapons, but you arent using RL money to do so, unless you are paying RL money for Chips which isnt legal within the game, and yes the Marketplace have decent items that you can buy to trade off for chips within the game if you choose so, but you dont need Chips, you need Intellegence and good manners. Befriend the right people within the clans and you will always most likly get free help or get free items just for being Pendant and friendly. Karma goes a long ways. Now as far as Enemies appearing too quickly after death, think of this as the Prison in Kingman in Sector 1, its designed this way to give you more of an edge, which opens up the ability of having to rely on Friends/Team Work. Social Skills at best. If you are a loney, best advise check your build make a good power build for Solo Missions. Skip Hard missions for a low end Toon and go back later and beat that mission when your Character is stronger in the level.  Best of luck and happy playing.  This game is worth playing at least once
7498	1	a	Given my extensive play time I figured it's about time I leave a review for this game.   I'd like to start off with this game is not pay2win, PvE/Missions can be pretty fun given you're teamed with the right people - but generally the rewards are awful. The crafting system is pretty neat but has a few flaws with some recipes are odd given their level as well as some new endgame gear rendering some materials and gears utterly useless.   PvP is pretty fun but it's not what it once was so you'll see a lot of people reminiscence about the old days. The community is probably the biggest killer for this game, most of which just whine about anything and everything. If you're looking for a post apocalypse game to play casually, then Fallen Earth may be it. The first few levels can be boring though but if you can bear through that then you're in for a good time.
7500	1	a	I'm a veteran on this game so i came here to tell the new players the real face of Fallen Earth. At the start you might have some problems with the player community, trolls are all over the help channel and thats a problem that the GM's are always trying to prevent without much success. As you level up you start to make friends and enemies, specially when you join a faction, leveling up is the best part of the game and the world is huge, there are many ways to level up, you just have to choose the one you like. The real problem of the game are the community and the administration, about the community most of the players are rude and trolls, that's a fact, about the administration, some of the gm's are extremely rude and not polite, and the game doesn't seem to have a anticheat engine, i was banned once just because i was part of a clan that had 1400 players and 1 or 2 were cheating, they did like 'idk who is cheating so lets ban everyone'. My account was unlocked because i never PvP and the cheaters were the PvP'ers, so joining a clan is not worthy and you are better alone. The old players are quitting or getting banned and the new players quit because of the trolls and lack of assistance, the game is dying very fast, but i still recommend this game for the good years that i spent there, i just wanted to prepare new players for what's coming for them :D
5119	0	a	Would rather be in an actual apocolypse than play this game.
7502	1	a	The poor man's Fallout online.  Well, not exactly, but hey, it ís free 2 play and it does have that post apocalyptic thing going on.  Either way, it's a pretty cool game. Lots of crafting and scavenging to get things done.  And the community is quite nice too.  The crafting system is pretty cool. While the first few items are quickly crafted, some things can take over a day. Luckilly the crafting still goes on while you're offline. From simple clubs, to a dune buggy, it can all be crafted... in due time.  This game is quite easy to solo in the first map, but after that, you might want to team up with some people as bosses get pretty heavy.  Another thing I did like about this game is the subscription system. It's not mandatory, and you can buy a months subscription any time. It gives a few bonusses, and when it's over it's over. Just like that. You can even buy them with in-game money.  The pvp fields however, are terrible. A broken system trying to balance things. Higher levels get a seriously unfair disadvantage, not balanced at all. Oh well, I'm not much of a pvp fan anyway...
7504	1	a	Can scavenge entire car into backpack. 10/10
7506	1	a	It's a good game, but it could be better.  The Bad... *Lack of server optimisation, PvP is sometimes a horrible experience because players strafe left and right to avoid damage because their hitboxes and character fly all over the place. *Lack of weapon variety in end-game. *Lack of useful weapons, some weapon stats are just better than the other. *Seen some clans camp newbies who enter PvP on accident. *Some mutation abilities are underpowered. *PvE enemies are predictable and boring to fight. *Character customisation is permanent (face, tattoos, paint, etc...) *Money, character, and crafting limit if you don't buy anything for real money. *Some skills seem underpowered because most abilities can hardcounter them (Dirty Tricks, Escape Artist, maybe a few more). *Loud bad player minority.  The Good... *Lots of build variety, be as special as you want to be or become a jack-of-all-trades. *3 Weapon skills to choose from - Melee, Rifle, Pistols (all with different pros and cons). *Mutations enhance your abilities. *Some body and character customisation. *Lots of crafting. *Helpful help chat. *Freedom to choose what kind of build you want. *Community is friendly. *Full game experience is cheap, buy something in the store and the money, craft, and character limit is gone forever (Max character limit in 'freemium' is 4)
7508	1	a	I'm recommending this, but not.  But why, you may ask? You have so much time in it, surely it's got something going for it?  It does. Thing is, the game is pretty much an excersize in unrealized potential. The environments look samey, until you go out of your way and find lovingly crafted areas people will never bother with.  The combat is clunky, if functional, and regularly gets screwed with by poor skill and item balancing.  The setting is actually surprisingly good, and there actually is an underlying story that you can play through at your own pace that is, shock and awe, actually pretty genuinely interesting, especially for your average scifi buff.  Noticing a theme? There are some wonderful ideas, but for whatever reason, they just never quite pushed them far enough. The game is sandbox-y enough to be impressively wide open, but they didn't quite cut away from MMO Theme Park syndrome.  The crafting system is amazingly wide, allowing you to make damn near everything in the game just from things you can get yourself, except for the necessary endgame things that require asinine boss grinding or broken pvp point grind.  Honestly it's getting depressing to talk about. It's one of those things that could have been flat out amazing, and for whatever reason, it just falls short. Still, it's the only modern MMO I've been able to stomach for any length of time, so there's that.
7510	1	a	Im playing Fallen Earth since it went Free2Play, and i must say you wont like this game if you cant deal with the fact that there no dragons and elves here !  Fallen Earth is an MMOFPS that may look boring at first, but as soon as you get into it you will love it more and more.  im currently level 55, and Fallen Earth is not the game that will be boring after reaching this level, the way to level 55 ( the level cap ) is long and can be sometimes even boring, but you will feel very satisfied. The are factions in the game, which you have to choose one, depends on your playstyle. you can help your faction in PVP which really fun aswell ! really balanced and fun PVP !  you can't go wrong with this game, no Pay2Win here ! of course you have a marketplace that you can buy stuff from it, but its clothing, vehicles and pets. if you dont want to spend real life money you dont have to ! every month you getting reward points that you can buy all these stuff and even more ! the game is Play2Win, the more you play the better you get !  Edit: THIS IS FALLOUT ONLINE, really recommended to all fallout fans out there !  My score : 10/10
7512	1	a	Possibly the most creative MMO I've ever played...now if we could just get the developers to stop ignoring the fan base and fix the content...
7514	1	a	A pretty damn good game. It doesn't have the best graphics, but it has a lot of content and has a nice atmosphere. You have plenty stuff to do and the maps are great. Wide open lands where you need pretty long to get across. You also have the possibility to teleport to certain points. Don't get irritated by it's bad reviewing quote, but many (kids/)players don't get the game and want fast action. Many of the young players are used to very low quality but fast action games like CoD, but this game has very much content and a pretty good quality. It just needs a little bit of time to get used to the game.
5125	0	a	I was a fanatic for this game, I couldn't get enough, clearly. It WAS a great game many years ago but as it was expanded and the combat system was changed several times the game became unbalanced with every change. The current build sytem defeats the purpose of builds since it's either one extreme or the other, no balance. PvP died several years ago due to all of this. So there was PvE for a while but the game went from 100's of players online @ all times to about 100 and it's down to about 50 or less, because most of the 50-75 online are AFK. PvP zones are dead, I should have quit several years ago, but I'm a diehard.   It's free to play but now ridiculous grinding to get the best weapons and armor to be able to duel. You'll need an overwhelming build just to compete. The game is nothing but CTF and duels between a few players that are playing some other game than what it was intended to be. You could check it out but don't expect it to be anything other than ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and grinding just to get the equipment and stats to compete with 2-5 players.   The game is dead, I'm not exagerating, it's on life support. It's pay to win but there's no reason to put any money into it, they're just sucking it dry before they shut it down.   Yes I'm still playing it sadly, haven't been able to find a game with the veteran community this game has. It's all about the nostalgia for me, kicks and giggles. I'll be playing until it's shut down, I'm an addict, I need help. :D
5126	0	a	Fallen Earth is an MMORPG that doesn't have a lot to offer in terms of combat, environments, mounts and interesting gear.  NOTE: My character is only level 17 after the time that I've played. This review is based on my 56 hours total that I've played.   Combat:
7516	1	a	This game is great if you like fallout, crafting, and farming things. Its a great way to pass time waiting for Fallout 4. It gets alot of bad reviews from people who failed to understand its mechanics and give it the time needed, i think. It is very complex, and takes a bit of effort to get into it, but if you dont give up on it and try to find your info, you will thrive even for free. The story is amazing, i dont like reading the 'quest text' but in this game I do because it is actually interesting. People in the game are friendly and helpful. Its not the most populated MMO, which is a shame, but its a very good game if you like the theme. The map is huge, and even though most of it is quite plain, you keep running into interesting artifacts. In general, I do recommend this game to anyone who has atleast a bit of passion for post apo theme.
5127	0	a	I played this game years ago and it was excellent. Crafting, questing, faction and clan PVP were all great. Not to mention the setting, massive world, rares, auction house, arena, and little out of the way places farther into the map that were just cool. Taking my interceptor for a spin and roaring past noobs on horses or swerving up and taking out some troll bullying noobs with the PVP setting on... Then the original developers sold it to the free to play people who started making drastic changes with minimal insight and ruined the whole thing. Then they built their F2P moneyfarm scheme on top and now you have the fallen earth mmorpg available to you today.
7518	1	a	I wish Bethesda would make fallout online :) this game is as close to it as you can get.
7520	1	a	First thing I have to say, if your a social gamer, then get this game. It's free to get. It's free play. Pretty much the only frustrating con to being a free player is having only one crafting queue slot and the 9 red chip (poker chips are currency and which you have white blue red and yellow chips) max. Do a couple free surveys and earn some GamersFirst credits and you can buy something cheap on the marketplace and get rid of the chip limit and up your crafting queue to like 4.   Alright now that I got that out of the way lets see what's next. I guess I could talk about the game state as of these past couple of weeks. This is an older game. The graphics aren't the best. But I like them. It feels as though the game has died a little bit inside and there are actually times in which a town can be empty of players, beside the couple stragglers that leave their player online and craft (it's not required to do so but if you use a crafting accelerator item it is). This is no elses fault but of your own though. IF you play people will play more often.    I enjoy the crafting system if I may say so myself. You can pull up a window that has a neatly organized (well somewhat :P) list of everything you have learned to craft. Just click it then the 'craft' button and it adds it to the crafting queue, as long as you have the required materials of course. Pretty much almost everything in the game has been crafted by another person. Whether it be vehicles or your favorite gun, or even that kebab that's been sitting in your inventory. Of course you get generated items through merchants or missions but this game allows for the better quality items to be instead crafted, thus relying on peoples ability to craft for a good economic system.    Lets see, what's another major characteristic about the game. Oh the pvp. Pvp/pve is pretty balanced throughout the game. Most places you are at are pve locations. There are locations that are strictly PVP. You can turn on pvp and fight in pve areas. You can turn off PVP (has a timer buff as to keep people from shooting and switching) and not be bugged in PVE areas. You can also simply just choose to duel someone and lose at low hp without actually dieing. There is even a window to queue up for Blood SPorts pvp minigames.   Like I said this game is very social dependent to have fun, unless your one of those people who just like to be off in a secluded location and grind through all your levels. Which in that case you can do that to on here:P. As said before the game is old , but in it's time it has made it very playable. It has it's bugs sure but what game doesn't. I barely see any of those 'hackers' as kids like to call them nowadays. Most of time it's kiddie stuff like the auto bot script stuff.   I think that about sums up the major points of the game. I could go on more about it, just don't feel like it. :P I hope I have influenced atleast one more player to join. Could use a couple more newbies that I could pick on. 
7522	1	a	I looked at this game yesterday on steam and already knowing its an old game something inside of me told me to give it a try, its free, why not? I like MMO's after all..........  My verdict after playing for just over an hour is that I don't regret downloading this game at all.  It has every aspect of MMO's i enjoy and endless levels of character and clothing customisation. You even get to create your own vehicles which i haven't done yet because i'm just starting out, I did however get a horse to ride though.  Set in a post apocalyptic world where you play as a clone, you set off on your own adventure. Making friends and enemies, it's up to you to fight, craft and survive the world before you.  The tutorial may feel like a little bit of a drag but hang in there its a great game once you pass the tutorial, don't skip it though, there are a lot of useful tips and lessons to be learned here, skipping the tutorial will leave you feeling lost and puzzled whilst playing the actual game.  Saw a few comments in the discussions of people complaining that the game was dead, not true, i've met plenty of people in my short play and even had a duel with one.  I recommend this game. It's free, why not?
5133	0	a	The story honestly bores me, so I decided lets do what I do in fallout, and explore, no, just no, desert, desert, desert, cactus, big scorpion you insta-kill, three hours later, and what am I looking at? More desert and killing a insta-dead scorpion, but in the distance I see a bandit, and next to him is a scorpion, apparently they're bros...
5134	0	a	I have plenty to say about this game. Some good, some bad.    For starters lets start with the story... there isnt one. Dont play this game if you like mmorpgs that have stories. Its just not there. What story there is is poorly executed. Having played on two different accounts and started in two different regions of the starter map, the story is boring. Frankly I'm more intrigued in the happenings of each NPC settlement than the actual story of your individual character.     Next the world itself. Be forwarned if you do not, and repeat DO NOT invest in any form of transportation (i.e faster horses and cars) you will not have a fun time. It is a gigantic walking sim otherwise. Other than that the world is freaking huge (clocked a 1.5 drive with a dune bug from zone 1 to zone 4 on a road) There is plenty to do, plenty to mine, and plenty to kill. There are a assortment of missions (will discuss details later) dotted all across the landscape. And the landscape itself isnt that much of an eyesore even at high settings. But sometimes when traveling in a dungeon it seems it takes FOREVER just to reach the boss (which has been stated before in other reviews to be bullet sponges, which is very true.) So there are no real pros or cons with this.   Crafting is an interesting part of the game, though from when i first started has changed drastically when i first started this game. When I first started as a free to play player, I could craft as much as i want without limits, although it has some flaws. For instance if you ever wish to progress a specific skill some have to be bought if you cant make the skill book yourself, you must buy it with in game money. Why gripe about this you wonder? BECAUSE THE BOOKS ARE OVERPRICED AS HELL! True you can grind for a couple hours and start selling stuff you get to get the money or make different stuff to sell at the auction house (I'll discus this later.) And the process of leveling up each skill gets me the most. You can craft the most difficult item or the most basic (to a cap) and you only get one skill point per item you craft for each specific crafting tree. Another flaw was most likely implemented after I stopped playing the game for a while. Right now for free2play players you can only craft a single item at a time, which was reallly frustrating for me since I started with being able to craft as many items as i wanted in a que. Other than this the crafting system is engaging for those willing to spend time with it and most resources are easy to get.   Character creation isnt really that important but i will discuss it. There is some variety in how you create your character, though it could have done a little better. Combined with the crafting system you can make your character look pretty cool. Character progression is an entirely different story. If you really want this game i will give you a few hints:   1) Invest in the mutations. These mutations will help you greatly in pvp and pve combat, greatly increasing your chances of survival for your fellow players and killing your enimies. Pick wisley though. You either want to invest in crowd control and healing or full on offense with negative buffs. never invest in both it will take forever to get anything useful.  2) invest in one and only one weapon skill. As someone who tends to try to be a jack-of-all trades in mmos dont try to invest in multiple weopon skills (unless you really want to.) Pick one maybe two and stick with it becasue the stats of your weapon skills and another skill (i.e Rifle skill with precision skill) determines your dmg ratio.  As for the skills themselves along with the mutation skills, there are way to many skills. Sure you have plenty of skill points to spend; 'the total amount your character can have spent on them level 55 is 1960 AP.'  (febase.mmometaguide.com/ss-1/)  However this would take forever. My highest lvl character is 49 and that took the majority of hours i put into this game. All in all character progression without the pay2win experience isnt worth for free2play players.   The community is a hard topic to describe. It does have the common trolls and mean clans galore with a few diamonds in the rough. The mass majority of players when i first strarted were some of the nicest perople i have ever met in any mmo experience. I was in a really large clan that had four different offshoots coming from all six of the factions the game. Of course this was my first experince. After my second go at the game the community had pummled down to nothing more than a bunch of trolls. Thats all I have to say about that.   The economy is my last subject. The economy is by far the most annoying part of this game. Unlike WOW which has a real fluctuating economy, Fallen Earths economy is set in stone and is overpirced. For all the lowest tier items (scrap) they are expensive for a world that doesnt genrate money for loot on hostile NPCs. Unless you grind for hours like i did and make and sell a whole bunch of loot and items you will be poor as the bum that lives on your nearest street corner. Also beware for those who do join or make a clan, protect your clan vault as if it were your most important valuable in your life. I have heard countless stories of clan members stealing huge stacks of loot, materials, and thousands of in game money and leaving the clan. Although unimportant to the economy it had to be said. A final note, the auction house is a joke. There are obvious players being trolls trying to sell a rare item (mind you for only a single piece) at a unreasonably high amount of chips (in game money.) Though there are some reasonable people like myself who focus on creating stuff or collecting loot to get our wealth by actually being fair in our prices in the auction house.  All in all Fallen Earth is a below average mmo as it stands right now. There are some bugs here and there, but they do a good job at fixing them. The graphics are mediocre at best and the progression is skewed by the common pay2win in most free2plays.
5135	0	a	Fallen Earth was my favourite MMORPG. But it's way to old, pay-to-win and unsupported now. The 6-faction PVP, no classes, super-deep crafting, horses and vehicles, wide open world, and best of all free aim made is awesome for its time. Too weird that the developing company went bankrupt after making the best MMORPG! Show me another open world, free aim MMORPG when you can take long-range sniper rifle headshots from horseback or gun down your foes with a submachine gun while zooming past on the motorbike you just crafted... We NEED Fallen Earth II, but it's not coming. The first game is just old and empty now...
5136	0	a	All this game has going for it is its setting. Everything else is quite barebones. The survivor settlements aren't interesting, the combat engine is boring mmo combat that tries to hide in FPS combat's trousers, the missions are mostly fetch quests and now it also has a bunch of free to play micro-transactions that really don't make it any better. I was really excited for this when it got announced, I wanted a true post-apocalyptic MMO, sadly, this is just not it.
5137	0	a	The uninstall button worked. Nothing else.
5138	0	a	THIS GAME LURES YOU ON WITH A GOOD IDEA AND THEN ♥♥♥♥♥ IN YOUR FOOD HOLE.
7524	1	a	For a F2P (yes you can totally play without spending a cent) it has to be one of the best MMORPG's.  The in-game community is great, very helpful, there are ALOT of newbies so as far as i'm concerned the game is far from dead. Sure graphics are dated but graphics don't make a game, gameplay makes a game and this has plenty of that. Love the crafting and customisation and the fact you can't just wade into a mob of enemies 20 lvls above you with a bat and come out smelling like roses. Totally worth it.
5140	0	a	Just buy Fallout
7526	1	a	Feels like an old school MMO. More social based with laid back gameplay.  Good enviroment, captures the feeling of a wastland. Older graphics that still hold up, as we know graphics aren't everything, and runs well on older machines. That said, PvE is very simplistic. Plays as a very basic FPS. I'm not a PvPer. If that is your cup of tea, there does seem to be many active PvPer in the game.  Crafting is a lot like Star Wars Galaxies, in the sense that most everything is player made. Player driven economy. Unlike Star Wars Galaxies, it is also very simplistic. Gather materials, click button, wait until done. No different qualities of materials, or experimenting on items, all gear is the same. (I use SWG as an example, as I think it had the best crafting that hasn't been matched yet in a MMO, IMHO) If you plan on making all your own gear, prepare to level slowly, as crafting take a longer time to keep up to date.  Fair free to play model. Pay to unlock cosmetic options or xp boosts, nothing really game changing sold in the shop.
7528	1	a	This is by far one of the best free to play games, similar to fallout and defience with a dynamic crafting system and simple but unique combat system.  It's also got a whoping 600+ achievemnts and endless amounts of quests, lots of mounts too from horses to off-road vehicles.  sorry that's all I can say, it's hard to configure a review for a game of this magnitude.
7530	1	a	Fallen Earth isn't the most polished game out there, but hey, it's free, so what do you expect? Okay, so the interface and AI are pretty clunky and without buying premium you're limited to certain items, levels, etc...  Despite these cons, Fallen Earth is surprisingly fun and immersive. The ability to do basically whatever you want, be it quest, scavenge, grind, or fight other players in PvP, is what makes Fallen Earth so addicting. No matter your level there is always something to do or something new to discover. Heck, even though I have 150+ hours into this game I'm still questing in the first sector and I'm barely past Level 19. This shows how much there is to do.  Overall, I would recommend this game to someone who is patient enough to get used to the clunky UI and look past the cons of this game. It's not your typical plug-n-play shooter types, and that's what I love about this game. Plus, it's free, and for $0.00 this is one hell of an escape.  9/10, -1 for cons mentioned above
7532	1	a	This Game is great even at this age one of the best mmos out thier the community is nice the gameplay is diffrent.........So many things to do     10/10
5144	0	a	See that play time up there? That's how much it took me to log in. (I still haven't btw)  If you try to use your Steam details, it ♥♥♥♥s with you saying that you have to use your Steam details. If you try to use GamersFirst details (Their website), you will be told that you entred the wrong account details and try to go to your GamersFirst profile to find out that you DONT ACTUALLY HAVE A USERNAME, and only 1 hour later you will find out that youre on the wrong website and you have to go on a different GamersFirst website, all about Fallen Earth. Then you find out your username is something like:  G1-764f4caf-383e-49ff   (no joke)  And the password you have entered has been viewed by administrators so they're like, '♥♥♥♥ this password! Lets give him another one!' and you find out that your password is COMPLETELY DIFFERENT and you go to change it. You go back to GamersFirst and find out that your password is the same as it was.    What   The   FUCUCK!?
7534	1	a	this game is fun but if your like me then you will need friends to help you get all the crafting done...  i need friends...
7536	1	a	3.3 hours in, i've gotten far, i didn't care much about the character played with friends, got a horse we were average leveled (long time, just redownloading, i know we were the same level as almost everyone else) there was this fenced off pvp zone heck yes go inside, rekt some noobs heading back to horse &gt;it was dead someone killed our horse. we knew who it was, because we heard them in chat we hunted them down they were on an intense mission which conveniently cut through a pvp zone it would send him back to the nearest town if he died, which was about 10 minutes away. we cut through, blocking him off 'oh sht' is what he said we killed him he raged, and deleted the game i love this game.

7538	1	a	Got me through some difficult times in the past, made many friends from everywhere too, I still pop in sometimes to see them.  Shame it's dying out, really good, I have many more hours than it says above.
5147	0	a	First of all, I have played this game hundreds of hours outside the steam via the game's own launcher. So I know every aspect of the game, literally every single one.  The game itself is good. But it is abandoned by developers, thus doesn't have lots of players.  You can still play it as PvE and have lots of fun.  But if you are thinking about getting into PvP, it is Pay to Win as hell. And you will have some trouble finding opponents, as there aren't so many players around.
7540	1	a	waiting simulater 2015. still havent played it. 11/10
5148	0	a	Played it when it first came out, loved it for it's unqiue experience and environment/atmosphere at the time, was frustrating at first trying to figure out how to play it properly but fell in love with it. Than some staff quit and the game was given to a different company, they dumbed it down in my opinion, skillset combinations became simplified and not as exciting or interesting as they were previously which in the short run made me quit.  If they brought back the original way skills were I'd probably play again but I know that will never happen just like me giving my money to this game will never happen.  Thumbs up for the original Fallen Earth, thumbs down for what it is now.  
7542	1	a	Pros: Interesting take on post-apocalypse survival. Decent gameplay for a F2P title. Varied environments. Decent learning curve. Great concept and presentation.  Cons: PS2 graphics. Slightly janky animations. Combat isn't smooth or well paced and respawn rates are too high.
7544	1	a	decent game to play ,especially with friends
7546	1	a	Most people will look at this game and say 'Ugh, looks old', or they will look at the reviews and go 'Oh, Mixed.' And leave the page, i am here to tell you that this game is VERY worth your time.  Most people want straight statistics so here they are: Pros: A fallout style world with an incredible amount of things to explore. A decent combat systems with hundreds of skills and almost THOUSANDS of weapons you can craft, find or buy. A BEYOND enormous map with hundreds upon hundreds of different types of enemies to kill. A brilliant scavenging system, you can find piles of all types of junk, plants, and graves all around the map, all are lootable and all have a wide variation of items. A fairly decent storyline, the likes of which you won't find in many other games.  Cons: A pretty dead PVP system, there are still some who play this, but good luck finding a PVP match, and if you do, you will get destroyed by high-level people. ....that's pretty much it.  I know i make this game sound amazing, that's because it is, if you look past the SLIGHTLY dated graphics for an mmo, (Even now they are pretty damn decent.) If you look past the lack of people, this is still a brilliant mmo to play, and even today you will find massive enjoyment from it.
7548	1	a	Even after many years, I still reccomend this game as a F2P title. For free, you get access to pretty much everything. Really, the only thing extra you that is worth a damn as a paying customer is the extra xp gain. Leveling is quite tedious and slow.   So if you don't know anything about FE then here we go: FE is a post apocalyptic MMORPG developed by Reloaded. I think the original developers went bankrupt shortly after the release of FE like 6 years ago and Reloaded picked it up. FE survived for awhile but the player base quickly diminished. This is due to a few factors. Rampant hacking in PVP and a poor interface and content supply. PVP hacking is something I personally have never experienced because I never pvp. To PVP, you must go to a specified area. Apparently there are aimbot hacks used there that give hackers an easy 1 shot kill to the head. Since this is a skill based game which active targeting, you can see why players are angry with this. The developers have shown to not care at this point and just allow it.  FE is on life support at this point but still a playable game. People are obviously still pumping the publisher with revenue and some people even have a $30/month subscription. The combat is FE is very active and somewhat exciting because you have to aim at the head to do maximum damage. I think full loot PVP would be an even better addition to this but it'll never happen. The developers barely push out content and i think the last major content update was 3 years ago. So, the publisher is just milking this game for whatever is left, like a vulture. Still a good game to waste some time in.  Here is my review from 2015  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qJXFMIyxnk 
7550	1	a	I'm really suprised this game has a mixed rating, because it's a very good one! This game isn't for who are looking a good graphics, it is focused on gameplay, interaction and etc... I really don't like RPG games for true. I like games like Gta, but somehow, this game made me be curious and i really decided to download it, and see what would happen. In first minutes, you don't have any clue, any idea of what you have to do and this is the part where a lot of players give up to the game, because almost no one'll help you thought your adventures. You have to have patience, this is the best part of the game. You will be discovering new stuffs, new things to collect, new NPC'S by yourself. The is game is fully of players in almost every part of the map. You have an unexplainable freedom to do whatever you want, and you can do the quest any time you wish. The main thing that made me like this game, is the fact you can have a bike, a car or a horse. there's a good number of vehicles, Atv's and etc.. You can repair your vehicles, paint them, you have to feed your horse, youo have a garage. You can trade your stuf with players or sel them to some specific NPC'S. You'll be playing GTA and dark souls at same time, because this game is very hard.   Why this is a very good game:  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  *** YOU WON'T LOOSE ANY OF YOUR VEHICLES, ITENS OR WEAPONS IF YOU DIE AT ANY PLACE OF THE GAME. *******  - If you die, you won't need to walk hundred of kilometers to pick up you vehicle again. There are some bases near some quest places you can spawn, and you can take your vehicle back easily where you left before be killed.  - Wasn't made for who is looking for a good graphics game. Fallen Earth, is focused on gameplay.  - Unexplainable freedom.  - It's a very hard game, you must have patience and sense of exploration, or you'll give up easily.  - You can play GTA and Dark Sould at same time, choosing if you want to be a casual player, or a high level monster killer.  - You can fight against other players, while defending or invading a base.  - You can craft a lot of stuff, since a simple clothes or even an expensive car.  - You can scavenge stuffs.  - You can do some quests that require a higher level, but of course, you'll die easily.  - Very good interaction.  - You have a lot of skills to improve. Also, you'll earn XP points, and you can spend it upgrading your skills.  There's a lot of things, but you need to play a lot of time to find out. This is just a 1000 square kilometers map!
7552	1	a	Aside from the clunky controls, the odd but fun (not modern) gameplay (ragdoll physics, actual aim, decent graphics,...), this game is probably the best free to play 'fallout-ish' game I can recommend to anyone. The core apocalyptic elements are present and the game works the best as it is. Give this a try, it's free after all.
5150	0	a	Game was great, but its dead now, nothing but old OLD players who are too ignorant to give it up, and new players who run around for a day or two before realizing its dead and quiting too. Used to be great though one of the few good shootings mmos
5151	0	a	5.2 hours in launcher  best game 10/10
7554	1	a	fun, easy to get used too, but feels like crafting is too much of a hassle
7556	1	a	This game is quite good for its age and hardware requirements. The open world maps are huge and designed using topographical satellite imaging data producing a varied, immersive environment spanning over a reported 1k+ kilometer area. Fallen Earth (FE) posseses the most expansive crafting systems I have ever seen allowing players the opportunity to create a vast array of items including the basics like armor, weapons and healing/food stuffs. This title offers solo &amp; team based play for co-op (PvE) and PvP in addition to clan membership and a friend system.  The game may not host an online player presence comparible to other titles like Dota, but is still adequately populated supporting player co-op. FE demands little by way of hardware and its file size is still small enough that anyone remotely curious about trying it out should; if it doesn't appeal after a test run uninstall it and carry on with less hassle than some other titles. If your into titles like Fallout 3 and Borderlands then there is a good chance that Fallen Earth will appeal to your inner wasteland survivalist instincts.  In closing and on a humorous note, I choked on my coffee when I realized Fallen Earth had over 600 achievements; yes FE has that many achievements and all relevant indicating an involved play through lie ahead. The game is has all manner of missions, side-missions and grind easing out boredom on rainy days in a low impact, rewarding way. I have grown to enjoy Fallen Earth in the short time I've spent playing it and will continue thus recommend the game. For what it does it does so in a cost effective manner from free to cash shop without heavy nagging or a self a destructive pay-to-win brand.
7558	1	a	Suprisingly enough, this game is extremely addicting. Once you get far in it, its REALLY fun!
7560	1	a	Fallen Earth is a very fun and unique game, it has a lot of features such as mining rocks and scavaging in rubbish piles...with the copper you mine from rocks you can craft into bullets. You can also lvl up geometry skill which will allow you to mine higher lvl rocks and get more resorces from them, as far as pvp goes i have yet to try it out. I find that melee is a good skill to start lvling up right away because it can become handy later on, also the quest system is nice filled with different varieties and you never feel as if you have done the same quest more that twice.The map is HUGE and would take hours to explore and going out past a certain point you will find that enemies will get tougher very quickly which will force you to lvl up before exploring more which is good because when you die from a hard enemy and then go lvl up a little bit when you go back to that same enemy you feel like you are getting stronger and making progress towards you'r character. I very much enjoy a few hours a day of fallen earth and would easily give it an 8/10 for mmo standards. I have not seen many fps open world mmorpg's around and this is quite the package if you are looking for a game like this.
7562	1	a	this game is like if you went into a hot topic and then the world ended
7564	1	a	Hahah, it's free to play now.
7566	1	a	loved the game and the concept had many many hours of fun and exciting events
5156	0	a	So, this here is a quite typical MMORPG, made by Gamers First, so if you are gonna download it, you are going to have to make a user to play. It's not meant to be that realistic, it's a god-dang mmorpg for christ's sake. Examples; Enemies can melee you with a corkscrew from 10 meters. You kill a flock of prearie chikens (a mutated chiken that has nothing in common with an actual chiken) and any of them won't defend each other. A custom made Closet Rod is more deadly than a sledge hammer. And the enemies will kill you if you try to flee from combat, like they will not simply stop following you.   The good thing in the game is that it isn't Pay 2 Win, althought outside the safe zones it's full pvp war out there. Most of the games weapons and armors/clothing is usually made by YOU. That's right. Crafting takes a huge part in the game, as you make a ragged t-shirt from cotton and such. Later on you can craft better equipment from better ingedients etc. As usual, you'll get better in scavenge, harvest and skin skills by using them constantly. It can be quite dull at times, sure.  In the short version, this combination of S.T.R.I.K.E.R. and fallout has potential, but that's about it. It takes way too much effort to get it working, and even then you will ask your self, was it worth it? See for yourself, it's free anyway.
7568	1	a	Yeah its a little out dated here and there but its a huge open world mmo rpg. You can do whatever you want before touching the missions/quests. Crafting is great and yeah its a grind but do you want things handed to you? Or do you want to feel proud about hacking down 1000 mutant chickens to get said equipment? Way under the table and I feel like this game needs to be spoken about. Try it, what do you have to lose? Sooo many things you can do and build/craft/grow.. Still cant make that more clear! Alright I'm done.
7570	1	a	First of all I do say that metacritic got the score right for once.  I like it overall, but has some (a lot) of problems. I am going to start with them first.  --NEGATIVE THINGS--  -The game hasen't been updated since November of 2014, which is horrible at the game's current state.  Edit: The game is still updated, but it's only for the marketplace and not for the bugs...  -Lots of minor bugs  -The crafting times can get ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ for F2P players  -Unlike most MMORPGs, you cant choose to be an evil bandit of the wastes, which reminds me...  -Did I mention that the game feels more like the western times with a cloning mechanic thrown into it?  -The game seems rushed, the spawn points for enemies are just thrown around and oftenly crammed  ++POSITIVE++  +Clear tutorial  +Finally, an MMORPG where I can actually stand playing in firstperson  +Decent gunplay, no broken hitboxes or any sort of bug  +Actually playable for a F2P game  ~~NEUTRAL~~  ~The game is at the bottem of good for Graphics  Overall, don't play this game if you either don't like or don't care for MMORPGs, then you will hate them even more. As for the people who do, Try the game; I don't expect you to like it, just try it.
7572	1	a	Played the game since Beta and I have enjoyed throughout. For the games ****y exploits and the various bugs, glitches and what-not, it can actually be playable. As lots of other reviews have said, 'The community is ♥♥♥'.. It's not too bad if you're with the right people. The Player versus Enviroment is fun, very well balanced but I can't say the same about Player versus Player, it's not really something that is balanced. It's fun, sure.. But, not when you first start and you don't know what you're doing.  The starter quests are fun for a little while until they become repetative, but it's quite easy to get over that. For the thousands of quests there are, you can't really say 'I have nothing to do'. The huge world offers a wide variety of different enviroments to explore, some full of danger at every corner. As you progress throughout the game, you're going to need some help at some point. Implemented in the game is it's ability to create and join clans around the Grand Canyon. I like this aspect of the game, but, it's extremely 'NOT' lore friendly, I think.  For what is now a F2P game, it's worth it. I know I have missed things out but I don't want to ruin what Fallen Earth has on offer!
7574	1	a	I've spent so much time in this world, shame the game is dying. But I don't regret any of it, it's a great game.
5160	0	a	I remember this game very fondly. I spent plenty of time in game scav'ing for resources, playing in the pvp arena, joining up with clans, and roaming the province. It has a unique and very loveable style even though it was clearly trying to edge its way into the WoW market. When I played it was fresh out of beta, the developers were very close to the community. Even for the year or two I played that didn't change much. But then it just died. I'm not blaming the developers for selling the property to gamers first. You do what you gotta to stay afloat. But the change never took well. The community never talked to each other anymore. The only changes that were ever implimented were to make the microtransactions float and the f2p model more appealing. The content grew stale and dried out and eventually it became akin to the wasteland it portrays. I would not recommend this game to anyone new. Its a dried out husk of a community that once was and there's no chance of it ever coming back.
7576	1	a	Just started playing this game and love it!!!
5161	0	a	This game's graphics are decent, until you walk out of the first room. Then, all the walls disappear, and the game is unplayable.
7578	1	a	This game is a piece of art.   Developed by a pretty unknown studio the game has been being developed since 2006. It changed hands to Gamersfirst and the game has continued to be developed. (Gamersfirst might not be the best group to own the game but they keep it running)  The game is the culmination of a lot of different games that always got some things right but never went any further.  The game as a very robust crafting system with nearly 90% of the items found in game being craftable. (The other 10% is usually unique item drops or materials for crafting.)  The combat system while at times can be a bit wonky requires people to aim their shots and attacks (Something that a lot of people look for in an MMO today)  If you enjoy games like Fallout, Fallout 2, Fallout Tactics, Wasteland, or Wasteland 2 (This is in regards to the Genre and crafting/party system) Then this game is most likely going to fall into the Niche of games that you'll die for.   The game has a die-hard fan base that has kept it runing through the transitions and the bad times. The game has undergone a ton of updating and in the near future another sector will be added to the game. (Essentially another expansion.)  Many people discredit the game because of graphical glitches or a poorly designed tutorial. (Which graphics don't matter but the tutorial is credible.) Yet the game continues to find ways to bring people into the world.  The mythos of the game is incredible. The storylines are interesting and they dialogue is engaging. (Dialogue here meaning Text, you have to read =P ) I cannot find a lot to say about the game that is at fault.  PvP has consequences on the world and the Factions that battle it out are fun to engage with and make the game interesting to say the least with 'Politics' in game. The economy is for the most part player driven and this engages people even more that like to play the market.  All in all this game is a solid 7/10 and hell it's free, so what are you waiting for? GET OUT THERE AND MAKE ME PROUD! I'll see you in the wastes.
7580	1	a	This game is very unique and it was fun when i had it downloaded thinking of getiting it again!
7582	1	a	Pretty good for a free to play game, I would suggest trying it out but staying the hell away from all the freemium content.
5162	0	a	 Such a great potential, but sadly, wasted
7584	1	a	Strong playerbase and 100% free of cheaters. PvE is so dynamic and engaging, always something new and interesting every time you play. PvP is super active and easy to pick up, almost no learning curve at all. To top it all off it has an incredible economy, you can find almost anything you want in the Auction House at prices anyone can afford.
7586	1	a	Better with friends.
7588	1	a	horrible 
7590	1	a	awesome game i hope u all try it
7592	1	a	OMG Its cool, You get to enjoy time with friends and more Thanks 2 my friend WD3RD Im now back to playing it This day was the day I got the game again, I suggest it,   Try it out guys!
7594	1	a	The Population has seen much better days, but Fallen Earth remains on of the best, if not best, PvP-lite games on the market. Want intense pvp, with full aim and RPG elements (eg healing) but don't want to be fully looted when you die. Welcome to FE pvp,   If you don't want pvp, or RP then sorry FE falls really short the pve is poor at best with little challenge.   A great game that fans of play for years, and yet you can get a capped toon with full gear in less than a month, only thing that stands between you and a Vet player is the skill level and understanding of the combat system.
5164	0	a	A terrific MMORPG that lost its way.  The crafting is deep and interesting. The world is open and well crafted. It was in part a successor to Sony Online's long defunct Star Wars Galaxies. And it was really neat. Then bought out, then trashed by what should be a classic example of Pay to Win enacted in an mmo.  I tried it several times, but between the P2Win and what seemed to be an absolutely cliquesh community based on kissing the ♥♥♥ of either a GM or someone who was in good with a GM.  Sad, but true story, this game should have been top of the charts for a time when it released. And like other old mmo's, EQ2, etc., it should have aged better than it has been allowed to do.
7596	1	a	Good game, bad developers. No Updates, Nothing. True waste of time untill developers start doing something instead of milking money out from addicted players. ( My self as well sadly )
7598	1	a	I danced on a spawn point and got a red quality shotgun, and later got lit on fire by a lvl 6.  10/10 wouldd craft again.
7600	1	a	Challenging players to advance without telling them exactly how to do it is taboo in any game, but perhaps even more acutely taboo in an MMO. Many players may find the game confusing at first, and for others the combat will not be lively or vigorous enough, but as with any MMO these aspects can be improved over time. What will certainly not change is the inherent difficulty infused into the game by holding players responsible for their actions. This game isn't for everyone, and that may be the most compelling reason to try it for yourself.
7602	1	a	 I really like the idea of this game. You are a clone bent on either saving or destroying the post-apocalyptic world. The execution is one issue. Lack of players is another. I logged in on Saturday night, literally 54 people in game on the map the size of Kalimdor. I played last year without Steam account, 400+ people were online    Pros &gt;Very friendly players &gt;6 classes, 2 fractions (simply: Barbarian, Gatherer, Scout VS Soldier, Engineer, Priest) in reality its Barbarians vs Soldiers  &gt;Fighting mechanics like in Elder Scrolls Morrowind but with guns  &gt;Missions are plentiful and not boring. You often have to make a choice between two missions, you can only complete one and this will change your character's future &gt;Humorous content (Dark and Macabre Humor) &gt;Fast download, little bugs &gt;Free   Cons &gt;Only 4 types of Background will bore you to death &gt;Crafting takes forever(sometimes Hours to make an item) &gt;Building a vehicle or a house takes Weeks &gt;If you don't start honing your picking skills right away, you will fail  &gt;PVP is dead   6/10 Play it as if its an offline RPG before it kicks the bucket
7604	1	a	Play it, enjoy it, dont get bored, 10/10. Not a game for everyone though
5173	0	a	i like the game, i realy do, but there are some little problems that drive me insain. First is the leveling! Are you trying to be like runescape if so keep it up iv put 44 hours into this game and im still level 12, second is the crafting. Its way to hard to level up crafting. In some terms this game is more pay to be the best then play to have fun and enjoy the game. That is why im giving it a thumbs down becouse i think it needs a lot more work.
5174	0	a	While I love this game with my heart and soul, I can't recommend this game to ANYONE. First off, this is a free to play, MMORPG with more numerical values in skill points and microtrasactions than are reasonable in an MMO, RPG or not. If you are one of those people who can keep tabs on their progress every 20 seconds great, you 'might' like this game. Secondly, crafting takes the longest it should ever take you. Building a gun in the game takes about as long as a machine might take to calculate the numeric value of pi. I sat waiting for literal days, waiting for crafting items to finish. Third, after finding most of the beginning quests, you struggle to find more, leading you to take hours on the crappy little ATV you spent 5 days (real-time) to make, running strait into a PvP field, dieing instantly from a stray bullet or an overpowered NPC. Last but not least, there is the problem of buttons. I have never played a game where every key on your keyboard + keys you don't even have is/are used in game to perform simple tasks such as turning left.   I don't want this to sound like I'm griping about this game, but its just something where if you can deal with organized chaos you may have a chance to play this game, otherwise, stay clear of this game.
7606	1	a	this is good game
7608	1	a	well, not to far in this game, but its pretty good. It takes a bit to get into, but now that I have gotten to lvl 5 I think I have a decent feel for how it works. Its really an open do as you want thing, the missions at first are very drab feeling, but they teach you how to craft and give you plenty of good starting stuff. Although its a F2P, and does have a shop I have not found anything that is needed to buy. Most of the shop items are just cosmetic. No push to shop for items at all. The community has been really good to play with also. A dedicated HELP channel is the default for the chat channel and it has decent folks to help, and I have seen a good in game GM presence. One thing that is actually nice is they dont allow the chat to be overrun with garbage either. By that I mean like today, a guy was talking racist garbage and they shut him down ASAP.  SO overall, a bit slow to get started with, but well worth the time to try it out.  EDIT:  I have a bit more time in now, so thought I would add here. Its a pretty good game. The community has been great, the GM's are actually there, and I have not found anything in your face about having to buy anything from the store. Its not pushing any Pay 2 Win envelopes on you, and even in the PvP area I have finally felt good enought to go to, it was a good time. So far all the equipment I have seen is just as available to a F2Per as to a buyer. Seems they were smart in making the system so that instead of pay to win, you can pay to get something you may just not want to take the time to craft. No super weapons for the buyers only, no uberness in paying to win. The money is so far balanced also, its called Chips in game, and is based on Poker chips, and its not hard to find or sell stuff be it to merchants or other players and actually get some fair return. I was even amazed to see that the things I could buy at my current level on the AH were actually not some overpriced manipulated economy, I could afford them if I wanted them.  yep its a good time for a Free Download.
7610	1	a	Fallen Earth Pros:  -Amazing environment and immersion -Wonderful PvP gameplay -A rediculously good crafting system -A large ready-to-explore map to quench your need for adventure -55 levels with new gear no matter what you're at -Conveniantly placed merchants and fairly easy-to-master Fast Travel system for teleporting all over the map at low cost Auction prices that players post are generally fair*  Fallen Earth Cons: -The majority of the staff team needs work or improvement as far as moderation and fairness goes (this is prone to change whenever they may so improve) -The community is easy to get sucked into, and not in a good way, people tend to troll endlessly if you get them going, and they can go on for hours and never shut up due to mass amounts of self-pride and ignorance -Everyone types with their face -The Auction can sometimes become inflated but over-all it's fair*  Do I reccomend it? Yes! This game is unlike any other, and you can't say Fallout beats it because last I checked Fallout didn't have the balls to be an MMO! Let alone FREE TO PLAY YOUR WAY!
7612	1	a	Hard to understand things in a begining but after its going really interesting. 7/10
7614	1	a	Fallen Earth for me is like. The last 'You have to use your mind' game that isent like just pressing buttoms. if you like stuff like S.T.A.L.K.E.R. or Diablo i will happely Recommend this game Its not just about mashing your keyborad and paytowin. Its a fun hard work and coop game for most gamers you can do 2 thing 1. run around like a 1 eye monobrund mongol whit HIV and F*** all that gets in your way (Not Recommend) 2. Take it serius and make some good chips (Money) and get on a adventur whit friens and be cool (Recommend)
7616	1	a	If u like Fallout 3 ull LOVE! this. It takes a massive world, full of destruction and fear, full of crazed raiders. Its the perfect F2P fallout mmo
7618	1	a	brilliant game full of hours og adventuring
7620	1	a	well, not to far in this game, but its pretty good. It takes a bit to get into, but now that I have gotten to lvl 5 I think I have a decent feel for how it works.

5176	0	a	WASTE of space, many bugs.
7622	1	a	Good game in my opinion but it is a grind. graphics are a bit oudated but still fun non the less. 1 thing i dont like is when you die , you respawn in the same place so if you travel far , its a hassle to continue Over all 8/10
7624	1	a	In my opinion Fallen Earth is one of the best post-apocalyptic games out there. Wether you enjoy fighting, crafting, exploring on your motorbike or whatever - this game can deliver it. I myself really enjoy going out into the wilderness and scavenge old cars and microwaves for a huge variety of items to use in my crafting. The gamemasters are pretty much always there to help you as is the awesome community (most of them anyways). The combat is pretty straightforward and easy to learn, The skill 'tree' can be a bit difficult as a new player to understand but there are roadmaps to give you some idea where you should put your skill points. With the game being free to play there's a shop for microtransactions which does contain items that can help you quite a bit but nothing that would give a player a huge advantage over another in my opinion. Unfortunatly I don't know how limited the gameplay is as a free to play member but either way I would really recommend that you try out Fallen Earth - it does offer alot of fun.
7626	1	a	To put it simply:  If Fallout:New Vegas and Elder Scrolls Online had a baby, this would be it.
7628	1	a	You either love it or hate it. The map is vast and unique, be prepared to take long horse rides in the sunset. Fun with friends.
5177	0	a	Made my computer crash on the first try
7630	1	a	I used to have a Paid account for this game for a long time, then the F2P came and every 10 yearold on the planet got on the servers and the game went to ♥♥♥♥. Sad i loved this game and would pay for my account again to have it back to the way it used to be. I remember people used to help each other so much when we were all paying for the accounts. Last time i played this i asked someone for help and they basicly told me to go ♥♥♥♥ myself. Making the game free really took a ♥♥♥♥ on the player aspect of the game. People can say im wrong but if you never paid for an account to play this game you have no clue what im talking about. Im going to reinstall the game now prob 2 years after the F2P boom and hope its changed, The game itself is great, and no other game comes close to the depth of this game. Honestly i bet if they made servers that were paid accounts and kept the F2P ones on there own servers they would be surprised how many of us would still pay for the accounts. I MISS PAID ACCOUNTS !!! =*(
7632	1	a	Sometimes you have to go all the way across the map for a mission, just to get another mission then go all the way back again. And you have to go on a slow ♥♥♥ horse, ( I believe you can get a go-cart too which is way faster) For most of the time I played i got to see my horse's bum shake. 10/10
7634	1	a	I honestly love this game. It has a VERY steep learning curve, but once you get your bearings it is so worth it. You can go so far, in so many ways. Classes don't excist in the slightest, you can be everything from the dashing medic with a large rocket launcher, to the big brute with a spiked baseball-bat and telekinesis. Your options are about as big as your imagination. The setting is ver well done, even with graphical settings on low, it's lovely. I highly recommend it, so if anyone needs help with this game, add me as a friend, and I'll see waht I can do. Sleep tight, don't let the raiders bite!
7636	1	a	A very entertaining game if you're into riding around a hue map and collecting things, the graphics are absolutley beautiful which means running around the map is fine by me and the map is over 600 miles by proportion to the real world so its pretty massive for a free game... overall it's really fun for those who like beautiful scenery and killing things at the same time.
7638	1	a	enemys respawn faster then ever 10/10
5182	0	a	played this game on first realease before it had come to steam. i came back 3 years later to see if they had fixed anything and the AI is just so flipping bad it will make you want to off yourself. i wouldnt bother wasting time. i did enjoy the crafting system on a lighter note
7640	1	a	One of my all time favourites ! The wasteland at it's finest....
7642	1	a	I've put so much time and patience to this game and I gota admit that this game is AWSOME!!!!! sure that during this month and november that the game has some bugs. But that doesnt stop me of exploring each section in this mmo. It has the type of feeling of all the fallout series. Even the crafting recipes in this mmo is unbelievable!!! there are so many creation recipes you can make (armor,mounts,viechles, medicine, construstion, mutagenics, melee weapons, ballistic weapons etc...) the list keeps going on and on like for an eternity. Thats what makes this game awsome! Even the missions go on forever. And building your character has so many choices of what kind of character you want to be. It only takes time and patience of creating your character. Just give this game a chance if you havent played it before or to anyone that have only played it for a couple of hours. Heck, this game is FREE afterall and there are even special events on holidays and give aways. Only thing is that you gota find the special gift boxes during those events. Just dont listen to the negative reviews about this game and just keep on playing. Oh and if you want to be a freeinum player, just buy ONE thing in their marketplace and you get character limit to 4, chip limit to UNLIMITED, and other free stuff they give to you when you just buy one thing. I give my support to the company for making this great game ^^
5189	0	a	Unfortunately garbage. I've been given so many months of free play over the last few years that this game has been out and evertime I download it I play about an hour and get bored. There are many many better games to waste time on. The UI is clunky, the crafting is scattered as ♥♥♥♥, the combat is as clunky. It's just a bad waste of time. Massively dated as well. 4/10.
5190	0	a	This game was a technological ♥♥♥♥ sain on the gaming world. I played about 1 hour of game time and that was wasted. Lowest graphics and seemingly low populated server and still around 10FPS. And the ' Your computer sucks ' IS Crap. I have a computer that runs games like BF3 and NS2. Dont belive me check my library. The story seemed bland and the quality of play seemed the same.
5191	0	a	Poor graphics and game play control made me put this one down before I bothered to spend too much time with it.
5192	0	a	Horrid controls, and to slow of a pace.
5193	0	a	This game was a technological ♥♥♥♥ sain on the gaming world. I played about 1 hour of game time and that was wasted.

5194	0	a	This game is very hard for me [and i think also with you] this game has a bug problem (sorry to say) :(
7644	1	a	Awesome game! I love it. If you like to craft or gathering items, make your own medicines, weapons or armors, or just like you pvp or level then this is the game for you! Come and give it a chance! Giving something new a try won't hurt anybody!
5196	0	a	Trailer looks better than the game.
5197	0	a	Game was probably worth playing when it wasn't free.  This isn't STALKER or Fallout (not 3). The world is empty. The players are scattered too far apart. Crafting is okay. Making vehicle parts and selling them was my best experience in the game. Explore as much as you want, you'll see nothing but bland enemy mobs and clustered harvest nodes. I expected nuclear wastelands to have abandoned buildings waiting to be explored. All buildings were the same: no loot, only mobs in some. PVP is meh. PVE is meh.  A few years ago free players had three crafting queues. Now they reduced it to one.
5198	0	a	Played through the solo begining and was very happy with playability and was looking forward to exploring and finding new things, but once outside in the multi user world, the game became utterly unplayable on a platform on which I have played dozens of MMORPGs without framerate issues or lag issues to this extent where I had to stair the player at the ground just to slowly turn then try to look up to see if I was facing the correct direction after only a few minutes in the unplayable outer world I had to quit never to return.
5199	0	a	The game itself is pretty cool. Full of bugs though, constant connection issues, The player base is 100% rude..
5200	0	a	I would rather bathe in acid than play this again
5201	0	a	Below average Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game. (MMORPG)  Interface is clunky. Instead of mouse clicking on an enemy to attack, you have to change to fight mode using Middle Mouse Click or Y key then fight the enemy the hard way then turn Fight Mode off then picking up drops is ridiculously difficult compared to standard MMORPG's.  Missions are unclear and leveling up takes too long.  Game Deleted!
7646	1	a	Well, I'll start it off simply put. I played this game from the creation of my steam account (In late 2012) and I consistently played it from that period until around December 2013, for no specific reason.  Basic Positives: The game is very well designed, and has virtually unlimited customisability There has always been a community of players willing to play with me or it's free, so you can easily get your friends to join you if needs be If you don't want to level up too high, you can easily get what you need within a week, and be self sustained with crafting, which is literally used for everything from making basic weapons, to the best vehicles and armour, which might I add, is very detailed and advanced There is a smooth mixture of PvE and PvP areas, which make the big difference, with PvP areas in every area of the map, and plenty of gameplay features for anyone who likes either to play alone, or with a huge clan to enjoy  Basic Negatives: The community isn't the best it could possibly be, and I feel that it is that way because of the development and releases of more MMORPG based games in the last 2 years. With games such as Defiance, Planetside 2 and the ever standing World of Warcraft eating into the community, it's been progressively decreasing in the last year or 2. (There used to be a consistent upto 20000 people online) The game is very heavily based on a single £5 (or whatever in other currencies) to become an efficient crafter, and earn the option of crafting with a waiting list, to put it simply. Personally, I had no issues as I have 4 characters (The max) and each is heavily levelled into various aspects, but it's a shame that that's what the game has had to resort to.  Gameplay: The game was released in 2009 (Not on steam) and has been consistently updated and used by Devs and GM's (General Managers/Moderators) and I seem alot of steady improvement in items, early and late game dynamics and near areas/features. One thing i've enjoyed about the game is that it's never the easy way to play, and challenging the play to do whatever they want/need to do is a key feature in this game, with a very heavily player based community, and teamwork being very heavily needed and used in events and boss battles. The game itself is very good, and requires little to no processing power, with my old 2008 Toshiba laptop easily running the game (Which might I add, had an old AMD Processor/Integrated Graphics). As a whole, it requires little to no power to play and run effectively over the long term.  Community: Fallen Earths community is very unique, with literally all kinds of players involved, and have the capability of being involved, with RP easily implemented into the way you play the game, and more warrior type players can easily goto various areas/towns and just massacre anything and all they want, with areas like that in every Sector of the map. There is even a dedicated map for pure PvP for any and all players, but is usually for much more advanced and high level players.  Enemies/AI: The enemies and AI in Fallen Earth are very advanced for their age, and with enemies like Bosses all having their own unique dungeon like places, and areas with enemies relating to them, as well as an area in one of the later areas which has a prison which is guarded by enemies, and has varying levels and harder enemies as you move in, with around 5 bosses before you reach a 'grand master' type boss, and essentially have to have a big group. Enemies as a whole are very well balanced, and progress very well, with no real intermingling with levels or players in general getting into the thick of a battle with enemies 10 times higher level than they are is literally 0% (Unless they travelled for quite a while).  Conclusion: It always has been, and still is my most played game ever, and I would definitely say to any MMORPG fan, that they should definitely give it a go, and if they need help/advice I will gladly clear up any issues or problems with the game. 9/10 (Only due to community loss)
7648	1	a	It's a good game if you have a lot of patience.  The scenery reminds me of a cartoon where that mouse is running from the cat and the same tables and chairs keep scrolling across the screen. The hugh landscape (Its pretty damn big) does take the edge off because you can't have everything. That thing i mentioned about patience?  It's pretty much like any other mmo quest wise. Go here, kill this many of that, come back, here's something you could have used 6 levels ago now listen to this NPC make some sarcastic comment about chickens blah blah blah. There is, in fact, quite a good quest line giving you the main jist of what's going on, what/who you are and whats happened, which takes the edge off. Patience again.  Combat is alright... Bit clumpy and unreliable at times. You agro' a guy in a building, he runs around in circles for a couple seconds then just warps his ♥♥♥♥ though that wall. Those guys dont mess around with doors and shet.  Like most mmorpgs you have some different combat types (melee/pistols/rifles) and as always it's normally best to stick to one and do some research before you hit level 20 and realise you suck because you did it wrong. You can re-spec of course but that's gonna cost you.   Crafting is one of the games saving grace for me. It's hugh. You can pretty much make anything and everything you could ever need from guns, helmets and knives to horses (Yeah, you make them, like from stuff) motorbikes and farms. You don't NEED to buy anything from anyone if you plan ahead and scavange as you go. I'm not 100% but I think f2p is limited to 1 que. so you can only set one item to craft at any time. After buying something it opens to 3 slots. Which is still pretty limiting. Without being able to que crafting it could take like 20 hours to make an ATV, which is one of the lowest levels of transport other than a horse.... Patience once again.  This game is totally playable and enjoyable without paying a penny. If you can put up with having to do everything the hard, tedious and long ♥♥♥ way. The dev's.... owners? I don't know who but whoever calls the shots seem to care more about new, shiney and down right pointless stuff to buy rather than fixing issues that I remember existing when I first played the game. After writing this I don't actually know why I'd recommend this game but I still would. It ticks enough of my boxes (take that as you will) for me to see past the flogging of horrible make-you-pay tactics and see a really good, enjoyable and fun game.  After all it is a free game...
5203	0	a	If you like a cheap knockoff of fallout new vegas with crappy ai, Horrible admins, and people who use side chat to explain their life up untill now then sure get this game. I have to admit it was fun for like 30 mins, after that a repetitive piece of crap. The leveling system is totally flawed making it sometimes damn near impossible to complete a quest. Good premise of a game but horribly taken a turn for the worst.. Its rated mature so who cares what my name was it wasnt derogetory in anyway, and was changed by an admin without any notice. the game itself is 5 outta 10. But the admins make it more like a 3 outta 10 would reccommend changing the rating to an kids only. The landscape is bland with bits scattered about for you to scavenge if your the right level... All in all if your trying to burn time play it, but dont forget to hit that uninstall button before you leave... Its free for a reason... kinda blows
7650	1	a	A cold apocolypse MMORPG/MMOFPS/MMOTPS Story line is a bit weak and not much refered to it, but that doesn't matter. A lot of weaponry/armor/... Also RolePlay! Give it a shot ;) it's free anyway :)
7652	1	a	Its pretty goood See for your self.
7654	1	a	Really fun Post Apocalyptic MMO. Even a good implementation of F2P. Very much enjoyable for casual/normal play (F2P) and inexpensive to upgrade on a monthly bases when you have more time to play. From a crafters point of view and with the extra thought on Post Apocalyptic it is really fun. Going out scavening and then crafting. Another plus is that crafting can be a big part of your playstyle, but if you hate crafting you will not miss out if you ignore it totaly.
7656	1	a	Have to say I have no idea how i missed this game. While the initial learning curve is relatively steep and some controls initially feel clunky it progresses nicely to become second nature and not what you initially thought.   The community is simply fantastic, i have never seen such an active Help channel with old timers, GMs, mentors and new players all chipping in to assist with any questions. On that note I have also never encountered a game so well moderated, trollers/spammers etc will actively be muted and banned if it becomes excessive and the GMs do not hide, they actively PM responses to Help channel queries or respond direct to the channel.  The game itself is essentially Fallout 3 turned MMO mostly, 95% of in game items are craftable. You start only being allowed one character and one crafting queue slot plus a limit on chip (in game money) amount but a very small real money purchase on the store unlocks additional characters, crafting slots and removes the credit limit. You can earn store cash through surveys so no real money is even necessary. 5G1C is needed to buy a 'Return to home' device and that can be earned six times over from one survey.  So the gameplay, its a crafters dream and nightmare as you will spend a ton of time just trying to hoard resources :) Combat is targetted in that you actually need to swing for the head or arms or shoot for the location and if your cursor is off, well you miss. On that note you get six, YES SIX, weapon slots on your character which all show in the game. You can have a primary meleee two hander on your back, a primary ranged two hander on your back, two pistols on your hips and two one hander melee on your hips. Its choicetastic ;)  Seriously recommend that as its F2P you check it out and just give it a few hours after running the tutorial as you learn a ton through the inital and subsequent missions. Well worth checking out, so much so i subbed after only 20 hours of playtime.
7658	1	a	Really fun I recommend it that is all I have too say
7660	1	a	I like the Game alot and it is a great way to have fun the crafting is top notch and the ability to go threw the world and get items the only thing that bugs me is my lag but thats expected i would give this game 5/5 great game.
7662	1	a	It has good customization and ok combat!
7664	1	a	A very good FPS game. Graphics are decent, and the mechanics and skill paths are virtually endless.  My one problem with it, however, has to be the endless grinding involved.
5205	0	a	THIS IS STUPID!!!!!! I spent eight dollars on this stupid game back when it wasnt free and i dont get a refund!
7666	1	a	Good game for roleplaying which is all I am interested in
7668	1	a	Open World, I mean OPEN WORLD!!! It so so large. I have played 400 hours and I did not see every sector. Craft what You want, weapon, clothes, wehicles and even Your own house and farm. Many many many missions, monsters and items. I have not seen such a great game in all my life. You can choose your own way, style, startegy, friends and enemys. You`ve got to play it now!
7670	1	a	Really fun Post Apocalyptic MMO. Even a good implementation of F2P.

Another plus is that crafting can be a big part of your playstyle, but if you hate crafting you will not miss out if you ignore it totaly.
7672	1	a	I certainly like the idea of a fallout like theme where everything is destroyed and so what humans remain alive have created forts and live off what remains of the old world. It's customization is certainly a nice feature. The fact that you can get ' Mounts ' or vehicles is certainly a awesome touch but with the size of the actual map it's clear to see why they are in this.   Since it is free to play there is no harm in giving this ago. I've spent meant hours in game and I do enjoy it and would reccommend it to other's.
7674	1	a	I owned and played this game before I started using steam. I played alot and loved it dearly. It is to me, a wonderous falloutish mmorpg with a beautiful crafting system. That being said, its GM's are very problematic. I was friends or at least friendly with one named Tiggs and one day I got an e-mail from her saying my account was banned for breaking or exploiting a game rule. I e-mailed her back asking what she possibly thought I had done. No response. I pleaded with her, mind you I loved this game dearly, and its players, and it broke my heart that with as much as I played it, and contributed to other players I didnt even recieve the grace of knowing what I was accused of... So what I guess Im trying to say, is its sort of like an ex-girlfriend you cant stop thinking of or understaning how you lost, yet cant tell someone they wouldnt have a better experience.
7676	1	a	You can collect 'Suspicious Cheese' and 'Questionable Meat'. The epic journey of surviving in a post apocalyptic wasteland by crafting horses.
7678	1	a	This game is extremely addicting and fun, the first few hours are boring but once you get past that this game is AMAZING. Graphics are meh and the combat system is kinda bad, however the simple fact that I can go into a cave mine some coal kill giant ants and underdwellers to find a secret cavern is just awesome. And th MMO part adds so much immersion to the game, know whats more fun than attacking a bandit camp? Attacking it with a group of people. I normally stray away from games like this but I have been playing this bad boy nonstop. Also notice how most of the bad reviews complain about difficulty or buggyness or complicated gameplay yet they haven't played for more than 10 hours? They say some crap like this game is Pay2win, and its not at all, Sure paying gets you some 'new' things faster but you can get most of these things ingame anyway. If you are a realism fan then get this game. Note this game has a big learning curve and difficulty spike.  Now to the problems The enemy AI tends to be ♥♥♥♥♥, Enemy's respawn in 1 minute taking away from immersion, for some reason the damage and health system is bad (No joke dogs do 20 Dmg a bite and attack every seconds or so and I've gotton surrounded by em and killed in seconds as the ♥♥♥♥♥ take bullets to the head) Stay away from junkyward dogs and gurad dogs is my only tip, The scavenging system can be quite stupid sometimes as well.   Over all this game has +Great gameplay mechanics +Interesting storys and characters +Great immersion +Addictive micro managing +Great trade and communication system  The middle ground Game lacks mercy for new player which can drive people away but not a problem and is more made for intense gamers, not bad but not great graphics.  Now the bad  -Terrible AI -Unhelpful NPC's -Strange level system -Fast enemy respawns  Overall I'd give this game a 8.9/10 
7680	1	a	the closest to Fallout 3 univers i could find from a online game
7682	1	a	A post-apocalyptic shooter MMO, it has low-requirement graphics and is free-to-play. Fallen Earth has an elaborate crafting system on which the in-game economy depends on; since almost all equipment, usables, and mounts are player-created. It has an emphasis on PvP towards the mid-game and thereafter, in which players join factions and fight eachother. Combat is straightforward, and stale: point-click-shoot, and no bullet drop. There is an attempt at 'magic' in-game described as 'mutations', but from my experience it is mostly a useless addition.
7684	1	a	This game is amazing. I headed into it completely blind, and i was astounded as to the sheer enormity of it. Every session i play i find a new item or enemy. The game world is so big I havent been out of the first sector yet and im still surprised to the hugeness of it. Plus you get all of this for free.  I love the skill advancement, its non-linear and your are free to spec into anything you want. There are no classes to restrict you, telling you how to play the game. The only classes are the ones you make yourself.
7686	1	a	good game for poor ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥♥ shit dickball anal ♥♥♥♥♥♥
7688	1	a	for any fallout fans, you need/want this game.  for once, its not a pay-to-win MMO, where you can buy epicly tricked out gear on the item store. hell. the item store is kinda junk after you realize you can get everything in game, and get better than the item store by area 2 (and this is comming from someone who spent the money to find out).  the setting is post-nuclear apocolypse, so fallout fans will have a field day with it. hell... if the rumored fallout online is like this, then i'll have found the game i live on &gt;.&gt;.  the skill system is one of the best elements. you HAVE to craft stuff to get better at it. and i mean aLOT of stuff. you have to use your skills to get better at them as well. theres no book to buy, no item to find, that will do it for you.  while it DOES have some bad points (every game does. dont ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t yourself), they tend to be rather small. downtime (an MMO standard) tends to be frequent, but kept short... usually less than 5 hours. there ARE the odd glitches that allow critters to hit youy from across the map, or, to one shot you.... but then again, you may have just wandered too far into the wasteland for your own good/level. finally, pvp is just as open as the world. there ARE specific zones for it on some servers, but they warn you well enough when your heading into/near one.  gamers review? 9/10
7690	1	a	Love this game! if your a fallout fan then this game is for you, except with many more things to do and discover!
7692	1	a	The game has a very good crafting system, pvp is fun to, a over all good 'shooter' MMORPG, and it's even free to play!
7694	1	a	It's sort of a spiritual successor to Star Wars Galaxies, crafting is vitally important... but you don't necessarily have to do it yourself. There's no 'Weapon Shop' or 'Armor Shop', there's only the very rare rewards and drops or players who have crafted these things and put them into the economy. You will inevitably run out of ammo and your gear will fall apart. You need to participate in the economy somehow just to survive.  The actual gameplay is sort of FPS-styled but rather than moving away from the point-and-click WoW style MMO interface... it just adds this other layer where if you don't multitask you'll miss all your attacks while ducking into cover and popping mutations and bandaging yourself up. You still HAVE to go through the ordinary stuff, but the skill curve goes up a bit for being a good shot at the same time.  The skill layout is almost Anarchy Online in its open-ness and complexity........... until you realize that years of lazy balance and reactive patches have rendered half the stats and skill trees completely useless and cookie-cuttered a lot of things. It may jump back and forth from patch to patch.... but mostly going to limit you to a LOT less variety than advertised. Still, the things that DO work are generally pretty fun.   The first two sectors are easily the best MMO areas I've ever played, very detailed and lovingly crafted. FULL of content, you can wander off in any direction and stumble into something interesting... After S2.... not so much. Also not sure why they cut the starting towns down to three from... eight or ten or something. Streamlined or stupified, hurt the newbies most.  There is absolutely no pay-to-win in this game. You can pay for convenience or you can pay for custom appearances... but there's nothing that gives any real advantage past the Freemium level. Most of the marketplace items end up on the auction for anyone to buy with in-game money also, but pure free players are limited to how much of that they can carry.
7696	1	a	The game is fun also the community on there is great not alot ♥♥♥♥ people on there ask a person who is rich for money like 20 red they will do it xD its funny but hey there nice. But the bad thing is the owner left the game to die
7698	1	a	basically full of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and the usual MMO spastics, avoid it if you enjoy intelligent conversation or normal people
7700	1	a	this is like a fallout with an mmo aspect. though to be honest there is a bit of leveling needed to go out there and explore. the crafting system wont seem as bad at first(as there are wait times for crafting items),but when you get to atvs and cars, pop a squat and go play fallout on a console for about 6 hours to see if a peice of your car is finished, or just go to bed, either one.  if they console ported this game, i would play it.   #still better than dayz
7702	1	a	Imo, this is the best MMORPG ive ever played.
7704	1	a	Do not play this game if : 1.You do not want to invest a lot of time 2.You do not want a crafters-dependent economy. 3.You can not stand exploring for many hours. 4.You are addicted to FPS. 5.''OMFG!! FALLOUT RIPOFF''  You will either like it or hate it.This game is not for the many.In any case give it a try..it is free. After 150 hours I am still playing..and haven't even scratched its surface. 
7706	1	a	It has good customization and ok combat!
7708	1	a	basically full of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and the usual MMO spastics, avoid it if you enjoy intelligent conversation or normal people

7710	1	a	Very good game, good gameplay , good graphics. I recommend it.
7712	1	a	I haven't liked most of Steam's F2P games, but I was pleasently surprised with this one, I enjoyed it much more than I thought I would. I love how the game wants you to make your own stuff instead of looting or buying items. You need to scavenge for scrap materials and use other scrap to put together weapons, like a painball gun that fires metal balls. It's a really cool idea. There's still bugs that need ironing out from the Steam release but the game is worth a try, even if it doesn't look that great. It's free, so it's not like you've lost anything.
7714	1	a	the closest to Fallout 3 univers i could find from a online game
7716	1	a	I love this game :D
7718	1	a	If you don't have it, get it. 
7720	1	a	One of the best F2P MMOs i've ever played, i reccomend it. Pros: +Fun to play with friends. +Better PvP because you need to actually aim. +Not P2W Cons: -Not frequently updated -Bugs/ Animations not Completed. 
7722	1	a	Great for crafting
7724	1	a	I love this game :D
7726	1	a	the closest to Fallout 3 univers i could find from a online game
7728	1	a	This is the MMO that I keep coming back to. If you want crafting, questing and sandbox, some would say one cannot go with the other, but it works here. There is also farming, pvp, only in certain spots, but those spots are rich with resources, so there is no griefing the noobs. Also the community is pretty good and the Help channel actually helps. To top it off players moderate the chat and I have seen the ban hammer come down more than once. Yes the interface is clunky, yes the graphics are not AAA, but I love this game and it gives me a sense of accomplishment when I can go out, gather stuff and make myself a shirt. Although its F2P i have played with and without subs and I have not really seen a differance. But for $10 a month you cant go wrong.

5210	0	a	What is this garbage? I am honestly surprised that they don't pay you to download the game. Problem number 1, the game never started. Problem number 2, i had to sit there and accept the same 2 agreements about 5 times each. Problem number 3, it takes about an hour to an hour and a half for the game to get ready to launch. Overall, it was a huge waste of my time. Do yourself a favor, and don't download this game.
5211	0	a	worst game ever , with the worst gamplay first. 1. low and shity graphics  2.bullcrap story 3.pay 2 win 4.dont waste your time on this peace on crap
7734	1	a	This game is great! The enemy told me everything I needed to know after forcing him to play this game!
5212	0	a	a discount fallout new vegas [and all the other one's] a wal-mart version, found in a dumpster,or a toilet. or, to simplyfy it, it's equivilent to red faction 2.
7736	1	a	I entered the game and asked where the pros.titutes were, someone soon whispered me telling me to 'go play a more kiddie game like Runescape'.  10/10
7738	1	a	Open World, I mean OPEN WORLD!!! It so so large. I have played 400 hours and I did not see every sector. Craft what You want, weapon, clothes, wehicles and even Your own house and farm. Many many many missions, monsters and items. I have not seen such a great game in all my life. You can choose your own way, style, startegy, friends and enemys. You`ve got to play it now!
7740	1	a	Fallen Earth is an RPG which offers a wide range of activities. According to me this is one of the best RPG offered in the world of videogames. It's not pay to win and it can also be considered a mix of Fallout and MadMax. Why?. Because it offers a wide map, such as Gran Canyon and veichles are available. You can drive a wide range of veichles such as ATV, motorbikes, choppers, Dune Buggy, sport totally customizable (there are even animals to mount)!. For people who think that it could be pay to win, i am able to tell you that it's not pay to win, you do not have to pay anything to be stronger than other players! There is people who tell that Fallen Earth is dead. This is not true. The number of players is increasing but at the same time some players stop to play because it's a a bit hard as RPG, but do not worry about it, you'll can join a clan which will help you to learn how to play and how to be stronger! Furthermore this game is also playable by players who have a low end PC, so don't worry about FPS.
7742	1	a	Fallen Earth, at its time of release, was actually a pretty fun romp. The world and landscape was vast and full of nice locations, as well as keeping an excellent post apocalyptic tone to everything. There was a lot to do, many places to explore, mutants and enemy factions to hunt down and kill, and hundreds of items to craft. In fact over 90% of all in game items where craft-able at the time. It was a ambitious game that didn't quite hit the mark on a lot of things.   While it was a pretty game and offered a lot of options as far as what you could do and where you could go, the big headaches of the game ended up dragging it down. For starters it used a skill system that was pretty open ended. Normally i would say 'Ah hell yeah, i can really be what i want to be!' Unfortunately that is not the case. It was pretty easy to bork a character and you really had to specialize if you wanted to be remotely effective in anything. The skills you could learn and acquire throughout the game where nothing amazing, there just wasn't any wow factor. It also implemented a quasi magic system, which acted more like a enhancement to a weapon style vs a more caster role. A pure caster is possible, but in game it just wasn't all that effective.  Combat itself was about as boring as it could get. Weapons where just a bore to use. The game offered multiple firearm classes to specialize in as well as melee. The animations and sounds where nothing short of drab. Weapons felt like peashooters, even if it was a higher tier rifle or machine gun, all guns just 'felt' like you where shooting a BB gun. Melee was even worse, as the animations and damage indication was sloppy. On top of that, mobs sit around, waiting to be engaged. I'm a little over early MMO troupes, how about you?  However, even though i may be a little harsh on its short coming, with a group of friends, this game can be a blast. There are a ton of areas to explore, side missions to cash in on and a mid/late game faction based pvp zone. This is where it can really get interesting. All players have the option of joining a faction, and each faction has some special skills and perks associated with them. Fighting over control towns and resource fields are really fun with the right gang of people.  Fallen Earth will not be for everyone. If you can get past the poor combat system and dated MMO style of quests and combat, it is a pretty big game to explore and get sucked into. Its even F2P, so if you like Post Apoc settings and are up for something different and new, give it a shot. It might surprise the hell out of you.
7744	1	a	It's F2P but I sure don't see a reason to pay montly, you get practically nothing from doing it. Anyway, It's fun for a free game, you can't be picky in that regard, so I enjoy it. The only downside I've seen, is I haven't really found all that unique loots. It seems you craft most of your stuff and that you usually just get componets from killing stuff. To that regard, there are more than one way to get mats, 1 is just on bodies and then 2 is on various plants and things around the world, also you can your skill up and at certain points skin and harvest harder plants/animals/whatever. So it's not just run around and kill ♥♥♥♥, there are skills and an active improvement based skill set that increases when you do more of stuff close to your skill, increasing it. It's worth a try, the quests seem plentiful and if you have a friend you may be able to pull some harder quests and creatures earlier on. I started at what seems to be the crafting hub, it seemed the most friendly--farmstead.
7746	1	a	I must say that even with the bugs I still find this game quite enjoyable....its no SWG though...*sigh*
7748	1	a	Wonderfully done, Amazing story line, great customization throughout the game.
7750	1	a	I recommend playing this game if you like to kill things 
7752	1	a	Great game worth buying.
7754	1	a	This game looks asowme!!! I better download it!
5216	0	a	Couldn't even get into the game due to a very broken sign in system.
5217	0	a	for one this is a 'fallout rpg' fallout is already a rpg fallout 1,2 login does not work type user correctly NO CAPS LOCK (oh wait caps lock lol) and pass is the same way just go buy fall out 3 OOOOOH no money ....... get a job 5/10
7756	1	a	this is a very fun game remindes me of fallout and is sweet for a free to play
7758	1	a	The only post apocalyptic MMO that I know of, Fallen Earth is unique in the gaming landscape. The game is something like Gamma World meets Mad Max, but also with a Western theme. The game has an indie budget and look but has some enjoyable game play. This is the only game that I know of in which your character can ride a giant mutant chicken as a mount. With more resources, Fallen Earth could gain a larger player base and compete against more prominent MMOs.
7760	1	a	This game is awesome. It is a great play if you're willing to put some hours into it.
7762	1	a	Very entertaining, good amount of quests, easy to log in, play and log out for quick runs.
7764	1	a	fun game yes play long time yes, not many people, still much funnerer
7766	1	a	good game look like Fallout New Vegas and Fallout 3 but More fun....... The difference between fallout and fallen earth..... her you can play withe other player do your mission and you can rid a car are a horse for your mission Instead of walking in fallout to your mission   how love fallout i recommended to play this game it will be a good challenge    
7768	1	a	Post-Apocalyptic MMO . . can't get any better then this. A bit slow to level but good world size.
7770	1	a	Its a ok game with ok detail and some decent weapons 
7772	1	a	20 out of 10 stars if I could.   For a freemium game this has to be one of the BEST mmorpg games I have played since WoW Vanilla. The ellaborate gameplay mechanics and detailed crafting and customisation is a Joy!!  I like games that make me think, not ones that have been over simplied to accomodate for people under the age of Seven. I am sure there are bugs, like with any game, but they can be hotfixed.    As far as 'I am' concerned, please Developers do not simplify this game, it is a work of art.   Keep up the Fantastic work!!
5221	0	a	looks amazing first 5 minutes then u say ♥♥♥♥ it.
5222	0	a	I need some assistance because Fallen Earth changed my acount username and password to a strange code that I have no clue what could mean and or be.

7774	1	a	Just go play Fallout, Not this nock off.
5224	0	a	anybody can help me? I create an account I put password and email and login check the email and run the game but the game waant the name and put any name I want (if I create account I cant put any name It was not on the box) and dont work I cant play this game I must have any name from creating account anybody please tell me thx :) 
7776	1	a	Best Apocalypse Sandbox MMO out there ... oh and it's Free 2 Play !
7778	1	a	Ive played this game for about 32 hourse this week alone...lol...Its awesome, It might as well be Fallout online.
5225	0	a	Endless updates. They need to sync their server updates with Steam so its auto updated in the background instead of waiting until I want to play to do an insane amount of updates. Uninstalling.
7780	1	a	Wasteland themed MMORPG with superb crafting system, HUUUUUUGE world and lots of content to crawl through. Crafting requires some effort but also allows players to create around 95% of the items in game. My only gripe is the easy(ish) mobs and quests. Or maybe I am just too Pro, who knows?   Played it back in alpha, beta and bit after release. Now that it's free2play, it's only gotten better. More streamlined!  Go, get lost in radiated wastelands and grow your own mutated 3rd arm!
7782	1	a	Basically Fallout meet Guild Wars, you cant go wrong.
7784	1	a	*It's not just a game, it's survival'. Indeed, it's hard to survive playing this game it's so bad.
7786	1	a	Fallen Earth is a F2P &amp; MMO version of Fallout 3 If you like Fallout 3 then you will love this. That is all i have to say  8/10 
7788	1	a	One of the greatest FPS MMO's out there, this is without a doubt something that can surpass the Next Gen cap. 1. Very smooth Gameplay. 2. Low System Requirments. 3. Great Ai and gun play.
7790	1	a	This Game took me nearly 2 days to download but it was worth it as soon as I played it It was awesome it may need some fixing but it's awesome and hey it's free it an apocalyptic game i have been searching 2 Thumbs Up for me
7792	1	a	Quite a fun and addicting game for free! It gives you that gaming feeling
7794	1	a	Fallen Earth is a rpg/multiplayer game which is like the game fallout.for people who cannot play fallout or cannot buy it this is the game you would want to play
7796	1	a	Fun and chlanging. You can customize your charater. You can get diffrent mounts. The free to play kinda sucks it's very limited. but if you decide to play it f2p then you will still have fun things will just be a bit slower for you. But I would suggest this game to many others.
7798	1	a	Pretty good game with very rich and rewarding crafting system. The world is VERY big (I don't know if it really is 1000 square kilometers, but if the other sectors are as big as the first one that's possible) and it rewards players for wandering in the wasteland by the form of resources laying around. The music is moody and a bit of melancholic. The gunplay is fairly good and requires a bit of skill. Although many zones are empty and there aren't many players, the game still feels good. But the game is harsh for new players and it doesn't really explain anything in the beginning. The world definitely sucks you in and the crafting system is so rich and interesting with lots of customization options and a lot of gear to made... The game is good overall and I like it. And it's relaxing to just wander in the vast emptiness of the desert on your own, just you and your horse (the atmosphere, if anything, is pretty solid and gives the player the feel of a dying world)...
7800	1	a	The game is basically Fallout 3 Multiplayer. The area of the game is just HUGE and there are probably THOUSANDS of various different kinds of quests just for you!
7802	1	a	if you love the Fallout games then your gonna love this game :)
7804	1	a	This is a pretty good game. It's large, it's graphics look like Fallout 3's. I like it. However there are certain things that could be fixed. You'll see for yourself when you play. Still worth installing.
7806	1	a	Update simulator right here! 11/10
5231	0	a	it was pretty meowk but i not like contromeowz thumbz down
5232	0	a	This game used to be good. Now, it has a crap ton of bugs. 
7808	1	a	This game is fun very similar with Fallout , I like game have crafting system , survival , hunt :&gt; . If you say this game is hard to control , ya it is .But this won't hard if you play over 20hrs in this game . When you reach level &gt; 18 you will feel empty , no quest to do ~~' . But keep in mind that just a beginner map , try ride a motorbike go to the north , that place is insance place and have more thing to do , a lots PVP zone :I . That moment you can get a headshot from far distance O.o . You can find a lots wreid creature and BIG BOSS ( you can get a good weapon from it , but the risk is bigger :&gt; than you thought it's not .)   By the way , this game is very fun and it have help channel , you can join that channel then asking someone help you , they will willing to help you , if they really near you . So don't say this game is lame , this game is too hard ,blablabla .... Ye it is :&gt; !. But who care , just play and see what you see in front of your eyes then review your actually feel .   -&gt;From a person didn't play this game for a long timeeeeee ....   -/10
7810	1	a	A wonderful cross between Fallout and MMO's...I love it.
7812	1	a	Its a bit dated and the community is nice. The game UI takes some getting used to but it really does feel like Fallout NV Online. And its pretty enjoyable. I suggest playing it.

7820	1	a	Great game to chill and have fun with your friends.
5240	0	a	TL;DR :   Fallen Earth was a dream, years ago. It was actually one of the best communities I've seen, and had a lot of promise for the future. When it was released, there wasn't a single popular MMORPG that was not drowning in magic and pretty colors with hotkeys.  Then the genre of not-magic based MMO's that don't use hotkey and are first person took off, and they all superceeded Fallen Earth nearly immediately. The title was sold after a few months and visible LARGE decrease in playerbase, and immediately turned into a F2P model. Not saying it's 100% business 0% gaming, but it feels like it.

5243	0	a	You know one of those games you were so pumped about, looking like a total lot of fun, then you got it, and it was completly NOT what it said it was, and all of the fan base are just addicts of this type of Pay2Win type games and found this new and exciting. This is it. This is it the goldmine of that.2/10 for trying.
7822	1	a	They tried.
5244	0	a	Gritty and plain, this free to play game has an interesting theme for a MMO. Set in the future, after a nuclear and biological war, the human race is completely decimated, leaving only hostile and dying settlements in the Grand Canyon.   FPS or third person, this game involves guns and melee on a PvP/PvE lvl with decent customization.   The story is very interesting, keeping you playing, but the PvP and endgame PvE is lacking and very unbalanced and the presence of pay to win does not help its cause.   Giving you large amounts of playtime and story, this is a good game if you have time on your hands and are seeking a free, simple and story driven MMO that plays more like an RPG.   If you enjoyed the Fallout series and want a game that can't beat it, but really tried hard, this is your game.  Personal Rating: 2/5
7824	1	a	It's a pretty ok game for being free , has a pretty nice crafting system but leveling up can be a pain if you are alone. That and the game is almost dead , there are very little players around.I sincerely wish the devs would do something to draw players in and make this game alive again, this game also has one of the biggest worlds i have ever seen, it took me 2 hours to get across the one zone on horse and thats not even counting the amount of times i had to stop to feed my horse.
5246	0	a	crashed my pc when it first booted up ,, not good
5247	0	a	The Download window told me I had to wait '4 Days, 9 Hours' Before I could even see what this game is about. Do. Not. Download. This. Game.
5248	0	a	these kinds of games should not list themselves as free 2 play, because of the amount of restrictions they put on the free to play accounts either forcing them to quit, deal with it or upgrade to a subscription.
7826	1	a	complex , yet fun ,addictive, meet new people and team up or go solo ..help in chat from game tender or peoplse near buy is a mix of fallout and skyrim with the ability to craft guns , unique weapons and vehicles for use in game not gonna finish this one far a little while pack a lunch lol :)
7828	1	a	10/10
5251	0	a	Took me 30 min to make an account because i had to verify my account and then submit an application to play the game because i was a minor over 13 years old, i mean what the ♥♥♥♥! Do Not Get This Game.
7830	1	a	It's no Fallout, but it's a damn good game if you can understand how it works.
7832	1	a	good game but kinda disappointed for freemium   overall good
5255	0	a	Honestly, if you're looking for a MMORPG game, you MIGHT like this game if you are already used to the controls. But they seem kind of weird to me and quite annoying, and it causes me to need to change them all which I dislike. In the end the game seemed alright from the tutorial, but I gave up pretty quickly. You can check the game out if you want but I didn't like it therefore I don't recommend the game to those of you that are like me.
7834	1	a	In my first few hours of playing this some guy who looked like blade threatened to have my accoount closed then 30 minutes later tried to kill me. So yes i reccommend this game it's a fun and insane experience and i will probably play more of this.
5258	0	a	i think this is some sketchy ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ you
5259	0	a	If you were like me and were really itching to play Fallout but didn't have enough money at the time of dowloading it. Don't be decieved, this game is nothing like Fallout.   The first 3 hours of this were spent simply installing crap onto my computer for the game and I really wish I could go back in time and undo all of that because I'm never going to play this thing again. After that I had to create an account on the company's website just to be able to play.   The whole game also feels like its going 'It's not Fallout, its my own original game Fallen Earth!' For Christ's sake, you even start in an underground lab like area.  Not recommended. Go play Fallout or even RAGE.
5260	0	a	Describe what i liked or disliked about this game Steam asks me...  Well, i never got to play it, with my slow ♥♥♥ 40mbit connection it would take me up to 3 days to update this piece of s-word game.... Read about people having problems updating it through steam, decided to download it from gamersfirst website....it installed gamersfirst live, which i didn't ask for, then got into the exact same messed up update crap...  Really guys, if you want to make a game, make sure people can actually start it...  Total piece of ♥♥♥♥e if you ask me...will not try this again...ever..
5261	0	a	it SUCKS it took my like 3 hoursto play and it isnt even good
5262	0	a	I want to play this game but it said i need to make an acount and i downloaded all the stuff ,ran it, and it wouldn't work i ran game like fifteen times and it said creat a acount again and agian and the some thing over and over.
5263	0	a	If you usually rebind game controls in order to play things... have fun with this.
5264	0	a	Fallen Earth is the story of a really awesome idea getting destroyed by poor presentation, horrible gameplay, and just making a great example an how not to make a MMORPG. The story is sort of simple, you are a clone and stuff happened and then other stuff happened and now you are in the open (after a 20 min tutorial). I'm being for real I didn't know what was going on the entire time. The dialouge is horrendous which becomes a problem since thats how you get both important information and quests. Even though it's free it's not worth your time.

5267	0	a	I don't write reviews...at all but the hell this game gave me for the first 20 minutes was pure HELL. First, i spawn in the clone room as usual and proceed with the tutorial. The problems started when i attempted to complete the first kill task, I start the fight to only notice there's no sound. No ax swings, swooshes, GAAAHHH, nothing. So after this, I shrug it off as a small glitch that's in every f2p. I get to the point where you aquire the sniper where thereis again no sound; this annoys me so i decide to exit and search online for a fix (It was simple) so i relaunch it ( did i fail to mention each launch took about 4-5 minutes?) and rejoin where my progress last took place (one pro i found). There was sound, scratchy but there. I start the 'kill the sniper' objective only to find I once again have no sound. Oh but it dosent end there; I have a 40 degree pov, couldn't move (almost like i was stuck in the floor or wall) and couldn't see the snipers. I couldn't advance any further so I said ♥♥♥♥ this (20 minutes or so later) and decided to write a review.
7836	1	a	Not bad I guess.
7838	1	a	This game it cool and if you like post-apocalyptic game this is for you i playd it and i like it  have a nice day playing :3
7840	1	a	It's got a lot of problems, such as dated graphics, a fairly large learning curve, blocky animations, bugs, glitches, and a weak story. I've only got a few hours in it, and I had considered quitting it already. It was pretty tough to decide whether to recommend or not, given all of its problems, coupled with the fact that I still can't decide if I really like it. I'll also say it is very MMORPG-like. By that I mean, it's pretty much bland and generic in its gameplay, unless you like that type of game.   All that said, what it does have is a magnificent atmosphere. It's basically a hybrid between fallout 2, fallout New Vegas and a very mild, husk-like reminder of borderlands. I think the atmosphere and appocalyptic world is the only thing that will keep me playing this game for any longer, tbh.   I was very impressed with the combat and overall gameplay as I played the tutorial in the beginning, but it got stale pretty quick. I think it could be fun as a social experience, and/or with friends, but if you're going solo like I will be, you're probably not gonna have a good time.  At the end, I would say try it out for a little while to see if you like it, because its free, and if you like it, then great, theres a new player in the game and you get enjoyment, and if you dont like it, then you haven't lost any money. WARNING: This game does take a pretty long time to download the update at the beginning, so just beware.
7842	1	a	i love it it so intertaining. u survive the big incident and walk around getting new weapons and clothes. u lean how to make things and use abilities that can come in handy it so worth the time to play great job designers a thumbs up to u!!!
7844	1	a	10/10 Love this game
7846	1	a	It's basically a mixture of Fallout 3, and SYNC
7848	1	a	Okay I have yet to say how this game falls under anything bad. Very good Post apoltalytic game. Visuals are nice, it can run on lower tier computers. Usally ones that have 4 ram or higher. The game still has nice quests here and there and youll always have something to do. Going into a subscribed account is optional. Unlike pay to win games.
7850	1	a	Not bad I guess.
7852	1	a	It's addicting to play, I like the whole idea of building things to use in the game. I'm going to list the Cons first:  Cons: -Graphics are pretty basic, but the game it free -There are about a billion quests and you can only have so many on the active page so you can spend a lot of time wandering around doing quests and not realize you had two others you could have done while you were there. Now you have to go back where you just were to do those. -If you follow along the recommended quest lines, and skip the others in order to level up, you will be in over your head quickly. Not to mention some of the quest lines are 25 minute rides on a horse between them. -This can be a good thing or a bad thing, stands out bad to me, but respawns of enemies/creatures is WAY too fast. I understand that if there are a lot of people playing the same area with the same quests, you need to have respawns set faster in order for people not waiting so much, but this game has been out for a while and it's very rare to be questing near anyone else. If you are involved in clearing an area out and meet the boss, you retreat a little to reload/heal whatever and you will run into all the people you just killed and die in a horde. They really need to make some of the bigger quest jobs into their own instance without enemy/creature respawn. The game uses instances for some quests, they just need to do it more often, like the PRISON!!  Pros: -I find people are very helpful in help chat. I have seen the same question come up in less than 10 minutes from three different people and someone is willing to answer it all three times without being a smartass. -Lots of higher level players give things out to lower levels players which helps a lot in the leveling process. I got 50R from someone early in the game and can buy anything I want now at my level and I have a ton left over. Thanks dude! -It's fun gameplay,   As a final note, you can do surveys on the Fallen Earth website (not really, they redirect you to a company that handles it). These surveys can drive you insane. You can choose to do a 15 minute survey for a certain amount of points and then do 10 minutes of a 'pre' survey to determine that you are not a match for the 'real' survey and receive nothing. That needs to be fixed. I think when I initially started doing surveys for points, I spent two hours doing them, selected about 15 different surveys and only received credit for doing two. Not worth my time. You should at least get something for doing the 'pre' surveys even if you arent a match for the real one.  Anyways, fun game, kinda basic, surveys can be PITA.
7854	1	a	This game is quite wonderful if you didn't play fallout new vegas before it, many people who don't like Fallen Earth claim thats their reasoning, and I can agree, when I first played Fallout: New Vegas, I drew many comparrisons towards Fallen Earth, and its entirely based on their core gameplay styles, rather than mechanics. But this game is more balanced towards PvE, unlike fallout, you actually have true crafting and scavenging that doesn't just give you what your looking for, you have to make it, or learn it, unless you have friends in high places, such is the true life of a survivor in an apocolypse. This game also offers a nice explaination for one of gamings biggest mysteries, respawning. You have a collar, which transfers your DNA into a chamber, reconstructs you atom by atom, and gives you a 'new life' as a clone of yourself, something I wish was in other games rather than 'you died, restart' the game is vastley large, I could easily see Skyrim's map fitting within all the sectors, possibly more than once, and weapons are vast in the beginning, as you get stronger, weapons tend to become more scarce, with good reason, so you rely much more on your skills than an overpowered Bumper Sword, and with the character menus, such as Abilities and Stats, your options are endless in what type of character, or 'toon' you'd like to create, vs. Bethesda's way of 'upgrade it all over time' your more limited, but in a good way, and you have the ability to reset all your stats and start over to specifically fit how you play, along with the adition of mounts, which start off bad, give you 7 types of vehicles to choose from, Horse, ATV, Motorcycle, Dune Buggy, Chopper, Station wagon, and Sports car, they also have different types of each, an example would be 'dune buggy' vs. 'cargo buggy' or 'chopper' vs. 'Tribal Chopper' they have different stats, and each vehicle handles certain terrain better than others, as well as the ability to have more than one vehicle. The crafting is intuitive and very thourough, with real time crafting that takes time to make more complex items so you can't just spit out the best of something like a machinegun with the right tradeskill componants, it gives you a greater sense of acomplishment by knowing you built something that took hours rather than buying it from the Auction House, though as I said before, with friends in high places, anything is possible, I suggest craft early on as much as you can, ask the Help Channel for any information, for myself and others often know detailed answers on how to complete a task or quest, or locate specific items. The Wiki can be useful too, utilizing tools given to the player and figuring out your best way to play is the greatest part of the journey, to see all the pieces fall together:... IN SHORT: This game is for DEDICATED PLAYERS, those who will take the time to do these things listed, and many more unlisted tasks, some amazing, some time crunching, to acomplish your higher, longterm goals. I recommend this game to those looking for something to pour their hours into and want something that keeps giving them different challanges to overcome, AS FOR THE CASUAL PLAYER, I suggest giving it a try and seeing how you enjoy it, but not taking it to heart that it will be like fallout or anything that simple, its a rough game, for rough players, and if you don't like it, you can simply move on to another game, though I must warn you, I've found few MMORPGs as interesting as this one, only POTCO could hold my attention longer than this, and that may have been because of its simplisity and fun nature towards its gamers. With that being said... Enjoy the Apocolypse.
7856	1	a	My review was deleted awhike ago  Over all its an amazing game, takes time to get used to, I find it fun to play with people. Add me, shoot me a message if you'd like to play. :)
7858	1	a	Its alright but could be improved in many ways.
7860	1	a	Where's the download button for this game i can't find it anywhere or can't we not download it anymore. 
7862	1	a	Its a game! 10/10
7864	1	a	Walking simulator!!!    I rate -1/10 !! 
7866	1	a	Pretty Amazing Game. If only more people played it.
5275	0	a	This MMO just doesn't work that great. The AI is derpy, the controls are kind of weird, and I came in kind of expecting something like Rust or something but it's an MMO with questing and stuff that just makes the game fall apart at the seams. This sort of game really doesn't work well with the standard MMO formula.
5276	0	a	It's good buy mostly boring.A bit of graphics improvement would be nice and sometimes I had problems in the laucher and had to log in-game sometimes ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off.Happened to all 3 computers I had. I'm lvl 36 got born of the game,missions were bland,vehicles meh didn't like em wished they sound realistic.  Combat: Should fix have an aiming system for the combat. This feels fresh at first as it hasn't been done an awful lot in MMORPGs to my knowledge, but the aiming isnt executed very well and doesn't go well together in combination with the rest of the combat. It feels out of place that you cant really dodge attacks in a system like this where moving and fighting can be done. Your enemies attacks can't miss you, but your attacks can miss them easily. The game's world is big, but empty. It has no interesting places to show off and the graphics aren't very pleasing either. I understand that this is supposed to be a post-apocalyptic setting but that doesn't mean everything in existance should not be very pleasing to the eye. The environments are already bland, empty and occasionally filled with resources and enemy mobs.
5277	0	a	tryed to load the game, dident work, deleted it, recently desided to give it another try, but only the review option was avalible.
7868	1	a	Hello, I am your average Fallen Earth player, with your average Fallen Earth player hours.
5286	0	a	I can't even login after making an account with their service or with my steam account please fix this :/ 
5287	0	a	the more i play the less i like it....im not going into detail so here are just a few problems i have. pve they never miss so if you get attcked youre in for the fight if you run hey will kill you. melee attacks can hit you from 10 feet away. i get sniped out by people to far away to even see.
5288	0	a	Before I start my review, I would just like to point out that this is not from recent experience. I played this game about a year ago, and I hated it. First of all, I had to ask people how to enter FP perspective. Not that I think that it's the game's fault though. Anyways, the graphics are about as good as with a mixture of great models and horrible textures. Also, the reason I'm not reviewing it for the recent version is because when I started it up, all of the textures were missing, after downloading the 3+ GB game.   tl;dr: 1/10 would not apocalypse again.
5289	0	a	Its like Dayz and fallout but ♥♥♥♥ing worse its graphics look like a fat guy puked its story makes no sences and u will not even understand what to do in this stupid piece of crap for a game and i recommed not to try this usless game!
5290	0	a	Ugly, buggy, boring, repetetive. 1/10
5291	0	a	the game looks horrible graphics wise, i didn't stick around to find out what the story is about.
5292	0	a	this game sux ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ dont even try.
7870	1	a	ok if you can tolerate a few crashes and almost no tech support than you may get something out of this sadly nelected gem. I luv this fallout mmo replacement because we will never see fallout online. The vast open world will have you playing for hours. I wish this game was better taken care of but still its playable.
5294	0	a	dobt know how to login
5295	0	a	Alright lets talk about pros and cons to be fair. Pros:  -Free 9999999999/10 -No need a good gaming rig to play this game 30/10 -Good character customization 9000/10 Cons: -IDK is me or what this game looks kinda boring,(go youtube watch the gameplay before downloading it) btw ♥♥♥ u sara for making me to download first. -1/10 -The so call first mission kinda sucks to me, idk why this game required a freaking quest or mission for it. -9000/10 -I suck at this game cause i dont read instrustions. 1/10 -IDK what to say anymore, to me don't really worth my memory to download this. -Worst of the worst, this is the game that took the longest time for me to quit, like WTF! which ♥♥♥♥♥♥ games made you even to take more than 10 sec to quit.  In conclusion, this game seems fun to play but when first hand played, if kinda spoil my mood as it was not as good as i expected. In the end i wanna say, screw u sara for making me download this game first. And Zi Xiang u are a big time ♥♥♥♥♥♥, juz saying though u did nothing D:   
7872	1	a	Great Game, love it.
7874	1	a	:)
7876	1	a	for its age its a fun game to play but exspect to rage quiet a few good times hacks are a pain aim bots lag hacks wall haking and more but there really is alot of safe zone stuff to due join a faction and get in a good group of ppl and the dumb stuff is no big deal sadly dont exspect the gm to fix much to little to late and there jst milking the game for and income it will produce i stop playing for a while but i hear there some new content i will take a look lol play it t free thumps up from me beware the money store its the devil
7878	1	a	You don't see many games like this anymore. It's sort of like a Fallout game went MMO and had some anarchy online spilled all over it. While this game is far past its prime for 'New Content' the folks running the game are active, social, and quick to mute you for being an idiot in Help Chat. Currently it's being supported by an in game marketplace were you can buy mostly just social stuff, and an optional sub for enhanced perks like most of those free to play games out there. And while questing and developing your character and gear is the best part of the game, the end-game is a bit lack luster with very limited options on what to do outside PvP. The only issue I have with the game isn't even the game itself its the PvP community, most are pretty vile and quick to spit at you a mess of stuff you'd expect to hear from a 12 year old playing call of duty.
5299	0	a	I can't play that ♥♥♥♥ jessus!
7880	1	a	When fallout meets cheese. Never played this game but its a 71 meta. So try it! FREE? Nope to lazy.
7882	1	a	This is a great MMO to play with friends, I've probably spent 70 hours just playing with friends alone.   Be warned, this games graphics ARE dated. This game is pretty much a 'Fallout online' type game.   The staff and GMs of the game can be very toxic and rude, the global chat can be very bad, especially when you don't have staff on, which is almost always the fact.  The game revolves around grinding, if you don't want to spend a night crafting, harvesting and killing, DON'T PLAY THIS! You won't like it and you'll end up quitting and leaving a bad review.  The playerbase is something else, you have random people just yelling at eachother in global, being very toxic to new players that have just started.  The clans or groups in this game are very mixed, you can find good groups of people, you can also find groups of very bad people.  Conclusion,  This game is not made for people who casually want to play, this game takes dedication and consistancy inorder to play. I spent over 80 hours and I'm not even remotely close to where I wanted to be.   As a F2P MMO, this game was also designed around the webstore. Ofcourse, if you wish you can get exp boosters, and premium 'tiers' to gain exps faster and have access to more items.  I would not recommend this to someone who likes to click and point, this game will drain your life faster than your fleshlight. I would also not recommend playing this alone, this game is plenty better in numbers. It gets really lonely when you are in the middle of nowhere killing animals on that terrible exp grind.  Give this game a try, you might like it.
7884	1	a	i highly recommend this game, heavy crafting system, huge ♥♥♥ map, there a good choice of cars and bikes and other type of mount, custom ability or your toon from hair to clothing even to hide your ugly ♥♥♥ armor, also very good rp potential  there no player housing but there farming, harvesting mats, pvp zone, bloodsport and other goodies, the game is worth the time to play and invest
7886	1	a	This is one of the best games i ever played (in my opinion). its open world which i like and in some apocapalypse games u cant craft so thats why i like this game
5303	0	a	It reminds me of an Half-life (first one) mmo, without the fun parts. Clunky UI, combat, animations, enviroment and quests. I could see how it appeals to mmo-players, as all mmo's appeal to mmo-players. But on it's own merits it's awful. If your feeling nostalgic for 90's gaming (and graphics) ...or need a good laugh, que it up.
5304	0	a	I registered for the game and validated my email and could not log in, then found the name assigned to my account and tried that and still could not login.
5305	0	a	the gameplay ,weapons + equipment and the enviroment are dull. this is one game that doesnt make you hook up to it.
7888	1	a	so far so good tha graphics are pritty awsom and tha gameplay even better i really lioke tha custom character creation. i wil be recommending this game to my freindz
7890	1	a	ui is still unpolished compared to 'modern' mmo's. FE attempts to blend the action mmo and traditional mmo styles. Looks and feels almost Fallout-esque.
5308	0	a	Laggy and Boring Fallout runs better
5309	0	a	this game sucks and a waste of time to play
5310	0	a	kind of low
5311	0	a	This game has a ton of potenial to be a fallout-like MMO, but the pace is donkey slow. Many of the features are confusing, theres not many choices for an RPG, and the quests are so bland and boring, it would make a good Kardashian!  ~DMPGaming Official
5312	0	a	Fallen Earth is a fun little game, however the constant disconnects from the server is completely devistating to playing the game in my opinion. I still play but will no longer pay for anything due to the disconnects.
7892	1	a	Altough its weird, its ok.
5314	0	a	Dont play this piece of ♥♥♥♥! The video and screenshots lie to you. The game is so unoptimized, little customization, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ controls that you cannot comprehend how terrible it is. It is a complete and utter disgrace as a video game and waste of time.
7894	1	a	I Really Like this Game
7896	1	a	The main reason I am recomending this game is because of the fact that I can actually run it- that, and it is free.   The combat is quite poor, as you can be stabbed from 10 feet away, and the combat animations are subpar at best. Graphics look like they're from Chaser, and there is an odd way to go into First Person (by standing near a wall). Voice acting is pretty horrendous. Don't even get me started on one of the most clunky interface systems in any game I've ever played. Also, AI are mindless idiots at best.  Then again, I shouldn't expect much for a free game.  On to the positives then; the Character creation is cool, giving you a free range of choices that are not limited by any Premuim feature. The crafting system is intresting, making you have to scavenge for books full of useful info and techniques. Although I only have spent 2/3 hours, I can tell that the map is quite large.  Right now, I'd have to give the game a 6.5/10. Its okay, and if you have a crap computer like mine (windows 7) and can't run anything else, then this will provide some free little fun. If this gets enough ratings, I'll update my review. Thanks :)
7898	1	a	Amazing Realistic Video Game, set in the near future after a world disaster war/plague. Intense craft system, clan wars, open world pvp, REAL LIFE map based on real landmark of the Grand Canyon.
7900	1	a	I really enjoy the game. It's primarily PvE (my preference), but there are places around the map that are PvP so tread carefully. At least they give you a warning about entering the PvP areas.
7902	1	a	Brother game of DayZ ;)  Buy IT/Download IT
5319	0	a	this game is the most piece of ♥♥♥♥ game ever created i get 1 hitted by this guy ona computer rgenrated and hit again and died 0/10
5320	0	a	Game doen't even worth downloading,after that you need to check files check for updates and when you finish surprise you open a random door and game freezes.NOT GOOD GAME DO NOT PLAY IT!
7904	1	a	Its ok I guess
7906	1	a	I recommend it its nice game for those who like to explore, craft and do all crayzy stuuf in apocalypse !
7908	1	a	This Game,Just like The Days with Fallout But with some Random Player  And Also Some Co-op. I like When i play with my Friend Because Sometimes You Play You kinda Feel a Bit lonely But if you play with Friend, not anymore 'See enemy,Go prone,Take out Sniper rifles And Bang Together'
7910	1	a	decent, takes up too much memory though... great story so far though,pretty fast on my standard PC too!!!!
5323	0	a	worst game i ever played

5327	0	a	This in no way feels like a finished game. It's ugly, glitchy, and boring.
5328	0	a	Due to the fact that I couldn't log on even using my steam authentication right username and password this game proceeds to tell me that it is incorrect and on the website I registered on saying that my email and/or password is incorrect yet I typed it out so carefully the second time The help for registration is /EMPTY/ meaning if you have a question about registering on this game you have no chance on getting it answered unless someone you know has the knowledge of this This honestly ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off in the least possible time any game has ever done. I gave up on this and how some of you people log on will become an anomoly to me 0/10 would not recommend.
5329	0	a	Ugly, buggy, boring, repetetive. 1/10
7914	1	a	wasting tym but so nice
7916	1	a	Don't waste your time. It is a good game if you can get in. The launcher tries to update and after 8 hours to download a 141 mb file, has downloded 0%. MOVE ON. The latest verson appears to of fixed the launcher and is working good now.
5333	0	a	i was very annoyed when i downloaded a game and got a virus causing me to re install all my previous games
5334	0	a	melee hit 2-3 metres away??? OMG Such a waste! The game looks promising: not great graphics but it has something i really value and widely rare which is voice acting. But as soon as I had my very first fight I found melee hits from NPC's actually do damage even if you are pretty much away of them. That's just no right. This enough for me to throw the game into trash even if it's free2play.
5335	0	a	I played this game almost an hour, at the time the controls were horrible, and connections to the server were bad.
5336	0	a	wot is dis edit: Steam still recommends me this. If I wouldn't recommend this to someone then why would it recommend it to me?
5337	0	a	this game was not what it was made out to be in the trailer the best part of this game was the trailer 
5338	0	a	game wont load anymore just says connection error
5339	0	a	Horrible game, it doesn't even work properly.
5340	0	a	I can't even play the game, the EULA doesn't load!
5341	0	a	the game cool but you can only go so far without paying money and the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ bag in help chat are more worried about the stupid rules like no talking to other players and no CAP letter and other dumb ♥♥♥ rules...so unless you are willing to spend money (which this game is not that good) i wouldn't get it.
5342	0	a	I CANT EVEN LOG IN TO THIS ♥♥♥♥ING GAME

5345	0	a	Before I start my review, I would just like to point out that this is not from recent experience. I played this game about a year ago, and I hated it. First of all, I had to ask people how to enter FP perspective. Not that I think that it's the game's fault though. Anyways, the graphics are about as good as with a mixture of great models and horrible textures. Also, the reason I'm not reviewing it for the recent version is because when I started it up, all of the textures were missing, after downloading the 3+ GB game.   tl;dr: 1/10 would not apocalypse again.
5346	0	a	10/10 Would uninstall again!
7920	1	a	try it before you buy it
5347	0	a	dobt know how to login

5353	0	a	This is a terrible and boring game. Full of Hackers and annoying bugs.   Ignore this game and go play Fallout or something.
5354	0	a	10/10 Would uninstall again!
5355	0	a	Fallout for poor people...
7930	1	a	Nothing says apocalypse like a chick running around in a thong ;D
5361	0	a	i was never able to play the game.
5362	0	a	Um.. Where to even begin....    Pros;   -Free -Easy to learn -Good for teaching / good first game to get into if youre trying to learn how to games -Doesnt take up much space -Runs really well / Isnt CPU nor GPU sensitive      Cons;  -Poor/Uninteresting/Generic Story -Looks like... Well, Pixel games are better. -Extremely repetitive/boring gameplay. -Enemies have the skill and threat of a one legged kangaroo. -Theres only like... One of each type of gun. (Im serious...) -PayToEnjoy.
5363	0	a	Didnt know when the fun started.
7932	1	a	The things i liked : 1. crafting 2. survival 3. Massive Multiplayer 4.you can create almost anything ;)  The things i didn't liked :  1. you can have a little money problem in game ... but don't worry you will get some soon :D .    DOWNLOAD NOW!!!! :D and add me if you downloaded this i can help you ;)
7934	1	a	10/10 if i was high
7936	1	a	This game has such an indepth crafting and leveling system, and the community is very small so I would not reccomend this game for most people. If you love MMO's, RPG's, and FPS's, and you want to dedicate your time to an incredibly expansive game with a close community, than i would reccomend this game. It is a great game, but its certainly not for everyone.
7938	1	a	This game is like that game your Dad bought you because he thought it was cool and you play and it sucks but your too scared of telling your dad so you just smile and pretend to like it.
5365	0	a	Like a Fallout MMO but with horrendously broken mechanics and a pay-to-play system.
5366	0	a	Played for about an hour I think, it sucked...
5367	0	a	Lame game really not worth it there are better games with the same type
5368	0	a	1st game I actually do NOT recommend.  This games concept at first seemed quite appealing to me. I mean it really did. But after playing through the tutorial? It felt like I spent an hour on a tutorial(Not actually an hour though) And wasted that time. I never truly got to play through it farther but just me stopping at the beginning would lead me to just wasting more time on a game I didn't enjoy.  3/10 Wud not spoop again.
7940	1	a	Awesome game, little bit dated graphics but that really doesn't matter if the game is a good one and the right genre for you to enjoy. One itty bitty con though, most people who play seem to be either idiots or massive ♥♥♥♥♥♥.
5369	0	a	I played approximately 12 Hours of this Game and I achieved nothing, other than to discover that this Game is terrible. I began to realise after 500 corpses where towering behind Me that the combat in this Game is tedious, as You progress through the Game You shall encounter repetitive confrontations between You and the Enemies. The Free-roaming aspect of this Game is awful, don't get Me wrong I love the sense of freedom, having limited boundaries and usually this supports Games well, however Fallen Earth was destroyed by having this feature. For Games like The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim and Red Dead Redemption, they depend on their amazing Open-World features, since they do this - They excel. Fallen Earth is attempting to do this, whilst failing incredibly. If You are going to have an Open-World Game, You need to have some purpose while doing it, Fallen Earth supplies no graphical surroundings, just basic debris leftover from the Apocolypse. You can walk 500 Miles and pass the same settlements and AI, this is when it hit Me - Terrible Game! What supports it is that the Game is 'Free2Play', because that is all that it is worth.
7942	1	a	dis gam is fREE yeAH and it iz leik dat gam kalld FaLLOut ye bUT yes BUT ALLWES A BUTT dis Gam iz MUltYpLAYA YEEEEEE 10000000/10 WOWOWOWWOOWO  much fun
5371	0	a	It's good buy mostly boring.A bit of graphics improvement would be nice and sometimes I had problems in the laucher and had to log in-game sometimes ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off.Happened to all 3 computers I had. I'm lvl 36 got born of the game,missions were bland,vehicles meh didn't like em wished they sound realistic.  Combat: Should fix have an aiming system for the combat. This feels fresh at first as it hasn't been done an awful lot in MMORPGs to my knowledge, but the aiming isnt executed very well and doesn't go well together in combination with the rest of the combat. It feels out of place that you cant really dodge attacks in a system like this where moving and fighting can be done. Your enemies attacks can't miss you, but your attacks can miss them easily. The game's world is big, but empty. It has no interesting places to show off and the graphics aren't very pleasing either. I understand that this is supposed to be a post-apocalyptic setting but that doesn't mean everything in existance should not be very pleasing to the eye. The environments are already bland, empty and occasionally filled with resources and enemy mobs.
5372	0	a	Yeah... no.. Looking at it, I thought I'd get an open world post-apocalyptic survival game that I'd get addicted to. It turns out it's just a poorly made MMORPG with no excitment in it whatsoever. It's complete and utter bullcrap. If you're looking for a decent MMORPG, try Neverwinter, any of the Elder Scrolls games, Wizard/Pirate 101, or Star Wars the Old Republic. Most RPGS will be better than this, I guarantee you that.
7944	1	a	Good game overall. Combat is clunky for starters but you can learn them after a few hours of grinding. :D
7946	1	a	i like the game its open you can craft you can make camps its just cool 
5373	0	a	i can't believe people still play this !
5374	0	a	liek skyrim but with guns
7948	1	a	played many hours killed many people pissted off more people then i can care to count but sadly the game is dead and to this we thank the useless piece of ♥♥♥♥ company called G1 (gamersfirst) lol bs more like moneyfirst, their servers are ♥♥♥♥ they dont fix any issues with the game the only thing they care about is making money sucks to see what happened to such a great game ..l.. G1
7950	1	a	it a awsome game but you have to sign up for another site but its amazing when you play
7952	1	a	Fun game reminds me of Fallout.
7954	1	a	it a awsome game but you have to sign up for another site but its amazing when you play
7956	1	a	If you do not receive an e-mail within 5-10 minutes, please try registering your account again.  ... F*cking registering 50 times again and again.  10/10 would lose 1 hour again.  I recomend this game :/ 
5385	0	a	Seemed like a fun game despite the reviews, turned out to be a crappy bag of bugs. Don't play. Couldn't get past the tutorial from all the bugs.
7958	1	a	Fallen Earth is a free TPS/FPS. It takes place in the post-apocolyptic future where you have to scavenge items which are in bad condition like the items Questionable milk, Sklunky beer and Tainted meat. You complete missions which I guess revolves around a story. In this big open world Grand Canyon you can travel from a peaceful little village to a Flaming house Guarded by level 70 blade dancers with OP shivs. The graphics are ok but the combat mode on and off thing is a little annoying. It doesen't lag often but you need to either be really rich or premium to craft something good. 8/10 because I hate when premium is shoved in your face 
5388	0	a	ugh...
7960	1	a	Just gotta love the crafting system they have implemented in this game. Totally love it!
5391	0	a	Seemed like a fun game despite the reviews, turned out to be a crappy bag of bugs. Don't play. Couldn't get past the tutorial from all the bugs.
5392	0	a	Boring survival on apocalypse zombie game!
5393	0	a	I wish I could like this game but it felt like The Sixth Sense where the enemies nor players saw me to exist, the enemies if I attack first, but the players the commnity sucks, it is ok with a few friends but overall the mapsize feels like Runescape F2P and at one point people paid to buy this game and then paid a monthly fee, so I feel bad for those people that got robbed to play ♥♥♥♥♥♥ mmo grind gameplay in a Fallout subject and paid to do so...
5394	0	a	♥♥♥♥ this game dont think abowt getting it unless you wunna wait a week to get it to 22% update download!!!!
5395	0	a	requires that you make a gamersfirst account, never requires that you do NOT make a username and then requires it when logging in to the game
7962	1	a	Fallen Earth its my best MMO RPG-ACTION-ADVANTURE-PVP-PVE-RAID-CLAM-FIGHT-SURVIVAL-OPEN WORLD-CRAFTING-ZOMBIE-CO-OP-FPS/TPS and of curse ![Post-Apocalyptic]!  so im really RECOMMEND this game for all who love MMoRPGs Games  and thnx  leave like yo!
7964	1	a	not bad gut crafting takes to long
5397	0	a	Fallen Earth is an excelent thought, but it has crapy controlles and graphics. They also did not put a lot of time on fixing glitches in the graphics.I would not recommend this to anyone that wants to have fun.
5398	0	a	Very idiot Logic,some enemy can hit you with 10 m with an axe,or when you pass them with a motorbike,ythey will hit you with a small knife from 50m...very buggy,and the premium boxes worth nothing
5399	0	a	i can't believe people still play this !
7966	1	a	I like he ''Mad Max'' feeling of this game, it's a great idea overall. But it would've been great if the developers tried to interact with their fellow fans.
7968	1	a	This is the best rpg game that ive played in along time, since starwars galaxy i recomend playing it cuz its so cool you can build a house ride horses,cars,monsters and more theres so much you can do plz play the game.
7970	1	a	Very interesting, blending FPS into a gritty-looking survival/crafting game. It is definitely quite a game, and very much worh a look if you are okay with making another account somewhere else. This game does revolve around gathering, so you will find yourself stopping a lot to get things that you may want or need, but it doesn't hinder the game in my opinion, as it doesn't feel like 'farming' in the traditional MMO sense, but in a survival sense, since this is about you surviving in this post apocalyptic world. Definitely fun to RP with, I can tell you that. X3
7972	1	a	good game werry fun to play i recomend this game you can craft cars buy houses i think custimise car yourself good online 10-10
5400	0	a	well its ok. at first when i played this game i thought 'Wow this is really cool' and then as the first mission ended its hard to find new missions and such stuff to keep urself entertained. So basically, its pretty OK in the beginning then after that it just gets boring. Rate: 5/10
5401	0	a	the main reason that i would not recommend this game is due to when ever i start the game it goes into a grey screen and as far as i know i cant fix it. unless there is a suggestion on how to fix this bug my gameplay experience is ruined and i will continue to dislike this game. 
7974	1	a	Still as enjoyable as when i played a few years back:)
7976	1	a	not bad gut crafting takes to long
5403	0	a	After nearly a year away from the game, I came back. First thing I did was get rid of my old useless starter character. I created a new one in a few minutes. I arrived in the starter area after a few loading screens AND, that is as far as I got. The lag was so intense that my game froze three times in two minutes. The server lag is more than just a nuiscance, it is quite literally fatal. As I write this, Fallen Earth is waiting to respond in the background. This game, I have some fond memories from it. Now I'll never be able to relive them.  These Developers also created APB Reloaded. I love and hate that game, but Fallen Earth was always so dear to me. The Dev's really should have focused more on FE than APB. This game gives you so much more progressive choice than APB's 'you need to level up your standing with this person to get socks,' outlook.   I can't recommend you buy this game. Look at other reviews as well. They will show you what is truly going on right now, even if like me you don't get to see it for yourself. Good luck Clones, I will miss every one of you.
5404	0	a	was more fun uninstalling than playing
5405	0	a	how do u make an account it doesnt work
5406	0	a	I didn't get to play this game, nor am I going to bother trying ever again. I downloaded the 5.4GB from Steam in about 30-40mins yesterday, but then before I could actually play the game it apparently had to update. No problem I thought as it is just a 130MB update. However it said it was going to take 11 hours to download the 130MB update, when it should take less than 1min! I gave up after an hour and assumed it was a problem that would be resolved the following day. It is slightly faster, my wait time is down to 3 hours now, but that is 3 hours too long for me. By the time this update finishes they will have released another one.   Frankly the game doesn't look like it is worth the hassle or the wait, not to mention the fact that poor servers don't bode well for an online game. I am going to get my 5.4GB (plus the 25MB update) back. I'd advise that you avoid this game and don't waste your time or your hard drive space.
5407	0	a	*Edit* I have more hours in this game than steam has reported  This could have been a exceptional game. The devs are completely out of touch with what direction they should take this game. Crafting is more or less useless, which makes gathering useless which in turn makes 50% of the game meaningless. PvP is hard to get into. It's geared to favor those who have been playing for a long time rather than skill. PvM is buggy, enemies can melee you from a distance, kinda reminds me of SWG in that reguard.   This is one of those games that could have been really great. But its also one of those games where the devs listened to a fraction of the player base and now you have a bad game with hardly any players. Those players who are active consider themselves elite.   The devs have promised so much in the past, such as housing, better more meaningful crafting and gathering, BALANCED PvP. and over the years only minor bug fixes are what they give.  I cant recommend this game as it is. It almost like its in constant beta. Such a shame.
7978	1	a	Everyone is either really good and gets to level 50 in an hour Or hangs around clinton FARM and is bad.
5409	0	a	Its awful i cannot even get this to work.
5410	0	a	I'm sure it would be a good game if the download process ever finished. Took an hour of a continuous loop for me to lose interest. Don't think I'll be bothered trying again.
5411	0	a	Dear makers of this wonderful and very entertaining game...  Shove this *thing* up your arses! Wanna know why? Well.. let's start from the beginning, shall we?  First of all this game is free... that mean that the persons that created it must be nuts to let it be free. Of course, it's free and that means that they must find a way to make money out of it one way or another. And that means P2W. And if we hold for a minute and think it's a good thing. You must get your money out for the effort that you've put into this game. But... to make two separate classes... the poor ones that play for free.... and the rich ones who invest good money just to be better than the rest and of course, to win. Well. With that said... we arrive at the subject that I've wanted to express. To make a game like this one and to ruin the good time of it... that is a crime. Maybe I was in a bad mood. But it takes you like 1 to 2 hours for an effect to dissapear for you to be able to view the ironsight. That is the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ttiest thing that I've encountered in a game in my entire life. And for what? For the *sickness* to dissapear and when it does to tell you that you must pay money for the ironsight? Oh no! NO! This game broke my day. And the rest of them. How can a man / or men could think of such ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. And don't you tell me ,, Well, it didn't pop that I have to pay money for the ironsight'' cause someday a person will introduce that into a game. And when that day comes, you can be sure that I for one will throw that game out of the window.  Passing on... the rest of the game is ok. It has first person view, and that is a good thing for a F2P. The gameplay is very entertaining, I'll give it that. Don't believe me? JUST PLAY IT AND FIND OUT FOR YOURSELF!
5412	0	a	Meh, pvp full of botters, gms ban for nothing, just not fun anymore....
5413	0	a	Meh, pvp full of botters, gms ban for nothing, just not fun anymore....
5414	0	a	Walked into hallway, walls explode with texture glitches. Tried playing anyway, until I realized I was playin futuristic Runescape with a lot less work put into it. I'm not 10 anymore, so I didn't like it. Even if I was still 10, I wouldn't like this game because it sucks. The AI is something I could surpass with HTML5 script, even though you can't use HTML5 to write AI. UI is so bad that trying to do anything is as complicated as the thoughts that go through Stephen Hawking's head. 5 gigs of wasted storage, 2 hours of wasted time. Do not download this game, if you do, you support isis.
5415	0	a	Crafting takes time.I want that time back
5416	0	a	i dont see anything worthwhile in this game everything sucks 10/10 would unnistal again
5417	0	a	This Game Was Fun when It Came Out. I was And Original Member before Steam. I played It also when Gamers 1st Took over they Did A great Job in the Beginning. I just Joined Again and Prepaid for My Wife And myself. But Unfortunatly I could Not reccommend The Game Any Longer As the Devs No longer Support it. And They Are letting the Game Die. The community if Very Good Mostly Diehards Like myself. if your just looking for a free Gameplay It might be worth your time but I won't be Paying another sub As it feels They Are just taking our Money And putting nothing back Into the Game. I really With gamers 1st Would let someone who cares about the Game take it over as it was So fun and the Game Concept was Well Written
5418	0	a	Very boring, lack luster graphics and has choppy gameplay mechanics. I would stay away from it but since it's free, try it yourself!
5419	0	a	wouldnt let me log in. made two accounts still wouldnt let me log in. this game sucks
5420	0	a	played when i was 12 (now i am 16) when i did not have money  i wanted fallout  i got this people tricking noobs (like me) in to pvp  then spawn camping  then they give you a gun and says its a super rare gun which does nothing   -10/1000 would play if had boobs
7980	1	a	this has the makings of a good game, too bad the online community on it sucks :/
5421	0	a	Glitched out on me, didnt get past the intro; 11/10 to not play again
7982	1	a	poor mans fallout
5422	0	a	A cycle that seems to be unfortunately common with games like this. Originally it was an excellent, albeit, slow-paced MMO. Open-world with a cool Mad Max style to it that promoted cooperation. You don't have supplies or can't kill something? Join a clan and they can hook you up with materials or supplies, even help you kill what you need. The game even had active GMs that were usually pleasant and active in the game's community.   AND THEN IT SWITCHED DEVELOPERS!  The new developers couldn't maintain the old-timers so the community took a nose dive into spiked floor. Whoever is left from the old days now puts their rivalries aside so they can at least have something to do. Overall, it's a shadow of its former self with a dead/dying community. HOWEVER don't take my word for it, I admittedly haven't played in months and could very well have a somewhat active community again.  While this is obviously a 'back in my day...!' review, I'm giving it a negative rating. The game is free so try it out for yourself and you may actually like it.
7984	1	a	Brilliant game and a entertaining MMORPG, my only gripe is where is the Mac version of the game at present its only available on steam for windows?
5428	0	a	I love the Fallout series,so I tried to play this game,unfortunately,I didn't like it,bad models,bad gameplay,I didn't play it a lot,but it was enough to show me that this game,is a Fallout rip-off.
5429	0	a	Pros:   Decent Community PvP 'was' decent Character cosmetics are good  Cons:  Bug filled Terrible Gms  Terrible Customer Service Filled with Aimboters Filled with item dupers Game economy is trash No constant updates Not much RP Not Much PvP Boring Low Community numbers 
5430	0	a	The game is overall decent at best. It is definitely a survivial game no doubt about that, however it is old and has some a terrible gameplay in my opinion i believe the game would be pretty good if you could control the player as in many newer MMO's.. Another thing i instantly noticed is that crafting takes time and better items take longer time, makes it realistic but not what im looking for really. The fact that you craft whilst you fight, hunt, mine, ride makes no sense at all. Whenever i did something it didn't feel right, for me the game had no story/intro/movie that really said yes this is the reason im here.   Overall the gameplay is just too old for me.. and no story? nah.. sry..
7986	1	a	Waste of time.
7988	1	a	This game was really Awesome but the crafting like really Really 20 hrs to craft a speedster(&lt;car) cmon i mean for the atv and that is all okay but takes forever to get stuff but its time comsuming but the main thing is y i got it is bc theres over 600 achivements :D and i wantem all :) all and its really fun but really hard to make money but to get rid of it easy i was wipen my but with money till i ran out :( but really fun game  
5438	0	a	This game is full of minor but very irritating bugs (especially the UI), none of which have been fixed since I tried it three years ago. I strongly suspect that the owners (who, I believe, are not the original developers) are in 'Maintenance Mode', milking the game until players tire of it, but not adding any improvements or fixing any but the most serious of issues. Just on this basis alone, it is hard to justify sinking any money into it, which means you will be stuck with the sub-standard F2P experience.  Even if the bugs were fixed, though, the game utterly fails at narration: none of the characters are memorable. The missions, though ostensibly varied by their flavor text, ultimately feel very samey. How many times was I told to 'defend your location'? In one of the last missions I did, I had to go deep, deep into a prison to kill a boss. It was hard to find him, and at one point I had to traverse a corridor almost literally packed with enemies, who stood there blankly while I murdered their comrades 4 meters in front of them. I finally got to the boss, the culmination of all the mission stories in the zone. There was no dialogue or confrontation; he just attacked me, and what ensured was a long, long fight (due to his massive amount of health) where I tried to cut him to pieces with my knives, while he shot me in the face with a pistol. It's too bad, because his story was kind of interesting. (He was cloning himself, and apparently one of his clones decided to lead the resistance against him.)  Combat is tedious, and (for my melee build) mostly consisted of holding down both mouse buttons while aiming the reticule at an enemy. This is made difficult mostly by the camera, enemies' poor pathfinding -- which frequently causes them to run around unnaturally before they home in on you -- and the facts that the game occasionally ignores your keystrokes and gives little or late feedback when it does detect your keystrokes.  There are good things about this game -- otherwise I wouldn't have spent as much time with it as I did -- but I'm not motivated to list them here, because mostly what I feel about it now is frustration.
5439	0	a	this ♥♥♥♥ blows 
5440	0	a	Haven't even played this game yet, BECAUSE I CANT!  I downloaded the game which took about 40 minutes at over 1.9 KB's   Then on the updater the updating speed was about 50 kbs! WHICH IS OUTRAGEOUS! The time to update said over 17 hours. I waited about 20 minutes and then gave up.  Screw this game, Screw the updater.  Was thinking about buying some perk/donating BUT I CANT PLAY   Ridiculous.
5441	0	a	Interesting concept that falls flat with the poor and unpolished gameplay, not many positives seeing as so many games have done this, but better and still free to play. The only way I'd recomend this game is if someone wanted the experience solely for the poorely developed story, time period and post apacolyptic vibe.   In short, it sucks.
5442	0	a	sorry but thanks to problems starting the gamei uninstall then when i did the game workd fine but i allready uninstall it soo no im installing it again wating WAYSTING MY TIME DOING SOO NOW I HAVE TO WAIT 2 OR 3 AHOURS MORE!!!!!!!!!!

5443	0	a	Fallen Earth at first glance seemed like a good game, and it seemed to have a a good story, but it's gameplay is something to be desiered and not worth the time to download.
5444	0	a	Dull system, dull quests, dull story, dull interface, dull graphics, dull sound... need I go on?

5450	0	a	Most stupidest and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game ever.. i dont recommend this stupid game..uninstalling now itself..
5451	0	a	Haven't even played this game yet, BECAUSE I CANT!  I downloaded the game which took about 40 minutes at over 1.9 KB's   Then on the updater the updating speed was about 50 kbs! WHICH IS OUTRAGEOUS! The time to update said over 17 hours. I waited about 20 minutes and then gave up.  Screw this game, Screw the updater.  Was thinking about buying some perk/donating BUT I CANT PLAY   Ridiculous.

5457	0	a	boring
5458	0	a	Game was poop when I actually bought it in 2011. Very confuseing, no help from anyone, bugged quests, unclear ability uses and stat description....... an all around fail. The only cool thing about it was the vehicles and haveing to buy gas and what not, because the version I got gave me a quad.
5459	0	a	Can't get past the load screen, try 3 times, game fails to download, finally get to character customization screen, game crashes again, now the game fails to load.  Blame the government, man.
5460	0	a	Its free, no game should EVER need to update in game. if your going to download it over steam NEVER EVER EVERRRRRRRR MAKE YOU SIGN UP ON A ALTERNATE WEBSITE AND HAVE TO UPDATE IN GAME. other than that i have not even played the game because of that!

8004	1	a	It's Good I guess. O.O
5482	0	a	Well, i played this game about 1 year ago + and it was nice game i enjoyed it it was original something new for me like a apocalyptic games fan and MMORPG i was excited but now.... its trash all i can say.
5483	0	a	Deleted this game, after endless re installs, couldn't get the game to load past the character generation screen,
5484	0	a	The game its not fun at all, the control are really weird, and also the weapons are glitchy it completely weird. I pretty sure it not gonna fix it because its old and abandoned
8006	1	a	lol i love this game it is the best  
5485	0	a	This game is dead. I used to play it and now its completely dead. Dont waste your time. It used to be good but now its dead and riddled with hackers. The Devs dont give a ♥♥♥♥ about it and gamersfirst is a cancer that ruins everything it touches. I say again, Dont bother with this game anymore.
5486	0	a	Well Had to Update this review!  My first opinion do not get this game at all. Why? Because just to start up the game it takes about 15 minutes. Secondly Its very repettative. Thirdly its story line is kill this kill that, earn a bike and car and just wander nothing really intresting. Last but not least the skill this game requires to do somethings is outrageous it would say something like science 23/90 Or whatever your skill is out of 90 Who in the hell dose not know how to take apart a fridge and look for parts like really?  Now the pros  The vast selection of weapons well the names so weapons are just stronger with a diffent name but same model. The Vast map, The map is very large with 8 sectors of explorable land. There is nothing holding you back from exploring the map except for the dam enemy. Usally once you hit a differnt sector you will always get 1 hit.
8008	1	a	this is a written review
5488	0	a	Ok so lets start with the controls....just awful people are calling it 'complex' but its just very clunky and i can say the same for the combat all you do is spam left click till you or the enemy fall over it also looks reallly reallly really really bad lol this game needs a TON of work and i dont think its gonna get the work that it needs so in my opinion its not worth the space it takes up on ur computer
5489	0	a	cant login:  this looks like an AWESOME game, but you cant login/create an account. this is a real shame as it looks like a brilliant game
5490	0	a	fallen earth is a good game but it need`s some work I like it but unturned is much beter go and play it it free to play
5491	0	a	It's like fallout..except it's not fallout and fallout is way better. go play fallout instead.
8010	1	a	On first impressions... The idea behind the game is nice and I like the story line. The controls are difficult in the beginning but after a while you get used to the configuration. A BIG problem is the combat. You can't hear when you take damage and there is no active audio for combat, so while in combat there is only silence. When you are engaged in a fight it feels like you are swinging at rather than a target, and when you shoot you cant hear the shot so you do not really know if you hit or missed.  But these are all things that can be fixed in the future. I love the base foundation of the game and I feel ONCE THE BUGS ARE FIXED it will be a good edition your game library.
8012	1	a	I know this game has been out a while but I just got it recently. I have roughly 39 ish hours into it and I like it. Its fun, It can be a bit grindy with all the walking until you get some fast travel locations unlocked and getting your first quad ( Still havnt managed to get mine yet) is a ♥♥♥♥♥ by yourself. If your looking for a Fallout experiance then go play Fallout, however it does remind me a bit of it. The customisation is pretty awsome and you can build literally anything you want, wich is what is appealing to me about this game the most. Takes patience though. All in all its an enjoyable game.
8014	1	a	The size of the game is impressive. Character develepment is complicated but learnable through help from more experianced players.  My only complaint is the number of trolls in pvp.
8016	1	a	I enjoyed this game, up until the 'how I horse' questions bore through my skull like a diamond bullet. I never really joined a clan, but I did team up with people now and then. Can't say as a single player that I have had too many people try to kill my characters (factions). Haven't played in awhile, but my recollections was that the mods were very helpful, the forums full of information, and the pace was easy and slow (for some parts). Grinding is what you have to do and I got tired of it.
8018	1	a	This game can be addicting when it comes to collecting materials and crafting, I always been fond of crafting in any game and a horder of materials... In that respect there is tons to do in this game and you will spend a lot of time on it.  As for the questing/leveling aspect it can be quite boring, the quests interface and actual quests are the old fashioned go here kill this amount etc...   The graphics are a bit dated as well as the pathing with the AI mobs.  PVP can sometimes be frustrating at least for me and this game can be very unforgiving for new people who havent leared all the ins and outs about making a good build for their character.  At times the game lacks the feel of a living world as real people can sometimes be far in between, for this reason you should find a clan. Overall I have mixed feelings on the game but its worth a try considering you can play for free.
8020	1	a	I Didnt figure out the system to play, but i think its decent for a f2p!
5495	0	a	Its peice of crap game has aweful graphics its a ripoff of borderlands that sucks sincerly_SvenonPCin1080p
5496	0	a	this game is crap played for a bit and i just wanted to kill my self there are a lot better survival games out there just don't pick this one

5499	0	a	Its says survival but no its not. 
5500	0	a	i played for a bit then a vet told me it was a total waste of time and honestly he must be right i had way more fun trolling the weirdos that where what appaired to be in mid 30s do their best to build bonds with what i can only assume to be helmat wearing 12 year olds asking the most truly useless questions i resorted to witty interjections within 2 hrs or so after going thru an oh so vinilla tut and then comeing out playing not only as a clone but also a poor clone with bits hacked togeather from other games with 0 new mechanics in fact the only reason i am writing this is cause i am now so board i felt t would be more fu to type then like log on and play TOTAL WASTE OF TIME AND DISKSPACE
5501	0	a	this is the worst post-apocalyptic rpg i have ever played. play fallout instead of this.
5502	0	a	Pros: The idea seemed cool. Poorly executed though.  Cons:  Clunky Controls, C**p gameplay, Pay 2 Win, 12 year old staff members with the ability to Powerflex when they choose to, and the list goes on.  Took me a few hours to download it, took me 5 minutes for Eric Cartman the moderator to find me and start talking smack and ban me because I refused to respect his authority despite him just being a massive do**he nozzle towards new players. Wasted so much bandwidth trying to play this s**t game. Would not recommend even p**sing in this games direction.
8024	1	a	Never was able to play it.
5503	0	a	Wont get load beyond the launch screen
5504	0	a	Its says survival but no its not. 
5505	0	a	its ♥♥♥♥ thats all cant play it i was spending 1 hour trying to open and play the game but you see its ♥♥♥♥ so just dont play it right when i got there i only played this gam like 5 min and it got boring and dum so dont play this game its just waste of time
8026	1	a	Apparently I played this for .3 hours some time in the past. I do not remember this. So either something's wrong with Steam, or this game has nothing worth remembering.  I don't even remember how I got to the store page to see that I was able to write this 'review'. WHAT IS THIS SORCERY?  Recommended because possible timewarp/10.
8028	1	a	Basicly Fallout online but not because of copyrights ;P
5507	0	a	A game that looked interesting to me leading me to buy it. after creating my character, my game would always crash before i made it to the end of the tutorial
8030	1	a	Had it, kinda was confused on what to do ._.. Sort of like fallout but for free??
8032	1	a	game is grate  it has realy good atmosfer  has all that one mmo shuld have and is more compexs them most of mmo-s if u wana easy and shalow game dot play this  this is no lifer :)  W GG
5509	0	a	i couldnt even play the damn game. i made my character simple enough but the moment i stepped into the starting area the game froze. so i waited until it unfroze and it did. once it unfroze i looked around with the camera and no issues. then i tried moving and froze again. repeted multiple times. apperently this is common and reproducable. the tells me that whom ever made this game either doesnt care about it or are dropping the game altogether. but all in all until this huge issue with the game is resolved you won't see me anywhere near it.
8034	1	a	I like this game a lot! I have played the Fallout series and it is simliar to this. Graphics are nice and there are tons of recipes. There is a lot of reading involved and you have to follow what the charecters diretions well.
5511	0	a	this game is not letting me play i make an account and it said to verify the email i did that and i went to login but the game would not let me
5512	0	a	They drowned the thought of a nice 'post apocalyptic' game, then drowned it in cyanide, proceded to smash it with a brick, and then threw it into a ditch.  19/45 - Hitler would cry
5513	0	a	Well, what can I say about this amazing game?  + For sure it's definitely better than the overhyped Fallout 4. - Graphic wise, it's not as good as Fallout 2, + but in terms of multiplayer and price, Fallout 4 can't beat that. + If you ignore the Freemium stuff, it can be pretty fun. Great community who are always happy to help you out. + Not sure what the negative reviews were about, as I have never encountered the said bugs. + But hey, at least it's better than APB Reloaded, right?  UPDATE #1: Now that I have spent at least 300 non-Steam hours I have some polished thoughts to share. + The humor and references present in the game is endless and incredible. Some of them are just meant to make you laugh. Not many game developers cared to do that. On a free game. + 650 achievements might seem a lot, but it takes time. It may seem grindy, but it's not. They are there to make sure you know something about the game (discover a town, complete their missions, unlocking their secrets etc.), not just spamming the kills and skills. + There are more than 500 weapons available (both melee and ranged), some of them provide different attribute boosts. + The game is not even dead. Those who say the game is dead probably never entered the /Global channel (you need to be a Freemium for that) which is very much alive.  UPDATE #2: I have discovered the Dark Side of the game (didn't even receive any cookies) - I started to have a lot of achievement bugs: achievements that do not get unlocked even the requirements are met. The devs never cared to fix them. One of the representatives on the forums replied 'it's random'... - Adding salt to the problem, help is harder to get nowadays with only the help of the unofficial wiki (which is so much incomplete even until now). I noticed third-party sites that supposedly provided more information or secrets about the game which little people knew about, were disabled (By Devs?). Players lingering on the /help channel do not have enough experience to deal with advanced issues, Hazmat volunteer helpers come online only at certain times of the day, GMs don't come online anymore (even if they do they'll log in in Ninja mode and spy on all of us)... so you see, it's terrible - Devs can lay the banhammer on absolutely anyone permanently without giving whatsoever reasons at any time, whether you may be a suspect of cheating or not. (Needs updating)  All in all, I think FE is ideal for you if you want to play it for a short period of time (say, ~200 hours), avoid being too immersed in the game like i did).  Update as of 25/11/2016: Dupers ruining the market, botters killing PvP, rerolls everywhere. that's just how you want the game to end.  Personal rating:  5.5  3.5/10
5514	0	a	You can uninstall this. 11/10 IGN
5515	0	a	It's exactly as if they took all the bad parts and mechanics of fallout and packed it into a game.

8036	1	a	If it wasn't for all the damn Bugs, I'd play more. It may not have the best graphics, but for it's like a Fallout MMO type style. I could get lost for days on this game

5521	0	a	♥♥♥♥ this Game
5522	0	a	Im not saying this is a bad game.. im saying its an awful game the controls feel clunky the aiming feels clunky... it just feels clunky basicly lol.  i loved the idea behind the game but sadly these creators couldnt turn the good idea into a good reality
5523	0	a	When the only thing you have going for your game is a Kotaku quote, you know your game is really ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥.
5524	0	a	this game is honestly worth less than nothing
5525	0	a	it's sucks 
8038	1	a	I've played this game on and off over the years. I met some great people as well. I really like the quests and crafting system. Feels a lot like a pay to win kind of game, but it's free to play, so income has to come in some way. The only thing that's sad about it is the player base. In S1 there are plenty of people to run into. As you go on, it gets far more empty. Maybe one day it'll recover, but overall I would recommend it. Just be sure to bring friends along.
5528	0	a	pay 2 win game and cant place it but gameplay just feels off.
5529	0	a	I do not recommend this game to anyone. 1. The sign up process is too long and not worth it. 2. The graphics are terrible, no where near the quality of the pictures.. and even those aren't the best. 3. The control configuration is too much. You use the awsd to walk like most other games, but insteas of using your mouse or trackpad to look a certain way, you have to use the arrows.. poorly designed. And to fight, or shoot. You have to click the middle button on your mouse to be able to go into 'Aim-mode'. To look down the sight of your gun, you have to hold B which is highly inconvenient. And the combat in the game is terrible, there's no blocking, nothing. You just walk up to an opponent and hold down the attack button and hope for the best. Overall, this game is like a 2-3 outta 10. I definitely understand why it's free, even then. I still don't recommend it to anyone. Terrible game.
8040	1	a	Awsome game Should make it so that you can pick stuff up off the ground and so that you can ractivate your acount after you get banned

8044	1	a	this is a very fun game. the problem is the quests can be hard, they can drag, and it takes a long time to travel if you do not have a horse.
5537	0	a	No its just bad i had bugs, alot of em. also its content is just Crap! Worth your time? Nope
5538	0	a	slights bugs where sound would cut out and only voices owuld be playing, and i didnt like the gameplay. the concept of a post apocalyptic mmo is really interesting but this one isnt worth the download
5539	0	a	♥♥♥♥ . don`t try
5540	0	a	This game... This game is one of those game that you enjoy uninstalling more then playing the actual game and that is because of various reasons: 1. The game is no longer supported. 2. The game is very buggy and glitchy. 3. Only fun when getting really far through it. 4. Crashing non stop. 5. Srsly why am i keeping reviewing it like few years after it got out, we all know it sucks.
5541	0	a	Was one of the best Steam free to play games. Now it's just trash.
8046	1	a	Hy I think this is a precursor to some survival games like vegas ?
8048	1	a	good game, nothing eslse just play it and tell me then 
8050	1	a	Fallen Earth is a quite good game sometimes, but other times its like WHAT THE... The good thing about it is that the maps are huge and once you get up a good level you will be getting some good stuff.
8052	1	a	11/10 not enuff PVP
8054	1	a	Very Good game. A bit slow on crafting . Otherwise if you love a good 'Shootem up' compleat with crafting(slow). This is the game for you.
8056	1	a	It reminds me of fallout except you get 42 diffrent attributes in total to edite from your 4 ability tabs. Stat, Skills, Mutation, and Trade Skills. No redistrubting skill points once you commit. Mutation is more like super powers. And if you ever wanted fallout to have mounts, well this game surely full fills that dream. You get horses, cool diffrent cars, motorcycles, and all types of other freaky type animal mounts. Character creation isn't to bad. The amount of choices you get when deciding how your character is going to look is good enough to satisfy you, without being so shallow as to not give you enough to work with in that area. They're are no race types because the story doesn't support that type of gameplay. Speaking of which, to me the story is only okay, but most surely isn't chessy. C+ from me in that area. I play a lot of games so I know a good story when I play one, but in actaulity the game is so fun you wont realy care. The game has Clans you can join, temporary Teams you can make when your grinding trying to level up or even to beat missions, and you can duel. The only thing I found wrong with this game is that you have to repair your equipment yourself, everything you get is iether you made it, bought it from another player, or you did a mission, and to make equipment you have to learn that ability for that specific equipment Type like: Guns, Melee etc., but sometimes all you want to do is just pay for repair or buy, and just go. Overall this game has an A. Very much worth your time to download and play.
8058	1	a	I really love the free roam on this game its almost like a nuclear GTA. I give it a thumbs up.
8060	1	a	*Grahpics are DECENT Not great but decent  *Weapons are a little OP  *Great game  Rating:7/10
8062	1	a	This game has come a long way since its first inception, and even more since going F2P. Totally worth it if you enjoy traveling the wasteland.
5552	0	a	this game is complete ♥♥♥♥...u have to make an account, tats the part that pisses me off and then the game dosent work. i would rate this game a -100000000000000000out of 10 thats how much i ♥♥♥♥ing hate it

5554	0	a	THIS IS SOME HIGH TECH ♥♥♥♥.
8064	1	a	Hy I think this is a precursor to some survival games like vegas ?
5560	0	a	I went into this game thinking it would be like Dying Light or Fallout. It turned out the game is like World of Warcraft or Star Wars: The Old Republic. Don't get me wrong, I like those games, but the pictures were misleading, and I was in the mood for a game like Dying Light, so when it gave me the MMO create-your-character screen, I was not entertained. If you like/ want to play an MMO, download the game, if you want a zombie survival, keep looking.
8066	1	a	I would like to start off with stating that this is a review from someone who is just the average player and has gotton a very good look at the game..so far. Now I will state what you will notice right away! The combat im not going to lie is very bland and there is not many ways to approch at enemys. The missions are straight forword and doing the side missions proves to be your main source of income other then crafting and selling gear to other players. There is no lack of missions as I may stay in the some main Starter towns but on my way to a mission get side tracked and find a new town, then Im there for a few play times doing those missions. By the time I realize I have forgotton to do the mission I came for at the start of collecting like 10 copper for example im killing roaches for sugar cookies from so random guy. The missions in each town are mostly focused towards a area, so collecting 5 at a time is better then 2 becuase you will find you are walking to hand in a mission to realize the next mission you find is in the same area like 10 feet from where you did the last. There is not too much to say for the gameplay as if follows the bases of most. The leveling and skills is a very nice system in the game that is easy to understand and you can really see how your upgrades effect the game. The crafting is very time conruming but it pays off when you can create good gear and sell it for big profit cause you put in the time and grinded. The graphics are ok for a game of its age but it does have many textures that are used to often. The game for overall enjoyment is a 7/10 for games in its group as it has some elements that are not in the basic template for most.
5572	0	a	Boring i was expecting it to be a fps but its a boring mmo with crap combat
5573	0	a	this game absoloutly sucks
8068	1	a	If there was a fallout online, and it had a massive dump, this game would be that dump.   Good community, once you reach the areas they hang out in. When you start, the game will put you clean off and you may very well quit. It has massive maps, and the starting map is very empty, you'd be forgiven for thinking the game was about to shut down due to no players. I quit the first time i played, but if you keep at it, you'll locate the player community on the third section.   I got a good few hours in the game, I really enjoyed the clans and the big drama they all love to cause. You'll find the Devs are friendly and you get to know them after a while.  give the game a try, hell it's free so why not.

8072	1	a	Took six hours to install the game. Took another two hours installing updates. All this to crash repeatedly on start up. 9/10 great progress bar simulator.
5578	0	a	This is the SWG of Post Apocalyptic MMOs:  Pros Great Concepts/systems fantastic crafting system genius handling of mounts and item decay  Cons absolutely ♥♥♥♥ execution. no content. like at all.  mash up the crafting systems and mounts of this, the housing and resource/crafting systems of SWG and build a free-aim combat system that handles like an FPS (cough cough, Fallout 4, Cough Cough) and you would have a Godking of an MMO 
5579	0	a	so ugly cant stand it, not worth my time !
8074	1	a	If you love being constipated . . .  This game is for you.  It's slow, clunky, chunky and dry.   Personally, I couldn't wait to hit the Ex(lax)it button.
5582	0	a	Pros - Free play  Cons - All the rest -- too many bugs -- too many glitches -- too many quest with idea 'defend your position'.. and the enemy become from nowhere and there were too much for one, without no notice -- craft system is thinking to spend too much time, but you can pay-for-fast-craft (mostly last)
5583	0	a	More free garbage. Terrible control. Don't bother!
5584	0	a	It wouldn't let me play soooo good luck?
5585	0	a	I was dropped into the game with no understanding of it, i was given no useful inforation from the game, i wondered around clicking everything i could and nothing happened. The most fun i had was uninstalling
8076	1	a	Amazing ! I just got 3500 RP code for totally FREE ! Come and download code too    &gt;&gt;  {LINK REMOVED}  http://RiotPoint.eu/  &lt;&lt;
8078	1	a	This game is so amazing.  The Uninstall button works like a charm.  10/10 would uninstall again.
5596	0	a	I downloaded this game hoping to hae a nice time on it, only to be forced to sign the license multiple times, and to download the updates multiple times. I couldn`t even get the game started, stay away from this game unless you want to waste 20 minutes of your life.
5597	0	a	this game is sooooo bad. Physics are terrible, no sounds when walking, shooting, punching, i will never play this game again be the way this game's graphics are bad and in pictures are better but... I don't recommend to play this game.
8080	1	a	Yes and no! I think it has potential if some developers took it and optimized it.  I got to level 10 and it got boring but I kept it installed just in case. I came back and played for a few days and then stoped. Went back for a few more days and the stop. Slowly but surely I got to the highest level (only took me 3 1/2 years)! I wasted my life and you should too!
8082	1	a	this game ran like ♥♥♥♥ on my old computer its graphics are not the best but i should run on my pc which btw cant run dirty bomb so if you like a good mmo without killing players also known as the best part of day Z and instead a good story you get this game and btw you might not need the super graphic card to run this game like a boos 
5600	0	a	this is nothing more than a pathetic attempt at fallout clone
8084	1	a	I just got this game today and I'm already in love with with it. This is definatly one of the absolute best MMO's I've played, even more so then ESO, I'd have to say at this point. I love the game, though you really do have to spend like an hour scavenging materials just to get a little amount of ammo because you'll need it, ammo runs outin this game like crazy. So just be conservative. All in all, great game, hope it's around for years to come :)
5601	0	a	This game is Fallout 3 with a few expections.  It has no atmosphere, you will feel like you are not even playing a game. The graphics were ripped out of a toaster. I understand graphics don't make the game but Jesus. The combat feels like a point and click adventure. Without the adventure. The gameplay was as smooth sandpaper.  0/10 Couldn't uninstall it fast enough.
8086	1	a	Never played this game steam says i have so....  Roasted pumpkin soup recipe  • 1.5kg edible pumpkin • Olive oil • 1 teaspoon dried chilli • 1 tablespoon coriander seeds • 1 large onion • 3 cloves garlic • 1 carrot • 1 stick of celery • 1 litre hot vegetable stock  Preheat the oven to 170°C/340°F. Half the pumpkin and remove the seeds (you can keep these for roasting), then chop into wedges. Place the pumpkin on two large baking trays and drizzle over a little olive oil. In a pestle and mortar, grind the chilli and coriander seeds with a pinch of salt until finely ground. Sprinkle the spices over the pumpkin with some black pepper. Roast the pumpkin for 1 hour, or until soft and slightly caramalised at the edges.  Meanwhile, roughly chop the onion, garlic, carrot and celery. Heat a lug of olive oil over a medium heat in a large saucepan then add the vegetables and cook for 15 minutes, or until soft and sweet but not coloured.  When the squash is ready, add to the pan with the hot stock. Blend with a stick blender, adding a little more water if you like a thinner consistency. 
8088	1	a	It's like Elder Scrolls Online, Fallout and Mad Max had a threesome.
5602	0	a	when youre playing this game and your grandpa says what the ♥♥♥♥ is that it means its ♥♥♥♥
5603	0	a	Yet another generic free game. No pros no cons.
8090	1	a	You play as a clone!!!!
8092	1	a	Had an amazing time in this game, hanging out with a clan and roleplaying with them. Some extremely friendly people in this game, atleast, I've only experienced friendly ones. Its, probably a little bit p2w, havent played in several years, but meh. I highly reccomend this, BUT bring a friend along!
8094	1	a	Great game, deep crafting system, great open world. interesting pvp and game elements, doing drive bys from my horse in the first 20 minutes of play really sold it to me, everything in the game is true to the post apocalyptic world, and does a lot to make the game immersive in a way, it has a ton of customization and an ability for everything, you can even tame wild animals, the intro and learning curve are a bit rough around the edges but I really had fun with this one and would gladly come back to it.
5604	0	a	the mod in this game silenced me from talking in caps. terrible communtiy and terrible graphics make up for a game that has probably the worst mechanics i have ever faced. this game makes infestation survivor stories look like a masterpiece. seriously. do not play this game.
5605	0	a	fallen earth is basically a free version of fallout. except multiplayer. the graphics in this game are, well there decent for a free game. the combat in the game though is pretty lame. it gets boring after a little bit. i give it a 5/10
5606	0	a	doesn't work the login doesn't work for me
5607	0	a	I like the concept of an open world post-apocalyptic MMORPG and the game was pretty good and fun for a free one initially. However, after a while, the game gets filled with random glitches and becomes boring after a while when you try to grind levels. Get this game if you have the patience to learn the jargon and complexity of the game. If not, don't expect anything much.
5608	0	a	This clunky clumsy game is full of graphical errors such as floating grass, movement errors, and combat errors. It's a shame it has such a good premise; Being an online multiplayer Fallout (Even takes place in the Mojave). But it doesnt control nice, it doesn't look nice. Neat theme, but gameplay looks like it was made on Alice game maker.
5609	0	a	Error cannot write comment  Error cannot connect to server  Error etc
5610	0	a	stupid as ♥♥♥♥in been downloading update for 2 hours ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥

5612	0	a	Will not download updates. I try to download the updates to play it and they stop at like 2 percent and wont go farther. 
8096	1	a	this game is a post apoctalyptic MMO it is turnbased in melee combat but it is very subtle so you can enjoy it if you dont like turn based and shooting is awsome play it like right now or i will find where you live and..... probably cry and ask 'why why didnt you play the gaaaaaame'!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5614	0	a	Most fun moment I had was when I got into an argument with some guy in the help channel about something stupid. All of the white knights showed up to inform me that I was breaking the rules by talking in help, but wait!!! Plot twist!!! They were breaking the rules by telling me I was breaking the rules!  Then I got bored and uninstalled.  4/10 would troll chat again.
5615	0	a	Fallen Earth is a okay mmo but when I say okay im saying it isn't a flop like warz. But it has what a mmo needs. But it does not have anything special about it. Its trying to be a Fall out 3 Online but it fails at doing that. Yes there guns and outfits at the store, which also the store is very confusing, Npc's and a open world. Thats all there is though it brings nothing new to the table. There's crafting, weapons, outfits, enemys. There is no random event or boss battle no huge lore. The graphics are muddy and the AI is okay. The last hit system is bad and its hard to stay in a party. You dont care about other people, or the story. Enemy's at terrible at the start and are bad later to. But they throw hordes at you which feels like a grind. It may be better later on. But how long do you want to put yourself through that. I give it a 4 out a 10 a okay game.
5616	0	a	COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME AND HARD DRIVE SPACE!!!!!! This is one of those games that are completely unplayable. The animations are messed up. Audio, I dont even want to talk about. Everything is impossible to understand and when I understand something its just stupid nonesense, The combat system is one of the worst in history. I have no idea why I even spent more than an hour playing this piece of ♥♥♥♥.  EDIT: Btw you have to wait an hour for this to install after downloading and installing from steam.
8098	1	a	this game is bert 
5617	0	a	the game view is bad, didnt like the graphic style.
5618	0	a	I sucks
5619	0	a	its way to dark not even the britness hepled it #poo face 
8100	1	a	After having a little experience on this I can say that this is possibly the greatest Free to Play i've ever came across, the world is relatively big and the whole gameplay is intense!
8102	1	a	Hey, you cant hate the game too bad... They just tried to make what we have all been waiting for for years, Fallout 4... Now that its announced, this game is pretty pointless! :D still was pretty fun though
8104	1	a	This game took me a little bit to get used to, I am very glad I took the extra time and didnt just stop because now I really enjoy this game. I have put in a decent amount of hours into the game, and I have really become addicted to it. Great crafting set up, decent amount of story type missions for you to do, and actually a pretty friendly community. There are a few things that could really be worked on that I will mention but for the most part a great game.  I very much like the crafting, and sometimes find myself staying in the same shop crafting for hours. You could pretty much completely stay away from anything mission or town wise and be completely happy making yourself food to keep healed up, or use your wide range of healing abilities. You cant completely do that though, there are a few different items that you can not craft, that you would have to get lucky on a drop with or buy from a merchant. From what I have seen you dont get chips(credits) from loot drops though, it seems to come from missions or selling your drops.  The two things that I have noticed that needs improvement are the enemy AI, you can almost walk five feet away from them and have them not notice you at all. The other thing is some of the vagueness on missions. There is not a lot of detial with some of the missions, some of them you really do need to just figure out on your own or ask the help channel for any input.  All and all, I do very much like this game and see myself playing for awhile.  
5621	0	a	Something is not quite right. I played first time - about 3 hours, though the Steam clock says only 15 minutes. When I went back for more, it required 'Run as Administrator' again for no good reason that I could find. Nice game in many ways, looks like it might 'grow' on you. However, requiring 'Run as Administrator' just isn't in my fan book.
8106	1	a	Axe? that should be stronger and hiting something with a 2x4? nope 2x4&gt;axe
8108	1	a	Lovely. Love the gambling. I kept borrowing money from my friend and now I'm in quite a debt.
5631	0	a	Does not work i dont know why im so annoyed dont play its frustrating to download and even more frustrating to sign up 
5632	0	a	this game is ♥♥♥♥. its very hard to control, alot of bugs and glitches and not fun since u have to follow a exact story line
5633	0	a	This game just flat out sucks. Barely ever come in contact with anyone, and the combat is HORRIBLE. I would not recommend getting this game.
5634	0	a	I hated it the combat mechanics were wonky and just plain crappy. The looting system was buggy and the weapons had hardly any good detail to them. Would not recomend this game.
5635	0	a	i actually cant play, i try 'steam authentification' but it doesnt work, so i sign up with me email, create a password and everything, guess what! IT DOESNT WORK
8110	1	a	A game that promised a very sandbox like experience, but was eventually altered to suit theme park players. A very immersive world with amazing feel to it. One of the most immersive games I've played. Try it yourself, but I think it's no longer the game it could have been. But, and this is important, do NOT listen to Bro Team's review. They're idiots with no grasp on how to approach games. I think I lost half of my brain cells just listening to their review which is basically devoid of any substance.   I recommend this if you like a Fallout/Western world with multiplayer elements
8112	1	a	This is a fun game to spend some of your time get your friends in and duble the fun
8114	1	a	Most people will say allmost right off the bat....THIS FOOKING SUCKS! but if you stay, and play it, you will like it. coming from me the huge Fallout fan/anything apocolyptic, this suits me and if your a fan of such things, then you will aswell. it takes a second to get use to the controls being quite odd, and also if your use to the WoW LOTRO SWTOR kind of mmo play, then all i can say is, close the book and start writing a new one cause this game plays FAR from orthadox MMO style game play. When i played this (you may not get this) i felt like i was playing a regular game, not an mmo, but an open world game such as Fallout and TES(the elder scrolls) games. one thing is, the people whom play this game are quite....rude if i should dare say so myself, trying to get a simple item takes a big long 'Well what will you do for me' and saying something in the wrong chat will actually take away your typing/chatting privlages, yes...they litterally put you in time out where you cant talk, its fooking stupid. ok so say you go in the HELP channel, which is the default chat, if your f2p you have no other chat that is global unless you pay, and this makes it hard to get it out there. But say you mess up, some Chat Nazi (THERE A FRIKEN LOT AND IT PISSES ME THE F*** OFF!) whom try to suck up to the GMs (game masters) because player can be made consumer gms, and they tell on you like you just broke your moms vase, its a little much so just saying watch out for that bs. One thing, love combat cause it isnt casual MMO press 1,2,3 repeat, let cooldown, 1,2,3, no you actually fight with left right mouse button with rifles,pistols, and melee weapons. Craftings a ♥♥♥♥♥, and mounts get cool its just they are so expensive you will loose your mind making one or buying one, getting craft skills up makes you want to uninstall the game, glitches happen alot, mobs teleport to you. theres sopost to be a stealth system (crouch/prone) but it dosent work in the slightest. quest have no heart to them, you play them basically for xp, for there is no good lore or story to follow (in my opinion), gear is great, you dont have to change for like ever (5 levels +) but one thing is i found myself playing alone alot because people take this game far to serious and act like the world actually ended and try to have everything for themselves which sucks. I give this game a 6/10 but yes i say you should try it if your into it, P.S quest are very far apart so prepare to hike =)
8116	1	a	it is amazing never played it  
5641	0	a	This game gave me parkinsons in my eyeballs.

8122	1	a	Cool but i do belive that nonmebers should get some form of a dune buggy at very low level just because its fair :3
5644	0	a	crashes on loading screen. i have the specs. game got the bugs.
5645	0	a	Weird movement mechanics
5646	0	a	This game crashed every time I ran it and still had bugs and when I got past the crash part it crashed aagin.... Horrible game.
5647	0	a	i would rather ram my ♥♥♥♥♥ through a plane engine than ever install this again
5648	0	a	boring as ♥♥♥♥
5649	0	a	The control system ♥♥♥♥ing sucks. I couldn't enjoy it.
5650	0	a	tbh i joined this game not knowing what the hell to expect because there wasnt much to see at the main screen. it looked like a fun game i gues but then you get into the game and its confusing as hell and you dont know what the ♥♥♥♥ you do. the tutorial doesnt do much its pretty bad. dont waste your time waiting for it to download and dont create an account.
8124	1	a	this pretty boring game some stupid story too but luckely this is free game!
8126	1	a	To anyone who enjoys a gritty post-apocalyptic world with a detailed crafting system, yet doesn't mind a slightly clunky, aging interface - I would suggest they at least give it a few hours.
8128	1	a	why is everyone complain about the wait it took like 10 min for me 
5659	0	a	I hated it the combat mechanics were wonky and just plain crappy. The looting system was buggy and the weapons had hardly any good detail to them. Would not recomend this game.
5660	0	a	I asked my friend 'What should i craft?' And he said 'You should craft your own ♥♥♥♥.' Then i died respawned and got awarded a horse...   9.99/10 would ♥♥♥♥ again
8130	1	a	I haven't been playing this game since 14/01/14 and I cannot play it right now or anymore until my old Windows laptop is repaired or acquire a new one strictly for gaming and otherwise. Fallen Earth was a game I truly sucked at and that is only because I was a kid who didn't understand half of the stuff I had to do other than save my body or something in the game. My laptop overheated too and that's because I sucked at managing the settings but now I'd be better with it. I found difficulty navigating my way back to the first safe-zone/bunker/thing that I started off in if I'm honest and I wanted to fight a giant worm instead of the piarries (I think I spelt it right?) The chicken mutated dog things. And the dogs. ...The chickens killed me a lot.  Enough with the ongoing shizzle about my personal experience lemme just get some of the good and bad out there.  The good: I found the immersive free-roam environment to be very fun, the many different weapons, the original (I think all were) enemies you could combat and the mounts/vehicles you could utilise in the wasteland. It felt very Fallout to me and I would totally understand if everyone else felt the same way as well about it at first. It's a good post-apocalyptic MMORPG that I'd play again if I could.   The bad: there isn't a lot here. I found that the inability to customise your facial features like a very decent MMORPG game to be extremely disappointing. I'd have liked to given my protagonist a unique appearance rather than settling with him/her looking exactly as everyone else (keep in mind I haven't played for a long time). I found it irritable, how easy ammo can be expelled from your inventory, but even moreso when trying to re-acquire it. Searching around the Grand Canyon's wasteland I couldn't find anything even when 'killing' enemies (I never encountered any human enemies during my time I think). The high prices for moderately good gear was a pain too, do they have to be so high? This is me complaining here a little.  Overall I think it was a good game regardless and I'd play it again if I could just to see for myself how far it has fallen in grace. I recommend it if you're really tolerable and experienced with MMORPG's.
8132	1	a	The personal development of your character is very deep, many, good skilltrees and fun combat.
8134	1	a	A Great Game, Fallout but a good mmo with loads to do. Its so easy to get lost in this game so remember to read quest objectives carefully some are eaiser than others.
5664	0	a	Literally Only Played Because I Was Out Of Money Awful Story 0/10

5669	0	a	Buy Fallout 4 instead.
5670	0	a	started out average, then I went to craft something and just had to wait for a timer to run down, over a minute for first skill bandage, so uninstalled, that's just dull!
5671	0	a	This game is broken
5672	0	a	apparently this used to be enjoyable. but at this point its just pay to win.
5673	0	a	This game is pretty much Trash. Get it if you're in the need to find motivation to do something better with your life, than this dev team did with theirs.
8136	1	a	As a recovered *twitch* addict of a different MMORPG, it's nice to slip in to another game that holds my attention. Granted, I have only been playing this one for about three weeks, but I do find myself drawn back in to play another day....and another day.  Now, as I have only been playing for three weeks, it's difficult for me to give an indepth review of the game, but I would recommend giving it a try! It seems to be a highly open-ended game in progression. Sure there's a plot, but you are able to take/deny quests as you see fit. Don't want to do x,y, or z....fine...move on.  Try dabbling in this and that.  Besides...it's a free download. Try it...there's nothing to lose!
8138	1	a	After having a little experience on this I can say that this is possibly the greatest Free to Play i've ever came across, the world is relatively big and the whole gameplay is intense!

5687	0	a	Worst game I've tried to download on steam by far.
5688	0	a	Ancient game. Horrible game company. Devs/GMs are actively the biggest jerks in the game.  So much better games out there.
5689	0	a	I sucks
8150	1	a	Ok so the graphics are meh and outdated, and the mechanics suck too. But it has a great atmosphere and it just has that special fallout-like feel.
8152	1	a	awesome game leveling may take awhile but you developing a character not just blasting through this game 
8154	1	a	Mad Max but with drugs and more violence... I'm a druged up one eyed pirate cowboy
8156	1	a	Truthfully. The game is alright. But slowly dying... Fun game, dated graphics, ingame purchases. Barley any Micro-transactions. 7/10
8158	1	a	i think its perety col its awsome some peps should come try it out 
5694	0	a	Dumb game has bad graphics, actually didn't mind the ok combat and art style, the little story I read was not interesting enough to engage me, and I couldn't pass this one door in the tutorial because I for some odd reason able to destroy the only key to open the door so I couldn't even play past the first like hour.
5695	0	a	This game sucks. I can't even play it because my 'new' account won't work.
5696	0	a	♥♥♥♥ game don't try to play it its like combat ars ♥♥♥♥ this ♥♥♥♥ omg !
5697	0	a	game wouldn't load  -100/♥♥♥♥ game
8160	1	a	Where to start? First, the storyline, loved it! And I love the PvE as well as the PvP. I'm just glad it's not like DayZ where you can be killed at anytime, it would just ruin it for me. The fighting can get a bit weary at times, what with the same animations used over and over, but this is a 2008 game, and it lives up to the 2008 standards. Crafting: To craft is an art, you have to level your stats in order to craft different things if you don't want to spend your chips on it. It takes time, and I think that's a great factor in the 'realism' if I can even use the word. I'm hooked on this game! Everyday I will get on, sometimes just for a few minutes to finish up that ONE quest. I can't stop! You know, some people say the controls are dumb, but I just sit back and think 'Well maybe if you had a brain, you could understand them better, it's not all sunshine and cupcakes dude.' So all in all do I recommend this game? Heck yeah.
8162	1	a	I had this on my old computer, and have always played it F2P. I don't really have a lot of complaints about it other than the crafting, even low-level stuff, can be insanely time-consuming. Everything else is fine, but just the crafting time alone has turned me off to the game more or less, as I currently don't have it installed on my new computer but am considering reinstalling it. It's just really hard to progress at any rate if you don't pour money and constant 24/7 game time into it. But overall it's a pretty decent game. If you don't mind the crafting times (which I personally do), then I'd recommend the game.
8164	1	a	i joined the game 1 month ago and wasnt really into it.but i only got into level 10 so i feel like a left it to soon so am rejoining :D  
8166	1	a	Its just awesome.
8168	1	a	Like Fallout yet multiplayer and free.
8170	1	a	reach lvl 8....have atv...life's good
8172	1	a	Its good. But I am lacking endurance to progress in the game.
5699	0	a	20 minutes spent trying to play this game - after an hour for it to download. I still didn't actually get to play it. 20 minutes of 'data collecting', registration, validations, updates, file checks etc. Then no play button at the end of it all. No clear indication that all that song and dance was worth it. Not impressed.
5700	0	a	I tried to get into this game but man oh man does it have a steep learning curve. No guide as to how to begin. Also, not the prettiest thing.
8174	1	a	I've been playing this game for a lot of time, more time than i could think of playing a game now i restarted on steam after maybe one year and it still feels as good as before, its maybe the most underrated game or at least mmorpg ever, the world is huge, you can scavenge/harvest in most places of the world map so that you can even spend hours driving your madmax-like buggy through the wasteland scavenging for different ressources that others would buy for a lot of chips (money) at the Auction House and its also easy to make yourself rich if your smart and not lazy, factions also bring a lot of fun you can capture different zones for your faction, you have arch enemies, ally factions and there are 6 factions in total each being very unique. To all who say this game is p2w, its not like those people say that you have to pay monthly to enjoy this game, if you pay 5 bucks all of the limitations will be gone and you get a nice starter pack, no need to buy anything and can go straight for the end level without limits, its really worth it !
5702	0	a	WTF is this game?
5703	0	a	I like Fallen Earth but cannot recommend it.  The game is PvP centric, especially at the end game, but there is only one viable build for PvP (smallest female with pistols).  Unfortunately, the end game is dead with little or nothing to do and very  few people online.  Playing free until you reach the level cap can be fun if you enjoy exploration, crafting, harvesting but once you reach the level cap there is little left.  Be warned: all weapons and armors are crafted, there is almost nothing  available from vendors or missions so if you don't want to train skills and  craft your own stuff this game will not be fun for you.  
8176	1	a	Nothing fancy, just a decent game...
5709	0	a	Wasted 30 minutes of my life playing this game. Bad sound effects bad controls bad graphics bad gameplay.
8178	1	a	Fallen Earth is an extremely clever game! It's mechanics are well defined, and thankfully free to play. It follows a traditional MMO pattern, but with it's own defining characteristic. A FPS or thirdps mechanic that works fantastic! Any MMO fan will feel at home here. It's crafting system is amazing, but if you are the kind of person who loves crafting, you might end up spending a lot of game time gathering the materials you need to build in game objects. PVP is good. Unfortunately there was only one game type that was generously populated, the rest having either zero or a handfull of players wanting to play it.   Since it's free, there's nothing wrong with checking it out! Be wery, the game glitched on a ATI Radeon 4300.

5714	0	a	How do I login? I registered but do I put my email in the Username box?
5715	0	a	For some odd reason you have to go through a stupid login process that doesn't even work right in order to actually play the game.  I Do not recommend this game. You would be better off playing a game like Dayz. 
8180	1	a	Well wht can i say other than wow! ( no not world of warcraft ffs)   This game tests ur patience with some good old grinding, no not boring (NOTICE ''I SAID GOOD OLD GRINDING'') stop being negative already geez xD  So where was I... Oh yes! if u hav a brain and like sum crafting and sum action this game is soooooo what u need, if u have half a brain just pass coz this here is not for dumb people, ull hav loads of fun and the learning curve is easy and if ur really stuck u hav an online GM help line too :) which is helpful but dont go every 5secs n ask the same stupid SH*T coz ull get a full blast go play the game and figure it out a lil from a GM xD ( i totally agree with )  So u dont ask to be the best u learn to be the best thts final, the game is ruthless and nicely planned out, dnt go and expect to just get a vehicle lol u gta build 1 which is epic too coz hey the world is busted so scavenge get stuff and start with sum tyres and a frame etc etc ull hav the full reward of it in a good couple of hours :) so the crafting system is most awesome :)   Yes there is a few bugs etc but hey u ever played a bug free game that aint on console......? my point exactly  so give the game a whirl ull love it  8/10
8182	1	a	YOU SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSUUUUUUUUUUUUCCCCCCCCCCCCKKKKKKKKKKKK! NIGHTMARE!
5718	0	a	very glitchy
8184	1	a	A excellent MMO if you have some patience I have been playing FE since it was subscription based and still find new and interesting things to do in game. The crafting system is the best of any MMO I have played and actualy plays a large role for the in game economy. The sheer amount of land to explore will leave you breathless and you actualy need a horse or vehicle to get around unless you want to take hours running on foot.
8186	1	a	this game ran like ♥♥♥♥ on my old computer its graphics are not the best but i should run on my pc which btw cant run dirty bomb so if you like a good mmo without killing players also known as the best part of day Z and instead a good story you get this game and btw you might not need the super graphic card to run this game like a boos 
8188	1	a	It's like Elder Scrolls Online, Fallout and Mad Max had a threesome.
8190	1	a	9/10  I actually love this game, although there are frustrating things about it...
8192	1	a	People who ar reviewing this game with playtime under 10 hrs suck anyways.. You are still a noob in this game after 100 hrs. Even i after way over 1000 hrs playtime havent seen every corner of the really HUGE maps.   It has a lot stuff that it does right and stuff that it does wrong . Like all Games it has PROS and CONS ! ..However, looking at the overall perspective its a good free to play title. If you invest 5 or 10 Dollars even more so.   Yes the people here are right about the old and outdated gameplay. The graphics and the lack of end content.  But it has a lot of other cool features you cant find in todays games anymore.   Like a really complex crafting system or player housing or compass navigation. For Western and Apocalypse fans its a great game to play for many many hours. But only for a patient player who likes pve over pvp.   I ve done a lot in this game and still come back very once in a while just to enjoy a few desert sunsets or check back with the community which is one of the best ive found out there in MMOs.   At first i hated the game and stopped playing it. But then i gave it a second chance and it was quite FUN.   Try it or dont.. your decision .. ^^
8194	1	a	im more of a console player but i actually like this game it's not bad i mean its not the best but its not the worst game ever so in my opinion it's a ok game
8196	1	a	Best game I ever played ;D
8198	1	a	Like on other guy said. Clans need to be able to build their own base as they want. Its an post apocaliptic game. Having the ability to build a home in a ruinned place would be awesome other than that its a bit boring
5724	0	a	COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME AND HARD DRIVE SPACE!!!!!! This is one of those games that are completely unplayable. The animations are messed up. Audio, I dont even want to talk about. Everything is impossible to understand and when I understand something its just stupid nonesense, The combat system is one of the worst in history. I have no idea why I even spent more than an hour playing this piece of ♥♥♥♥.  EDIT: Btw you have to wait an hour for this to install after downloading and installing from steam.
8200	1	a	Its good. But I am lacking endurance to progress in the game.
5726	0	a	20 minutes spent trying to play this game - after an hour for it to download. I still didn't actually get to play it. 20 minutes of 'data collecting', registration, validations, updates, file checks etc. Then no play button at the end of it all. No clear indication that all that song and dance was worth it. Not impressed.
8202	1	a	its god game but i hate when i kill someone he spawns after 20 seconds
8204	1	a	A MMORPGFPS only for the people who like the Post-Apocalyptic setting, It's really good for roleplaying however it is Newbie unfriendly by throwing you into a world without much of an explanation. We can argue this is appropriate for the ''roleplaying'' ''realistic'' feel of the game.  Overall an Awesome game!
8206	1	a	It has Paintball guns. 10/10
8208	1	a	10/10 needs more bear
8210	1	a	i played it one time, forgot all the controls, now im sad.
5729	0	a	not a fan 
5730	0	a	this is the worst i have ever played. it is an uninspired pile of horse ♥♥♥♥ rip off of fallout with friends. for the 1 and a half hours i played it i did grinding and fetch quest. that is the extent. and its the same model for all bandits.   Basically, do NOT play this game
8212	1	a	Very good game ! nice graphics for a free game. :)
8214	1	a	Reminds me of Mad Max: Beyond Thunder Dome
8216	1	a	Great MMO, wish there weren't better ones out there like NWN or SWTOR But, for end of the world apocolypse MMO, this is still the best that I've seen. 
8218	1	a	A truly ambitious recreation of the Fallout series in MMO format minus any talent whatsoever.
8220	1	a	Kinda cool except for the repetition of the enemies they look the same over and over off the sides of the roads  A bit complicated and involved which is not necessarily a bad thing.
8222	1	a	I liked this game alot it definately can submerge you in quests and loot farming, searching for parts.
8224	1	a	IT WAS AWESOME ALMOST AS AWESOME AS THE 4 DAY DOWNLOAD!!!
8226	1	a	this game is an epic adventure/survival game that will eliminate all other free to play games on steam. most defanantly worth getting it. Especialy because its a free to play game.
5734	0	a	I mean, if you want to spend $100+ on a game instead of something useful in life; then SURE go ahead and play this game. I mean, who doesn't like shoddy grsphics, a horrible community, and horrible controls...then yes if you want to pay $100+ just to SURVIVE for a little while in this game...go right ahead...
5735	0	a	Started up. Made character. Started game. Moved into next room with the framerate chugging. Attempted to punch a dude. Framerate was about 3 per minute. Game crashed. Uninstalled.
8228	1	a	No controller support, as much as I want to play &amp; like this, I haven't played it.
5737	0	a	Don't play this game unless you are under an enormous amount of substances
5738	0	a	GM's in this game when I played gave me a bad vibe on how they handle chat. Other then that the game is fun for me up to level 20 or so. Did not care for the PVP here, but liked going around finding items to use for crafting. I think they should have stuck to this direction more and add housing and land claims for guilds. Then use guilds as a way to pvp instead of how they did it. Make it feel like Clan wars that you would see in real life. Fighting for land and resources.  PS: I played this game before it was out on Steam

8230	1	a	not too bad after all
8232	1	a	Very good game ! nice graphics for a free game. :)
5745	0	a	Game idea isn't to bad but the community is horrible, devs broke the combat system, the in game GM's need to be changed out.
8234	1	a	Well now.. what to do with filled vaults?
8236	1	a	Great MMO, wish there weren't better ones out there like NWN or SWTOR But, for end of the world apocolypse MMO, this is still the best that I've seen. 
5746	0	a	It's not a Good game.
5747	0	a	Idea : 9/10  Graphics : 2/10  Engine : 2/10  Overlay : 2/10  Controls : 1/10   Metascore : 1/10   In a Nutshell : I bet 10 Bucks the support for this game ends in 2015 ( latest ) . The graphics are horrible, the engine and controls are poor and unsatisfying and the world is so ugly designed; Really a bad game.   Try for yourself and download and install for free. I say its poop.  However the idea is great.  Fallout 4 Multiplayer pls :-)
5748	0	a	worst game i have ever played.
8238	1	a	Cool!
8240	1	a	Tah survivors WILL DIE
5750	0	a	DO NOT.... DOWNLOAD... THIS GAME!!!!!  It is quite a buggy, fustrating mess of a game that is trying to be fallout but with mmo but fails because while fallout was more an experience with a narrative, fallen earth is just quests with little unique background interaction, i ran around the world for 2 hours and the only out of quest experience i had was finding a glitch that made me go though a tree and end up on top of it. if it wasnt abit too big to play for the lols i would say, play it for the lols but dont even try.
8242	1	a	you can go to the bar and waste all your chips on booze and gambling  11/10 would become an alcoholic gambling addict again
5753	0	a	Had To Sign Into Like 50 New Things Just For It To Start Working.   1/10 Not Worth The Effort
5754	0	a	I used to LOVE this game,but now it is boring.The game has actually tooken a step back,ever since I realized no improvements.At first,I thought 'Oh my god this is fun.' ~1 year later~ 'Wow,just,wow,this game turned boring real quick after I came back.' ~5 days later~ O_O 'There is no way this game hasn't improved after a long time,IT HAS GREAT POTENTIAL!!!' But nooooo,the new company gamersfirst turned into gamerslast! Sorry,I have to go from this sad review I never thought I would write. *Goes to another room to cry* &gt;;(
5755	0	a	This game could of been huge if it wanted to...But instead, we get another lame MMO in our mist on Steam congrats!   Anyway the reason why I am saying no to this game is well, let's be honest...It's A peice of crap to be shared around with your friends and they get just as much crap as you do...   It's just the same old MMo's looking for money like A hobbo, but A very smartish hobbo... Half of my gaming time was basicly trying to get the ♥♥♥♥ing game to even work! xD 3 hours because the updater was being A peice of Suger.Honey.Ice.Tea... After A month crying in the corner playing games that are actaully good? I tried updating it again, because I can...   IT WORKED!!! :D   I looked at most of the reviews of this game but I just wanted to check for myself to see if I would like this game because some players do... I was backfired...   It seem to start out good (Create A character, give him A afro, stuff like that...) But I had it coming and I seem to always find this in most MMO games, it is basicly like Face of Mankind, but it is older and when I think of it, FoM ideas come from this game but just gave it A new damn story...ish   The start was like every godamn MMO, have these damn NPC's giving me A random ♥♥♥♥♥♥ quest, why can't at least 1 game just let you free instead of trapping you with NPC's that will keep you in the game for eternity until you finnish all of what they damn well givien you.   Secondly the Graphics... S.H.I.T   Why? because for some odd reason, when I get into A huge damn firefight... I start to lose all my damn FPS and this is only on Low graphics settings (Because my computer is crap...) But I should be able to fight without losing all my danm framerate but no... I just do...   It's nice to know writing this review 2.00am in the morning to just say how bad is this game because right now, I am just wasting my life not even playing the game because I am stuck here writing this review of how crappy it is...   0.5/10 Cookies... Only because I was able to give my guy an afro and make him black ;-;   EDIT: Please note, I was 'probably'... Kind of drunk when I made this. XD So ummm... If you enjoy my distorted, skillfullishness of writing this review? Give A Thumbs Up. BECAUSE WHY NOT!!!   It's right there...   Probably... XD
5756	0	a	This game is terrible, don't bother downloading it, its a ♥♥♥♥ing puzzle to download and the actual game itself is bad. not to mention the fact that when you want to get rid of it it take years to uninstall. DO NOT GET THIS
5757	0	a	Downloaded the game on steam fast &amp; nicely. After launched game 'Steam login' didin't work so i created new account. Then the game started to patch 130MB (I have 100/5M connection) with estimated time of +2hours. Their upload servers seems to lack upload speed since it downloaded like +- 69KB/s.  Cannot really review the game, but the upload server seems the be either slow for now or just totally messed.  0/5 because couldn't play the game due upload servers.
5758	0	a	pay 2 win. once Gamers first took it over it was destroyed which is sadly why i dont play it anymore.
5759	0	a	the uninstall button works great that is if your stupid enough to install it in the first place damn i was, what rubbish. its a super cheap version of dayz super super cheap even morrowind has a better combat system ,hack,slash,chop. wouldnt even waste your gig gettin this .
5760	0	a	this game has its limits. I can see people liking it for its roleplay features but i thought it would need some sandbox. Like adding clans that can make there bases and save them so they have somewhere to stay. Then it would be a game worth playing
5761	0	a	This Game is 4 years old and yet doesnt seem to have polished off all of its better features.
8244	1	a	Enjoyable for a while, then generic and repedative mmo grind. Still good if your into the post apocalyptic theme.
5768	0	a	Controls sucked, nothing ineresting happened outside of about 5 minutes of escaping some facility. UI was crap. The game looks like it was made with a bunch of store-bought assets. Horrible, horrible game. It just makes me wish I was playing Fallout.
5769	0	a	Great Art and Horrible Game Mechanics...!?!...
8246	1	a	A mixture of Fallout and The Last of Us.
5770	0	a	graphics and animation are bad or too old...
8248	1	a	  good gonna play more now bye
5773	0	a	You can't even set the controls the way you want, can't use my mouse button to move forward, we are ano 2014 realy ?  Deleted asap .  Fix this and i wil give it a try.
5774	0	a	crappy game
5775	0	a	Here's my thoughts:  Ahem... FIX YOUR ♥♥♥♥!  Honestly, I love the idea of the game. Great idea, I'd duplicate the idea myself! The execution of the idea is TERRIBLE!  Want fetch quests? Play this game, it's nothing but. And yes, I'm aware that I only have .2 hours played. I'm already a level 5.   0/10 IGN- You know you ♥♥♥♥ed up.
5776	0	a	i spent an hour and a half downloading the game, then i made an account, verified it.. and of course theres an update to download before i can play, even though i JUST installed the game... THEN the update takes forever to get to the actual download portion, and although its a meager 150mb download, its been 5 minutes, and it says i've downloaded 1kb and my estimated wait for it finish is 1000 days. so f**k that
5777	0	a	Perhaps it would be a good game if the login would actually work. Not recomended.
8250	1	a	was quite fun until i got stuck trying to get the quad
8252	1	a	i fell on the earth
8254	1	a	Very good game! And easy to play even for begingers! I totaly recommend this game!
5783	0	a	so ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥ it wont let me ♥♥♥♥ing login i have tried it over and over after going to the link on my email this is so ♥♥♥♥♥♥ im so ♥♥♥♥♥♥ it looked so cool but ♥♥♥♥ you guys have fun sucking the ♥♥♥♥♥ that your being chocked with DELETED!!!
5784	0	a	Do not waste your time in this garbage. For your sake, try other games.
8256	1	a	Well i love Disgaea. But... This game is the same as Disgaea: Hour of Darkness for playstation 2 Release date January 30, 2003. so being as they took off Hour of Darkness and put PC i want a refund as its not a new game and they should of simply called it a remake. This falls under false advertisement imo.  As of 1:02am 02/25/16 Steam: We have reviewed your refund request. We are unable to refund this purchase to your Steam Wallet at this time. Your playtime of an included product exceeds 2 hours (our refund policy maximum).  This should not matter as i paid for Disgaea PC ( a new game or so i thought)  I dont want Disgaea Hour of Darkness as i already own it for console.  I hope this saves someone else the 19.99  You can prob get this game online for playstation 2 for around 5.00
8258	1	a	its ok but the graphics are not this gen mmre like original x box graphics
5793	0	a	Fallout is awesome! Oh, wait this isn't Fallout? Oh yeah it's 'Fallen Earth' don't buy that ♥♥♥♥.
5794	0	a	Actually this game is not in steam at all... you have to create a gamersfirst account and the updater trends to hijack your connection while updating, if you really like to play this don't download it here, go directly to gamersfirst and download the client manually
8260	1	a	steam authentication box goes away  cant play game anymore,lost all ♥♥♥♥  this game sucks 12/10
5797	0	a	guys make who ever made it please make it so we can just log in with our steam accounts because so many people HATE it because of that
5798	0	a	dont recommend it the fact that you need to PROVE that you are you that you need to login with steam AGAIN is just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. i would love if i could just get in the game and play without the super security.
5799	0	a	this game sucks
5800	0	a	Missing background.
5801	0	a	What a waste of time
5802	0	a	This Game Sucks It Barely Runs On My Lap Top When I Record I Don't Recommend It At All
5803	0	a	Can't turn while jumping.
5804	0	a	looks like a copy of fallout
5805	0	a	I would suggest that you avoid this game and use your time playing something better. Main reason, bugs and poor support. Other reason, quickly respawning NPC enemies make this game frustrating when you're trying to achieve or finish mission, or simply clear the area of enemies so you can exploit resources or explore the area.  Mainly, I decided not to play it anymore, because support on server was soo bad, that lag effected mission completion. For example, you have to complete part of mission (kill some NPC) to progress through that mission. Mission was time limited. Anyhow, I kill that NPC, but game does not recognise that part one was done, so I lose mission on time. Hence, lag of some 30 minutes and more that server did not register that I completed part of mission.   Time is scarce, and this is not game on which I want to use that precious resource :D  Oh, yes, good luck with registration and login process. It's absolute nightmare, check forums on that topic, before enrolling.
5806	0	a	Sux Bhals, Game does nothing but update. When clickon any part of display it shuts down. Waited hours for update and nothing. REALLY bad ....
8262	1	a	steam authentication box goes away  cant play game anymore,lost all ♥♥♥♥  this game sucks 12/10

5814	0	a	This game makes me want to take a 9mm bullet to the forehead
5815	0	a	I spent half a hour trying to make a account. When I made a account for the website, I could not access the Fallen Earth page. It had locked me out. I could not get to my username to play the game. Since my account has already been created, I cannot create a new one.  2/10 Looks like a good game, but I could never play it
5816	0	a	This is gonna be short and sweet.  This is a WoW clone. It is a third-person, ability based MMO.  It is not what I wanted nor expected.  If you are looking for something different, keep looking.
5817	0	a	♥♥♥ bad mmo outdated as ♥♥♥
8266	1	a	I played this game and it was good but with no story it was kinda confusing on what to do at low levels.
5818	0	a	The reason I have so many hours is because it'd install the same update every time I launched it, and I accidentially left it open all weekend. If I remember correctly, the gameplay was lackluster and bland.
8268	1	a	This game is a preety good game it has been a while since the last time i played it but it was a really good game but it takes a while of getting uset to, But dont expect to fall in love with the game right away you have to give the game a chance.

5826	0	a	Do not buy this game! not only is it full of bugs and charecter placement is sooo messed up. but pushing all that aside the main GM tiggs runs it with many hacker friends. Her and this group of hackers control the pvp of the game unfairly and any1 who catches on is banned permanetly. there was a petion to remove her for just apb alone where she is also the main gm over 168 signed just falling short of removing her.... do your self a favour and let this game die under its crappy management. also id like to note i played the game for 5 years before i found out tiggs was a crooked deceitful person had the privilage of talking via email after she banned me when i sent a video of one of her most famous hackers teleporting in mid battle...

5829	0	a	I tried it, liked all the crafting options. Server is too unstable. Half the time logging in to play I find: The server is restarting to resolve performance issues. ETA 11 PST, and this seems to take a minium of 2 hours, really?! Not to mention it always says the same ETA.
5830	0	a	Freemium trash game. You're not allowed to use the chat unless you pay. Can't do half the content unless you pay. Have a money cap unless you pay...  Unplayable unless you pay. 1/10, crappy freemium games that are money greedy. You will regret every minute invested, when a moderator bans you for chatting, or when you find out about the money cap / other p2w aspects, ♥♥♥♥ this ♥♥♥♥.
5831	0	a	Just wasted 44 minutes of my life creating a gamers first account and trying to log in to even see what this game is all about... Invalid user name and password. It never asked me to create a user name, it created its own jumble   G1-2af0f9eb-97da-45b2 LIKE ILL REMEMBER THAT!  still cant log in, so never got to see if this game was any good...  Im getting pretty old, so wasting 44 minutes could be the last fun I had before death... wasted  will update if I ever get login help from them *If I live long enough
8274	1	a	I played it. The guns had no sound. I stopped playing it.    10/10 It's okay.

5847	0	a	You have to do 80 diffrent steps just to PLAY TEH DAME GAME
5848	0	a	So after an hour and a half waiting for this game to download, i create an account, and the game straight away needs to update.  So i play the waiting game again, after 10 minutes, the launcher gets stuck on a loop of 'Collating Data' to 'Downloading Update' and back to 'Collating Data'.  Waste of time.
5849	0	a	Clunky and not particularly anything new to the genre. If it was smooth and properly made but nothing new, that's fine, but it doesn't have many interesting points to the game.
5850	0	a	cant verify email address as page isnt there. wasted download
5851	0	a	This game is beyond terribad. Clunky mechanics, bad UI, terrible mob placement, and a grindfest from the beginning (bad graphics goes without saying).
5852	0	a	IT AWFUL! 
8284	1	a	how do i even play wtf cant get past login screen mad a acoount but it asks for a username at launch i never was asked to make one and i tried my steam username please help
5854	0	a	BAD GAME SORRY BUT I MEAN TO LONG TO SETUP IT TOOK 14 HOURS TOTAL AND I HAVE GREAT COMPUTER AND THE MULTIPLAYER ISNT THAT GOOD 
5855	0	a	Horrible.
5856	0	a	Not much to say. Buggy, boring. Played with a friend for about two hours before we gave it up.   All in all I'd say this picture sums up the best part of the game:  {LINK REMOVED}  http://tinyurl.com/p5wj2jb   I want my two hours back. (Link is to t i n y u r l . c o m)
8286	1	a	looks good, have not tryed it out yet tho
8288	1	a	Never played game, writes review. 10/10 wouldent play again?
8290	1	a	havent played yet lol
8292	1	a	If you like both MMO RPGs and the fallout series I suggest you download this game!
5863	0	a	The main reason I do not recomend this game come from the fact that when I tried to boot it again after initally setting it up then quitting. The game refuses to load past saying, 'Loading World' and then the game stops responding
8294	1	a	My Only complaint was that there was no controller support... hope that can come into play and i will pick the game up again. Just feels like the kind of game for it being a shooter 
8296	1	a	This game is actually a very well-made game, The people who recently gave review to this game either has a horrible  PC or just can't stand a single second for minor bugs.  I've played this 2-3 years back and it was super fun. It may not have much players now, But its still the fun game i know and love,  I managed to make Soap Mactavish come to life in this game. Couldn't remember the username and password.. it was like 2-3 years ago, Can't blame me.  Either way, Its still a good game. It takes a special person to enjoy this wonderful piece of work. Everyone who disliked this most probably isn't a special kind and just throws in a bad review to make it look bad. Don't worry, This game will be revived sooner or later filled with players,   i'll come back here one day with a ton of players joining me. It only takes a few players to make this game big again, So i ask you.. are you up for the challenge?
5866	0	a	spent 2 hours trying to work out how to start the game, 10/10 still have not played it.
8298	1	a	Best MMORPG game you can get. It's Post-Apocalyptic (Like Fallout) and now it's free2play! You should definitely try out this game and recommend it to your friends. It has nice graphics for a MMORPG game, tons of weapons and armor, items, there is a huge crafting system in the game, there are vehicles... One of my favourite games and it's #1st on my list of my top favourite MMORPGs.  Overall: 10/10
5868	0	a	ok lets make this fast so any add doesnt block me :  Il say few things about this game ...  but before it just saying it couldve done better   so i said im gona say few things about this game and lets start  1) if u wanna play u must have a account right? but what happens if u cant create a account 2) it said wait 5-10 minutes i waited half a hour 3) i had a steam account and i needed to be logined with gamerfirst account  i would ♥♥♥♥♥ on this game more if i seed the gameplay
5869	0	a	It's ♥♥♥♥
5870	0	a	worst game ive ever played
5871	0	a	In my personal opinion this game is an out dated piece of poo, some people will disagree but I think this game should be deleated from existance :-} that is all
5872	0	a	super boaring game, i dont recommend playing it.
5873	0	a	the first time i see the game i was friking out because it has an open world and other good stuff but i register like 5 times in a row it dont let me play that sucks
5874	0	a	Everytime I play this I get the blue scren, is that normal?
5875	0	a	ehhh it's aight i wouldn't reccomend it, ♥♥♥♥ my ♥♥♥♥ing computer got a virus from this bull and forced my computer to downloads spam ♥♥♥♥, it's still not working correctly so ♥♥♥♥ it
8300	1	a	It's the cheap fallout.
8302	1	a	Got bludgeoned too death, gained flight  10/10 would be cloned again
5878	0	a	Feels Unfinished  Lack of strong Community  Economy felt Dead  Questing was repetitive and bland  Very Grindy.
5879	0	a	looks cool.. the pics/previews.. right? well, i finally got enough ingame denero($).. bought a cool looking knife.. a new hat,  hopped on some flea bitten horse and took off riding!.  DAY 2.. STILL riding .. ran outta sunlight. got attacked by some hairy mutt looking things..  anyways,  DAY 3.. still riding DAY 4.. trying to find a town, ANY TOWN! DAY .. uh, well, i lost track of the days. anyways,  hopped off my 3 legged horse.. then i STARTED jumping up and down.. and running.. stabbing my blade in the wind! hopping up and DOWN!  my character finally LOST IT! i havent been online with this game ever since.  the end

5881	0	a	Nice idea but clunky interface, weak combat and lack of anything interesting to do make it a quick uninstall
8304	1	a	is very cool game!!!!!!! BRO!!!!!!!!! 
5882	0	a	Right, so I was on this game for a minute and a half. It's a minute of a half of my life that I'll never get back. This game is complete ♥♥♥♥ and makes the N64 Superman game look like the best game ever created, don't waste your time with it.
5883	0	a	Not even going to bother with a full review- I played about 4 minutes total after the slew of unnecessarily spaced out updates. Character creation, 4/10.   Gameplay mechanic, 3/10. And where the hell was the sound?   Combat mechanic, 6/10  Overall: 4.9/10
5884	0	a	♥♥♥♥
5885	0	a	Becauzzzz the updater just repeatedly updating and analysing th data
8306	1	a	a low meh.
8308	1	a	The UI is unfinished, giving the game a beta feel, but they call it finished, which to me means that the devs are a being half hearted with the game, which is sad, but then again the game is free.
8310	1	a	If you like both MMO RPGs and the fallout series I suggest you download this game!
8312	1	a	Decent game. This game would honestly be harder to get into if it was not free. It's a little similar to Fallout but without all the weapons, storyline or anything phsyically in Fallout. It's a post - apocalyptic wasteland with more online people! The loot drops are fair to the person who kills said enemy, which is cool. I would recommend being patient with the updating system aswell because it takes its time! Other than that a pretty decent game.
8314	1	a	Not the best Zombie Apocalypse game I ever played, I expected it to be a bit more like DayZ, or 7 Days To Die. But this is a good game, I would reccomend it for those looking for a 3rd Person Zombie Shooter, I give this game a 7/10
5891	0	a	Right, so I was on this game for a minute and a half. It's a minute of a half of my life that I'll never get back. This game is complete ♥♥♥♥ and makes the N64 Superman game look like the best game ever created, don't waste your time with it.
8316	1	a	Must play, best game in the world. This game gets a 5/5 rating from me. It beats : -Skyrim -COD -Battlefield -Minecraft -Maplestory  Best game. You all must try it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
8318	1	a	PLAY THIS GAME WITH ME CAUSE I WILL GUIDE YOU TO PLAY LIKE A PRO
8320	1	a	this game is a mixture of awesomeness, and boringness while you have fun on your adventure of killing things you cant really do much more than trade and buy stuff. But if ur into this kind of stuff then this is the game for you. But if you are the type of person like me and love challenges then i suggest to you starbound it is the most amazing game its better than minecraft and terraria put together with it only being in beta
5897	0	a	1. Was interested in game, because apparently GamersFirst took it over and created some controversies. 2. People complained about P2W crap but I also noticed good reviews, even after the takeover. 3. Downloaded and created account. 4. Patcher opens and shows me this picture:  http://i.imgur.com/Kgw4D5b.png  5. I remember the gold sellers from other freemium crap MMORPGs. 6. I cancel the patching and uninstall the game.  10/10 would try out freemium crap again.
5898	0	a	Downloaded it because I saw so many good reviews. Was a bit dissapointed and I think the game is overrated.  Would've been decent 10 years ago, but now there are other, better games.
5899	0	a	It's just not aging well at all.
8322	1	a	if you can handle the PS2 era graphics and the odd lack of people, you will probibly enjoy this Fallout MMO. its definitly a better RPG then fallout 4 is .
8324	1	a	I put in over 100000 Hr and i can say that this game is so MLG PRofesicanl Dwat I Waidsted Awl Myw Money. Its so good that i can say i didnt want to kill my self 30 times in a day when forced to pay this for loosing a bet. Also the admins or so amazing! they like are so mature! They listen to you and make sure all your errors are fixed. Exept all thos times people asked admins for help when they where getting harrased and the admins then harrased them...... So now i will show you how a average joe act on this game..  **** YOU THIS GAME IS GAY **** **** **** *** **** MY MOM JUST TAUGHT ME CUSS WORDS YOU ******* **** *** *** *** *** **   So people are rely friendly and help each other out all the time. This rely is the MMO experience you deserv right?  WRONG    Fallen earth takes the regular consept and makes it better! Example: Long Crafting times Horrible Respawns Ugly World Horrible Quest lines AND OF COURSE! THE BEST PAY TO WIN MOTTO! Erm... I mean ITS THE BEST! 69/420 MLG approved

5903	0	a	I dont know whats wrong with this game, but i got a message unable to connect T.T
8330	1	a	This game is good to pass some time and to play a fun not to big rpg
5905	0	a	Please do not play this game i have a mega rig PC customly made by orgin and first the graphic are decent but meh the story is nice but this game isn't as engaging i played for a few hours but couldn't bring my self to play anymore the mechanics for aiming in 1st person are unbielivly (how do i make hearts?) so they are horrible and no updates so it gets stale and pvp big FACEPALM it is dreadful and full of hackers just dont play please. and the meta score was paid for LOLOLOLOL
5906	0	a	this game sucks
5907	0	a	I would quite honestly get a rusty knife, and slowly saw my own arm off, rather than play this game. Then afterwards, I would boil my arm and serve it at the local soup kitchen. This game is god awful, and may god have mercy on whom ever decides it would be a brilliant idea to play it. Dont waste your time.
8332	1	a	Great game! looks a lot like Fallout3 which I enjoyed playing. Though there are a few glitches as i started. great idea
5908	0	a	Spent long hours doing next to nothing and getting very angry looking for loot. takes to long to progress graphics are terrible everything is choppy and not smooth animation is poor story line is lacking even on max everything this game is very subpar and I wish time was refundable
5909	0	a	spent 2 hours trying to work out how to start the game, 10/10 still have not played it.

5910	0	a	This looks like a very interesting game to play, unfortunately, I don't know that for certain. Each time that I move my character the game locks up. Not just the locks but it locks up my whole computer so that I have to restart it. Fix that and I'll try it again. Until then I can't recommend this game at all.
8336	1	a	a low meh.
8338	1	a	War. War Never Changes.
5914	0	a	Basically an autistic Fallout.
5915	0	a	This game is playable. If every other game no longer existed. I was bellow expectation. And I'm glad I didn't pay to play it.
8340	1	a	GRIND. GRIND. GRIND. &gt;Gears of war reference &gt;but literally
5919	0	a	I have to say i was playing a while and... THE GAME IS ♥♥♥♥. It's boring, has alot of bugs ex. no sound when punching, the story is bad. I don't reccomend it for gamers, it's just a waste of a time.
5920	0	a	I haven't even play this game yet. Just wanna know why I have to agree 4 different times with 6-7 paragraph of terms and conditions like it's a contact to just play your game? I probably sign my balls away to a black martet!
8342	1	a	it just didnt work for me, but it is fun from what i heard
8344	1	a	i shall only say one thing and one thing only ... what is the meaning of badassery ... ok maby not for this game but none the less this game is a mix of intense pvp/pve at level based fairness in its so called bloodsports and enemys while also maintaining a comdy chat system in global which all you need is to get premium or something none the less this game (besides its maintnence checks which take 1-3 hours) is pretty good and ill reccomend it to anyone wanting a nice game to play without a super buffed out pc or spending a ton of money. ps the starter package on steam is probably the best one to get you only need to buy it once to access global chat forever.
5924	0	a	Trash AF
8346	1	a	THIS GAME IS FUN
8348	1	a	1)Take fallout (3 or New Vegas) 2)Add More In-depth crafting system 3) Add PVP and mounts (both horses and Vehicles) you can attack from while riding 4) Make Free to play (with premium content for purchase) 5-10) Profit
5934	0	a	its dump, cofusing, and it has the worst grapics and it takes for ever to load. 
5935	0	a	dont know how to log in 
5936	0	a	In tutorial the elevator is bugged graphic is a ♥♥♥♥!!
8350	1	a	I need help..I made two accounts for this but do not know my username. Never was provided..I wasted 5 hours of sleep waiting for this to download because I was excited to play it but nooooooooo my username or password is not correct. HELPPPP PLS
8352	1	a	Fallout 3 Online.
5953	0	a	10/10 better than fallout 4, i mean there is sooo much more, more bugs, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ graphics, etc. in this game
5954	0	a	If Fallout were on Playstation 1, this would be the outcome.
5955	0	a	10/10
8354	1	a	therapy 10/11
5956	0	a	Garbage/nuff said...i even went hard..  When i played it was so full of hackers with aimbot was sad..(2013) Even today 2014 am pretty sure there still there,The game has a weak,weak system for this problem.  Gfx are about as bad as it gets. Crafting is over the top annoying. Everyone and their mom plays as the same faction.(travs) to avoid pvp cause the combat is ...well it's that bad.  Huge map,but for the most part empty. The bad clunk controls and UI are so bad you will quit just because. The combat and shooting is total fail. I can go on for days. The battleground system will make you laugh when it loads up. You will have tears in your eyes. And again folks this game came out in like 2010 or something. So it should be way,way better.  Its free tho..give it a shot.  Best part about it is the theme...after u get over it..you will uninstall.  Uber fail game.  most of those hours were spent standing in one zone farming chips.So was pretty boring overall.
5957	0	a	This game sucks! Personal Experience
5958	0	a	it sucks
5959	0	a	This game is crap.
5960	0	a	Great game crashing bug simulator.

5984	0	a	Go buy Fallout
5985	0	a	Wow, what a piece of ♥♥♥♥. Don't take my low hours as a hunch that I am making an uninformed decision, but THE FIRST ♥♥♥♥ING MISSION WAS INCOMPLETABLE. THE ENEMY WOULDN'T SPAWN. I ♥♥♥♥ you not you cannot play 2 minutes without a game breaking glitch. Here is an updated summary of the game.... It’s 2156, and the game world has been destroyed by both nuclear and bio-chemical means, along with unsubtle hacking. Your story takes place in one of the few habitable places left in the world, the Grand Canyon, even so, the majority of the map cannot be accesed. As a clone with an uncertain past, but certain future of nothingness and imminent death, your job is survival in a world now built on destruction, betrayal, over powered hacks, and fragile factional wars.
5986	0	a	I like this game, It hase own atmosphere and many of gr8 things BUT the game support and GMs are really sucks! You can be baned for no reason FOREVER! we had a situation that we spamed in chat /help just 5 masseges or so and we were NOT muted but kicked and baned, not for few hours, not for day or week but for forever! They don't care if you payed for premium account or something! And I think that it's not fear becouse much of players spam in this help chat and the don't get ban fo this, what the reason??? How the support can say somthing abot justice if they do what they want, and blocking account as they want? They don't write ruls on a website that EVERYBODY could see them just TOS and u have to find it by yourself in forums, what the hell? They don't write for what you can be banned.  If you are a simple player and for the first time you wrote something in help channel you will be imidiatly baned for FOREVER!  And after this support told me that they never unblock my account and the question is close) that nice, really? I DON'T RECOMEND THIS GAME JUST BECOUSE AFUL SUPPORT AND GMes
5987	0	a	WOW THIS GAME TAKES SO LONG TO PLAY cUZ OF ThE ♥♥♥♥ING LAUNCHER, DONT GET, GET IF YOUR AN ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥YBOMB
5988	0	a	Fallen earth is a not bad game. The graghics arent the best but its a older game so its fine. I only played 2 hours of the game but it doesent give you information about missions to well i got lost alot. Plus the game is a grind and im only level 1. If you like a good grind try it out if you like more modern games go play Team Fortress 2 right now!
5989	0	a	10/10 if you wanna meet hitler and attract Aids x Cancer. Otherwise if your smart you will get the achievement for uninstalling.
5990	0	a	got 2 min into the game and lagged for 3 min every min. Never got through tutorial. My pc plays all other steam games effortly.

5993	0	a	Boring , bad quality and it's very big .
8360	1	a	Fallen Earth makes me ill. I recently expelled multiple bursts of excess simply from the thought of ever playing this game again. I truely hope the developers reconsider their repulsive and disgusting ways, grow fifteen ulsers and die of a violent infection caused by the opening of a cyst.
5994	0	a	This game is $H17 dont get it. Super laggy.

6021	0	a	When I was younger, I didn't put much mkoney on Steam, so I thought about buying this since Fallout I couldn't buy ( I had no $). This game was so confusing. I mean I would of payed for this but, the craft system is pretty difficult. I don't think I will ever come back to this game. This game would be nice if you could get items more efficiently, instead of having to scavenge. I mean in Fallout you do have to scavenge but theres a actual efficient money system. Don't get me wrong, but this game is terrible. If this game could be more like Fallout I would play it, and it would be nice if the graphics were a bit better the first person view gives me cancer when I look at it. I mean even Fallout graphics are better then this. The graphhics look like they didn't take their time when importing it. I really dont think you should need to craft EVERYTHING. I mean you cant even find guns on the ground.
6022	0	a	Hello,  Just before playing this game you already get problems by registering the actual account for the game, after clicking on validation email you then get redirected to this page which doesnt make any sense at all:  https://register.gamersfirst.com/register/validate/881e0442-5831-4ec7-b8e2-e9852078245c%3E   I mean seriously, how the f*** im suppose to play this game if i cant even validate my email! Fix your f*****g website already.

6026	0	a	!!!UPDATING SIMULATOR!!!  ♥♥♥♥ THIS GAME!!! THE ONLY THING YOU CAN DO HERE IS WATCH IT UPDATE
6027	0	a	This is the dumbest ♥♥♥♥ I have ever seen. I click on game try to create an account, everything goes through, Then you have to validate email which looks as though your on right site but it tells you it cannot be found. I am very annoyed I wasred time to download a game i cant trail because of stupid email validation BS. Goodluck to everyone who is trying to get it to work.

6050	0	a	I played it. Got renamed to a ridiculous name because my name offended the you know who. Then the same mod who had renamed me popped up in main chat to ask people to keep the discussion to game related Q&amp;A. I wasnt even chatting at the time, and the people who were were simply chit chatting. Apparently this is too much for this concentration camp of a game. No fun allowed. Only talk about the game.  I ♥♥♥♥ing hate this ♥♥♥♥. Burn down every game company that manages its users like stupid cattle. God forbid giving personal details or talking about fun stuff. It might create you know, DISCUSSION. We dont want that. We want submissive dull customers who only talk about the game and pay their dues. Die. Eat it and die.  Update: I uninstalled then downloaded and installed anew. Then the login bug happens... instead of fixing it, the FE devs ask you to follow a convoluted, complicated, annoying procedure that doesnt happen to work with my anti-flash setup anyway, which I cannot unset.  Why have I tried to play this game ever?

6083	0	a	♥♥♥♥ing takes so long to download and not even starting the game its so ♥♥♥♥
8392	1	a	Spent 2 hours downloading 174mb update from the launcher. 10/10
6086	0	a	My favorite part is the uninstall and also i wasted 1 hour of my life while waiting for it to install, also this isnt the real game cause you need to login in gamersfirst account and then wait for it to update which is 45 mins maximum, just buy fallout
6087	0	a	Too damn hard to level up
8394	1	a	How to Register/Login plz Help me 
6092	0	a	I played it. Got renamed to a ridiculous name because my name offended the you know who. Then the same mod who had renamed me popped up in main chat to ask people to keep the discussion to game related Q&amp;A. I wasnt even chatting at the time, and the people who were were simply chit chatting. Apparently this is too much for this concentration camp of a game. No fun allowed. Only talk about the game.  I ♥♥♥♥ing hate this ♥♥♥♥. Burn down every game company that manages its users like stupid cattle. God forbid giving personal details or talking about fun stuff. It might create you know, DISCUSSION. We dont want that. We want stupid morons who only talk about the game and pay their dues. Die. Eat it and die.
6093	0	a	crashes after 5 seconds in games
6094	0	a	Game is excellent. The Post apocaliptyc punk-set scenario that looks like Mad Max makes you wanna keep playing till you fall asleep over your keyboard. Altough the game crashed a lot at the beginning and there were a lot of bugs and a huge post download, that's not the reason i'm negativating it. Im negativating it cause the GMs are a bunch of ♥♥♥♥ing stalkers and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who at the minimum joke ban your IP, yeah that's right your IP from servers making you not able to play the game again. Piece of ♥♥♥♥ing crap administration and the guy who created this clearly had no intention of spreading it out or have a serious Player basis. 1/10 for the Game Masters.
8396	1	a	I haven't played this game in a long time. I probably forgot my password to log in and everything but from what I remember, I had A LOT of fun. I've been playing it since before it got on steam. I had at least over 70+ hours on it until steam came along where I logged in another 28 hours. From what I hear, the game is pretty dead. I really hope this isn't true because this game holds a special place in my life. It'd be too depressing to reinstall and log in to my old account only to see a dead and empty world void of players... the true post-apocalyptic wasteland experience I guess?...
6113	0	a	what the phhhhhhhhhhuck? phhhhhhhuck this game phhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhucking phhhhhuuuuuuuuuck  the ppppppppphhhhhhhhhhhhhucking ♥♥♥♥♥  (jumps into frozen pool actually breaks it)
8398	1	a	THIS IS THE GREATEST FALLOUT RIP OFF OF ALL TIME!
6118	0	a	The system for new players is extremly confusing and many times i found myself in situations where i was in areas that were way to high level for me. In my opinion not worth playing.
6119	0	a	It's like Skyrim, but an mmo about the post appocalypse instead.
6120	0	a	how to start the ♥♥♥♥ing game 
6121	0	a	Cant even start the damn game! when i have logged in and started the game it just sais i am already logged in and it wont start...... BRUHHHHHH

I ♥♥♥♥ing hate this ♥♥♥♥. Burn down every game company that manages its users like stupid cattle. God forbid giving personal details or talking about fun stuff. It might create you know, DISCUSSION. We dont want that. We want submissive dull customers who only talk about the game and pay their dues. Die. Eat it and die.
6124	0	a	WOW 1 hour of typing in my password and username nothing work even though nothing changed and nothing is wrong. ♥♥♥♥ the people who make this game and APB they are worthless
6125	0	a	IT WORKED! THE UNINSTALL BUTTON ACTUALLY WORKED!  I don't have to look at other reviews to see why this game is bad. I am the unlucky one who actually played it. I didnt even have to beat half he tutorial to notice wasted potential and lies from the screenshots. When i downloaded this game, I expected something like fallout 4 multiplayer. What I got was nothing like that. Here is a list of the pros and cons of the game: Pros: (God this is short) -This is F2P. -As before mentioned, the uninstall button works very well. -It has live action battles, unlike many games that are similar. (What I think of is Star Wars: The Old Republic) -I can tell you not to get it. Cons: -♥♥♥♥♥♥ graphics unless you have a super computer -Restarts to change options -When it restarts, you have to close it if you log in with steam -Of the 3.2 hours I played, 3 of them were trying to get the game to log me in and let me play -Does t include a 'draw distance' option. I still don't know how to fix it. -Minimum requirements = This game will launch on your computer at lowest graphics at 1 fps (XP users be warned) -♥♥♥♥♥♥ controls (W and S are the only proper ones. The rest make me want to press mmb, select myself, and suicide) -Lag... on the tutorial -GRAPHICS GLITCHES!!!!!!!! -Lag on worse computers makes combat impossible. The point where I said no means no -Reason I have PTSD  Overall opinion: this is a great game... to test that trusty uninstall button.
6126	0	a	What the hell is this?!?
6127	0	a	when i first tried this game my mom was in a hospital, she called me so she could say her goodbyies to me but i told her to ♥♥♥♥ off cus i was busy trying to register on this piece of ♥♥♥♥. once my mom was dead and i finally got in, i was disappointed to find out that i wasted my time on playing this game rather than ♥♥♥♥ing my mom for the one last time
8400	1	a	If you like Fallout this is for you or anyone whos looking to have fun
6132	0	a	If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.  Ingredients: 1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter 2. 1/2 cup white sugar 3. 1/2 cup brown sugar 4. 1/4 cup water 5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon 6. 1 pinch salt 7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced 8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie   Directions: 1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside. 3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices. 4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.  But really, this game blows now, even more than it did before which I didn't think was possible.

6154	0	a	Only played for 3 hours and already found it gay. You can only pvp if you AND the other players type /pvp command (which no one does so PVP is out of the question). And the NPC is stupid and gay.....I was standing infront of them and they didnt see me. This game is gay......gay......Any game that has Free2Play in the title is one that desperately needs players....probably because its so gay to have players in the first place....so the game is gay....&lt;3 and peace.
8402	1	a	this is fallout online. its the TRUE fallout 3!
8404	1	a	the game is great, i got no probleme with it ecsept the travel time. walking from point A to point B takes a while and by the time you get your first mount you will already be bored of walking.
6164	0	a	Very buggy, few lag problems, confusing Ui and Controls, Gameplay aspects are a bit bland and animations stiff. Not the best kind of RPG I have ever played. Definitly won't recommend this game.
8406	1	a	This game is very good reminds me off fallout, very fun to do the missions and craft all the items you need.

8410	1	a	Eh its ok
8412	1	a	:)
8414	1	a	is like fallout 3 but it FREE
8416	1	a	I have played the game i significant amount of time, and i have to say its definitely worth it. The crafting system is pretty in depth and there is plenty to do as far as mmos go. It definitely helps if you have other people playing with you though.
8418	1	a	A good Post-apocalyptic game.  Sorta confusing and not knowing what to do at first but you get there.  Haven't spent much time on it but it's a good game.
8420	1	a	If i remember correctly (It has been quite some time since i played this last) It was pretty good. Its basically skyrim on a ♥♥♥♥ budget and its glitchy sometimes but when it does work its pretty fun. You have to actually be smart with what you do sonce oyu can die from lack of food and water and stealth actuallly works on the AI/other players whcih is pretty neat i think. It kept me interested for a while so id say give it a shot. I mean its free so why not?
6171	0	a	confuseing to try and make this work 
8422	1	a	This game is epic. Cannot believe I've gone all these years and not tried it before. I've been missing out. :P
8424	1	a	epic game with huge open world worth playing
8426	1	a	A lot to do for a new player. Very much like an online, not-so-gore-filled version of Fallout. As a F2P it is expected to be a heavy grinder or Pay for Premium deal. Where you can grind and spend more time to craft, level up abilities, and travel from place to place in game as opposed to a Premium member, but it makes up for it in pure in-game content and a fun post-apocalyptice free-to-play MMO-RPG. Bored often? Create a Fallen Earth account.
8428	1	a	Well if you like fallout you like this
8430	1	a	Post-apocalyptic games are on the top of my list of 'favourite games' and Fallen Earth represents that in a fairly decent way. While I haven't played much of it and do recommend others over it, FE is fun to play, and the design is quite beautiful. I'd rec. it if you're into wastelands ;)
8432	1	a	It takes a while to get used to but stick to it and it's really great fun. The crafting is amazing and the combat is very different than the usual MMO style. This game deserves a try. Give it a few hours and keep an open mind and you'll definitely see what I mean.  The controls are a bit odd at the beginning but you get used to it after a while. The atmosphere of this game is great. I've never felt more involved in a game world then in this one, it's an amazing experience. I just wish more people knew about this game, the craftable vehicles alone are a great experience.
8434	1	a	EAT THIS ♥♥♥♥ ITS GOOD
8436	1	a	A good game but the grinding takes to long the game could have some better missions they get boring overtime .... 
6173	0	a	Free to plays are normally not that good but this game is bad no sound and horrible graphics and not to mention the awful gameplay
6174	0	a	'collating data'   best download simulator
8438	1	a	It's not very innovative, but at the time of this writing, many of the problems faced by other MMO's, especially free to play ones, are virtually nonexistant in this. Except for the nice, not in-your-face reminder of the benefits of a premium account at the start screen, there is NOTHING in game to remind you that you got this for free. I have not played this through all the way yes, but as far as I HAVE seen, there are no arbitrary level caps or item requires on free players. One of the best features about this game too is the combat:Compared to any regular FPS or shooter, it'd be boring, but with a lot of MMO's being a boring clickfest, it seems much better in comparison. The freeroaming from the start is nice too, there are starting quests and a small plot, but nothing prevents you from wandering hundreds of miles really if you feel like it. It does however, for strange reasons, take FOREVER to download, even on fast computers. Otherwise, great game. 
8440	1	a	the 3 day install my favorite part
6176	0	a	NAFF game, best to play Fallout 3, or something else, but not this, read other reviews for more indepth stuff.
8442	1	a	An old amazing game, that seems to have never died since it came out, now the population has shunken through-out the years, but you still see people buying think with real moey to get in-game money, and that just shows there still are those few that still have not given up, and are still keeping the server active, and the game over all alive, dont get me wrong, its fun. but after a while. when you get to that point where its just like ' Every monster is the same' its because the monsters and mobs are not really any diffrent, human or what ever other creature, they're all for the most part ranged enemy, and have poison, a sniper, ex. So try this game out its fun, but be warned YOU WILL GET BORED AFTER A WEEK OF GAMEPLAY.
6179	0	a	Review Date: 1/5/2015  Back in 1999-2001 (When i was in middle school), the game I enjoyed at the time was Runescape. For those that wish to find a 'Fallout' experience, this is NOT it. I tried to get into it but I just couldn't. It is F2P, so by all means try it and I hope you enjoy it.   My favorite games throughout the years have been:  PC Diablo and Diablo 2 (The rest of the series sadly changed) Skyrim Series Final Fantasy Series Fallout Series  007 Goldeneye Counter Strike  Call of Duty Halo/Halo 2/Halo 3/Halo 5 (All other halo titles are the equivalent of Diablo 2 vs Diablo 3, im sure others would agree)  I hope a team of devs arrive with an endless budget and a total wow killer. I would like and would pay $60 for purchase and $5/month to $15/month for this.  Suspense (remember Resident Evil: Directors Cut?) Crafting  PVP separated from PVE (on same server, just a 'wasteland' area that is anything goes *high risk/high reward* A true shooter *halo/cod type controls* Eye Candy Graphix (computers are getting quite fast now, you can build a very decent server for a tenth of what it would of cost to perform the same just 4 years ago)  I suppose all you would have to do is get backed by Microsoft or Sony and make them sign on paper it will not release until it is polished enough for a very cheap or free beta. Once in beta, you have 1 year to make it bug/hacker free, then start adding content.  Do this and you will dominate the game market. 
6180	0	a	I'm going to be honest and say just skip this game and go for fallout 3. It's not free to play but they should be paying you to play this game.
6181	0	a	terrible and boring
8444	1	a	good game needs more enemys follow me on instagram #zachchannel
8446	1	a	If you enjoy large-world games this may be one for you. The crafting system is large and complex and the dusty plains provide a very fitting frame for the story. There's the option of going for missions or crafting as you level up, either way will make your character progress as you play. The GUI was daunting at first but after a few hours it felt more comfortable to use - but never easy or intuitive. As it stands now I'm on the verge of putting real money into the game, since I feel the developers have created a world that pulls me where other post-apocalyptic games have had a plastic, artificial feel to them. If you enjoy exploration and crafting, definitely try out this free to play version at the very least!
6182	0	a	dont play this game for it sucks really bad!
8448	1	a	What is Fallen Earth? Fallen Earth like a MMO Metro 2033 only minus Russians talking in English with silly Reznov voices.
8450	1	a	Don't listen to the ones who have anything bad to say about this game 'Oh the animation is kind of ehhh' and stuff... Free, fun, great time killer.  Great game, very well built for being a free.
8452	1	a	Good .. ! not bad look like Fallout (y)
8454	1	a	fun looking game can not wait to lvl up
8456	1	a	yes it is a good fallout like game 
8458	1	a	Like an MMO Fallout game...hard to explain unless you try it yourself. I sorta enjoyed it for the hour or so I played it, so yeah.
8460	1	a	GREAT!! IT AWSOME
6183	0	a	0/10 would not recommend to use as lube
8462	1	a	Great game,there is always something to do,even if you get bored of doing events ,you can always craft something or keep killing creatures,&amp; harvest everything.
8464	1	a	It's pretty good both gameplay wise and story wise. It only gets better with friends and even better the farther you get, and as you explore the world of Fallen Earth.
8466	1	a	Good game until you reach a certain level that the game becomes to repetitive and you loose interest.
8468	1	a	A game with great concept, great community, fun to play, a decent levelling system and some great mmo style timesinks. Similar to Fallout 3 if you were playing whilst another million ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ were playing. It does feel like another game using the source engine which is sad. If it were smoother and prettier and had sexier graphics I would play it 24/7 and poop sock all day. But hey if you're using a toaster, go on ahead.
8470	1	a	Addictive PvE, addictive crafting, and an interesting backdrop. Just wouldn't suggest the PvP aspects unless you have a high-end rig that can pull in 60-150 FPS consistently.
8472	1	a	Hello there. My name is Horatio McDangle and I will be your reccomender. This game is fun. Thank you for reading, have a nice ♥♥♥♥ buddy.
8474	1	a	I love how the mount doesn't disappear when you no longer need it and need to go somewhere on foot.
8476	1	a	I like the feel of the environments and the action in combat, many different playstyles can be incorporated in this game right off the bat! (i hope i used incorporated properly...) Heck, even the voice acting was more than i expected in a free MMO!
6186	0	a	1/100 This is how bad this game is. The engine they made for this is crap. The graphics, crap. Story could have been executed a whole lot better. If any other developer tried to make this story, it would've been a 10/10.
8478	1	a	I played this game in Beta, and it has come so far since then. Great graphics, target orriented combat, thousands of missions, best crafting system Ive seen in a game (you can be all proffesions) and random bonuses. Everyone is on one server. I subscribed, but there is no need to, f2p offers a ton in itself.
8480	1	a	Clone Simulator 2013: Wasteland edition. In the game, you play as a clone of someone (Which looks like the character you created.) On a expiration date. because you use teleporters to reach the main base of the resistence and messed with you atomical struckure or something, you are no longer able to, let's just say 'Run into a field of enemies, die 'n' respawn.' This game is essintially 'Fallout 3: The clone uprising; MMO edition'   I think there's a crafting system? i haven't played since like 2013.  No but really, play it if you haven't. it has all your 'I'm-dying-because-I'm-a-clone-of-some♥♥♥♥♥♥♥-tha's-probley-dead-by-now-so-i-can-join-him-or-her' Needs.
8482	1	a	Do not try, this game, technical support at GM lvl really sux, i just asked for help in the help channel and main GM just muted me w/o saying nothing in exchange. Well Mr. Radash, u can shove ur attitude somewhere and be happy about it, u know?
8484	1	a	Good game with Oblivion and Fallout elements
6187	0	a	TL;DR: Have you ever played an MMO? This is an MMO. It plays like an MMO with a lot of limitations. Unless you have lots of patience. Hours worth. Days worth.  Looking at this game after some time has passed, I realized that I fell into an MMO trap.  This game is actually not that great if you like action games. You spend a lot of time doing a lot of nothing. Crafting, gathering, grinding. I don't recommend this for people that like action, just buy New Vegas and mod it. Or wait for H1Z1 to come out, or buy that. Or wait for the Mad Max game. Or put a small dev team together and make an interesting game similar to this.
6188	0	a	Like a survival game but terrible.
6189	0	a	the good's: +mad max type game  the bads: -slow gameplay  -last last gen graphics 
8486	1	a	This is the first game i played on steam and it got me into games like Fallout and DayZ
6191	0	a	Remove the verification that's what makes so much people hate your game so yea I deam it un-playable
8488	1	a	This is as badass as it gets. Think of it as Fallout: New Vegas: The MMO, except that you get horses, ATVS, motorcycles, choppers, dune buggies, cars and even a mutant wolf to ride, every gun being craftable and rewarded via PvP and quests, major focus in world pvp aswell as competitive PvP arenas, and oh so much more. I have never seen such a fun to work with, and easy to use crafting system in any other MMO. It is easy to grab the materials you need, level it up, and build the next gun, sword, motorcycle, or armor with. This game will keep you entertained FOREVER. There are no seperate servers, but rather just one big one, so you will always have players at your side and truly have that 'MMO' feel all while not fighting over drops that NPCs give and the such. This is also one of few games that traveling far distances is actually enjoyable in. This game is absolutely HUGE and literally takes hours and hours to cross an entire region. I wish I could write more, but this is just gold.
8490	1	a	I like this game. Ha, End of story, its a very good post apocalyptic game for people loking for a raiding,quest finding thrill.
6196	0	a	One of the worst games I have ever played. I can't believe I lasted an hour. Terrible controls, braindead AI, unfinished mechanics, this whole game in general feels unfinished. It has a lot of potential because the story seems interesting but I can't play another minute of this filth.
8492	1	a	Anyone addicted to the Fallout series will definitely be addicted to this game. I imagine if Fallout 3 had an mmo, this would be it.
6198	0	a	this game is terrible, self immolation is better than this.
8494	1	a	after playing for 41 hours i can tell you that this game is epic! theres soooo much to do like go hunting doing side quests or working towards gathering richers or building an atv or motorcycle or spending your riches on worthless thing when you start out just like i did   you can sit for hours killing and scaverging just to sit for hours and craft   but be carefuyl when further out in the wastes there are many CHOTA(chidren of the apocolipse) fortresses or towns out there and some of em can be full of dangers and well hundreds of CHOTA   overall i would give 12/10
6199	0	a	oh my days. what a pile of steamy crap.  this has all the makings to be a good(ish, well, maybe) game. but as it is, it is as it stated above. the first thing you will notice is how hidious the control scheme/layout is. it just feels so wrong, sort of shagging your mothers best freind wrong, and then you acidently send your mum one of the pics with you wearing her best freind like a puppet.  that is how wrong the control layout feels. due to the major flaw and the other major factor that wvwry one who plays this game is a sad lonely pervert, who persistanly talks slander and poo, unless they think your a girl,then you can tell there typing one handed, while the other is already at the lotion.  so make what you will of my review, my reviews are honest, unlike most, with the crack licking, ring shining , im after free crap speaches. #keep your free crap for a good review, my toungue is for my lady's batty, not dev's. kids, remember that one
8496	1	a	so cool!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!but i cant play it cuz it wont let me creat an account
6200	0	a	was much better before it got taken over again a game that's being ruined by G1!
8498	1	a	While the graphics are a bit dated and the community is less than optimal, this game has alot going for it. It features a great crafting aspect and lots of interesting lands and sidequests to explore. Everything in the game that you can use has to be crafted. This is a warning for those who do not enjoy crafting as you will be doing it. Whether it is crafting gas for vehicles or vehicles themselves, you have to do it or have someone do it for you. There is a very helpful community ingame to help. All in all a great game worth checking out, especially as it is F2P.
8500	1	a	The only post-apocalyptic MMO available. It's good, but the game is not for everyone. If you hate grinding and crafting then I would suggest finding something else to play. That being said, this game is good enough that it makes you wish there was a Fallout MMO.
8502	1	a	Not a bad game and such but  I would rec to join a helpful clan
8504	1	a	So much fun, very addicting. Played it for over 8 hours straight. XD 5 out of 5 stars!! Love the graphics, love the design and theme behind the game. The story is very addicting, I can't get enough of it. I am about to go hop on it again lol. Warning its very addicting and you won't wanna stop!!
6202	0	a	So i'm really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off..WHO THE ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ added the tag surviaval to the game?!!! I mean cmon are u reall people with you selfs ..You call this game survival ?You are pathetic at least for adding that tag to the game..NO ladies and gents this is not a survival game .The only thing it has is that u search for resources to make things like a crosbow for e.x but not survival like the dayZ series are....This is pathetic....I only recomened if u want to play a game where every npc amke you his 'errand-boy'...Also one otehr thing u have like some sort of superpowers taht u use..Not post apocalyptic but after apocalyptic so the far future my tag for this game and ofcourse NOT A A SURVIVAL GAME AT ALL!!!!! IF you like survival games like me then this game is not for u you are wasting your time with it,!!! .-
8506	1	a	Fallen Earth is set in a *huge* world. Just about everything in the world can be built from things, scavenged from the old world. And in the late game, one can settle down on a farm and protect it from raiders, etc. Or join a clan and fight other clans for territory. And there is also a set plot line that one can follow by completing the story quests. Or one can ignore the plot, altogether and just do whatever floats your boat, at the time.  A very enjoyable game that I see myself popping into and out of for a long time.
8508	1	a	Love this game need to play it more
8510	1	a	People would say this is a rip off of fallout but i think it has more features in it, something fallout wouldn't have(unless you have mods for fallout) but its actally kinda cool that fallen earth is a free to play game that you get to survive the apoclypse  with your friends and other players. But it's like fallout with multiplayer and new things added to it,but this is not fallout  this is FALLEN EARTH. I would say 10/10 you should play this game.
8512	1	a	If u love survival games this is ment for you. I played this once and i got hooked. scavenging and the voice acting is fantastic. its pretty darn good for a free 2 play game.
6204	0	a	Clunky in every regard and for a game that boasts 95% of all its items are player-crafted it has a really boring crafting system.
8514	1	a	I haven't played it but IT LOOKS LIKE A GAME FOR ME! I just love the Fallout Games and this is so much like it! So yes i recommend this game ALLLLLLLOOOOOOTTTTTTT!
8516	1	a	This game looks great and it's gameplay is good too!
8518	1	a	While there are other MMORPGs that might have a better story or better graphics, I always come back to Fallen Earth, the deep crafting system and the Gameplay is like no other Game I know of, so even after 5 years, I still start it from time to time and always have a good time.
8520	1	a	of coruse
8522	1	a	its a pretty good game i recommand it for those that like post apoc. MMORPG's.
8524	1	a	Awesome game great graphics and realistic driving. 
8526	1	a	really good game 
8528	1	a	omg its so gut
8530	1	a	No spoilers here   Underrated game but i strongly recommend Fallen Earth  Complex and not easy to get into at first but once you get the hang of it you will feel satisfied upon accomplishing tasks  Storyline is very well elaborated upon but the gameplay is a plus  Overall it gives a more ' survival ' feel  It has day-night cycles    
6209	0	a	I have started playing Fallen Earth several times, first time about a month after launch. I really do want to like this game. There is something relly cool and intreresting about the whole post-apocalyptic-scavenger scenario.. But even though I would really like to enjoy it I have always played it for a day or two, gotten bored and logged out.  The base concept is fantastic, but there is just sometihng about the game that never manages to keep me intrerested for very long.. F2P was a great move according to me as it let's me keep it on my harddrive and whenever I get that itch, I can log in for an hour, realize I still don't quite enjoy it and log out.   Maybe some day!
6210	0	a	Free2Play so typical model applies.  1. Make first few levels interesting 2. Give a teaser of decent stuff within the first few hours 3. Offer free stuff if you come back every day 4. Charge for Pay2Win items 5. Make the enemies scale unfairly against you so you spend weeks replaying old areas so you can progress a little bit forward or pay to keep the progression fluid  I know this is how almost all Free2Plays are, hence why I called it the typical model, but Fallen Earth doesnt offer anything for the casual player (or one that isnt rich or has stollen his parents credit card!)  Not a bad game for the first few hours, but after that it gets very dull very fast and there are a lot of other free games out that offer much more so I cant recommend it.
8532	1	a	I Just Love The Smell Of Napalm In The Morning!
6211	0	a	When a free game isn't worth it....when you can't play it. Can't even login. Took several attempts to even get an email sent to me when creating an account. The validating link in the email wouldn't work. Was able to copy and paste into browser window and somehow it validated my account and gave me the username: G1-2c43b9b9-ceb9-4d0f.   The kicker? Still could not login. No help found. So I went to gamersfirst (the fly-by-night company responsible for hosting this game) and went to the forums, couldn't even see them without registering a seperate forum account. Which I did. The technical support thread was awash with technical problems from every single aspect of the game. Initial load screen, logging in, etc.   Not missing much because from what else I have read this game is dead. It was released 3 years ago and aside from a few stragglers there is no online community worth playing this game.
8534	1	a	Plaied before and it seemed pretty good but i had a bad computer and now i am redownloading it and seeing if it is still as good 
6212	0	a	Cant log in, tried steam and G1 account. Thanks. A lot. Was really looking forward to playing this and I cant.  0 stars.
6213	0	a	yeah this ♥♥♥♥ing steaming pile of ♥♥♥♥ isnt even worth trying to download to see because for one i have to make a ♥♥♥♥ing account on some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ site then its got the update box going on and on and it never ♥♥♥♥ing words going round in circles so i can't even get into the game to see and with all the other negative comments i've seen and how medoicre the pictures look on this page is pretty damn convincing its not worth my ♥♥♥♥ing time if you give these people money please die.
8536	1	a	This is as good as MMO`s Get. It has everything you would want in a MMO. It has everything from spells from WOW and weapons from black ops 2.
6214	0	a	dont play this  its okay but not as worth your time as some other similar games
6215	0	a	Trust me when I say this game is awful. It has terrible loading times and over all is a glitchy mess to play. And since it's a free to play game it is legally obligated to have microtransactions in it, and boy are there plenty.
8538	1	a	its alrice
8540	1	a	speachless
8542	1	a	Pretty good
8544	1	a	If i remember correctly (It has been quite some time since i played this last) It was pretty good. Its basically skyrim on a ♥♥♥♥ budget and its glitchy sometimes but when it does work its pretty fun. You have to actually be smart with what you do sonce oyu can die from lack of food and water and stealth actuallly works on the AI/other players whcih is pretty neat i think. It kept me interested for a while so id say give it a shot. I mean its free so why not?
8546	1	a	This game is like fallout 
8548	1	a	Extremely addictive, can never run out of things to do and great community. F2P.
8550	1	a	Great game, Everybody on this game is very helpful and nice, Definately Recommend this game.
6219	0	a	Terrible game. Took an hour to go through the rediculous 'learn 2 play' (required), then the game glitched out and I could never move any further in the game. Community is terrible. I asked for help and everyone just laughed and said it happens, start over. No. I do not want to waste another hour going through what I already did because of glitchy game. Wasn't even really fun anyways. Don't waste your time.
6220	0	a	turned to crap after year 3. took out a nice cool backdrop entro movie and changed the starting tutorial in the hoover damn so much that its now complete ♥♥♥♥. used to be awesome. now its this game world where every time u log in its got this pay to play window up and won't go away till u stand there for 20 minutes. they really force players to pay to play and horde 50% of the game content in the store now. its turned to ♥♥♥♥. don't play it.
8552	1	a	Two words:  Fun game.
8554	1	a	Fallout rip off... yes. Still awesome... HECK YES!!!
8556	1	a	Guys, i recomand this game because is a post-Apocaliptic survival game and is a massive multyplayer game
8558	1	a	The world of fallen earth is a trecherous one! With enemies around every corner, you better watch your back at all times, or be killed faster than you can say 'fallen'.  The Pros- -A huge expansive world with much to do, and see -many choices on character development -This game has vehicles that you can drive &amp; and animals you can ride -The Missions can sometimes flow together very nicely -You can choose what you do, what missions to take/what not to do (all faction missions effect the opposing faction's respect for you) -Many different styles too choose from -You can use a market to purchase anything from other players (which is helpful if you're looking for an upgrade you can't find. - The Cons-  -since the map is really large, you will be spending most of your time driving for 20 minutes to get to the next town. -The learning curve is very steep, and takes time to master. -Most missions are basic. Example: 'go too the next town and kill some of the vista's for us' Refer to first con I stated -This game is VERY Pay2Win, with a Chip (currency) cap of 10000, you can't get very far without paying for an item, (which, depending on what you buy, can be very cheap, or expensive.) -You start off really overwhelmed by enemies, A basic level 2 will kill you in only a couple well placed hits -The progression system can make, or break your experience. If you don't level up, just right. and pick the right things, You will be completely overwhelmed by enemies later in the game  Even despite the cons, Fallen Earth Is an enjoyable experience and has entertained me for hours apon hours of entertainment. The story had me questioning everything that happened ( even though predictable at times) You should note, This game is Not for everyone, The learning curve is only for the faint of heart, and the difficulty is Very hard at lower levels. New players be warned.
8560	1	a	this is a great roleplaying game about america after ww3 and i love this game so i recomend it for EVERYONE
8562	1	a	all get this game its epic 
8564	1	a	Post Apocalyptic MMO that all Fallout, Elder Scrolls payer will like, so far havent seen anything wrong with this!! :) Graphics: 7/10 Gameplay: 8/10 Storyline: 8/10 Difficulty at Start of Game: Moderatly Difficult, Tutorial a little general.  
8566	1	a	Amazing game, it's free, third person, not much else to say, download, play, have fun!
8568	1	a	great game would defenitly recommend this to friends
8570	1	a	well let me start out with saying...  when i first tried to login it didn't work so yeah i used 2 hours to try and fix it.  then i went to the loading screen it took FOREVER. and the graphics looks like it was made in 2007 but the gameplay worked fine so i would say... 5/10 
8572	1	a	.
8574	1	a	Downloaded.... few minutes later. Yay! about to play the game , woops new updated, downloaded... downloaded... downloaded... meh uninstalled.  WASTE YOUR TIME SIMULATOR 2015 10/10
8576	1	a	Ok this is a good game by the looks its like fallout just with worst grafics and difrent stroy. WARNING: Theres alout of downloading! I really think I should of got this when it came out. Peace.
8578	1	a	I played this game for some time, even before it was released on steam. It is a good game for those who want to spend much time in one game, but if you are looking for continuosly adventure and exitment, i would personally not recommend this game. This game is full of possibilities and hours of exploration, but if you are a Fallout fan, do not expect this game to be alike. The quests are long and hard, you even have to travel long distances to get back to complete your quest.   1. Leveling is hard. 2. It`s a 'every man for himself game'. Due to the lack of teamwork, and community to get organized in. 3. You have to spend money on the game to be sucessful, and to make a cool character. 4. I would reccomend this game to: people who like to play alot, and got the patience to travel for hours for little XP/ profit.  I hope this helps you out if you want to start playing! Peace out! :)
8580	1	a	One of the better sandbox experiences on the market.   -Great crafting system -Decent skills system -Combat can be quite fun -Great atmosphere in game  Enemy AI and interface rather ruin the experience. But I'd still recommend checking it out as an example of how an open world can game be done.
8582	1	a	Fun game, good time waster for free.
6223	0	a	When I played this game for the first time I was amused. Do note I have never played a single fallout game, but if you're looking for that I have a hunch you wont find it here.  The game is more of an MMORPG with an apocolypse skin. Microtransactions help a lot as well, almost too much. (Bigger inventory, etc.)   After spending about 8-10 hours leveling you will find things get very excessively difficult. I recall playing a TANK and having to heal after every fight despite having a leveling partner landing headshots over and over again. The name of the game becomes kiting and I was pretty much put in a spot where I felt useless. Once NPC's have guns, forget it unless you have a party. They don't miss. Ever.  The leveling system is stupid and punishes you for not knowing what you're doing at the start.  I would give the game a 6/10, I've for sure played worse. It has aged poorly, though. Wouldn't bother now. Much better choices out there.
6224	0	a	this gem sucks
8584	1	a	I read a lot about people comparing this to Fallout. It is not fallout. They may have said to themselves that post apocolyptic mmos would be awesome after playing fallout then made this but that is all. Besides that I love having weapons show on my character and the quests are just like any other mmo. I recommend this game for the fact it is free and not bad at all. Also it uses so little bandwidth it is fun to play when your downloading and you'll never notice the lag. Feeding your horse kind of sucks though but hay, they gotta eat.
8586	1	a	Ehh, it's... alright to say the least. Compared to other games I have in my library it had satisfactions that kept me playing that I very quickly soon found in other games, which in turn stopped me from playing this game. Progression is often slow and tedious, quests are repetitive and the environments are bland, and I don't mean that they're deliberately bland to give a post-apocalyptic, I mean there is almost nothing to them, like a boring version of Fallout 3. Graphics aren't great either, even on high settings, neither is the combat or gunplay. Still, it's free at least. Honestly it's worth a shot but there are better F2P games out there. I only recommend it if you're looking for a decent F2P Fallout-esque game and you haven't got the funds to buy Falloutt 3 and/or New Vegas.  (That said though, I only played the game for a total of two hours, so maybe I haven't seen enough? If so let me know).
6225	0	a	Worst game ever 2014  Wouldneverplayagain/10
6226	0	a	This game is difficult to tolerate. The clunky control scheme, messed up graphics, and buggy environments ruin any redeeming velue that might exist.
8588	1	a	There is MUCH potential to where this could head to. I see it happening as well.. Deserves for you gamers to give it a try for sure!
6228	0	a	I dont like this game its really B mmorpg
8590	1	a	This is definitly a niche game but if you like games that do not hand everything out to you and have a steep learning curve this game is for you. Barely any useful quest rewards, if you want something you have to go out farm for mats and craft the items yourself or pay someone else to do it. Beautiful graphics and fpslike gameplay seal the deal. Definitely not for everyone, but those who it is for it is a hidden gem.
8592	1	a	Helluva lot of fun with friends. Or making friends inside. Big roleplaying community. Combat is very different, guns are difficult to use in a run and gun fashion, but it's mostly simple.
6229	0	a	cant even get it to run, i made an account and it says wrong user and pass even though i know that its not wrong.
8594	1	a	Yes Its its a ummmmmm ya get it
8596	1	a	I have played the game i significant amount of time, and i have to say its definitely worth it. The crafting system is pretty in depth and there is plenty to do as far as mmos go. It definitely helps if you have other people playing with you though.
8598	1	a	It's not very innovative, but at the time of this writing, many of the problems faced by other MMO's, especially free to play ones, are virtually nonexistant in this. Except for the nice, not in-your-face reminder of the benefits of a premium account at the start screen, there is NOTHING in game to remind you that you got this for free. I have not played this through all the way yes, but as far as I HAVE seen, there are no arbitrary level caps or item requires on free players. One of the best features about this game too is the combat:Compared to any regular FPS or shooter, it'd be boring, but with a lot of MMO's being a boring clickfest, it seems much better in comparison. The freeroaming from the start is nice too, there are starting quests and a small plot, but nothing prevents you from wandering hundreds of miles really if you feel like it. It does however, for strange reasons, take FOREVER to download, even on fast computers. Otherwise, great game. 
8600	1	a	I ♥♥♥♥ing love this game. This is basically a PVP Fallout MMO. It's amazing. The only downside to it is, the GMs have disappeared, there doesn't appear to be any more development into the game/expansions etc, and it has a negative community in-game.   I would recommend it to all my friends but at the same time I wouldn't. I would like to see the creators of this game come back to it and add more content to it or if anything fix a lot of the bugs inside it.
6234	0	a	It's like fallout with cancer
8602	1	a	is this a game like runescape where after a certain point you need to pay for a sub???
8604	1	a	Total grindfest, kinda a love/hate game
8606	1	a	Best first person/ third person mmorpg action pact awesomeness that you will find on the net. Pvp game play is real fun and the crafting system is one of the most complex i have ever seen check it out.
8608	1	a	a good post apocilptyc atmosphere , a world to explore and the great adventure in wasteland!! 
8610	1	a	I love this game more than myself, my dog, and my foot
8612	1	a	A very good post apocolypse mmo. next to swtor the best free to play out there.
8614	1	a	Interesting post-apocalypse Free-to-play MMO game! A lot of gameplay...
6241	0	a	Well i played this game like 3 years ago, everything was so cool back then. After a while me and my buddy reached end game, joined clans blah blah, game suddenly became less enjoyable not because of bugs, glitches, but the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ness of GMs. I had so many play hours in this game, but the game never changes. And the Gms + Support never care for players, all they care is money. If you really want to play this game, think again.
6242	0	a	The only part of this game that met my expectations was the uninstall button. I didn't think all of the negative reviews could possibly be true, considering how cool the ideas sounded on paper. And then I played it. Every facet of this game could've been accomplished better in a few weeks by any other studio. I, with no experience, could've designed a better looking UI. The gunplay is utterly terrible. The graphics are severly outdated, even by 2011's standards. The community is hostile. I didn't even get far enough in to mess with the customizable vehicles. Do yourself a favor and just get Borderlands instead.
6243	0	a	0/10 would not recommend to use as lube
8616	1	a	Great game,there is always something to do,even if you get bored of doing events ,you can always craft something or keep killing creatures,&amp; harvest everything.
6244	0	a	thought it would be fun with friends  after all most mmos are amusing as a social activity and not really for stellar AAA munnies and gwafix but it wasnt fun with friends  and now i have no friends  ...  does anybody remember wizardry online?  why did that die and this hasnt like i was trying to be funny and melodramatic at the start but its actually perplexing to thing about  this game sucks G\5 rating  (johntron joke) :D
6245	0	a	let me start with the game the game is okay the graphics is okay the crafting is cool the open sandbox world is best but he ♥♥♥♥ing ignorant fat ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ gm's are so ♥♥♥♥ing trash that this game should be burn or change staffs this fat ♥♥♥♥s pick favorates the old players who kiss ♥♥♥ to the gm's can get you muted and banned unfearly and this suck a ♥♥♥♥ game is not it they dont even notify you on how long or why are you banned i mean your not breakign any rules but if one of there favorate player dont like what you said and your not sucking up to them or the gm's they ♥♥♥♥ing mute you for days without giving you a notice why and you send a ticket you get answer by a ♥♥♥♥ing robot by that means this game and there stuff are ♥♥♥♥ing completely useless and just let the old kiss ♥♥♥ fat ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ players who plays the game 24/7 control the game i mean this fat ♥♥♥♥s just throw banned like its funny after you spend countless dollars my advice dont spend a single ♥♥♥♥ on this game and buy a game where they treat new players equal to the old players and not get involve and pick sides this Fat ♥♥♥♥s who called them self Gm's should be ♥♥♥♥ing fired from there job's
6246	0	a	dont play this game its awful
8618	1	a	wasted my time ? YES I DID AND NEVER DO IT AGAIN
8620	1	a	Fallout style free-to-play mmorpg that DOESN'T demand a sh!t load of money to make it playable, or try to leech your wallet for in-game items and cash. It even manges to keep the play balanced between non-pay and pay gamers, while still providing an incentive to pay.  Give it a try, its not like it'll cost you anything. :)
6247	0	a	Games overall rating is 8/10, it has good idea of gameplay, but is bad optimized for low end pc and that makes it bit annoying
8622	1	a	Great game been playing for years good community chat and help. lots of room to breath with the large maps of Desert and Grand canyon. very versatile mounts and vehicles . lots of missions.
6248	0	a	♥♥♥♥.
6249	0	a	While Fallen Earth is an enjoyable MMO set in a Fallout universe, there are some glaring issues that impact the experience of the game. The biggest problem I have had is to connect to the game. As soon as you choose / create your character the game gets stuck on a loading screen. No indication as to what the problem was, I looked online, and a huge amount of people had the same issue. Eventually I narrowed this down to a connection issue between the game client and the servers. The Devs refuse to be transparent about this, which says a lot, especially in a MMO. This failure of the devs to be transparent and the 6 months of them failing to fix the issue since I became aware of and reported it, does not inspire any confidence in them being able to tend to a MMO.  So for all the game's successes, it is sad that there is one failure that no amount of successes can smooth over, which is the deplorable behaviour of the development / moderation team in a MMO.
8624	1	a	Good crafting but dying community. Great fun to be had in the wastelands. Play it before it's gone.
8626	1	a	Not too bad of a game.
8628	1	a	When you start off on the game it might be a little hard but you'll get the hang of it. I'd recommend this game to MMO/Steampunk nerds
6254	0	a	Very sad i spent so much time on this game, which have a great potential but a waste in many ways:  1) To get to the maxium level, you need to do a infinite number of quests wich are trash and its all about grindgrind and grind, however there is another (hidden) way to level up, wich is some funny raid you must do over and over, surviving hordes, but the game dosent tell you, this should be the way to level up default, not trash questing.  2) Can't reset talents. -0,5  3) Trash style: i hate that trash style to drop trash and craft stuff.   4) If you level up any other weapon oriented character then pistols, you are done in pvp.  PVP=pistols, the rest equals to death in pvp. -3.0  5) Hitbox advantage: you make a small tiny girl character and you are impossible to hit. -0,5  6) If you haven't done 4 and 5 you can't play pvp. You must be a female pistol user or you are going to get destroyed. (i suggest the developers to fix this in this way: make a character which is bigger have more hp or be more resistent and enhance the other weapons, so they can catch up with pistols)  only pro's: atmosphere  decent combat  my opinion: VOTE 4.0/10
8630	1	a	its is a good game needs improvement on the graphics
6255	0	a	This game is complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t i can't even get into the game for 2seconds whithout it freezing and crashing my computer
6256	0	a	Play this if you hate life and like wasting time on nonsense.
8632	1	a	♥♥♥♥.  I just took a ♥♥♥♥ only to find out I had been sleeping all along, and now my bedsheets are white. But that's not important. What's important is the ♥♥♥♥ing ingenius gameplay mechanic of Fallout4-- I mean Fallen Earth.  My stomach feels like a burning oven, so I'll do my best to meticulously state all of the positive and negative aspects of this machieavellean distopic future, wherein society has gone to ♥♥♥♥, and so has the better portion of my underwear.  Combat---&gt; ♥♥♥♥ing, melee headshots and first person fisting, dual wield your mom while you get sucked off Story----&gt; You're sent from Christian Bale into the past to go ♥♥♥♥ yourself, intriguing monologue sequences that really penetrate the viewer. the ♥♥♥♥ing LEVELLING----&gt; what's not to like? you can buff your unstuck, while jerking off with cold touch. Final Verdict------&gt; 20 Hiroshimas out of 1 Boston Bombing
8634	1	a	this is a huge incredible crazy game :D
8636	1	a	Nice game but a lot of people are trolling. :/
8638	1	a	I love the open world and freedom to be what you want to be with no restrictions. kinda takes me back to the ol' commodor 64 wasteland game only in fps mode. great game for sure.
6257	0	a	i can't login my fallen earth.... 
6258	0	a	Honestly boring, nothing much else can be said. Maybe this game just wasn't for me.
8640	1	a	Seems like a good game, if your computer can handle it...
6260	0	a	TL;DR: Have you ever played an MMO? This is an MMO. It plays like an MMO with a lot of limitations. Unless you have lots of patience. Hours worth. Days worth.  Looking at this game after some time has passed, I realized that I fell into an MMO trap.  This game is actually not that great if you like action games. You spend a lot of time doing a lot of nothing. Crafting, gathering, grinding. I don't recommend this for people that like action, just buy New Vegas and mod it. Or wait for H1Z1 to come out, or buy that. Or wait for the Mad Max game. Or put a small dev team together and make an interesting game similar to this.
8642	1	a	Good game until you reach a certain level that the game becomes to repetitive and you loose interest.
8644	1	a	great game ! graphic wise and enjoyed the player interactions
8646	1	a	crash central
6262	0	a	wtf is this
8648	1	a	A game with great concept, great community, fun to play, a decent levelling system and some great mmo style timesinks. Similar to Fallout 3 if you were playing whilst another million ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ were playing. It does feel like another game using the source engine which is sad. If it were smoother and prettier and had sexier graphics I would play it 24/7 and poop sock all day. But hey if you're using a toaster, go on ahead.
8650	1	a	its ok, the controls are a little hard to get use to 
8652	1	a	A good Post-apocalyptic game.  Sorta confusing and not knowing what to do at first but you get there.  Haven't spent much time on it but it's a good game.
8654	1	a	A lot to do for a new player. Very much like an online, not-so-gore-filled version of Fallout. As a F2P it is expected to be a heavy grinder or Pay for Premium deal. Where you can grind and spend more time to craft, level up abilities, and travel from place to place in game as opposed to a Premium member, but it makes up for it in pure in-game content and a fun post-apocalyptice free-to-play MMO-RPG. Bored often? Create a Fallen Earth account.
8656	1	a	tis cool mang
6266	0	a	i beta tested this game it was buggy then. i bought it played for a few weeks. quit because nothing was getting fixed. came back after it went free to play. an the same bugs an the laggy areas where still there. the only thing that changed was . they had change some of the areas too look different.
8658	1	a	PS2 graphics...  WoW harvesting mechanics and a little more detail than WoW crafting.  The controls were made by a 5 year old... if you have a multi-button mouse a good scroll wheel and you don't mind pressing Tab every 5 seconds it's not that bad.  The combat mechanics are sluggish, ranged weapons are the way to go as anything melee doesn't hit even though your weapon passes right through them.  Most of it is like as if WoW and EVE Online had a baby that was missing a limb or two &gt;.&lt;  It takes at least the first couple missions to get over the learning curve of the game mechanics and controls, other than what I mentioned at the start it gets better quickly... you also get a mount (horse) right at the starter area so it's great for exploration.  I'll be playing more of this game to see how far I can get in it without it being dullified otherwise I would recommend this to anyone who want's an WoW/EVE Online game experience, yes it takes real-time to craft things, it takes 'Skill Books', you are a clone, you have to mine/salvage minerals to craft... it's all pretty much an EVE Online game made 3rd/1st Person shooter.
6270	0	a	♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥♥!!!
8660	1	a	this game is so soothing in a way because you do have to be all sad about choosing classes when you can make your own
8662	1	a	Disclaimer: My hours do not reflect how much time I have spent on this game because I was playing it long before it was on Steam. I used to pay around $12 or so to play every month and it was absolutely worth it.  The reviews for this game really aren't that great. But you should give this game a try. It's a really fun game to just play by yourself and the quests are quite enjoyable. The community is fun when you actually see people (since not that many play anymore) and the developers are really fun as well.   I remember when they used to do trivia nights down in the bunkers and I actually won 1,000 chips (or 10 red chips) which is a lot of money on there. The environment is actually pretty fun. It's sad to see that so many people have given it a bad review because it's such a fun game to play.   And I see the other side of this argument. The game kinda looks like ♥♥♥♥ and the game mechanics aren't that great. It's one of those things where you really just have to play it to understand why people enjoy it. And you can't just quit after like the first hour of playing or so. Once you get on your feet and start crafting stuff it becomes really enjoyable.   I always try to talk my friends into playing it but all they can say is that they heard it was ♥♥♥♥.
8664	1	a	I love the game it reminds me of a cross between the steam punk and another scfifi game that i use to play. I love it now that i got the hang of the controls.  Would love it even more if you could put your horse away after you summon it, rather than leave it to be killed.
8666	1	a	the one good thing about it not being high quality is that its not very laggy
8668	1	a	Amazing Roleplaying game with a TON of action, combat, and crafting involved. It's like minecraft meets skyrim then gets in a nuclear war.
6276	0	a	Ok sooooo, I installed went to play and it asks you to create an account. No problem lets do that. Wait, it is saying I already have  1......what?  I have never played this so how do I......ok let me attempt guessing it. Nope, not happening, so I try doing a password reset. IT WORKED, maybe now I can ♥♥♥♥ing play this game already. But wait.....what is my username associated to that password? I try everything I could think of, Steam name, E-mail and random usernames I usually use. Nope, nothing, nada, zip, zilch. I give up ♥♥♥♥ THIS GAME, UNINSTALLED. You know you have wasted your time installing when the game doesn't even want you to play it.
8670	1	a	Fallen Earth could be better but it's still not a bad MMO to play to get away from more mainstream MMO's.
8672	1	a	Its not bad.. its actually good but it has a problem.. you need company to play this game or else you get bored... would recommend for parties! :D
8674	1	a	Great game.
8676	1	a	Well if you like fallout you like this
6280	0	a	Good thing downloading the game takes only a few weeks, i thought it would be so much longer. Oh nvm jk theres more to download after downloading the game
6281	0	a	They would not give me a motorbike 0/10  but in all seriousness this game is horrible.
8678	1	a	Not exactly a unique game. An alternative to the Fallout series.  It's pretty fun starting out.  As your level gets higher, you find yourself alone most of the time. The maps are so incredibly large; it can be a pain in the ♥♥♥ sometimes.
8680	1	a	Even though i havent had the game for long i still think its great. Good old fasion PvE with some PvP zones, love it. Good crafting mechanics, quests, lvls, and fighting AI. In my opinion i would give this game an 8/10.
8682	1	a	Fast-paced, fun, and definately intresting. This game provides many elements and game styles that most newer games lack. This MMO is a must play.
6282	0	a	don't bother to download, this game is unplayable  i don't know if the server is laggy or the game is glitchy but i can't even hit an enemy in the tutorial mode (the enemy still can hit me), and the animation is so slow. if you have bunch of bandwidth and time to waste, you might want to try it by yourself.
8684	1	a	It is the MMO Fallout I was waiting for. The game does feel like the fallout game, but with more MMO approach to it. It is really fun. So bring your friends to the mad world of the Fallen Earth and get to the top of the remaining wasteland! The game does have a few draw back because of the MMO approach, but you can look past them. Melee does not feel as good, it feels like your standard MMO, but when using ranged it turn into a TPS or FPS! Final rating: 6/10. The game does feel like your Apocalyptic Wasteland Survivial game, but it have a lot of bad MMO things to it, so the game is not that great because of them.
6284	0	a	This is the worst game I've ever played.  Some Highlights: -When I jump, I can't move around or even look in a different direction until I've landed (about 3 seconds later).  -To switch weapons once, I have to press Ctrl+3, wait 3 or 4 seconds so the game doesn't crash, and then press Ctrl+4. --Combat is essentially just a calculator. Enemies hit regardless of where you are. For example: I sneak around the edge of a room so I'm behind an enemy. He's facing comepletly the other direction, but right before I'm close enough to hit him, he shouts and swings his weapon, still facing the other direction, and I take 2 damage. He slowly turns to face me while frantically swinging his cartooney baseball bat. I try strafing and dodging forward and backwards but he hits me no matter what, so I resign myself to clicking on him over and over. He dies quickly, having dealt a total of 11 damage to me. I go to the next room where the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥ 'robotic' female voice acting (that sounds like it was recorded with a $1 goodwill mic) directs me to kill another identical enemy. I do the same thing a few more times, and every single enemy does 11 damage to me before I kill them because THERE'S NO WAY TO DODGE ATTACKS!   The entire fighting system could be summarized to 'Which is greater? (your health/enemy dps) or (enemy health/your weapon's dps)'
6285	0	a	this game is bull s*** the aming machanic sucks gees I RECOMMEND YOJO SIM OVER THIS i hate that to
8686	1	a	HELLS YEAH I WAS WAITING FOR THIS TO GO F2P
8688	1	a	I do enjoy this game but nearly impossible to do alone. I have no friends to play this g ame with but if i did it would have been 100X easier and 1000X more fun. Post apocolyptic world where you can gather materials to craft everything from arms and armor to ATVs and motorcycles. You can craft any where but its faster in the crafting buildings set for that item set; but its nearly impossible to farm and make everything you want but again with friends its not hard.Overall Great game IMO
8690	1	a	Nice little crafting based MMO. Kind of addicting.
6287	0	a	It won't even let me sign up for an account. Great job.
8692	1	a	This game...isn't the greatest, but it still holds a special place in my heart(as one of my first games on here. Play for an hour or two(or don't) simply because it's free.
8694	1	a	It is a good game.
6289	0	a	IT'S PAY TO WIN!
6290	0	a	First 5 minute review. 3rd party authentication (email collector/spam sender/downloader) ...hours of updates and 'collating data' after installing from steam. Couldn't even make it though the tutorial it was so bad.
8696	1	a	Great community, out of the ordinary universe, great game overall,despite the ocasional bugs
8698	1	a	BEST GAME EVER I PLAYED this game have 30 fps on old computer best game ever
8700	1	a	i have played this game for over 400+ hours in non steam it is a insanly fun game when you have people..... if you do then your set, no classes to pick its up to you to do so
8702	1	a	I love crafting systems. Man, do I ever love good crafting systems in game. And what better then a game about the post apocolyse to really shine in this department? There is nothing quite as rewarding as savaging through mounds of garbage, collecting various long rusted do-dads, and long forgotten whats-its to make various deadly weapons to gut, barrage, or otherwise eviscerate various pus drooling mutants.  Okay, so the crafting is still varily limited. But compared to most MMORPGS it is still rather 'up there' on the scale of awesome. Combine that with real time FPS combat (which still boils down to a-typical pulling and grinding, admitably) and you got yourself some fun times.  The game is rather graphic intensive, but after kicking the graphics down even my laptop with it's outdated drivers and such was capable of running it releatively smoothly. Grab a friend, get your horse and hit the waste! It's time to launch your career as a down and dirty, gun toting scavager!
8704	1	a	Fun game I recommend it because it will keep you busy for hours and its like a poor mans Fallout
8706	1	a	Great MMO with a very Fallout-esc feel, give it a try ^^
8708	1	a	pretty cool but the graphics failed a little bit i have the graphics in high and still looks a little bad but its pretty f*cking good i recomend this game to everyone who likes post-apocaliptics game of survival....
8710	1	a	a Fantastic post apocalyptic mmorpg. one of the greatest crafting/skill systems ive ever seen. Very easy to understand. Immensly complicated for new users i would say you should ask for help in chat all the time. in any case at least once every ten seconds.   10/10 would craft again.
8712	1	a	This is an awesome game i played it many times and it RULES !!!!
6295	0	a	updates take a year ...
8714	1	a	this game first was a good game with some brilliant concepts now it has matured into a fantastic game with a lot of deapth and good multiplay. A real classic for its type and free to play a must have in the goodies cupboard
8716	1	a	A really fun post-apocolyptic mmorpg that involves quite the amount of mechanics, however this game is not very fun solo, well neither is any mmo. I would recommend this f2p mmo for just how fun it is in the first place even in solo, I would of course enjoy to have more friends play the game and making it easier to find them (you'll be surprised how hard it is to find your friend). I also enjoy the fact that it has a night and day cycle, but too many microtransactions (of course) makes the gameplay less apealing to those who doesn't want to 'waste' money on a f2p game, but at the end of the day, it still remains to be a fun game to play.
8718	1	a	This is a really god post apoctalyptic MMO.Its often fun and interesting especialy if your playing with some friends.Its like a mashup of fallout 3,minecraft and an MMO.Its a fun game and i would give it a 9 out of 10 and i recommend it.
8720	1	a	This game is like realy good I LOVE IT!
8722	1	a	Hard for me to say yes or no on this game. It was fun, an interesting concept that runs adequately (sorta), the faction system was awesome, but ultimately, it's free, so the only thing you'll waste is time if you don't like it. It was fun while it lasted. No instanced zones, so it can be a mess at times, but it's fun to some degree. Does what it sets out to do in one way or another. If you wanna see a unique MMO, play this game. It is very unique. Sub-par, but unique.
6296	0	a	Pretty bad game. The quests are simply farming, not to mention the uncreative and buggy interface.
8724	1	a	If you have nothing to do, got a couple hours spare a day, or wanna try something new? Try this, it truely is an amazing experience, altho the game takes time to get used too, and actually be worthwhile, when you get to a good stage, the game is purely amazing, altho, i have only played 4 hours myself, i plan on playing alot more. I got this game yesterday, and have played it in all my spare time. And, for a FREE game, its perfect.
6298	0	a	Got it simply cuz it looked like an online Fallout .. didn't care for it.
8726	1	a	this is a really good game, but its long and confusing
6300	0	a	Bad graphics and buggy engine. Combat is glitchy and uninteresting. Don't bother.
8728	1	a	The game is interesting and wide open. There are hardly any players so it frees up the map for legitimate exploration and self made RP in a post apocolyptic world in which you must work to grow and develop. It lacks quite a lot of engaging content and you will spend much of your time standing around in some broken down building watching long timers tick away while you craft items.   It seems the developers decided to focus mainly on the pvp aspects of the game, and while they did create a long and involved crafting process they didn't give a lot of purpose to the game beyond simply hunting each other down. The game would of seriously benefited from Story depth and background PVE world development. Walking around the world is almost empty except for near cities and small compounds where you find NPC's with broken AI, No real engaging dialogue although occasionally you'll catch a funny one liner here or there, Laggy systems for an empty game its funny how often everything will simply stall out and fail completely....There is nothing but open long range views of empty landscapes outside of the cities.  I am currently only re-installing the game because I want the achievements I can get, my suggestion if you're planning to play is to turn off chat so you dont have to listen to the political-woman bashing-general absurdity-childish arguing-micromanaging ego tripped self appointed chat nazis who will try to tell you where and when to talk while they themselves engage in some of the redundant rediculous conversations I've been forced to witness,,,,so as I was saying, turn off chat, play the game for what it's worth, you dont really need anyone except for the instances and if you go back to them after you've leveled you wont even need that assistance at all, make friends on a person by person basis and otherwise treat the game like a single player open world sandbox fallout look and feel game. It's really fun if you're not looking for hyper exciting gameplay, engaging combat or extensive story.
8730	1	a	Found granola bar in a barrel of water 10/10
6302	0	a	so far i havent even gotten the game to properly update -.- im shure many people have had that problem where u gotta uninstall the game and re download it again atleast once.. whell heres my third shot at it and so far im getting really disapointed wondering if the game will even work!
8732	1	a	This game is a very wide open sandbox style MMO with fully developed content, unique systems, and a skill system that offers some of the most dynamic gameplay I have seen. Strategy is at no loss here, as each weapon system and skill set has a unique strategy to take advantage of in your adventures, whether it be PVP or PVE. I strongly recommend players giving this game a try.
8734	1	a	A very good post apocolypse mmo. next to swtor the best free to play out there.
8736	1	a	All of my YES
6303	0	a	so laggy, such buggy, such atmosphere...  wow.
8738	1	a	ver y ver y very good game i'd class it as A 'Sandbox' mmo witch are ma favroute type of games 'sandox' ones exept in strategy games lol
8740	1	a	THIS GAEM U CAN CAFT ANYTHING
8742	1	a	Awesome game to play with friends!
8744	1	a	Amazing gameplay (also free to play). Okay graphics...
8746	1	a	damn this is a good game!!!
6304	0	a	Community was atrocious. Immediately killed by other users. Scolded for accidentially using caps and then harassed.
8748	1	a	only played alittle but it seems like a great game with loads to do and lots of potential
6305	0	a	looked forward to playing co op in this game, totally not worth it. Game play was ok but there were too many idiots spoiling it for everyone else, deleted.
8750	1	a	Good fun. Best MMO out IMO  Edit 2014  This game is/was a hell of a lot of fun, don't let the time spent fool you, I played this before it was on Steam for hours. Found a great clan. Killed lots of mutants and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. I was a master crafter and went the entire game without choosing factions - wasn't easy, mind you.   All that fun came at a cost. It seems that my wife didn't like this game and she didn't like the clan I was in and didn't like to hear us talk on chat. As a matter of a fact, she hated it so much that she left me. Unlike the wastes, my marriage, it seems, cannot be tamed.   I think I'm done with MMO's
8752	1	a	Very fun with friends otherwise don't spend the time. 
8754	1	a	Hands down, one of my all time favorite game, and the only game that I ever addict to. Maybe it's because I started playing a week before summer start, but I still played 480 hours or 20 days in one summer... lol
8756	1	a	Great game. Lots of fun things to do, huge area to explore.
6306	0	a	This game actually sucks. I thought it would be really cool but ended up having a game-freezing bug every time a door opened. 1/10
8758	1	a	This game isn't half bad; honestly I thought it was going to have the same or similar graphics as LOTRO but it surpassed my expecation of such. The keys and buttons are kinda hard to learn when you are so used to a certain system of keys, but once you get the hang of it the fights can go smoothly.
6307	0	a	This game is complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t i can't even get into the game for 2seconds whithout it freezing and crashing my computer
8760	1	a	Badassery at its highest. With the right perking, you can be a terror of PvP
8762	1	a	Free 2 Play and not a Pay 2 Win! The 'buy now' sticker can be moved off the screen by the way.  But yeah though, I had my fun with this game, it was actually pretty great up untill you start getting into Territory Control (TC) where the map is constantly ruled by the Travelers because nothing beats Dual Pistols simply because every disadvantage a pistol is supposed to have, simply doesn't exsist oh sure they argue 'Duh huh huh ammos expansive tho'  Not when you have 40+ Chip harvesters pumping out a constant line of red chips for you. Play the game but dont get into the PVP unless you want to use dual pistols.
8764	1	a	Nice MMORPG :) IF you like Fallout you will like this.
8766	1	a	I would definatley recomend this MMO to anyone who is tired of the turn based, cooldown timer traditional mmo. This game is entirley realtime combat, freeroamed enviroment, beautifully rendered, and of course crafting and scavenging are realistic and common, making it easy to level up. Also the crafting is immense! You can craft your own vehicles, wepaons, armor, medications, and even your own campsite to set up around the wasteland. Another plus is mounts, there are a variety of horses, (for beginning users, you can get your first horse within, about... half an hour of play time) Also there are ATV's Motorcycles, Dune Buggys, Choppers (the long motorcycles), and sports cars, all of which are craftable. Yet I'm not going to glamorize the game and leave out all the cons. Some cons of the game are as follows: If you are new to the game and plan on getting a motorcycle/atv/car and don't level up your dexterity+coordination, it will be far to late to do anything about it and takes insanely long to bring it up to 25-35. Also the crafting times are insane, such as: Motorcycle Control System: 4 hours, that's a bit insane don't ya think? Althought the flipside is you can buy those off auctions for a reasonable price. So overall I give it a 9/10! Defiantley would send to anyone.
8768	1	a	I really like the concept in this game. You are in a post-apocaliptic world filled with many types of mutants.  The only downside really is that you have to have internet Connection to play it, and is incredible laggy if you have a slow internet.
8770	1	a	I love this game
6310	0	a	if this is really the closest thing to a fallout mmo than i rather bethesda not even try.
8772	1	a	Great game with a friendly and helpful players and GM's. Fallout style setting, EVE style crafting system, and an interesting storyline to back it all up.
8774	1	a	Its a very good game but very laggy on my low spec pc!
8776	1	a	WHY IT FREEZZZEEEZ FOR MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE if I enter to a romm in the tutorial?
6314	0	a	why i cant do account that is problem
8778	1	a	My friend found this game just scrolling through the Free to Play games one day and I am so glad he did. I probably would've never seen it if he wasn't just looking. This game is amazing! I love Fallout and this game has many themes that feel just like Fallout does, and it adds multiplayer to the game. Just got it last night and we played for 8 hours straight! amazing game!
6315	0	a	sucks
8780	1	a	was fun while it lasted, quit because lack of friends to play with
8782	1	a	great game would defenitly recommend this to friends
6316	0	a	game wouldn't let me change my username and when i went to go log in the game kicked me from the launcher.
8784	1	a	Fallen Earth is a futuristic romp through a war-torn post-apocalyptic wasteland packed full of fantastic features such as skippable cinematics, people that shoot at you, mutated chickens that do not look like mutated chickens at all, and lead pipes that you can hit these mutated chickens with for not looking like mutated chickens.   One of the most disorientating features I noticed was the nostalgic UI ripped from the mid-90s. Well great now all I want to do is play Furcadia again. I should have just went and installed Furcadia and I could have played as a dogtaur and barked at cat people or something cool. My friend and I spent a good while learning how to better cooperate as we tried to work together against the game’s nonexistent group quest tracking features, but not too long after came the highlight of our night when we both logged out of the game and went to sleep.    So is this the Fallout 3 Online we’ve all been waiting for? Yes. Your search is over. Fallen Earth is basically the popular post-apocalyptic roleplaying game Fallout 3 by Bethesda, if Fallout 3 were a massive online piece of ♥♥♥♥. That is Fallen Earth. So if you like to play games online and have them toss pieces of ♥♥♥♥ at you in your livingroom you should install this game. It’s pretty much free. Free pieces of ♥♥♥♥ thrown at you for free. Enjoy.
8786	1	a	This game is ultimately fun and unique.  The trouble for most players is that they can't get past the rather complicated beginning, as the mechanics of this game are not typical. However, once you get used to the crafting system, the character construction system, and the many other factors of this game, Fallen Earth instantly becomes a great addition to your collection. I don't regret a single one of my 322 hours logged on this game.
6318	0	a	You see Ivan, When play Fallen Earth like I,  You become good game reviewer, For fear of playing a horrid game like this again.
6319	0	a	Attempts no improvements on the MMO formula
8788	1	a	This game is really fun with friends
8790	1	a	Loved it two years ago, and love it still. Great game, love the combat system, skill tree, and the community. Can get annoying when getting stuck on a rock, but nothing like a backstep then a jump to solve the problem haha. Highly Recommend the game to all MMO/Survival/RPG/Community-Lovers all around!
8792	1	a	its a free to play mmo, so there are some bugs, but other than that its good. free so try and see
6320	0	a	kinda dont like it but i did only play it for like an hour
8794	1	a	Fallen Earth. This game could be so much more than it is, and it is a lot. It is sad that development has fallen to a snail's pace. This game features one of the best crafting systems in an MMO, where almost everything has to be crafted and can be crafted by you. Since it has gone F2P, it has not been relegated to a P2W game, just P4C.
8796	1	a	It's great :3
8798	1	a	Same as all free to play games.....WILL NOT START FFS 
6321	0	a	Review Date: 1/5/2015  Back in 1999-2001 (When i was in middle school), the game I enjoyed at the time was Runescape. For those that wish to find a 'Fallout' experience, this is NOT it. I tried to get into it but I just couldn't. It is F2P, so by all means try it and I hope you enjoy it.   My favorite games throughout the years have been:  PC Diablo and Diablo 2 (The rest of the series sadly changed) Skyrim Series Final Fantasy Series Fallout Series  007 Goldeneye Counter Strike  Call of Duty Halo/Halo 2/Halo 3/Halo 5 (All other halo titles are the equivalent of Diablo 2 vs Diablo 3, im sure others would agree)  I hope a team of devs arrive with an endless budget and a total wow killer. I would like and would pay $60 for purchase and $5/month to $15/month for this.  Suspense (remember Resident Evil: Directors Cut?) Crafting  PVP separated from PVE (on same server, just a 'wasteland' area that is anything goes *high risk/high reward* A true shooter *halo/cod type controls* Eye Candy Graphix (computers are getting quite fast now, you can build a very decent server for a tenth of what it would of cost to perform the same just 4 years ago)  I suppose all you would have to do is get backed by Microsoft or Sony and make them sign on paper it will not release until it is polished enough for a very cheap or free beta. Once in beta, you have 1 year to make it bug/hacker free, then start adding content.  Do this and you will dominate the game market. 
6322	0	a	Honestly all I have to say is GamersFirst. Yeah, sure. Those guys are just trying to milk as much money from the Community of die-hard fans as possible before shutting the thing down. Game hasn't gotten ANY attention from the devs except for more micro-transactions.   Here's a micro-Transaction example: You can craft Cars in this game. And there is one really cool car. The fastest one with the biggest trunk and overall no other vehicle in the game is even close to beeing a competition to it. Now, if you want that car, you can craft for ages, hell, crafting the car takes ATLEAST 1 week, not farming the stuff for it, no, I mean the actual process of crafting it takes 1 Week. (Except if you pay real money you can boost it a really big ammount) The other way to get it is just to ♥♥♥♥ing buy it in the shop. Yay.   Also: Player customization. Character creation is ♥♥♥♥ and all characters look ugly as ♥♥♥♥. How do you fix an ugly Character? Awesome Clothing, you are absolutely right sir. Now when you first start the game, you notice the 'Wardrobe' slot in your gear-menu. Except the slots don't seem to work. huh. You have to buy the slots in PACKAGES. Or pay a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of money (I think it was arround 20 bucks) to get all of them.   And one of my absolute favourites is the endgame PvE: You have to buy an Shop-Item to summon the bosses. Yup. I just said it.   Not everything about the game is bad tho. It feels really rewarding when you build your first Dune buggy for example. I'm pretty sure you won't find any matches nowadays but I really had fun in PvP-Battlegrounds, atleast the Deathmatch one, but its Probably everyone using the exact same build in endgame.  It's for free, so check it out if you really want this to be good, but it's basically dead already.  And also read some other Reviews, everyone who's talking about the Enemy AI; the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Combat system or the boring Quests is absolutely right.
6323	0	a	Tried to like it.... Tried not to get bored.... Tried to explore....  One massive fail after another....
8800	1	a	This game is like fallout 
8802	1	a	i can't login,so i can't get on to atually play someone please help. t
8804	1	a	Hello, Now i dont really play to many MMOs but from learning and knowing alot about them i have some knowledge on them. This game is one of the best games ive played in a while. And yes i only have 5 hours into this game but so far it is a great game.   Weapons-There are a huge amount of weapons in fallen earth, weather its melee weapons like spiked bats or swords to guns like sniper rifles pistols and a bunch of other weapons.  Armor-There are a bunch of cloths and armor that you can get in the game which help protect yourself  Crafting-This is one of the big ones. There is alot of things to craft weather its crating ammo , weapons ,Armor , food , and a bunch of other things.  enemys-There are bunch of monsters and people that you will come across and kill. Theres bosses and alot of hard things to fight, but when you have the right gear and weapons some enemys will become easy to kill but there are alot of hard enemys that ly ahead.  Map-The map is giant! its broken up into sectors with different areas and biomes and you can come a across many things while you roam the land.  Friends-I like to play with friends this game is very fun with a group of friends and take out bosses , fortresses , etc...  PVP-Now i havent done or encountered this. but There are pvp areas all around the map huge areas to where you can kill other players build bases together raid peoples bases and have epic battles.  This is by far one of the best games ive ever played i give this 10/10  Hope to see you in the atomic wasteland! :)
8806	1	a	Fallen Earth, to me, is a must-have. It does what all the other people attempting to steal Fallout's glory tried to, and actually puts it in a really cool package. Free-to-play on here means, you can't do things as quickly as others that pay for things.  Examples of stuff to buy: Crafting Slots (have more than one item crafting while you're running around) Vehicles (can actually craft them in game, but this will literally take you weeks to pull off) Vanity BS!  So I mean, It really does not effect anything but your convenience. If you're like me, you like the idea of it taking you a couple of weeks to gather the materials to craft yourself a motorcycle. If you're not? Spend some cash and get you one. Honestly running around and gathering things, and crafting whatever I want to use myself without spending a bit of in game or real world currency, is why I love this game.  People I recommend this game to? Fallout fans. Survivalists. People that enjoy rich crafting systems, with a decent amount of customization to keep your things looking different from everyone elses.  I'm really not even that far into this game, and still getting the hang of a lot of the systems in it as it has a bit of a learning curve, but it's really not that hard to understand. If any of it sounds appealing, give the game a shot, Can't hurt, it's free after all!
8808	1	a	Love this game so much ive played it for 500 hours and I dont really like gaming :D 
8810	1	a	this game looks fun i think i might do a youtube video on this game
6324	0	a	i can't even login. so far it sucks for me!
6325	0	a	When I played this game for the first time I was amused. Do note I have never played a single fallout game, but if you're looking for that I have a hunch you wont find it here.  The game is more of an MMORPG with an apocolypse skin. Microtransactions help a lot as well, almost too much. (Bigger inventory, etc.)   After spending about 8-10 hours leveling you will find things get very excessively difficult. I recall playing a TANK and having to heal after every fight despite having a leveling partner landing headshots over and over again. The name of the game becomes kiting and I was pretty much put in a spot where I felt useless. Once NPC's have guns, forget it unless you have a party. They don't miss. Ever.  The leveling system is stupid and punishes you for not knowing what you're doing at the start.  I would give the game a 6/10, I've for sure played worse. It has aged poorly, though. Wouldn't bother now. Much better choices out there.
8812	1	a	On a scale 1 to 10 I'd rate this at 8.5
8814	1	a	the game is good i had a character who was one of the leaders of a notorious gang we rekt at pvp , i love the sniping action the game might look crap but the feeling is wow
8816	1	a	well let me start out with saying...  when i first tried to login it didn't work so yeah i used 2 hours to try and fix it.  then i went to the loading screen it took FOREVER. and the graphics looks like it was made in 2007 but the gameplay worked fine so i would say... 5/10 
8818	1	a	its ok
8820	1	a	Ok this is a good game by the looks its like fallout just with worst grafics and difrent stroy. WARNING: Theres alout of downloading! I really think I should of got this when it came out. Peace.
8822	1	a	it is like fallout but is is multiplayer and free to play
8824	1	a	10/10 better then rune of world craft 2: mists of armagedden gold eddition 
8826	1	a	Post Apocalyptic MMO that all Fallout, Elder Scrolls payer will like, so far havent seen anything wrong with this!! :) Graphics: 7/10 Gameplay: 8/10 Storyline: 8/10 Difficulty at Start of Game: Moderatly Difficult, Tutorial a little general.  
8828	1	a	The world of fallen earth is a trecherous one! With enemies around every corner, you better watch your back at all times, or be killed faster than you can say 'fallen'.  The Pros- -A huge expansive world with much to do, and see -many choices on character development -This game has vehicles that you can drive &amp; and animals you can ride -The Missions can sometimes flow together very nicely -You can choose what you do, what missions to take/what not to do (all faction missions effect the opposing faction's respect for you) -Many different styles too choose from -You can use a market to purchase anything from other players (which is helpful if you're looking for an upgrade you can't find. - The Cons-  -since the map is really large, you will be spending most of your time driving for 20 minutes to get to the next town. -The learning curve is very steep, and takes time to master. -Most missions are basic. Example: 'go too the next town and kill some of the vista's for us' Refer to first con I stated -This game is VERY Pay2Win, with a Chip (currency) cap of 10000, you can't get very far without paying for an item, (which, depending on what you buy, can be very cheap, or expensive.) -You start off really overwhelmed by enemies, A basic level 2 will kill you in only a couple well placed hits -The progression system can make, or break your experience. If you don't level up, just right. and pick the right things, You will be completely overwhelmed by enemies later in the game  Even despite the cons, Fallen Earth Is an enjoyable experience and has entertained me for hours apon hours of entertainment. The story had me questioning everything that happened ( even though predictable at times) You should note, This game is Not for everyone, The learning curve is only for the faint of heart, and the difficulty is Very hard at lower levels. New players be warned.
6327	0	a	Cmon steam why do i have to make an account to get in?I expect a good game where i dont have to sign into everything.
8830	1	a	Just another boring old MMO right? WRONG!! This game is absolutely uh not that addictive tho but it is decent.The most decent game I had ever played.The game started in a wasteland where you are a clone.If you had played Fallout before then the game is a bit similar to this except this is an MMO.The game is really fun to play with especially the blood sport.The blood sport is a PVP arena where you play Team DeathMatch,Capture the Flag and so on.The best part is this game is not I repeat NOT PAY 2 WIN!! You can basically get anything you want in this game using the in-game currency which is 'chips'.The community is really helpful and not annoying at all.If you need any help in the game you should just ask in the chat and one of the members will help you out.They are all friendly in the game.This game deserve 7/10
8832	1	a	Guys, i recomand this game because is a post-Apocaliptic survival game and is a massive multyplayer game
6328	0	a	Bad: The controls are super weird and annoying until you change them, The graphics aren't the best but thats fine, looting is annoying, I also dont understand why we need to see all our skills at the bottom when we can just hit Y (default enteract button) to activate the thing, and you really need to pay attention in the start or else you won't under stand a thing which I really hate  Good: The story isn't bad, everyone is preaty nice, dosn't lag like crazy, and its free.
8834	1	a	THIS GAME IS THE BOMB! I love it soo much. It's a hardcore MMORPG! Its a good RPG because it takes along time to beat it. Ive been playing for a month and im only a level 8. Might seem like it sucks, but it doesnt. Its not like COD or fallout where you pick your stats when you level up. You earn AP for doing stuff. AP can be used to select your stats if you just have leveled up, or when ever! Also the game has alot of missions. It keeps you strapped to your seat. I love the crafting system. Its just so cool and keeps you looking for bits and doodads. You can also get cars, atv, dune buggies, and horses. You can get pets also! So far I have a Axe, Golfclub, air rifle, dual .357 magnums, dual crude shivs, and dual metal plumbing pipes. Those are my weapons. I also have a old nag as a horse. 1/10 scale i would rate it 9/10. Has good everything except that it takes forever to get a veichle. Also the servers can lag and some missions aren't playable unless you restart. I RECOMMEND THIS!!!!
8836	1	a	Great game nuff said
8838	1	a	love this game! 
8840	1	a	If you like Post-Apocalyptic games and MMOs... Then you'll love this game, It's a bit like an MMO mixed with Shooter game, mixed with a apocalyptic game!   9/10 Graphics are great but not the best.
8842	1	a	Great game to play. I have to be honest, the begining is very boring because its hard to overcome easy obstacles. But once you get going, it gets amazing and really fun. I recommend this to patient players.
6330	0	a	Got it simply cuz it looked like an online Fallout .. didn't care for it.
8844	1	a	this is a really good game, but its long and confusing
6331	0	a	Sadly i got bored. :) Linear game..
8846	1	a	i would definintly recomend this game u can do almost anthing in it and if ur a fallout fan this is 4 u
8848	1	a	nice game but the graphics aint good so if you dont care about graphics play it and its free
8850	1	a	I'd recommend this game to anyone its got a great concept for a mmo that you just don't see in most post-apocalyptic survival games.
8852	1	a	its like fallout3 and gta had a babby 
8854	1	a	So you like mad max huh? so you think u can handle the end of times?  Like mounts (cars or horses?)  Enjoy!  It's great.
6332	0	a	♥♥♥♥ this game
8856	1	a	this game is absolutely fun if you have been looking for a free 2 play fallout game has its rpg elements and is multiplayer so u can have fun with your friends!!!! :)
6334	0	a	It is a good game but not for me.  If you want to try an open world RPG game then you would like to try this game!  Don't ask me about the graphics because it's horrible. But hey! The gameplay is always on top of that.   WELL GG!
8858	1	a	good game needs more enemys follow me on instagram #zachchannel
8860	1	a	Really great game, but i fail to understand the negative review..
8862	1	a	Very good mmorpg for those who like post-apocalyptic gaming. Crafting system is excellent and lot of options how to gear up.
6336	0	a	Ok sooooo, I installed went to play and it asks you to create an account. No problem lets do that. Wait, it is saying I already have  1......what?  I have never played this so how do I......ok let me attempt guessing it. Nope, not happening, so I try doing a password reset. IT WORKED, maybe now I can ♥♥♥♥ing play this game already. But wait.....what is my username associated to that password? I try everything I could think of, Steam name, E-mail and random usernames I usually use. Nope, nothing, nada, zip, zilch. I give up ♥♥♥♥ THIS GAME, UNINSTALLED. You know you have wasted your time installing when the game doesn't even want you to play it.
8864	1	a	Fallen Earth could be better but it's still not a bad MMO to play to get away from more mainstream MMO's.
8866	1	a	*SQUAWK*
8868	1	a	I have cancer this game has not changed anything recommend definitley
8870	1	a	Good fun. Best MMO out IMO  Edit 2014  This game is/was a hell of a lot of fun, don't let the time spent fool you, I played this before it was on Steam for hours. Found a great clan. Killed lots of mutants and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. I was a master crafter and went the entire game without choosing factions - wasn't easy, mind you.   All that fun came at a cost. It seems that my wife didn't like this game and she didn't like the clan I was in and didn't like to hear us talk on chat. As a matter of a fact, she hated it so much that she left me. Unlike the wastes, my marriage, it seems, cannot be tamed.   I think I'm done with MMO's
8872	1	a	This game is like realy good I LOVE IT!
8874	1	a	Hard for me to say yes or no on this game. It was fun, an interesting concept that runs adequately (sorta), the faction system was awesome, but ultimately, it's free, so the only thing you'll waste is time if you don't like it. It was fun while it lasted. No instanced zones, so it can be a mess at times, but it's fun to some degree. Does what it sets out to do in one way or another. If you wanna see a unique MMO, play this game. It is very unique. Sub-par, but unique.
6338	0	a	Pretty bad game. The quests are simply farming, not to mention the uncreative and buggy interface.
8876	1	a	If you want a Fallout like MMORPG then this is your game.
8878	1	a	Not a bad game, it is free to play so of course the better items cost money to buy. Just like the turbine games such as Lord of the Rings and Dungeons and Dragons. Other than that fault, the game is just about like any other MMO. This one has a Fallout taste to it being set in a post apocalypse world. The main down side is the crafting can take a lot of time to do unless you pay to remove the limit.
8880	1	a	Its awesome, It has a sense of realism, and best of all, Its FREE.
8882	1	a	It's a great game... when you figure out what you're doing half the time.
6340	0	a	Everything bad about world of warcraft, a poorly executed wasteland setting, bland and unappealing graphics. Stuffed in a broken game engine, shaken around till it looses all sense of direction, served with a juvenile playerbase.  Dont even bother.
6341	0	a	Seems fun at start but when you go out to the wastland for the first time all the people kill you.
8884	1	a	damn good game great community best part is they ban trolls
8886	1	a	Good game for a free to play, not top of the food chain but enjoyable
8888	1	a	It a great game once you get used to the crafting time and all that.The idea of having the world destroyed in the future is great.You can make weapons,melee weapons,ATV,Cars,Medicine,and anything else.You can also add friends,duel with people.team up to do missions.I would have to say this is the game I would want people to choose if they like Future MMO games.
8890	1	a	#recommendthisgame♥♥♥♥♥es
6344	0	a	I want that hour of my life back, this game is ♥♥♥♥. Comparing this game to Fallout should be punishable by law!
8892	1	a	Fallen Earth is a post-apocalyptic MMO. It feels just like Fallout. For the game being F2P it is amazing. The game has numerous quest and helpful staff. I think it is fun, overall i give it a 10/10
8894	1	a	its a free to play mmo, so there are some bugs, but other than that its good. free so try and see
6345	0	a	I dont like this game its really B mmorpg
8896	1	a	It's great :3
8898	1	a	It only took about 5 minutes to hate this game but I gave it a few hours. Dont make the same mistake I did.
6346	0	a	This game is a bad game, a very bad game. Stahp.
8900	1	a	well, its a free game and if you take that in consideration the game is not that bad. Yes the mechanics of the games are wierd and it is not your typical shooter responsive type game. Is more about exploring and killing a lot of time in your hand, if you have it. That is my problem that I only have with the game. I do not have the time. It is very difficult to learn and it takes a lot of time for you to level your self up and such. But, in the end this is a free game. By default that is a plus in my book.
8902	1	a	Just wish I could play it on GNU/Linux. Then I could finally leave Windows behind.
8904	1	a	The game looks like a little boring or repetitive at the begin if you dont know what to do ,but after the initial missions, you start doing some missions, finding some cool people, and getting better, the game is recommended for people who play in group/team, just playing or roleplaying, in a huge sandbox map ,with hundred of new adventures.   *note* if you play alone but want someone to play with, try get in a clan or look for people at social networks or at the game forum.
6348	0	a	Fallen Earth - is that even for a wild f**king? Fallout Online? Well, Islamic nun is more similar to Fallout Online! 0/10 - it's just some kind of horror, with terrible graphics, awkward controls, and even curve as ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s aged legs! It's not a game. It's a very very good ♥♥♥♥.
8906	1	a	The closest thing to a Fallout MMO currently available, this game has some really neat ideas.
8908	1	a	This game look epic so i got it but it slowly ♥♥♥♥ing updating actully it updating alot This looook just like fallout 3 I WANT IT ANYTHING THAT LOOK LIKE FALLOUT 3 I WANT IT I ♥♥♥♥ING WANT IT
8910	1	a	10 out of 10, since it was released in 2009 still one of the best post-apocalyptic MMORPG of all time! I recommend for anyone who likes Fallout or similar games and for every people who wants a new taste of mmorpg! The graphics are not as the same as a new released mmorpg but the gameplay and the roleplay is magnificent! Try it out, and have fun!
8912	1	a	This mmo gives off a feel of Borderlands and Ryzom (Another, older, mmo. Google it.) smashed together. Skill system: 6/10  Personally, I like the skill system, however, I feel like it's tied to the single currency of AP too much. You need AP to raise mutation levels, skills, tradeskills, and stats. (Which take 5 AP points to raise a stat by 1.) The game offers sub-level ups, so you gain 3 AP points per sub-level up, and it happens multiple times before you actually go from level 1 to level 2. You can get a lot of AP points this way but they all drain out by the time you're done spending them. The ability system can also be steep, for example. I wanted to do sonic manipulation and empathy for my mutations. However, both of which take 43-48 points in empathy or sonic manipulation to get the first skill. That's a bit tough. Now add in your skills and stats, and disregard tradeskills. It makes it difficult to pick and choose what you need. With all this stuff going on, you really need to know what you want to do with your skills before you spend any. Combat: 4/10  Average hotbar combat with left click as attack and right to activate a spell or use your second gun/weapon if you're dual wielding. Headshots do more damage, etc. You have your standard Health, Stamina, and Gamma (mana) at your disposal in combat. Nothing special here. Gameplay: 7/10  I found the world immersive and fun to explore. There's tons of places to explore, however the constant need of awareness of danger kept me on my toes. There's a lot to do, and it can get pretty hectic when you accidentally get into the nasty mess of 5v1 combat. If you like post-apocalyptic worlds like this one, I think you'll like this game. The game is completely classless, too, so you can customize what you want to do; ranging from crafting, to guns blazing, to a post-apocalyptic ninja, etc. The only other MMO I saw this done was in Ryzom. Technical Stuff: 5/10  If you're looking for a pretty game, don't bother with this one. The game is sorta old and you don't even need an overkill PC to play it. There are some graphical issues (for me anyways) but they are minor and shouldn't impact the gameplay much. Some of the scenery hitboxes are a bit larger than they should be, and on a rare occasion, you might see an enemy run through walls, but it's pretty a solid game from a technical standpoint.  Final Average Rating: 5.5/10  Other Comments: The game is best played with friends. I don't recommend playing solo.
8914	1	a	If i remember correctly (It has been quite some time since i played this last) It was pretty good. Its basically skyrim on a ♥♥♥♥ budget and its glitchy sometimes but when it does work its pretty fun. You have to actually be smart with what you do sonce oyu can die from lack of food and water and stealth actuallly works on the AI/other players whcih is pretty neat i think. It kept me interested for a while so id say give it a shot. I mean its free so why not?
8916	1	a	I like this game, it's very easy to play.
8918	1	a	Its a fun game, but it can be very buggy!
8920	1	a	Fun game if you like sandboxes, shooters and MMOs!
6357	0	a	this game is terrible, self immolation is better than this.
8922	1	a	I got this because I couldn't afford any 'Fallout'. It was a pretty big mistake. However, it was fun while it lasted and until I bought 'Fallout: New Vegas'. In the long run, just save your money and buy Fallout. It's a bit more rewarding.
6360	0	a	While Fallen Earth is interesting, the whole thing feels incomplete.
8924	1	a	Most people overlook Fallen Earth because its a F2P game, but you'd be suprised what it has to offer. Multiple maps that are extensive in size, the ability to craft over 90% of the items used in-game and the massive amounts of players that join everyday. This is a game I would recomend to any fan of MMORPGs, Post-Apocalyptic games or those who enjoy team combat.
8926	1	a	Great game to play. I have to be honest, the begining is very boring because its hard to overcome easy obstacles. But once you get going, it gets amazing and really fun. I recommend this to patient players.
6361	0	a	I want that hour of my life back, this game is ♥♥♥♥. Comparing this game to Fallout should be punishable by law!
8928	1	a	good game once you get out the volt it is very hmmm free out there . do what you wont when you wont make what you wont. kill what you wont its good game the map is big as i am lost right know lol.... but game play was fun... what i have a problem with..... 1 server was down the next day no clue way . 2 when doing some missions and you die ...you get spond somewhere in a nother volt no ideal how to gt bad mission done..... way i am lost...... 3 the horse you have eats much   i well give this game a 9 out of 10 it be 10 if the servers would give us info on server updates and shutdowns
8930	1	a	Fun. Worth a try!
8932	1	a	My most Favorite game of all time .. This game has everything a wast lander could ask for, Open world(Sandbox) lots of equipment and weapons .. I truly love this game.
8934	1	a	Very fast pace :3 
6366	0	a	oh my days. what a pile of steamy crap.  this has all the makings to be a good(ish, well, maybe) game. but as it is, it is as it stated above. the first thing you will notice is how hidious the control scheme/layout is. it just feels so wrong, sort of shagging your mothers best freind wrong, and then you acidently send your mum one of the pics with you wearing her best freind like a puppet.  that is how wrong the control layout feels. due to the major flaw and the other major factor that wvwry one who plays this game is a sad lonely pervert, who persistanly talks slander and poo, unless they think your a girl,then you can tell there typing one handed, while the other is already at the lotion.  so make what you will of my review, my reviews are honest, unlike most, with the crack licking, ring shining , im after free crap speaches. #keep your free crap for a good review, my toungue is for my lady's batty, not dev's. kids, remember that one
8936	1	a	I totally recommend this game. i know like most free to play MMO's there is a cap on what you can do with the free account but its not low enough to really bother you. I personally like the crafting in the game. i like the fact that you can find nearly everything you need in the open world or collecting it from things/people you killed. Most of the players are really friendly and willing to help! I do think that the tutorial should maybe be a little longer as i dont think that it really explains enough to understand the game when you enter the world. I also love the fact that you get to craft vehicles for transport. The fact that the map is sooooooooooooooooo big i mean its huge. AWESOME game. One of my FAVS!!!!!! I really dont think i have come across anything that i dont like about it :) 10/10
8938	1	a	For a f2p mmo such as this, the gameplay is quite enjoyable. Though the story takes a small while to warm up, after players get to know the UI to a reasonable level the game becomes slightly addictive. Cooperative class building, equipment crafting and missions make for an enjoyable experience as you and your friends explore new environments.   The only issue I had is late game when pvp gets involved. The terrirotrial resource war pvp becomes very demanding on computer performance. Though not a game breaking issue, folks without gaming towers will just have to stick with pve (which isn't really a bad thing).
8940	1	a	'This is one of the most epic games ever!'
8942	1	a	Amazing game, If you liked Fallout and/or Stalker, then this is the game for you.
8944	1	a	it is a VERY addictive game if you get really into it you will most like spend a year on it like i did its pvp is ok but if you like pve its a fun game alot of bosses,armor,weapons all that sorta stuff as well as alot of crafting recipies if you like crafting then you will like fallen earth also beware of the clan condemned ^.^
8946	1	a	Yes it is a very fun game and adventureous.
6368	0	a	Great Game for a while biut then really really gets really really boring
8948	1	a	I is recomend, yes!
8950	1	a	Definitely the best game you don't have to buy.  Fallout Simulator to the max.  That being said......it is amazing, and it is addictive. Even more fun when you meet new friends to help you with quests!
8952	1	a	An interesting concept. The graphics could be better ,but overall it is a very nice game. Even with a tons of people playing on it it still plays very smooth even on my laptop which is amazing. I would recomend this game to anyone that wants to really get into one game at a time because it is a little time consuming. Again overall it is a good and fun game.
8954	1	a	Its like a fallout clone. no  IGN-Shrek out of 10
8956	1	a	Fallout meets MMO... with vehicles... Love it.
6373	0	a	This game is almost always down, what a shame, because it is quite good though.
8958	1	a	If you're looking for something different. This right here, my friend, this right here?! Is where it's at.   The game begins off very slow, and the tutorial is lacking, but with a bit of determination, and a little of asking some questions, you'll be on the right track on finding grace in this game. Lots of quests, first-third person shooter, free roam, MMORPG, Fallout-ish, with motorcycles and dune buggies. The further you get, the more rewarding it gets.   The game is free, worth a try, and alot of the community is pretty nice overall.   If you need some pointers, and by the time you read this review and I'm still playing, hit me up, and I'll give you some pointers. I'll lead you in the right direction.
8960	1	a	I've got to say this is the most fun game of all steam free-play games. It kinda mixes in with a little bit of RUST and some Fallout 3. But I do like RPG and Adventure games most fun I had in years with any other game. I have ever played Most likely I just love the graphics on this game really really spot on. Hopefully i can get some of my friends to play this with me and team up with a bunch of players. SEE YOU GUYS IN THE WASTELAND
8962	1	a	its the type of game you need time to play with.... and yes there is PVP
6375	0	a	Empty, lifeless and dull environment, awkward combat, mounts and a lack of direction. Quit feeling more bored than when I started playing it. Dreary!
6376	0	a	This stupid game seems to be ALWAYS offline. There isn't a moment it is not. It may be a glitch for me, or something, but still.. FIX. THE. GAME.
8964	1	a	OMG!!!! This game is a game!
8966	1	a	If you have nothing to do, got a couple hours spare a day, or wanna try something new? Try this, it truely is an amazing experience, altho the game takes time to get used too, and actually be worthwhile, when you get to a good stage, the game is purely amazing, altho, i have only played 4 hours myself, i plan on playing alot more. I got this game yesterday, and have played it in all my spare time. And, for a FREE game, its perfect.
8968	1	a	one of the best free to play i have :) i love this game
8970	1	a	Beautiful game, loads of fun to play. It's huge, it's detailed, and as long as you're happy to play a game that you can't master in five seconds, you'll not regret the huge download! (Plus it has an amazing community, which is the most important part.)
8972	1	a	is like fallout 3 but it FREE
8974	1	a	It takes a while to get used to but stick to it and it's really great fun. The crafting is amazing and the combat is very different than the usual MMO style. This game deserves a try. Give it a few hours and keep an open mind and you'll definitely see what I mean.  The controls are a bit odd at the beginning but you get used to it after a while. The atmosphere of this game is great. I've never felt more involved in a game world then in this one, it's an amazing experience. I just wish more people knew about this game, the craftable vehicles alone are a great experience.
8976	1	a	Hard To Get Started But Give It Time And Its Very Enjoyable
8978	1	a	I guess if I had to make it short and sweet it's like Fallout but with a much larger focus on crafting and multiplayer, so I suppose if you enjoy fallout you'll enjoy this
8980	1	a	This game is awesome you get skills like in maplestory and you get to make your own guns and armor and vechiles 
8982	1	a	Yes it is a very fun game and adventureous.
6382	0	a	Just a big MMO and not even a good one. Too much grinding.
8984	1	a	This game is pretty good but it is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. It is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t because you can download the game for mac on websites but not on steam.
8986	1	a	This is a game you can put hours and hours into and still have something to do. It has a very helpful community and moderators are almost always online. There is a very wide variety of weapons and clothing and you can also get many vehicles. It has an online store if you go on gamersfirst but it doesn't really give any advantage in terms of strength or firepower, the best you can get is premium and new mounts. Some glitches here and there including teleporting AI and wallhacking AI but thats most games. I haven't ever seen a hacker my entire 230 hours of gameplay so thats always a plus. To sum it up, it has a good engine to play on, VERY HUGE map and so many different missions and items it will keep you busy for awhile.
8988	1	a	So you like mad max huh? so you think u can handle the end of times?  Like mounts (cars or horses?)  Enjoy!  It's great.
6383	0	a	This game is complete garbage
8990	1	a	This game is all ive wanted in a open world game. its huge and stratigic and ive never had a game experiance like this. id get this game instead of fallout hands down. it blows all other games of its kind out of the water
8992	1	a	highly recommend if you like the fallout series mainly new vegas and fallout 3 this game is a little bit different though because theres a big emphasis on crafting and there are mounts and its multiplayer but kindof the same setting as fallout with the whole desert waistland and mutated creatures and factions
8994	1	a	Looking for a free2play Survival Wasteland styled MMORPG? Love the Fallout franchise? Then this is for you.
8996	1	a	I love this game alot but can you make a alternative server for when the main server is down.That would be awesome!!!!:)
8998	1	a	I wouldnt even freakin log in, with steam, or without it. still looks fun :( i envy those who can play it
9000	1	a	this game is absolutely fun if you have been looking for a free 2 play fallout game has its rpg elements and is multiplayer so u can have fun with your friends!!!! :)
6385	0	a	I pretty much hated this game. It may look cool on the pictures, but if you take my advise, it sucks.
9002	1	a	A slow paced TPS/FPs MMORPG with moderate character customization and heavy, deep, and intricate character development. A good game to while away the day, not graphic intensive, nor very demanding on your system, this game is definitely not a blockbuster hit, but it does tickle that special need to getting my grind on. Grinding for materials (crafting) or grinding for exp (I swear I only have one more bubble to level!) and grinding for gear (QUESTS!!!!), this game is basically a big grind fest.
9004	1	a	Good game features, great mmo, monsterious customization and crafting system.  Lacks a more fluid combat system.
9006	1	a	so cool!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!but i cant play it cuz it wont let me creat an account
9008	1	a	Pretty fun, could use some better human models though. I love the concept, and frankly I love how expansive the map is; though, again, could use maybe some more as far as customization.
9010	1	a	Free, enjoyable, and tons to do and explore. Who knew the end of the world could be this much fun?
9012	1	a	Perfect game for absolutely free. It is a game right at you finger tips if you like genre.
9014	1	a	Fallen Earth is a futuristic romp through a war-torn post-apocalyptic wasteland packed full of fantastic features such as skippable cinematics, people that shoot at you, mutated chickens that do not look like mutated chickens at all, and lead pipes that you can hit these mutated chickens with for not looking like mutated chickens.   One of the most disorientating features I noticed was the nostalgic UI ripped from the mid-90s. Well great now all I want to do is play Furcadia again. I should have just went and installed Furcadia and I could have played as a dogtaur and barked at cat people or something cool. My friend and I spent a good while learning how to better cooperate as we tried to work together against the game’s nonexistent group quest tracking features, but not too long after came the highlight of our night when we both logged out of the game and went to sleep.    So is this the Fallout 3 Online we’ve all been waiting for? Yes. Your search is over. Fallen Earth is basically the popular post-apocalyptic roleplaying game Fallout 3 by Bethesda, if Fallout 3 were a massive online piece of ♥♥♥♥. That is Fallen Earth. So if you like to play games online and have them toss pieces of ♥♥♥♥ at you in your livingroom you should install this game. It’s pretty much free. Free pieces of ♥♥♥♥ thrown at you for free. Enjoy.
6388	0	a	its ♥♥♥♥
9016	1	a	great game would defenitly recommend this to friends
6389	0	a	Great Game for a while biut then really really gets really really boring
9018	1	a	Good game, kinda like fallout, i can see myself getting into it.
9020	1	a	Badassery at its highest. With the right perking, you can be a terror of PvP
6393	0	a	When I did downlaod the game, it would let me play even though I had made an account for this game. If there was something that I didn't do, please tell me. 
9022	1	a	highly recommend if you like the fallout series mainly new vegas and fallout 3 this game is a little bit different though because theres a big emphasis on crafting and there are mounts and its multiplayer but kindof the same setting as fallout with the whole desert waistland and mutated creatures and factions
9024	1	a	It looks really good
9026	1	a	very fun it fallout and wow combined
9028	1	a	Good Game if you like Fallout style games. Although its very complicated and its recommended you play with someone/ or your friends....
9030	1	a	Why write a review / describe my first impression when I can do a video?   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1slzP92IGD4  note: this was one of my earlier reviews / first impressions.

9032	1	a	♥♥♥♥-tastic. 
9034	1	a	Very similar to Planet Calypso without the real money economy, space travel and a more Fallout 3 setting. However for a Free to Play game it's great and if I didn't already play Planet Calypso I would be playing this!
9036	1	a	Just like any other MMORPG, but this is a FPS/RPG hybridization with first-person/third person views within a post-apocalyptic wasteland located around the Grand Canyon circa 2050. The world map covers more than 1000 square kilometres of usable terrain. At first the game is very slow and boring, but once you get in the higher levels it becomes better. Run around collect scrap, create weapons, equipment, vehicles and ect. Fallen Earth has a lot of potential, but too many repetitive tasks just like any other MMORPG. Free2Play = Pay2Win.
9038	1	a	♥♥♥♥-tastic. 
9040	1	a	Registration sucks! but the game is good!
9042	1	a	Pretty good, but a lot of time into it and learned most of the ins and outs. I enjoy games set in post-apocalyptic settings, so I took it for a spin. It features a solid combat system, responsive controls and aiming, and plenty of things to do. The only bone I would pick with Fallen Earth is that it does require a lot of grinding to make solid progress into higher level zones, which is why I haven't played it in a while.
6397	0	a	This is terrible. I wish I'd not downloaded it. I wish I'd not given them my email. I also spent a good 15 minutes wishing I wasn't playing the tutorial.
9044	1	a	fun,action,rpg good to play with friends
9046	1	a	great game would defenitly recommend this to friends
6399	0	a	Great Game for a while biut then really really gets really really boring
9048	1	a	I got this because I couldn't afford any 'Fallout'. It was a pretty big mistake. However, it was fun while it lasted and until I bought 'Fallout: New Vegas'. In the long run, just save your money and buy Fallout. It's a bit more rewarding.
6400	0	a	Since I have not played any of the Fallout games, I will not be making any comparisons to Fallen Earth. After playing this for a while, I thought this is a neat concept, but sadly fely this was a wasted opportunity to make a good mmo. First off, it runs like crap on low end computers and overall it felt really boing after a while. I'm pretty sure there are settings to boost performance, but either way, there really isn't all that much to do besides exploring the environment, which happens to be mostly flat desert until you are able to travel far away from the starting area and crafting weapons. Combat is dull as a sack of bricks so you can forget trying pvp since there is no cover and all I have seen is people dancing around in circles since the range on some of the guns are really short. That pretty much sums up on what I have to say about this game so if you like walikng around looking at terrain with occasional crafting then fine, but otherwise your time is better spent on something else.
9050	1	a	Try it
9052	1	a	Its a great game, if you like a really well desgined storyline and post apociliptic fallout, its the game for you. 10/10
9054	1	a	Was a good game and fun but is like a poor mans Fallout.... I mean seriously, its nearly ripped out a piece of The fallout series.  Combat is 1-sided though due to weapon damage and higher level, and controlls are qeurky, but overall is a good game and atleast deserves 7/10
9056	1	a	Very Good Game... That's All I Can Say About This Game As I Haven't Played Much Of It :P Also I Think This Game Is Single Player Only :P From The Start Of Playing This I Would Say...8/10
9058	1	a	Excellent MMO if crafting is your bag.
9060	1	a	i frekin love every damn thing about this gane.... maybe too much...
6406	0	a	why i cant do account that is problem
9062	1	a	Guys this game does not let me log in even though i registered for gamers first account it just keeps saying login error, would there be something wrong with the game or what?
6407	0	a	This game is a bad game, a very bad game. Stahp.
9064	1	a	Yes i reccomend if you like fallout and want it multiplayer this is it its SO COOOL create your character begining sequence awesome just PLAY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
9066	1	a	Great game lots of fun, Although somepeople pay2win, It's a lot funner too play through without paying a thing. Great crafting system, Great combat. Overall 10/10. :)
6409	0	a	First time playing, looked interesting, nice concept for a setting. The reason why I wasn't able to sink my teeth into the gameplay is because the UI was so unimaginably despicable that it was too difficult to navigate. It was so complicated and clunky and in the way, that it was too hard to even complete the tutorial without losing my horse, becoming stranded, and being unable to progress. Terrible quest guidelines, terrible UI, terrible map overlay, terrible interface in general, terrible design. Vote thumbs down for this one. Big time- don't waste your time installing.
9068	1	a	For a game that copied fallout-3, it looks like it has the possibility of being cool until you try and navigate the extensive UI which explodes in your face too many opinions to count. Why is the UI full of worthless clutter? Maybe a large use of inadequate programming which requires multiple buttons to get to the same option. I see why there is someone who spent over 10,800 (1.25 years in time straight) hours in this game; most likely trying to navigate the extensive UI.
9070	1	a	Clone Simulator 2013: Wasteland edition. In the game, you play as a clone of someone (Which looks like the character you created.) On a expiration date. because you use teleporters to reach the main base of the resistence and messed with you atomical struckure or something, you are no longer able to, let's just say 'Run into a field of enemies, die 'n' respawn.' This game is essintially 'Fallout 3: The clone uprising; MMO edition'   I think there's a crafting system? i haven't played since like 2013.  No but really, play it if you haven't. it has all your 'I'm-dying-because-I'm-a-clone-of-some♥♥♥♥♥♥♥-tha's-probley-dead-by-now-so-i-can-join-him-or-her' Needs.
9072	1	a	If you are a fallout 3 or fallout new vegas fan then this is your game. If you played the ps3 version or any of the early releases of it you know what to expect.   It's a great game with great idea's a cool leveling system and a wide open world.  The community is generally pretty helpful and the beggining few levels give a lot to the new players to get going,  It's got a decent learing curve for leveling since it's not your typical level system, but overall i think it's good.  Aside from all that, it's glitchy as heck. first person view is good but glitchy and i mean glitchy! Combat lags, and glitches, and the overall world is glitchy meaning you will get stuck at somepoint. But the developers must have known this and gave you a skill to kill yourself to respawn at a nearby lifepod.  overall i would say this game is worth a go, and if you sub it's definitly better. but you can do alright without paying.  I would say overall i it get's a 6/10. needs work but worth a try.
9074	1	a	Nice game if your lookn for something to cure that itch you have for a Fallout MMO..Plus there are no classes which is awesome, you can level up anything and everthing.
9076	1	a	Not the best mmo on the net, but a great opportunity for apocaliptic-lovers.
9078	1	a	This game was ok, its a pretty decent MMO, the only downside, is the Enemies, they respawn rather quickly, and if your on a quest to get an object thats surrounded by idk 20 enemy NPC's if your not mega-high level to take them down quick (or if you dont have someone with you like that) youll get through half before they start showing up again, and then youll have to deal with all the new NPC's as well.
6413	0	a	I'll keep this short. I've been playing Fallen Earth for a few years, mostly using the standalone game, but recently through Steam. I have maybe 500 hours total on Fallen Earth. The game has only gotten worse over time and I can't recommend it to new players.  The same bugs that have always existed still exist, the animations and visuals aren't very good, it's very poorly optimized and takes pretty decent hardware to make it run acceptably, and instead of creating further incentive to buy content and become a subscriber, they just make it more difficult to play for free. A prime example of this is the semi-recent gimp to the crafting system. The developers up and limited the crafting qeue to one item for free players. One. Keep in mind this is a game heavily focused on crafting. It now takes exponentially longer to craft large things like vehicles and weapons that take multiple parts, because you constantly have to go back and add new items to the qeue. This was supposed to be incentive to pay for the game, but at least for me it just made me stop playing. I came back and started playing again recently and it's just as bad as ever.  The game simply isn't fun. It's a half-finished mess that more hassle than it's worth if you're playing for free. In my opinion, Fallen Earth is a prime example of F2P games done wrong. The developers don't care about the players, or improving the game. There are a ton of things they could have done over the years to improve the game and make it more attractive to paying players, but instead they've decided to just leave the game glitchy and half-♥♥♥♥♥ and instead draw in paying players by making it too ♥♥♥♥♥♥ to play for free.  Avoid this game. You might find it fun for a few hours; you might find the combat enjoyable, because honestly it is, but once you play a little longer you'll get bored and regret the hours you've wasted. I know I do.
9080	1	a	great game for survival 9/10
9082	1	a	Dasterd, Tell me your steam name oh and also, this game is really neato
6415	0	a	Fallen Earth - is that even for a wild f**king? Fallout Online? Well, Islamic nun is more similar to Fallout Online! 0/10 - it's just some kind of horror, with terrible graphics, awkward controls, and even curve as ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s aged legs! It's not a game. It's a very very good ♥♥♥♥.
9084	1	a	The closest thing to a Fallout MMO currently available, this game has some really neat ideas.
9086	1	a	Fallout much? 
9088	1	a	its a great Free2Play World Wide Surviving, Pve, Pvp game, tons of places to discover and crafts.
6417	0	a	This game is bad, really bad. In-game advertisements, horrible UI, poor AI, substandard graphics and animation. This would have been a decent MMO 10 years ago, but is subpar in the current state of the genre. Steer clear.
9090	1	a	Don't go by how long steam says I've played. I've played this game for 480hrs lol (played with xCHANG). I played it for about 20days worth. This game is amazing. This is the only game I have ever gotten addicted to. I haven't been able to find a game that can replace it. The only downfall is that there aren't that much people on, but its not as small as the steam community hub says (300-500 people on) most people play using the Fallen Earth launcher thats on the gamersfirst website  http://www.gamersfirst.com/  even the GMs recommend using it because it helps some people with the lag because some people have steam doing auto updates in the background while playing. Also you don't see that much people when your traveling because they're normally in the big cities like Los Alamos or in sector 5 or at the raids in Progress town, Stronghold, and Citadel (which is in Deadfall where most people go to power level) for example. They are also doing Gore bosses.   Anyways it's a great game go check it out.
6418	0	a	This game is fun, the respond times for enemys are not. ONE STARTS AN UNDERGROUND MISSION AND ENEMYS ONE HAS KILLED RESPNONDS BEFORE ONES MISSION IS DONE WHY? Is it a poor programing mistake or are the developers expecting to have people fight into and out of a dungon. 3-5 MINUTE RESPOND TIMERS ARE TOO SHORT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
9092	1	a	This game is really nice, they do a great job with showing you how to progress and move forward, and that is a great thing about an mmo. Plus the whole game looks good, you can't go bad with this game.
9094	1	a	Very fun with friends otherwise don't spend the time. 
9096	1	a	I would ♥♥♥♥ this game in the ♥♥♥ untill I break its ♥♥♥.
9098	1	a	Tried most the FTP MMO's and this one is about the most balanced and fair offering out there. Not pay to win. Any money you do decide to spend, generously rewarded with extra goodies.
9100	1	a	I really like this game xD
9102	1	a	Great game love the way the item system works as well
9104	1	a	Very fun! and indepth, create your class style with the good old fasioned gear/weapon system
6421	0	a	the game was grea, but it has died out. alot. fighting in 'dungeons' with no one there to really helps makes the game very dificult in alot of missions and with how good weapons are so hard to come by now due to the world trade system being almost empty now.
6422	0	a	I've tried this game twice now. its awefull, with clunkey mmo game play
6423	0	a	I made a character and then the game froze, 10/10
6424	0	a	Controls are awkward, questing is awkward, the characters movements are awkward. Overall, its like the feeling you get when you walk into a room and ask 'You all look like someone died!' when infact, someone has. Awkward. Avoid this game.
9106	1	a	This game gave me testicular cancer.
6425	0	a	THIS GAME IS 10% KIDS 20% FUN 15% CONCENTRATED POWER TO RUN 5% FINISHED 50% LAME AND A 100 PERCENT REASON TO IGNORE THIS GAME
9108	1	a	BEST GAME 
9110	1	a	Saw this downloadable on Steam, was thinking about giving it a second chance...Played for several years, took a break. This game, like many others, comes close, but falls short of the Ultimate MMORPG(FPS).  Pros:  Detailed crafting system. Excellent Foraging/Salvaging System. Gain levels from crafting. Crafting actually takes longer (for a realistic effect), ie. you can't craft a car in 2 minutes, it takes awhile... Gameplay is fun, it's nice to have a MMOFPS that actually counts headshots. Graphics are decent. You actually have to aim (for most skills/attacks). Pretty Realistic in some aspects.   Cons: The character animations are super clunky and akward. Small playerbase. The mutations (think of it as magic in other games) are pretty limited, ie. no 'caster' class in the game.   That's about all I can think of for now. Overall, it's a good game, if you haven't tried it, its atleast worth a try!
9112	1	a	Not exactly a unique game. An alternative to the Fallout series.  It's pretty fun starting out.  As your level gets higher, you find yourself alone most of the time. The maps are so incredibly large; it can be a pain in the ♥♥♥ sometimes.
9114	1	a	Even though i havent had the game for long i still think its great. Good old fasion PvE with some PvP zones, love it. Good crafting mechanics, quests, lvls, and fighting AI. In my opinion i would give this game an 8/10.
9116	1	a	Its a great game, if you like a really well desgined storyline and post apociliptic fallout, its the game for you. 10/10
9118	1	a	Addictive PvE, addictive crafting, and an interesting backdrop. Just wouldn't suggest the PvP aspects unless you have a high-end rig that can pull in 60-150 FPS consistently.
9120	1	a	Hello there. My name is Horatio McDangle and I will be your reccomender. This game is fun. Thank you for reading, have a nice ♥♥♥♥ buddy.
6430	0	a	This game game takes far too long to load i had to give up after 3 hours just waiting for it to connect to server and all that other ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, dont think i would recommend this gme to anyone unless that is resolved
9122	1	a	very good but i would like it to be a first person veiw game but all in all very
6431	0	a	The ♥♥♥♥ing thing makes you go nowhere and when you finely make a acount it says that the acount isn't there.
9124	1	a	I played this game in Beta, and it has come so far since then. Great graphics, target orriented combat, thousands of missions, best crafting system Ive seen in a game (you can be all proffesions) and random bonuses. Everyone is on one server. I subscribed, but there is no need to, f2p offers a ton in itself.
6433	0	a	Friendly community, fun content, good items/weapons, and massive world to explore.  If your looking for a fallout mmo this isn't it but it's still a pretty good game. I spend a lot of time in the AH.  Edit: After 400 hours, and $200+ spent on this game I will say a few things, I haven't played for about a month but when I did, the server lag was so bad it was almost unplayable. One day the server had to have 3 restarts. If you make a clan/guild and take a break from the game, your ownership of the clan/guild will be taken away after a certain period of time of you not being on. If you don't like pvp then there's not much to do at end-game....The grinding is a big part of leveling in this game. If you do like pvp, well there's some good news and bad news the good news is: If you are at level 55 (the cap) and you want to fight lower levels you can, and you'll get a debuff so that it's more fair to the lower levels, the bad news it that the debuff is so extreme that a level 55 can be killed by a really low level in pvp areas. Don't be fooled by the tutorial, there is no voice acting while talking to people such as when they tell you what a quest is (NPCS and after tutorial) The 'built in voice chat' doesn't work either when there is a feature in the settings for it..another downside....  I'm changing my vote to not recommended, it pains me to do it because I did enjoy my experience but it could go both ways for me...
9126	1	a	In a not so idealistic post apocalyptic world, you awaken in a facility in which you discover that you are a clone. And as a clone, your lives are infinite, you die, you come back in the Lifenet facility... Only, Alec Masters, the Governor for Life, has fixed it so you never come back. Choices, choices, choices... Do you specialize in spray and pray or shotgun weddings? Do you harness devistating or life saving mental powers? Do you become one of the most feared assassins or snipers? Are you so good with numbers the market has no chance against your silvered tongue and you become rich? Do your friends call you Gadget, refer to you as a Tech head because you're so good with mechanics? The possibilities are enormous. Survival. Death. Destruction. Creation. Exploration.   Who will you be?  --Review-- The communities here are amazingly helpful, the staff are wonderful and down to earth. The world is a beautiful mesh of old world technology and new world surviving. There is no 'Pay to Win' system as all weapons and armors are crafted in game. Subscriptions give bonuses to experience and crafting times and quantities. Everything purchassable in the game store can be found in the auction house. There is a realistic role play set and background storyline. The main questline is in depth, side quests are available everywhere, clans and factions each have their benefits.  If you are looking for something not so.. cookie cutter... in a game, try Fallen Earth.
6434	0	a	alright, lets get started let me first tell you its not a complete ♥♥♥♥ UP but it has its moments. It needs lots of work. It needs better grapchics, beter movment, and for christ sakes a crouch and sprint button. shooting is a nightmare and movment seems awful. DONT GET THIS GAME IT IS A WASTE OF TIME. FALLOUT 3 IS SO MUCH BETTER even if your not looking for multiplayer game.
6435	0	a	i believe if you are on a fallen earth and you are falling then you need a parachute
9128	1	a	Lots of bugs but over all still good.
6436	0	a	Not Very Good at all in my Opinion...
6437	0	a	1/10 Couldn't make it through the tutorial because the servers refused to respond for more than 5 minutes. Tried it multiple times with a perfect connection from my end, minimal graphics, and nothing else running. Supposed to be a great game, but unless they fix their servers not worth even trying.
9130	1	a	this game is really underrated  dont listen to hate comments and noobs who dont know how to play  like the game is really good (in my opinion)  give it a try
6438	0	a	This game is messy and is free for a reason. Just simple dont play it, there is more out there that is WAY better.
9132	1	a	Big and Strong online game
9134	1	a	This game is awesome! Ride your hourse or your bike from town to town, looting for food and item and then buy some food or fuel to continue your journey, this game is so reality and I love it! people in here are nice, but there is some guys look like a scammer, always ask for your Steam Profile Number, don't share your info to ANYONE !!  Just try it ! And don't compare this game with fallout, they are different! just try it and you will see ! 10/10  
6439	0	a	There's a bug that I don't know how to fix: Every time I start the game, all I see is gray, a few textures here and there but pretty much nothing. the textures show up for about a second right when I start the game. Can anybody help?
9136	1	a	Great community, out of the ordinary universe, great game overall,despite the ocasional bugs
6440	0	a	not that good. Click a weapon to equip :/  you cant eat food  Other than that its good
6441	0	a	If I can sum this game into one word, FREEMIUM. It is free to play, only if you dedicate days of your life. In order to upgrade you will have to grind your levels in crafting in order to build a better lead pipe to get a +1 attack rate. The crafting system is time based and you can only craft one thing at a time. it calls itseIf a survival game but the only thing you survive is the godawful boredom you experience. If you set aside everything wrong with the game and still wanna play it, get your wallet ready.
9138	1	a	It's good!
6443	0	a	this used to be such a good game till Reloaded productions ruined it
6444	0	a	Corrupt game full of corrupt admin's that let players kiss up to them to get 'get out of jail free cards'. They ban people for anything these days, so save yourself some time and don't play this game. Uninstall works well though
9140	1	a	2156 = Future Sucks = Play it
9142	1	a	ITs like Age of conan with Guns, survival and crafting. the action isnt bad at all you really can't complain. Crafting, riding horses, driving cars. Decent PVP, open classes. (takes effort though). Decent sized world. Lots of crafting. Emotes are fun too. I played this back in Beta.  Crafting 10/10 you can make almost everything. tons of recipes Gameplay 8/10 lots of exploring. it is possible to get every skill in the game. though one hell of an undertaking. Combat 7/10 (vindictus is 10/10 imo) this game is on par with any other MMORPG. and better in alot of ways. you can headshot with melee. Story 8/10 There are alot of quests. doing the starters for each faction gets you alot of free stuff and points. PVP 7/10 pretty standard stuff. occaisional lagg. but generally satisfying.
9144	1	a	Great Game, If u like sandbox games, Dayz, WoW or Rust.Then this is the game for you!
6446	0	a	i can't even login. so far it sucks for me!
9146	1	a	it's alright as a whole. it's basically fallout mmo. without the deathclaws.  it's a bit slow at the beginning, but once you get the hang of things, it gets better. gun play is a bit bland, but hey... i still think it's good.
9148	1	a	For the short time I've been in game it didn't seem too bad, the other 7 hours were spent trying to load in or update.   
9150	1	a	really great crafting system but lack luster combat and repetitive skills, many things like getting your horse, or specializing attributes can be confusing, only play if you have read a few guides and watched gameplay on youtube, low graphics quality, but that's not that big of a deal, crafting is fairly easy to get into and you will likely spend a majority of your time grinding, planning and making items, or hoarding things, and selling them in the decent auction house, this is a mmo not unlike falout mixed with WoW  oh and the fast travel is bad, 5 min. or so on horse occaisonally falling or getting attacked to get to another town, even worse on foot
9152	1	a	A free-2-play MMO that takes place in the Post-apocalyptic grand Canyon.  All i can say is if you are waiting for WarZ to become a better game but you want to scratch that apocalyptic itch now then this is a game worth at least trying. it Free no no harm in trying.
9154	1	a	6/10 could be better
9156	1	a	Lots of bugs but over all still good.
6449	0	a	Not Very Good at all in my Opinion...
9158	1	a	this game is really underrated  dont listen to hate comments and noobs who dont know how to play  like the game is really good (in my opinion)  give it a try
9160	1	a	In a not so idealistic post apocalyptic world, you awaken in a facility in which you discover that you are a clone. And as a clone, your lives are infinite, you die, you come back in the Lifenet facility... Only, Alec Masters, the Governor for Life, has fixed it so you never come back. Choices, choices, choices... Do you specialize in spray and pray or shotgun weddings? Do you harness devistating or life saving mental powers? Do you become one of the most feared assassins or snipers? Are you so good with numbers the market has no chance against your silvered tongue and you become rich? Do your friends call you Gadget, refer to you as a Tech head because you're so good with mechanics? The possibilities are enormous. Survival. Death. Destruction. Creation. Exploration.   Who will you be?  --Review-- The communities here are amazingly helpful, the staff are wonderful and down to earth. The world is a beautiful mesh of old world technology and new world surviving. There is no 'Pay to Win' system as all weapons and armors are crafted in game. Subscriptions give bonuses to experience and crafting times and quantities. Everything purchassable in the game store can be found in the auction house. There is a realistic role play set and background storyline. The main questline is in depth, side quests are available everywhere, clans and factions each have their benefits.  If you are looking for something not so.. cookie cutter... in a game, try Fallen Earth.
6450	0	a	alright, lets get started let me first tell you its not a complete ♥♥♥♥ UP but it has its moments. It needs lots of work. It needs better grapchics, beter movment, and for christ sakes a crouch and sprint button. shooting is a nightmare and movment seems awful. DONT GET THIS GAME IT IS A WASTE OF TIME. FALLOUT 3 IS SO MUCH BETTER even if your not looking for multiplayer game.
6451	0	a	its, boring really ( dont buy this ) 
9162	1	a	I loved this game, the meaning behind it was amazing :D
6452	0	a	JUST NO! There are no words to explain how irritatingly bad this is... I have no bad thoughts against the people who made this game but... IT NEEDS TO BE FIXED!
6453	0	a	Honestly it's a good concept. But with DOS attacks, high lvl asshats, and money barriers it makes the game not worth playing.
9164	1	a	The poor man's Fallout: New Vegas.   7.2/10
9166	1	a	I PBTM this game for a few months as it was ok then I went off it. Then I went back for a bit of fun before taking another break. Then after it went F2P, it got good... The F2P option really boosted this game making the PVP awesome. Graphics are not really edgey, but the grittyness of the textures and the mild resolution problems, all seem to bring into contrast this stark and rough world of the future. No classes means this game is a real equaliser in PVP combat - You choose your weapons, armor, buffs and combat style - if you die - it's your fault. Crafting is a major pain in the game until you realise that it is what will put you apart from the pack - solo or teamed this game rocks. 9/10 Dragons
9168	1	a	this game is great i would recommend this game for anyone :D
9170	1	a	Very Good this game is like fallout and it is very interesting
6459	0	a	This game has a long way to go before it can be consider ready. Over half of the audio doesn't work(no gunshots, not footsteps, etc). The gameplay is substandard, and the control scheme needs a lot of work. The graphics are also substandard, looking closer to games from almost a decade ago than to current generation games.
9172	1	a	BEST GAME 
6461	0	a	I played back in the day when it first launched and again recently (8/9/15) as a F2P game on steam. The story is interesting, but that's all I can give it credit for.  'Clunky' and 'archaic' are the two best words to describe the rest of the gameplay as a whole. Controls, animations, combat, UI, etc. It all just feels low budget, probably because it is.  If you don't mind games that have an older, unpolished feeling to them, FE might do it for you.
6462	0	a	Its a good thing I didnt have to pay cuz the updates and character creation took 2 hours. I wouldnt have been able to get a refund. Fallen Earth is a big steamy pile of zombie dung. The sad thing is, i never even got to play the game. It just crashes. What a bummer cuz I really wanted to check it out.
6463	0	a	the game was grea, but it has died out. alot. fighting in 'dungeons' with no one there to really helps makes the game very dificult in alot of missions and with how good weapons are so hard to come by now due to the world trade system being almost empty now.
6464	0	a	I've tried this game twice now. its awefull, with clunkey mmo game play
6465	0	a	THIS GAME IS 10% KIDS 20% FUN 15% CONCENTRATED POWER TO RUN 5% FINISHED 50% LAME AND A 100 PERCENT REASON TO IGNORE THIS GAME
9174	1	a	Don't even remember playing this game, but apparently I tried it long enough to be able to write a review. 8.5/9.3 IGN
9176	1	a	tis cool mang
6467	0	a	Have tried to start the game several times. In the beginning, it would not even let me log in with my Steam ID. Later on, and also now, it starts updating something and quickly gets into an infinite loop trying to update and check data. Still have yet to experience any of this game... (Uninstall works, at least I hope so...)
6468	0	a	Had no clear story or direction.
9178	1	a	great game 8/10
6472	0	a	This game give me ♥♥♥♥♥♥l cancer from the start to the finish plz fix game so many bugs   10/10 IGN
6473	0	a	This game had some high potentail, and it started out good too. Once I progressesed through the game, I realized, the mechanics sucked, and overall it just gets worse and worse the longer you play.
9180	1	a	looks good gonna download and give it a try
9182	1	a	My comment on this? Pretty good if you ask me. Fighting is a bit tiring and the plot seems to go very slowly. But overall gameplay is good. Wouldn't mind playing for another week.
9184	1	a	Was riding around in my new ATV when a giant worm killed me 11/10.
6477	0	a	Game gets very boring, very fast. And there are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s everywhere.
6478	0	a	Didn't enjoy the game that much. I think the dev's don't put enough attention on the newer players and focus on keeping their older player base.
6479	0	a	DUDE THE UNINSTALL BUTTON WAS AWSOME I WAS LIKE, DUDE IMMA GO HUNT DOWN MR. UNINSTALL IN THE C DRIVE AND WHEN I SAW HIM I LONGSHOT HIM INTO THE RECYCLE BIN AND I FINISHED HIM OFF WITH A UNINSTALLTALITY!!!
9186	1	a	Wow this game is one of the best free to play games I have played. I played this game a lot it is nice if you have friends on this game because they can help out a lot. This game isn't preticularly easy but it is fun. Crafting takes a long time sometimes but this game has so much stuff. There are so many guns, vehicles and items. I would recommend you give it a try. I mean hey it is free. I rate this game a 7.5/10
6480	0	a	wtf is this
6481	0	a	look this game is kinda stupid with the looks of a game that game out in 2005 its not a fun game well not for me anyway if you like some RPG games give it a try but i think its a load of crad
6482	0	a	All the makings of a great game in a not great game!  Oh well, at least I didn't pay for it.
6483	0	a	0/10 would not recommend to use as lube
9188	1	a	Great game,there is always something to do,even if you get bored of doing events ,you can always craft something or keep killing creatures,&amp; harvest everything.
6487	0	a	I don't know why, but it doesn't let me play for some reason... When I launch the game, it keeps on lagging and I can abrely move until it crashes and needs to re-start the game...So yeah, it doesn't work for me.
9190	1	a	really fun :D
6488	0	a	Having trouble linking it to Steam and I've reset my Steam password three times (which, with Authenticator every single time is a huge pain in the ♥♥♥). I've wasted two hours and a support ticket (with no response from the manufacturer).  0/5 stars. Even looking on thier gamersfirst.[com] forums, it seems like this has been a recurring problem since 2011.  Frankly, I'm so angry at a wasted evening at this point that I could spit.  I'd appreciate any advice.
9192	1	a	interesting game played it way back during beta haven't played since
9194	1	a	Downloaded.... few minutes later. Yay! about to play the game , woops new updated, downloaded... downloaded... downloaded... meh uninstalled.  WASTE YOUR TIME SIMULATOR 2015 10/10
9196	1	a	FANTASTIC game!! GREAT graphics and gameplay!!! Whether you want to craft, farm and harvest, or blast your way through endless mutants, THIS GAME IS AWESOME!!! Vehicles, weapons and armor, camps and farms...you name it, you can craft it!! The storyline is good, and just the gameplay itself is worth it!!! I would recommend this game to anyone...you wont be disappointed!!!!
6492	0	a	It takes too long to start, too much stuff to download, confusing, like roblox with the mouse which you cant use for view. confusing again, dont understand at all
6493	0	a	this gem sucks
6494	0	a	It's simply a bad game...
6495	0	a	it is just awful no dout
9198	1	a	Not a bad game by any means. It's fun, enjoyable, does get repetitive at times..but you spend no money on it out of the box, and there is no box.  Thing is, you can only craft one item at a time, before having to buy at least one thing, to get more slots. Can suck, as that's 'one item', not 'one stack of items'..
9200	1	a	My favorite part is when the starting sequence is completely invisible to me.
9202	1	a	This game as a single-player experience is rather bland and pointless, however, the exploration factor is cool.   PRO TIP: Play this game with friends. Call them on the phone and play it together from the start. The character build is pretty cool, but beware the fact that you can't change your character, so try not to have the same characters as each other.   Clans are completely pointless. Unless you have a friend-base of 10 people to make a clan with, there's no point.   Missions aren't so bad, but cooperative exploration is amazing in my opinion.  Other than that, it's not a bad game. I wish there were more games like this though
6499	0	a	Ok sooooo, I installed went to play and it asks you to create an account. No problem lets do that. Wait, it is saying I already have  1......what?  I have never played this so how do I......ok let me attempt guessing it. Nope, not happening, so I try doing a password reset. IT WORKED, maybe now I can ♥♥♥♥ing play this game already. But wait.....what is my username associated to that password? I try everything I could think of, Steam name, E-mail and random usernames I usually use. Nope, nothing, nada, zip, zilch. I give up ♥♥♥♥ THIS GAME, UNINSTALLED. You know you have wasted your time installing when the game doesn't even want you to play it.
9204	1	a	Fallen Earth could be better but it's still not a bad MMO to play to get away from more mainstream MMO's.
6500	0	a	so i download this game and it says i need to set up an account so i type my email bla bla bla and then i validate it all and it says i need to install it and i click install and it gets flagged for containing a virus, i wouldnt waste any time trying to install it tbh
9206	1	a	♥♥♥♥ u game this game is SUPPER GAY so go and ♥♥♥♥ urself with this 
9208	1	a	A very good post apocolypse mmo. next to swtor the best free to play out there.
9210	1	a	Its an interesting MMO style game with lots of content and a huge map. However, it can be a very long and frustrating journey to get to the good things in the game. If you can look past that, I would say it is good, but do NOT expect Fallout or S.T.A.L.K.E.R.
6502	0	a	this is a verry confusing game if you can figure it out good for you but me... i just cant /☃\
9212	1	a	i have played this game for over 400+ hours in non steam it is a insanly fun game when you have people..... if you do then your set, no classes to pick its up to you to do so
9214	1	a	Nice little crafting based MMO. Kind of addicting.
9216	1	a	Love this game, it absorbed me, I got lost in it for over 800 hours. Unfortunately though, I couldn't adjust to the PvP.  There were the regular PvPers that I could generally take in a fight, but then there were elites.... and a large portion of the games best late game content is in PvP zones which was both my favorite part and my least favorite. But if you're up for a challenging PvP late game, and an immersive dark wasteland environment with good stories and a well thought out crafting and market system, then this is a good game for you. :)
6503	0	a	Takes a day to install then when you go to play it it needs to update 10000 updates that takes another day by then I'm over it and playing another game. I wouldn't waste my time downloading this it isn't even a good game after all that
6504	0	a	BAD game for real but it was made in 2011 so
9218	1	a	i recommend it. 1.) free. 2.) its fun and interesting. 3.) it gives you a fallout feel that will also get rid of all your fallout withdrawels. ok. so seriously. not pay to win/play/or even look. its free. feels wierd in a way but it also plays smoothly for jus about any pc. i personaly like this game. it reminds me of fallout 3 with a touch.
9220	1	a	Very good mmorpg for those who like post-apocalyptic gaming. Crafting system is excellent and lot of options how to gear up.
6505	0	a	Game doesn't bring a whole lot to the table. Generic fetch quest here. Generic go kill generic enemy quest there. Most of the enemies are the same just different skins and most don't even attack till you attack first. Over all this game just isn't something I can see myself playing in the future and I'm not going to suggest it to anyone. Uninstalling. 1/10
6506	0	a	wont even show the launcher, looks good but wont work...
9222	1	a	One of the better sandbox experiences on the market.   -Great crafting system -Decent skills system -Combat can be quite fun -Great atmosphere in game  Enemy AI and interface rather ruin the experience. But I'd still recommend checking it out as an example of how an open world can game be done.
9224	1	a	Fun when u know how to do it .. :))))
6508	0	a	So , first of all , this game is a pure sack of ♥♥♥♥. The develepors have tried to make this game happen , but that is never gonna happen... As I say in these cases : ~You cant make paint from ♥♥♥♥~.... This game is supposed to be good ? Nooooo....Only the screenshots they gave us on their steam store page here are good , the actual gameplay is dogshit !... This is a parody of skyrim...With guns :) Enough said. P.S , Mario has better graphics than game :) ( Not that I have anything against Mario , Mario is a great game :) )
9226	1	a	One of best game ever
9228	1	a	Best MMORPG I have ever played. It fills every need I could Possibly want in a Game. It's Got the gathering / resource finding for crafting. It's also got building and construction. You can make vehicles and faster mounts. Yea the games like 4 years old and the developers kinda abandoned the game. But hey it still has a alright active community. There are a abundance of quests. Always something to do or see. I give this a 10/10 Game! Love it so much, I bought commander for $30 bucks, and also Bought like $30 bucks worth of Shop items. First and only game I ever spent money on!
6510	0	a	great for about 12 hours of gameplay. after that even dropping money on it doesnt make it better.
6511	0	a	This game maybe fun if you actually get the game. but the game is super hard to understand.
9230	1	a	I tried to get into it, but always ended in 'meh'.  Not for me, but since I didn't give it a chance...  5.6 / 10
9232	1	a	it's boring in the beginning because you don't know ♥♥♥♥ but when you get your first atv it's ♥♥♥♥ing on! so yeah it's kinda boring graphics and so on but it's also kinda fun so decide for yourself i would recomend it but not to everyone.
9234	1	a	I like the post-apoctliptic style
6512	0	a	I initially didn't even know how to start the damn game. Launcher popped up, clicked next, a load bar showed for a few seconds then the launcher force quit. Repeated that a second time, then a third time to finally have it update to the newest version and start the game.  I took 5 steps into the control room and the game mini crashed, recovered, I killed the clone guy, then it just kept crashing and recovering repeatedly.  Can't even comment if the game itself is good or not since I didnt get to play it.
9236	1	a	You do have to put in a lot of time with this to get why it's good, but trust me, when you break through the barrier, there's a great Sandbox-ish MMO that is quite different and doesn't just copy-paste everything from WOW. It's creative and interesting, and crafts a unique and deep world which is fun to explore on horseback, or on foot. Speaking of crafting, the system in which you gather materials in order to make weapons and armour has been milked to death recently, yet it still has enough life left in it to be interesting in this game. It is a bit trial and error though. When a crossbow that I spent a fair few hours gatherin the materials for does pittance in comparison to the starting rifle, Gandhi gets salty.
6514	0	a	crap game how do u get a gun rating 1 star buy fallout not this descrace
9238	1	a	free version of fallout yeah i said it
6515	0	a	Okay I came to this thinking: A survival fps with a unique sci fi apocalypse which will always get me. I was dead wrong with this game. It is your standard mmorpg piece of garbage layout like warcraft. This shooters gameplay is beyond that of tank controlls. Hard to work with constantly. It should have just went with a more basic combat system then this which would make me want to play it. As you can tell I have not played much as of this moment though I will play more just to adapt the control which turns me off. Graphics are not the worst I have ever seen in my lifetime, but they still could imrpove it. Voice acting is the equivalant of 50' movie with all the bland scenes to talk with. Also being a highwaymen, or tactical in anyway as a bandit is not recomended. You being a sniper you watch your standard patrol for people to pick off, you see two enemy groups attack each other then you pick off the few survivors. All those kills are locked to the other guys character which is absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t if you want to apply any kind of stealth based strategy against enemy players. Also my anti virus, chrome, and even adblock warned me not to go on one of their sites. Which when all three things kind of pop up on you it brings a bit of worry. I am still going to get past the controlls, and see what this game is going to offer. Then if I like it, then I will change my review of this to positive. But so far, red faction is more fun than this. This supposed to be newer with big exploration stuff. Red faction one is a liner fps that is very old.
6516	0	a	I saw this game after i just had upgraded my graphics card, so i decided to give it a try, since it gave me the impression of a F2P Fallout/DayZ-ish game.  Let's say i wasn't really satisfied with what i got.  Pros + Looks cool in the store + Has a good concept + Graphics look acceptable  Cons - Gameplay is slow and boring, also, did i mention repetitive? - Stiff and poor animations - Bullet sponge enemies - Severely confusing interface - Wonky combat and is nothing like what it's advertised - Probably a few more here that i forgot, i may add those later, we'll see  Summary/TL;DR Do you like RPG games where enemies are constantly higher level than you and thus soak up RPG rounds like it's candy? Then get this game.  If you don't like what i described above, don't waste the hard drive space, not even to try it out
9240	1	a	its really fun its like fallout 3 and skyrim put together, with a little bit of R.A.G.E thrown into the mix, the makers did a great job. you dont need a very powerful pc to play but even on lowest detail its still about halo 2 graphics
6517	0	a	It's a good game, but there is seriously so much empty space. If you get stuck out in the middle of nowhere, good luck taking hours to trek back to civilization. There aren't enough fast travel pods, there should be one in each of the towns. The graphics belong in an early 2000's title, the story is good though! But if they did full voice acting for the intro mission, they should've stuck with voice acting for their NPCs in the actual main game.   It takes way too long to progress past the first map, if you don't play for too long you'll quickly fall behind your friends. I do enjoy it though, when I'm in town and interacting with other players. Role playing is fun! In fact, I run a clan, but there's another problem related to that. Because of the semi-good, mixed quality of this game, there isn't exactly a flood of new players. The community's population flounders, and other players rather shoot or run away from you than talk or join your party. I was going to give this game a recommendation but my mind changed after writing for awhile.  And the missions, the MAJORITY of the missions are the most basic of fetch and kill quests. Kill this many thing, collect this many thing, kill this many things then collect their stuff. The market is rigged, combat is cardboard, and missions overflow the queue. I really wish I could enjoy this game, and I could if they fixed the issues! I hope they do fix them.
9242	1	a	This is probably the BEST game i've ever played! I love Fallen Earth! Well good!
6518	0	a	This game is so lagging i cant play it. It just crashes everytime i walk. Game gods FIX THIS!!!!!!!!!!
9244	1	a	amazing i love it but everytime i go to change the graphics and restart i goes all grey and i cant play
9246	1	a	Great game, full of options, customization and vast things to do
6519	0	a	nope, just nope, if you wanna use guns prepare to be completely broke throughout
9248	1	a	this game is fun for a while however after you start to get far // the second map you need to pay to have a bigger poket for money and i lost lots of money due to this fact and now you need to pay to get more money making this game allmost no fun in the end.
9250	1	a	Uninstall button works... So that's a plus.  Seriously though, was this made in 1991? Warcraft 2: Orcs and Humans had better graphics and combat mechanics.  No shooting sounds, no walking sounds, barely any sound at all...
6521	0	a	Connection issues up the yin-yang, unappealing visuals/questionable animations, combat/general gameplay is clunky as all hell.  Unless you really like to challenge yourself with the game, I would not recommend this to anyone.
9252	1	a	♥♥♥♥ u game this game is SUPPER GAY so go and ♥♥♥♥ urself with this 
9254	1	a	Pretty bad ♥♥♥ this will hold me over untell fallout 4
6525	0	a	Banned from talking because I said the game isn't worth money.
9256	1	a	Very good game. Sort of like fallout.  jk it's dead
9258	1	a	I like the game, but my tutorial glitched and I can no longer do anything :/ so I might set this one aside for a while
9260	1	a	If you don't care about graphics and want a fun post apocalyptic MMORPG then give this game a try.
9262	1	a	I started it and crashed after touching my mouse...  That never happened, if you like games like Fallout, this is definitely for you! It's always fun whenever you meet other players, especially if they shoot at you. It's mostly PvP, but it's totally possible to avoid this, sometimes PvP doesn't exist. I also love quests and crafting.  I crafted a horse, I crafted some wood, I crafted a horse  I CRAFTED A MOTHER****ING HORSE! 
9264	1	a	Meh i played worst but its ok
6528	0	a	installed game lots of missing sound files ? might be good when they work on it a bit but for me 18 mins was enough to make up my mind that its way off finished for evenen a beta must be pre alpha ♥♥♥♥..............
9266	1	a	this is so cool
6529	0	a	It's an ok game, its a grinding game mostly so you have to be patient in order to play it, but as a game it works, personally I didn't find the storyline to be very interesting and the game was unable to hold my attention.
6530	0	a	When i load the game the textures of the terrain dont load but characters do so everything is just grey. Idk if its cos im using win10
9268	1	a	Game is really good but could use some bug fixing and more Mods active, but other then that it is really fun and you should really try it.
6532	0	a	Ok weres garry seriously wtf they say were he is I CANT FIND HIM
9270	1	a	WOW. DAT GAME LOOKS AWSOME EVEN IT LOOKS LIKE METRO LAST LIGHT!
9272	1	a	For a Free2Play MMO, the playablility is very high. This is definitely worth playing if you enjoy games like 'Fallout'.
9274	1	a	HOLY ♥♥♥♥ my friend bought me fallout 3 (my pc could no handle it) so i was sad and then i saw this i first said this game will suck i bet ya boy was a wrong (99.5/100)
6536	0	a	worst role playing game ever
6537	0	a	You Can't Even Log In To The Game For The First Time.. How Could You Play??  -11/10 ♥♥♥♥er
9276	1	a	The game is great when you play with friends. Me and my buddy's never play the game alone. As soon as we where all home from school/work ect we would play. Goof game when you are with friends
6538	0	a	Game is ALDI
6539	0	a	This game is so lagging i cant play it. It just crashes everytime i walk. Game gods FIX THIS!!!!!!!!!!
9278	1	a	amazing i love it but everytime i go to change the graphics and restart i goes all grey and i cant play
9280	1	a	Buggy as hell, AI is utterly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, don't expect any patches. Only real reason to play this game is for its uniqueness: An MMORPG with Third-person shooter mechanics, and a decent salvage based crafting system.
9282	1	a	For a Free2Play MMO, the playablility is very high. This is definitely worth playing if you enjoy games like 'Fallout'.
9284	1	a	Great Game
9286	1	a	If you can see past the Dated graphics and from time to time, shoddy AI pathing that just doesn't suit FPS gameplay (Melee Mobs tend to Bline straight for you upon being aggroed so you can easily just feed em however many LeAdvil's their heads can take before they OD/drop ^^) however Ranged targets are another story and even some Melee mobs, especially Wild Mutant with special abilities, Friends, or just quick enough to close the gap/ happen to catch you off guard can still make for quite the entertaining Run n Gun/Duck Duck Shoot Engagements.   Throw in, (IMO) HANDS-DOWN one of the BEST/Deepest Crafting Systems i have seen/ yet to be topped STILL to this day - Really depends on if your into having to build EVERY component/aspect of an Item, down to the metal fasteners and handle grips of, say for example a Pistol. Followed by each additional part before being able to Craft said pistol. along with EACH and EVERY bullet you plan to not buy/fire with it -  ONE AVERAGE PISTOL ROUND: Copper/Lead for the casing and actual bullet (which you must mine and refine from mineral Viens and then smelt) along with x amount of Gun Powder (which is another compound chemical mixture and stand-alone Crafting recipe in itself)---  --BUT I MUST SAY-- Taking down a Hostile passerby, Or say one who's going after a chunk of Salvage YOU KNOW contains some goodies you want/or just cleared God Knows what to reach- and you do so with a 50 or so Rounds that YOU dug up and refined from the very earth youre going to put your Enemy 6 Feet under, Delivered by your two Trusty side arms (my personal favorite, Double Revolvers- Roland Deschain/Gilead Style) that you Painstakingly salvaged along with your entire set of equipment-(remembering bits of what it took through to gather that scrap to get that LAST barrel / Cylinder put together-perhaps difficult/delayed by OTHER less favorable PvP encounters) Sinking a few good Headshots while they Choke on the fumes of your hand-crafted poison/napalm Grenade, before eating the Shrapnel of another, much less tasty sort you plucked from your waist- Giving you time to Reload your babies as you duck behind the Dune Buggy (which you didn't certainly didn't get used from any salesman) you arrived in. Which potentially carries among its cargo, any number of extra goodies you might need. Such as the Incendiary slugs you just reloaded with (TOO precious to pump into the average trash, burning holes in your cargo containers of your mount, awaiting eagerly to be used on JUST such an occasion) just before breaking cover to seal the deal----  ---- You THEN loot the school bus you managed to hold the rights from the unlucky scum bag- Refuse and a burnt book... 'Goodies'   But some games just cant compete with some of what Fallen Earth Potentially has to offer. I never was able to land a decent guild back when i played but i imagine if you have a good social/active guild the game has MASSIVE amounts to offer that i never even caught a wiff of. (i toy with reinstalling now and again and think i might here soon) i only wish it would get some more Dev love rather than just Promos/minor upkeep as with a little spit shine this gem could be a real set piece   Every time i install/ play is a treat. the community is really unique and seemingly immortal. always a chunk of new players, mid lvl and vets in what appears to be an on going cycle ive seen last from beta up to maybe just a year ago or so . always someone around, something to do. but its not exactly User Friendly and especially when youre starting for the first time, can seem overwhelming in an unforgiving sort of way of course it has its flaws/ isn't perfect. But once youre IN- theres NO PLACE as can match the Fallen Earth and all it can offer.  For it being F2P and all considered IMO at least, its one of the best mmos you can hope for even out and up against a number of the modern bunch of ShMMOs,its still worth a look. some of them just seem to lack a few of FE's great aspects which is why its ALWAYS fun to revisit- Unique and FUN PvP/PVE along with an interesting world/lore not to mention Faction system to be apart of (along with the community- and the faction fanatics that can bring even MORE to the game via Forum/ your choice of how you plan to go about, well- Everything) there REALLY IS something for everyone here, you just have to be willing to sink your teeth in to get some of the meat.
9288	1	a	This game is awesome! You get to craft items... don't want to ruin the surprise of what though.You complete quests all while trying to figure out your past!   *Update* I have begun playing this game again. While G1 did destroy some great elements of the game. This is still one heck of a game. I'm not one of those people who played this game for the PvP, I was one of those people playing by myself for the story and mainly just because I stunk at PvP :p The population of the game has died off tremendously, but the people in-game are helpful and kind. It's still a game to consider for a couple of pointless, fun hours. Heck, at the very least, download it. It's free, nothing to lose.
9290	1	a	awsome game i love gomes that your free too explore the world and the quests are nice i dont see anything bad with this game other then the garphics i mean they are good but ive seen better but still an amzing very nice and fun game to play
9292	1	a	Amazing story,gameplay is okay you can play it in First persion or thirdpersion.. :) 
6546	0	a	Used to be good but then gamers first bought it. I wondered why they called it gamers first, it should be money's first.
9294	1	a	Post apocalyptic MMO. Great concept. Could use more work but the price is right. Crafting, lots to explore, lots of character progression options.
6551	0	a	What kind of game has all sounds but random yelling off by default?
9296	1	a	awesome game, been playing since before it came on steam.
6552	0	a	First game to be recognized as a trojan (malware) by my antivirus software. That's a big NO for me.
9298	1	a	Quite good for a free game Pro: very creative landscape, props, junkyards made into monuments. Junkyard towns. 8 factions each with their own armor, politics, favorite weapons, enemy. Drive around in your self made motorbike, eventually craft cars, guns, ore extractors. defeat mutants with dual pistols, shotguns, assault rifles, snipers, melee weapons. Interesting quest story, love scavenging and crafting from scraps. Con: Laggy PvP, Ultimate endgame is a horde of meleeing mutants who look the same.
9300	1	a	pretty badass if you ask me 
9302	1	a	If you don't care about graphics and want a fun post apocalyptic MMORPG then give this game a try.
9304	1	a	Actually only played it for 5 minutes and gave up. -----&gt;Install for an hour----&gt;Finally get in game----&gt;Game instantly freezes, BUT WAIT THERES MORE! It unfreezes and then crashes          10/10 slideshow simulator ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
9306	1	a	very good FREE TO PLAY GAME. if you like crafting items this is a must try. Graphics are not great but the lvl system/crafting system works very well. All types of missions to complete. The best part is the open world and the freedom to choose you'r own skill set not have the path force onto you as a player. You need to read throgh the missions not just start shouting the mission bugged becasue they did not read what to do. Some mission need you to open ur pack and use the item but some just dont get that. Then you can set ur own crafting projects i have set my self many in the past from making 5 motorcycles keys to making 20 AVT keys. Can spend hours just building up your supplys to keep crafting line filled up. At first it may feel overwhelming but stick with it and you start to see the rewards.
9308	1	a	Fun game I recommend it because it will keep you busy for hours and its like a poor mans Fallout
9310	1	a	The game is amazing. I love it. However the mods are so up their own asses and they threaten to ban people for the most stupid things ever. I was having some lag and didn't see my messages sending, so I did it again twice. It sent a total of three times in a span of 2-3 minutes, and the mod Artemis Six was threatening to ban me for being a spammer... Even though my message was a legitimate question about the game. By all means, play the game, just stay away from chat.  EDIT: I changed to recommended. I had originally said not recommended because of that mod but I added her to my ignore list and everybody else is just great. I guess as will all things, there will always be the few ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ players.
6555	0	a	Patch installer stops at 69 % so i can't install the whole game!  10/10 would patch again.
6556	0	a	This game may have been great when it was released. But now it's very buggy, clangy and not that fun. I couldn't manage myself to play much of it. It didn't feel good at all. Perhaps a sequele with improved mechanics and less bugs would be good.  Even tough, it's a F2P. So why not just give it a try? Perhaps you'll like it.
9312	1	a	why not
9314	1	a	Nice little crafting based MMO. Kind of addicting.
6557	0	a	This is by far, my favorite game on steam. The graphics rival many of the triple A titles made today, and im sure will contine to do so for many years. The questing and fighting system is very entertaining. The leveling and skill point system is very refined.   Oh...I thought this was fallout. This game is ♥♥♥♥, dont get it.
6558	0	a	Free and waste of anyones time
9316	1	a	If you like Fallout, Mad Max, and you like MMOs than this is your type of game.
9318	1	a	Amazing game just had to uninstall because was unable to get dlc content
9320	1	a	Great MMO/RPG/FPS game, amazing graphics and fun.  RECOMENDO ESTE CABALO LINDO RITO GOMES !!!
9322	1	a	a Fantastic post apocalyptic mmorpg. one of the greatest crafting/skill systems ive ever seen. Very easy to understand. Immensly complicated for new users i would say you should ask for help in chat all the time. in any case at least once every ten seconds.   10/10 would craft again.
9324	1	a	Great MMO/RPG/FPS game, amazing graphics and fun.  RECOMENDO ESTE CABALO LINDO RITO GOMES !!!
9326	1	a	I &lt;3 you G1. And this game is rather monotonous. Still nice though. Instead of sleeping pills or such. Works.

6561	0	a	Slaughtered an anthropologist with my bare hands before getting prompted to upgrade. 10/10.
6562	0	a	was soll ich sagen, das game macht einfach spass. 100% recommendation.  edit 30.04.2016 the game itself is not bad, but sadly i have to retract my recommendation in the form, that i can't recommend this game anymore. and i will describe why.   after i played for 3.000 + hours in this game i all of a sudden couldn't log in the game anymore. after i contacted the support from gamersfirst, i got an email saying that i did something against their AGB. but the funny fact is, that i didn't played for several weeks if not month. so a. they got fooled from kids or b. they are mad. because i didn't got any information, what i should have done.  so after several further emails between the support from gamersfirst and me, i can't recommend this game anymore.   and i want to give everyone the good advice, not to invest any money in this game, because you can be kicked from this game for no reason. and if you ask for information, you only get preformulated emails, saying always the same, that you did something against their AGB. but you don't get any information, what specific you should have done. so in the end, everyone can say something against you, and you will get banned no matter, if you have payed for the game or not. luckily i 'only' payed like 20 € for this game. this is sad, but i'm glad, i didn't payed more like many others did and do.  so i hope, this information is a good advice for you and you will take care if you want to play this game.
6563	0	a	updates take a year ...
9330	1	a	Ok with now over 3,000 Hours played i think i can do a Review that is Accurate. First off i have seen this game go from Ok, to Bad and back again many of times. YES the player base is kinda small but in other means this game is Quite amazing. Just think of the Crafting you can do. you gotta go collect all the mat's you need in order to craft ( Its my biggest reason i still play ) But other than crafting you have PvE Events every Hour. You can summon bosses and fight, You have World events you can go participate in, the new OUTPOST zone is alot of fun to tinker with and get the ' UNKOWN Pet and UNKOWN mount ' Which i have and they are great. OR you can just dominate the PvP Aspects of this game. Their is so much to do in this game Just do one thing   Give it a Try ( ITS FREE for gods sakes ! ) Its a very confusing game at the beggining but once you get the controlls down its such a amazing Game. I Just know you will like the game if you like any of the following  1. Crafting 2. PvE 3. PvP 4. World Events 5. Faction's  Oh im rambling now just go try it, its free and just amazing !
6564	0	a	All right heres the list of pros and con:   Pros:   - Abstract gameplay controls (Could be a con but it too me makes it more fun and challenging)  - Customizable aviatar  - Non-restrictive   Cons:    - When a Required Mission Glitches you have to reset everything and create a new account  - There are restrictive options ( like 1st person to 3rd person and others of the sort)  - The screen is too cramped with uneeded boxes  Others:   - Gun animation sucks but no biggy it was pretty good for its time in 2011  - Some of its gameplay looked like it was a powerpoint project for a game design class       ~~~ Note ~~~   This is my game experience and your likings are most likly not not like mine
6565	0	a	This game didn't get an 8.5/10 on IGN, it got 81/100 - Liars. GG
9332	1	a	Me and my step son played this seperately and enjoyed it . But now we are playing it together and its even better now we are in a team. And thoroughly enjoying the experiance of helping each other in the gameplay and crafting each other gear guns and all sorts of weapons .
9334	1	a	I have played Fallen Earth off and on since its F2P launch. The game hasnt changed too much since then, other than there only being 3 beginner spawn towns instead of 7 or so. you can still go to those towns though and do the quests and get the free skills and ap from certain lines. I'd rather earn the books by learning the game anyway instead of just buying them for 10 dog legs worth of chips. My last foray into the wasteland was...lonely. Hazmat seemed to have all but dispersed and the Gm's like Tiggz and Dasterd aren't all to active anymore. The player base that remains is pretty friendly, and the help channel, though not enforced anymore to stay only help, is still helpful to those who need it. The gameplay is still fun and the crafting system, though lengthy, is among the best i have seen in any game to date. The only games that match or beat the crafting system is Archage, or Black Desert Online.  I'd definitely recomend this game to anyone. Even if you do not stick with it, it is fun to pass the time wasting bandits and other dump npc enemies with you slugthrower or dual wielded billy clubs. Cheers.
9336	1	a	Great game
9338	1	a	Why is it  Fun, addictive, lots of crafting, missions, many items, factions to join and much more. Good mmo to relax and have a good time, alone or with friends.  Higly reccomended.10/10
9340	1	a	Best MMO game ever, perfect ingame community and its free to play ;)
9342	1	a	Post apocalyptic - Mmorpg - Free-to-play (English) ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  If you dream of a game reminiscent of the Fallout universe, Fallen Earth is doing for you. On horseback, motorcycle, quad or buggy, freedom is complete and the game is an open world.   Crafting - Mutations - Factions PvP - Arenas - PvE - Dungeons Great community and admins are always in game.   Official Website :  http://www.gamersfirst.com/fallenearth/ 
9344	1	a	2012: the year many tribes fans were dissapointed by the thought that Hi Rez didn't have the money to support this game further, and more so by the thought that SMITE was the real money maker. some folks thought that they were abandoning the game to milk the MOBA genre for money...  in some ways, they were right. in others... well, that's the story of today.  yesterday, the game had the aptly named 'Out of the blue' update, which was being made behind the scenes with help from the Tribes community being the testers for... and oh man is it a doozy. everything is fine tuned, or changed up, aside from the maps, which only have the addition of 3 more to the roster, but they're still the same aside from the tweaks that affect the game with the update.  the main thing you need to know is this: the old classes got kicked out. instead, it's simplified to 3 armor types that can pick and choose weapons and gear from thier weight class... if this sounds familiar, that's cause you're a Tribes vet. each of the 3 armor classes have thier upsides and downsides such as the tradeoffs of survivability vs speed, as well as what weapons and gear each class can use (heavies can't bring snipers, and lightweights can't bring heavy weapons or use spinfusor discs or discos/fractal nades). in addition, you can bring 3 weapons, but with another hitch: you are limited to bringing one of each weapon class. (heavies can bring 4 weapons total instead of 3, btw).  TL;DR, this is the best chance to possibly get back into tribes, and give it another go... and before you think of it being P2W... the weapon upgrades are gone. when you unlock a new thing, what you see is what you get.  PS: any exp and gold spent has been refunded, and if you have gold, you will have access to the entire armory.
9346	1	a	When you look down you can see your legs :)
9348	1	a	Maybe you've heard the tales, of how Hi-Rez has abondoned their golden child. Whilst yes this is true, fear not! The gaming community has more than enough leverage to bring them back to this game and these are the reasons why. Don't worry there's a TL;DR at the bottom  Tribes Ascend is as unique as it gets when it comes to FPS. In Tribes the maps are so huge and its ski feature allows you to go so fast and at times you can sometimes feel adrenaline pumping through your veins. Add in the weapons which are mostly splash related and the only way to survive is to be moving. Stand still and you will die- not only does this make it the fastest pace shooter, it also means there will be no campers (except snipers, duh). The tactics, strategies and innovative ideas that spring up as to how to defeat the other side gives the game a lot of depth and lot of shazbots. To list all the features, I'd be writing a PhD, so to make my life easier, there's this:  http://www.hirezstudios.com/tribesascend/home  Just because the game appears dead doesn't mean it's not good already. Sure things will seem a little empty but if enough people read this and enough people get into it, I guarantee we can change things.  All the classes blend together to create a synergy close to perfection and they individually cover so vast an angle that every class is needed and you will always see every class at work in a game. You won't see an entire team of Juggernauts because they'd be easily beaten by a nimble Pathfinder. Every class has it's pros and it's cons, and when put in a team form one mechanised unit that will steamroll the enemy. But you can also be flexible in that you won't have to stick to one class the entire time, you can switch it up. Sneaking in isn't working? Why not go in spinfusor toting and blow everything up? You don't have to invest too much into any one class and personally I find some of the starting weapons are amazing once you warm up to them. Spend hours trying them out. And if you like it, tell your friends to sign up, get the world united to bring this back, eh?  And of course, there's the one quintessential aspect of the game I haven't explored a lot. The fact that it's free! This is a lifesaver for anyone-stingy or not and oh boy am I glad it's free. For such an amazing game, so unique and so complex I was dumbfounded at first when I found out it was free. There are those who say it's pay to win but don't take any of that nonsense. NONE of the weapons are 'better' than the starting ones, they're all different and suit different people or different scenarios. For the one class you may prefer blowing people to kingdom come with the satisfaction of seeing the killing blow, having your enemies blasted out of existence with you a mile away or gunning them down while chasing them and see them try to escape. With the multitude of weapons and items available, Tribes offers you the chance to try them ALL out in the practice mode so you can set your sight on a new weapon and grind and shoot your way to the top with a goal in mind. And when you've gotten every weapon you possibly want, or every item there is available, you don't stop or run out of steam *badumtsi* because you're always trying to be the best and the adrenaline rush, the satisfaction of a Blue Plate, a headshot, a melee or anything is reward enough.  TL;DR Not a moment in the game will you be bored and hours will fly by so quickly. So if you've played this before, but have felt defeated by Hi-Rez, get back on your feet or if you're completely new, go headfirst in and have a little faith. Login and start. Get your friends to jump in too. The more people we get, the more of the gaming community there are, the great ther chance of getting Hi-Rez's attention and bring this thing back. So spread the word, bring people into it, tell the gaming community and the world- even tell that random stranger on the road to. This game didn't deserve to end so quickly, so let's give it another shot. 
9350	1	a	Feels like a brand new game with this new update. Really fun and enjoyable experience now that there are only 3 classes instead of 9. I would say everything that was once wrong with this game is now fixed. Probably one of the best skill based shooters out right now. Totally worth a try if you enjoy a very fast paced game.
9352	1	a	I've been replaying this recently and loving it (I use the non-steam client) so I thought I'd repost this recommendation now that the character limit has gone.  ====== So far the best iteration of Tribes since Tribes 2. What's more its free to play so you've got no excuse not to give it a try.  Skiing For those who don't know the series Tribes offers team based gameplay with one of the best movement mechanics in arena style FPS called skiing. It combines physics, jetpacks, the environment and the skill of the player to have you rocketing around the map at the speed of sound and makes for some excellent chases in capture the flag type scenarios and great combat that has you estimating trajectories of projectiles and players to produce some of the most epic trickshots you'll see in any game.  Classes It also has a really nice class system that has subtle class differences which are exaggerated by player role choices in game. The subtlety results in a much more natural role selection basic much more on strategy rather than the 'I'm playing the heavy-defender class therefore I only defend'  Map Design One thing that also stands out to me is that I think the map design is beautiful for an arena game. While they do share some common features on the whole each map feels unique and have loads of great little details to bring them to life.  FTP Finally for those who are nervous about free to plays being pay to win (as I was until recently) Tribes: Ascend feels like its got the right balance of paying giving you enough perks to make it worth it (which is important if you want the game to stay alive) but without being an essential element to play and kick ♥♥♥♥. Rather than money opening up bigger scarier guns, it seems to open up alternative roles to play within the game, all of which are available over time when playing the game for free.  Downsides The only thing missing from this wonderful iteration of the classic franchise is the modding that came with Tribes and Tribes 2. I remember my brother and I having a whale of a time as kids playing with a lot of mods and user generated maps that added a whole ton of content to the game. While it's obvious why this can't work in a FTP game, it's a bit of a shame. Hopefully though, if HiRez studios are successful they'll be enough interest to keep them adding official content to the game to keep us all keen.  How to try it? Give it a go! It's free. Sign up and download at  https://account.hirezstudios.com/tribesascend/♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥=1899863&amp;utm_campaign=email  and for those new to the series, or who just need a bit of revision there is a great inforgraph here  http://puu.sh/w7SC  which gives you a bunch of handy pointers to get you going!  !!! UPDATE !!! It's a bit of a shame but the game has been pretty much abandoned by the dev's and from what I've read the community is basically dead. It's still free and it's still good when you've got a game, but be careful before investing any money into the game.
9354	1	a	Hi. I am a bit torn apart with this game. I'll recommend it but I don't like it. Let me explain.  I used to play Tribes Ascend ALOT a few years ago. Then I let it go and went to play other timesinks and forgot my characters name, password and even the email I used to log on to my account with. So now that I heard that there was a new patch and people got interested into the game again, I gave it a chance again and made a new account. At start I felt like a dirty dirty man as it almost felt like sealclubbing to own scrubs under level 8, but I knew it wouldn't last forever and when I would get to level8+ matches, I would get my ♥♥♥ handed to me. Thats just how this game goes.  At first I felt that the game was fun again (even thou there wasn't all too many players around), fast, furious and exciting. Hirez had reworked the game thoroughly and removed many aspects of the game and at first I had nothing bad to say about it.   Untill it striked me in one game. Really hard.   Back in the day when I played Tribes Ascend alot, I was the guy in defence. Keeping generator, turrets and radar alive. Giving inventory stations power and fending off enemies from flag. Using my credits to upgrade all those base assets to help the team. Giving the rest of the players a better chance to go and attack and get that flag to our base without fear of loosing our own base to the enemy. I admit that it wasn't easy at times but I was kinda ok at it and I grinded that engineer up to level 28 (50 is max).   -Classes are erased and in their place are just light, medium and heavy loadouts and that's just fine for me. It just makes loadouts more versatile. -Back in the days the generator room was harder to get into and the generator itself couldn't be bombarded from outside with mortars from miles away like in some new maps nowdays. That just makes defending the generator so much harder. -The upgrade and credit systems are gone. So the base assets (gen, radar, turrets) will stay underpowered through the whole game and they can be nuked in a matter of seconds by anyone, but repairing still takes ages.  -The perk system is gone. I liked perks. They made the game more versatile and gave player a way to choose his/her own playstyle. I liked to carry more mines and be super heavy or draw my weapon more quickly. I don't care if some or most of them are nowadays placed in the appropriate classes. It takes the diversity away from gameplay as everyone playing a loadout are exactly the same(except gun choices ofc.) -Vehicle heath reduced greatly.  It just seems like the game is nowadays more about it's speed and only it's speed. Go for the flag/kill and everything else is useless and stupid. The game used to have loads of micro things to do and the game awarded players for filling different roles and now as the credits are gone you only get experience out of the combat. Now there seems to be only the attackers and flag cappers. Defense is useless. Many guns&amp;gear are nowadays useless and even vehicles are pointless to get as they are so weak. In a really fast paced game a slow moving tank doesn't sound like really useful thing in the first place but it used to be a great way harass enemys defence so that the flag capper had easier time to do HIS job. And as the credits are gone and base defending is made nearly impossible, then why bother use the hard earned exp to unlock defensive guns or gear? And why bother unlock other guns to attack as there is a great variety to start with and it is a long way to master any of them anyway. Only thing that is somehow worth of your money and time might be skins. Even exp boosters feel pointless now as it feels like there is so much less to do in Tribes Ascend(unless you get some satisfaction from gaining levels).   But still. I think the game is very good and enjoyable for many people. It's still a great FPS.  But not that great team fps so it's not for me.   ps. sorry for bad grammar and misspelling, English ain't my first language.
9356	1	a	Its like half arena shooter half Tony Hawk Pro Skater
9358	1	a	Updated Review, after 660+ hours put into this game:  [VGTG-VGS]  My all time favourite first person SHAZBOT. You know a FPS game is going to be damn right amazing when you have a speedometer.  This is my go-to game when I am feeling down or I'm raging from other games. Some people have CS, TF2 or Quake. I have VGS. The freedom of motion is amazing, and everything you're doing is so damn fun because of the fun mechanics.  Pros: - free to play; great model; prices have been halved a while ago; ♥♥♥♥ING TRY IT - high skill roof; one of the hardest games to master those plates - skiing - my damn favorite mechanic to have in a game. Frictionless skiing. - jetpacks - goes hand in hand with ^  - all classes are fun - objective-based play; death stats and K/D ratio aren't even in the game - capture that flag with your team or go home - [VGS] commands  http://www.shazinator.com/VSDD+VSTD+VDB+VDE+VNS+VBR+VBE+VGS+VGTT+VSAB+VTW+VGS+VGS+VSAB+VVW+VTN+VGS+VGS+VGQ+VSAF+VAW+VFF+VAD+VGS+VGS+VGTB+VSAF+VAW+VFF+VAD+VED+VFF+VNC+VDB+VGTG+VGW+VGCG  - competitive - GOTTAGOFAST         YouTube™ Video:  Dreaming | A Tribes: Ascend Montage&nbsp;
9360	1	a	Great game, fast paste futuristic first-person shooter. The graphic quality is amazing and the layouts are just beautiful.
9362	1	a	10 Shazbots out of 10.
9364	1	a	Tribes Ascend gets the Game Of The Year reward and a bunch of other good stuff!  Then Smite comes along...  Hi-Rez decides to work on Smite than Tribes Ascend   Why?  $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$   How dead did the game become?  Well, there were no forums, no updates, no customer support... (when you did contact customer support they referred to the game as smite)  The only thing you could do is download the game.   Why not work on Tribes Ascend instead?  Tribes Ascend got Game Of the Year. And what did Smite win? Money?   Has HiRez done something like this before?  Yes. An even older game (but made with the same engine) called Global Agenda is more abandonded than Tribes Ascend. That game is an MMORPG, like Smite (hint hint)   Then, after constant demands from the remnants of the Tribes Ascend community (mostly GOTY edition owners, but also those who liked the game a lot and whose game didn't stop working), HiRez comes out with the 'out of the blue' update!   First off, let's make the original Tribes games free!  Too bad no one liked them, but yay!   Next, let's change the liked class system with a system from the older games: light, medium, and heavy.  Noooo! why would you simplify the class system (which actually overcomplicated it. Now there are a bunch of restrictions, like you cant cloak with the sniper rifle.)   We did this by popular demand.  What popular demand? Those who migrated to Smite or something?   Oh, and all that money you spent on the GOTY edition and all of that gold/silver you used to buy weapons? We refunded it all back.  Great, real great... Now I need to find the weapons I bought before... And they removed GOTY edition? why?   We also removed a bunch of boring weapons and kept the OP ones  Why? My loadouts consisted mostly of that!!!   We also added something called the 'all weapons pack'  Oh, I see now... A variant of the P2W GOTY edition pack without the loadout, class, and perk unlock (which were removed or changed to make GOTY edition not much more than all weapons)   We also added 2 new maps from previous Tribes games  Yay, although the previous games weren't that good...   Thank you for playing Tribes Ascend, hope you enjoy the new Tribes, have a nice day, blablabla outro stuff  Really? Really?  NOW!  Tribes Ascend has reverted to the remnant player community it was after the shutdown. With only a few servers with actual players, Tribes Ascend has only gone down. Nice job, HiRez.
9366	1	a	Only good for a few days then it gets pretty repetetive...
9368	1	a	the best game you never played
9370	1	a	you won't find a fps with this high of a skill ceiling. you also won't find a fps with combat this fast pace. there still isn't any game that comes close to what this game dose and when you finally pull of that impossible shot you feel like a god.   It's a pity that its community has almost died out were something like tf2 is still strong after 10 years.  its free play it.
9372	1	a	Played it.  Thought it was supposed to be Hi-Rez's free version of Advanced Warfare.  9/10. Would be 10 if it wasn't for Hi Rez dumping it. And The graphics (OK)   15/08/2015 (Edited)  Have they actually come back? Has Hi-Rez come back???
9374	1	a	Too good Relaxing(if you want it to be) In your face invigorating(if you want the fast pace) B e a utiful Explosive team play So good
9376	1	a	HiRez announces continues support, additional maps, bug fixes soon. This is not a troll!
9378	1	a	Great game now dead, no one plays it, I wish there was because this game was my life for a good while even though I lost 1 account I kept going because this game was that good and PVP soon much fun the game modes were awesome and capture the flag was the best thing I ever played in my life and the weapons were amazing each having a different function to learn i.e. slower velocity slow firing fast shooting oh and let's not forget the tanks and the interceptors..... Hi-Rez you fools left this game and it was going so well now it's dead and no one plays it anymore not even me this is one of those games I will always love just as the ones before it........ RIP
9380	1	a	This game is like jesus being born then orphaned by his parents and the lord. And then locked in the basement, and starved. While his friend Judas moves into his old room and throws parties with all his old friends and makes sure jesus hears him.
9382	1	a	This is how CTF aught to be in a first person shooter.
9384	1	a	Loved this game.Never spent a penny and got hours of high intensity gameplay out of it.  So glad Hi-Rez is continuing development now.
9386	1	a	The game is great but the devs did abandon it. Im gonna recomend it because i think people should get a chance to play it before the servers are shut down. But thankfully they didnt give up on the Tribes series because Tribes Universe is in development as of right now. Hopefully they don't cancel it like past games they were making. I hear its gonna be like Planetside 2 in Tribes form.
9388	1	a	This is one of the only Free-to-play shooters that I can actually play and enjoy. It's easy enough to pick up and play for a bit, the combat feels balanced and the skiing aspect makes it unique enough to stand out from any other FPS.
9390	1	a	Update inbound. HYPE FOR THE TRIBES REVIVAL! hirez has another team working on tribes again. heres hoping to the game coming back real big. either way its an amazing game and i recommend it to everyone
9392	1	a	The best first person sonic trick-shot sim out there.  10/10  has jetpacks
9394	1	a	A brilliant resurrection of a classic. Speed and skill-driven mechanics separate Tribes from other modern shooters.
9396	1	a	The most dynamic game I've played. Today, developers officially confirmed the rumor : Tribes is again supported, the game will get new maps and patches. Feel free to download !!!
9398	1	a	Just in case you're wondering let me get straight to the point,  - Not P2W - The servers are still online - Weak laptops can run this game at minimal or low - Fast paced - You do need an account but it will only take a min - The devs did NOT abandon the game and its still active - You don't have to pay anything to win the game - Oh yeah and it's Free
9400	1	a	This game aint dead.
9402	1	a	Its a great fast paced FPS and TPS
9404	1	a	10/10  Would restart and reinstall again  No seriously. I really want to play it. BUT. I was installing PRE-REQS. and it said on or more failed....to be honest, I thought this pop up adobe thing was from a video. DAMMIT. well, atleast I've figured out how to do it.   ... Oh yeah. I'm ment to recommend it or something... RIGHT. ohkay. Yeah Flying thingies yeah okay Got it. I recommend this game. Especialy after they just resurected it.
9406	1	a	This is a fast past FPS game that requires teamwork, the game sets it self apart from other FPS games out there. You will ski around at speed outmaneuvering each other.  Shooting requires a whole other way of aiming than any other shooter you probably know. You need quick reaction, intuition and a steady aim while you your self is on the move.  This game is easy to play, but freakishly hard to master. Early on you will be steamrolled all over the place by the skilled players (even on lowranked server due to high-ranked players re-rolling to play on low ranked servers). It will be frustrating, but with a bit of practice you will learn how to move to prevent being trashed all the time. Movement is really, really, really, important. Btw, Did I mention how important movement is to survive in the game? Standing still will turn you into mincemeat in no time (camping = death). In the normal random game you can do whatever you like, more or less, but if you join a “PickUpGroup (play a pug) game, you will be put in the setting of competitive gaming. It is recommended and a ton of fun.  They will teach you how to play properly. Just tell them that you are new and need to learn ;)   Try it out. It is worth it.  The downside…… Hi-Rez got greedy. When their DotA clone turned profitable, they removed all support for Tribes. The game is now dead in the eye of the maker and only the players are left to fence for them self.  And because of this, the game is in a decline and will die out sooner or later, depending on how stubborn the game-community is.     
9408	1	a	It's BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACK!
9410	1	a	it was great while it lasted i hope that they will host some proper servers for it again
9412	1	a	I think I might try out this game. Seems like it'll be fun.
9414	1	a	Came in, saw it, downloaded it, opened it, made an account, picked a guy with a gun, saw another guy with a gun, got shot by the other guy with a gun, fiddled around with different classes for a half hour, took stealth, stole the flag, spent three minutes skiing away from a bunch of guys with guns who wanted to kill me, got killed, respawned, did it again.   If you like guns, skiing, and much killing and respawning, then you'll want to give this a play.  8/10 for the idea, 2 off for needing a little polish.  10/10 when I remembered it has jetpacks.
9416	1	a	Everytime I reach speeds of over 200 MP/h on my skis, my ♥♥♥♥♥ get's really cold and soft like cheese that's been left in the sun for 2 hours. 8.5/10
9418	1	a	Great game, sad to see it age this badly. If you are considering playing to play this game please do!
9420	1	a	It's good again guys.  Quick Pro-Con Lost  PRO: -The movement. I mean god damn, does it put games like Titianfall and the latest cawadoody entry to shame. The entire game is played with an exo-suit that makes you feel like you've got an ACME rocket-powered skatboard welded to your feet at all times. With the hilly structure of nearly all of the maps, it's like the worlds most dangerous skate park - but with guns and Capture the Flag.  -The weapons. Don't expect too many traditional pew pews in Tribes. This game is fought primarily with high-velocity explosive frisbees. Spinfusors are the name of the game, and learning to use one is easy, but eyeballing the trajectory, distance, and speed of your enemy as they go screaming across the map and scoring a hit is a ♥♥♥♥♥ to master. Weapon variety is enough to keep you happy, and each one has it's own little purpose.  -The classes. Old Tribes players will disticntly remember nine in total, but with recent updates it's been shaved down to three; light, medium, and heavy. Don't worry, this is probably my favorite new feature, as it allows more creativity in creating them. Classes are simple, light means go fast, heavy means big armor, and medium is a balance between the two. With the new additions, you can really carve out your niche in the match. Want to have some heavy offensive ordinance AND be able to deploy a turret now? You can. Want to carry a crossbow and a Jackal at the same time? No more class restriction on that. Chaingun AND Heavy spinfusor AND Fractal Grenade? Yep, that too. The sky's the limit.  -The graphics. Not on par with a triple-A 2016 release but still really pretty if you crank everything up to max, and can still be set low enough to play on a toaster. The gameplay is the focus here.  -It's free. What more could you want?  SO-SO -Cannot be played through Steam, so your favorite dank meme name is a no-go. -Serves can get a bit underpopulated, but that's not bad in my opinion becaue you see a few famailiar faces from time to time.   CON: -Learning curve is a bit frusturating. 20 hours in and I'm still getting my behind kicked. -May be dead as a doornail in a year or two. -I can't think of anythig else.
9422	1	a	Tribes: Ascend is a really good game, and since it is Free To Play, you should really just try it out. Its biggest flaw, is the system of microtransactions, as the game seems to strongly urge you, to spend real money. Nevertheless you will be able to get significant enjoyment out of it, even if you don't pay. The most important thing about Tribes: Ascend, would be that it is a very skill-based shooter, comparable to Counter-Strike, as it is sufficiently easy to learn, but extremly hard yet rewarding to master.
9424	1	a	good game but seriously i hate HIrez game is just dead it was fun while it lasted
9426	1	a	The worlds best shooter.
9428	1	a	It's kind of like dust II but different
9430	1	a	Why wouldn't you get this game? It's amazing. I admit it can be a bit grindy to get all the weapons and perks unlocked, but there are so many good points that overpower the one bad point. It's easy to run. It has great gameplay. Quite a few different game-modes. And 9 different classes to play as. 9! 3 heavy, 3 medium, 3 light. My favourites are the infiltrator (light) and the doom-bringer (heavy). Get this game if you like free FPS games.
9432	1	a	If you enjoy playing inside of microwaves and putting scissors in your mouth then this is the perfect game for you. But in this game it is really easy to find friends beacuase there is only about 12 people playing this game.   So please dont be like snowy and think this game is dont dead.
9434	1	a	Pretty awesome for a free game. I like it.
9436	1	a	It's ok, I guess.
9438	1	a	  beautiful maps designed but not players :(
9440	1	a	Loyal playerbases don't like change, even though sometimes its for good.  There are a lot of bad reviews after the big patch but it did fix a lot of problems for the casual player. Most flaws and imbalances from before were treated with a 'lol git gud' response from the elite and toxic playerbase that was pushing newbies away.   Its a great time to play again, its balanced, rewards skill, and enough players in any region to get a good pick up game.   8/10
9442	1	a	Way past cool
9444	1	a	Tribes is a class based FPS shooter. Jet packs, and fast paced action is what make this game a blast!  Awesome game, would Shazbot again!
9446	1	a	Used to be a good game, then it died. RIP Tribes
9448	1	a	Fun To Play,Addictive,I love the skiing system but... i hate the players... whenever you kill them they say OMFG NOOOB!! and the unbalanced matches where one team has new players and the other has like veterans. those are my only complains.  Also, IM DOWNLOADING IT AGAIN, ♥♥♥♥ YEAH, ITS GONNA COME BACK TO LIFE! hopefully  Edit: Fixed some awfull grammar and punctuation errors, i can't believe how ♥♥♥♥ my english was when i wrote this review
9450	1	a	Just started playing today. It's fast paced and similar to many good arena shooter. YOU CAN SKI THIS GAME IS AWESOME (and it's free)
9452	1	a	AD/HD FPS - If that's your cup of tea. I like it for now and then.
9454	1	a	This game, dare i say, is probably one of the best first person shooters F2P I have played to date. The graphics are good, the gameplay is incredible and teamwork is essential. Controlling the massive speeds of 200 Kph is intense at first but soon becomes second nature as your main focus is blowing the heads off enemies using multiple different guns. This was my favourite, topping that of Planetside 2 and TF2 for a while. This game was never too popular which was a absolute shame! No one really played it because it wasn't advertised well enough i think. If you're looking for a adrenaline pumped action fps where everything is pushed to the limit, this is a game for you.
9456	1	a	I love this game when I downloaded it and played it for the first time i played it for 6 hours straight Loved it
9458	1	a	Great game! Everyone should deffiently try it out!
9460	1	a	IT HAS JETPACKS AND PEOPLE THAT TURN INTO ROBOTS WHEN THEY DIE!
9462	1	a	Srsly fun. Guys.... srsly.
9464	1	a	Rest in Peace.
9466	1	a	Now more like Tribes 2.  Only three sets of armour to choose from and create a bunch of loadouts like the old days.   Brave move by the dev to dramatically change this game so much back in December 2015. Though I'm sure those who grew accustomed to it would not be very happy with the massive reset.
9468	1	a	One of the best shooters in the world  Like seriously its worth a try  nothing beats rolling around at the speed of sound
9470	1	a	IT HAS JETPACKS AND PEOPLE THAT TURN INTO ROBOTS WHEN THEY DIE!
9472	1	a	This game was and still is the game that saved pc gaming for me. I love this game (even when I played on a toaster) so much and the newest update changed the game in a way that I could reimagine the whole game. I recommend this game if you want to have a fast paced game and countless hours of highspeed battles travelling in ridicoulus speeds.

9476	1	a	Srsly fun. Guys.... srsly.
9478	1	a	Great game (i love that you can jump in and out of games without jeprodizing your acount)
9480	1	a	It's fast, it's fun, it's freaking TRIBES!!!!!!!!!!1
9482	1	a	FInally fixed and no longer completely pay to win.
9484	1	a	A great game that actually takes skill. There are hardly any hitscan weapons, and the few that are are mostly a necessity (like the Sniper Rifles). It also is a great looking game with equally great gameplay.  20/10 [VGS] Shazbot!
9486	1	a	Tribes Ascend made me feel like I used to back in 2001 when I played Tribes 2. That's a good thing. One of the best, most fun PC fps's to come out in a long time. 
9488	1	a	Some games die young, and this one died cause Smite came out.
9490	1	a	THIS WAS THE BEST GAME EVER FOR ME.  THEN SMITE HAPPENED...  HI-REZ ABANDONED THIS MASTERPIECE FOR THAT ♥♥♥♥ING ♥♥♥♥ GAME CALLED SMITE...  BUT NOW IT IS THEIR BEST DECISION TO SUPPORT THIS AWESOME GAME!
9492	1	a	when you look down you can see your feet
9494	1	a	It's fast, it's fun, it's freaking TRIBES!!!!!!!!!!1
9496	1	a	Cool game :) More action, Awesome Graphic and Nice arms + places :D  By:#CRISTIAN1ELITE
9498	1	a	Was fun for a while, it got old though.
9500	1	a	Great game. The developers cut development for it, leaving no mods or community add-ons.
9502	1	a	I'm so desperate for entertainment that I reinstalled this garbage game, but luckily, after completing the download, I encountered an (apparently) extremely common error with the launcher that couldn't be fixed without deleting and redownloading the game. This is a bit like curling up with your copy of The Fountainhead only to have it burst into flames the moment you open it.  Never before has a company so readily saved me from my own bad decisions. Thanks Hi-Rez!
9504	1	a	Great game, something really different from ♥♥♥♥ like COD and these base shooters. Runs on Unreal Engine 3. Requires registration.
9506	1	a	Tribes is a Free2Play First Persion Shooter with a unique gameplay twist: the main means of transportation are your jetpack and your ski. Yes, you read that right: your (energy-) ski! This aspect defines the entire game and poses the main difference to other games. The Tribes series was always centered around the gamemode 'Capture the Flag' and offers fast and frantic battles, where aiming is as important as maneuvering the terrain:         YouTube™ Video:  Tribes Ascend (BETA) Montage - LANDIS&nbsp;
9508	1	a	the dearest victim of the modern game industry i love you tribe
9510	1	a	This is an amazing game, extremely balanced and fair. Its F2P system is absolutely functional and logical, as it easily allows for the more determined players to have access to all weaponry by merely playing it without grind, yet, if haste is needed, Steam offers the Game of the Year Edition which unlocks everything and is pretty cheap, and once in a while it can be acquired for a ludicrously low price due to the famous sales Steam is known for. I don't have the proper words to convey how great this game is: it's unique, SKILL-BASED, requires precise team coordination for competitive matches. This is a masterpiece and its originality sets it apart from its own genre. It's a must for FPS lovers and hardcore players that value practice and skill.
9512	1	a	I don't care if they left the game, and dont update it more.... Im happy that you still can play it, and it is better to leave it, then if it wasn't made? It is a very funny FPS game with a LOT of speed and that favors people that are fast on the keybord, and upgrade your reaction. :-) But, i got a bug that i cant play it :-( but i have played it and it was fun as hell!
9514	1	a	This is the Halo of PC Games. Fast-paced 3D combat over large maps for people who dont like standing to aim. Victory requires teamwork and cohesive choices. If you have a rig that can run this; try it
9516	1	a	Having played 2000+ hours, I can say that this game is the best FPS-Z title to date. The only other game I have ever played this much was quake 1 mega team fortress
9518	1	a	Very fun and fast paced you should try it.
9520	1	a	Tribes Ascend is a fun game to play but sadly there are some downfalls to the game that I have noticed. Hirez no longer does a lot of development to the game, it takes a very long time to find a game if you are in a party with friends, takes some time to rank up to unlock new gamemodes. Over all this is a fun game to play and there are a lot of choices to go with for your different classes. So if you are looking for a good free future like FPS then this is for you!
9522	1	a	Oh gods Tribes Ascend. This would be one of the best games I've ever played if it weren't for the ridiculously high skill requirement. It isn't even a learning curve, it's a time commitment. You have to first get a feel for Skiing - the primary means of getting around a map - then you have to learn how to use at least one of the game's weapons, all of which are hard to use. Mastering one of the game's weapons is akin to earning your 5th degree black belt, both in terms of effort and timecomitted to it, as well as the effectiveness that results from your mastery. I have yet to come close to even becoming adept with one of the weapons in this game. Another thing is that the lag, even though it is miniscule and very well covered up by lag compensation, will MESS WITH YOU. A 0.2-second delay in firing your Spinfusor means the difference between scoring a direct hit and accidentally killing yourself in the explosion. Another thing is that the class balance is a bit off-kilter; Medium and Heavy classes can easily travel 9/10ths the speed of a Light class, and their weapons can one-hit Light classes with splash damage. Whereas, the Light classes have to score nothing but direct hits to even come close to leaving an engagement with their lives. It's not a huge issue; the Light's job is to run around sewing chaos, not engaging directly, but it can get under your fingernails when a misfired shell kills you instantly after you walk out of the spawn area.  Besides that the game really is deservent of the title of 'The fastest FPS on the market.' With practice, you can easily reach racecar speeds of 300 KPH on a regular basis; I've seen some people get up to a supersonic 600 KPH when they try. The skill-based weapons are both rewarding and aggravating at the same time; you can go an entire match without a single kill or assist because of how bad your aiming skills are, and the next match you can rack up 10 mid-air kills with grenades. It's entirely dependent on how good you are, how bad the lag is, and whether or not the gods of hilarious killshots are on your side. The team balance isn't stellar, but there is at least an algorithm that exists to balance out teams. All of the gamemodes are stupid fun, and teamwork does matter even if you hardly ever get it. This game is a proponent of the 'Awesome Moment'; you know, those time where there is 1 minute left in the game, you're playing as Pathfinder, the most fragile class in the game, and you skii into the enemy's flag room, kill 3 guys in one shot, grab the flag right before the enemy team captures theirs, kill the flag carrier and return your flag, skii all the way home dodging missiles and AA fire as you deftly slide up and down ramps and hills, and just before the game ends, you cap the flag and tie the game. Much Shazbot will be heard.
9524	1	a	THE BEST GAME EVER! For a free game it easily rivals TF2. I absolutely love the open worldness and the weapons. PLAY THIS GAME!
9526	1	a	I highly recommend this shooter, if you are new an easy way to get out the gate without playing for XP is to buy the GOTY edition which unlocks every weapon, class and perks right from the start.
9528	1	a	One of the best games I have ever playd but the sniper needs revision
9530	1	a	This is by far the best fps game ive ever played. There are tons of different gamemodes that are great, and you can choose from different vehicles. I for 1 feel like this game would destroy all others i &lt;3 tribes ascend and there are lots of classes to choose from and that i will not tell you... why are you still reading reviews? PLAY THIS EPIC GAME!!!!!!!
9532	1	a	please kill me for the love of god
9534	1	a	One of the most fast-paced and skil-based games I've played. Kills are much more satisfying than in something like COD or Battlefield. Although there is a high learning curve, you will still be having fun from the very beginning. Also, this game will improve your FPS skill greatly! Leading targets, strafing, keeping the target in sight, you'll never have problems with it again. If you're up for a challenge, get this game!
9536	1	a	tribes ascend was intended to be a rebirth of the legacy that existed in Starsiege tribes, and tribes 2, now, anyone who experianced Starsiege tribes in it's prime loved the mod community far more than the base game, tribes ascend, has become what the base game SHOULD be like, but keeps itself closed from being anything more by not allowing any modifications other thna what the original devs put in... even requireing microtransations for server hosting, all servers in this game are running off microtransations, hi-res seems to have dubed themselves through wht releasing new content with the 'Game of the Year Edition' giving all content, the game isn't pay to win, but will require you to put some good hours in and proper spending of your points to get a good setup. a good game, but could be so much more, fun community and not for the novice fps player
9538	1	a	If you think COD is fast, get a load of this...
9540	1	a	Tribes Ascend is a fun game to play but sadly there are some downfalls to the game that I have noticed. Hirez no longer does a lot of development to the game, it takes a very long time to find a game if you are in a party with friends, takes some time to rank up to unlock new gamemodes. Over all this is a fun game to play and there are a lot of choices to go with for your different classes. So if you are looking for a good free future like FPS then this is for you!
9542	1	a	Note: This review is David Jaffe approved! -  http://www.destructoid.com/review-tribes-ascend-226280.phtml 
9544	1	a	This game is just all fun around awesome. I was a huge fan from the first Tribes game all the way up to this one. Give it a go!
9546	1	a	rip 0nyxheart
9548	1	a	If you played Tribes or Tribes 2 you will love this game. If you haven't played those you will still love it just remember the motto 'I wanna go fast'
9550	1	a	Tribes: Ascend is a free-to-play game (though money is needed for some features) which surpasses all expectations one could have for a shooting game. Most shooting games put the players in a slow-paced environment where the desire to move quicker than 7 mph is not an option. In this game, if you're moving slower than that, it's because you're standing still.  This game requires a good aim, reflex, tracking, and anticipation. Most of your gameplay will require that you anticipate. There are enormous hills all over the place, and between the 'skiing' and jetpack abilities, there's really no way you'll have to NOT anticipate before shooting.  It also features several cameos and essences I really enjoy, even one relating directly to Sonic the Hedgehog (the best video game series ever). Several voices and statements and whatnot from prior games were dragged into this game, and better yet, you can control the exact statement you use, unlike previous games in the Tribes series.  As a First-Person Shooter game, I give it a 10/10, hands down. Most shooters I play get around 5/10. As a video game altogether, I give it 9/10, graphics and physics and originality and whatever else factors all considered. From a PERSONAL standpoint, I give it a 6/10. It's something I like to play, but not very often. Games are meant for fun, aaaaaaaaaand that's how I tend to rate games on a personal level. This game is a LOT of fun, especially to someone who hasn't played a Tribes game in 9 years or so when they find out this one is free. VGW
9552	1	a	I highly recommend this shooter, if you are new an easy way to get out the gate without playing for XP is to buy the GOTY edition which unlocks every weapon, class and perks right from the start.
9554	1	a	It's a cool game
9556	1	a	I love this game
9558	1	a	This is a game of motion, where every strategy employs a method of movement. And what movement it is: sliding down hills, soaring with a jetpack, strafing over the landscape. It is easy to enjoy, yet rewards skill. The pace is as fast or slow as you choose to play it, with weapons for the ponderous and nimble.   Furthermore it is free, and the graphics are lovely. The balance is well struck, and you can easily earn new classes to play that expand choice via specialization rather than simply increasing power. I love it.
9560	1	a	One of the best FPS, with a really unique concept of 'skiing'. Very fast paced and it never gets boring. 
9562	1	a	This game makes my ♥♥♥♥ rock hard!
9564	1	a	THIS GAME IS ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ STUPID SHAUBOTHJNBAU[IT[ AHBT RAGE
9566	1	a	This game is one of the best games out their for first person shooters. It a very fast paced game but is very easy to learn.
9568	1	a	A worthy game for the title of Tribes. 10/10
9570	1	a	Not Bad
9572	1	a	great game but when i upgraded to windows 10 i cant play anymore and that upsets me so please make it compatable with windows 10
9574	1	a	The BEST FPS EVER ! Realy ! And one of the harder ! (have more of 1000 Hours on it) VGCG !
9576	1	a	I wish people played this game :C
9578	1	a	Really fun game.
9580	1	a	Tribes Ascend is fun and non-stop action. I've been playing the Tribes games since the original, this is the best Tribes game out of them all. This is one of my all time favorite games!
9582	1	a	Yeah its an good game simply like TF2 but not the same graphics and even more EVEN driving 3 kinds of vehicles or Capture the flar or team death much to much kinds of games and there is jetpacks and skiing :P so its the best game i ever had   Tip : download it now its free :D
9584	1	a	best F2P shooter on steam. makes a classic cool again. period
9586	1	a	Awesome game afterall, too bad the developers abandon it for (SMITE)
9588	1	a	Pretty easy
9590	1	a	The best multiplayer-shooter in years. Fast-paced, skill-based, innovative sci-fi action at its best!
9592	1	a	Fun and exhilarating. A must play for everyone.
9594	1	a	Really good game, with really good optimisation so you wont lag, and i would recommend it to anyone
9596	1	a	[8/10]  This is a game where you slide. Everywhere. Very Fast. And shoot other people sliding very fast. If you lag, you won't have any fun, but if your computer can run it, you'll have a great time.
9598	1	a	One of the best f2p Fast-Paced FPS out there.
9600	1	a	it leik jet boat butr weith rocket shioes
9602	1	a	Honestly the best free to play game I have ever played. I have yet to find another free to play game to come close to this and it's even better then some paid games i've played.
9604	1	a	Tribes: Ascend injected hope into the scene of multiplayer action games. The learning curve is perhaps steep, but the efficient use of players' skill and heavy reliance on large-scale (and often seemingly miraculous) physics interactions makes the game unique and extremely satisfying. If you've not played a Tribes game in your life, make it a goal to try Tribes: Ascend.
9606	1	a	Tribes: Ascend is a realy cool game with great graphics amazing gameplay and of course bad-♥♥♥ jetpacks.Unfortunately this game does not have many players but now hi rez is reviving this game by updating it almost constantly and i hope that this can make more players will come back for this game as it is realy good.If you think about downloading it do it its the most fun you are going to have espacially with friends and all of that comes with no cost at all plus all the weapons and some of the skins for the soldiers are absolutely free so you have nothing to lose just try the game and i assure you that you wont regret it
9608	1	a	Easily one of the best shooters ive ever played, thanks to a few friends who introduced me to it. Multiplayer is awesome, community isnt too bad, just really sad that the dev dropped such a great game. :'(''' rip tribes.
9610	1	a	gone before its time. :'^(
9612	1	a	I hear the developer is going to revive this game soon
9614	1	a	Incredibly fun, and with the new update it revamps the class system to be more like the previous entries in the series, doing away with the class system and instead adding customizable loadouts you can change up with each of the three armor types, Heavy, Medium, and Light. Nothing feels better than a Tribes game, the mechanics really have not been replicated by any of other series i can think of and it stays unique to this day. Skiing and the twitch combat coupled with the massive enviroments makes for just a really ♥♥♥♥ing good time in terms of gameplay.
9616	1	a	good but requiers skill and some balanceing
9618	1	a	for people who wanna play 1 match for a long time, and who like distant fps's this is 1 u wuld like to try :)
9620	1	a	While, this game has been abandonded by Hi Rez, I do have to say that it's one of my favorite games that I play all the time. I won't give up just because others have. Just give it a chance! :)  -- P.S. I had to download it outside of steam due to some issues with the new launcher.
9622	1	a	Fast paced action, great game!
9624	1	a	Aswome fast paced shooter. It's like Unreal Tournament and Halo had a beautiful baby!
9626	1	a	Pros: Fast paced gameplay The Free to play aspect is not overbearing Map design  Cons: Free to play elements exist Some of the weapons really suck Not many people playing this game anymore
9628	1	a	The game is very unique, i've never played a game like. While i dont have alot of hours in on it my other account has much more, this game is worth learning to play the mechanics are cool to me and the classes are really different from the others. I reccomend this game to those that have played quake and team fortress 2 if you play team fortess 2 there is a sort of rocket jumping in this game with the pathfinder.
9630	1	a	Amazing game!!! It definitely isn't easy and it does require skill, with game play being extremely fast and exhilarating, battles can be the best you've ever had, and also frustrating. Trust me, getting hit by the disk mid-air 1 sec from a flag cap will make you want to toss your PC through a window :/
9632	1	a	It's literaly the fastest FPS game i've ever played, very cleverly designed, but might be alot for some peoples computers, so recomened if you have a fast computer, not recomened if you have a slow one.
9634	1	a	I love this game
9636	1	a	Play this if you have mad FPS aimbot-like skills.
9638	1	a	This is a game of motion, where every strategy employs a method of movement. And what movement it is: sliding down hills, soaring with a jetpack, strafing over the landscape. It is easy to enjoy, yet rewards skill. The pace is as fast or slow as you choose to play it, with weapons for the ponderous and nimble.   Furthermore it is free, and the graphics are lovely. The balance is well struck, and you can easily earn new classes to play that expand choice via specialization rather than simply increasing power. I love it.
9640	1	a	Excellent CTF game with increcible speed :).
9642	1	a	This is a fun, fast paced FPS. Check it out!
9644	1	a	for people who wanna play 1 match for a long time, and who like distant fps's this is 1 u wuld like to try :)
9646	1	a	10/10
9648	1	a	While, this game has been abandonded by Hi Rez, I do have to say that it's one of my favorite games that I play all the time. I won't give up just because others have. Just give it a chance! :)  -- P.S. I had to download it outside of steam due to some issues with the new launcher.
9650	1	a	This game is amazing. There is no other game like it. Unfortunatley though the amount of people playing is decreasing.
9652	1	a	this game is pretty sick for a free game, plenty of skillshots, addictive, fast paced, easy to play, and just fun 
9654	1	a	This game... - Fast, intense &amp; very competitive. I love it.
9656	1	a	If you played Tribes or Tribes 2 you will love this game. If you haven't played those you will still love it just remember the motto 'I wanna go fast'
9658	1	a	A nyc game to test your skils!!!!
9660	1	a	Fast paced action FPS that's all about speed. Playing without game of the year feels more rewarding, great job Hi-Rez.
9662	1	a	Yeah its an good game simply like TF2 but not the same graphics and even more EVEN driving 3 kinds of vehicles or Capture the flar or team death much to much kinds of games and there is jetpacks and skiing :P so its the best game i ever had   Tip : download it now its free :D
9664	1	a	Either you're slow, or you're pay to win.
9666	1	a	Play this game. NAO.
9668	1	a	Best game! If you like TF2, CoD 2 and 4 and Quake and/or any quick play shooters, this is a game for you. As much as it is getting the 'bad' reviews its a greate game becouse of its fighting stile, 'skiing' and afterall just haveing fun with friends. Go pick it up now and if you rage before you are lvl 11 then you should play it still... If you still rage after lvl 11 (couse that is the breake point of when you can get most of the calsses, guns, stuff, skill) then yea, its not a game for you, or you are still really bad at it!!!  ITS FREEEEEEE... Not a lot of free games are awesome :/...This one along with TF2 and some others make an exception!!!
9670	1	a	even Hi Rez ditched it its still a damn good free to play game.
9672	1	a	Just like the good old days playing on the PS2. If you've played Tribes Aerial Assault and loved it then this is the game for you!
9674	1	a	Ascend got screwed over by HiRez, but it is still a fun game. I hope the community can fill in where the developer failed. 8.5/10, with points lost for a bad matchmaking system, high master server pings for no reason, poor optimization, and a bad developer that ignores the community.
9676	1	a	It's pretty good after you unlock your first two classes, but before that (and even after), the game is extremely hard to master, as everyone else has super upgraded weapons, perks and other stuff. Vehicles can be acquired by spending 'XP' earned in matches (XP resets every match). This game is good enough that I still play it, but IMO, the match-making should be better. I keep being set into games that have people that are 20 or something ranks ahead of me.  Good points:  -JETPACKS!  -Unique Ski mechanic that lets you fly through the map barely touching the ground.  -Great inertia/velocity physics  -Requires skill  -Recent update made things cheaper  -Interesting weapons  Bad points:  -Dwindling population  -Terrible, if any, matchmaking  -Requires skill  -Things are still pricy  -Lack of support from the devs (they've moved on).  Misc. points:  -There are almost no hitscan weapons, meaning you have to lead your shots and use your brain to calculate/anticipate/predict where your enemy will be by the time your shot reaches them.  -No ADS. It's either zoom or hipfire, much like Halo.  -If you don't ski and/or use your jetpack, and play this like CoD or Battlefield, you're gonna be dead quick.  -The maps are large, so you'll need to use your enhanced movement to get around quicker.  tl:dr: Much better than Smite, although the developer has abandoned the game.
9678	1	a	Best game to go fast in 10/10
9680	1	a	Very nice game, requires dedication to get really good in though.
9682	1	a	It's just like Halo... But it's free! :D
9684	1	a	Ok. I haven't played this in a long time but this is my idea of it.  Take Battlefield 2042 + Quake multiply by Halo + F2P + GOTY = Tribes Ascend. A fast paced that I think takes out Nexuiz right out of the GOTY edition. Tribes GOTY edition is a really good deal. Think about it. spend hundreds of dollars buying one by one or get the game and GOTY Edition and win. Tribes like TF2 but more fast paced and NO VOICE CHAT = NO SCREAMING KIDS! :D
9686	1	a	Excellent CTF game with increcible speed :).
9688	1	a	Tribes Ascend tries to revive and renew the long history of tribes games. However the game is quite dumped down and does not really deliver. Tribes was always a ver niche game and got its experience from mechanics that are not really compatible with the broad mass of players (it was no game you could pick up easily). By triing to make it mass compatible it is loosing much of its appeal and uniqueness.  However , after abandoning the game for 2 years, HighRez is making an effort to renew the game. Lets see how long it will last and whether they can make it tribes again.  Recommended because of hope dies last.
9690	1	a	Wonderful fast paced FPS, eagerly waiting for a new addition to the franchise.
9692	1	a	The best F2P Ever...
9694	1	a	A great game full of action and fast paced gameplay but best of JETPACKS! There are so many fun game modes that you can play with and many different loadouts and classes to choose from. Most people I've seen review this game say it is a pay to win game but it seems like you can get almost anything the paid players have if you just put enough time and effort into the game, the only thing you can't get is the custom skins and voices.
9696	1	a	Great Huge Teams FPS .... and free to play ! Try it !
9698	1	a	Fast, skillfull, easy to master. Awesome
9700	1	a	First thing that came to mind was Unreal and Quake. Ultra fast-paced gameplay and pin-point accuracy makes it really good for the fps fanatics.
9702	1	a	hey guys i played this game since the clasic versions and i gotta say it was the best fps game on my old as computer
9704	1	a	Play this game. NAO.

9710	1	a	even Hi Rez ditched it its still a damn good free to play game.
9712	1	a	You can go fast.
9714	1	a	I have like 5 minutes on record.
9716	1	a	Wonderful fast paced FPS, eagerly waiting for a new addition to the franchise.

9720	1	a	The best F2P Ever...
9722	1	a	its an awesome first person shooter, has great graphic and runs smoothly, i would recommend to anyone that likes first person shooters.

9728	1	a	Awesome game! Everything's perfect, especially the flying and skiing :) I REALLY like this game. Awesome graphics, cool gameplay, cool weapons, nice maps and JETPACKS in one game. Incredible.
9730	1	a	this is an okay game it bare many simmalrites than normal fps's but dont judge a book by it's cover play it and you will understand why.
9732	1	a	it's ok
9734	1	a	great game, fast gameplay and exiting, when theres players 
9736	1	a	Just for the record, I have played this before I made my steam profile and I invested ~100 hours into it back then.  Tribes: Ascend is very enjoyable game. Dinamic gameplay and loads of adrenaline make this game truly live up to its title; the fastest FPS in the world. Maps are well made and offer many tactical advantages (and disatvantages) as well as very intresting features which make them 'alive'. While playing, you can really feel like you are engaged in entire planet-wide conflict. There are 9 classes in game, 3 light classes, 3 medium classes and 3 heavy classes which have their own way of playing. If you are more agile type of player, you will certanly enjoy navigating rough terrain in the role of pathfinder light class (as well as snatching enemy flag right in front of their noses!). If you seek well rounded and generaly easy to play class, the soldier medium class is for you. Or if you had tough day at work or are just angry about something, you will enjoy tearing enemy base to bits in the role of juggernaut heavy class. Gameplay is, as stated before, dinamic and it is skill based. You don't just shoot like a maniac, you need to predict where your target will be to score a hit. You will always need to keep in mind your energy level and your speed - slow soldier is a dead soldier. Game is not a pay 2 win in any case, you can buy some things for real money but they are cosmetic (skins, voices).  However, Tribes: Ascend has its sad and dark side. Player base is getting smaller each day, last update was released 3 years ago beacuse the devs are (for some reason unknown) decided to abandon the game. Once ambitious, glorious game has been thrown into state of decay.  All in all, the game offers a lot, its not a mindless shooter or ultra-super-skilled-players-only game, in terms of action, fun, and tactical possibilities, there is no other game that can match Tribes:Ascend.
9738	1	a	Wonderful fast paced FPS, eagerly waiting for a new addition to the franchise.
9740	1	a	The best F2P Ever...
9742	1	a	as a good friend of mine once said, 'gotta go fast'
9744	1	a	I was a huge Tribes II fan and this game works for me! Long live Tribes! Few things in the world of gaming can be compared to the rush you get from making a really difficult shot. The game is easy and fun to get into, but the possibility of improving your skill seems to go on forever. I am very pleased that this game is being supported again and is now on steam.
9746	1	a	A great game full of action and fast paced gameplay but best of JETPACKS! There are so many fun game modes that you can play with and many different loadouts and classes to choose from. Most people I've seen review this game say it is a pay to win game but it seems like you can get almost anything the paid players have if you just put enough time and effort into the game, the only thing you can't get is the custom skins and voices.
9748	1	a	Fun and exhilarating. A must play for everyone.
9750	1	a	Legendary Quake-alike action shooter with great movement freedom. Ski like a wind with speed over 200 m/h or fly up the sky with your jetpack. And in the same time make your enemy regret that they were born. A lot of futuristic weapons give you a opportunity to live through a great fight. No more easy kills. No more lame matches in which you fell asleep. Your skill is everything here. Predict your enemies moves and make him pay for betrayal. Defend bases, flags, points. Destroy enemy lines, steal their flag, kill them. You choose who you want to be. 9 different classes. All unique. All deadly. And all ready for a fight. Easy lvl-up system ensures your fast grow. A lot of psychos that will be your ally our your prey. Say goodbye to realistic and boring FPS and relax in a First Class futuristic action shooter.
9752	1	a	Really fun game, get it..
9754	1	a	cool game :^)
9756	1	a	fun and free
9758	1	a	Awesome game afterall, too bad the developers abandon it for (SMITE)
9760	1	a	Easily one of the best shooters ive ever played, thanks to a few friends who introduced me to it. Multiplayer is awesome, community isnt too bad, just really sad that the dev dropped such a great game. :'(''' rip tribes.
9762	1	a	May a great game rest in peace, press 'F' to pay respects. ); ... ... ... ...wait... what's this!? IT'S GETTING AN UPDATE!? QUICK! EVERYONE SHOWER HI-REZ WITH MONEY!
9764	1	a	Ascend is, while at points unbalanced and now near abandoned by its developers, at core still a great game worth trying out. I hope to, one day, play another game with this kind of skill ceiling again.
9766	1	a	This is literally the best fps game I've ever played, better than any of the paid ones. Imagine somthing a bit like halo, and add skiing and epically cool weapons. I was addicted to this within 30 seconds of working out the controls. It's fun, it feels good and the graphics are amazing. I thoroughly reccomend this to all.
9768	1	a	It is very fast paced and fun to run around. Shooting is great and requires anticipation and guessing of where the enemy will go. There are plenty of classes to suit what you need. It all works well.
9770	1	a	Probably the greatest F2P Shooter game ever! VGS-VGTG GOT TO GO FAST!
9772	1	a	A fun fps game but... It is very hard to shoot a enemy because you travel very fast and also it has good graphics
9774	1	a	Fantastic game. Great fun but you'll need a bit of patience before you get any good at it as it's not your usual shooter. Best of all its free!  I'd recommend buying the starter pack though as that will make things a little easier.
9776	1	a	yes yes game is good game  
9778	1	a	Legendary Quake-alike action shooter with great movement freedom. Ski like a wind with speed over 200 m/h or fly up the sky with your jetpack.

9780	1	a	Fun and exhilarating. A must play for everyone.
9782	1	a	Tribes was like a drug. Cocaine.  Don't bother downloading.... Hi-rez abandoned it. Just like every other game.     R.I.P Tribes: Ascend. 2012-2014
9784	1	a	Had alot of fun in this game, dunno if it's still worth to play.
9786	1	a	Epic fast action, you should give it a try!
9788	1	a	My favorite mulitplayer game of all time, but also the most disappointing game I've ever played. I think of what could have been, and it makes me sad. But I still play every day, and have a heck of a lot of fun, and it has been that way for over a year and a half.
9790	1	a	The best Realistic Voice Command Spam Simulator out there.
9792	1	a	Worst game on steam dont play. Wont be able to play regular games after playing this piece of crap. Jk 11/10
9794	1	a	Tribes Ascend is a brilliantly fast but not fast-paced shooter that requires accuracy over awareness. The map is extremely open and you feel really bawesome skiing and jetpacking your way extremely quickly through an enemy fort. This is really tricky to stop but also satisfying, and you don't just have your fast battles requiring accuracy. When you try to shut down the enemy generator to limit their powers, that means that you can have the normal types of battles you are used to, and you can use the slower more explode-y weapons. The vehicles some say are underwhelming, and that depends on how they are priced. There's the slow tanky beowulf, the fast motorbike, and the shrike, which is your flying vehicle that is not for everyone. The call-ins are probably better. You can make recourse drops and also call in slow but extremely powerful strikes from the air.
9796	1	a	Quick paced, fun. Only drawback is the Microcosmic, miniscule, reticule circle you have to aim with. almost non existent.
9798	1	a	Ridiculously fun to play. It's simple mechanics make it easy to learn but never stop being interesting. I highly recommend it if you're looking for something to play!
9800	1	a	Tribes: Ascend is an excellent game. Though i don't play it much, the mechanics are really good on the way you soar through the air and ski as if the floor is ice. The creative ranking system and weapon unlocks make the game more achievable as you feel the sensation of the game.  10/10 would play again. Thanks Hi - Rez
9802	1	a	This was an awesome game a few years ago, made by Hi-Rez before SMITE. They finally revamped it, and it is definitely worth reviving.
9804	1	a	Quick paced, fun. Only drawback is the Microcosmic, miniscule, reticule circle you have to aim with. almost non existent.
9806	1	a	Ridiculously fun to play. It's simple mechanics make it easy to learn but never stop being interesting. I highly recommend it if you're looking for something to play!
9808	1	a	It's a little less entertaining now, to say the least. The developers no longer support the game, the community (not all, but most) is entirely too aggressive towards one-another, and the learning curve to enjoy the game properly is too steep for the average individual to even want to try playing.  I can still say it was one hell of a lot of fun while it lasted, just not as much as it was in 2012.
9810	1	a	Tribes: Ascend is an excellent game. Though i don't play it much, the mechanics are really good on the way you soar through the air and ski as if the floor is ice. The creative ranking system and weapon unlocks make the game more achievable as you feel the sensation of the game.  10/10 would play again. Thanks Hi - Rez
9812	1	a	Best shooter since UT2k4
9814	1	a	Really good game, with really good optimisation so you wont lag, and i would recommend it to anyone
9816	1	a	One of the best fps games ever made. Support is lacking and the player base is small but it's still one of the best fps ever made.
9818	1	a	It is a good game for F2P standards but there are some major flaws.   Pros: A new take on old fps formula Good Sci fi Intelligent map design JETPACKS AND SKIING Strategic  Cons: Overpowered classes Bad Graphics (it was good at first but then I played Planetside 2 at 80 fps WOW) Unoriginal game modes  So try out the game it is fun to a certain extent. I loved the first hour of this game. Plus, this game is QUICK, VERY QUICK!
9820	1	a	Tribes Ascend is one of my all time favorite games. It may have all the evils of a FTP but it is still an excellent game. Few things can match up to the feeling of a high speed flag grab, or the satisfaction of a blue plate special. The weapons have enough variety to give everyone something to suit their playstyle, and each holds its own key to mastery. Though not as flexible as mumble or teamspeak, the in game quick-chat system works well to connect players together. The games classes are all unique and fun and give a great variety of ways to play. No class has ever been OP it has always been the weapons. From the thumper to the faze rifles to the MIRV, there has always been a weapon that HiRez has milked for cash; This is the primary source of frustration in the game. The game has strategy speed and skill requirements of any good shooter and though difficult to aproach can quickly become a favorite. I personally do not own the GOTY edition so I am not sure if it levels the playing feild or effects matches that much. Tribes Ascend: Even with its shortcomings and faults is an amazing game and I hope to see a sequel in the near future.
9822	1	a	BETTER THAN ADVANCED WARFARE!!! BOOYAH!!!  - Cyborg Torgue
9824	1	a	smazing game! nothing like the feeling of skiing and getting a mortar shot on someone flying by! it's free, so there's no excuse not to play it!!!
9826	1	a	Tribes: Ascend injected hope into the scene of multiplayer action games. The learning curve is perhaps steep, but the efficient use of players' skill and heavy reliance on large-scale (and often seemingly miraculous) physics interactions makes the game unique and extremely satisfying. If you've not played a Tribes game in your life, make it a goal to try Tribes: Ascend.
9828	1	a	 That is not dead, which may eternal lie, and with strange aeons, even ceased development shall die.
9830	1	a	Why would you shoot each other when you can fly around in planes and go 200k/h with ski things and jetpacks.
9832	1	a	It's like halo, except all the spartans are on speed with jetpacks and can ski!
9834	1	a	As long as you have the non updated version on Razer Game Booster than this will work on your computar
9836	1	a	It's a very cool game with awsome wepons and stuff. Plus it's free.
9838	1	a	While it's hard to find every little person on your screen, it is fun, but not to the point where I play it every. Single. Second.
9840	1	a	Totalbiscuit Voice Pack ✓ Jetpacks ✓ As good as T1/T2 X Play2Win ✓ Killing Sprees and Rampages? ✓  4/5

9844	1	a	Okay everyone, time to come back to Tribes! The game is fantastic and provides a fast-paced (and I mean fast), objective-based, team-oriented FPS.  The grind is still tough to unlock all the items (without spending $$$), but what you start off with is still fun to use and competitive in-game. You should spend your first few hours in the game trying to become an expert with your trusty spinfusor anyway.  New players, do the skiing tutorial if nothing else (it takes 5 minutes) just to get the basics of skiing down. It is an essential part of the game and is one of the main features that makes this game so fun and addictive.  Give it a shot if you've never played. And if you abandoned the game a while ago, it's time to come back!
9846	1	a	fast
9848	1	a	Mother of God!
9850	1	a	I have to say this is my favorite Arena FPS. It's got such unique gameplay, and it's so fast paced. Imagine having to play an old fps game such as quake, and at the same time you have to keep an eye on the topography of the map so you can ski to gain enough momentum to escape your enemies. There are so many different fun ways to play this game. I'm really glad it's getting another shot in the arm by the developers, so it will continue to live on and the community will become more lively once again.
9852	1	a	Pros: good graphics,jet pack and skiing system,very arcade shooter style, fun with friends  Cons: Op heavy (takes them like 1 sec to reload, while they also have 1500ish health), Needs better level management ( so if your lv1 and there are 10 lv 900s on the other team)  otherwise a great game
9854	1	a	This game is past its prime, due to HiRez stopping support, and a dropoff of the playerbase, but over all, its still interesting, and worth checking out. Its got an interesting mobility system, unique and interesting classes with their own unique pros and cons, and a lot of guns that just fel good to use. I'm not much of a first person shooter person myself, but if i had to describe it simply... Its like a first person arena version of warframe with a cool momentum movement system.
9856	1	a	In a time where people only play generic military shooters this is a breath of fresh air
9858	1	a	I have been playing this game for a long time and all I can say is this game is horribly fun. Though when you first start it will be hard for you to get used to the game's weapon projectiles, once you get used to it, you can have a lot of fun. Too bad Hi-Rez is working on SMITE, this game is pretty much dead, not much players playing as it used to be. If you are planning to playing this game, prepare to grind hard, and by hard I mean very hard.
9860	1	a	This game is crazy fun not alot of people play this game becasue they never update it. But i feel like if more people played the game the more updates will come. I i would really like the competitive back also if any of the people who made this game every read this i really how you start to care about more then just smite :P. This game can be awesome aslong as we give it a shot.
9862	1	a	The best game I've played.
9864	1	a	It's like Skyrim with fast movement.
9866	1	a	It takes the fun of Halo and makes it fast like Sonic. I think that says enough.
9868	1	a	Great game but the devs left this game for smite ):
9870	1	a	Un-break my heart Say you'll love me again Undo this hurt you caused When you walked out the door And walked out of my life Un-cry these tears I cried so many nights Un-break my heart
9872	1	a	i love this game!!!!!!!! 10/10 
9874	1	a	Hey, this game was awesome! Until now you're lucky to find one player...
9876	1	a	I played as the standard soldier class for days worth of hours until I finally got tired. I then switched to another class and it was like I was playing a completely different game! Not to mention the fact that it's free-to-play.  A fresh take on first person shooters, Tribes is definitely worth it. I do wish there was some form of single-player, though
9878	1	a	I love playing Tribes. It's as simple as that. It's a fun, fast paced game that I get a kick out of.... After I got a high quality graphics processor ofcourse.
9880	1	a	'bout time I played this again
9882	1	a	Game has potential seems empty. Not bad to kill some time even though I only played like 15min.lol
9884	1	a	From my first 45 minutes of gameplay:  Pros: - Fast paced - Satisfying - Manages to give epic moments - Requires skill - Easy to get into - Movement very well done and fast - Different weapons fun to use - Great maps - Hard to hit enemies, though over time becomes easier - Many vehicles - Different modes - Generally very fun  Cons: - Not a very good tutorial - My lower-spec PC can't run it that well, even though Smite runs good - May be confusing at first  Overall a great game so far, and the developers started to work on it again last month.
9886	1	a	The best game I've played.
9888	1	a	Nice fast-paced shooter! Child of Halo, Quake and Unreal Tournament! :)
9890	1	a	Think of Battlefield on every Drug you can think of. With a Cheaper price tag.
9892	1	a	Its a awesome Sci-Fi game, where it is two teams, one red and one blue. Red: Blood Eagle Blue: Diamond Sword Its alot of gamemodes and 9 classes with diffrent abilities and cool controolls. This i a balacned game and i highly recomend it 
9894	1	a	Goodnight flag, Goodnight pub, letting a 4-0 match out of the bag, Goodnight capper, whiffing past the flagstand, Goodnight d-stack, And the heavy on flag, Goodnight honourfusors, Goodnight dirty sandrakers, Good night two little brutes, And goodnight pair of jetboots, Goodnight fusion mortar spam, And goodnight unexpected grav cycle ram, Goodnight little llama, And goodnight generator discorama, Goodnight sand rake, And goodnight offence rush, Goodnight Internap, Goodnight servers made of mush, And goodnight to the Erez Goren, Whispering 'SMITE', Goodnight pubstars, Goodnight sound of fast flowing air, Goodnight tribals, everywhere.
9896	1	a	Midair shots are back and are so fun
9898	1	a	i love this game!!!!!!!! 10/10 
9900	1	a	A modern take on the ultimate high speed, high skill, far future team-based online multiplayer FPS epic that was Starsiege: Tribes. It's most equivalent to Tribes base. Skiing is there. CTF is the same mechanically. A few gripes: The advent of more conventional ballistic weaponry, not enough maps and variations in the maps that are available.   Raindance is the only legacy map. They should add more. (Stonehenge has long since been added)
9902	1	a	A shooter reminescent of older Arena shooters like Unreal Tourney or Quake, mixed with a class based shooter like TF2, Dirty Bomb, or Overwatch, all tied together with a delicious, adrenaline lined, and frenetic obsession with speed and flag capping. If you like the team oriented action of games like TF2 and Dirty Bomb, and you also like the speed of sonic the hedgehogs, and if you seriously miss older style shooters like UT or Quake, this game is a great way to scratch that itch in a time when those kinds of games are harder to find. Just be warned, the learning curve is very much there; learning to either lead a shot on a Spinfuzor or a Sniper Rifle, or learning how to Jetpack and Ski to effectively capture a flag will take a while to work out if you don't feel confident in you're own abilities. But Bottom line, this is a shooter that feels like it has the grit, backbone, and level of respect belonging to older shooters, while mixed with the technical wizardry, accessibility, and just straight-up fun of more modern shooters. Recommended!
9904	1	a	Yeah, alright.
9906	1	a	A blast in every sense of the word: one of the most replayable games I've had the pleasure of playing. The community is shrinking, though.  Best enjoyed whilst listening to fast accordion metal music.
9908	1	a	I've only played an hour and im writing , It takes more skill than CSGO Way more fun than battlefeild And free to play? 10/10 Also i can fist people and thats the best thing 11/10
9910	1	a	Joined a game for the first time to hear everyone spamming voice commands. 11/10 would spam again.
9912	1	a	The only free to play shooter worth playing.
9914	1	a	Great movement mechanics and bullet physics. Enjoy coasting along and flying through the air only to get blown away by a Juggernaught. Attempt sniping only to find people move at 50 MPH and launching exploding discs is vastly easier than shooting them in the face.
9916	1	a	THIS ♥♥♥♥ING GAME IS IN A ♥♥♥♥ED UP LEAGUE OF ITS OWN. YOU FLY THE ♥♥♥♥ AROUND THINKING, 'OH THIS ♥♥♥♥ING ♥♥♥♥ IS PRETTY COOL'. THEN YOU GET SHOT THE ♥♥♥♥ UP BY A BUNCH OF STUPID ♥♥♥♥♥ THAT JUST SIT AROUND IN THEIR BIG FAT GUY ARMOR OR THOSE LITTLE KNITS THAT BREAK THE ♥♥♥♥ING SPEED OF SOUND AS THEY SHOVE THAT BOOSTED ♥♥♥♥♥ IN THEIR ♥♥♥. IF YOU LIKE BEING A GOD FORSAKEN LITTLE GNAT AND GETTING SWATTED, THIS IS PROBABLY A GREAT WASTE OF YOUR PATHETIC LIFE.
9918	1	a	Its a really fun game i recommend this game if you like halo type games
9920	1	a	If you can ski with jetpacks and played paintball paradise, you will like this game
9922	1	a	  I havent played alot but so far so good. Maps are big, guns are good i could really go on with this for a ong time. Just one con: When you take your eyes from the screen it hurts as f**k :D
9924	1	a	This game is amaizing. I started it because a friend recommended it to me. I started playing a found a refreshing experience. It is truly the only game of it's kind. It starts off hard,but the longer you play it, the more things that seemed impossible to do become easy.
9926	1	a	The great thing about tribes: ascend isn't beating the game, it's showing everyone online that I did.
9928	1	a	Pretty good game considering how old it is.
9930	1	a	you earn very little for every match and if you are like me and likes to grind and get max equipment with effort, i think you will not like the game because the matches take a lot of time and at the end give very little points to unlock weapons and equipment. Otherwise you just like to play games just for playing them you might like this game if you are a fan of unreal tournament.
9932	1	a	Created an acc on their site so i could play, i then try and login with the exact acc name and password but it still says that i have an invalid password or username, then tried to fix this by entering my email and it pops up with this acc does not exist. After doing this i try and create another acc with the same details and it says that this acc username and email are allready in use 11/10
9934	1	a	dont know why people dont play this real fun fast paced shooter and runs well ond the shitest of pcs
9936	1	a	Still better than Call of Duty Ghosts 2: Exosuit Edition (Supply drop remastered preorder bonus DLC)
9938	1	a	First of all, let me say something, this game is BEYOND fast paced. The game has a rather unique princible of the 'Frictionless suit' Using the suit you have to keep up momentum, or be a sitting duck, it also has a rather steep learning curve in regard to constantly having to head your target and maintaining a constant grasp of where you are in the map and what you have to do, making this game a MUST TRY! The game has dazzling graphics, an intense playstyle and an active community. BE PATIENT WITH THIS GAME! This is not a game you just pick up and play, take the time to learn it! 9.5/10
9940	1	a	This is a great free to play game, its very fun and bug free. I do have a few problems.  1: VERY VERY VERY steep learning curve. The movment is very fast and all weapons have a projectile speed. You will have to master your predictions of your projectiles to get a good shot.  2: Slow progress. Leveling up is slow and hard. A game usually lasts 20 minutes to complete and usually dosent give you much experience.  3: It requires a HiRez account to play and that always takes time to get started.  But other than that I do recemend trying this. Also your starting items are very good and are mostly meta so you will not be out guned.
9942	1	a	This may be free to play, but that dosent mean its a bad game, i am sure it would have sold well as a full price title as well.  If you like FAST shooters, like Quake or the original Tribes, this is for you. If you like to have a competitive enviroment in your gaming and dont want to play something that is 'easy', give this a try, its challenging to master (not that i would ever be able to master it).  The classes are uniqe in their roles on the battlefield and all have a purpouse. The gold you can buy &amp; the ingame shop are unintrusive and it is NOT PAY TO WIN. The leveling up mechanics are overall okay, sure there is grind, but that also keeps you playing as well.  Overall its not only free but also fun to play, so give it a try =)
9944	1	a	This game is like, just, I, So like, you're going REALLY FAST and then you're all like PEW PEW with an exploding laser but you shoot it RIGHT UNDER YOU so it explodes and launches you so your go EVEN FASTER, and then you try to shoot someone, but they're also going SUPER FAST but in a different direction and you can barely see them because people go so fast they're actually measured in SANICS  unfortunately, like, 1/3 of the classes are not built purely for going fast, and it really messes with the game. Also sometimes there are flags and teams and deathmatches. Still, I highly recomend it. If you spawn a tank on top of another tank, it does a backflip, so that's pretty cool. Best game of its kind ever
9946	1	a	a cool shooter game like halo
9948	1	a	This game is a love letter to first person shooters, It is a very high skilled game but at the same time is super fun!!!! Sure it has some flaws and it is a shame the developers abandoned the game but still it has a lot of content.  It is a shame I just started to playing but it was love at first sight
9950	1	a	good fun shooter game
9952	1	a	Surprisingly good, but doesn't have a massive player base like most other shooters. The sliding and the flying make it a one of a kind game.
9954	1	a	This game is by far one of my favourites. You can move so fast and it is so skill based that even with the weapons you can buy (which you can earn in game) don't make it pay to win. It may be discouraging playing against the veterans at first, but if you keep playing you will have a hell of a lot of fun. Sadly this game was dropped by it's devs and has lost a lot of it's activity but I still think it remains a fun game and there is no reason not to try it out.
9956	1	a	Gotta go fast -sanic This game goes fast.
9958	1	a	Shazbot is a very funny and acceptable joke!
9960	1	a	Awesome game. too bad it's now a desert...on Mars.  As for my gameplay time, I playd Tribes: Ascend long before it was available on Steam. I just loged in to see how it's doing and apparently it isn't doing anything.
9962	1	a	str8 up one of the most tubular sick rad gnarly ♥♥♥ shooters ive ever played  too bad hirez kinda ditched it but they're bad to updating stuff now i think which is excellent because this game is and will always be an absolute blast to play
9964	1	a	its such a cool game
9966	1	a	'Tribes is about freedom. Skiing gives speed, jetpacks give height, spinfusors give a sense of power and skill, automatic weapons a sense of determination.'
9968	1	a	Awesome graphics and cool gameplay! Might be to fast for some people though.
9970	1	a	Red streak speeds by Soldier the Blood Hawk Too fast for the naked eye Soldier the Blood Hawk  Soldier the Blood Hawk He can really ski Soldier the Blood Hawk Moving too fast for me Soldier He's the fastest thing alive  Look out when he skies through Soldier the Blood Hawk Don't doubt what he can do Soldier the Blood Hawk  Soldier He can really ski Soldier Moving too fast for me Soldier He's the fastest thing alive He's the fastest thing alive He's the fastest thing alive
9972	1	a	I believe that tribes ascend is a wonderful game. I've tested it on an old laptop with a i5 3210m CPU with Intel HD 4000 graphics and found myself playing the game at around 30fps, with some drops to around 20fps on the odd occasion and on medium graphical settings. This shows the game has been well optimised for lower end computers and can be playable for many people who own either a high or low end PC or laptop.  I like the fast paced game movement style, really gets me tired of the normal walking speed on games like battlefield, COD and other first person shooters that are similer. I like the variety of classes and weapons and although you can pay to claim weapons at an early stage, I think that earning them gives you proudness over what you have achieved. I highly recommend this game to all that enjoy zipping around and blasting men in metal suits out of the sky above you and think that although this game has been around for a long time, it still claims a place in the best PC games out there.
9974	1	a	10/10 wouldn't launch
9976	1	a	Tribes Ascend has made a comeback with a new patch which removes the classes and once again allows you to play as you want.  Most if not all of the fillter content has been removed, which means the classes have been removed... Sorta. Instead of there being the 9 classes from before the devs have gone back to the original system that uses the three armour types as the classes, much like the older games released by Dynamix and Irrational and Hi-Rez (the devs) improved on it in just about every way.  Each armour type has their own set of weapons, grenades and packs. From the generic light, medium and heavy variants of some weapons to weapons that only that armour type can use, such as a rocket launcher for the heavy or the throwing knives for the light.  Calldowns have been removed and the item that was used as the calldown laser has been reused as the targeting laser or range finder from Tribes 2 and the deployable inventory station has been changed from a calldown to a pack-style deployable much like the older games.  The vehicle play remains pretty much un-altered but credits have been removed so they're are free, although credits are still used as part of your score in game.  In addition to the old armour system returning you can also carry up to 3 weapons as light and medium or 4 as heavy, weapons are also selected with your number keys instead of a single cycle weapon binding.  Although there are some bugs and problems with the game as a result of these major changes such as every weapon not being unlocked for every slot and loadout for each class and some of the server options no longer working because the functions related to them are no longer there.  Weapons are no longer upgradeable so when you buy a weapon their stats don't go up or down through using it and the perk system has also been removed aswell.  In short i'd say Tribes Ascend now lives up to the previous titles in the series and is well worth the download. Hopfully Hi-Rez puts this much effort into the next Tribes-esque game they release.
9978	1	a	Halo on crack. 10/10
9980	1	a	This game is by far one of my favourites. You can move so fast and it is so skill based that even with the weapons you can buy (which you can earn in game) don't make it pay to win. It may be discouraging playing against the veterans at first, but if you keep playing you will have a hell of a lot of fun. Sadly this game was dropped by it's devs and has lost a lot of it's activity but I still think it remains a fun game and there is no reason not to try it out.
9982	1	a	good fun shooter game
9984	1	a	Ive played this game for over 80 hours. loved all 80. I most certainly recomend this game. The only problem I found is it is very resource intensive. Back before I bought my GTX 760, I had a 560ti, and It got about 45FPS on High, not bad, but that was a good graphics card. Now I can max out at 60FPS because the game wont render any higher FPS than 60. Love the game. I definatly recomend it.
9986	1	a	I remember having people wipe the floor with me as i extremely slowly slid along the ground unaware of how to use the sliding system then having someone whizz by me then being blown up. There definitely need to be more FPS games like this where it doesnt rely on small maps to make it fast paced but having something unique making it really fast paced.  I played this game when its community was booming and it was difficult finding a open game. It was extremely fast paced and that is what made it so good. The class system had a effect on the pace of your experience preventing the heavy classses from going at the speeds of the smaller ones. I would highly recommend this to anyone that can find enough friends to play at once to make a game.   I really hope that there will be some sequel or re-release to get some new players or bring old ones back. Maybe adding some new features.   If anyone actually does read this review or actually looks at this games page i would be greatly surprised I really want this game to have the community it once had.
9988	1	a	Brazilian and redditor infested Pay2Win garbage   Hardly even qualifies as a videogame now
9990	1	a	its such a cool game
9992	1	a	Very cool, everything is perfect, but had a problem creating account, now everything works 
9994	1	a	Are they really coming back?

6566	0	a	A flame that burns twice as bright, burns half as long.   Tribes Ascend unofficially died within a year of its release, in large thanks to a very toxic community, but also thanks to a very dodgy developer. Some would say it was doomed from the start with the unrewarding unlock system, and its very liberal use of micro-transactions, but what really killed the game was the 'we didn't break through to a big enough market in the first year, so let's make something else' attitude from the studio.   Tribes Ascend was pushed aside, all future support and updates were suspended, with only the barest of support of some multiplayer-servers remaining to squeeze out any additional funds; And instead Hi-Rez focused all of their resources on the continued development and support of Smite - a MOBA game.  Personally, Tribes Ascend was the best shooter experience I'd ever had; It was fun, it was exciting, and it was difficult - But pulling off a flag grab and then securing a capture was among the most rewarding things I'd ever done in a competitive video game. I played quite a few hours of Tribes Ascend, starting in late 2011 to somewhere in the middle of 2013 (though most of it done outside of Steam because of client issues), and I shelled out quite a few bucks too - not because I had to, but because I wanted the developers to know this was a game worth the money.  But that didn't matter, and in the end Tribes Ascend simply went too fast for the devs.   [VGTW]   Update:  Hi-Rez has revived Tribes Ascend, and are planning on making big, big changes to the game, most of them set to change the way the game is played. Whether this turns out to be a success, or another failed project on Hi-Rez part remains to be seen. But knowing that the community on r/tribes has been given a very large voice in all of this, I remain skeptical.
6567	0	a	Awesome game,played it a lot before it was on Steam. Too bad devs abandon it to work on another game (SMITE)
6568	0	a	this was a great game. still is fun but the developers completely gave up on this game, no future updates or content. sad man =(
6569	0	a	Great potential let down by a silly business model and lack of modding and map making support. The devs do not understand how tribes is played and delivered an unbalanced mess which, being tribes, is still fun to play but has no long-term legs. If mods had been a possibilty this could have been one of the best in the series, instead it is relegated to the f2p graveyard. Expect poor server performance if you decide to try this game out and inevitable server shut-down within a couple of years. Shame.  Would have recommended this game 2 years ago but by now the Devs have dropped the game and killed the series unfortunately.
6570	0	a	Hi-Rez found out that Smite is a money-printing machine so they just let this game rot. No one plays it anymore. It's dead.   R.I.P T:A 2012-2013 Forever in our hearts.
6571	0	a	This game started out great. A lot of players,lots of fun. Hirez has since turned their back on it, and stopped weeding out the cheaters. Don't install unless you enjoy frustration. 
6572	0	a	Great game, crappy company.   Since Hi-Rez loves to abandon their games and dedicated players, I abandoned them. I'll never give them my business again. I would advise others to save their money and boycott their games. 
6573	0	a	A game with absolutely wonderful potential, a slightly less wonderful fanbase, and an absolutely horrendous dev team. Instead of balancing things, coming out with skins and new weapons was Hi-Rez's concern. And then, after saying they'll 'Look into' custom maps, dev tools for the community, and other things, what do they end up doing? Dropping the game, for the 3rd person moba 'Smite', which is beginning to suffer the same problems that Tribes: Ascend suffered in it's lifespan.   I can only hope that they don't muck up Tribes: Ascend 2.
6574	0	a	This game used to be great and it used to be really fun until Hi-Rez ruined it. They refuse to support the game any longer and it's plagued by bugs and hackers. It's too bad, Tribes: Ascend used to be my go to game when I was bored or just wanted to have some fun but now, save for a few die hard players, this game is pretty much dead.
6575	0	a	I used to play this game a lot. It even was, in fact, my favourite multiplayer. Which has sadly changed since the last update on the 8th of December 2015.   It is undeniably a very unique game &amp; most likely the fastest paced FPS in the world. What makes this game so gorgeous is not only its creativity with the gameplay, mechanics and weapons, but also a certain simplicity: There is a concept, but no campaign, no special missions. Just the good old gameplay you find in every server.  FPS are naturally repeatitive, that's not a secret, but what is crucial is its capability to keep combats versatile and allow players to shape the battle for it to never become boring and this game managed to do this oh so well.   What I truly love about this game is:    1) The quick progress. You are paid very well for your success and the awards you receive for certain actions are limitless. Just by playing for, let's say... 7-9 hours, throughout 3 days, for instance, you have already made some big progress. Some weapons might be very expensive, but everything is affordable. This is nowhere near being a Pay2Win game. And the levelling was also quite quick. You get to max out your armour, your weapons and gadgets after a few days of playing. But it always depends, it depends on how well you actually do... Good weapons don't automatically put you head-on with the pros &amp; here's my second point:   2) The importance of one's skills. No matter how many guns you have &amp; how badass youn look in your fancy skins, you don't get to kill someone who's passing by at 350km/h with a spinfusor if you don't even know what you're doing. It really takes training to be good at this game &amp; every weapon is unique and most of them, if not all, are really good in their own ways. But, of course, it also depends on the user whether it is any good. Maybe you like it firey, maybe precise, maybe heavy with a lot of lasers and light effects. And this has also something to do with:   3) The weapons simply being unique. If you have played Warframe before, or any MMO RPG, you will obviously encounter weapons that are clearly &amp; simply in every aspect objectively stronger than other 'low tier' weapons. For instance, starting of with an apprentice staff in WOW, you won't ever be able to kill the Lich King with that thing. Or starting off with the Skana in Warframe, you will, at some point, receive the broken war &amp; notice that every stat is just green and much higher when you compare it with the Skana.  Not in mother♥♥♥♥ing Tribes, because these weapons have their own strengths. It's not like in Warframe, where you just have a stronger weapon to kill stronger enemies the exact same ♥♥♥♥ing way as ever; 'Click-click-Dead' (And their powers are just fancier ways to get done with the enemies, let's be honest) In this game, you are everything that matters! Hell, you can even kill an experienced gamer with a n00b gun, if you know how to do it. Sure, some weapons deal more damage than others, but that doesn't make them objectively stronger! Some are explosives, other are rifles, some are disc shooters, some have splash damage, higher fire rates, and overall completely different projectiles and/or ways to deal damage!   This is not about the guns, the armour, the vehicles, this is about you, the player, and how well you do with what you have to choose from!   It took a lot to ruin this game for me and here's what it was:  The update introduced some really interesting new mechanics to the game. The greatest being the completely free customisation, others being rebalanced weapons, new weapons and also, a bunch of new maps were introduced.  The customisation is really exciting, actually. One gets to choose from the three armour classes and the rest is completely up to them, with some restrictions, obviously, and specification on the armour types.  Look, I don't think it's good or bad. It is some progress, yes, but personally, I preferred the old system. It just felt right to me, it gave some feeling, meaning and life tothe classes, I'd say, and a role to the player using them. Those roles were renderred completely redundant after the update, though, because everyone was unique, which is obviously not bad, of course. It is something I love about the game Angels Fall First, for instance, where the customisation is just like that, but to me, it just doesn't fit in the game. Like I said, this is completely subjective.  What is definitelly not subjective, but just straight up bad, useless, yeah even gamebreaking, is the removal of the Perks, some weapons and the levelling/upgrading system. Lordy, do I even need to comment on that?  Starting off with the guns: I understand why some guns were balanced, some clearly needed to be. The Nova Colt, especially, I guess we all can agree. I hope, however, that none were nerfed that did not deserved to be nerfed. I haven't come across one, so far. I really love that they added new ones, but maybe the blinkfusors being available for all classes makes the game a bit unbalanced. Not too sure though.  But actually removing some? I really don't see why they should. The ones that were removed seemed totally fine, at least to me. Ah yes, I remember, several class-specific guns were removed, for instance one the Raider used. Why would they remove that? The reduced freedom to choose only generalises the custom builds more. But the ones that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off the most being removed were the MKII versions of the start weapons. As you may know, every class receives a certain preset of weapons to use, until one earns enough to buy better equipment and every onne of those start weapons has a stronger version of them. Basically the exact same (mostly), but just stronger in several ways, mostly damage.  Well, those were removed and that's complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t to me. Because not only is that one thing bad enough, but also the fact that the levelling/upgrading system was removed! Renderring every weapon weak and sometimes useless. You know, you were able to upgrade your weapons by simply using them in combat and gaining experience with them, which made them stronger, but you were also able to pay to max it out. Welp, that is gone now and you might think... the most logical thing to do would be to leave them in the state they would be when they're maxed, right? Well, NOPE, cuz mother♥♥♥♥ing High-Rez nerfed'em all. You receive a weapon in the level 1 state and it stays like that forever.  Look, they level up quickly and after a few days, ♥♥♥♥ing everyone on the battlefield is using maxed out weapons. It is fair for everyone involved and the ones using low-tier weapons aren't put into that much of a disadvantage though. Even if, they could still choose to join a noob server. Nobody would complain! So in the end, the weapons are only low-tier for like 5% of their time used and will stay maxed out for the rest of your life! Probably 90% of the guns used in a battle are already maxed out and nobody is really in a disadvantage. And nobody is used to using these low-tier weapons with lower damage, smaller clips, less magazines, shorter range and sooo much more, it's ridiculous...  But the most ridiculous thing is that this also affects armour, packs and perks. The armours will stay that weak, the packs will stay as inefficient and so on...  But actually removing the perks just made everything go to ♥♥♥♥. It used to offer SO much versatility and many special passive or active abilities to enhance one's usefulness in combat! Now nobody has any special abilities anymore, everyone is weaker, no more additional energy or less mass... But do you know how ridiculous it is to run around with just one ♥♥♥♥ing mine and having to constantly resupply because of the lack of upgrades and perks? That, people, is the most ridiculous part of it all, if you ask me.  High-Rez, you broke the game. Thank you very much.
6576	0	a	Poor Tribes. It didn't deserve to die that way.
6577	0	a	I used to play this game a lot from 2013 to the end of 2015 and loved it, but I stopped, you might ask 'why did you stop?'. Well to put it in simple terms, this game was comepletely ruined when it got updated in 2015.  It was a great game back then and it had a lot of potential, but unfortunately HiRez abandoned it, which seemed like a stupid decision to the thousands on thousands of players, but it made sense too since they were losing money. What really destroyed this game was its attempt to reboot it with a supposedly 'good' update. But it was a complete flop, the update removed lots of our favourite weapons and merged all the original classes into just 3. Ever since that the game has gone downhill, I, as well as a lot of people I knew, left the game. All of this happened purely because HiRez didn't listen to player feedback, especially from the top and long-time players (I was Devilshouse - you may remember me).  But one thing that can never fail to entertain in this game is the voice chat.
6578	0	a	Before launch, this game had me really excited, even became a 'VIP' contributor (before this game hit steam +150 hours). It was tribes, but it didnt feel like tribes that much. The vast amount of automatic weapons was just mindblowing, in a bad way. It was like the devs was trying to make CoD on jetpacks. Some complained and some gave good feedback about various aspects of the game, but the devs just didn't listen. Even though the feedback was given by veteran tribes players! And now it seems like the game has been left to rot.  It feels like a good genre has been touched by something foul and tainted.  You might enjoy it, if you haven't played any other tribes games. If you have played tribes 2 or T:V, you might enjoy it for awhile, but in the end, it won't feel like tribes.
6579	0	a	Hi-Rez has to be one of the shadiest game devs out there. They have abandoned T:A to work on their MOBA money-grab, SMITE, full-time. T:A is left in a bug-filled, unbalanced state.  The Starsiege:Tribes Franchise was known for its high-skill ceiling, complex Flag-running tactics, sheer speed (thanks to jetpacks, rocket-jumping, and the 'skiing' mechanic) and high-level competitive play. Throwing the flag to a teammate while you're both mid-air, flying at high-speed along different vectors... the games were white-knuckle, high speed action.  Once custom servers get up and going, and you can enjoy it the way previous Tribes games were meant to be enjoyed, then it might be a worth-while investment of your time.  But don't give any more money to Hi-Rez. They're shady as #*$&amp;.
6580	0	a	I actually played a lot of this game when it first came out, and it looked to be going well for a while. HiRez were chipping in pot bonuses for tournaments, promoting the game on streams and such, it could have been good.  Frankly the game had and has too many flaws to write an all-encompassing review including all of its many faults, but among the highlights have to be HiRez' complete lack of common sense, vision for the final product, and inability to listen to feedback from top players, even on trivial matters (I recall a forum thread pleading for replay-support, where some HiRez employee came in to basically say 'we could do this, but we won't'), the redesigns and gross mismanagement of classes/loadouts, lack of decent balance for certain weapons, the GOTTA GO SLOW, the menu UI, the game's performance, the grind, the lies, the microtransactions, the...really, it's The Everything.  Then, years after the game had been aborted, they (I think it was like 1 rogue developer with community feedback and a lack of Jesus in his life) release a patch that is half idiocy and half comp mod, and now even the casuals who stuck with this mess for years don't wanna play the game anymore.  If you actually want a history lesson on why this game is dead,  here you go . It's a fantastic tale of incompetence.  Despite all of this. the game could be fun for new players as a f2p title, if it had players.  It doesn't.  [steamcharts.com]  For good reason. Even the very few players it has are undeserved and probably nostalgic/poor people.
6581	0	a	It really pains my heart to have to review Tribes: Ascend like this.  The core mechanics are quite solid and the skiing is undoubtedly the thing that drew me to this game the most. The maps are varied and distinct and make for some very fun team gameplay.  But with Hi-Rez's discontinuation of support and the shortage of players, it's simply not worth trying out. You won't find enough people to play with to fill a team, and being on a server with one other person just isn't any fun.  It's a shame because the skiing is definitely where Ascend becomes something of its own and not just another shooter, and it's sad to think that it will likely not appear outside of Ascend for some time.
6582	0	a	Hi-Rez installs their own root level service. Remember the expensive class action Sony lost for installing rootkits? Their shrink wrap EULA didn't save them.  Hi-Rez advises people to turn off their UAC, anti-virus and firewall. Is that advice bad enough to be held liable? It's right there on their website.  Hi-Rez installs Flash. Did you see the latest list of Flash exploits? Pretty much their entire history they've been enabling malware and exploits.  Hi-Rez and anyone else who installs malware like programs and gives malware enabling advice should be suspended from Steam until they remove the offending code. Repeat offenses should result in a ban. That's what Apple and Google do to keep their market clean.  For the record, I love Tribes 1 &amp; 2. Ascend used to be OK but had input lag even on a 4GHz machine. Unfortunately, the new patch nerfs defense so bad it turns Ascend into a bum rush &amp; spawn camping game like 99% of the other online games. The armor configuration method is also incredibly bad, resembling a Towers of Hanoi puzzle to select the items you want in the slots you want with many classic combinations blocked entirely. Many better configuration systems exist in other games going back to the 80s. All they had to do was copy one.
6583	0	a	hirez abandoned this gem for their cash cow moba but BEFORE abandoning it they ♥♥♥♥ed it all up and made it just frustrating to play
6584	0	a	The developers stopped development on this game to work on the Moba Smite. Such a dissapointment being as this game was great at one point. Lack of development such as maps and mod tools destroyed this game.
6585	0	a	HiRez left Tribes Ascend to die off to make Smite,now they released Paladins so Smite is going to die too.  RIP Tribes :steamsad:
6586	0	a	The game will always have a special place in my heart for what it offered me in 44 ranks and 767.4 hours. Sadly not a single value of those will ever go up for me.  Some may really like the changes the devs made, and others, like me, despise it because of how much flavor they removed from the game. I don't think merging guns and classes (not to mention a lot of nerfing) was the right way to bring tribes back to life.  If you're new you may like it, despite the even larger learning curve and salty community, if you're a returning vet, prepare for a slap to the face.
6587	0	a	This game used to be one of the funnest games on steam. I got in well over a thousand hours on just the non steam version. The recent OOTB patch and the lack of fun players to play with (most are speedhackers now) have nailed it in the coffin.   Rip :(  #waiting for midair 
6588	0	a	I loved this game and I started playing when the devs didnt support this game. I met some cool people and it was a lot of fun. I stopped playing when I got into to tf2 and I came back and I didn't have the same experience. I hate the new update of the 3 classes instead of 9 and being able to bring 3 primary weapons with you? I hope Hi-Rez or another company can bring this game back to the game it was and support it.
6589	0	a	  For those who played 3 years ago, it is not the same game. Everything I worked and even paid for is gone. No more classes.  I usually play as engineer or juggernaut and successfully defend my flag. Now I can't even find my favourite weapons, I guess they removed those too ?   This new 'thing' is not the same game that I invested time and money into.
6590	0	a	Best shooter ive ever played, skill cap is ridiculously high but the game is somewhat noob friendly, gameplay is so slick and elegant. Radio communication is beautiful. Graphics are beautiful and possibilities for MLG kills are endless. Did I mention that this game has ridiculous competitive value? Hell yeah it has. The problem? The company. This is the same company (Hi-Rez Studios) that made SMITE, and they totally dropped tribes. Servers are terrible, cant report cheaters, and even logging in, installing all that is a problem now. I heard that they are starting to work on tribes again tho, if they do, play this game. Till they do it, play something else.
6591	0	a	watching the devs kill this game is like those ads on tv with all the abused animals  'In the arms of the angel Fly away from here From this dark, cold hotel room And the endlessness that you fear You are pulled from the wreckage Of your silent reverie You're in the arms of the angel May you find some comfort here'  but honestly why did the devs even take the ip make a good game and throw it all away for no reason just to make a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ third person moba all we can do is hope for someone to take this ip make a new tribes game and actually support it the devs have tried to update things recently but everyone forgot about the game so at this point it dosnt even matter its like performing cpr on someone who died 2 years ago its pointless if they want to support tribes they need to make a new tribes and promise to support it until its dead
6592	0	a	BAD STUFF   I really wanted to like it. I celebrated when the out of the blue update came out. but as like most greedy companies, high rez can't live with out monitizing the crap out of their game.   Where to begin, the community is toxic as hell. most people would complain 'wassn't tribes 2 and vengance the same way' no where close as to how bad it is in this game. people slam and insult eachother other petty little things and complaints. even pointing out how stacked teams are will get you removed from a server, cause the vets have no respect for new players trying to get into the game.   speakign of stacking adn vets, the small community that remains with in the game is pretty much only one of two groups of vetern players. both of which regularly pile up on one team from what I'v watched. And pummel the other players on the other while insulting them, pretending their balls are bigger then the earth cause they are all on one team.   Weapon acqusition isnt too bad, but it plays in part with the whole 'Stacking' deal. In old tribes games, you never had to unlock weapons. you joined a server, you set up your load outs and you go. no having to acquire 12000 points to buy your shocklance, no getting 8000 points to buy your mines to put down on the flag. its what kept the community freindly, I sucked to high heaven in tribes 2, but didn't matter to me. I had every thing in the game, there wassn't any thing I had to grind for? why get angery?  In tribes ascend how ever you haved to grind out XP to buy your weapons, packs, gernades, every thing except for vehicles. a patch after the out of the blue update made it easier to grind up the XP's tog et weapons but still with the need to win to get the best ammount of XP's leads to the enviroment between plays to be very toxic and not for those who were hoping to learn from teh vets. CAuse sadly it will most likely end with you getting frustrated and the vets just laughing and pointlessly seeking you out to kill you as well as slanderize you down to the personal level point of sayying things that are considerably in the zone of harresment.  I want to see the game flourish, I really wanted to relive the glory days of tribes 2 and vengance but jsut high rez screwed it up to much, they should just stick with making MOBAS cause this tribes game is a stain on the tribes name.   GOOD STUFF   BUT... not everything about this game is bad. the mechanics for stuff liek skiing, disk jumps and such are just gorgouse and fluid. and the graphics are actually not half bad for a tribes game... if only they werent wasted.   they did bring back old favorites fromt eh series, such as the original desighn of the spin fusor (But its called the 'light spin fursor' and as the name suggest, its only for light armor), as wella s shocklance, plasma gun and relativly similar model desighn for the gernade launcher from Tribes 2. to add further to that they kept up the looks of blood eagle and diamond sword armor (if you don't know what I mean. go google what a diamond sword heavy looked like in tribes 2, then look at a diamond sword heavy in ascend)   for even more nestolgia they brought back a few maps from old games! Though when playing them youl be quick to notice... they shrunk a fair bit... (when did katabatic get so small?)      Do I recommend you play tribes ascend?   Despite they nestolgia they put back into teh game. no ...I can't bare to let the vets in that game but jerks to more people looking to relive their old days. you can play it if you really wanna try but be warned, the community is more toxic then chocolate would be to a dog. You wont hear me complain about the learning curve, all tribes games are like that. Thats what made them fun! but the whole having to unlock your gear thing is what disgraces the tribes name. made the players more hostile to people trying to get on their level. rather then just joking about and explaining how to they crazy stunts they do.
6593	0	a	Seems like a cool game. Can't play it because one of the pre-requisites required is an old version of adobe flash player, which can't be installed
6594	0	a	While it may be true Hi rez has fixed the game in recent years, this game is dead. I hate to say it, as it was one of my favourite games made by them.
6595	0	a	Fun. Until you realize the following. *Almost dead community(small) *You can never get into a match.(well you can but it takes up to 5-10 min.) *Developers abandoned it *irregular controls *you're a newb and have no good gear  LIKE SWALLOWING SAND! 10/10   It is a fun game and I hope the community tries to get the devs back on board.  *Game is now supported once again. Still can't recommend this game because of the lack of matches and players.
6596	0	a	'Well-coordinated and heavily practiced Reddit team beaten by a rag-tag group of virgins run by a furry tripfriend and a BR with 140 ping.'  The game started off as one of the best I played in 2011, but countless updates made made it p2w now though, we will never go fast again comrades, the dream is dead ;_;7
6597	0	a	Was best game once, well balanced classes and teamwork always wins no matter how many power players other team has.  But now... After long waited (2+ years) update devs screwed it all. Class system destroyed, everything else nerfed. Do not bother no more new player, this is no more Tribes Ascend. Guess I'll leave it for good after 3 years and 2000+ hrs ingame.  Damn, stupid, lame devs, finally you manage to kill this jewel!
6598	0	a	EDIT: My hours played does not match actual time played. This game was released on it's own launcher for quite some time before steam. Also note that this game officially has support of a dev team again and many changes are taking place. I haven't had time to go back and try it again, but when I do, I will change this review.  This game gives shame to the name Tribes if you have ever played the original version. Tribes: Ascend focuses on quick play snatch and capture mechanics with very limited ability to defend the flag other than chasing down the enemy constantly, which is very difficult due to the 10 second captures skilled players can do.  In the original 'Starsiege: Tribes', any player could set all the defenses with each team having a resource cap on the amount of defences that could be set. In Ascend, each class has their own defence abiliy and only 1 per player. So ASSUMING your team even sets down their defense ability, you have a very very small defense to block the enemy.  Another problem I have is Starseige used to actually make getting the flag difficult by putting them IN buildings with many turns and hallways so a player could not simply fly past it and grab it like in Ascend.  This game falls so short of actually being competitive it's just sad.
6599	0	a	Do you like going fast? THIS IS THE ♥♥♥♥ING GAME FOR YOU. Don't be a flithy sandraker, start gaming while spaming [VGS] or 'I AM THE SANICS' as you solo cap at 400+ sanics in 7 ♥♥♥♥ing seconds.  Update: I would like to edit this saying that this game is now ♥♥♥♥. The fastest speeds are now lower, its MORE P2W than at launch with new OP weapons that will get nerfed. Also dev said no more content for Tribes Ascend. Its fun while it lasted. Good night sweet prince ;_;7
6600	0	a	As much as the game has been fun, the developers no longer support and likely don't provide tech support for it anymore. Gameplaywise, it is still good, it's just the lack of Hi-Rez caring for Tribes anymore as they moved onto that junk MOBA called Smite.
6601	0	a	This was, at one point, an excellent game, one I poured a fair sum of money into, but unfortunately the developers have all but abandoned the game with many issues still left untouched, the once regular content updates that kept the game fresh are gone, and few people seem to care about it any more. Unless you really need a Tribes fix I wouldn't waste your time on it. It's a pity such a good game was destroyed by its developer.
6602	0	a	Having played this a long time after the early 2012 hype, I can say that I see why people enjoyed this game - and why they left it. Of all the F2P games out there, the system in place here feels the most abrasive. So we essentially have a fast paced and highly competitive shooter (at least, on paper) with a unique concept, but we need to 'unlock' classes and weapons? I haven't played any of the other Tribes games, but even so I felt like I was playing a game that is a mere shell of its potential - and seeing how the developer outright abandoned it for a soulless MOBA cashgrab, I don't see it ever changing. The worst part about this game is that there are some genuinely fun and well designed parts when you get past the layers of cash shops and leveling systems, much like a puppy trapped in a sewer. It's heartbreaking, and its why I can't even recommend giving it a small trial.
6603	0	a	Haiku Review  One time I went fast Then Hi-Rez capped the flag speed Only slow remains 
6604	0	a	Good example of a game that could have been something and was then swiftly abandoned by the developer.
6605	0	a	Shame what happened to the game, it became a favorite of mine for a while. Never supporting Hi-Rez again.
6606	0	a	Game loses the connection to servers all the time, good game but unplayable because it connects you for like 5mins per game and then loses the connection again, presuming that youve managed to join a game.
6607	0	a	Good luck playing it, it requires a 2000 year old version of flash player which the launcher can't install itself. Might as well just get a virtual machine to run this.
6608	0	a	HiRez screwed everyone over with the last patch they ever made that gave turrets an basically invinsible takes around 3-4 people to take it down and it's back up within seconds. ♥♥♥♥ you HiRez. Open source the game and go bankrupt please. You're gonna do it with smite when it stops giving money. The same way you did with tribes and global agenda. The only people still 'playing' are the over good veterans. Good luck playing this again...  TLDR: Was an amazing game until the devs screwed everyone and left it for dead.
6609	0	a	I currently do not recommend this game at this time for one reason, they have as of the time of this review just continued support for the game and balance is potentially all over the place, if this does not bother you however, and you are looking for an intense and high speed game, this is for you.
6610	0	a	What once was a fun game with some amusing things, like the OP perk combinations that were possible, has been dumbed down to what I would consider a low-blow to the Tribes series in general. Now that you can buy all the weapons and that in one incredibly cheap pack (which is nice, I must admit) the game feels like it's been rolled back to a beta-like stage. Should all the things that made this game very much enjoyable come back, I'll change my review.
6611	0	a	I played the beta but in those times I was with a slower computer so I couldn't play it well, but I loved it  now I got a good one and I was going to install this again, the thing is... I got dissapointed because the company abandoned the game and his players, I fell sad about it 
6612	0	a	Probably one of the greatest shooters I didn't play long for. Hi-Rez abandoned this and their first game for their cash cow smite.
6613	0	a	What was once fast is now slow, we must learn to let go.
6614	0	a	despite this rumored update, i can find no changes, and the point difference between winning and losing is atleast one thousand, for no ♥♥♥♥ing reason, 'hey did you score the second most on your team? yes? well have 300 xp, because ♥♥♥♥ YOU, GET OUT OF THIS GAME' - my experience with tribes ascend
6615	0	a	twas once a fun game but now it is dead. wish more games had sking with guns at 1000000M/s. this was one of the few shooters that took any real skill that i know of but i guess modern 'gamers' dont like games that require skill and would rather the game did everything for them.
6616	0	a	I really want to play this game. I loved Tribes back in the day and hadn't gotten the chance to play this new version until now. Unfortunately, I still can't because the game refuses to install Flash which is required to play the game. Also, WHY IS FLASH REQUIRED TO PLAY THE GAME?! Ugh, oh well. Maybe HiRez is working on stripping that component out of the game. At least I hope so. I'll try the game again whenever that happens.
6617	0	a	Sadly this game is not worth it. It was dropped by the developers and as such the playerbase is descending (pun not intended) The newest update from Hi-Rez ♥♥♥♥ED THIS GAME IN THE ♥♥♥. They updated the launcher and made the game literally unplayable. According to google and the steam forums LOADS of other people, if not all are having this problem. The launcher prevents you from even starting the game. Tribes: Ascend is a perfect example of a game that was extraordinarily good; until it was ♥♥♥♥ING ABANDONED BY THE PIECE OF ♥♥♥♥ DEVELOPERS. Don't download this game until it is patched. It is a waste of computer memory and time. If you haven't noticed i loved this game, but like life the 'gods' (aka smite (pun intended)) have killed the good in this world and leaves the bad (aka smite) to flourish and prosper.
6618	0	a	Tribes Ascend was an awesome game. I was playing it long before it made it's way onto steam but sadly Hi-Rez has decided to quit updating it in favor of Smite as I assume they figured they can make more money off that game instead. Although this game was free to play or as some say 'Pay 2 Win' I'd have to disagree with the later part as the game required a good bit of fps skill to play and someone that just bought all the equipment could still be stomped on by a more skilled player.  But with the game long out of date and less than 150 players active I'll have to sadly say I would not recommend trying it out now as you would have missed the 'glory days'
6619	0	a	♥♥♥♥ Hi-Rez.  Overpowered weapons so people would pay to win. An update broke the game for many people with no fixes. They finally reduced exp cost to a non-ludicrous amount. Competitive scene gets ♥♥♥♥ all support. They finally add a single purchase for everything but it's too little, too late.  Hi-Rez handled it so poorly, it's a shame because it's a great game. They ♥♥♥♥ me off so much. Never supporting them again.
6620	0	a	Autoguns, unlocks, grinding, useless basic maps, no iconic vehicles, autoguns. You should not add no-recoil+infinte range in a game based on skill, projectile leading and movement.  Hirez, you are officially dead to me.
6621	0	a	god i hope hirez gets cancer for killing such a great game
6622	0	a	Last time i played i couldnt even start the game.Its been 2 times already.
6623	0	a	This game was great when it was being supported. Once Hi-Rez dropped it, there was a sharp decline in game quality.
6624	0	a	Hi-Rez Studios provide a tutorial on how to ruin a game in just a few easy steps
6625	0	a	Game died a long time ago. I used to be obsessed with it but when Hi-Rez abandoned it everything went to ♥♥♥♥. Shame, it was one of the best shooters I ever played.
6626	0	a	HiRez just ♥♥♥♥ed up such a nice shooter. Now its a ♥♥♥♥ without soul. Many of players wich used to play T:A since beta are now searching for the new game.
6627	0	a	I wanted to play this game really badly, but this is the fifth reinstall of the game and frankly I'm just sick of it. I've tried proxies, VPNs, everything to make this damned launcher work. It refuses to download any updates and so on. I'm stuck unable to play it.  F*** it! I'm out!
6628	0	a	This used to be one of my favorite shooters, and now you guys Fu*ked it up big time.  Great job taking away classes. Who was the Dumbas*s that thought that was a good idea?   Sounds like a couple o' bababooeys took over the development team.
6629	0	a	Game devolpement is dead, and the game still has the notorious bug of thinking it was installed in the default drictory from over 2 years ago. The least the company could do was modify to steam version to be hassle free, i mean, it only takes a single 10 minutes if they know what they were doing rather than every person with steam spending 30 min+ googling for answers
6630	0	a	In the beginning (2012) there was hype for whatever reason.  Tribes: Ascend was DOA out of beta.  It had been slowed down, perks were never considered for balance issues, weapons were released (practically weekly) too often and without any sense of incorporation in to the already existing product and were altered from being overpowered to useless in their short lifespans.  Then 2015 'Out of the Blue', which is more like 'Out of the Beta' since the game is now truly 'out of beta' considering that the 'OOTB patch' is the 'Definitive Incarnation' of Tribes: Ascend.  The games speeds were sped up across the board... In the sense that everyone can go fast, even heavies.  Now everyone has the broken perk 'Survivalist' so you can play Quake style TDM 'camp the healthkits' in every game mode and there's a large chunk of players who firmly believe that the game being slowed down like this is just the single most eSports thing to happen to T:A.  Also with 'Survivalist' integration you have infinite ammo management added to your list of things to do as a player which is supposedly not 'Crutch', because being able to endlessly fire weapons adds a lot to online FPS games. It's not like managing resources, like ammo, and health, and energy, and shields, really adds any depth to a game.  Can't spell 'Fun' without 'irony'.
6631	0	a	This game is more or less dead by its own devices and abandoned by its developers. It had a horrible F2P model (which got changed WAY too late in its life), balancing that is anything but (automatic weapons being the biggest offender in killing player interest), 'classes' that are poorly defined to the point that they are almost indistinguishable from each other, and honestly just doesn't really offer anything that you probably haven't experienced (likely in a better form) from its prior incarnations, or other shooters for that matter (old school or *modern*)   It had potential, but this potential was never really developed.  EDIT 9/22/15: And I wouldn't hold out hope for the balance patch that is supposedly in the works that was supposed to have come out back in 2012.
6632	0	a	This is not a tactical game, it's about having the best weapon and camping at the enemys generator, I wouldnt recommend it.
6633	0	a	It is nearly impossible to launch the f#@$ing game
6634	0	a	Never found a fix for the heavy stutter
6635	0	a	This is a ♥♥♥♥ing fantastic game... Only problem is that there are so many high levels in the 1-10 servers that the people who are actually new to the game can't play. It is so much fun and such a good FPS with a great twist. The people in it though are so bad.
6636	0	a	The game is great I can't find anything opposite to say but the developers aren't working hard.If a developer sees this then I should tell you that making a good game isn't enough.. You have to support the product you make regardless of their price or their capability.. Please work a bit harder because many people can't even enter the game because of the same crash; so make an update,reassemble graphics do something so people can play and you can earn money and hear less thing about how you sit down and watch football..
6637	0	a	Re-installing for now, but worried they will drop support for this game for another two years. Thumbs down until Hi-Rez proves themselves. This was one of the most addicting shooters I have ever played in beta, and I have a lifetime of experience with shooters.
6638	0	a	In terms of my hours, I played the game since Beta before it launched on Steam. Decided to review it here finally.  Even though it's been stated before by many: A superb and unique game that's been abandoned for way too long. You could try it out and maybe get into a match, but don't expect things to be going anywhere soon and don't get your heart too invested.
6639	0	a	its ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥ unless u buy it
6640	0	a	sit on flag
6641	0	a	Best game I ever played. Sincerely.  Can't recommend though, no dev support and the servers are going down the drain. It makes me very sad.
6642	0	a	'Your account has been banned' And they never explained why.
6643	0	a	 Best free2play game out there! Honestly, this is first time in few years when I actually had fun in multiplayer fps game. Skiing, weapons, classes and maps, all of them are perfectly balanced for any playing style. GOTTA GO FAST!   Abandoned by developer Hirez Studios. Store works and servers too, but don't except any support or patches. ♥♥♥♥ Hirez.
6644	0	a	Tribes: Ascend is a good way to waste some time. It has complex and interesting maps, and while there is a steep learning curve for weapons in the game, it's far more rewarding than in other games to get a kill. Sadly, it is clearly a game developed around microtransactions, and it takes an absurd amount of time to get that one weapon you've been eyeing. Due to that fact, the majority of players have moved on from Ascend, and it's slowly fading out. While not a bad game in its own right, due to the recent lack of players and neglect from the developers, I can't recommend this game.
6645	0	a	Pollished, it would be a geat game! But as many other reviewers have pointed out, Hi-Rez Studios has stopped updating and patching it. It would probably be okay if they cut their work-force into sections, working on different games rather than just one, but they seem to want to throw their assets all at their MOBA (Which I think is sad that it's not on Steam... I actuall could use my wallet here for 'skins' and gods...)  My recomendation: If you're giving it a shot, go ahead! It's still a fun, yet frustraiting game! However, I would caution you to play a 'hat sim' or other arena shooter that is actually maintained.
6646	0	a	Holy crap this is awful. Servers are horrible, my ping would jump from the 60's to 800's. I would be doing fine chasing someone and shooting at them, and then all of a sudden I'm ahead of them shooting at a mountain, and then rubber band back to where I shot an explosive, and it would actually place me in the explosion radius of something I shot five seconds before. I'd rubber band back and forth, and even side to side, literally going in a straight line across a flat surface, and after a couple of rubber bands, find myself five to twenty feet to the left or right of my original path. I don't know how anyone can functionally play this game.
6647	0	a	This game totally sucks No more hi-rez support from me      
6648	0	a	This is not a tactical game, it's about having the best weapon and camping at the enemys generator, I wouldnt recommend it.
6649	0	a	Lot of balance issues, Some weapons are immensely more powerfull than the rest of em, Team stacking is gauranteed for every game you join.
6650	0	a	logged into the game once and now it doesnt let me login again. infact the login process is now different to wahat it whas when i first played the game.
6651	0	a	I am not even able to play the game anymore, as its launcher is so buggy and bad, that the installation is corrupted every single time. The game is amazingly fun, but Hi-Rez. Fix the freaking launcher.
6652	0	a	A game full of hakers and P2W tried it again just as shity as i remembered 1/10
6653	0	a	Tribes, while it used to be a good title, Hi-Rez dun goofed.   The moment this game started to fail, they didn't try harder, they gave up and hopped on the MOBA train just like everyone else.  It's filled with aimbotters, cheaters, and people with no life. The community isn't all that helpful or respectable either.  If you're here trying to find a fun game, turn back and play something else.
6654	0	a	Edit: Well over a year later, patch?! There's hope!  If you intend to play this game on Oceanic servers don't bother. The servers are not populated.  The game has perished.   I would like to thumbs up this game but with Hi-Rez shifting their focus to their game 'Smite'... It's doomed!  Sadness for everyone! :(  Sadzbot! :&lt;
6655	0	a	Tribes used to be good. But Hi-Rez is absolutely frickin' terrible and manages to utterly destroy everything they get their stupid hands on. After giving up on the game years ago, I come back to give it another try- and am met by an Engrish-plagued launcher that tastes like malware, and find the game has regressed back to the kind of interface and responsivity of something from the 90s. It's ♥♥♥♥.   After struggling to get my graphics settings to stick after being dumped into an 800x600 fullscreen window, I jankily get to the server browser to find an entire FOUR games with people. None of which will let me join.  Tribes is dead, Hi-Rez needs to go out of business and sell their old stuff to people who give half of a crap.
6656	0	a	I do not believe in this company or this game I would stay away
6657	0	a	DOES NOT WORK. THE PLAY BUTTON WILL NOT WORK YOU CANNOT PLAY
6658	0	a	This was a perfect recreation of tribes and tribes 2. However Hi-rez has abanaonded the game in order to chase after the table scraps of league of legends and Dota
6659	0	a	I have put more than 800+ hours in this game with my other acc, and hi Rez ♥♥♥♥ED IT Up, ♥♥♥♥ YOU HIREZ ♥♥♥♥♥ PRICKS
6660	0	a	Dear Devs, You killed this game
6661	0	a	hi-rez forgot this game ages ago. those few that actually play (and i`m not speaking about those running bots to farm up the best gear to show off/get achievement points) are so rare and a few appart, that hi-rez custommer service considers them local demigods. we have created 4 accounts at a lanparty.. 2 out of the 4 got banned within first hour because they`ve killed one player and he got upset. reason: racism. perma ban. want a good fps that`s actually supported ? keep on looking
6662	0	a	The last update broke the launcher. Now when I attempt to launch it, I am greeted with an error message that tells me the game must be launched thourgh steam even thought thats where I'm launching it from. If the game wasn't dead before, it is now.
6663	0	a	This game was good when it was still under development. However, it seems that the Developer Hi-Rez Studios has abandoned it as it was not really economically supporting the company as it didn't had a consistent number of players.  Erez Goren himself once said on Reddit that Smite brings in more $$$ for them and that's why they chose to stop development for Tribes which is very sad and disappointing especially for the Loyal Players and VIPs who've supported them for a year or more till Smite came out(and development stopped.)  Tribes: Ascend is now left in a really unstable and bug filled state(with quite a number of hackers and an Asia server shut down - Singapore i believe). Stay away from this game and do not, i repeat, do not buy the GOTY Edition if you played this game before already or not cos' there aren't many servers to play this on anyways(30-40 servers/day, many empty).  Boo to you Hi-Rez, for ruining the fun for many Tribes: Ascend players in favour of a 'money-making, cash cow' game.  Signing off, HunterSlayer 
6664	0	a	It's Tribes. If you loved the series, you'll get some mileage out of it. But for everyone else, the time has already passed.  The game mechanics are solid, and it's still very much an enjoyable shooter. If you do get into it, look for the GOTY pack on sale, as it'll give you more than enough content for your money, and is much preferred to the grind or solo purchases.  That said, HiRez dropped support for this (among their other games) to focus on Smite, their new money-maker. While I can't entirely blame them, it still sucks. And with Tribes, it shows... the servers are mostly empty (though you can usually get a few games in without much wait) and there are no more updates.  While a lot of fun at its core, due to the ended support, lack of care from HiRez about the game and grind needed to get into it... for all by the most desperate for some Tribes-y action (I think there's an original Tribes resurgence, so go look at that instead), Tribes: Ascend is sadly a pass.
6665	0	a	Ignore the time I've played this, the amount of hours I've put into this game is mad. Its an amazing game, with one major flaw. The Developers. Hi-Rez don't care about Tribes anymore, and probably never did. What you will find if you play this is a 'skill-based', unbalanced, massively unfair, OP auto, not rewarding of the skillful experience that will just frustrate you. It was good once, but now Tribes is at an 'okay' at best. New players and T2 fans, I would not recommend.
6666	0	a	Not awesome. banned for no reason. no reason. what the hell hi rez
6667	0	a	Nature's first green is gold, Her hardest hue to hold. Her early leaf's a flower; But only so an hour. Then leaf subsides to leaf So Eden sank to grief, So dawn goes down to day. Nothing gold can stay.
6668	0	a	this is colllllllll; to me it looks re4allllllllllyyyy cvoolllllllllll somunch 
6669	0	a	It's dead. R.I.P
6670	0	a	Might as well be pay to win.
6671	0	a	the game its self is pretty damn amazing, if you can stand the fact that the login screen keeps frigin glitching
6672	0	a	It was an amazing game back in beta. In truly was. One of the best ever right up-there in the podium with the counter-strike series.  And then the SMGs and Assault Rifles came along, cancelling all the skill-based nature of the game and turning it into another CoD-clone with jetpacks and skis.  I told the devs back then that they should ditch those or nerf them into oblivion if they didn't want to see their game die within a year.  They didn't listen, and the game died within a year.
6673	0	a	Good thing I haven't put any money into this game. Got a message that reads.    The game was not properly authenticated at launch time.     After checking for new software then, exits.  Time to uninstall and get my 4+GB of harddrive space back. I can use that for games that work.
6674	0	a	Played this game ages ago and thought I would give it a try again. Safe to say its got the same problem which caused me to quit in the first place, once you get to level 10++ you get dumped into the 'Big Boy' zones.  Here you will get your butt kicked and handed to you by people who have no life (they get so salty when you managed to kill them in some way) and have been playing this game for ages. The balence in this game is awefull to say the least.  It strikes me as very poor when you are level 11 and paired against people who are 40++. New players will enjoy this game at the start but around lvl 10 will drop off.  Some players are aslo cheap as ♥♥♥♥, by partying with a low level player then barge into the lvl 1 ~ 10 games and wreck everything including your fun.  
6675	0	a	Switching to Steam version, thought I'd drop an opinion here.  This game is fun in itself, and different from most bland shooters. You go fast, fast, fast, and you shoot high explosives. And I'm afraid that's where praise must end. HiRez doesn't give you anything noticable that you can get shortly, like in Blacklight Retribution or Spiral Knights. Instead, all upgrades are crutch weapons, things a class NEEDS to operate properly, after weeks of saving up from wins. There are severe class imbalances, such as Doombringer being useless overall and Infiltrators' capabilities of killing you instantly from their cloaks, and so on. It's something to play. It's very pay-to-win, free players mostly being cannon fodder. Until these issues are fixed, I wouldn't recommend paying a cent.  It's still fun to play on occasion, hence why I haven't deleted it yet.  Edit: As of 12/13/2013, I haven't played this game in, what, a year or so? If what I read is true, they've abandoned development and the game is still subject to some very serious balancing problems, especially in that new players simply can't compete. But really, the only reason I updated this was to change the recommendation from yes to no now that Steam has a system like that.
6676	0	a	Its an amazing game, but the developers abandoned the game for greater profitability of SMITE. Damn shame.
6677	0	a	hate it to much lag to fight
6678	0	a	i liked it, but its filled with hackers! DO NOT download this game, not even to try it.
6679	0	a	Horrible Staff support, never seen such bad support, even after spending like £30 on this they still dont care....  Dont spend any cash in this game or even dont play it...
6680	0	a	This game had so much potential. Don't play SMITE either, made by the same people, so the same thing will probably happen to it.
6681	0	a	Piece of crap..
6682	0	a	This is a great game but it simply wont run now. The game launcher had a big FIX prompt that did nothing but waste my time. I uninstalled it and now when i run it through steam it says it can't find the installation. When I open up the files and run the application a different error message comes up. Hi rez might think this is okay for a free game but i put money into this crap and now can't access it at all. This is a terrible company who gives zero craps about the fans of their game, and i'm guessing their attitude towards paying customers will bite them in the ♥♥♥ when no one plays their next game.
6683	0	a	It's not my kind of game. Too messy, too much leaning on knowing the map terrain and placement and not so much actual ability, lack of coordination means one player who knows how to slide real good and no suitable counters to it other than slow AI turrets make this a boring waste of time. I lasted one hour before I had to call it quits.
6684	0	a	So I started out loving this game, back in beta. It was fresh, it was exciting, it does things no other title on the market does, like skiing. A breath of fresh air, a new arcade shooter. But once you get past the initial fun, the flaws start showing up.  Physics are crap: it claims 'worlds fastest shooter,' but only in pure speed going in a slightly curved line. It's anything but fast-paced due to low gravity and weak jetpacks/acceleration (at full energy, you can't recover if you step off a platform and fall 3 feet). The effect is as though you're playing underwater.  Automatic weapons are dominant because of this lack of mobility: in a game that has little emphasis on cover, they're not fun or skillful, and 8/10 aren't even needed. This problem is compounded by the fact that bullet hitboxes -for some reason- are larger than 1-shot projectile hitboxes. Even after nerfs, they're still almost double the DPS of explosives and have no spread to curb them.  See comments for rest of rant.
6685	0	a	TL;DR (even tho this isn't long anyway): Tribes theoretically is a waste of time on the long term, but you should have at least tried it and seen the awesome, unique mechanics this game introduced. If you've got time to spare and feel like playing around for a couple hours, this'll do great. You might get disappointed/sad once you realise how much ♥♥♥♥ the devs did outside of gameplay.    Tribes probably wrote the saddest FPS story I've witnessed.  It's so sad, I'm not gonna make a long explanation out of it. It's a story of how the most promising and fun gameplay concepts got overshadowed by ♥♥♥♥♥♥ dev decisions, especially outside of direct gameplay.  My actual recommendation: At least try this game, if you haven't. Why? Because you should have seen it. I don't think it's an actually recommendable game on the long term, but compare this game's gameplay to a lame ♥♥♥, boring CoD or whatever (those kind of shooters where the concept clearly is 'shooting &gt; strategies'). Tribes does have a strategic part to it, but the shooting part is done in such a unique and fun way, it's ridiculous. Whenever I play a FPS that's promoted as 'fast', fun or individual and I try it, all I think is 'well, it's not Tribes'. Hardly any game has similarly entertaining and unique mechanics in it. Balance issues, a kind of p2w system, no mod support and updates that didn't add ♥♥♥♥ to the game make me not want to play this anymore, but I'll never forget the ♥♥♥♥ing sick concepts and potential this game had.
6686	0	a	its fun but is unrealyable and it takes to long to update
6687	0	a	It might be a decently fun game if it didn't crash to the desktop the second you ran it...
6688	0	a	It wasn't very fun graphics and gameplay were alot worse than i would expect them to be
6689	0	a	Very Bad Connection Issues!!!
6690	0	a	It's been a long while since I've wanted to come back to a game repeatedly like this. This is not your average FPS, it's better.  Edit: Nowadays, this is not as nice of a game. The community has gone downhill, and a lot of folks have moved on.
6691	0	a	It taste alot like Tribes 1, WOOOHOOO! Anywy, so if ultra high speed, 3D (flight) combat, with high explosives, sounds like it might be your thing, give it a shot. Also good if you like freebasing adrenaline.  UPDATE: Sadly, I eventually foud the constant re-balancing and introduction of new stuff to aquire to be tiresome. The free to play model seems to work against a game like this becoming a timeless classic like Tribes 1. While I am very happy to have gotten to play it when it first launched, and it's first year, I can't really recommend it anymore.
6692	0	a	Edit: DO NOT GET THIS GAME. As of last year, Hi-Rez has stopped all support for this game, and no longer updates nor polices it. The legitimate players have long since quit en masse, leaving only cheaters and hackers to fill the now-sparsely populated servers. I've been meaning to edit this review for a while now, but I've been putting it off for later until today. Hi-Rez has abandoned one game after another to focus on their newest cash grab (at the time of this writing, they're working on Smite).  Tribes: Ascend is the fastest FPS game in the market. Everyone is encased in highly mobile power armor that lets them fight at blazing fast speed on the ground or in the air. In this game, a character running and gunning at 100 kph (62 mph for my fellow Americans) is considered slow, and skilled characters can engage in 250+ kph (155 +mph) firefights. To further complicate things, there are very few hitscan weapons in this game, and all of the automatic weapons are projectile based. A fast-paced game with a high skill ceiling.  I recommend buying the 90-day XP booster, which is on sale for 1600 gold at the time of this writing (October 22, 2012). A VIP account (one that has paid anything) gets +50% XP. The booster doubles your XP on top of the +50%, for a total of triple XP (+200%) for 90 days and +50% XP once it wears off. You also get a bonus 1,200 XP per day that the XP booster is active, giving you even more XP to spend.  Also, on Facebook, you can get 250 gold for liking it.
6693	0	a	EDIT: The Out of the Blue patch has improved this game immensely, bringing it more in line with Tribes and Tribes 2. However, there still are some balance issues, but much more concerning is the still-dwindling player base. Hi Rez has shown they've not completely forgotten about the game, but now they need to show they're commited to actually making it a good one. Check out all the new changes, and keep an eye on the game. Hopefully things continue to improve.  An interesting title that's more a mixed bag than anything. Flashy graphics and unique mechanics provide lots of fun, but the massive xp costs for the countless amount of unlocks turns what would be a solid FPS into a frustrating grind fest. Not to mention, the learning curve is extremely steep; between learning all the weapon behaviors and skiing, there's a rather large barrier of entry for a newcomer. However, the DOTA- and CS-like difficulty is compounded by the xp grind and feeling of helplessness against those who have arguably 'better' unlocks and more time with the game. Granted, mastering skiing and grinding for the unlocks will certainly keep you coming back, the former being genuinely fun and the latter having the same addictiveness for completionists.  The classic F2P microtransation system really forces you to start pumping money in to bolster your arsenal. You'll have so little if you solely unlock through grinding that you're likely to never know what you actually prefer otherwise. For those inclined to do so can use Steam Wallet funds to purchase Tribes Gold in-game. This allows you to unlock weapons, classes and perks much faster than by grinding alone.  However, putting money into this does leave a bad taste in your mouth. The game does feel like it's slowly expiring, so spending money on the myriad of arguably better and/or necessary unlocks also quickly kills the desire to play. Having dropped $20 in my 30 hours of play has left me little fulfillment. More often than not, I'll want to play, but the sense of aversion due to the xp grind and complete chaos in pubs keeps me from hitting the play button now.  Hackers are both stupidly obvious and game breaking. One will ruin a game entirely; ironically, this is usually the best way to grind xp. Furthermore, despite the potential for large and hectic matches, even the normal 12vs12 games feel sparsely populated, every player preferring to go at it lone-wolf. This frequently results in both team having one or two players with better unlocks capping uninterrupted or camping your generator. The only time it feels like people are truly working together is when it's hardcore players stomping your team.  Vehicles also don't seem to be touched at all, another disappointment considering the amazing potential they can have. The vehicle pad screams for more attention. Of the three (yes, only three - that doesn't even fill the list space!) vehicles you can purchase during a match, two are bland, expected additions that most games in this genre will have. The Grav Cycle is the best of the three, but still pales compared to other vehicles seen in FPS games in the past decade.  I find myself picking it up every so often because despite its issues I really do want to enjoy this game. As you perfect your skiing and get better at predicting shots, there is some degree of redemption afforded the game? Those one-in-a-million shots are extremely gratifying, and high-speed chases are thrilling. Unfortunately, for a game so young, it seems to be suffering from the same fate many significantly older games are: a dwindling player base and no new official content. While Tribes fans may be able to look past the flaws to play a game bearing the series name with a modern paintjob, after a certain point the enjoyment of mid-air spinfusor directs simply can't produce enough draw to boot the game again. Whether that's after 5, 50, or 500 hours is dependent on how much you like the franchise.  Sadly, Tribes: Ascend is only really recommendable to the intensely curious who won't mind the grinding and frustration or the long-time fans who'll buy the GOTY version. For a game with so much potential, it really feels the weight of its awards have crushed it. It's had its 15 minutes of fame and has ceased being profitable for the developer. Without a support team to keep it patched, hacker free, and fresh with new content, Tribes: Ascend is simply crumbling under its own weight.  I love this game but it hates me. The Tribes franchise deserved better.
6694	0	a	WTF is up with this game? #endrhetoric  Everyone runs around like crazy making gigantic Hulk-like leaps through the air, blasting like crazy. The graphics are almost non-existent. Level design? lol. Skill? lol. It's just pure silly noise.
6695	0	a	A boring 'capture the flag' game... Yawn!
6696	0	a	its get stuck at the start menu
6697	0	a	It's Michael Bay: The Game.
6698	0	a	No community. Pay for gear. Was kind of fun. cool armor design. Sad waste.
6699	0	a	Had great potential but turned into a chaotic mess made worse by rampant cheating. Devs abandoned the game so don't waste any money or time on it.
6700	0	a	Enjoyed the very little time I had in this game. Too bad I didn't play more of it back then. I don't recommend this anymore because the makers of this game (Hi-Rez Studios) just leave their MMO's after they have made a new game. They have now Smite wich is very good too!
6701	0	a	*Sigh*  This game was amazing. It was wonderful. It was, arguably, the best FPS at one time.  But Hi-Rez made Smite, and they tossed this aside like a used condom.  Servers are bad. Player base is small. There have been some very negative reddit posts made by Hi-Rez PR about the issues, and there response was basically: 'Don't like the game anymore? Go to Smite!'  So, no, don't play it. Its frustratingly laggy servers and repetitive matches are not worth playing. Its one thing if the player base is small, but disconnects and high ping do not bode well for fast movement and twitch based shooting.
6702	0	a	Bit of a juxtaposition. A good game reminicent of Tribes 2, which I sank 8-10 hours of a day off into, but with more restrictions because of the f2p model. They have a few of the Starsiege: Tribes and T2 maps in there which is good for nostalgia, however, without the ability to mod the game, you won't get the same kind of satisfaction.   The devs have stopped updaing T:A in it's entirety, so what you see is what you get and nothing more.  Damn shame Hi-Rez abandoned this game for the obvious 'flavour of the month' MOBA style game, which I'm sure they'll abandon once that cash cow's udders dry up, as this could have been something legendary like it's predecessors.  A better free to play game would be Planetside 2, which is more Tribes, than Tribes... oddly. Just make sure your hardware is up for the resource hungry engine. At least the devs at SoE don't abandon their games.  (I downvoted because there's no point investing time and money into a game that is no longer being developed, not because the game is bad. Plus, Why would you give a company more money for an IP/Idea that wasn't theirs to begin with, which they've just thrown away?)
6703	0	a	This game started off great and was great fun (before making it to Steam). By the end of its run, though, the playerbase left as the devs abandoned the game on empty promises and it was hard to even find a lobby anymore. Also, the launcher was never fixed and was always buggy for me despite being redesigned multiple times.
6704	0	a	This game is not what it used to be. I played during the Beta and I loved every minute of it. Now, it's become Pay-2-Win and I would not recommend it to anyone.
6705	0	a	i try to play it but it wont work then it says i have to download other ♥♥♥♥ to play ♥♥♥♥ that
6706	0	a	It was fun to go fast for a while, but on top of not being the shazbot and the dev's ditching for greener pastures, gonna have to describe this as 'dedgaem'.
6707	0	a	This game is not supported any more.
6708	0	a	what dose it mean about runing the file to play the game  
6709	0	a	Used to be good, devs jewed out, sucks ♥♥♥♥, pay to win, dead community. Dont bother.
6710	0	a	Does not even work right now, reinstalling and troubleshooting both achieved nothing.
6711	0	a	When this came out, it had quite a bit of promise. It looked like it would proudly carry the banner of the wonderful previous Tribes games. Sadly, it seems like the developers never put their all into it, and there simply aren't a lot of players left.
6712	0	a	It was fun in Beta and on release, but Hirez have proved time and again that they don't care about the community playing the game. Meanwhile, the microtransactions actually provide a distinct mechanical advantage. This means if you're not willing to throw money at Hirez, enjoy getting steamrolled time and again.   Don't bother wasting the bandwidth to download, unless you want a case study in missed potential. Hopefully a developer that actually gives a ♥♥♥♥ about the game will pick up the Tribes license next.
6713	0	a	♥♥♥♥ this game, Sory but I play a lot of games and I was don't want to play Tribes and Today I want to play I write my account and what? again I must making my lv and unlock class... why? I don't ♥♥♥♥ING KNOW. If you want to play this game for while it's good but If you want to do 12-18lv etc better no.

6715	0	a	RIP Tribers ascend. You were amazing while you lasted. We will miss you. :(
6716	0	a	Tribes lives on!   EDIT: 141214  With the developers sudden withdrawal from this title, the future of the franchise is fairly bleak.
6717	0	a	Abandoned in favor of Smite, see my review of that for details.
6718	0	a	No longer supported by Devs. Servers are still open, but no new content or patches coming out. Official forums have been closed.   Too bad, it was fun.
6719	0	a	This game was probably the best unique FPS game out there. I wish Valve could by this game and put it in source 2 engine for an awesome sequel (and sell hats for it like tf2 :P ). Since the devs abandonded the game, I cannot recommend it. Even though it is a great game.
6720	0	a	A pretty good FPS but the pay-to-win moniker the game has earned is unfortunately pretty accurate. I bought a Starter Pack so I could get somewhere in the game (i,e, have my starting guns not sick ♥♥♥♥) and it helped IMMENSELY since my XP gain rate went from garbage to not complete garbage.  *edit*  As of 2014 the developers have completely abandoned this game. Avoid this at all costs.
6721	0	a	2 Out of 5 stars  The maps are getting pretty borring after a few hours and the class system just seems like baaaah you start with a few classes the funny thing is those classes you start with are the 2 best classes so i see no reason to buy other classes unless you want it to be more hard to kill other players, Sniper is just useless.. i find Doomslayer and Soldier the most best classes and easy classes to get some easy kills with lol... anyhow classes are way unbalanced and it makes it borring faster besides there is not many defrent weapons to use most weapons just seems like the same and even looks the same... i spended 9.95 Eur on the VIP starter pack on Steam ((DONT DO THAT IT IS WASTE OF MONEY!))
6722	0	a	Basically a futuristic competative FPS with huge open maps and everyone on skis. Its a FTP + microtransaction driven game and playable without those. Its a fairly unique take on the genre, with a variety of classes each with their own use. The game's graphics aren't that good so it runs fine.  The problem is that the dev has basically abandoned the game in favor of their new FTP moba. There's a modest score of not-well-balanced maps and some of the classes can be frustratingly imbalanced on some maps over others depending on microtransacted equipment (which would otherwise take a fair amount of time to grind out).  Don't play it. There are plenty of other paid FPS games you could purchase and get more out of, unless you're craving something Sci-fi in your competative FPS or have an empty wallet.
6723	0	a	I do not recommend this. They've done little to improve the game over the months. The Infiltrator character is way too powerfull to have invisibility too. They're stingy with energy and lastly they claim the game is going to be sold as a retail game with those folks getting all the perks at once meaning those that have fought for months to perk up are left hanging. Don't see this game around for much longer.
6724	0	a	this is a reminder for me never to reinstall this game again no matter how tempted I feel
6725	0	a	it lags out like crap and sucks
6726	0	a	this was stupid. i made 2 accounts, put in the correct info both times, and still i was not able too play. it'd be much easier too play games if i have 1 password.
6727	0	a	Very repeditive. Very hard. And the game is overall not fun.
6728	0	a	Unplayable. Abandoned by devs. No support. Hi-Rez sux.
6729	0	a	No just no. Promise to foster the community, put all their eggs in the smite basket and left this game out to die.
6730	0	a	TOO FAST TOO HARD NOT RECOMMAND FOR BEGINNERS
6731	0	a	Has awesome ski mechanic used to cross the map, and the fortress defense aspect of the game with generators and team turrets is really cool.  However the lack of players, no more dev support, and god awful weapons made this game only OK when it had support and players. Now that it has neither its not worth playing.
6732	0	a	This game is dead. It was once a glorious pinnacle of FPS, but now the magic of skiing while dishing out blue plates and having parties in the gen room are diminished by crutches. If there are ever any custom matches that ban assault rifles, I suggest you give it a try.
6733	0	a	Was fun until an error in the system prevented me to login. Changing the password did not work, and contacting support was like pulling teeth. May just be a single occurance, but it is really annoying when you can't even play. Proceed with caution.
6734	0	a	Had great potential but turned into a chaotic mess made worse by rampant cheating. Devs abandoned the game so don't waste any money or time on it.
6735	0	a	♥♥♥♥♥
6736	0	a	Free 2 Play kill it in the most ugly way.
6737	0	a	I don't know is this game good or bad because when the launcher is opened download doesn't start. And different solutions don't help
6738	0	a	Tribes died with Dynamix.  ♥♥♥♥ you Hi-Rez. Are you making enough ♥♥♥♥ing money off of smite and the drones that play that crap?
6739	0	a	Been abandoned. Tribes has ALWAYS been amazing. Difficult but super fun and extremely satisfying when playing well. Devs gave up on it, hacks are pretty rampant. No point in playing or investing time in. Steam should remove it from the list.
6740	0	a	it is a great game, but hi-rez studios obviously doesn't care about tribes anymore, they're off to fix smite. and they still expect players to trrow coins at the game for the better weapons and stuff. hi-rez really gotta make this stuff actually free to play, or elce this game is just gonna die off
6741	0	a	Problematic install, never got into the game, seems like something EA would release (with the amount of trouble experienced)   Just ended up giving up and deleting it, which sucks, because i was excited to play it, played the original YEARS ago.
6742	0	a	It seems they put a lot of effort to jumpstart the Tribes series again, which was long dead and a favorite of mine some 15 years ago  (Tribes Vengeance and Mechwarrior: Vengeance, two games I loved dearly which received a reboot and got me to download Steam in the first place.. then ended up being f2p fodder.)  To be fair I never bought the game and did the f2p route, which i'm guessing is what a majority ended up doing.. shame, because I believe this is what killed it and hence why the developers (likely fans of the original Tribes game) nuked it as to them the public had no interest in showing support.  As for a review I can't offer much because I was only ten minutes into playing online when I decided to remove it from my system, it was incredibly laggy and not the game I used to love.
6743	0	a	Essentially a few pros one-hit killing everyone for money. Everybody flies really fast and shoots really OP weapons. Really horrible game... Oh, and did I mention the 2003 textures and tiny maps? And the frequent crashes? And low FPS?
6744	0	a	A solid fast paced FPS that is by far the best CTF game mode in any FPS ever. The speed and intense gameplay are second to none, and the game is utterly mesmerising to play at a high level. The game however has suffered from the developers decision with additions that destroyed a lot of the games balance and ruined many of the classes roles. Before then abandoning it for another IP they had also been creating (SMITE). This is a sad thing due to the potential the game had right from the start. With a solid base like it had at launch the game could have well been one of the premiere competitive FPS games out there. With a large playerbase it fundimentally was already there, but the poor balancing and choice of weapons fundimentally ruined the game and it's current state is not much fun.  I'd like it if HI-Rez actually did come back and resolved the games concurrent issues and took it foward. That or another company got the rights to the Tribes brand and developed it. I'd gladly drop more money on this game any day, if it was developed with the proper care and attention to the game itself.
6745	0	a	i cant start the game
6746	0	a	game launcher does nothing. this is what the pros call 'skiing'
6747	0	a	boring
6748	0	a	Just a waste of hard drive space. Most guns can hit anything unless you are standing still which will get you killed. Horrible default controls and the 'skiing' thing which is suppposed to be fun...isn't.
6749	0	a	It was a fun game but then it was destroyed by the developers. The weapons are unbalanced and the game is abandoned, so there is no chance that it's going to be fixed. Nor are there going to be any new maps or game mods. For shame, Hi-Rez, for shame.
6750	0	a	So downloaded the game, sweet all good from there. Then started the game and changed graphics setting to high as possible, started the tutorial, played till the part you get to the second slope, got kick and banned for tutorial. Not worth your time
6751	0	a	F2P, class-based, high-speed, Capture The Flag. The main mechanic is being able to turn off friction with a press of a button, meaning you can gain incredible speed off of hills, grabbing the flag at 300+ and being a mile away in 5 seconds. It's made in Unreal so it looks ♥♥♥♥ing boss, and because most weapons have a portion of your momentum imparted on their projectiles, this is the definition of a skillful shooter  why don't I recommend it? the community is dead. GG Hirez
6752	0	a	Whoever shoots first wins; technician and other defensive play is completely useless thanks to overpowered weaponry destroying player and turret in one shot; ammo is incredibly scarce without returning to predictable and thus campable locations; ludicrous speed and physics of game and lack of teamwork in player base renders success based on sheer luck of the draw. Like any other FPS, full of wouldbe macho boys. Complete waste of time, skip it.
6753	0	a	it will not work no matter what i do
6754	0	a	got banned from hackusations. i wanted to play this game so bad but now i cant. and wont be able to.
6755	0	a	devs killed it a long time ago with hitscan weapons, where's the skill
6756	0	a	Does not always launch.
6757	0	a	I would rather play the old tribes than this piece of ♥♥♥♥. nothing like super onesided matches YAAAY you let me down high rez and ruined one of my favorite games.
6758	0	a	Any reason this game is still on Steam? It updates but won't let me play. LAMESAUCE. I enjoyed it for what it was, too bad you can't play it anymore. Steam should take this down, as the game is just a brick, updates and won't let you click play. Good job.
6759	0	a	So, the game looks good and it can be fun to zip around the landscape trying to line up the perfect shot to blow your opponents to bits, but there are just so many things that get in the way of enjoying the game. Some classes feel poorly balanced, the sniper class does less damage than most of the heavy classes, meaning your reward for lining up incredibly difficult shots is almost nonexistant. The 'technician' class seems like it is designed for defends generators and whatnot, but his default weapons are poory suited to dealing with heay/medium armor classes that would attack a generator. It's amost always a good idea to just choose a heavy class, because you live longer and deal the most damage. Supposedly it's balanced through lesser mobility, but that often doesn't matter in the 8 person meelee to pick up a flag or defend an objective.
6760	0	a	Me and Tribes have a love-hate relationship I loved this game when it came out but now... The people who buy weapons and other stuff with real world money have a clear advantage over the low level guys who only have the default weapons. I also don't like the matchmaking system... up untill level 7 you can still play against low level guys like you, but when you reach level 8 you play against all of the other players that are really skilled and know the maps really well.  If you don't like pay to win games don't download this game, but if you can live with all of the pay 2 win players you will really enjoy this great game.   P.S. I played Tribes mostly from their website and only a little bit on steam.
6761	0	a	I played this game with my friends for probably 100 hours in early beta, later I came back and played for about 30 and when I came back even later I realized that they mucked it up pretty bad. It became very unbalanced and the microtransactions were stronger than ever. I woul have recommended this game time and time over in the old verons but now I can only say to avoid it as it has been dropped by hi-rez studios.
6762	0	a	This game is amazing and is awesome, but the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ dev team refuses to understand that people still play this game. There is at least one hacker on every server you join, and a bunch of dumb asses who stick up for them. This game is ruined, and it's because of the devolpers incompetence, and laziness. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ You D U M B S H I T hacking A S S H O L E S and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ YOU Developers for ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ I N G Up such a great game.
6763	0	a	No more updates, why? to make more smite related things because MOBA is the new black and they desperetely want money There's always a freaking 'Hi-Rez Patch Service' that you have to disable to not be monitored by this amazing Hi-Rez, it's supposed to be some sort of anticheat that searches in your RAM to find hacks and stuff like that (although I've seen cheaters anyway...), this process starts along with windows and cannot be killed, you have to disable the service so they stop searching in your computer, also this service does not uninstall after uninstalling Tribes Ascend.  The game is a pretty good idea but sucks at balance. Being called 'the fastest fps', that's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, everyone's a freaking juggernaut wich is a tanky class with low mobility, tons of damage and giant blast radius (yes, it's also a tank, makes a lot of sense, right?), I actually tried this class to see if there was some skill involved and I admit the low mobility is quite a problem but with the high damage and blast radius... pfft, I fired several shots randomly at the air and managed to kill people without even knowing they were there. The fastest class can be easily killed with one shot by mid armored classes and it's not really that hard to do (the heavy armored classes blow on it and it just blows up).   I used to play this game before it came available on Steam, slowly realising how bad it was, pretty good ideas, good mechanichs and at least I had no glitches but the community sucks with people camping in base, juggers spamming giant bombs on little spaces with infinite ammo (since supplies are too close to generators) and some cheaters that can't be kicked or reported (so that 'Hi-Rez Patch' or whatever is completely useless and no, you can't play without it)
6764	0	a	the game is realy fun its just there hardly any people playing it
6765	0	a	every tiME I PRESS BOOM SAY PROBLEM 
6766	0	a	This use to be a really fun game but now it's full of hackers so it's pointless playing it. Funny that the hackers are always very rude and act like they are the best yet they snipe you with a shotgun and launch you out of the map with their hacks.  It's very obvious type of hacks that these people use and they have no care in the world for the game, they just want to  ruin it and cause griefing. So much fun. =/  Don't bother wasting your time installing this game, you will just be dissapointed and really ticked off for evening messing with it.  If they went back and fixed everything and got rid of the hackers, then I would say to download this game and play it asap. Also, I would be returning back to it.
6767	0	a	i got mad at this game 10/10 will not play again
6768	0	a	I used to play this gem a couple of years ago. Such a shame the devs publicly abandoned it.

R.I.P Tribes Ascend.
6770	0	a	Games dying quickly, at any given time there's 9-10 servers ACROSS THE WORLD with a playable amount of people. And most of those are 'novice' servers, which means people above level 8 can't join at all. The game has major balance issue on top of that, and nothing will ever be fixed or added because MOBA's are the latest trend.
6771	0	a	This game used to be about going fast and having fun, but once I realized that the most expensive unlocks unbalanced the hell out of the game, I dropped it. This is the definition of pay2win, which is giving those who pay money a SIGNIFICANT advantage over those who don't. Of course you could grind hundreds of battles to get those items, but at some point in time the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ devs decided to put in a speed cap. So now scouts were useless, and anyone could catch the guy with the flag, when the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game was based around going faster than the other guy. ♥♥♥♥ you Hi-Rez.
6772	0	a	ITs taking forever to connect to connect to a server. kept it connecting all night and ultimately it lost its connection I have to face this ♥♥♥♥ even after solving the 'waiting for verification problem'

6780	0	a	Not worth the time. I played since early beta and this game has always been underwhelming to the genre and an insult to the franchise. Bland combat, too many automatic weapons, small bland maps, AoE orbital super attacks, vehicles require ingame credits, blatant OP weapons, ignored broken mechanics, out of place 'class' system., and now complete developer abandonment.  They didn't have to copy Tribes 2 word for word, but they probably shouldn't have built it with nothing but broader appeal, and over simplification. This game failed for the same reasons Tribes: vengeance failed. The developer completely forgot what made Tribes 1 and 2 popular. Instead they tried to steal scraps from the tables of other games.
6781	0	a	This game use to be great until they abandoned it to work on smite. I want to play it now but I cant even get it to the main screen without crashing or running into an error

6793	0	a	It was a great game when regular updates were coming out and they actually cared. I spent the $40 or w/e for this game and now this game barely has a fanbase anymore. Hi-rez is all about the money, nothing else. I'd suggest not getting it. Excellent game, subpar people.
6794	0	a	i have played all the previous tribes games. and this one (by far) is the most simplistic and dumbed down version. There is almost no stategy or teamwork left in the series. it is all about aiming and shooting, and there are hundreds of more interesting games that have the same depth. yes there are jetpacks, skiing and slow projectile weapons, but none of benefits of mastering them, because the only way victory is just who is better at aiming. no teamwork, no strategy, and no depth.   google 'tribes 2 trailer' for a small and simplistic example of the strategy that used to be required. even from over a decade ago with sucky graphics, the gameplay exceeded tribes ascend by far.
6795	0	a	Tribes: Ascend is a game with incredible potential, with a genius concept great weapons, and good balance. It could change the way FPS's are made. But unfortionatley it is pay to win. In order to get all the good stuff, you need to pay. And if you don't want to pay, it takes an incredibly long time to get enough XP to get the good stuff. It even takes a while to unlock all the classes. Starts out good, but after a while you realize it's more frustrating than fun.
6796	0	a	tribes is dead... hasnt been a proper tribes since T2. although this was a better attempt then T:Vengence, i kept all the same problems.  maybe someday someone will just port T2 to a better engine and stop trying to reinvent the wheel.  aint broke dont fix it.

6815	0	a	When this came out, it had quite a bit of promise. It looked like it would proudly carry the banner of the wonderful previous Tribes games. Sadly, it seems like the developers never put their all into it, and there simply aren't a lot of players left.
6816	0	a	It was fun in Beta and on release, but Hirez have proved time and again that they don't care about the community playing the game.

Don't bother wasting the bandwidth to download, unless you want a case study in missed potential. Hopefully a developer that actually gives a ♥♥♥♥ about the game will pick up the Tribes license next.

6825	0	a	Ruined the Starsiege Lore. Retconned to heck. &lt;Giver-of-Will&gt; is disapoint.
6826	0	a	I Really hate to see games that have so much potential and fall flat on its face. Don't get me wrong, I like the idea for this game, I really do. And for a while that game worked and had a big following, But Hi-Rez have completely ruined there own game in this case. First of all, the graphics feel like last gen graphics (Even on max settings) which isn't good seeing as how the game is only a year old, next you have bad texture pop in, lag and environmental glitches. All of which could have easily been fixed with patches and routine updates, but Hi-Rez have stopped updates for this game to focus on SMITE (Ironically, its suffering the same fate as Tribes: Ascend). But if you're willing to look past the bad graphics (Gameplay over Graphics) the game does work, skiing, vehicles, jetpacks etc. work like they are supposed to, however trying to get accustomed to using them well in a game is impossible, because the community of new players is dead, leaving only Tribes veterans, that will wipe the floor with you giving you virtually no chance to improve at your own pace. and to make matters worse, the training section is a joke, they have a few options, basic skiing, free roam, practice with bots (F.Y.I. the training with bots isn't a full match like you'd think, its just the bots running back and forth in set direction or not moving around at all) or watching youtube videos explaining the classes. To me that is just lazy. And even thought they have servers of novices only, nothing stops a level 32 veteran from connecting to the server and demolishing all the level 1-7 novices; once again stopping all progress to get better at your own pace. All in all, don't get this game, it was great at one point but unfortunately we are all a year too late from it heyday. the only way I could recommend this game is if you're a tribes veteran, which most of us are not
6827	0	a	Game no longer balanced. Dont even bother playing at this point, everyone has the exact same guns, and same loadouts. only 3 'classes' (which by the way, can access the exact same armors and guns no matter which you are) now instead of 9.  as of september of 2016, peak players are around 70 in the last 30 days. its official folks, they killed the game (avg of 40 players on a day)
6828	0	a	Fun, Until you get banned for no reason.
6829	0	a	This game is not what it used to be. I played during the Beta and I loved every minute of it. Now, it's become Pay-2-Win and I would not recommend it to anyone.
6830	0	a	i try to play it but it wont work then it says i have to download other ♥♥♥♥ to play ♥♥♥♥ that
6831	0	a	It was fun to go fast for a while, but on top of not being the shazbot and the dev's ditching for greener pastures, gonna have to describe this as 'dedgaem'.
6832	0	a	This game is not supported any more.
6833	0	a	I really wished it went back a couple of patches. I've had A LOT of fun with the game and when it was in late beta phase I'd recommend it to everyone. But at the moment there's better fast paced shooters with more support. If you are intrigued by the skiing mechanics then go ahead and try the game out. It's free.
6834	0	a	When this came out, it had quite a bit of promise. It looked like it would proudly carry the banner of the wonderful previous Tribes games. Sadly, it seems like the developers never put their all into it, and there simply aren't a lot of players left.
6835	0	a	It was fun in Beta and on release, but Hirez have proved time and again that they don't care about the community playing the game. Meanwhile, the microtransactions actually provide a distinct mechanical advantage. This means if you're not willing to throw money at Hirez, enjoy getting steamrolled time and again.   Don't bother wasting the bandwidth to download, unless you want a case study in missed potential. Hopefully a developer that actually gives a ♥♥♥♥ about the game will pick up the Tribes license next.
6836	0	a	♥♥♥♥ this game, Sory but I play a lot of games and I was don't want to play Tribes and Today I want to play I write my account and what? again I must making my lv and unlock class... why? I don't ♥♥♥♥ING KNOW. If you want to play this game for while it's good but If you want to do 12-18lv etc better no.

6839	0	a	This game use to be great until they abandoned it to work on smite. I want to play it now but I cant even get it to the main screen without crashing or running into an error
6840	0	a	Hi-Rez ruined this game.
6841	0	a	Developer has abandoned the game and now it doesn't work at all. It's a shame, seemed like it had potential :(
6842	0	a	this game is god fps but the devs abandoned the game
6843	0	a	locked loadouts because the devs were too lazy to balance, ruined by free to play, and abandoned by dev. The only leg up it has on Tribes 2 is graphics, and that's just not worth it.
6844	0	a	Hi-Rez abandoned the game over a year ago. But if it looks interesting give it a shot, it’s sorta F2P.  
6845	0	a	This game does not understand anything it is a waste of time and space. It wont let me log in and keeps saying my player name is not allowed. Take my advice don't play it &gt;:/
6846	0	a	A LONG time ago, it was good.  read: WAS.  Hi-Rez dropped support for this game entirely to go develop Smite, and even worse, new players are unable to create a new account (as if they can't just use Steam, what genius required you to make a whole new account just to play this game) in-game, and if you happen to sign up on their website, it gives you a 'lost connection to the server' error.  Keep your HD space, don't install.
6847	0	a	As fun as the game is, the lack of getting local servers in South Africa is a major loss, with a ping over 160ms it's unplayable. We've been told that local dedicated servers are coming for about 2 years now. No care for the other parts of the world alas. It's sad because we have a large gaming community, especially for FPS games.
6848	0	a	Not really recomended at all. Very fun at first but then you realize its actually a very small community relative to many games. That community is also very good. So unless you are just very gifted at this game or plan to pump a lot of time into getting better its not worth it. There is no casual community. Bots could improve the experience a lot, as it is a fun game. Having more casual players would be good too but I couldnt say how to do that.  No matter what you do DO NOT spend money on the in game gold. After a couple dozen hours I have been able to unlock anything that I really wanted. None of the unlockables are even that good to be honest; which is a good thing to me because buying victory seems cheap.  TL;DR: Community is small and skilled and there is only PVP. Most players will prob just get farmed for exp by elites.
6849	0	a	I have a problem in the launcher. The uptade bar doesn't loading. 'Tribe Ascend is validating' or 'Checking for software updates'
6850	0	a	horrible ♥♥♥♥ing game. wont even start up. no one downlaod this game, its a waste of time
6851	0	a	Nothing really wrong with the look of the game. However the feel, for me was off. The mechanics just didn't flow smoothly for me to feel immersed enough to enjoy the game play. 
6852	0	a	a poor version of previous greatness
6853	0	a	Dead game (no longer being developed for after cash grab). Developers screwed players and the competitive community. Ruined the Tribes IP with their incompetence. DO NOT DOWNLOAD OR SUPPORT HI-REZ STUDIOS.
6854	0	a	I'll admit, I quickly became absorbed by the quick gameplay and flashy explosions. However, with the release of bigger, better first person shooters, Tribes Ascend quickly became obsolete; it is now easier to see how it completely fails in the gameplay department. Most modes are simply 'create the most, biggest explosions to win' deathmatches. Requiring general aiming skill and a twitch finger, you need merely skate around and blow up enemies with AOE-damaging weapons.
6855	0	a	A first person shooter with a very interesting mechanic which makes it very fun to play. However, the game involves an unreasonable amount of grinding to succeed and is very difficult. It's great if you have the time, but a lot of people these days don't.
6856	0	a	This game is by far the worst FPS out there. Ok, so maybe it has cool mechanics - skiing, for example - but they just arent fit for an FPS game. Sure, going super fast may be cool and all, but it makes it almost impossible to hit people without and explosive weapon. And this brings up another topic - unbalanced. This game. This game has the worst balancing ever in any game ever. EVER. Some weapons to next to nothing while some weapons instakill you. *Cough* *cough* Explosive weapons *cough* *cough*. You need to have an explosive weapon and have about 10 hours of playtime to get a single kill. Nuff' said.
6857	0	a	I used to enjoy to play Tribes but Tribes ascend is nothing like the 3 earlier ones. There is too much Rifle gunning in this game then actual tryin to do midair discs. and on top off it all, HiRez dropped the devolopment on Tribes. its shame realy that they bought the game and decided to fk it up this much, shame on you HiRez.
6858	0	a	the game is great the first month, but after getting all the guns/ classes and played on all the maps and modes you wont gonna gent anithign else and thats on the first month...  those damn devs abandoned this game too soon(13 April 2013) to support that 3rd person moba crap, screw you Hi-Rez studio.

6862	0	a	RIP Tribes. Game is dead and was only okay to begin with.
6863	0	a	I loved this game, I was a Alpha and closed beta tester for the game and had loads of fun, I have never played the other tribes but the Graphics and gameplay of this one is what attracted me to it. The game is Beautiful.  One problem with this game now is that the Developers, HI-REZ studios decided to take their focus off of this game and put it on their ♥♥♥♥ game Smite. Because of that they left this game to die off never to be touched again. Yeah they left it up for the people to mod and keep the game alive but they need to give the game up and let someone better at managing their games handle further development. Hi-Rez makes alright games but its just to bad they can only focus one game at a time.
6864	0	a	I enjoyed playing it for a while, until I grew tiresome of the unlocking of weapons and micro-transactions. I felt like Hi-Rez were the wrong people to gain access to the Tribes IP, other FPS-Z developers could have been making this game enjoyable for a longer period of time with more and more updates, but Hi-Rez gave up on this game, and moved on to a 3D-MOBA. Also, the fact that Hi-Rez haven't opened T:A for modding surprises me, since old Tribes could be modded till your heart's content. For all the Tribes players reading this review - VGCG , VGTW and VGTA.  VGS [Shazbot!] R.I.P *spams F to pay respect to Tribes IP*
6865	0	a	Tribes used to be a legit game until HiRez went full jew with p2w and abandoned the game for SMITE, RIP tribes I used to be able to go fast.
6866	0	a	This game had so much potential. Don't play SMITE either, made by the same people, so the same thing will probably happen to it.
6867	0	a	It's not my kind of game. Too messy, too much leaning on knowing the map terrain and placement and not so much actual ability, lack of coordination means one player who knows how to slide real good and no suitable counters to it other than slow AI turrets make this a boring waste of time. I lasted one hour before I had to call it quits.
6868	0	a	Its an amazing game, but the developers abandoned the game for greater profitability of SMITE. Damn shame.
6869	0	a	hate it to much lag to fight
6870	0	a	i liked it, but its filled with hackers! DO NOT download this game, not even to try it.

6872	0	a	NO ONE PLAYS THIS GAME! IT IS DEAD GO AWAY! NOTHING TO SEE HERE!
6873	0	a	The solid return of the fast paced FPS. My time with Tribes Ascends was well worth it. The community has lagged since it's release, but is still worth a try too see what an FPS was, and could still be.
6874	0	a	I waited in a queue for way to long and gave up.
6875	0	a	This is a great game but it simply wont run now. The game launcher had a big FIX prompt that did nothing but waste my time. I uninstalled it and now when i run it through steam it says it can't find the installation. When I open up the files and run the application a different error message comes up. Hi rez might think this is okay for a free game but i put money into this crap and now can't access it at all. This is a terrible company who gives zero craps about the fans of their game, and i'm guessing their attitude towards paying customers will bite them in the ♥♥♥ when no one plays their next game.
6876	0	a	I played this game before it was out on Steam and it was a blast. After leaving it for a while to play other games I was disappointed to come back and see no active servers.   After several days of checking at various times of the day I can now conclude that this game is completely dead. What a shame because the game had such good play mechanics and wonderful eye-candy.

6885	0	a	Tribes Ascend is a very fun game to play. But I made the mistake of purchasing the Game of the year edition through steam DO NOT PURCHASE IT!!! The game of the year edition allows you to have everything unlocked classes weapons etc. I wasnt able to use it no matter what I did. Not to mention the GAME OF THE YEAR edition for this game WAS 10 DOLLARS LESS ON THE HI- REZ STORE THAN STEAM!!!! Despite my mistake surrounding this game. This game reminds me of playing halo multiplayer back in the day, and I do love playing it!
6886	0	a	Like going slow? Don't bother.  Problem?  EDIT: After many hours, it turns out that Hi-Rez Studios found its other games far more profitable and interesting. It was too expensive from the get go. They never bothered to address this until the game was almost dead. Its really a shame they killed the Tribes franchise. I'll be honest, it is / was a good game. The developers were just terrible at operating it. In example, at one point to puchase a single primary weapon was 10.00 USD. That is absurd. Eventually it got lowered some, then as the game died, they made a get it all pack. Far too late, HiRez. You won't have any of my money.  They also stopped addressing gameplay issues and bugs, most of them being weapon balancing. Just look up what happened when the Plasma Rifle was introduced. It was eventually fixed, but from there on out it was a hillarious rollercoaster of balance problems.  I have to unfortunately change my review to 'Not Recommend'

6891	0	a	I know that you(the reader) want a nice quick review of this game, so here: It's a mess of bugs and unbalanced gameplay, very hard to get into and hacker were on every server i went onto. Don't even look a the GOTY version.    From,  An angry gamer...
6892	0	a	Was a really great game until the F2P stuff started really kicking in. Hi-Rez practically abandoned the entire thing to work on Smite. The worst part is that the launcher wont even work through steam. You have to download it directly from them. Don't waste your time.
6893	0	a	For anyone looking for a good Shooter Game I suggest you look some where else. The game is very hard to get the hang of and is very confusing to new players, especially if this is your first shooter game. Plus, it really doesn't make any sense, it's just chaos.
6894	0	a	During its release it was a spectacular phenomenon with exceptionally balanced combat mechanics and gameplay. Movement feels fluid as it ever has in the tribes series, and graphically it is a marvel with brilliant skyboxes, particle effects, and motion blur. A sheer joy, it was a rare game where being just a spectator was enjoyable.   But now, depressingly I might add, after tens of thousands of game hours spent Hi-Rez decided to shut down game development and with it any kind of support. Servers have been in a laggy mess ever sense and anything other than a pub match is impossible. Combat balance is long gone with all the added weapons for multiple classes creating upgrades rather than sidegrade options for those willing to purchase them.   Hi-Rez made a miserable mess of this game that had so much potential, and left the cult like following of it with barely a trace other than a slightly lighter wallet.

6912	0	a	its ok, sort of  -no sights  -no match balancing  -guns gated behind xp/gold walls  -old account was wiped after a few years (not really suprised at that really)
6913	0	a	Games dying quickly, at any given time there's 9-10 servers ACROSS THE WORLD with a playable amount of people. And most of those are 'novice' servers, which means people above level 8 can't join at all. The game has major balance issue on top of that, and nothing will ever be fixed or added because MOBA's are the latest trend.
6914	0	a	This game used to be about going fast and having fun, but once I realized that the most expensive unlocks unbalanced the hell out of the game, I dropped it. This is the definition of pay2win, which is giving those who pay money a SIGNIFICANT advantage over those who don't. Of course you could grind hundreds of battles to get those items, but at some point in time the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ devs decided to put in a speed cap. So now scouts were useless, and anyone could catch the guy with the flag, when the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game was based around going faster than the other guy. ♥♥♥♥ you Hi-Rez.

6921	0	a	no no no and no again this game is dead and for a good reason.
6922	0	a	This game used to be amazing it was fun and you could make complicated maneuvers and pass offs. you could even sneak into the enemy base to destroy the generator. But then, hi-rez studios abandoned this game for their MOBA money grab and moved on to smite. now there are cheaters and unbalanced weapons and a complete lack of servers.
6923	0	a	This game was great when I used to play it many years ago. The game itself provided such a unique experience. I am currently reinstalling it to see if the reviews are true that it no longer works. If it does not work, I'll have to change this to a thumbs down.  -Edit: So, I just tested it out and had a lot of issues with it. While trying to log in, it said that it didn't have connection to the server. After trying about 20 more time, I was allowed to log in. All of my unlocks were gone, but i had a ton of experience to use to unlock things. I decided to try to explore a map by myself to refamiliarize myself with the controls before trying to get into a real match. While trying to figure out how the loadout stuff works now, I 'lost connection' with the sever. Again. The odd thing was that after it kicked me back to the log in screen, it advertised that I could buy some sort of pack that would give me double experience. Wow. I have a feeling that this was not simply 'losing conneciton'. After trying to log in 30 or 40 more times I gave up. Every time that I did iit said that it did not have connection with the server.  Sadly this game will probably never recover from this... Anyway, Because of my recent experience I have to downvote it.
6924	0	a	I would like to start this by saying that the game isn't bad in regards to controls/graphics/stability, but this games multiplayer (literally all there is aside from training) is absolutely ♥♥♥♥ing ridiculous.   If you are okay with playing a game with a steep learning curve, against players you realistically shouldn't be gaming against as a new player, and people that honestly have such a high level of skill it is atrocious they were matched against you? Feel free to download this game, and play it to your hearts content cause that is what you will get.  Tribes: Ascend doesn't have an intelligent matchmaking system, it matches anyone against anyones, and doesn't really have a way of matching new players against new players cause FOR SOME REASON no one thought of doing that. Each time I have played this game, which is far more than my steam profile is probably going to display, I have gone up against people that are FAR beyond the skill level of my fellow new players.  Despite the fact I have tried to take the time to learn this game, oh lord have I put in the effort to master it, it is realistically impossible for me to do so under the stress of playing against people FAR beyond my skill level, especially when it tends to be an entire team of skilled players. The only way I would EVER go back to this game is if they put in place a system, which a lot of multiplayer games have in recent times, that places you against people at your own levels while restricting people of a higher skill level. They could even add in rewards for people as they go up in the ranks, into higher 'tiers' of skill, and also give an incentive for not making a new account to bypass the tiered matchmaking. Until they do something like that, which I doubt they will since this game doesn't seem to have seen an update in a while, I am never going to install it again.  TLDR: Matchmaking puts you against people far beyond your skill level, this game honestly sucks entirely for that reason, and I would only come back if they had a system in place that put you against people at your own level.
6925	0	a	banned me for no reason and i didn't even play online.
6926	0	a	What can I say, I used to play this game without steam, so it does not show the true amount of time I've spent on this. The most amazing and unique game I've played ever, which makes it even hard to say this. Its not worth your time. Developers copletely ♥♥♥♥ on it in players faces. If you are looking for extremely similar game, wait untill Midair is realesed.  On top of that, the company started working on this game not too long ago, as soon as Midair got some pre-alpha footage. Coincidence? I think not. It just shows how big of an giant tick this company is, trying to get money no matter what. I've played ~700 hours. It was worth it, but not anymore. In fact, I would have probably played this game more if devs did not continue to work on it. Now I'm just ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off. In conclusion, amazing mechanics, amazing guns, amazing teamplay and tactics and all that got ♥♥♥♥ on by a third-person MOBA.

6931	0	a	The sign-up is so broken that I, after 20 minutes, still haven't been able to sign up. First, I type and retype my password, but my 11 character password appearantly isn't in between 7 and 20 characters. After several tries, it finally goes through except it looked strange, the password fields went blank, but there was no error message. When I went to try signing in it said that the account doesnt exist. When I went to try and make my account again, it said that THE ♥♥♥♥ING EMAIL WAS BOUND TO ANOTHER ACCOUNT, AN ACCOUNT THAT APPEARANTLY DOESN'T EXIST. I'm strangely ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off at this.
6932	0	a	WAS a great game, but in my opinion the recent updates ruined it.
6933	0	a	Its been sitting on 'waiting for download' for like an hour now
6934	0	a	not worth 31 euros. play for free. get boored with it after a week. done. gg wp, next game.
6935	0	a	HiRez got their incompetent hands on a beloved IP and took a big fat steaming ♥♥♥♥ on it. Starsiege:Tribes was the best shooter ever created. HiRez should give the IP to another company that is actually passionate about restoring Tribes to its former glory. They should also beg for a thousands years of forgiveness for what they did to Tribes. ♥♥♥♥ HiRez, boycott any game from this terrible company.
6936	0	a	The game is killed by developers. Absolutely no communication or tech support, Hi-Rez moved to Smite completely. I'm still playing it, since there are sill about 10 active servers, but I'm not putting a single cent into this game. I won't support such a ♥♥♥♥♥♥s like Hi-Rez. You may ask why I have only 24 hours in the game and talking like this. It's because devs ♥♥♥♥ed up the launcher on their Steam version, that got stuck on authenticating, so I've set it up as non-steam.
6937	0	a	Don't get me wrong, this game is really fun, its a nice new takes on fps games, its fun. But theres some problems that I just can't look past. The Thumper is rediculously overpowered. It isn't even funny, noobs come inwith a weapon that can decimate a vetern squad. It's sad.The spinfuser isnt much better, but atleast you have to aim to a certain extent. The vehicles arent nearly as awesome as Id expect them to be. I can take a tank down no problem as a juggernaut, and its so damn expensive. Shrikes aren't any better. Grav cycles aren't terrible, they're cheap, go fast, and do plenty of pewpews, but they might as well be made from wet paper. Generator room camping is quite the problem, Ive had it where 3-4 people fly into my gen room, and hold it for the entire round, crippling my teams ability to attack/defend. The issue here is that theres too much cover inside of the generator room, the enemy can use it just as well as allies. Of course, it's been a good year since I've played this, and if its changed, I'll go ahead and update this.
6938	0	a	If you're looking for a game that isn't bland, go find something else. Having played for only a few hours I pretty much beat all the features, quests and got a few achievments. Basically, you just spawn in an arena, and you surive.Everyone just uses the same gun. The only thing interesting about the game was sliding and leading shots with a plasma rifle. There are 3 main classes, and other than the sliding, there isn't much to do except just slide around the map looking for noobs. A below-decent game with little to do. Unless you plan on paying, which yields you only a few items which you can toy around with.
6939	0	a	This is one of those games you'll come to play, find it fun for a couple days, then never play it again, it gets boring pretty quickly and I doubt I'll be coming back to play this anytime soon, the maps feel pretty bland for the most part, the guns are fairly decent but I think the only highlight for me is the powersliding
6940	0	a	Can't even re-install it if I wanted to, as I have my games installed on another ssd to my OS ssd, the silly launcher can't understand this, I've heard the devs left to focus on smite, shame was a fun game at first if at little unbalanced in the favour of cappers, defending the flag was madness and generally pointless but fun to attempt. Community was always a bit toxic. heard it got worse, shame another Tribes dosen't look likely, could have been something amazing.
6941	0	a	Remembered playing it a while ago. Decided to re-install it. Game never opened up. The game is dead anyways
6942	0	a	The devs are horrible at game balance.
6943	0	a	looks fun, but there is such a p2w aspect, RIP tribes
6944	0	a	Once you pierced the amniotic sac with a wire coat hanger it's over. Pouring some salt onto a corpse two years later won't magically resurrect it.
6945	0	a	The game is killed by developers. Absolutely no communication or tech support, Hi-Rez moved to Smite completely. I'm still playing it, since there are sill about 10 active servers, but I'm not putting a single cent into this game. I won't support such a ♥♥♥♥♥♥s like Hi-Rez. You may ask why I have only 24 hours in the game and talking like this. It's because devs ♥♥♥♥ed up the launcher on their Steam version, that got stuck on authenticating, so I've set it up as non-steam.
6946	0	a	Don't get me wrong, this game is really fun, its a nice new takes on fps games, its fun. But theres some problems that I just can't look past. The Thumper is rediculously overpowered. It isn't even funny, noobs come inwith a weapon that can decimate a vetern squad. It's sad.The spinfuser isnt much better, but atleast you have to aim to a certain extent. The vehicles arent nearly as awesome as Id expect them to be. I can take a tank down no problem as a juggernaut, and its so damn expensive. Shrikes aren't any better. Grav cycles aren't terrible, they're cheap, go fast, and do plenty of pewpews, but they might as well be made from wet paper. Generator room camping is quite the problem, Ive had it where 3-4 people fly into my gen room, and hold it for the entire round, crippling my teams ability to attack/defend. The issue here is that theres too much cover inside of the generator room, the enemy can use it just as well as allies. Of course, it's been a good year since I've played this, and if its changed, I'll go ahead and update this.
6947	0	a	Tried to download and play, but didn't work.   Spent hours online trying to find answers, tried everything that I could find, but game still wouldn't work.  I believe I even contacted their support but received no reply.  I never even got to the menu screen.
6948	0	a	Rest in peace, Tribes Ascend, you will be missed :(  This was a really good game, but the devs just didn't treat it the way it should have been. I cannot recommend the game at this point, as barely anyone plays it, and Hi Rez have confirmed that the game will be over, after one final update...
6949	0	a	This was a good game untill the launcher stopped workin... fix it plz 
6950	0	a	An okay game at best, community is dead though.

6954	0	a	Was good until the developers abandoned the game. Unfortunately, so did the community. If I had been able to write reviews a long time ago, I'd have given this a thumbs up. But now, I can't recommend this.
6955	0	a	Me: 'Hey guys, I'm new, can you give me some tips?' [l33tsc0p3s]xXxPr0Tr1b3sAsc3ndPlyrxXx: 'Omg, go play on a server for new players' Me: 'But this is the only server that isn't dead' [l33tsc0p3s]xXxPr0Tr1b3sAsc3ndPlyrxXx: 'Who cares go on a server for new players' The point: O Him: ---------------------&gt;
6956	0	a	So I played this back when it came out. I was pretty ok at it. Now I've tried to get back into it. And to be honest? Not worth it, so many less games and so many less players and then half the players that are on? have feaking aimbots. There is no way you can aim fast enough that every shot you fire hits the guy as he flies past you at max speed. Not worth it any more. and the 'DLC'? Hell no. Waist of money
6957	0	a	Got old quick.
6958	0	a	THESE DEVS ARE ABSOLUTE ♥♥♥♥♥ THEY ABANDONED TRIBES FOR THAT ♥♥♥♥ GAME SMITE
6959	0	a	fun gameplay, ♥♥♥♥ unlock system. all I could see in my not very bright T: A future was grinding, grinding, grinding. a prospect that I didn't like in the slightest.   could be fun with a different model and continued dev support.
6960	0	a	This game made me realize that we will never have a good fast paced shooter ever again!   I mean homing rocket launcher. I repeat HOMING ♥♥♥♥ING INSTA KILL ROCKET LAUNCHER.  What happened to skill. And as if that wasn't enough it has micro transactions. In my opinion this game could easily have been one my top 10 fps games. But since they decided to prioritize profit over fun they completely ruined everything this game had going for it.
6961	0	a	this game could use an update a BIG update the sights are to small it takes 4 to 5 shots WITH A SNIPER RIFLE! to kill an enimmy the game is magerly hacked with no way to report it, the game is not noob frendly wich is ok but serisely 4 TO 5 SHOTS...WITH A SNIPER RIFLE!!!!
6962	0	a	A very poorly balanced 'Free to Pay' game. No customization at the start. Paying players are instantly recognizable in that they are not cannon fodder, and you are. It sometimes felt like they stopped just short of having purchasable consumables that win the current game for you.
6963	0	a	Although the 'skiing' system is original and quite interesting, a lack of better class equality and  much  better graphics (because the graphics of this game are of cube 2 level, and that's a bit of a shame for a  new  PC game), coupled with a few bugs and annoying glitches like the fact that spawn points are completely random it seems...  All in all, you can try this game if you want, well it's free after all, but in my opinion, if you want a really good free FPS game, go play Planetside 2 which is on a completely other level. (well it's not really the same budget to start with).  My final rating is 4/10, because it's not because a game is free that anything goes, even if there are some original points and ideas included in the package, I don't consider it to be enough to get more than that rating.
6964	0	a	The little game that couldn't. Tribes: Ascend failed to bring in the perpetual revenue that the developers had hoped for it, and is now all but abandoned under the feet of the mega-success Smite. With a now faltering community, Tribes: Ascend seems to have it's days numbered.  The base game is still playable, and incredibly fun, and even worth a look, but sadly, don't expect updates, or a continuous thriving player-base.
6965	0	a	Not really a good game. After you get over the jet ski part you will be like WTF am i playing. You will then experience the people who have been playing for years and 'mastered' all the maps and weps and you will be destroyed o.o
6966	0	a	I like the gliding aspect ofther than that it pretty much suchs. 1/10
6967	0	a	This game fell off of the face of the Earth, sadly. It was good.  ...Then again, SMITE sounds pretty good right now.
6968	0	a	It's an okay game, but for me it was hard to find a full server to play and then the gameplay was still kinda slow. Give it a try you might like it.
6969	0	a	Do NOT buy. Nobody plays this, and the devs abandoned it in favor of SMITE.
6970	0	a	The difficulty curve on this game is insane. If you don't put loads of hours into getting a decent shot then odds are, you're going to be outclassed in every way possible. Especially since there are others who have so much experience with the mechanics already. If you're willing to put in the effort then I see where the game could be good for you, but for myself, it's just a ragefest as I curse the other team for being so much better than me. But that's just how multiplayer games seem to go.

6972	0	a	Game was great 2 years ago. Would definetly recommended it at that point.  The game is unbalanced and slowly becomes repetitive now. Lack of custom mod and map support to blame for it all. Also, the f2p 'earn' model is too much of a hill climb, especially when paying players can get the items and guns way faster (and sometimes even being better suited for certain classes) that knock you down the hill.  Servers are also decreasing in quality and amount of players quickly.
6973	0	a	In a nuttshell. If you like tactical shooters, this is not for you. It may be advertised as such, but the game seems to abandon tactics and just shoves pepper up every a-hole. Your biggest 'skill set' in this game is the lack of ability of your oponent to track you properly. If you feel like frantic rushes and spray and pray type of gameplay, this is your thing.

6978	0	a	The game is too complicated and cannot compare to what it was before. Also, jumpping into a quick match most of the time puts you in an empty server or in a server with players with skill level far beyond yours. All this makes a new player quit easily. Too bad that hirez have smite and ascend gets 0 attention.

6990	0	a	Game is like a smaller version of planetside 2.  you spawn, you die from people who have played the game for ages, have all the best equipment and know all the spawn points.  wouldnt even say the graphics are any good.  dont waste your time installing this game, unless you like dieing quickly.  0/10
6991	0	a	If Hi-Rez didn't abandon this game and make it pay to win, it would still be fun. The ridiculously fast pace and unlikelyhood that you would actually hit someone was refreshing for the first person shooter genre. But, as stated, Hi-Rez let it keel over and die. If it were 3-4 years in the past I would highly recommend this game, but now it's just not worth your time (and $$$).

6999	0	a	I'm not even sure what sort of state T:A is in these days, judging by word of mouth it's been overrun by cheaters. For a time it was a pretty marvelous game, unparalleled sense of speed, fairly balanced and rewarding unlocks that skew heavily towards payment incentive but there were some reasonable deals on item packs. It was a lot of fun.  What actually made me remove the game, though, was the mandatory update process (which, despite the option being there, could NOT be disabled) that runs in the background 24/7, launches with your computer, and cannot be disabled except by command line prompt maraudery that then makes the game refuse to start because the update process isn't running. It wasn't doing anything malicious other than being there without permission, but I don't like that sort of ♥♥♥♥ on my comptuer.  Such a shame, really.
7000	0	a	The game itself is very solid and ans some amazing mechanics. The skiing and combat is fast paced and action packed. The main problems lie in the learning curve and the cheaters. T:A offers a tutorial area and guides to get you started, but really you should just play to see what works for you. If you want to do something faster or better, there are YouTube videos of how to do it.   Hackers. They're not maggot-infested in the servers but they are a reality. Kicking people is very hard because 80% of the players in-game must agree, and no more than 2 people can vote no. Hi-Rez has 100% completely abandoned this game to work on Smite. There is no longer any form of tech support or patch fixing etc.   If you can work through the learning curve, and find games without hackers, then it's a solid game for those with the patience to play it.   However, you're looking for a fun new fps to get into, look away. This one comes with a lot of early game stress and frustration.  The F2P model is pretty good, everything in game can be purchased with in-game credits. Premium currency can buy the same weapons and upgrades, but these are balanced and not game-breaking. Everything in this game has a counter to it.

7006	0	a	game wont start because of hi rez updatenot starting
7007	0	a	The game sucks
7008	0	a	This game only exists because of it's far supererior predecesor; Tribes 2. Hi-Rez took over the development, having never made a first person shooter before, and turned a unique shooter style into a bad Halo/CoD mix, with jet packs. Pay to Win is ridiculous, with guns taking twenty or thirty hours to 'purchase' with in game currency. And of course, as with all bad F2P games, the developers abandoned it to work on something else (also not a FPS game).
7009	0	a	Because of what this company has done to this great game I will not ever touch anything from HiRez.  They one of the best franchises with greedy and literal pay to win. Every week a new OP weapon was released and every week more players quit this game - and now its dead. Good job hirez.
7010	0	a	ITS AWSOME but deserted by developers  game offers you a lot of manuverbility no matter what class wich makes aiming extreamply difficult especaly for bolt actions weapons that mostly are in the game oh yes and those weapon shot bolts that took quite some time to travel  its rly fun being able to skii around and shoot eachother while capturing flags  if you haved tryed it it will probably offer you hours of fun but this game being desrted means that this is its FINAL version there was endless sutff that could have been added but devs switched to moba games....yay......................

7019	0	a	As a recovering Tribes2 addict, I can't recommend this one at all. Is like Krokodile...You WANT your fix...but all you get is flesh rot and exposed bones. Nothing feels modernized or improved and the devs seem to have abandoned it. Asthetically, the game looks like it's from 2005 or so. With everything cranked all the way up, it still looked terrible. The gameplay was decent, but I'm not so hard-up for an FPS fix that I need to put up with such basic-looking graphics or so many install/patch issues.  WTF happened? In an dusty attic somewhere...there's a painting of this title getting prettier...

7029	0	a	I want to love this game, I really do.   But the only weapon anyone uses is the Spinfuser. It does a lot of damage in an aoe at any range, and fires fairly rapidly. Multiple version of it across different classes, and the only way to counter it is to go a beefy class that also has a spinfuser. Game would be a lot more fun without the weapon.   Note to Hirez: If 80% of the kills in the game are to one specific weapon, that may be a hint it needs a nerf or just straight up removal.   Edit: According to the other reviews, Hirez has abandoned this game, so it's probably safe to say it'll never be fixed.

7043	0	a	The changes this game has gone through instantly put me off. The classes were taken away, replaced with armor types. There's only 2 good guns that mostly EVERYONE uses. I tried even using the snipers because I love sniping. The one sniper I had took away my fuel to do damage. SO I could barely escape from fights. ALSO it has no AOE dmg in a game where everyone is a ♥♥♥♥ing sonic clone and goes fast as hell. I don't want to be a bandwagon and follow everyone using the op weapons, but if you want to progress, that's your choice. Not to mention the grinding you need for currency.  Guide to this Game: Go Heavy Armor, Get any explosive weapon, go wild. 12/10 would do again.

7054	0	a	Don't waste your time, especially if you don't have a super fast internet connection (ping), as it makes a big difference. It's loaded with hackers that cheat and use exploits. The developers don't seem to care. The game is basicially unplayable. I play it once in while just to see if the devs fix the problem, but so far no luck.
7055	0	a	This game used to be good... I've been a beta tester for 20 years now and I beta tested this game and it was fun, now it is pay to win and the devs cheat for paying players. I do not suggest you play this game unless you want to be beaten by 12 year olds whose parents paid for them to have the best weapons and then have the devs cheat for them on top of that.  Do NOT play this game you will not have fun unless you just want to ski around and get shot by 12 year olds.

7065	0	a	Tribes: Ascend is a pointless game. You jump and shoot on large maps. It might be funny. But after all that playing you will reflect what is the meaning of this game. I found funnier to plant flowers instead of playing this ♥♥♥♥.

7071	0	a	i would like to add in here, umm . . . not a chance this game is for steers and queers. really fast steers and queers, so fast that you will play a 40 second match, die 300 times and take a never ending ♥♥♥♥, which the aftermath will leave you epileptic . . . 10/10 would stab whoever created this disasterous god awful mess they call a first person shooter.
7072	0	a	Balancing is a serious problem. Sniper class is useless.  No teamwork by the community or integrated by game mechanics.  Kills require mainly luck, not skill, because of the mechanics.  Pretty boring, weapons are weaksauce, hit detection is unbearable (Almost COD level).  Maybe if the devs cared and updated the problems, it would be worth playing. But right now, no good.  1/10  (a point for the skiing mechanic, it's at least interesting... for about 10 minutes.)
7073	0	a	If your wondering if this is anything like halo, it's NOT! I repeat, it NOT. I downloaded this because it looked awesome and similar to halo 3, but it's anything but... the only thing it has going for it is that it has unique mechanics. I'm so very disappointed... :'''''(

7082	0	a	R.I.P. Can't go fast anymore.  **Don't believe the Steam stats, I have put more than 50-75+ hours into this game**  A long time ago during the beta for this game, you could go as fast as you wanted, and that's what gave this game meaning. Hi-Rez has since implemented a speedcap, patched multiple rock-bouncing spots and overall killed that thing that gave the game meaning. On top of making the game 'free-to-pay' with their Jewish cash shop, they turned on their community and forced them to grind as much as a League of Legends non-paying player to unlock a single weapon, then they go and stopped updating the game altogether.  Please don't be a follower in the False Prophet known as Hi-Rez and don't buy into their lies... with any of their games.

This game goes to the garbage can. 4/10 for trying to wash away my money.
7090	0	a	Dead game.dead allies.hype is dead.everybody playing dead serious.this game is even deader then my attempt to rhyme and make joke.take the first to words of this review as my entire review
7091	0	a	Interesting concepts that tell it apart from most other FPS games; apart from that though, everything else is just sub-par. Relatively high skill floor AND skill ceiling, and a new player would find himself struggling for frags. Would only recommend this game for its innovative character movements; nothing else.

7098	0	a	Was good but is now dead...
7099	0	a	The only good thing this game has to offer is its unique movement system, which is meant to place players on some sort of hoverboard and move around a map ridiculously fast. Due to this, the only weapons that members of the community use are the sniper, and a grenade launcher. Beyond the movement, this game offers nothing new or unique to the industry.
7100	0	a	I DO NOT recomend this game anymore at all. Buying the ultimate wepons pack is a hudge mistake. First of all after downoading the game, you cant launch it because of some glith about the licenses. If you manage to solve that (by reading lots of diferent instrictions about it, installing and uninstalling like 10 times your game and modifying steam foders) then there is a problem for like a hudge percentage of users. SOUTH AMERICA acounts are no longer suported. No mater what you do you wont find a way to create an acount if you are from south america. It says something about another company called LevelUp that aparently manages south american acounts. didnt find a link to that or instructions on how to create it. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR WASTING 24 HRS OF YOUR DAY WITHOUT MAKING ANY PROGRESS OR BEING ABLE TO PLAY ANYTHING THEN THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU.
7101	0	a	this game is a game i find super fun. its just that little people play it and if a few more people played it i would definetly recomand this but people these days are just rich and have this stupid idea that if its a free game its bad. me i dont think a free game can ever deserve a bad rating but if its a matter of should you play it today then i will say no to some of the old fun games.

7111	0	a	This has been by far one of my favorite gamesup till the recent patch which literally makes the game unfun and boring. Waking up and trying to grind and get better at it to buy upgrades and new weapons was my routine till the patched it. Now everything is unlocked and now it just feels like a boring shooter with everything unlocked except for skins. And as an added bonus they refund all the xp points and the real game money which shows that theyre useless now. A once beloved game, patched into a boring no purpose shooter.

7121	0	a	I would like to play and/or review this 'game'.. but after Steam download 2 curious things happened:  1) While installation I was told that the game need some 3rd party software to be installed. I was not told which software, how many programs or why I need them. I had to confirm this. The game installed then software which I actually don't know what it's good for or where it is installed. I just found some infos after installation in the forums.. but I'm not sure if there will stay crap software after deinstalling the game. Looks &amp; feels more like malware instead of gaming software.  2) After installation and starting the game.. I was told that I need an external account to play the game. After clicking the 'create account' button the game freezed 5 minutes or so with curious window look. The I was able to create an account. But I was not able to login because I need to click the activation link in the email sent to me. After one day.. there is still no activation link or mail.  The videos, pictures and description looks nice.. but actually I'm not sure what this download is. I have seen just the login screen which is not working for me. Could be a game.. or malware.. or a browser.. or a mp3 player. I don't know.  I had just 0.1 hours 'ingame' at the login screen.. so I had to wait +0.1 hours to be able to write this review. LoL  I cannot recommend this game for anyone. And since other reviewers told us that the developers have stopped work on the 'game' ( means no more updates or fixes ).. I would not pay any cent into it or waste time with download or something.

7128	0	a	if you're too poor to get anything else,   this is the game for you.
7129	0	a	has the look and feel of a promising game had it been released 2 years ago. Word has recently come around that hi-rez is finally making game changes that fans screamed for at it's original release. This effort is too little, too late in my opinion, as the player base is already dead and thus so is the game.
7130	0	a	Pretty fun for a while, unfortunetly the entire game revolves around spaming explosives against screaming idiots, because thats the only community that is left on this game. of all the time i played it there was maybe 100 people in servers, maybe. Honestly its a great game aside from the fact everyone abuses rockets forcing only one or two playable classes and its dead community.

7138	0	a	This is just a bad game, if i would say is it worth the effort? No, not really.It was fun to play the old days but now it has no updates no weapon rewards nothing. It takes about 2 weeks of playing to get a new weapon if youre lucky. The autobalance system is just bad.Only the veteran players who keep loyal to the game still play this.

7143	0	a	Literally the worst login/register system i've ever seen. I had to reset my password several times before i could log in. The temp one they sent didn't work even copy/pasted. I eventually manage to log in (after many resets). I'm told to choose a name. I do. It gives terms and conditions, i accept. Told to choose a name again. The cycle continues.  10/10 would attempt login again.
7144	0	a	Tried to launch the game, got stuck on 'Tribes Ascend is waiting for verification'. Tried reinstalling, tried every single direction and guide online that I could find, tried manually installing pre-reqs, restarting my PC, everything. The game wouldn't launch. None of the other ~300 or so games in my Steam library give me any issues at all. Thanks for wasting so much of my time.
7145	0	a	If you loved the Annihilation mod (or football) from the old tribes and didnt care for the base game then you may not be able to get into this. I was one of those folks that scoffed at the plain tribes because of its lack of base defense structures or strategy beyond -Go really fast ftw-  This game is much like that but worse in some ways.   Gone are the deadly plasma &amp; missile turrets, huge maps and large bases. Wanna repair your generator? Dont, your just wasting time with a game element that doesnt work. Your better off ignoring the inventory stations, plasma turrets and generator because everyone can move so fast that nothing can stop them. Go outside and just fight like everyone else because they already know that base utilities are useless (you spawn with all your gear instead of having to outfit yourself before you move out like old tribes so yey no strategy just GO GO GO). The weapons are not balanced imo and it seems obvious since everyone uses the same gear that is the best. Remember the laser rifle? It was feared by flag snatchers. Now its just a pathetic tribute to an old weapon because its no longer effective like the good old days.  This game really is just a twitch shooter engineered to make you spend real $ with the illusion of some base management. Couple that with a new rank system that limits what servers you can enter with a small player base, micro transactions and everything horrible that follows that MO.   If you can handle all that crap then you better have some skills son because the old vets and new blood are playing this now and they will serve you your own ♥♥♥ on a Spinfusor disc before you can say 'Shazbot!'  Very disappointing. EA Dungeon Keeper disappointing.
7146	0	a	Do not play this or purchase it's DLC. The steam version breaks randomly and CAN NOT BE FIXED. Even if you completely re-install it. No idea what causes it but the devs have no intention of fixing it.  To play this game follow the below instructions!  1. Download and Run the following exe.  'http://hirez.http.internapcdn.net/hirez/InstallHiRezGamesEnglish.exe'   2. Create the following shortcut. 'C:\Program Files (x86)\Hi-Rez Studios\HiRezLauncherUI.exe game=200 product=10'  3. Run that shortcut, it will do all the setup &amp; install.  If you do not create the shortcut it will try to make you purchase/launch Smite.
7147	0	a	I played this game back in 2012 and it was pretty cool. Then Hi-Rez ditched it for their new toy Smite. Whatever, a company has to make money, I can understand. On a whim I decided to reinstall and see what they'd done with it. Downloading from their website worked fine until the game needed to install Adobe Flash of all things, which doesnt work because the specific version is an old one which Adobe doesnt allow. Fine. I uninstall and try the Steam version. The first time setup demands I restart my computer. Fine. The game launcher can't even find the servers now, but hold on! The game launcher now needs an update. Fine. This update involves another Hi Rez executable which crashes a third of the way through demanding that I restart my computer. Why in the world does this game need 7 redistributables to RUN THE LAUNCHER. Why don't they use the Steam 'First Time Setup' thing to update all this stuff instead. Maybe they should've stolen the  Battle.net  API from Blizzard at the same time they were stealing all the Paladins characters from Overwatch.  0/10 I Literally cannot install the game anymore. ♥♥♥♥ you Hi Rez.

7154	0	a	I love the game, however thumbs down for too many idiots and trolls on this game who keep spamming noises. No way to block them, no way to report them, no way to ban them. (On official servers anyway)  Specially now that school is closed for the holiday these pimpled faced dweebs have nothing better to do then ruin games.
7155	0	a	So I read PCGamer's article about 'The Best FPS of all time'. Needless to say, this game was up there. So, I decided to check it out.  I'm confronted with a game that despite recieving many awards has a crappy launcher that doesn't work properly, and instead of letting me actually PLAY the game, just shows me the EULA agreement over and over, even when I accept it.  Don't waste the 4GB of computer space this takes up. It's not worth it.
7156	0	a	Dumb asses need to fix their bugs. Downloaded and want to try the game but gets a dumb ♥♥♥ error in launcher saying 'Tribes Ascend is unable to find Steam installation' Also it is ♥♥♥♥ing stupid to need to play 5 minutes of the game before writing a review because this dumb ♥♥♥ bug can be found in the first minute of the game.

7168	0	a	You have to do mad amounts of meth to play this game. FACT! 
7169	0	a	Well, the game has great potential. However, it seems sooooo unfinished, and there's not so much content to it. It can be fun for a bit if you play with your friend, but you will get bored af after few hours... There isn't that much players, too. Idea of the game is pretty good, but execution is awful. You can try it out, but you'll probably uninstall it very damn fast.
7170	0	a	It was a good game, but it's changed a lot since last I played, it was fine how it was before aside from the FPS drops every now and then, I mean come on, if it's only got one minor problem don't ♥♥♥♥ing reskin it and crap it out like 'WE FIXED IT' (though you didn't cause the FPS is still ♥♥♥♥♥), when I came back I noticed that I had only the starting weapons, and the starting amount of XP, all of the XP I earned by playing this laggy as hell game, with only a handful of good players that would only be on my team half the time, all of the crap I unlocked with said XP, was gone, and I seem to recall being level 16, almost level 17, with around 180,000 XP give or take, but when I came back I was only ♥♥♥♥ing level 6, all of the classes were changed to have 'default' loadouts that were just named 'loadout 1' 'loadout 2' 'loadout 3' and so and and so forth, pretty much forcing you to take the time that you could be spending playing the game and possibly having fun to look at all the weapons for each class (light, medium, and heavy, by the way) and make and rename each ♥♥♥♥ing loadout yourself, it was much better when the loadouts were already there, made and named, I could just choose a class and choose a loadout like for example I choose light class, I could choose sniper, infiltrator, assassin, or with medium, there was soldier, and engineer, and a few others (I haven't memorized all of the classes), there was brute in heavy, I can't remember the name of the other heavy class I used, but my point is, they didn't need to alter the classes, it was (almost) perfectly fine the way it was! the only thing that needed fixing was whatever was causing the random lag spikes that could ruin a perfectly good game!  TL;DR it was good, they changed it too much, now it sucks balls, and I hope whoever thought the changes were a good idea steps on a very sharp and pointy lego.

Too little and too late they tried to fix you by cathering to the elitist userbase who did not wanted a better game (a game that would attract all of the players from years past) but a game centered on their favorite weapons/class and getting rid of classes that they didnt like.  May this teach you to not listen to certain internet communities, and concentrate on the main idea of the game (flag drag??)  And if you wonder why i only got 15 hours in game, remember the game wasnt on steam before.
7178	0	a	I can't even install this ♥♥♥♥ing game, i updated it on my steam but now i have to deal with the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ing launcher that wont update the game. It says i have 16 hours on record, but 6 of those were leaving the launcher open.  0/10 since your ♥♥♥♥ launcher wont work properly.

7197	0	a	Well, for a sequel to the series it did well I think. You have a variety of classe to choose from, as well differnet customizations, so almost anyone can find a class and make it suite their playstyle. The skiing mechanic is interesting, definitely changes things up a little, but it's nothing more than a gimmick, it loses it's appeal fast. Unfortunately one of the largest issues with the game is that high level players can join servers that're set for lower ranks, causing players to get frustrated quickly. That coupled with the fact that the base design on almost every map favors an attacker makes me wonder what hirez were thinking when they made this. The graphics are nice, wouldn't say they're the best but certainly not the worst either, but you're probably better off playing some other shooter than this one. Can't recommend this game to anyone short of fans of the series.

7207	0	a	I have about 210(209.9) hours of play time into this game, and i can say that before Hi-rez left the game for Smite it was one of the best FPS games out there and now with the release of Paladins the game doesnt even work. Recently i tried to logon to my hirez account in Tribes and it just says i dont have access to the game. I wiah i could recomend this game, and i would, if it worked. This product is just an example of poor developers abandoning one of their most favorable products(in my opinion). Hirez could have made updates for the game to make it better and draw more attention to it, but sadly that did not happen.  R.I.P Trobes Assend 100B.C-101B.C

7246	0	a	This game didn't make a good first impression on me. My friends said it was super fun, but I didn't like it very much. I like the aspect of sliding down hills to gain momentum and using a jetpack and such, but the controls are so odd and out of the ordinary, not like any other shooter. I mean, I get that this game wanted to be different, but a lot of people who play games with a common genre are going to expect similar controls, and when you give them very random controls, it isn't very fun trying to learn a new layout. For example, I am used to jumping (or using a jetpack/flying) in other games with the space bar, but you ski using the space bar. I normally expect to sprint with shift, but instead AIMING is on shift. How does that make any sense? Most games use the right mouse button to aim. One more thing, you don't just drop a game that is still very popular just to make or work on another game. Hi-Rez started working on Smite and just dropped this game. They used to try to make the best gaming experience, but now they are working super hard on Smite, which isn't even a fun game to begin with (in my opinion). All-In-All, Hi-Rez has to learn how to manage two games at once, like Activision. They could have two teams, one for Tribes and one for Smite. Activision has Treyarch working on games to be produced every other year, and Activision has Infinity Ward working on games to produce every other year, so that a Call of Duty game is made one year by Treyarch, and then the next year by Infinity Ward. If Hi-Rez had two teams for Tribes and Smite, Tribes might actually still be a good game. Ok, my rant is over.
7247	0	a	Everything is way too fast to be fun. There's giant gaps of time between each 'fight' which consists of a shot being fired from each person and then both you you sliding away

7279	0	a	A year ago I wouldve given this game a 100000/10, yet I am forced to push players away from this near perfect arena shooter, as nobody else plays it. The momentum, the feeling of zooming down a hill, launching up into the sky, and jetpacking your way into the enemy base, taking out three of your opponents, stealing their flag, and capping, while still feeling like you earned, is unmatched. Sadly, as I log on every week or so, I see the servers emptying, and I cry. Stay away from Tribes: Ascend, as playing it will only end in dissapointment

7284	0	a	I do not know why HiRez made this game worse.. but they did. You cannot one-shot people anymore, a light armor can survive a mortar to the face which is not very tribes1/2-like The combat no longer requires aiming, just how fast you can switch weapons and aim in someone elses general diection With the new weapon categories you can basically just load up on explosives and win the game Its almost impossible to base raid anymore because you cant one shot people with all the turrets and mediums loaded to the teeth with explosive weapons and cant be one shot anymore Stealth is an absolute joke now because after you shocklance someone.. they dont die and you are stuck with your thumb in your dischole with no energy as they go airborne and rain death on you with their arsenal of explosive weapons they can switch to instantly Flag capping is a whole nother story, sniping does junk for damage now and chasing revolves around you already having a good speed already and happen to be traveling in the same direction or your flag is long gone. On top of everything else these new maps are HUGE and you cant even zoom in very far. HiRez really should stick to MOBAs and sell off the Tribes IP to people who know what they are doing

7291	0	a	I decided to try it out because it looked pretty neat. After a few hours of playing capture the flag I realized how frustrating killing the enemy flag carrier was. They may not be able to regen health, but their jet fuel still regens, too quickly I might add. The same as every player. The jets are more of an annoyance than a cool feature. The weapons arent really accurate enough to hit decent shots unless you use explosives. I don't see many people using the regular guns. Probably because you can't hit your mark 85% of the time with them. I would only reccomend this to a player who has the patience to hunt down a flag carrier for 14 minutes just to be able to plant your teams flag again to score a point.  This was an entire waste of 2 and a half hours.
7292	0	a	Before First Patch Update : Pros : - Full of Fun  - 9 Good, unique, and Balanced Loadout  - Maps were Large, worth of play  Cons : - Waiting For the next update,maybe the game is dead.  After First Patch Update:  Pros : - New Map  Cons : - Classes were shorted into 3 Classes,making it more harder to choose and confusing  - New maps were buggy and uncreative ( By Uncreative i mean the map is not large)  - Supposed to be a fun game,but becoming worst  my review be like : Before : 10.9/10 Just Play it,Dont Read it.  After : -1/10 enough,better do chores than playing this game after after update.  P.S. : This game were supposed to be fun,people waoting this patch, but not like this. Some old players waited for the update but it turn out like ths? enough, I'm Done playing.  P.P.S. : still, good game old Tribes.

7310	0	a	South Park once posed the question, 'How do you kill that which has no life?'  Hi-Rez Studios provided a pretty strong answer.    Game nominated for the 'Most Likely To Give You Cancer' award.
7311	0	a	 Disclaimer: If you do not possess a functional Time Machine, this review is not for you.    Time Travelers! Welcome, I speak to you from the year 2015, If you are reading this message then you didn't travel back enough, the game you are examining on this page is in the worst state at the time of the writing of this review.  Consider travelling back further in time to 2012, at that year Tribes was actually one of the best games out there. Sadly, Hi-Rez abandoned it for SMITE. and I am sure that is doubly humorous to you, seeing how you come from the future and you know how much of a huge failure that stupid game turned out to be.  Move along.
7312	0	a	Tribes Ascend, Oh Boy  Listen, I Actuelly Like This Game, its just that i cant play it anymore Why? Because the Devs ♥♥♥♥ED Everything up with the update The game wont start because it REQUIRES you to have the Hi-Rez Authentification ♥♥♥♥, Which I Have, BUT IT DOESNT EVEN WORK AND IT STILL WONT LET ME PLAY, also The Out Of The Blue update will be ♥♥♥♥ heres why  Ruined The Perfect Class System Only Slightly Tweaked The Multiplayer Did Sweet FA About The Bugs And Just Said SCREW IT, LETS RELEASE AN UPDATE THAT ♥♥♥♥S EVERYTHING OVER AND DOESNT HAVE ANY BUG FIXES SO WE CAN GET BACK TO WORK ON OUR PIECE OF ♥♥♥♥ MONEY PRINTER GAME SMITE
7313	0	a	If you like fast paced games this ones for you. But I personnaly dislike this genre of shooters so I don't like it.
7314	0	a	Don't even bother, this game is pretty much dead, the graphics are out of date and the gameplay is akward and clunky. Go play Smite instead.
7315	0	a	This game si for ♥♥♥♥ when you starting playing you have versus you the higgest players this game has to be deleted from world,
7316	0	a	0/10 Could even load game without an acount and it wouldnt load when i try to make an acount. Dont waste your time on this game.
7317	0	a	♥♥♥♥
7318	0	a	Probably the worst of the Tribes franchise
7319	0	a	The game is super fast paced and and controls are really weird I didn't even know how to Heal myself with a healing station and everyone just uses the Heavy with Impact guns because the Heavy speed isn't reduced or it doesn't have any less than the light it takes a lot of xp to get one gun and the maps are really hard for defence because they are around hills and everything shows on the enemy map.
7320	0	a	Downloaded from steam then had to create Hi-Rez account because launcher wouldn't authenticate, but gave no clear reason as to why. Followed verification email link and account got verified. Logged into launcher and game launches. Game then requires you TO LOG IN AGAIN!? Game login doesn't work... read forums and redo password/authentication. I can now log into game.  Game sucks and is nothing like advertised on store page. No classes, no progression, just a shooter that looks like it's from the late 90s. Thanks Steam and thanks Hi-Rez for being completely inept.   Unintalled.

7322	0	a	Pice of **** if you understand me, no basic tutorial of each class you have to just movment jump and jackpack basic tutorial , then throws you out in the PvP ... not funny don't even think to install this if you'r not an old player of this game :|
7323	0	a	I got this, thinking it would sorta be like Planetside 2. Nope, it's even worse. The community is pretty bad, the game itself is ok, but if you want to get this, I warn you: Prepare to be destroyed by level 100 guns and by guys with level 100 armour. There will be 6 year-olds who have paid $120 to win this game, and have 1 experience point overall. It's kinda sad really.
7324	0	a	Short review: Game offers a unique movement system that is really fun, definetly the best part of the game. What makes me not recommend it? The weapon balance. It seems like the only weapon that is really viable and strong is the 'spinfusor' - a weapon that fires a spinning grenade that detonates on impact (player or ground). All other weapons DONT EVEN NEARLY have the same amount of damage like this weapon. Even those weapons that are relatively hard to use, like the sniper rifle ARE NOT REWARDING if you hit an enemy, not even if you hit them in the head.  The Spinfusor will still outdamage it, even if not a direct hit.  TL;DR Move on to the next game, this one will only keep you busy for a few minutes until you realize only 1 weapon is viable.
7325	0	a	Worse Tribes game in existance, HiRez needs ♥♥♥ cancer
7326	0	a	got perm banned for no reason dont buy
7327	0	a	the game and the company doesn't want me to play it. how is that productive?
7328	0	a	I already gave up on the login part cause it causes too much pain. I made an account with google then tried logging in the i dont know my password and other crap....................
7329	0	a	Just nope
7330	0	a	nothing even works in this game, joining servers included  its also really boring
7331	0	a	Graphics are good, but the gameplay isn't. It is purely jumping around with a jetpack and sliding. Also the game was way too easy, you can easily get kills, but instead you see people jumping and sliding like an idiot and shooting blindly. You can always try, but I did not like this game
7332	0	a	i've played this for 3 years and i got like 7 kills total. it's really hard to hit someone and the only thing you can basically do is glide and fly around. the whole game is total CHAOS and everybody is just ♥♥♥♥ing around, wich like i said: makes it almost IMPOSSIBLE to hit each other. i do not recommend this game and i absolutely do not get why it was game of the year. if you want to buy this, it's your choice, but remember i warned you.
7333	0	a	so i attempted to play this game; i firstly had an issue with some manner of Hirez varification, or whatever, before i could even begin to play the game (this was already annoying). it ran for about 10 minutes (during which i was utterly bored due to lack of players on any of the servers) and then it crashed. i attempted to re-install but the game just wasn't on my games list anymore. it seems as though they have just given up on a potentially good game and left it to whither and die in the dust. pathetic.
7334	0	a	How do I start with this game. First of all, the name. Tribes Ascend? Makes it sound like an epic game, but in reality its just a bunch of super space soldiers fighting over nothing, while sliding down hills as their main mode of transportation. Nothing says manlier than sliding down hills, right? Second of all, I can't tell if this takes place in the future or the future future. What year is it? Why does it look primitive yet futuristic? There is no story, no timeline, nothing. For all we know this is a lost episode of Scooby Doo. All in all, I'd say give this game a pass. No clear storyline, and its kinda of boring at times when it should be action packed. It was a disappointing experience.
7335	0	a	Tribes acend sucks asssssssss, if you want to play another one of those free to play first person shooters this is the game for you. If you like to skateboard this is also the game for you. If you have at least half a brain then you already knew from the title that this game sucks ♥♥♥. It was made by three developers, one who killed himself and the other two who are living in iceland with their combined $500,000 which they made of this game. After playing this game i can only say one thing and thats that i really wish i could take back the time i used up playing this ♥♥♥♥ and the time i took writing the review. I have homework i should be doing.
7336	0	a	hey anyone who even thinks about downloading this game.DO NOT. the game has only 2 game mod tdm and cft. there is this gun that is op and everyone uses it.
7337	0	a	Out of the blue update fixed some issues but added twice as many I can't recommend the game after this update and many fixes
7338	0	a	man i tried to jetpack but some aggressive pelvis done killed me how am i supposed to play without the jetpack the maps are like wow
7339	0	a	boring sh*t
7340	0	a	Ithas worse graphics than TF2 despite coming out 7 years later, barely any weapons, or anything at all.
7341	0	a	i wont sa it is bad i just find the controls really bad and the aiming is awful, when i play a game that has a dot as your reticle then i expect to be able to look down my sight why can't i do that it is really hard and can actually be done in real life so i recommend this game to people who have time to learn how to play it.
7342	0	a	Honestly wtf is this quality. This game sucks xD... and no tutorial?
7343	0	a	the worst game of hi-rez
7344	0	a	Great type of game, but no PVE modes vs AI bots. No play
7345	0	a	this could be a great game about shooting stuff at sanic speed but too bad that hirez is the literal definition of supreme retardness you can go look for the word 'retardness' at any dictionary of your liking that unless your blind you can be sure as hell you ll find 'hirez' written somwhere between the lines, and no1 plays this shet, the few people that do are a bunch of cooksucking fktards who should get cancer VGTA VGTA VGTA
7346	0	a	This game sucks because...  It's too similiar to halo  It's too similiar to COD (because of the jetpacks)  The graphics sucks (worse then Minecraft)  Worse community then Warz ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Note: This is a completely fair review, if you don't agree you don't belong here 
7347	0	a	Played 3 matches, pretty ♥♥♥♥ing buggy, got stuck in the terrain several times on 2 different maps, gameplay is alright but I remember playing a free browser based game some years ago just like this but alot more solid, funnily enough.  Tho, no vehicles (not that anyone really uses them as far as ive seen)
7348	0	a	Game looks interesting. Much like the rest of Hi-Rez games, they are just rip off's of other games. The Sku thing was new and kinda interesting until you realize that 95% of this game is about skiing and shooting the starting weapon. No point in any other weapon other than a pistol. The only weapon that shoots straight... So much like Smite ripping off League of Legends who ripped off Dota. This game is a huge rip off of Unreal Tournament. Some copy right laws got to be out there somewhere. Either way, games pay to win style, but you only ever need the starting gun, get the thing first, prehaps flag, then ski around the whole map either never not skiing slow or just fly the rest of it and your almost uncatchable. Its really initiative and guess work for this game. No aiming required.
7349	0	a	not very good ♥♥♥♥ graphics besides being powered by Unreal Engine 3 and 0 story
7350	0	a	Dead game thanks to the developers.
7351	0	a	The game is fun, but unfortunately is dying. End of story. I played more than 2.4 hrs (at least 100 hrs)
7352	0	a	It is very difficult to kill a target in this game, difficult cu maim . I don't like this 'glide' thing, very stresfull and unpleasend game. Planetside 2 is just so much more superior for this but my laptop cannot run it because bad optimisation.
7353	0	a	I just had to write a review before I uninstalled: This game is the dumbest f**cking game I've played in a while, and I just reinstalled CSGO. I read the article on Kotaku and thought I'd check it out, which is dumb on my part because screw Kotaku. Just another bullsh*t free-to-play that you have to spend time making an account (yay for more spam emails?), verifying this or that (which by the way, go to your redist folder [common&gt;Tribes&gt;binaries&gt;redist] and uninstall then reinstall 'InstallHirezService' because its the only way you can get this dog turd game to even get past the lauch splash page, if you even can get to that point), then finding a server that has like 2 people, and putting up with the PS1 quality graphics. Dont bother, there's better games out there, if free-to-play is your bag of crisps.
7354	0	a	Sure, the title says Tribes... but the vast landscapes, the fair gameplay, the skill &gt; who has the bigger gun, completely gone.  I played this in Beta, it had promise... it wasn't all the way Tribes yet, hoping they would fix things. It's worse, now with private servers, you'll be fighting to find a decent game more than you'll actually be fighting. It's ludacris when people can pile 7 vs 1, and they have absolutely no shame in it. Why? Because if you win, you get more points. More points = Bigger gun. Course, Hi-Rez offers the quick and dirty Pay-2-Win route as well, so you can get points faster on your extremely over balanced team.  If the game is in full release, not Beta, why am I still seeing so many updates that crash the Steam version.   Don't even get me started about the egos and aimbots...  tl;dr Tribes: Ascend... with more prideful ♥♥♥♥♥♥, cheap exploits, and all the fun sucked away.   The more you play this, the more you wished people still played Tribes 1 or 2.
7355	0	a	Its a halo rip off.  Combat is as jumpy as a free-running race.  This game is majourly hacked.  Their anti-cheat is as bad as VAC.  Its hackable with Cheat Engine.  The ONLY good part is TB doing a voice.
7356	0	a	As of OOTB update devs have killed off the last remains of what made this game great.  Game is now filled with people who do nothing but farm kills, and new players.  Only about 55 people online at any one time.  TLDR: Wait for Midair and overwatch.
7357	0	a	came back because of the new patch still sucks  give it a try, but don't expect much if anything
7358	0	a	Once a great game, ruined by developers.
7359	0	a	I used to love this game now its just crap.
7360	0	a	The game is fun, but unfortunately is dying. End of story. I played more than 2.4 hrs (at least 100 hrs)
7361	0	a	Dead game thanks to the developers.
7362	0	a	It wont even launch... Like holy ♥♥♥♥, can I just play the game? Whats that? Your programmer is a meth head whos never programmed anything before? Ok. Can i just... 'No'. Maybe if I just 'No'. How about if I 'No'. This game sucks, I wouldn't wish the ♥♥♥♥ I went through trying to get it to run on my worst enemy.
7363	0	a	I spent months of game time on this game before patch. Now th patch ruined all the class system, it tend to promote a single perfect loadout above multiple imperfects ones that were making the teamwork. I wouldnt be surprised to see only medium class perfectly balanced loadout in a few month ons ervers, as light and heavy will be too 'specialized' to compete. We'll have a nice Cs GO in the end. Game previously was wonderfull, the best shooter i've ever played. Now im hagging up. Farewell Hi rez, it was nice, but not until the end.
7364	0	a	The most played game in my steam library at the time this was posted, love it, the population is starting to dindle now, but you can still find full servers by day to play, especially if you live near and around the AMS (Amsterdam) servers, too bad it lost the devs support in favor of its new MOBA (SMITE).  It still had room for some bug stomping and balancing patches, but its still an overall fun game, and since its free you have nothing to lose in trying it yourself. If you enjoy fast gameplay, first person shooters, and CS surf maps, with Jetpacks btw, it doesn't get much better than this.   *EDIT* and then december happened, lets just say that wasn't the present i wanted.

7366	0	a	cant even log in. you get shoved in a 'login hell' and you try to make an account and it doesn't even work. you log in with your steam SUPRISE SUPRISE IT DOESN'T WORK.this might be a good game but i dont know cos i cant even log in. do yourself a favor and uninstall this crap its not worth your time
7367	0	a	Out of the blue patch ♥♥♥♥ed up the game -.-
7368	0	a	This game might be Good, but how the hell should I know because there's a huge error that won't let me start the game...
7369	0	a	The ♥♥♥♥ did you guys do to this game!?!?! It was so good. Now it is just pure ♥♥♥♥ in a bag. I'd rather killmyself than to play it again!
7370	0	a	Tribes USED to be good a few years back, then they released an update where it has forever been entirely unbalanced since!   Stealth chars/flag runners used to be able to beat a medium/heavy with a few sticky grenades, now you can barely scratch them, heavies are OVERPOWERED, aiming is no good either.   If they had never reeleased that particular update, I would recommend this game, but in it's current state it's a effin' mess!
7371	0	a	Cool game although the framerate for my pc is ♥♥♥♥ I can tackle it. But for how much I love this game    I really dont LOVE the game but i got some hours worth of entertainment   I can't recommend it. I personally found the gameplay thrilling its a fast-paced game. I just couldnt get myself to like it, sorry. Try it out if you have a few days off and youre bored out of your mind. Else, just dont.
7372	0	a	Old Review... -------------------- Amazing Game, Large learning curve but one of the best F2P games available. Fans of the original two tribes games wont be disappointed.  Update ---------- After 3 hours I got the game too run once on Windows 10 in compatibility mode. Unfortunately, when I was searching for my password (Couldn't Copy and Paste My Password) it crashed in a way that causes the video card drivers to continually crash, reload, crash, reload, crash. It essentially makes my machine so completely un-usable with monitors loosing sync, grey screens, and artifacts start showing. These crashes required a full system restart to fix.   Another time it crashed with the direct3d crash. This one will allow me to terminate the tribes app using the task manager. Unfortunately, It doesn't shut the entire app down. I can't find the app that is playing music, it shows no activity that I can see. I suspect its a flash video, but I can't find it and had to restart the whole machine.  I maybe able to get it to run long enough to play a game. But Ive had enough. I doubt they will fix this. Don't think the game was a commercial success. Was suprised to see they did update it awhile ago. People don't like the new update. I can't comment because I can't play.  Unfortunately the old positive feedback I left has got to be negative. Can't even get to the point where I see a server list so I don't know if anyone is even playing it. Sadly, Just save yourself time and play a different game.   Sorry that this brand has been mishandled so poorly. Tribes 2 would probably have been put 3nd on a list of top FPS games of all times. Tribes Ascend was a fun return to the idea of jetpacks and skiing.   Sadly it is gone.  Update 2 ------------- After uninstalling using steam, I checked my SSD drive where it installed too find that it never uninstalled. Sadly, When I attempted to use Hi-Rez's uninstall it never worked and I had to end up deleting the directory.   There is multiple issues with this. First, I set my Steam Install Directory to my HD on D Drive. Unfortunately it installs on C drive regardless. This can fill up small SSD's with games rarely used.  Second, without proper uninstall, I can not remove all the references in the registry or other installed requirements. It leaves my machine with allot of crap.  Very Sad that I ever attempted to play this game. What a waste of time.
7373	0	a	Too good to be true. Everything a fps should have and even more. Well balanced classes, all guns are balanced and a fair unlock stystem. 9/10 The gamemodes are a bit confusing the first times you play.  EDIT: Everything I said before has been made untrue. They ♥♥♥♥ed the classes, they ♥♥♥♥ed the guns, they ♥♥♥♥ed teh unlocks, they ♥♥♥♥ed the gamemodes, they properly ♥♥♥♥ed it for no reason. Hi-Rez are literally the worst developing company possibly on the planet. They murdered Global Agenda for Tribes, they murdered Tribes for Smite and i'm legitimately terrified they'll murder Smite for Paladins.  LET'S GO THROUGH THE REASONS WHY THIS IS ♥♥♥♥: 1. TRIBES WAS GREAT  Tribes was a fun high octane shooter with good classes, etc etc. Smite is one of my favorite games of all time, it's insanely fun and I'm psychoticly obsessed with it. Smite was super successful, as was Tribes. Tribes even got multiple GOTYs, and was a huge commercial and critical success. Smite didn't hit their benchmark of Tribes with the critical success, but went above anything expected for the commercial section. Paladins so far has recieved literally no hype or excitement. No-one knows anything about it, and it's been left in the ditch with things like Prey 2(pre-E3 2016) and other such games.  2. STANDARD PROBLEMS  People spent literally hundreds on Tribes, and the weaponry was expensive both in game with earned currency and bare dolla bills. What happened afterwards? After they deleted more than half of the classes, weapons, gamemodes, and 90% of the playerbase, no-one got any compensation for all the money they spent there. And that's a problem with any game like this. BUT. BUT. League of Legends has been going longer than Tribes, so how has it been going longer? Updates, the team caring about their game, and always supplying it with lotsa dolla. But tribes was huge on virtual currency, and Hi-Rez didn't put any artistic love or care into it, so they killed it and left people with all of their pixels, then deleted most of it and kept not giving a ♥♥♥♥ to finding a ♥♥♥♥ to give about these people. It's a problem with any multiplayer focused games with tons of skins etc. When it dies, the money goes with it. But CS:GO is still going cos it makes money, and people still rave about it. League Of Legends is still going because it makes money and people still rave about it. Tribes was still going and people were still raving about it, but Hi-Rez were like a zookeeper throwing a new toy to the tigers. The tigers liked their old toy better, and at most paid attention to the new toy. So instead of replacing that old toy and buying a newer one, they took the old toy, put it in front of the tigers and shot it with a shotgun, then shot 2 of the tigers as well, and put the new toy inside instead.  3. THIS WENT REALLY OFF TOPIC  This went from reasons why Hi-Rez is ♥♥♥♥ to an analogy about Tigers and shotguns.  4. HI-REZ ARE ♥♥♥♥  Basically they kill old games people like to force people into a new game, and i'm afraid they'll do for a 3rd time.  5. I JUST REALLY LIKE THESE SUBTITLES  I have no clue what this is becoming.   IN CONCLUSION:  ♥♥♥♥ Hi-Rez.
7374	0	a	I've played like, 15min, it's very very short i know but, in team deatmatch, if you don't have a grenade launcher, you cannot make any kills or you can but with lucky shots, for me, it's boring if i only need to play with a grenade launcher -_-
7375	0	a	Bad experience with a good game. Each of my friends had to spend 10-90 minutes browsing forums after the install on steam just to run the game. Knowing the game has all but been abandoned there is far too much in development content on the menu. Once in game I it was the slightly aged graphics, amazing mechanics, and a very fun playstyle.

7392	0	a	The most played game in my steam library at the time this was posted, love it, the population is starting to dindle now, but you can still find full servers by day to play, especially if you live near and around the AMS (Amsterdam) servers, too bad it lost the devs support in favor of its new MOBA (SMITE).  It still had room for some bug stomping and balancing patches, but its still an overall fun game, and since its free you have nothing to lose in trying it yourself. If you enjoy fast gameplay, first person shooters, and CS surf maps, with Jetpacks btw, it doesn't get much better than this.   *EDIT* and then december happened, lets just say that wasn't the present i wanted.
7393	0	a	Gone to ♥♥♥♥ lately. They removed all the variety and challange. No more different classes, just light, medium and heavy now. They removed turrets on peoples bases. Very low player-count. Full of bugs. NEVER remembres that you've already played the tutorial 14 times.
7394	0	a	This game got ruined after they removed the classes.
7395	0	a	Hi-Rez Studios.  Everything is said.
7396	0	a	Tribes: Descend by Lo-Rez Studios 'Smite is making more money'
7397	0	a	The game was better when you could call in orbital strikes and heavy spijnfusors one-shot lights. It's too much about switching between weapons now.

7403	0	a	It's still one of the most fun shooters I've ever played, and I still play every now and then. But, unfortunately, the game is dead. You have only 2 or 3 servers with a number of players to make the game fun. It's also very common to someone to exploit a bug on the flag and make the match impossible to win.  It was fun while it lasted.
7404	0	a	Goodnight sweet prince, you will be missed.   Tribes is an amazing game, with mechanics that are simply like no other. The gameplay is fluid, the weapons are (for the most part) skill based and super satisfying to use, and the graphics actually look great, despite being a few years old. This game is just really really good.   However....  The devs have left this game to rot, they left this amazing FPS to die for smite. I mean, I can't really blame them, smite has made a ton of money and is apparently a good title too.   There is a tiny community of hackers and salty vets, usually 5-20 players.  If this game was still cared for an populated, I would reccomend it, but it's dead and buried.
7405	0	a	How can I post a good review if the doesnt even want to launch off the ground. I keep getting 'Stopped working' popup and cant get it fixed.  Thanx HiRez but no thanx.
7406	0	a	Sadly, the game is passed its prime. There are too many similar and complete games out right now to justify pvkii. I put several hundred hours into this game; I LOVED this game, but I simply can't bring myself to get back into it. The most disappointing facet about this game is the level of support the game has gotten.  I get it, games take time, money and energy to make. It's a fact that probably doesn't get noticed nearly enough these games. The game has been out for over half a decade now and still has not managed to release half of the classes that were planned from the beginning. Each update has become more and more underwhelming as time goes on. When the game first came out, there was only one class per team. They were unbalanced and buggy, but they had personality and synergised well together. Later updates brought variety, engagement and even a complete overhauls of game mechanics. The game began a bit of a decent by the release of 2.3, which is a bit odd for me to say because i probably had the most fun during 2.3.   2.3 brought a new class, an updated engine and multiple bug fixes, but it had one flaw. 2.3 allowed player to choose between a manual and automatic block function. This may not seem like much to someone looking in from the outside, but modern game communities are finicky about the games that they've put so many hours into. Imagine, if you will, a game suck as Counter-strike 1.6 added some sort of option that reduced the amount of damage that a headshot inflicted; but, at the same time, increased how much damage a body shot would do. This would drasticly reduce the learning curve for new players, while leaving the game unaltered for the die hard veterans that have been eating and breathing this game for the past decade. You could balance the damage figures perfectly and draw all of the graphs you wanted, but the veterans are not going to like the fact that the skills they have honed have now been made slightly less effective so that some filthy pesant with a brand new copy can feel accomplished. A small change that forever alters the way that the game is seen. Manual blocking was still the default option, even preferred by some of those old pvkii vets, but auto-block gave new players an arguably unearned and uneven playing field. This seemingly insignificant change drove a spike through the community.  And this brings me to the a very taboo topic in pvkii. The 'community.' Some will tell you that the community is in ashes. Some will tell you that the community is just fine. All can agree on the same thing, the community has gotten SMALLER. I, personally, won't be going into the specifics about the sociology behind the pvkii community because i wouldn't be able to progress beyond a ramble that leads to nothing productive. Instead, I'll bring up the previously mentioned issue, the spike that drove the community apart. Modern gaming is leaning towards a sort of bipartisan: 'Core' gamers and 'Casual' gamers. 'Veterans' and 'Noobs.' 'People that play more than me' and 'People that play less than me.' '12 years olds' and '12 year olds.' The core guys bring stability to the community and the new comers bring life. Neither are perfect but both are vital. When the barely sentient guy that just installed the game manages to get a lucky hit on someone who has the pvkii logo tattooed on his forehead for so long that the ink is starting to seep into his brain and cause mood swings, two things happen. One: the new guy tells his friends, they tell their friends, who tell their friends and so on until, you got a reputable pack of these little poobrains wobbling about mashing the m1 button so hard that Razor's share holders are starting to get nervous and Two: the hardcore players lock themselves away in a single server so that they can beat each other over the head with their erect ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and talk about how good they are compared to everyone else while comparing size in peace. These two rabbles are what we have now, and what have to be appeased.  Updates after 2.3 left much to be desired. New voice overs for every class were added, leading to the reactions 'WTF I LIKE THE OLD ONES' from the vets and 'Oh cool, this game has voice acting' from the new guys. A new class was added, considered 'lame and game breaking' by some and 'easy to kill if you're not an idiot' buy others. Some old maps were taken out and put back in, leaving everyone to wonder where that balanced class was that was supposed to be added 3 patches ago. It seems nothing the poor devs can do makes anyone happy anymore for more than 2 seconds. The voices conflict each other 9 times out of ten, and it's a shame to see it all for nothing. So much love has been put into this project, that much is apparent just by booting it up and listening to the theme music. So why can't I give this game another chance? Why can't I find enjoyment in something so beautiful and unique and amazing since there's so much love smeared all over it?   A while ago, the game released a ranged class. This was the first exclusivly ranged-focused class added to the game. The devs balanced the archer by handing out arrow blocking shields like expired candy to pretty much everyone else. It took some skill and getting used to before you could manage anything with it. Naturally, as change tends to do, everyone was enraged for one reason or another. The other guys saw the utility of this archer class and the new guys hated every second that they couldn't play one. A few updates later, a NEW ranged class was added to the game. You know what they forgot? Anti-ranged classes. And i don't mean classes that have a really good chance against archers when they're right on top of them. I mean some kind of stealth unit that can sneak up behind rangers and one-shot back stab them. Something that totally obliterates archers and sharpshooters when used by a competent player. Something that makes you NOT WANT TO PLAY A RANGED CLASS. Naturally, these units would be completely destroyed by melee units and thus you achieve balance.  Now we run into the heart of the problem. We have a simple problem with a simple solution. Finish what was started, the world keeps spinning. But the problem isn't being solved. Updates have been excruciatingly slow, and depressing when they finally do get here. The most recent class, the Sharpshooter, isn't nearly as up-to-par as all of the other classes. Its another backpetalling archer with slightly more speed than you and seemingly unlimited ammunition. Without a counter class, my frustration with this game is doubled. Don't get me wrong, I like the idea of an Archer class and a Sharpshooter class and even the idea of having to find a way of dealing with them as a melee class. What i don't like is having to fight ranged classes and melee classes at the same time constantly. You've got two voices coming from the community. One says 'U GUYS IM LIKE SUPR GUD AT RANGR YOLO420SWAGSNIPERWOLFNARUTO4EVER' and 'No, it's easy. You've just got to use your shield and kite around this rock and run all the way around and wait until he's not paying attention and change classes 2 or 3 times and shoot him in the face. It's easy.' (That is, IF you can hear them over the sound of errect ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ slapping against foreheads and keyboards.) I get it, you can get around them by kiting and shielding. I've done it many times. ITS NOT FUN. I also get that you can start a fire with a stick and a rock, but that didn't stop matches from catching on. So two voices are left. Counter the rangers or don't counter the rangers. I get it, updates are in progress, these things take time blah blah blah, but the game play has been deteriorated. With a majority of the blocking mechanic has been practically removed and pure melee fighting nearly unheard of anymore, the melee combat is basic and unenjoyable. Balance it and i'll give it another try. Melee based games need fun melee combat.
7407	0	a	This isn't exactly easy for me to write, and it sure as hell isn't going to be easy for the fans to read, so I'll start by listing what I love about PVKII. Its Chivalry-like combat system is novel and sometimes quite rewarding. It has a good sense of humor and a sense of place that adds to that humor, to the point where occasionally I found myself giggling while playing.  The whole game is not only generally designed well, but looks and feels great, and it has a purity of form that you don't see often these days (rolling, kicking and certain achievements notwithstanding) - although it remains to be seen how the slow but steady updates affect this. The dedicated dev team who craft updates in their free time is yet another positive aspect. Community contributions to the game have been usually positive. At the very least, the mechanics of the game aren't stagnating somewhere they really shouldn't be. Player titles and parrot customization are both really cool. The game  can  be really fun at times.  However, after more than a hundred hours of direct play over several years, and having gotten a number of friends into the game? I started to not only become increasingly frustrated, but I started seeing problems. Problems that aren't exactly fixable by developer manhours, problems which eventually turned me off the game, and they'll more than likely keep me away until or unless the game becomes wildly more popular than it is. It won't, and that is an honest damn shame, because PVKII has had - and continues to have - real passion and work put into it.   I hate to say it, but a lot of those problems stem from the game's playerbase. The central issue is something called the  prisoner's dilemma  [en.wikipedia.org] . Since there are three teams that can all attack each other, it's possible for the two losing teams to fight each other instead of the winning team. Players often indiscriminately hunt and fight each other instead of ganging up on or even paying any attention to the winning team.  Why? It's no real fault of the devs. This is a competitive multiplayer first-person mod with a not-insignificant difficulty curve made with an engine that's 12+ years old at this point. A small community and to a lesser extent players who ignore objectives are problems for ANY competitive multiplayer game, but here the situation is especially bad: a decent chunk of this game's small community seems hellbent on being deathmatchers and killfarmers who play into either the prisoner's dilemma or the apparently unacknowledged need for there to be an official and officially supported deathmatch version of bt_island, which is the de_dust of this game. A good helping of toxic gamer culture doesn't improve things.  The problem with being decently skilled in this game is that the aforementioned decent chunk of the playerbase is still plain better than you on average, and you have a much steeper climb in front of you to hold your own against them. Teamwork is important in doing so, and it  does  happen sometimes! It's still not coordinated often due to the reasons in the above paragraph.  Meanwhile, you're usually facerolling new players so hard I'd wager a good number of them would be roughed up enough to give the game a pass. This is a problem in every game with a small community, as I mentioned before, but here it's compounded by a number of factors. If this game could grab and  sustain  a critical mass of players, this wouldn't be nearly as much of an issue, but I cannot say it has the visibility or indeed the gameplay base to do so. It is a real shame.   The achievements are both the icing on the cake and the red flag for me personally. Some of the more recent ones are ridiculous, especially going up against the usual crop of veterans, to the point where they're seemingly  tailored  for them. One of them is literally named 'Fifty Shades of Gestir', earned for using all of the Gestir's weapons to kill an opponent and unlocking the title of 'The Fetishist', which I find utterly ridiculous yet strangely representative of the toxicity present in the community. A friend of mine outright told me that 'the PVKII community has become so inbred that it's eating itself alive', and I'm sadly forced to agree!  I want to like this game, and I want to recommend it, because it can definitely be fun. Unfortunately though, PVKII just proved more frustrating than I wanted to put up with, and for reasons that seemingly cannot be fixed anytime soon. I'm sorry, folks.
7408	0	a	It's a great game,and I can't wait for more classes.I definately recommend this game and applaud the designers....  Was what I did say before 3.0.I literally played one of my favorite games for ten minutes as a non-Knight class.Got owned.Voice acting is now terrible,and the old graphics were good.I would have rated it 10/10,now 3/10.
7409	0	a	Though I enjoyed the game when I first started playing it 3 Years ago, I notice one thing that hasn't changed; the Community. Most players are decent and well and good, but there are, and yes this is true, still players using Aimbots on Archers. The Archer is already strong enough without a bot, and yes, there ARE Aimbots and Aim-Assists for Travel-Time projectile weapons, you can go ahead and spend a few minutes looking them up.  The worst part about this sad factor of the Community is; there's only a few servers left that people actually play on, and they all have active admins. Active admins that don't do anything about Hackers or Botters and instead ban and kick the people getting upset about it and calling them out, always claiming the same old ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, 'You can't aimbot a bow [Insultive Name].' And that's usually followed by 'Noob', 'Gtfo', or an outright kick/ban/mute. And if the admins don't have you banned for 'Dumbass' or something of that note, prepare to be berated and verbally annihilated by all the good friends, admirers, and fellow Hackers of the Player in suspect when you say your piece about them.  PVKII WOULD be fun, if not for the fact that the only way to HAVE ANY FUN if you aren't also using Hacks, is to find a way onto the Knights team and get Carried by Archerbots. Oh and believe me, the Ranged Combat for the Pirates? Innacurate as hell and always a gamble. You won't hit practically anything even point-blank. And Vikings throw things, enough said. Oh it's not? The Travel time on a Javelin or Axe is so slow, that people will literally just keep strafing you and you'll miss half or all of your throws.  So honest to goodness, unless you already plan to start off your PVKII experience using the latest and greatest Bot/Trainer/AimAssist, you're going to have a dumb, unfun time.  Also, if you find yourself up against an Archer who has unbelievable skills, stand in their view and rapidly alternate your Strafe Left Strafe Right keys. Notice how they'll immediately start missing almost every shot. At you, someone who is physically standing still, yet has a Hitbox swerving all over the place. You'll get what I'm talking about once you try this out.
7410	0	a	The community is awful, there are only like 4 servers and they are all full of 300 ping australians and russians, and they keep adding game mechanics to make it more slow-paced and beginner-friendly (rolling, kicking, Man At Arms' special, Sharpshooter, autoparry, countless stun and blur effects...)  Honestly this was the best sourcemod by far a few years ago, sad to see the state of the game. It's probably not worth the download unless you are going to play with friends. The devs simply don't care about the core playerbase, who have broadly opposed every major change in years - hence the fact that most of them don't play anymore.
7411	0	a	- Low Ping Easy Mode -  Knights team unbalanced  Developers unwilling to nerf archer class despite community  Regulars tend to stack a lot

7413	0	a	I liked this game up until the update where everyone goes fast. Heavy Knight should not be as fast as skirmisher was! And don't get me started on the directional attack indicators: they just clutter the hud and provide no useful information! Overall, I think this game is going downhill as a result of loss of vision. If these changes were reverted let me know in the comments section and I'll take this down.  Edit: I forgot to mention rolling, I think that's all I need to say.
7414	0	a	This game is so broken
7415	0	a	The game's colour scheme makes everything nearly IMPOSSIBLE to see, everything just blends into the same dull brown. Combat is simply pick a ranged character and run in circles, because there is no way for a melee character to catch up, this leaves ranged characters seemingly very unbalanced.  Game community seems to leave every server with a teamkilling ranger as well, great community.
7416	0	a	You see, 1242,9 hrs record since versions 1.0-2.5 (when I stopped playing, because of reasons), but 3.0 is coming today, so I'll hope it lures me back to play it once again. This game is worth of playing over 1000 hours. Problem is, that you may not like some things. Too many shiny effects, or class-related things. And this game needs seriously more players to play. PVKII needs you! Simple game mechanics and combat, easy to learn. Combat mechanics, map changes &amp; balance changes in every update to upside down, so you'll never get bored!  And this mod is totally made of bare hands of people, who make this in their free time.  Want to play like zweihänder as heavy armored knight? Legolas-styled archer with fire arrows, or sniper-crossbow? Slammer man-at-arms? Heavy hitting rage-berserker? (was my favorite, until they 'nefred' it to become runner and light-hitter and made me quit) Strong-all-ground huskarl? An annoying old man, gestir? More annoying skirmisher-pirate, with throwing explosive kegs? Kaptain with attack parrots and blunderbuss, which can shoot cannonballs? Sharpshooter...sniper?  This game doesn't take too seriously on history-relation, but it is (at least was. Maybe it is still, I haven't played since 2.5) entertaining.  Edit: so, 3.0 is here, and so stays skirmishing berserker. Too low range for two-handed axe (it is like normal sword) and low damage. Not suitable for brute-viking. That's why I give thumb down.
7417	0	a	This game was an all time favorite some 3-4 years ago. It has turned into an all time ♥♥♥♥ show with the added mechanics making the game more easy for new players to stand a chance, instead of making them actually put effort into the game to be any good at it. The toxicity is awful, there are a lack of servers and all of the top players from back in 2.3 are either dead from steam or dead from the game, except for a select 10-20 players. All in all, i would not recommend unless they bring the game back to its high skill ceiling game that it was in 2.2 or a variation of 2.3.

7421	0	a	They tried to make an improvement from the original PVK that was a HL1 Mod. But so disappointed with what we are left with.  PVK the original was much more balanced than PVKII, I would know. I played the orginal for hours and even had my own clan in it. PVKII simply is no where as good as PVK the original.
7422	0	a	Not a very well made Game, probably one of my least favorite Source Games by far. The Game is not very well balanced, and overall has good graphic appeal, but has low player count and isn't very well thought out. The Garry's Mod Content addition is the only reason you should get this game.

7432	0	a	I played this game a long time ago and came back to it, wondering why I stopped playing, and now I remember. The game is plagued with horribly unbalanced teams. Unless you're a Skirmisher, Sharpshooter, or Archer, you can expect most of your game time to be spent chasing after said enemies who can damage AS they outrun you, and they will. Maybe once in a while, you'll get a good actual fight in, but the times you spend being frustrated just overtakes it. It's fun if you can play with a bunch of friends who would abuse this imbalance, but otherwise I definately won't be coming back until this is fixed.
7433	0	a	♥♥♥♥...
7434	0	a	combat is super basic, takes 5 hits to kill someone with a giant axe, cant really combo, very sluggish. Not to mention, there are only like 4 servers and they are full of admins who drop you from the sky so you die, for no reason at all. great game with an even better community...
7435	0	a	'Short-word Review!' ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Pros! ===== -Innovative Gameplay, You have to move (your screen) in the direction of your weapon's swing to do (decent) damage.  -Fun classes, though kind of unbalanced in my opinion,  Vikings have melee and throwing weapons,  Knights have Cross Bows/Bows and swords/maces/etc., Pirates have Cutlasses/Daggers and guns. (Ranged is the better pick over melee usually.)  -Guns aren't hitscan so you have to think about drop-off.   Cons... ======  -The game is nearing death, there are only 2-4 servers that are decently populated.  -The Userbase is Toxic, from what I've seen on the 2-4 servers that are populated.  -Ranged beats out melee (usually), so Ranged classes have an advantage over Melee users.  Overall, I'd say 'No.' mostly because I do not like playing games with Toxic Userbases and that's all you will see with how small the Userbase is.  -so decent game even though kind of unbalanced but bad community, take that as you will.      
7436	0	a	After reading the many reviews, i expected this to be a good game, but it really isn't... The way it plays leads me to saying that this is nothing but a reskinned TF2 with an extra team.
7437	0	a	I come back after several years to see this mod still in an unbalanced state with new rolls, because lol why not, with a combat system that made me want to go play Chivalry more than anything else. It had its carm back when it just came out and youtubers were playing this game and just enjoying it for the first ten hours of fun one had while playing it but anyone wanting a deeper sense of gameplay or tactics will be left wanting.
7438	0	a	nobody plays this game cuz its free
7439	0	a	1/10 would rather play chivalry.  -Dead Knight
7440	0	a	Easily one of the worst fighting experiences in any multiplayer game I've ever played. Come for the interesting premise and cool looking classes, leave because you can't hit anything and the levels are more likely to kill you than another player.
7441	0	a	Positive Review: If you always wanted to play Chivalry: Medieval Warfare but never had the money to buy it, then this game is for you... its very much like Chivalry, but with Pirates and Vikings added to it, mind you there are some things this game has that Chivalry doesn't and vise versa the game is pretty well polished, maybe the hit detection is a bit off and the servers are not the greatest when it comes to ping, but the game delivers on the fun factor. As for cash shop or anything of the sorts, i didn't reall see one which in my opinion makes the game good by far. except ----v  Negative Review: As i mentioned above this, the hit detection is quite a bit off and can be quite annoying, and also there is the server problem, i picked the server that has good ping 'or so it says' and when i joined everyone has 150 - 300 ping... making it almost impossible to hit anyone.... but everyone can hit you... another problem with the servers... they are pretty much empty... now idk if it is because im US East or not, but there were only 3 games out of....50 servers? give or take 10.... 1 had 6 players, 1 had 2 and one 'which had the worst ping' had 26 players.... i tried them all, and i could hardly kill anyone, out of my 0.7 hrs of play i got 3 kills or something around that and north of 20 deaths... i know maybe i could just suck at the game...true, but my chiv record says otherwise.  personal thoughts only: I didn't mind the game, but it's not for me... I'll stick with Chiv, but don't let this have you shy away from the game, no no no... give it a try this is just my personal thoughts, if the game looks interesting to you, go ahead and download it, it doesn't cost you anything and there is no cash shop as i mentioned. who knows you might be really good and love the game.

7453	0	a	5/10 didn't find it very fun at all despite my positive bias for the genre, but I'm sure it's fun for someone out there.  You may stand to have a good time if you've never played Mount and Blade or Chivalry. It does feel as though the game was made with love, but it's still an awkward, clumsy, and unpolished combat experience. I'm easily satisfied when it comes to melee combat but this game was actually hard to enjoy. Fights are just people running around each other swinging and swinging and swinging their awkward weapons until they die. They're long and unfulfilling.  If you're using one of the weapons worth using (as in, non-ranged and not one in which you hold down the attack button to repeat the little 'chop-chop' animation), you look in a direction to choose which of your three attacks you're going to do, and there the weapon stays for as long as you hold that button. The idea is this 'charges' your attacks, which is a welcome mechanic, but all it does is slow down your attacking. There is no flow, no comboing, no way to mix it up. You have three attacks that won't ever change and they're all made for a very small hitbox. You really can't drag it around either as you can in the aforementioned games, leaving you feel less like a warrior and more like a theme park robot. And in the event you raise up a fully charged attack, know that you aren't going to kill anyone. Everyone has what is effectively a dual health bar - one for health and the other for 'armor' - and you'll be hacking at even an archer for quite a while before they die because of it. Seriously... You'll take your greataxe, walk up to an archer with a fully charged attack, bring it down on their head, and they'll just look at you like you were stupid to try it. Then they just walk away as you try to hit them the 3-4 more times it takes to kill them.  There exists a parry system like that of mount and blade, in that you must look a certain direction to ready the right parry. It's potentially nice if you have the presence of mind to use it, but in all likelihood, your opponent is going to miss that attack that you're prepared for, and most fights are just exchanges of swings. Parrying only seems worth it if you're incredibly practiced at it, and if you're using it in a duel, otherwise you just want to get out as much hitting as possible.  Everyone is appropriately mobile, at least. The base run speed is quite fast and perfect as such, and everyone has a nifty little roll they can execute, although I'm unsure of how applicable it really is in a fight. You can't roll and transition smoothly into an attack.  Are the teams balanced? I haven't played enough to say for sure, but it seems the pirates generally come out on top. In a game where hitting people to death is a tedious experience, the characters that can just shoot you as well as place powerful explosives are probably going to have an edge.
7454	0	a	no it is a ♥♥♥♥ fest
7455	0	a	5 minutes into this ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ and I get attacked from the back and front,what the ♥♥♥♥ is up with this game.This is the sequel to Fistful of Frags(♥♥♥♥),but it's free,so why the ♥♥♥♥ not!!!!!!!!!
7456	0	a	I think PVK ll is crappy, because the mechanics and the gameplay are kinda' bad and there is no sense in this game. For some people it might be fun and the different game modes may seem cool, but I really don't like it.
7457	0	a	i dont really like this game  i dont have friends with the game so i cant play  boreing
7458	0	a	Well it's free, but that's the only good thing in my opinion. It sucks. There were, for me, like 10 servers. On top of that, about two of them had a DECENT amount of players. I don't know, it just sucks.
7459	0	a	There are better games all around you could spend your time on, and the community is cancer. Go get Mount &amp; Blade.
7460	0	a	♥♥♥♥ this mod and ♥♥♥♥ the devs
7461	0	a	Pirates are severely overpowered (parrot attack must be removed and guns toned down). Vikings desperately need a decent ranged class.  Fun concept, fun gameplay, besides previously mentioned problems. Fix them, and I'd absolutely recommend this.
7462	0	a	Some characters are unbalanced.
7463	0	a	is it a joke or what ? 20/100
7464	0	a	I personally can't recommend this game. The sword fighting is a rather perimitive charge-up style, which lacks skill. You just release left click when they're near you, or block. Nothing to it. The maps are absolute GARBAGE. They have 0 skill aspect in mind, and they are simply to look cool. The only thing I find fun are the long ranged weapons. Not to mention the classes aren't very well balanced. If you want this game because you like medieval stuff, then look at Mount &amp; Blade: Bannerlord, which still has the charge up style fighting, but it takes more timing and its much more balanced and fun, and replicates the medieval aspect in a much more fun, realistic, and involving way.
7465	0	a	Just a waste of time. I mean, unless you're broke &amp; impatient, just buy chivalry during a sale. Effects are bad, pirates are OP, and random map elements just fustrates me more. All-in-all, BUY CHIVALRY YOU BROKE GIT!!!
7466	0	a	Unfortunately, the game was unplayable for me. Started it up and chose a map. The first one just got stuck on the loading screen instantly. I restarted and tried another map which loaded for 3 minutes and then got stuck for another minute before finally loading into a game, which was unplayable too because of graphics mistakes.
7467	0	a	Unbalanced -.-
7468	0	a	Don't play this game. It's not worth the money.
7469	0	a	8 minutes of total garbage , 8 minutes of pure domination from one player with a good connection, to hell with these games, deleted.
7470	0	a	Nice idea, but very unbalanced.
7471	0	a	Nothing against it, but It's too cheesy and clunky for me. Not my thing, I know better similar games.
7472	0	a	Literally, next to Chivalry, this is the worst game I have ever played in my entire life. What a joke.
7473	0	a	Ive seen cancer, this take the crown.
7474	0	a	Bad, dead, game. 200 monthly players is PATHETIC when the number was double that in 2012. Every patch makes it more newb friendly, adds more horrible particle effects to drop framerates and incread dl size. Developers threaten people who give it bad reviews or feedback LOL  Everybody who was ever good at this game abandoned it years ago, it's ♥♥♥♥  edit: at time of updating review (dec 2016) there are exactly 0 good north american servers. Don't bother installing if not european. Monthly players is down even further from oct 2015
7475	0	a	Terrible. Do not download this.
7476	0	a	Stupid game (for kids), there's only 4 servers and the ping is very high and in each server there's an annoying 10 year old kid screaming over the mic *_* while the combat is simply pick a ranged character and run in circles. &gt;&gt;&gt; this game is garbage.  It's not worth the download, don't waste your time. My rate for this game is 1/10
7477	0	a	Takes a long time to load the servers, and there aren't that many. I would rather play Zombie Panic Source, or Neo Tokyo, which are also Source mods.
7478	0	a	Games broken and unfair, full of hackers.Worst game i've ever played.
7479	0	a	WHO LET THE ASIANS OUT OH OH OH WHO LET THE MEXICANS OUT OH OH. This game 99%  Mexican and asian some portigues but this game isnt even for America anymore
7480	0	a	A decent game, kind of sucks, still one of the best free games out there. This game gets old quick, not bad at first.
7481	0	a	This game is TERRIBLE  Hit Boxes are off, weapons are unbalanced, and the game just does so much of the wrong stuff. They try and make the game realistic by making a shield brake system and faction based classes, but then they fly off the reality track and make rifles 5 shot kills and swords are 10 hits.  As far as balance goes, dudes with diamond armor and 30ft. longswords plauge the game killing everything that moves, while guys with shortswords and shields struggle to see over their shield, and when they hit, its barely even noticed.  Ultimately, my rating for this game is a 4 out of ten, painfully average. it would've been lowered to maybe a 3 had it not been for the hilarious fart trick and the somewhat attractive gunplay.
7482	0	a	Pretty useless now.
7483	0	a	The most poorly balanced team-based game I've played in a long time. If you don't like playing ranged, just don't play the game. Because when the enitre pirate team is running around with devastating ranged weapons that almost never miss their mark, you're pretty much just screwed because your sword is less accurate than their damn musket. You can swing it right at a person and it won't register four hits in a row but don't bet every ranged ♥♥♥♥er in the game won't hit you mid horizontal roll.
7484	0	a	While the game is free, unless you're experienced with moderately advanced FPS Melee combat games, I do not recommend downloading this game.  This game is updated very little at this point, and a majority of the player-base is now veterans and tryhards, along with some stoners in the mix. Unless that's your crowd, don't get this.
7485	0	a	Unbalanced piece of ♥♥♥♥. Isn´t worth downloading.
7486	0	a	Basically it's TF2 but with mount and blade's directional swordfighting system.  Overall, reflexes are more important than strategy, which makes for a bad game, since you could just play paddle pong in real life if you wanted to test reflexes. It was fine in mount and blade because mount and blade is a single player game so winning isn't as important, but here it can be extremely frustrating to go into a battle knowing you are going to lose because the opponent reacts faster than you.
7487	0	a	How to win in this game. Step 1: Download an aimbot. Step 2: Always join PIrate team. Step 3: Look for an enemy and walk backwards while they walk towards you and shoot at them. If that doesn't work, just throw a bomb and/or sic your parrot on them.
7488	0	a	Some modes were a lot of fun. There was a Halo mod where you jump back and forth between two sides that was great. Others such as an underground dungeon not so fun. The game is free so that's a plus. But it really feels like a cheap version of Chivalry. If you don't have the money for that game, then try this out for free. Low 3 out of 5 Matt faces.
7489	0	a	Pros  unistall button works well  Cons  Everything about this game
7490	0	a	ITS ANOTHER VALVE ENGINE GAME! NUUUUUUU
7491	0	a	It's like getting a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that's all teeth. Sure, yeah it's a BJ, but it hurts.
7492	0	a	My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and it destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through.' I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.
7493	0	a	I hit a man with a huge battleaxe 5 times, STILL ALIVE. He then sicks his OP parrot on me, dead instantly.

7504	0	a	Game is terrible knights way to op
7505	0	a	Played five matches, at different times of the week. All children, with the most dreadful multiplayer manners. I thoroughly enjoyed the original, and because it required a base purchase of half-life it wasn't populated by the dregs of humanity. Not the case here. The game itself hasn't strayed far from the original formula, lots of polish on the characters, while the maps are hideous and cartoony. The game modes are a great idea, I'm sure they'd be fun with the right crowd. I can't really fault the devs for the actions of their community, it wasn't any aspect of their design that turned me off from this title. I'll probably come back to check up on it. Not recommended for a solo player to drop in to. Probably great light-hearted fun killing friends.  From an active, contributing member of this game's community:  It's not even the developers fault that PNVs (Pathetic Nostalgic Veterans) miss the 'old game' You're pathetic 'in my eyes' because you're heavily comparing the original with this one.  -♥♥♥♥♥rto el Negro  Please note how previous experience with the developers' work makes you inferior in the eyes of the community.
7506	0	a	THIS SUCKS! FULL CAOS NO STRATEGY RANDOM TEAM KILLERS! (I stoped the rant...)  Basecly tf2 whit armor and swords just worse, how can poeple like it i don't see the fun. A mix of Chivalry and tf2 is not a good combo. I played it for 24 minutes and i was already cracy of hearing the What the ♥♥♥♥ and random music. Graphics are decent to be a modern game(good if you compare to tf2), but its is hilarious i give em that. The worst server finding system ever! (Same as tf2 just worse.)   3 hole units for all factions! . CLOSE COMBAT YOU CAN*T SEE ♥♥♥♥ AND IT IS 100% YOU WILL GET TEAMKILLED. 3 weapons for each units. It is so bad so hilarius that i wanna play it again.
7507	0	a	hate it
7508	0	a	This game is all around garbage. Ghetto Graphics with Ghetto players. I Regret wasting my time with this horrible game. I fell ashamed of wasting the smallest amount of space for this. DO NOT play this if you like waiting 10 mins for a game, are desperate for a game, and hate your life.
7509	0	a	game is like sniffing a line then pooping in a toilet then forgeting to flush the toilet.
7510	0	a	this game is rediculous and a total waste of time if you want a good game just pay some money and buy chivarly now about this game 1. it is 3 teams so is in a totally different age but yea ok that isent so bad 2.gameplay is bad 3. combat system is rediculous 4. blocking without a shield sucks 5.why do just knight have archers viking had archers too! and ok pirates too but they got guns so they dont need the archers so mutch 6. the most maps are stupid and small 7. its not an open world game 8.the physics is just terrible 9. the graphics? hmm not so good as the trailer 10. the combat system is not just bad it is rediculous i mean i was playing in a match and a knight was super fast for he was farting and that so is even more stupid then that is if he pass near you and you dident have full health you would die. ARE YOU FUUUUUUUUUUUU....
7511	0	a	It's free that's awesome but the pros are this I played literally ALMOST NOTHING this is why  Pros   Fun concept Good classes? I like the parrot customization  Cons At the time I give this a try was late so there was just 4 servers with players 1 was randomizer and other normal randomizer was confusing but with some decent people the other one was well fine tought not new friendly they were like F#ck off and that makes me unninstall this because a normal server is toxic  No tutorial   That all It would be good but the community kills it   (Sorry for the bad english)
7512	0	a	This game is not worth downloading. The developpers are dead, 2 years without update.
7513	0	a	Barely works. Long waiting times and lots of lag.
7514	0	a	Cancer
7515	0	a	Not bad, but the close combat is horrible.
7516	0	a	played a little bit of it and got what could be expected for a HL source game - only around 100 people playing it - only 16 servers to play on  - only 4 of those have bearly anybody playing on them and the rest are emptiy - had a guy yelling allackbar the whole time - the community is toxic as to be exspected  - hit box's dont exsist   on the flip side the game is a good idea but more of a F2P verson of chiverly medeval warfare (id reccomend that you spend some cash and actualy buy that game)  so yeah, dont bother with this game.
7517	0	a	Man this a real piece of ♥♥♥♥ xd
7518	0	a	Terrible game. Poorly optimized, unblanced game play and horrendous community. Truely ♥♥♥♥ing horrendous.
7519	0	a	This game is dead, few servers, few players.  It's fun, but it's too few players, and i don't know if devs still care about it.
7520	0	a	this game is good  so good that it crashed my computer on my first time playing it.
7521	0	a	Nope. Not worth a install
7522	0	a	this game is bad it was good back in the day but games like tf2 call of duty planetside take the cake not really worth ur time also the classes areent that good
7523	0	a	i shot some1 in the head and me and my teammates couldn't kill him
7524	0	a	This game is a big giant...meh its not bad but nothing great eather but feel free to give it a shot
7525	0	a	Pirates, Vikings, and Knights = Sucks! Played for 21 minutes and never got a kill and I got massacered.  Don't get  plz listen to me  there're MLG people in this game who will massacer you. Don't get, for me I tried to kill and never got a kill!
7526	0	a	The game is full of unbalanced characters that can run you down and two shot you, and you can't even kill them in 4 shot with ranged weapons, although your job is to aim and shoot and their job is to swing a half second charge for a gizillion dmg. You will have few hours of fun til you get frustrated with the Viking classes and leave the game.
7527	0	a	This game has a lot of potential, but it is ruined by really stupid design choices. There are classes that can backpedal faster than most other classes can run forward, movement has no acceleration so running away from a fight to get health is commonplace, weapons do wildly inconsistent damage with bad animations, I could go on... Even for the price of free, it left a bad taste in my mouth. Skip this one if you own Chivalry or even Mount&amp;Blade. This game is a joke compared to those. Looks nice though!
7528	0	a	Its a good online game but its bored. I loved it at the begining but now i don't love it anymore. 5/10
7529	0	a	bad just really bad. i wouldnt even say for poor people too play this game!
7530	0	a	Clunky as hell, hitdetection is unspeakably horrible. Not worth spending any time.
7531	0	a	If hitbox in this game was actually on a person, this would be a positive review
7532	0	a	Worst game in the world if u looking for a good pvp midevil game dont Download this one  All due respect to the creators  U Guys  Suck at making games   Wast of time and data
7533	0	a	No other game on earth represented the combat realism that PVK 2.2 had. There was simply nothing like it. This birthed a group of legends who could have insanely sophisticated battles while parrying and attacking in a way no other game could even come close.  Then one day the developers slapped all the loyal players across the face by removing the complex attack/parry system and made it 'automatic' to accomodate the new players which is fine.   But they could have at least given servers the OPTION to have a 'Hardcore' mode for the truly loyal veterans. Shame.

7538	0	a	Played as a pirate, shot some knights in the face. Then I listened to some random poorly imitating Arnold Schwarzennegger for thirty minutes.  0/10 would not play again.
7539	0	a	horrible
7540	0	a	this game has been dead since 2008, there are no servers, no players  for some game that everyone says is great, it has a player population of about 0.002%   and for the icing on the cake, this game has been in beta for the past 6 years thus reflecting the devs passion for this project which is 0%  so yeah, download it if you want but you won't find many people
7541	0	a	The second comma in the title is absolutely rediculous.
7542	0	a	While I used to like this game, and was somewhat good at it, I can no longer play it. The recent patch made a huge improvement in grafics, and added the last class of the original game to the line-up (namely the Man-at-Arms), but it also caused the game to be unplayable for those who don't have a computer made for games. Before the patch, the grafics were somewhat bad, but the game ran smooth and worked without problems. But now, the new grafics causes a lag which makes your attacks miss. If you have a older computer, or a computer not optimized for games, don't bother with this game.   I give the game before the patch 9/10 and the game after the patch 5/10.
7543	0	a	unfinished
7544	0	a	I didn't expect Ubisoft games to get any worse than this.
7545	0	a	this game sucks !! after you sword swinging and hack and slash is very laggy and annoying omg 20 minutes of the game and It's enough
7546	0	a	I ain't gonna explain much why I dislike this game, my total hours weren't worth it. The game didn't change a lot for years since my first match, the combat never was satisfying and now it's gone trashy after they did add a new class (man-at-arms). They did add quite-a-lot, they added a whole one new class and new maps most of which are rarely played or never.
7547	0	a	Sloppy coding, incompetent developed decisions, SEVERELY unbalanced class design (as the oodles and oodles and oodles of map and weapon changes over the years have tried desperately to make not AS bad, but you just can't fix something that wasn't meant to be made in the first place), over-abundance of unnecessary community splicing (I.E. giving some players access to a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ beta while ignoring the rest when in fact what was being 'beta-tested' was releasable in terms of the terrible quality the mod already had going for it anyway), and a HEARTY amount of community theft. Stealing maps from ex-devs who left years ago, but claiming it a NEW map (check the REAL author for tortuga and when it was made, you will find it was created around 6 years before it was actually released as a 'new map'), constantly desperate to take maps made by the community and make them official so the dev team can avoid doing any real work, even if said maps don't fit the theme in the slightest, or are fugly as hell and need dozens of revisions (which plenty of the official maps already get anyway which says a lot about their confidence in the first place) and to top it all off, the dev team has had a LOAD of behind-the-scenes drama with each other AND its own community. The biggest of these countless examples would probably be them giving the finger to the ORIGINAL CREATOR OF PIRATES, VIKINGS AND KNIGHTS on the goldsource engine, ultimately showing zero respect for authors of ACTUAL creativity (as is still practiced by them with their map theft and content-copying) considering the majority of everything created was based off of someone else's work, including multiple maps, biggest example obviously being bt_island.   Avoid this ♥♥♥♥ at all costs. It is garbage, and is made by the embodiment of quite the same. Anyone who has gotten cozy with this mod for longer than a year prior will know this very well, and thati s why its playerbase has died off for very very VERY good reasons.

7572	0	a	i saw how many people like this game so tryed it  my conclusion is that the devs of this game have a lot of freinds who reviewed game because its junk  -Starts Install -The game installs -Loads game -Game Loads -Sees title screen -Cringes, But continues. -Finds a random server with some people -Joins -Sees you can pick a knight, a pirate, or a viking, and each splits into 3 other classes, impressed. -Picks pirrate cause there cool and have guns ! -Spawns in and is faced with a long ewait while round ends  -round ends  -Confused, but realises its my char in front of me not in spectator mode now -Finds a knight, tries to kill -Gets 1 hit -Tries to leave - But Finds a person to shoot whos fighting another pirate -Gets pwned other pirates then continues to fight knight -Ignores ignors fact knight while fighting someone else can turn and one shot me and then continue to fight other person -Tries thinks about trying viking -CBA -Closes game -Loads up steam library -Uninstalls the crap.

7575	0	a	Absolutely garbage, not worth downloading if your pirate cats life depended on it!
7576	0	a	Holy Moses, this game is bad. Crappy animations, even crappier gameplay, jumpity, jumpity jump quake style, stuttering and bad netcode. The notion that a two-handed sword takes whole afternoon to swing is just a cherry on a top. Just like a cheap quake mod from the 90's. Do yourself a favor and grab a copy of Mount and Blade Warband - it's godlike compared to this.  2016 updated review  Yep, still sucks.   Pros - slightly better gfx, free  Cons - Primitive melee combat, horible animations, no lunges, footwork, does not resemble sword combat at all.

7589	0	a	Well, Empires is a REALLY old hl2 mod (it has like 10 years). The Game is a hybrid between FPS and RTS, it's like battlefield but with a commander(who gives the orders and build the things like Age Of empires or any other RTS).  + Has various gamemodes. + Dedicated Playerbase + Helpful Community  -the Game requied A LOT of player responsability and teamwork (mostly the command) -Learning Curve is elevated, expect to be smashed -The player base is really small(expect play this game on weekends) -This game has Frustrating and Annoying game mechanics. You can't sprint so much and the maps are REALLY big, you have to walk A LOT, Reviving and healing allies is a pain in the ♥♥♥, Driving vehicles it's just terrible.  I don't recommend this game because, I just feel that the game, even if with their 10 years it feels incomplete and Empty.
7590	0	a	Great mod, however I can't recommend trying it unless you're already familiar with it just because of how hostile many players are to new people. 
7591	0	a	This game was awsome, but the new developers ♥♥♥♥ed it up, specially the last one. There is no balancing anymore in the techtree and the tanks. The Rock-paper-scissors principle has been compleatly removed and some ridiculous stuff added, like new armor who no one researches, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t icons, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t moddels and the scouts sniperrifle has been removed, so this clas has become even more useless.  this is the only game where i would concider an downgrade to the old 2.0 version not as an downgrade, but as an upgrade.
7592	0	a	Been playing afew days now, And ive come to one concolusion. this game is good when its stacked, but its okay again but i would not recromend playing if you are not a fan of constant failure, and very little reward, Either factions has their benefits. But The Beni Empire Is way to OP in my opinion The failure rate compared to the NF = North faction is laughable, 8/10 games you will loose or looose all 10 as the North faction, alot of the problems i have come across are mostly team stacking problems and pros against Rookies, if you aren't one for stressful situations and really angry players i wouldn'r recormend it  But if you feel like trying at least bring 2-3 freinds with you , or expect alot of failures, also Beni empire Weapons can kill you so damn easily but yet using the North Faction weapons are like pea shooters compared to their weapons and ive seen 1 Beni Empire gunner, Mow down at least 6-8 people if there lucky with one mag, not to mention the normal riflemen who can gunn down at least 3-2 people at once, while our pea shooters barely hurt him.  Well the finaly choice is yours of what you think of the game good luck Have fun
7593	0	a	dont play this there is only one server alive and it is full of stupid ♥♥♥♥ its good sometimes and really bad other times
7594	0	a	Empires, a long-standing hybrid FPS/RTS Source mod with a small but dedicated developer team, would be awesome if more people played it. Sadly, that is not the case, and the few regulars left are salty as all hell. Natural Selection 2 is a similar game that's managed to do very well for itself, so if you're looking for a similar game, maybe look that up.
7595	0	a	dead classic...  Pros: - free (no microtransactions) - there is still one active server with around 50 players playing on it daily - low system requirements - you can drive vehicles...as seen from photos - it seems that owners still care about the game  Cons: - dated - active server is in USA
7596	0	a	It all depends on who you play with sometime you hit gold and you get a nice kind group. But other then that most of them from the time I played yell argue fight with eachother of the littlest of thing I.E not playing for a while and not being the best of the best sooo you encounter what you would find in cod people calling you well if you played cod online you know what I mean.
7597	0	a	+free FPS+RTS +very nice landscape/map -very few people, &lt; 5 at a time -due to very low players, it'll be just FPS...
7598	0	a	Empires a Mod for the Source Engine, a First Person Shooter, Real Time Strategy.  Pros: +Both factions have there own unique weaponry +I like the mix between the two genres, FPS and RTS.  Cons: -Close to the end of the round it becomes more vehicle based, which can get a little boring at times. -There is only one server with people on it, has ♥♥♥♥ admins especially [VIPER]_Vicki -Most players are not friendly towards new players, especially when trying to be comm, literally got screamed at because the other team managed to take over all the refinerys and prevent us from pushing up even though I had no way of getting them back  So its a fun game, when you can actually play the game without dealing with nine year old girls that don't know how to administrate properly and ban you for stupid reasons.

7600	0	a	This game, as a concept, is great. The shooting is decent enough by modern standards, the vehicle gameplay is pretty solid, the base construction isn't too bad, but the one thing that lets this game down more than anything else is the player base. Back when I started playing 6 years ago in version 2.24d, the player base was much larger, and much more active. Slowly, over time, it has shrunk to probably about 60 active players. Everytime I try to come back, it is very difficult to find a server, and even when you do, there is no point in playing on it. The community in this game is by far the most toxic and unforgiving playerbase on the internet, worse than any other game I have ever played. If you make a mistake, they will flame you, if you disagree with how to play, they will flame you. It is impossible to actually enjoy this game, because it is so full of trolls, jerks, and just generally toxic players. The game never really changes, there are probably still bugs in it which have been around for years. I love this game, I really do, I miss being able to play it, but the community is so vile, it is not worth the time or effort.
7601	0	a	Looks good. I played it for a few hours.  I was able to build a few APC's. Them spent an entire 2 games unsucsessfully trying to build APC's. bug or something I did? I have no idea. The manual mearly states the obvious. Tutorial is either bugged, or not really a tutotial. The spawn screen shows Yellow dots, not Blue/Red. Oh well. COH.
7602	0	a	No one plays it. Its a dead multiplayer game. Its dead, jim.
7603	0	a	For a free game, this game was not bad. Putting time into it is a waste though.  There are certain maps that are pretty crappy. Not going to lie, the maps are one-sided most of the time  Upon that, there is only one server. seriously, it could have a total of 2 but thats it, 8v8, not at all close to the max, and when I say there is only one server, I mean there is only one server where you can play. the other servers are very inactive, no one plays them. And sure I got a few hours. Problem is, its not being worked on anymore.  So after a few hours, I officially see just how over powered the game's units are compared to the others.
7604	0	a	this game isnt very good lmao.4 real
7605	0	a	wow. First of all, I didnt know how to play. I played a server and these scottish people where raging. Or at least they were scottish... Anyway, I had no clue what was what, and those scots where getting on my nerves cause they wouldn't stop swearing. So I said, and I quote '♥♥♥♥ yar bloody traps ya stupid lil buggers' And I got banned from that server for 'Abusiveness'. You need to have single player with bots to level up to. You also need to make F11 not to close the game. Game cycles are VERY LONG, and there are not a lot of people who play the game. Sadly this game is a NONO! Great idea, dumb gameplay and mechanics.  GO PLAY BATTLEFIELD 1942 Instead. Looks better, runs better, and is better.
7606	0	a	What a shame, can't even say it's good or bad. Loaded it up and found 1 server with 6/40 playing. What a shame, I wanted to try this and see if it was fun or not. But it's a free mod, and it's multiplayer.   Was looking for another game like Natural Selection 2. Can't seem to find one. I would play NS2 but it keeps crashing : (
7607	0	a	A great hl2 mod for listening to europeans rage over new players in various accents, which will seem silly when there's only 3 decent populated servers.
7608	0	a	it has a very low amount of players
7609	0	a	whi is not working multyplayer that new.php 
7610	0	a	  No players at all the player base is dead and there are no ai bots.
7611	0	a	This game is bad in some places and good in another,I am just a rookie and only played a few hours so take this review with a grain of salt but I'm going to list some reasons this game is good and bad at the same time.(But mostly bad)  Reasons to buythe game. If you like fps try this game out,it is like battlefield but cheaper with a bit more features from battlefield,you can be a commander and control your team or just be a soldier and fight or drive a tank.  I like the maps and how they are designed.They are open and expansive as far the eye can see or its small and compact with alot of buildings,fighting in close quarters.  Reasons to not buy the game If you are going to buy the game,im going to assume your going to be a rookie no matter what fps you play,as this is very different.If you suck at the game,the community won't be really nice to you in the servers as everybody will hate you for doing things you are not suppose to and just calling you dead weight to the team. TL;DR:The community will dissolve you like vinegar  The loadout isn't really expansive with 2 or 3 weapons for each class,sometimes just reused like the shotgun for assault and engineer .  There aren't many maps for you to play on and you it is going to be really boring after a while.  There aren't many servers and there is only one server with people on it,and it's usally only about 18-22 people  TL;DR:Not much choice,not much friendlyness,and not much people but it still works.    
7612	0	a	A game that is literally so dead they used several quotes from players instead of actual game reviewers on their main website. I still think Vicki is a ♥♥♥♥. Like, a massive ♥♥♥♥. Can't ban me here, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. 8/10 gameplay, 1/10 community. Yes I know I'm raging.
7613	0	a	It's a good game but there seems to be no one playing it which makes me give a 'Thumbs Down'
7614	0	a	Please note that this mod is completely dead, check the Steam server browser if you don't believe me.  I wouldn't recommend this just because the community (or at least whats left of it) has degraded to the point that it consists solely of autistic fartlords like PatPeter ruining the fun for everyone and driving any remaining veteran (pre-2.12) players away. If you're new expect to get banned for absolutely nothing or at least screamed at until you leave.  Great concept, but it attracted the worst people after 2.12. People like the administrators of VIPER that thought it was a good idea to ban 9mining (a crucial game mechanic that has traditionally been used as a last ditch effort to kill the enemy's command vehicle)  -some dude that started playing empires back in 1.08 and watched in disbelief as the entire community fell apart after 2.24
7615	0	a	The game itself looks   hideous
7616	0	a	Not anymore, no one plays it.
7617	0	a	This mod is American experiment to integrate cast of Napoleon Dynamite into society. Such an idiot.  This game is first person shooter game where you spend most of time running around practising vote Pedro dance or getting someone shout 'Charge! ...duh!'. Someone always try to be in charge. Dang.  Better yet just watch Napolean Dynamite with sound on mute. You can only download game if you have a white vote Pedro t-shirt. Sweet.  If you have Napolean syndrome then game is for you. Gross.
7618	0	a	played this game for 5 minutes *40 hrs on record  how? i dont know
7619	0	a	Not fun.   Pros - FPS+RTS+Driving simulator - Tactical.  - Deep research tree.   Cons - Shooting mechanics. It's like HL2, but slower and also you need to lie down for maximum accuracy. I wish it was more Counter-Strike like - Driving jeeps is first person, not convenient.  - Voices sound weird.
7620	0	a	as far as I know and as many times as I tried to play this game, it always came up with some stupid login error while connecting to the servers. Um just a half life MOD, there is no reason to play single player, adn this game what little is experienced is liek any other Half Life MOD, not worth the time to read this Review. Plain and simple. I wasted 1 minute typing this comment
7621	0	a	best feature is the uninstall button -99/10
7622	0	a	i can never find anyone on the servers
7623	0	a	It's Dead,No-One Is Playing This.I Would Actually Play This If People Were Playing It. There Are Still Servers Up,But Nobody Playing.
7624	0	a	vary small comunit cant find any games dont get
7625	0	a	would have been a good game, in 1995.
7626	0	a	I tried the Empires mod for the 1st time last night and I have to say im not impressed with it.  THE CONS: I have to launch the game through SDK 2007 because the game fails to start the ways its suppose to.  Tutoral map crashes the game the second you 1st spawn.  No intuitiveness at all.  Comm vehicles not adjacent to the 1st spawn at the start of a map. Its a grueling long run to get to it.  THE PROS: Good research complexity.  Vehicles  Fully customizable loadouts    
7627	0	a	✰
7628	0	a	there's no point to make an rts where the commander comands players. It's just dumb. They need to make a game like this where you control bots and other players control humans. that would be an action-RTS Hybrid, not this garbage!
7629	0	a	Garbage doesnt work throws errors
7630	0	a	If you are looking for another First Person Shooter, then look somewhere else. If you are you looking for something with alot more to offer, then welcome aboard. If an RTS and an FPS wed, then Empires would be their spawn. Teamwork and coordination are the secrets to victory here. Once you start to learn the layout of this game, you will be hooked for life.  Update: As someone who has put well over 6k hours into this game, as well as being an Admin on past and current servers, While this game was once a good game, and has all the ingredients to still be such, even with dated graphics, this is not the reason why I am reverting my thumbs up to stay away from this game at all costs. The community, and the development team have in their midst persons who are just plain mean, there is no other way to describe them. The overly toxic nature of these people make this game one you should stay away from. My time in this game spans well over 10 years, so I know what I am talking about.
7631	0	a	At one point this was my fav game ive ever played and then the devs got bought by kabam and kabam made this a pay to win like no other. and pretty much all the old players quit, and you can tell kabam only wants money from this. sad to see that happen to one of my use to be fav games. r.i.p Realm Of the Mad God (EDIT for those who dont really understand) ok i admit its all 100% a pay to win. its more of a pay to have fun, and make any real progress. pets to heal you, regen all your stuff, and attack for you, gotta pay to make them work. theres, backpacks,potions, item drop enhancers, very powerful items right off from the start. only way you can get any of these is with money.  NOW , i wouldnt mind, skins, colors, things like that you know? like the old days of this game.
7632	0	a	The game WAS amazing....back then.  Before when Wild-Shadow-Studios owned the game the game was made for the players. As soon as kabam took over they completly ruined the game. To explain what they ruined: Ruined Ammys making them scammys, Making UT's untradeable, so we cant make back your ingame currency and finnaly, Making it pay to win-what do i mean by pay-to-win? they have implemented the feature to get items with real money, which makes the game no fun, as newbies will completely mistake the game and over take us long time players.if you dont pay you wont win.  Over all if you think im out of my mind, im not, ive played the game for over 600 hours, Im a red star,and ive lost over 20 max stat charecters most of them where 6/8 and gave over 2000 fame. I also own a guild.  Before when Wild Shadow Studios owned it- 120/10-------------Now because of Kabam- 4/10------Because of this i do not recommend this game anymore.
7633	0	a	Used to play this back on Kongregate (I believe it was on there) and a bit when it came on Steam. Was probably the best perma-death RPG game you could find. Didn't have demanding PC requirements, cool and clean pixelated visuals, easy-to-pick up hard-to-master bullet hell-style gameplay. Overall, it was great fun and I enjoyed my time with it.  So I thought this game had died out a while ago (some time since I had played it regularly), but it turns out the game is still going strong...really strong actually. I was pretty excited and saw that this game has the VERY POSITIVE rating on Steam. As I was strolling down to read some of the top reviews, I noticed a new publisher called Kabam in the game's description area. Interesting. So I finally make it to the reviews and what I see is a bunch of negative reviews about how pay-2-win this game is after Kabam took over.  I couldn't believe it was THAT bad so I tried it out myself a few weeks ago. Downloaded it through Steam, loaded it up.....Wow. Another example of an amazing game ruined by greedy companies tainting the free-2-play model. No one wonder people are hating on free-2-play games when we got so much greedy companies these days.   But Kabam really butchered this game. Everything good requires money. Skill is irrevelant. I can't believe they actually managed to take the skill factor out of a bullet-hell game. What's the world coming to....  I.Rather.Have.Perfect.World.Own.This.....Hell.I.Rather.Have.Nexon.Own.This.Than.Kabam  Never again Kabam...never again.
7634	0	a	This game was great! and then Kabam it's gone..
7635	0	a	3 words Screw you Kabam
7636	0	a	I used to play this game a  far  long time ago, back on Kongregate. It was a good game, plenty of fun to be had, and the perma-death, while annoying, only made me more determined to do better in the future, work with my friends, and pursue a higher goal.  But that was a different time entirely; a golden age long since past.  So, around 2 years later, being a more experienced and wisened individual, I decided to check this game out again, seeing it was on Steam. I went into the reviews, and noticed...a surprising negative reaction among a bulk of the players, even ones who've spent over hundreds of hours. I thought to myself,  Well it just can't be as bad as these people say, right? People love to use hyperbole to make a point.  In my lack of judgement, I decided to play this again...  I regretted said decision.  [GETTING STARTED]  So I started up the game after a shockingly-fast install time of roughly 2 seconds. Flash games, gotta love'em. I start things up, go into my character menu, and realize that half the screen's dedicated to selling me crap. That's  not  a good sign...  I start up my one character slot, and I go through the motions of picking my first hero, a Warrior. The tutorial's straight-forward, I blitzed through fairly quickly, and reached the point where I named the account. For review sake, I'll disclose my account username in-game was DMNTDxNem.  [MY EXPERIENCE]  When I first started up my warrior, in the first server I selected, things went overall decently for me. I stuck to the beach, like the game said to, and leveled up to 3 before taking on a little deeper in the forest areas. Reaching around level 5 now, fighting against not only the enemies, but the server lag, I decide a quick respite at the Nexus was in order.  Now, from when I was playing this back on Kongregate, I used to  love  the Nexus! It was crowded pretty often, yeah, but there tended to be a lot of friendly player interaction; people helping each other, constantly working in each other's benefit to get better gear and equipment, there was always strong community there.  But on my return trip to the Nexus during this refresher playthrough, I realized the game's first critical issue:  Bots! Bots everywhere! I couldn't speak to any of the players, as few as there even were around, without bots running up and drowning us out. I cannot tell you how much I desperately wanted to kill some of these players; physically. In real life. I was that angry.  Aside from that, though, there was also the issue of the shop items. Originally, pre-dev change, the shop items, while difficult to acquire, were completely do-able, and it was rather straight-forward; you earn coins, you go to the shop, you spend coins on an item you want (and eventually die and lose, but I digress,) and you got said item. Now, shop items range from the hundreds to the thousands in coin value! And if you came back into the game with 50 coins earned, many of the shop items that were once 50 are now  51 , meaning you'd be forced to pay for one more bloody coin! Slowly, I was realizing that people's anger was rather justified.  Enough about the Nexus and the broken shop, though. I went back in, enjoyed my time fighting through enemy territory, until it appeared the server I was on had a server-wide boss battle occurring. Everyone was teleported into a dangerous, high-level world dungeon: Oryx's Castle. I, among many players, was ill-equipped for the encounter, so I ended up dying along heaps of other players, who all probably experienced the same game-breaking lag spikes that I did. Congratulations, RotMD, you, a flash game, made my high-performance gaming computer buckle onto its knees...  Second go, another warrior, and I was definitely getting the hang of things. I beat a few dungeon bosses, went into the ruins and killed a few mini-bosses strewn across the world, and grabbed some decent equipment. Things were going good, and the whole thing went just as I'd hoped. Barring the several passing exchanges I gave the bots advertising their crummy products, to which I had some choice opinions of them, I finally came across an actual, breathing player; they were running around like the flash, and when I strolled up, they told me about a dungeon where they could help me get some better equipment. Now, I'll say in advance that I read the reviews extensively, and knew there were players who got their kicks off of getting people with good characters killed. I thought to myself,  Well, my guy's crap, so he'd be wasting his time if he just wanted to off me.   How wrong I was.  First off, the dungeon he dragged me into was from some candy dude that was prancing around like the Gingerbread Man. I insisted on being the one to take him down, so a little Looney Tunes-style chase went on, me using mana potions to keep up like Lance Armstrong used drugs for the Tour De France, and finally was able to dead him to death. Me and the guy go in, and before my eyes, he vanishes through a wall...and when he returned, every enemy he could alert in the area was with him. Running as far as I could, not long, considering I used up all my mana, I was eventually shot to death by a unicorn pinata barfing rainbows. And so, at level 9, Sir Gullible II was found dead due to overdose on vibrant colors. The last words he ever heard were from his once-thought ally, typing in '#rekt' about 7 times. Fun times were had..  [GAMEPLAY]  Now, the fact the game now being a botting trollfest of epic proportions notwithstanding, it's still incredibly functional. The base game works as intended, and the system hasn't changed all that much since 2 years ago. Now, I'll admit the difficulty curve's definitely become harder to cope with, especially how the higher-tier equipment is even harder to acquire than ever before, unless you throw your wallet at the screen, but by the by, it hasn't really changed all that much. You still work with other players, you still try for the best loot, and you still fight towards the ultimate goal of taking down the Mad God.  You have your four slots, weapon, helmet, armor, and ring, and equipment is divided amongst different classes, rings being the only ones where any class can use anything they find for that slot. Each class has different advantages and disadvantages; warriors can buff allies and face-tank, wizards can do solid damage, archers can hit multiple enemies at once, they're all viable for different reasons.  Remember, of course, about the perma-death mechanic; once a character's dead, they're dead. Anything they had, if you didn't get it sorted out or saved, is gone, so it's incredibly important to manage the equipment that you find, so that the next time someone throws a death-spewing unicorn at you, you'll have plenty of equipment for the next character that hits the ground.  [SUMMARY/FINAL THOUGHTS]  In all, the game's as it's always been: you play, you die, you improve, you die again, the cycle continues. Granted, there are the more-than-occasional hacking players that either screw you out of loot, or, in my experience, send sentient pinatas to murder you with rainbows, so the cycle is a bit less off a circle, and more of a triangle, where every corner is a slap to the face. You get your first slap when you boot up the game, and you're being asked to buy crap you don't even need; you get the second slap going to the Nexus, once a sanctum for player cooperation, now a den of botting inequity and a broken economy; and the final slap, rounding this merry-go-♥♥♥♥-yourself out quite nicely, is the afore-mentioned hackers, honing their trolling skills to a weaponized level in the goal of  wanting you dead.   I could go on about how Kabam doesn't care, and how they potentially ruined a good game. But, instead, I'll give them a break, and say this: at least Road-Squared didn't get their hands on this game.
7637	0	a	Hoo, this game. Was a lot of fun for the first 60 hours...before the company got bought out by a bigger company. Apparently that company had big ideas in terms of monetizing the hell out of this fairly enjoyable free to play game. I enjoyed it back when it was catching on, but I think the game has definitely taken a turn for the worse when it got bought out. The design is more focused towards getting your money than making the game more enjoyable. When a game does that, even if I already invested 60 hours, I walk away rather than get treated like a bag of money by the game's designers and publishers.
7638	0	a	Micro-transactions became too dominant in the game's design and it's suffered greatly for it. Used to be a lot of fun, though.
7639	0	a	Before you say I have no experience with this game, I have played for a good few hundred hours on the browser version.  This game USED to be good. It really was. Back then, a company called Wildshadow owned the game. It was truly f2p, with skill and no money required.  Then, a company called Kabam took over. They changed the game into a cashgrab. Skins? Buy gold. Vaults and characters? Buy gold. 1-life weapons or keys? Buy gold. Everything is gold gold gold. Updates are rare, and even when they come they just add more items to be purchased with gold. In fact, the way they 'celebrate' holidays is by creating cheap weapon reskins for more people to buy with.. you guessed it, gold!!  You might be thinking, at least there's player interaction! No, there isn't. The game is infested with hackers, scammers, enemy draggers, spambots, etc. Kabam doesn't care at all. After all, you don't make any money from clearing away hackers, so why bother?  TL;DR: Stay away.
7640	0	a	It was really fun until Kabam ruined it.
7641	0	a	Very dissapointed.. played the game like a year ago.. bought char slots, chests &amp; leveled/geared/unlocked several chars back then.. was really fun  now I see, that the game got some updates and I was getting excited again until i logged in: All chars/bought chests+bought char slots are resetted/removed again (I'd really like to know how they can remove something I actually paid money for?) and of course all chars are resetted... all I saw was a very big pop-up about a pundle that inlcluded char slots/chests etc (kinda all the things I already bought 1 year ago already).. so yeah.. greed took over here.. stay away.. rotmg RIP..
7642	0	a	Alright. This game. I used to play it on its website, but I downloaded it on here to review it.  Realm of the Mad God used to be one of the games I played the most. However, when the company Kabam bought it, it instantly became a store. Kabam are just greedy, money grabbing rip-offs, and they are the exact reason I have stopped playing this game. The main lobby is just a store, showing off weapons, armor, pets, and other things that can only be bought with coins, which can be bought with real money, or can be earned from dieing with a decent to good character who needs good stats to actually earn the coins. Feel free to play this game, but prepare your ♥♥♥♥ for micro-transactions and updates that only benifit people who love to spend money.
7643	0	a	i love this game, i used to play it when my other game is updatig, it was fun  until Kabam ruined it
7644	0	a	this is a shop, not a game.
7645	0	a	Was great, but the developers got bought out and the new owwners ruined it, don't bother.
7646	0	a	I wouldn't blame  This Game  But It had lots of fame While it wasn't lame as it is now  So basically Kabam Ruined it
7647	0	a	Thank you Kabam for ruining this................  RIP RotMG
7648	0	a	Oh god, I remember first finding out about this game while it was being made for a competition on TIGsource. It was great fun, and I suppose it still is, but after a while of not playing it and coming back to see so many changes, It has definitely taken a turn for the worst.  The basic premise of the game is pretty much a multiplayer 'bullet hell' style game, most of the action (PvE) takes place on a randomly generated continent which is really big and possesses many diverse environments. This means that there's not a shortage of bosses and mooks to kill, and temples and castles to raid for loot. The item system is pretty easy to understand, with gear being divided on tiers, a higher tier meaning rarer and more powerful items.   Initially, you are made to choose a class and dropped off in a tutorial with only a basic weapon and a skill item. The game itself is pretty fun, and you can play for hours without it getting boring or repetitive. Here's where the game starts falling apart. Most of the action that happens later is just plain old grinding. Even for the hardest monsters getting item drops is really hard, as the item drop rate is extremely tiny.  The worst thing that's happened to this game was the developers being bought by Kabam. It has pretty much become a pay-to-win affair. Before, you could buy cosmetic items and pets with real money to support the developers. Now you can get the rarest armours and weapons with a few bucks. Like I said before, the item drop rates are ridiculous, so selling weapons and items for real money feels kind of cheap.  All in all, a good game ruined by 'freemium'. If you play it, expect to grind a lot, or pay up.
7649	0	a	Kabam killed this game as it spiraled down towards its inevitable end. RIP  EDIT 7.20.16: A new company called DECA bought the game and injected life and hope into the community. May the game be brought back to its former glory. If DECA succeeds in bringing back ROTMG, I'll change the review to positive.
7650	0	a	tl;dr The game used to be good but the new company that owns it, Kabam transformed it into a pay to win game rather than having players rely on skill.  As an experienced player of this game I cannot honestly not recomend it. Ever since Kabam took it over it has transformed the game from an awesome fantasy rogue like bullet hell, to a generic pay to win mmo. Everytime I play it I feel like it's missing a purpose, and that all I'm doing is running around with underpowered gear attempting to kill bosses, and often failing in doing so because of the way Kabam has remade the game. It is only really fun if you play it with friends, or if you play it for about 10-20 minutes, which really breaks my heart because it used to be one of my all time favorite mmo's back before I ahd a nice computer. 3/10
7651	0	a	“The key isn’t about how many users you have, said Kabam Chief Executive Kevin Chou. “It’s about how much money you are  dragons of atlantismaking.  I think that clearly states how bad the current company owning the game is doesn't it?  Welcome to shop'n'waste simulator. I'd add a year behind that sentence but i suppose it be that forever.  Don't bother downloading 
7652	0	a	Fun... one day it was. Not only has the new owner of this company, Kabam, has not only turned this game into a cold-hard pay-to-win, moreover it is extremely careless about anyone who plays this game. The game is infested by many 'hacked clients' of people dashing trough walls and using various other illegit tricks, sometimes just to take away your chances at phat loot, sometimes purposely drag huge mobs of enemies on you trying to get that character of yours killed. Let's not even mention people sitting on the most powerful enemies in the game, taking no damage at all, and calling people to teleport for interesting stuff - instead they teleport to an instadeath. another character wasted. If you would be able to look past all these downsides there is plenty of fun to be found, and i have found it, before this curtain of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t appeared. If i was to start over, i would most definately not do it.  ~CrySpyx ~~Mrunibro
7653	0	a	I used to love this game sooooo much and I used to play this game more than I played team fortress 2, but Once Kabam bought the game and turned into a piece of garbage, only caring about profit and adding the horrible 'battle for nexus' game mode (after the game got hacked) that killed EVERYONE even 6/8 and 8/8 players like me, and because the game sucked soooo much after all that, many players ended up quitting like me and giving away or selling all there items and accounts. Thats why all the servers are 10x emptier now. Nice job kabam... (note that I have little hours on the game because I played on Google Chrome, not steam).
7654	0	a	I'm going to be honest.. This game is pretty great don't get me wrong. But honestly it's not worth it.. If you understand what i mean, this game is just getting worse and worse and time goes by Kabam is just shredding this game. The community has gone to trash. It's so bad that there is more hackers than legit players, and Kabam fears losing money like a prositute fears a STI screening. ( Like i said don't get me wrong there is lots of fun to be made playing this game ) but it's just not worth it.   -So many disappointing updates -So many hackers -So many Microtransactions .......Bust most of all so many good memories.
7655	0	a	this used to be good ♥♥♥♥ kabam
7656	0	a	RotMG is a game where your credit card is the best weapon.
7657	0	a	Realm of the Mad God, one of the most addictive 2D MMORPG I've played. I've got 3 years of this game on my belt so I'd like to think I know the pro's and con's.  The game publisher, Kabam. Money fiends. They take advantage of permanent death. Having the game focused around the age group of little kids and their parents credit card details. With $20 USD you can purchase 2600 gold coins for in game. However these coins majority of the time will not last more than 2 days if not 1. If you wanted the best items from the beginning of the game (Yes you can buy the best 'tradable' items right away!) for a warrior for example, that'd cost 2360 gold. Once you have purchased anything you are more than likely going to die due to a lagspike.  Through my 3 years of playing Realm I've had my fair share of seeing the occasional hacker, however occasional is a bit of an understatement. After contacting Kabam staff multiple times about hackers, I was told to video my gameplay. Staff replied with and I quote, 'Thank you for writing in with your concern. Do you have any video of these Players? If so, please send it my way. As for reporting Players, this is the best way to do it; just get some video of them violating ToS and send it our way!' - Synistrr.   Take time from our gameplay to catch hackers? That isn't our job, we are not employed by Kabam.  All in all, Realm of the Mad God is definitely a pay to win game, or hack to win.
7658	0	a	This game used to be the bees knees. Everyday playing for hours on end back on kongregate. Epic boss battles, friends, and lots of skill. If you saw someone with awesome stuff, you know they had been through some serious crap.  Now I'd rather have beens on my knees then play this game. I refuse to even touch this, much less play it for hours. Laggy servers, bad community, and pay2win. If you saw someone with awesome stuff, you know they spent real world money and did nothing to earn it.  This is the ultimate case of a game being sold to a greedy company, that ruins it completely.  RIP RotMG
7659	0	a	Game is decent, unfortunately updates consistantly wipe progress, so expect that. Publishers are known to not give people microtransaction refunds after a character wipe.  -- (Dec 2015 Edit: Not sure if wipes still happen, however I'm technically locked out of my account and support has stopped responding to me, so for Steam users that never migrated to an email like me, our items are officially locked out, paid or not) --  Every time there has been a character wipe, they say they will correct it next time, but they never do and it's been this way for years. It's come to the point that people just accept it and most people don't even complain about it anymore. Unfortunately it's not something you will see listed on the store page or in their microtransaction shop.  Recently there is a new issue with this game. Some steam users that didn't link their account to an email are no longer allowed to access their RotMG account. I happen to be one of these users, yet another slap in the face. As far as I know this only is affecting steam users and those affected have no way to play the game through their steam account, they can't even start over.  If you are absolutely certain you won't be spending a dime on this game, it might be worth a try if you like dungeon crawlers, it's about as good as dungeonland but with worse graphics. Otherwise stay away, spending cash for temporary items is no fun, losing all your hard work is even less fun still.  ''''Steam account can't connect - 02072900  Thank you for contacting us. Unfortunately, this case has been closed.  If your problem has not been resolved, please submit a new case and we will reply as soon as we can.''''

7660	0	a	I played the browser version of this a lot. It was plenty fun, grinding pots with friends, maxing a char, dying, crying, vowing not to be overconfident again, then repeat. It would still be fun right now if Kabam actually puts their effort into balancing the classes and dungeons and all that, but noooo they only care about their sweet money. We haven't seen an update for months, and the game is overrun by hackers and bots. I wish I can see your glorious days again, my dear RotMG..
7661	0	a	I used to love this game, I played it everyday with my clan but then came the update that ruined the game. They turned the game into pay to win and then I just gave up on the game because you would have to spend hundreds of $ or £ or whatever your currency is just to have more fun in the game and when you bought the upgrades, most of them were terrible.
7662	0	a	This game was fun when it first came out, if you saw someone with good stuff, you know they had been through a lot of time and effort to get that stuff, now you just need a credit card. And the servers, so laggy and always full.  Back in the GOOD days of ROTMG it was a game where me and some friends could play it and enjoy it, no lag, no buying items, no bots, no annoying, selfish devs and the producers didn't only care about their income. I miss it.  Screw You Kabam, royaly and dearly,  Screw. You.
7663	0	a	It's pay to win. If you put real money into a character and it dies, you lose everything, due to perma-death.
7664	0	a	To quote a friend, 'I just get mad at that game. Everything costs money.' Basically, I came for the bullet hell action and left due to the absurd amount of money the developer wants to weasel out of you to keep you entertained for more than 10 minutes at a time. $60 for a 'starter pack' that contains barely anything? GTFO.
7665	0	a	Oh wow! They gave me 50 of the Premium Currency lets go buy something! But the minimum price is 51 Which is ridiculous why not give us nothing and make it 1?
7666	0	a	I got mugged last week on my way home from work. My attacker was less insistant about handing over my money than this game is.
7667	0	a	ive been playing this game since early 2010 back when kabam hadent ♥♥♥♥ed everything up and made the game horrible. i rate this game 9/10- back then 3/10- now.
7668	0	a	The Older version was better....
7669	0	a	It was a good game then all of a sudden, KABAM... No literally.
7670	0	a	I've been playing this game for years (even if not through Steam), and I can say that, through time, it has evolved to provide many unique and exciting features: - Severe game balancing issues! Land tons of damage with one class and steal loot from other poor useless players! - No serious updates in years! You can play the same dungeons again, and again and again! And then some more!  - Rampant cheating! And if this doesn't still sell this to you, also know that the company now managing the game, the infamous Kabam, totally ignores cheater reports! - Poisonous community! Scammers? We got those! Leechers? Of course, the game actually encourages leeching! Racial and homophobic insults? Goes without saying! - Pay to win!!! You think you can max your pet without spending real money? Think again!!! And if you don't feel like buying game gold, just check out the black market spambots that make the game chat window completely unusable! - Much, much more!
7671	0	a	I played this game when it was a browser game back in the days and damn what a good game. Thanks Kabam.
7672	0	a	Realm of the Mad God is a top down free to play MMO mouse aim shooter with a simple art style. It has been around for a few years as a Flash game. You start the game easy enough, by selecting from unlocked classes such as rogue, warrior, priest, archer and so on. Each class plays the same, you fire projectiles. Have a sword? You shoot projectiles. The only difference between the classes are the stats and the equipment they can use. You can unlock more classes when you reach certain levels with the base classes. Each enemy gives you some minimal experience and leveling up will only improve your stats. There are no new spells and no choice of improvement. It all feels very dull and too simple for a MMO.  The controls are like every other mouse aim shooter, arrows to move with mouse aim and click to shoot. You have a special ability and potions too, but for the most part you can just use your normal attacks. Speaking of the mouse aim, it feels very inaccurate. I can stand still, fire the projectile and the projectile will miss even when I shouldn't. Maybe there is an accuracy stat or something. It feels odd when enemies very accurate. Luckily you are quick enough to dodge projectiles. Again, maybe its a stat and I need to have better gear, but there is nothing on the equipment that shows accuracy, just range and attack power.  There are a lot of enemies, each with different stats and attack patterns. For the most part they have enemies simply shoot at you. Most have single shots, others have double and triple spreading shots. Still some fire a sort of 360 degree bullet shield preventing anything from getting close. The bosses aren't that different from normal enemies. They just have larger sprites with other creatures swarmed around them.  There are quests in the game, but I mean that in the vaguest sense of the word. All quests seem to be kill the big monster. No one tells you to. You just do it. The game points out the direction of the big monster when you enter the location.  The maps feel a bit jumbled randomly with trees and foliage with a path drawn through the map. It just feels like lazy or quick map design and not 'randomly generated.' Some enemies will drop portals to different areas which is a fun feature, but since the areas look just thrown together its always just another randomly thrown together area. You have a mini map that will reveal more as you explore, but if you leave an area and return, you need to explore it again to show it on your mini map. At any time out in the wilderness, you can instantly warp back to the town / nexus with the click of a button.   The locations might look like a jumbled mess, but the town / nexus looks great, but its all just a big store to sell you stuff. All of the stores have items visibly showing you everything so you need to walk over them instead of having an easy to use menu. Another problem is to see the stats of the item you need to hover your mouse over the 'buy it' button. Don't accidentally click that button though. You cannot sell equipment, so you're forced to drop it or trade it with other players, but for the most part the equipment feels useless when enemies drop it all. Plus players are kind enough to just give stuff for free since everything is so abundant.  Normal games would have you kill enemies for gold, but in Realm of the Mad God, you need to buy gold with real money of course. Everything is right there in town / nexus for you to buy after a brief tutorial area. What do you buy with gold? Name changes, more characters, armor, weapons, rings, boxes with random items, keys, pets, extra storage, building materials and everything. Did I mention that when you die you lose all progress and items? So if you spend real life money into a free game and you die, you've just lost everything. Do you need gold to have fun? No. The town / nexus has plenty of people selling gold via their website for real money and it floods the chat for some servers drowning out any real discussion.  This feels like a really dull game that is out for your money. Not just that, but it seems hastily thrown together. The quick simple art style, the slow grind for experience, the awful map design, no real quests, the laggy input, and the inaccurate aiming, all makes me not want to be in the game let alone buy anything in the game with real money.
7673	0	a	you cant realy do anything without paying a bunch of money to buy things... not a good game
7674	0	a	Hours of grinding , days of farming , weeks of potting , months trying to get the gear and pots , finally got my maxed 8/8 character. Died due to a lag spike FML 11/10 would do all this again  UPDATE ♥♥♥♥. Kabam
7675	0	a	It's pretty sad to see such an awesome game go from free 2 play to pay 2 win. It costs 10 dollars just to change your character's name. If you can not stop yourself from buying game items that are good your character then DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME. Otherwise you may have decent fun.
7676	0	a	  Edit 25/06/2016: KABAM sold this game to a small indie company - They might bring new life into the game agian / If so ignore this review :)   Realm of the Mad God is a massively co-op action RPG created with an overused generic pixel art.   The game was decent at first, and i have put alot of hours and money into this game, but... It's all pay to win now.   It really seems fun when you start, but then you realize that the only reliable way to get good items is to pay Kabam or use 100 hours on a charecter trying to make it 6/8 and endning up dying because of server lag. You will last a few lives until you ragequit because of the completely unique yet really annoying perma-death mechanic, which only enforces the motivation to pay. Ofcause you can manage to play the game without paying anything and have fun, but it will seriously take you 300years to manage to get as far as someone who just put in 50$ on the game.   Don't waste your time or $ on this game, its a dying game and havnt been updated for a long time and probably wont get any updates in the near future.
7677	0	a	I can't even play anymore! It's broken in three ways: when I try to play as an existing character, it gives a sign in box that won't work at all, when I try to delete that character, it won't delete, and when I try to connect the account, it won't work when I type in a login! Unless Kabam fixes or deletes my old account, I cannot play ROTMG at all.
7678	0	a	Used to be an amazing exciting perma-death game, now its changed so much. I personally don't like it but I used to.
7679	0	a	fun, but some may not like the in game purchases 
7680	0	a	Seriously, Kabam? You just HAD to ruin an already perfect game. I get that paying to get certain perks helps out the devs, but don't make it so that you have to pay to advance. Screw you Kabam.
7681	0	a	It used to be a fun/addicting game, but it Kabaam (the company that bought out the game) is all about stuffing money into their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ fat bloody pockets. It was so much more fun with non soulbounded items, no insanely high tier items in the store, and no stupid pets.    ----EDIT---- Updated Review as of 5/9/16 12:53 AM  So I decided to go ahead and play the game once again since I flew back home for my 1.5 weeklong summer vacation after college.   TL;DR:  The game is fun, but holy sh*t, the gold spammers got worse and there are minimal amounts of effort to update the game. So yeah, it's fun, go ahead and play it for a bit if your internet doesnt' suck. However, I still can't recommend this game because Kabaam continues to demonstrate a classic example of a company that buys out another company, providing a minimal amount of effort to make any improvements to the game (because, 'why make improvements when you can do nothing at all and still make money off of the 12 year olds that fall for this pay2win scheme?').  ------------------------------------------------------------------  The game has gone through a laughably minimal amount of updates since I had last played this game, over a year ago. For a 2D MMO with a lot of potential for interesting, frequent updates, I thought that perhaps some unique new gamemodes, some cool improvements to the hub world, and new classes would be released.    Did I see  any  of those changes in the game:   no, not really     What I discovered in my +25 hours of playing (while on vacation): 
7682	0	a	Thanks Kabam, for ruining the game.
7683	0	a	This game has lost it's charm over the years and I wish it had it's charm but it's gone downhill now so far so that I can't even register, sign in, and even ♥♥♥♥ing so far as ♥♥♥♥ing unplayable sure I can play on the browser but what about my characters I leveled up and actually wasted ♥♥♥♥ on when it was good? If it could have its old charm and actually allow me to play then mabye just maybe i'll change my mind but now its not the game that it used to be. Not many servers are populated then it used to be (without hackers and actual players that used to play). This game has aged and now it's gone. It's time to move on and find new games.
7684	0	a	Yep It was fun backthen when  Wild-Shadow-Studios Own the game and then kabam token over and ruined the game so now you have to buy everything like (coins, ect)
7685	0	a	This used to be a great little free game to play in your browser, until it got bought by a different company that completely ruined the game and turned in pay-2-win. It used to be that the game was free but offered cosmetic changes for cash, now you actually buy gear and items that affect gameplay with cash.
7686	0	a	bad game dead developers  real playtime is atleast 1300 hours, as i played on flash projector.
7687	0	a	Pay to.......I'd say win but you don't even get that, pay for pixels with no relevance!!!
7688	0	a	I have 400 hours on the browser version as well. fk kabam and pets gg wp
7689	0	a	I've played this game since the beginning. You won't see that on my profile, because I played on the browser, until I recently went to check it out again. Big mistake.   All this game does is ♥♥♥♥ me off anymore, and not because I die over and over, that's part of the fun. What pisses me off is seeing a game I used to love being ruined and turned pay-to-win by Kabam. Kabam has done nothing but ♥♥♥♥ this game over completely since they bought it out. It's focused on how much money you can dump in the game, rather than how good you are, and how much time and effort you put in to FINDING your gear.   You used to have to hunt forever to get a good set, now you can just slap a few bucks down, and walk out of the nexus like hot ♥♥♥♥. Not to mention how they completely screwed the loot system. Not only did they add ninja, which would be a good idea, if it weren't for the fact that they added a new weapon type, instead of using one of the ones already in the game, but I swear they also lowered the drop rate on gear.   For those who don't know about the game, the ninja's unique weapon means that about 75% of weapons that drop are completely useless. Before ninjas were in the game, 66% couldn't be used by your class. This is because ninja weapons drop as commonly as the other 4 types, even though the other 4 have 2-3 classes using them.  As for the lower drop rate, I can only assume that's so that they can sell more gear to people.  I really wish I could still like this game. I used to play all the time, and I had 3 8/8 characters, full tops/UT, including alt weapons and abilities, and tons of ♥♥♥♥ in my vault. The sad thing is that I can't in good conscience tell anyone to play this game, because it's evolved into what I can only describe as a Facebook game.  Please, Kabam, I know you must have a heart. Please give control back to WildShadowStudios, they knew how to run this game better than you guys ever will. You are ruining what used to be my favorite game.
7690	0	a	Since Kabam bought this game it has been ♥♥♥♥. Wouldn't recommend for anyone.
7691	0	a	Completely different from when I started playing it. Used to be you unlocked new classes and saved your lvl 20 loot by actually being good. Community has always been heartless but at least the game used to be fun. Avoid like the plague.
7692	0	a	This game was fun, emphasis on was. I played it back when it was good but after it got sold out it became this big money machine designed to suck your wallet dry of paypals.Not to mention the only way to enjoy this game after you hit lvl 20 is to get high tier gear which is pretty difficult to do when you die easily without the gear and you lose all your stuff upon death, thus you have to use real money to buy items.
7693	0	a	Rip Wildshadow. Rip my chars. Rip obamacare. Rip my fun
7694	0	a	You either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself be bought by Kabam.
7695	0	a	I still play it, but it was good, until they made it Pay to win...
7696	0	a	Let's Just Say...This used to be good.
7697	0	a	Pretty good for uninstalling.
7698	0	a	My bank only transfers money from your savings into your checking account during bank hours which is apparently not on weekends and I haven't eaten since Friday afternoon and its god damn horseshít
7699	0	a	Used to be a great game, now a sh*ty pay-to-win with microtransactions everywhere.
7700	0	a	Don't waste your time, any fun this game had months prior to coming on steam was very methodically removed by the devs. The very over inflated cash shop prices help drive the point home that this will never become anything awesome either, just a vessel for cash scam.  The original concept of the game was a simplistic fun game that allowed large groups of people to collaborate into an army to eventually topple the mad god. People would band together in very large groups to help level each other and take down bosses. A fun concept but due to the simplistic nature of the game, hardly something you want to dole out money for, especially considering the game is built largely from graphics that are open source. Cash shop perks however created the rise of the 'cashing loner' who could do alone what 50 or so players could accomplish. That also created these loners to corner anyone getting good equipment, creating a large rift in the player base, this essentially leads to 3 options in the game: 1) hack your way to the gear. 2) be forced to cash. 3) spend ages fighting for any progression.  Now these 3 routes are actually pretty typical of a free to play. Except Mad god has one more aspect that makes the taste even more sour, permadeath. Again with original concept of the game, permadeath wasn't so bad. The game was very pick up and play again, you didn't mind starting over because you never really had a lot of content to chew through so you never got too invested into any one character and there was other classes to try the game over from a new perspective. Now there is a lot more content to the game so dying for a free player even if they do as much planning as humanly possible, is a major setback, cash players can buy additional storage and even have soul bound items so they aren't exactly starting over every single time, adding to the gap between the players.  In all this game was a fun concept that was bled dry for every cent they could get and it shows plain as day.
7701	0	a	Saying this game is free is like saying pay-to-win is fun. 2/10
7702	0	a	it was good until kabam came and ruled realm of the mad god, dying is annoying, maxing takes forever but getting those white bags was good. overall i'd rate it 2.5/10 i highly advice you play something instead
7703	0	a	You have to pay to win, it's repetitive, there's no plot, and you're not awarded anything for leveling up. Don't play this.
7704	0	a	Just like most other posts say. This game became pay to win like no other, after kabam took over.
7705	0	a	It's a top-down Bullet Hell MMO, What do you expect? The same damn song loops over and over and over again and never stops. If you die, it's permadeath, all of your loot and levels are gone unless you stored them. You can teleport to other players which 9 times out of 10 leads to your instant demise. And there's pointless microtransactions, you can buy new skins for your character, but like everything else you lose them if you die, making them completely worthless. If they fixed any of this since the last time i played, good for them, but i'm never going to play again. As a side note, no matter what class you pick and what weapon they use, they always shoot. Got a sword? it shoots bullets. Dagger? bullets. Book? bullets.
7706	0	a	Pretty clear cash-grab now. Selling power items in a permadeath game for real money is a poor move. Not really worth getting involved. Looked fun, but losing real cash permanently is just terrible.
7707	0	a	Hasn't been any major updates in over a year. Kabam only seems to care about money. If you want to play Realm without the pay to win the original is plagued with try Nillys Realm. (a private server with more content and no P2W)
7708	0	a	This game, being one of the available free to play games on the market, looks nice on the outside as it looks like an 8bit MMORPG, but as it turns out, it's much worse than that.  You start with 40 Gold, which basically means you can't do or buy anything useful. There are a lot of fancy upgrades available to the player but you need to pay for them in U$D.  It's an open world adventure game like Everquest where you explore places and complete quests, but no one tells you what to do or the goal of the game.  You have one of 20 choices of characters to choose from, which is only available without paying. My guess is that its main goal is to survive as long as you can. but the enemies' AI system is just horrible. In the tutorial part you are then asked to defeat enemies with godlike aimbot skills. If you die, you start all over again, with a new character.  The music in this game is the very same music you hear from the beginning, and it just goes on and on like a loopbox.  The chat box is full of spam messages telling you to buy Gold in order to get fance deals.  My suggestions: This game needs more detailed instructions as to how the game should be played.  My rating: 2/10
7709	0	a	All the spammers and constant 'reminders' of to buy in-game currency ruin this game. RIP Glory days.
7710	0	a	This game was great! and then Kabam it's gone.. Yeah I Stole this, but it is so true. You guys really screwed up this game!
7711	0	a	This game used to be really fun and challenging, but then the in-game transactions and Kabam ruined it. I rest my case.
7712	0	a	To sum this game (me in a skype call); Guys i think i'm actually doing well. I'm finally able to solo this abyss and get some decent loot without putting money into it! *server lags, gets stuck into wall and gets gang banged by 6 demons, then dies and loses absolutely everything*  To be more detailed, this game is fun if you survive the constant server lag and other stupid bugs. Other wise your ♥♥♥♥♥ against a wall by demons. Also, the community is almost ♥♥♥♥. It's full of children (yes this is basically a childs game) who cry to their mommy to put money into it otherwise they'll cut themselves for having a unfair life. I have picked a few out of it who are nice people and want to dungeon, but the game itself makes it impossible to give a good dungeon experience, unless you somehow manage to what the community calls '8/8' which is basically playing non-stop until you finally achieve being a god yourself. But halfway through this you'll probably die from a wall. Even then, you've gone through the hell of having to rely off yourself since this games mostly Solo until your the best of the best (without dying by a wall halfway to 8/8) you basically will be put in a guild with either children or adults who have also gone through the hell of ROTMG. So this game is addicting and a waste of time unless your like me and have nothing better to do but die by a damn wall. Also, if you have something for stronghold kingdoms, strongholds and this game share the 'Dying is apart of the game' concept. So if your reading this and are getting ready to install, you'll regret it. -----------------------------------------------EDITED--------------------------------------------------------------------------- So realm is the same after playing again for 3 more weeks, but i finally got a 6/8. What i found more disturbing is the community. Either kids who still say noob just to go jerk for the first time, or grown men who spend money on the game because why not. The real challenge realm has, is trying to ignore the community even though alot of the game is in the trade system, which btw is always changing and full of scammers.I think I'm officially done, leaving my character as a cruddy priest who actually has some decent gear, but even then, a garry's mod rp server has a better community than this game. RIP realm of the mad god, 2012-Steam
7713	0	a	This game used to be fun until i realized how bad the player base is, everyone is just aweful, they are all terrible people and i have lost 4 tombs due to the fact that people are scamming like no other and its not even fun anymore.
7714	0	a	I used to play this on kongregate a few years ago when in-game purchases werent even needed for every thing good unlike now where it costs for the crappiests gear is important to save for when you achieve level 20 from 5 hours of farming in the lowly spawning areas.
7715	0	a	game loaded at 100% and stopped, nothing else to do ..
7716	0	a	a once good game now plagued by questionable developer decisions, p2w aspects, and becoming stale.

7719	0	a	Perma deaths suck w/e takes awhile to actualy get good and farm glands ect love this game but i have to give it a bad review because i love it but its annoying as ♥♥♥♥. 4/10 not cod-Bob It's a game. 10/10-ign
7720	0	a	I've played since 2012 so I believe I have some legit grounds to review this game. In a nutshell it went from skill to pay to win real quick and now it's ♥♥♥♥. Hopefully the new devs from DECA can help.
7721	0	a	This was an amazing game. Had lots of fun. I played over 200 hours of it with my friends (Browser version) and played it a bit on Steam.  Problem is, this WAS an amazing game. Since Kabam bought it, it had turned from F2P to P2W. And is now unplayable without putting any money into it.  R.I.P RoTMG
7722	0	a	Overview:Pay-to-win, not fun w/out paying, **** the company who made it this way, could be good otherwise   To store stuff permanetly you have to use real money. Better gear? Real money. Customization? Real money. You can't farm or grind because the one chest you get to store stuff in is only 6 slots or so. There is no way to get in-game currency without paying, so without using alt accounts as chests, there is no way you can actually have fun with this game, especially if you don't want to bother signing in your alt everytime you need a different weapon. If you want to spend money on this game, then it might be more agreeable to you, to everyone else who at least wants SOME chance at getting better than slightly worse than horrible, don't play this game.
7723	0	a	Game was good, Kabam took over, Pay to win as F***, Dead game.  Sold to DECA, game revived, 10/10 good game
7724	0	a	Before you question my sanity: Yes, I have played this for almost 200 hours, as of writing this review. And I do not reccomend it. Why?  Well...  Realm of the Mad God is obviously a very addicting and fun game, but not for the faint of heart. Basically everything you do in this game is pointless, as eventually you'll die. It's like all the game is about is preparing for other versions of yourself. Which also will be preparing for OTHER versions of yourself.  I never really feel like I make progress in the game. And in fact, I don't. Nobody does. Sure, there are new classes to unlock and get better at but it never comes to a conclusion. The only permanent items you can get are basically skins, and because of this the MMO feeling of 'Hell yeah I got a rare item and it's mine forever!' getting destroyed, the game becomes boring as hell.  Combining an MMO with a roguelike, and adding Bullet Hell to that DOES make this game hell of adrenaline rush, but eventually you start to see all the flaws of the concept. They don't fit together at all.  Because of all of this, I simply can not reccomend this game. You'll think it's fun at first, but eventually it gets repetitive and boring. Despite all of this, I am probably gonna continue to play anyway. Because it's SO FRICKIN ADDICTIVE.  (EDIT: Also, I should mention this game is pay to win. INCREDIBLY pay to win. Simple things, such as creating another character slot or buying storage space even costs real money. Not to mention, the 'Gold' Currency, which is what you buy with money, can ONLY be achieved by purcashing it. Yep.)  TL;DR: Nothing is permanent, you can't make progress Overall Grade(s): At a point when you feel like the game is fun: 8/10 At a point when you feel like the game is boring as heck: 1/10
7725	0	a	Review from a White star if it matters to anyone :P  -Quit for a couple months now-  So okay I have 1000+ hours on it on steam alone and afterwards, went to adobe flash projector for a couple hundred hours, so hopefully this review will help many of you decide whether or not you will like this game. This game is permadeath, when you die you lose all your items, equipped/anything in inventory aswell.  Game is very hard to pick up, consider looking up guides on YouTube or steam workshop for reference.  Pros: Gameplay is extremely addictive!  Dying isnt so bad and you 'usually' learn from your mistakes! (atleast I do) If losing all your 'Precious' items will be too much for your heart to bear, this is not the game for you. (Permadeath) All of the classes are worth playing, maybe except for a few.  As for the community, its up and down. Mostly filled with children. Rare to see anyone over the age 18, so you can imagine what the chat is like. Not saying the community is bad, people will sometimes help you out, and you can make friends via guild system. But most guilds will only invite you if you are actually good at the game, which is cruel, but w.e. Getting loot is so satisfying, especially those yummy white bags.  Cons: Event notifier Amount of bots (inevitable in a f2p game, but bearable with the new feature that can auto- hide the chat from low ranked players)  I always have a my chat filtered so I only see ranked 10stars or above basically since I hate seeing my chat flooded from either children talking/spamming, or trolls.  I don't know if this is still out there but there was this thing that was out that would notify you via realm if there is a special quest of your interest that spawned in. This-was-the-breaking point for me... The times where I would be chilling in my home realm and see (Sphinx/Hermit) I'd be so hyped, nowadays when the event spews out 'A sphinx entered the realm' atleast 60 people from from other servers drop in to get the chance to get some awesome loot.  So onto the hate for the company Kabam...They started up pets which helped alot of new players, but made veteren players very upset. It was a new system that tries to get you to spend your real money on 'feed' to feed your pets to make them heal you more or make other abilities better. If you have the bank account, you can make this game so easy, that the only way you die is by being extremely dumb, or getting armor broken, or doing very very hard dungeons.  Now I do understand the company has to make money to keep the game running so im not upset about what Kabam is doing. There are packs they release that are understandable and pretty tempting to purchase but of course you dont have to. Now If you understand how the game works this game can be played without using your precious money but the most tempting deals would be chests/character slots. Everything else can be avoided, unless you are really bad and need to get the best items to be able to play the game. (I exploit this and load up on pots to buy top items from kids who use parents credit cards to buy items)  IN MY HONEST OPINION, Kabam is not a bad company...they need to make money somehow right? If they weren't releasing these items/keys/deals how would this game still be alive?  Overall this game is for me was great when it didn't have the event notifiers, but since they are out, the game has been getting worse and worse.   There are probably many more cons than the ones I listed but those are the two main ones that upset me. Rate: 5/10  Anyone with questions can ask here, im open to all feedback good/bad.
7726	0	a	♥♥♥♥ this game.
7727	0	a	This is a Pay To Lose game. Never even think to click that download button. I warned you.
7728	0	a	Although the Game is awesome, steam launcher of this game is so bugged, that i can't even log in. I recommend to play this game at:  'http://www.realmofthemadgod.com' . Steam makes this game unable to play.
7729	0	a	This game WAS good. Then the Kabam nation attacked. They made it severely Pay To Win. When Wild Shadow owned it and oversaw the game, it was great, there was almost no pay to win elements in the game. Now, it is almost like an IOS game that is freemium. Sure, skill is still involved, but you HAVE TO PAY $$$$ to be good.   It is literally impossible to be good at this game unless you spend some money. You cannot be nearly decent at this game until you have a few character slots(you start off with one!!!!), a few vault chests(again, you start off with on!!!!), a good pet, and EXPENSIVE items that upgrade that pet.   As someone who has let their wallet vomit a bit too much( &gt;100$ spent in game), please for the love of not supporting this disgusting Pay To Win Freemium game model, don't get this game. And if you have it, dont spend $$. If you do, you are telling developers and cash grabbing companies that these kinds of games are okay to create and release to the good folk of the gaming community.
7730	0	a	I'm going to get a lot of hate for this. I'll just say that at first. but hear me out. The game is impossibly dificult to unlock other classes, and unless you buy money good gear is hard to get. You'll get torn to shreads with no hope of unlocking the next class. I'll say that if this game had a better way for better gear I would gladly play it more, but I'm not going to suport it unless it changes in some way.
7731	0	a	first of all, the cover art LIES. Second all you do i slay bosses and enimies then buy more sh** and it is imposible to get ONE token. emphisise on one, JUST ONE TOKEN. make a update where things are like the box art instead of one faced sprites and make tokens easier to get and maybe i will rate it better + others
7732	0	a	I told myself that I would never not reccomend a f2p game, unless given serious reason. I've been given serious reason.  This game, as it is right now, is playable and there are quite a few fun aspects of it. However, since Kabam bought RotMG, they bought crappy servers so we would die to lag, causing us to do the following:They made the game HEAVILY based on p2w, as you can buy bonus packages containing a ton of crap, the ability to buy ALL OF THE TOPS(for ridiculous amounts of money, and people do it), and then there are also the people illegally selling earned items and accounts within the game. Plus, someone came up with the brilliant idea of an event notifier so there are a ton of people around EVERY boss like the Hermit or Sphinx. They focused on adding more content instead of polishing the content that they have already put out. They added pets into the game, and if you fully level them at legendary(heal and magic heal), you become almsot invincible. Hackers are everywhere, and i havn't seen Kabam do ANYTHING to fix this problem. This game went from a real gem, to THIS. I still play it because, again, there are definitely fun aspects to the game itself. But, if I had 3 wishes to spend on games, I would use one to give Wildshadow back RotMG.
7733	0	a	This 'Game' is horrible. It consists of no real goals and a hot mess of enemies that all attack at once. You have no time to think, Real of the Mad God is not a fun game it is a stressful cluster f!@#. (nuff said)
7734	0	a	This could have been fun if it wasn't polluted with ♥♥♥♥. Now it's only the realm of mad players.
7735	0	a	Used to be one of my favorite F2P games on steam, Until it turned into a complete pay to win game... This isn't a game... It's a shop.
7736	0	a	i bought a pet humanoid and i never recieved it what should i do? please help
7737	0	a	Well, this game has definately got a case of 'Money Grubbing Developer Syndrome,' Doc. I never really played it that much, because I didn't have much fun at all. Practically everything half-decent in this game makes you do one of two things: Get stupidly good with your default class and get tons of gold, or pay stupid amounts of money. I mean, even F***ING PETS COST REAL MONEY! F***ING PETS!
7738	0	a	Years and years ago this was a pretty darned cool thing: a fantasy MMO that had no P2W qualities whatsover. Then Kabam got to it, and the rest is history.   I am aware of the funny mental image of the fat 30-year-old in his mother's basement saying 'rooened foreber oh noe.' Well, boo sucks to you coz I'm 16.
7739	0	a	How to play step 1. play game for a few mins  step 2.uninstall
7740	0	a	what happened to the shop?  Use points to buy items and cool stuff... poof now everything costs money but you can still buy a weapon for 50 or lower or something...poof now all that prices costs 51... poof now you start with 40 now you cant buy anything...
7741	0	a	YOU COULD ATLEAST GIVE YOU THE CHOICE TO NOT ERASE THE STUFF IN YOUR GIFT CHESTS!?!?!?!?!?!? PLEASE????!?!?!?!? I WASTED 50 DOLLARS ON STUFF BECAUSEI HAD NO WAY OF KNOWING IT ALL GOT DELETED WITHOUT A WARNING. IN MY OPINION YOU OWE ME 20 DOLLARS + ♥♥♥♥ING DEVELOPERS
7742	0	a	Okay, before I start this review I have but two things to say:  -I have very little hours on this account, as this is my alt account, that was made for Csgo. -This review goes a lot off of my personal experiences with this game.  Ahh, RotMG... This game kinda brings me a sense of nostalgia... This nostalgia brings on a lot of mixed feelings; I've had some of my best laughs, met new mates and plain and simple, had something to come back to when I was bored.  However, I also have bad experiences with this game such as the permanent death feature - don't get me wrong this doesn't make the game it's self bad, it's just not for me personally - which has made some of the angriest and most regretful moments of my gaming life.  There's also the pay to win path that I followed for a short while before realising, 'WAIT! I'm ♥♥♥♥ and keep dying, why am I spending money on crap I'm gonna lose in 2 days?'. To be fair I DID know that you could get all these items playing legit, but my low level newbie self didn't know how damned easy it was! Like seriously, $12 or something to get a dagger that one, I'm never going to use and two, would take about 1/2 hour of farming to obtain. So yeah, if you are going to play this game, avoid all the equipment shops in the nexus at all costs ;c;  Heres one that I've never really seen anyone but myself complain about; the classes are extremely unbalanced. People only ever play knight, warrior, wizard and possibly a dbow archer, with higher level players - unlike myself - having maxed every class, and still choosing to play these characters. Why? WELL, let me explain... Now, I'm pretty sure the original devs of RotMG, Wild Shadow Studios, never intended the game to be like WoW with full on raids and ♥♥♥♥. However, I'm pretty sure they wanted a teamwork element. These teamwork elements do not exist for multiple reasons:  -The two classes that have the highest defence in the game, also have some of the highest dps... WTF?! -Kabam added pets which attack enemies, but most importantly; heal, rendering the weaker defence healing classes USELESS! -Private loot. In other words, the classes with the highest dps - which again apart from wizard, have the HIGHEST defence in the game!? - are the only ones to get drops. -Some of the classes are utterly usless to the player, let alone a whole team.  It's because of these reasons that people only play high dps classes which are practically invincible, destroying the whole concept of teamwork.  Finally, there's the player base. I remember when I was a newb I had a 3/8 come up to me and give me some hydra skin armor. I didn't know what it was worth at the time and i was playing knight, so I couldn't wear it anyway, and my friend offered me a crossbow - a ♥♥♥♥♥ item - for this hydra skin - a legendary item to a newb - and being the newbie I was I accepted - the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ XD. Despite looking back fondly on stories like these, people who create stories and friendships in this game no longer exist. Ever since a RotMG YouTuber by the name of Kalle quit the game - the first real major game figure to leave - the whole veteran community left. By that time I was a mid level player, stranded in a waste land of guildless people keeping to themselves and not talking to anyone. As a result, me and my mates slowley started to quit the game. In other words - the friendly community is practically dead ;c;  Overall, I did enjoy and make memories on this game, but that was back in the golden days of early 2013. It's the 3/1/2016 as I am writing this - happy late new year everyone! - and I jumped into the game a few weeks ago to see if any of my guildies still played. To my (sarcastic) surprise, the guild was disbanded. I was left a PM on the RotMG forum:  'G'day Eoghann how've you been? How's school been or whatever?  You know what, I'll cut to it. We've disbanded as a guild due to the sheer lack of enjoyable community. Most of us are moving onto WoW and we were wonding if you'd like to join us? If so, contact me here: *nopenopenopenopenopenope*  ~Regards, *nopenopenope*'  3.5/10
7743	0	a	I know it may seem like I have no hours, but in reality, I have at least spent 1000 hours on this game in browser. This was one of the best games at the time with variety, but now everything is corrupt. It used to be, play for a while to get good with somewhat good stuff, but now, rich noobs can just buy the highest tier weapon and armor, or even just go on a website that constantly spams to get a maxed out character. With no experience what so ever, they can ravage the community easily and destroy pretty much anything easily. After the update, I wont recommend at all.
7744	0	a	Cons about playing this game -rampant spambots -rampant hackers -rampant scammers -nothing done about any of the above -paying to have more than one character slot -paying to have more than 8 item storage -half of the character selection screen is the week's advertisement (WOW! 10 ambrosia for only 90 US dollars!) -inactive company posts on forums -fame (the earnable currency) has literally 2 uses: pet feeding and guild upgrades -its marketed like its not a P2W -highly unbalanced pet system -the only way you can actually start having any lasting fun in this game without spending money is making multiple accounts -most recent update's only purpose was to render an item unusable because it was being exploited (so take that as you will)  Pros of playing this game -its crack -literall crack -really the concept of the game is actaully pretty great but all the cons get in the way of truly enjoying it  The reason I am making this review now is that, before, the game was relatively tolerable but now the quality of co-players has just degenerated completely to the point where there are as many hacking players are there are legitamate players and Kabam has done, and will continue to do, nothing about it.
7745	0	a	kabam ruined the game,just,dont. ( i had more than 600 hours in the browser version )
7746	0	a	I enjoyed this game for the very short time I was able to play it. I'm giving a bad review because of a game-breaking bug leaving myself, and many other players stuck out of the game, completely unable to play.  The developers are aware of the bug at this point, and after having many conversations with support about the issue, it seems that they simply don't care.  The bug in question, is getting stuck on the black screen with the grey 'Loading' ribbon across the bottom. Even if left for hours, the game will never actually load. I initially contacted support about this back in February, and I've had to make multiple tickets due to previous ones automatically closing.  To this day, the issue is still unresolved for me. I'll update this review if that changes, but I'll probably leave it as a negative because of what a joke the support team is.  Get your ♥♥♥♥ together, Kabam, you're only harming yourself through losing potential customers.
7747	0	a	Pay 2 Win..... Thats all I have to say. Dont do it.

7754	0	a	I was going to pick up this game again after a couple of years, only to realise that some company called Kabam came and messed up the fun game I once enjoyed. I would've recommended the game to you if you were playing in 2012.
7755	0	a	Pay to win, laggy servers, and full of hackers and multiboxers.

7767	0	a	amazing concept amazing community     the devs on the other hand...
7768	0	a	hoarders can get piles of money
7769	0	a	for now i cannot recommend this game because it won't launch for me off steam.   so i went to the browser version of the game and it just wouldn't go any further than the load screen once it hit 100%.  hopefully this fixes one day i will try and launch it once a month too see if it is. just because im interested in trying er' out.   DEBUG:  Error:list index out of range   options are : press okay . or just close the game.      EDIT : by the way i literally had to open this game in steam and let it sit there and do nothing for 5 whole minutes before it would let me post this review. 10/10 would sit and look at debug information again .
7770	0	a	I used to love this game, if you want to play a game that's dying and gives you fun until you die due to hackers then be my guest. i'm not going to go off on a rage againts kabam and them buying the game (because honestly i know they're money-hungry, but who isn't?), ♥♥♥♥.. i would milk the ♥♥♥♥ out of this game until the money runs out because i would be surprised if this game lasts another year or two.
7771	0	a	fun to play for like 10 minutes     then it gets boring and redundant   if u gonna play play as the priest so y'all can dab in the church
7772	0	a	I used to play this game on kongregate. Tons of 8-bit fun and then I saw it was on steam, so I downloaded it and for some reason the steam version has tons of gliches and bugs and my game crashed multiple times. Not worth it!(even if it's free) If you want to try this game, I suggest going on Kongregate and playing the flash version. Also for some reason it might say on this review that I have 0 hrs on record. Not sure why, but i have played this game for hours.
7773	0	a	I didn't like it.... The same music is playing all the time. I wish this game had multipile soundtracks. Also this game is filled with spammers what makes normal chatting impossible. But this is just my opinion. I am not really trying to stop you from playing this game.
7774	0	a	play this game, if you are as rich a taylor swift and can afford microtransactions ,to only lose all that money to lag and scammers. If you want to live longer uninstall and get a new steam account that doesnt have to game.
7775	0	a	The Kabam is real
7776	0	a	well the game is completly PAY To ♥♥♥♥ING WIN! now that it sucks! i realy hate kabam!
7777	0	a	I wish I could recomend this... I use to play this all the time. In it's prime it was one of the best games on steam. Over the years though the playerbase has died and the devs have become greedy. I wowld recomend it in it's prime but not at the state it's in now.
7778	0	a	Kabam rigged this like a demolitions expert. Let me elaborate. This was a nice local resturant, with a speciality meal hardly seen before. It was a mix of rogue-like and bullet hell. There were bullets everywhere and if you couldn't handle the heat, it was back to the start. But starting over isn't all bad. You got fame, a currency that could be used on goods to get yourself running hotter. You could also unlock new classes for a spin on the taste. It was a nice resturant, filled with a jovial atmosphere. But then the owner handed it over to a rather greedy man. Now it is a pit of money and shame, filled with people looking to scam and the food reminicent of a fast food resturant. Nobody was happy, but the owners.
7779	0	a	This game has been passed through a lot of companies and each one has been steadily worse than the last. The latest company to obtain the game is particularly rude. Insulting players, using crude language, and being completely unprofessional. The game itself may not be for everyone but I considered it fun for a while. That said I refuse to play any more just because I don't like the people now in charge.
7780	0	a	Dear Kabam, i hate this game and you but i still try to play it. Yesterday i lost my priest with great stuff: I was on dexworld with priest and i saw my hitpoints was going down. I tried to heal myself (i got mana almost full) but it didnt heal and then i died but there was no shots coming to me. ♥♥♥♥ this ♥♥♥♥ and 1 time i was blinking but i didnt go to nexus i had like 150HP with my op knight and then some god hits me once 37 dmg i died to dat! WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥?!!? Can u fix then also drop rates: i did like 100 dex worlds and only a half i got dex. Then my friend does 1 and gets planewalker. Then i was on cemetary with some guy we were in second boss i did like half of dmg and i got 0 and he got scammy. Kabam you are corrupted, you want only money. And when u got hacked for a while ALL the players tought u will give UT trade weekend or something but u give only some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ loot tier and drop potions. KABAM PLZ FIX UR ♥♥♥♥♥ AND GIVE ME SOME REFUNDS
7781	0	a	Pay to win game and takes way to much of your money to win.

7785	0	a	This game COULD've been good. But it's not. Repititive, dull and possibly the MOST pay to win in a game. I suppose you could have about a half hour worth of fun, but after that, it just gets old.
7786	0	a	Kabam is simply a network of greedy ♥♥♥♥♥es who pay no money for their servers and half the time you get sucked in by oryx, pro or not.
7787	0	a	This game, oh god this game. RotMG was fun when TIGsource was the lead dev but now Kabam now owns RotMG and they ****** up. Kabam made this game from actual fun to pay-to-pay. There is permadeath so all of your levels, items and cool skins you got are gone ad you have to restart again. you can pretty much BUY all of your gear making all of your stuff have no value at all. And to top all of this off you can't even play right now because LOGIC i give this game 1.0000000000001/10

7789	0	a	Why would I recommend this? well this game has SOOOO SO much potential, and i heard it used that potential for good, but i have seen reveiws saying it only wants your money, i think this is true, i cant even play, i launch the game and login but the bottom right of my screen is taken up by an ad begging for your money, I CANT EVEN PLAY BECAUSE THEY WANT MONEY!

7791	0	a	Though Realm of The Mad God may be an excellent game, I have no idea, I found many connection issues while trying to play. This may be due to servers being located in a reach from the UK or just my internet connection but sadly, I cannot reccomend this game as my experiance was very poor.
7792	0	a	{Rant}  Game used to be one the most fun games I will ever have played but new developers have ruined it to its core. Too many micro-transactions and a lot of focus on paying to win basically. Pets are the key to survival which are insanely hard to get up to speed without farming trench's or etc. for a long time without paying money. And all new dungeons, and items, and in general game updates are focused around spending money for top tier gear whether it be the mystery box with a low chance for an extreme payout, or buying 'tops' straight up. 8 '8/8's' no longer feels like I earned it since anyone can buy tops and farm fairly easily (but most likely die and give me a good laugh), UT's drop frequently and the game just feels like a massive, overpowering player base with no challenge any longer (especially with pets) and is just a waste of time to farm.  {Summary} Large changes such as UT's being non-tradeable or the disappearance of amulets is not what ruined the game, it's the most recent p2w schemes, aka mystery box of profit that tear away from the core point of farming and finally having the RNG in your favor for that moment when you've achieved a great set after good work, not having exclusive items in the mystery box that won't be in a dungeon for 3 months...  {Suggestion} I love Warframe and League of Legends, for some reason a LOT of RoTMG players left for league, not sure why but I was hooked also so check them out, realm is just not worth the time any longer. And Warframe gives a perfect feel for the payout for time you put in farming, very Face of Mankind esque but updated constantly and very satisfying to play unlike another great games downfall.   (The Big Lebowski) Has the world gone crazy? Seen too many games go to ♥♥♥♥....
7793	0	a	I can't play it with the maitenance problem going on it says it needs to do maitenance but when you click on ok it just sits there doing nothing i've deleted it redownloaded it same thing again and again. I've googled it and other people are having the same problem right now so i can't say its a good game if it won't even load. R.I.P the browser verison of this game it was the best.
7794	0	a	This game used to be fun, but it just went downhill
7795	0	a	This game SUCKS! All you are doing is running around, paying money and fight some bosses that spawn every second. Why could people call this a good game? Okay, the combat is pretty fun, but come on. Just running around with NO freaking goal?  2/10  It would be a 1/10 if the combat wasn't fun.
7796	0	a	Don't get me wrong, at the early stages of this game it was great fun to run around with your friends, loot, clear dungeon, and kill Oryx. However, since late 2013 when Kabam came to ownership the game became extremly P2P. If you want to ever get anywhere in the game you have to buy multiple character and vault chests so that you have backup characters and loot. Vault chests only hold 8 items and cost 5 ♥♥♥♥ing dollars a piece. Aswell as making most legendery loot hard as ♥♥♥♥ to obtain, they took out trading of UT items, So once you get the legendary loot if its not for your class you're SOL. My reccomendation is to avoid playing this until Kabam lifts their P2P hammer.

7801	0	a	i like this game alot and i would spend more time with it if it were not a pay to win game. that being said it removes the need for actual skill and effort if you will just throw a few dollars there way and if you dont oyu can sit there and grind for hours. in the tow hours i played i got about 30 gold and to get new charecters its around 900 gold a charecter. i wish i could love this game but i simply cant im not spending money on a free game that isnearly impossible to progress in without spending money.

7803	0	a	To be honest if there was an option of recomending it and not, i would choose that. I mean this game is just that to me, 50/50. See, let me start off by saying i played this on Kong back in October of 2011, loved it. A few laggy moments but that was because of an overloaded server (which is very unlikely to happen). Than summer of 2012 came. And oh boy, did it start to change. I have been noticing the monoplizing of the market place, everything was very steeply priced, and i couldn't afford it. So i played as a noob for about a year or so. Left ROTMG, left Kong. And came to steam. And then i found ROTMG, i was exstatic. It was very nostalgic for me. But then i noticed the market, it got HUGE, little portals to smaller markets, eggs, food, and dungeon keys, it was very surreal. And then i finally gave in, and bought some vaults (because i started getting good and had little to no area to put my loot). Big mistake, that was when Kabam milked my steam wallet dry. I mean it was my decision, but my back was against the wall, the game that i loved back then, or other games. And that is why i don't recomend ROTMG, it started out play to win, now its just pay to win. 4.5/10
7804	0	a	Was a really good game before, but now its a pay2win kinda game. It can be fun but its very grindy.
7805	0	a	Worst game ever played.

7808	0	a	Boring top down shooter meets mmo hybrid.  At least it's not a point and click hitscan game, but it feels like there's almost no design to the gameplay (either in the maps or the random enemies, whom you all fight pretty much the same). The combat doesn't even feel like a shooter, as it often rewards just staying away from enemies rather than skillfully dodging and weaving through enemy attacks.  Like all MMO's it supposedly gets better, but even people who have stuck with it tell me that it's ultimately more of a WoW style loot farming game than a true action experience. So if the 'shmup mmo hybrid' got you excited, you might want to check your enthusiasm in my oppinion.
7809	0	a	I'm gonna make this short. I sadly can't recommend this game on the basis that it's a P2P (Pay to Play) disguised as a F2P (Free to Play). Most of the good items in this game are in the store, which you can only buy with gold. But the only way to get gold is to buy it with actual money from your account. And no, there isn't anyway to earn gold in the actual game. If you aren't the kind that's willing to spend money to get the good items, then chances are you won't enjoy this game (or at least not as much as you should).
7810	0	a	This game used to be a very fun and exciting game to play. But ever since Kabam took over, the game became a Pay to Win game. You could buy end game items in the nexus with money and stuff. The game is now filled with Hackers, Dupers, Multiboxers, and etc. R.I.P, RotMG.

7816	0	a	I am a very old payer of this game, ever since WildShadow owned it and there was the old forums. This game used to be amazing, fun, interactive and enjoyable. You had to put time into the game to get anywhere, and even then you could lose it all in one death. Regardless of that, it hooked almost all players of this game who were willing to put 5+ hours a week. Personally, I was very addicted to this game during 2011 and 2012. Then, doomsday came: Kabam bought Realm of The Mad God. Everything was transformed into buying gold to achieve things. Back in the old days, you had to grind dungeons to get an incantation to just maybe get a tier 12 item in the wine cellar. Now, just buy realm gold and get tier 12 items in nexus. It's ♥♥♥♥ed up. Unless you're rich as ♥♥♥♥ and don't care about money, don't get this game.

7825	0	a	Used to be great, but then Kabam ruined it.
7826	0	a	I can only find two problems with this game. Unfortunately, both problems make the game virtually unplayable. 1. Too much Pay 2 Win. Seriously. This is the WORST pay 2 win I have seen in ANY game. EVER! Even EA is shocked by the excessive Pay 2 Win (Fun Fact: I actually like EA.). Half the game's content needs the coins, which it's hyper hard to get any unless you're shelling out money for them. Without coins, you have a half-♥♥♥♥♥ game with very little content available. 2. The controls are UN-RE-FREAKING-SPONSIVE! I disabled shadows, I set the game to windowed, I disabled text bubbles, and I even closed everything off except for this game, and the controls are still barely managable! My character, for no reason, decides to go left when I want him to go right. sometimes, he doesen't even move at all! Literally ALL of my deaths recently was because of the ♥♥♥♥-poor controls. This game isn't a bad concept. However, these two problems are both equally bad, and bad enough to turn the game into a complete mess.
7827	0	a	too much pay to win
7828	0	a	Rating: 2/10  You just walk around and shoot ♥♥♥♥ that skitters along the sand, did I also mention that the chat is filled with free hax and gold? I don't know how people can play this game.  I will never play it again, period.

Cash flows through that game like blood in veins  5. Why would i really need gold coins just to buy a difffrent charcter and useless pets  6. Dying in this game is just not worth playing it at all  7. 999 coins just for 1 character?!  8. The ads/Chat is so overpopulated plz add close chat  9. The game doesnt tell you what to do besides kill things  10. The warps are to confusing and people stealing stuff like hobos over a chicken leg

7845	0	a	This is a pay to win game.   The best free to play games are the ones that have micro transactions only for cosmetics and dlc's (expansions). any game that does not fall within this type is usually not the best games to play.
7846	0	a	This game is one of the most fun and unigue games out there. However, it is kind of pay2win since people with a lot of money can just buy realm gold and other stuff. It also sucks that you can't trade almost all the UT items. I'm 13 now; stopped playing this game on Kongregate when I was 9 and came back to try it. So many things have changed and I'm not even sure whether it was for the better or worse. If you like a game that is kind of pay2win but still fun and can put up with that, this is your game.
7847	0	a	This game is a p2w game or better know as pay to win and I say this because if you dont buy like a rank or anything like that you have to spend countless hours more then if you pay.

7858	0	a	The funny thing is, Realm of the Mad God (which I will abbreviate as Rotmg) is probably my second favorite game on steam. Now you may be wondering why I do not recommend this. I personally like this game myself, but this is for those who are new or are considering the download. Rotmg is a bullet hell fantasy 'shooter' (I guess you could vaguely call it one.) It's played in a top down style and has an interesting graphics palette. I do not consider myself 'good'(although I will call myself decent.) So what are the key concepts of rotmg? Well the first major one is a love hate situation. Permadeath. You may have heard of this mechanic, but it basically means dead is dead. Which means that you lose all of your items and potions you used on that character. But don't worry, characters usually last for months if you know how to play well. This has actually caused a lot of players to quit by losing for example, only, or favorite character. However, there is sort of a counter to this, which is known as a Vault. The vault is exactly what it seems like. It's room with a private chest where you can put your own items in . They never leave unless you take them. So, overall you may think this is a great game, which, it is.  But the thing is, at around late 2012, rotmg started to fall into decline, it was subtle at first, but eventually it was very noticeable. Where did this come from? The most probable (and everyone blames it on this) reason is Kabam. What's Kabam? Kabam is a game company, they own Rotmg. Now the reason I said own is because they did not make the game, the game itself was created by Wild Shadow Studios. Now Kabam bought Wild Shadow in late 2012, and one of the first things they did was remove Amulets of Resurrection. Basically these were things you could wear that stopped you from dying if you got to 0 hp. Now, that may sound overpowered, but scammies did cost a lot in 'fame' which is all the xp you gain. When Kabam removed amulets, a lot of players quit, and killed a lot of players to show their ignorance. But for a while, all was quiet and peaceful until about February 2013, now this is when I can start to recall things, because I actually started playing in Jan. 2013. In about February, Kabam did something to the Nexus Shops that we will all remember. Now, for those who do not understand. The Nexus is an area that's a safe haven, it's similar to like the Forums of Rome, you can chat there, some nexuses are devoted to trading, etc. When Wild Shadow was in control, there were shops in the nexus. You could use fame, which I previously mentioned, on some items, or Realm Gold, an ingame currency bought with real money. Realm Gold is worth about 1:1 cent. 100 Realm Gold is a dollar. Realm Gold in the old days could buy, hell I don't even know what it could buy, but I think you bought stuff like backpacks and XP Boosters with it, which they still do today. You can also buy vault chests and character slots, unlike some companies, Wild Shadow managed their ingame currency pretty well, not trying to nickel and dime you. But what Kabam did in February last year, was to sell GOOD items in the nexus. Now what Kabam used to do, was sell what most people thought were 'junk' in the nexus. For example, by most players who would regard an item as trash, a particular sword, costed about 200 Realm Gold. Now although this was a ripoff, most players were happy and fine, because not to many people would be 'stupid' enough to buy them, but Kabam started selling higher tiered items for about the same price. This made players angry, all their hard work could go to waste by a few clicks and a username and password on paypal. At first it was just weapons and armor. But then Kabam added 'tops.' Tops are one of the best items in the game, Tier 12 weapons, Tier 13 Armor. These could cost almost $9 at most, and made a lot of players angry. However, Kabam made it even worse, by selling Abilities, special items that each class has, and rings, stat boosting items, in the nexus. Now to put the icing on the cake, Kabam did something that devestated a lot of players, and still a big deal. This was around May 2013, Kabam made all 'Untiered' (very good items) Soulbound, which means they cannot be tradable. Kabam did this to 'prevent duping' and they would fix duping. Almost 2 years and still, their soulbound.   Lately, Kabam has actually been doing a good job. But this review is advice for new players, I promise you, you probably won't have the best experience. There are less people in the servers, this game is slowly dying.
7859	0	a	It wont let me play. Please fix this and ill rate higher because I love this game
7860	0	a	not worth it...simple as that
7861	0	a	Updates turned this game into microtransaction pay to win hell, instead of fixing the simple problems. You may be able to get some fun out of it nowadays, but you may have to struggle really hard
7862	0	a	as people know this well sucks when kabam took over now they added pets really and how the pets not killable and also they add pets to make this more fun nope not really you see the pets almost made you like unkillable a divine ones and plus this game you spend money nope its not when you get into the mediumish mode like me you some of your items you have actually cost money ITS JUST A GAME not reality see kabam Is like a robber coming to your house at night and robbing your money I can't stand this anymore someone has to get wild shadow back this game and kabam 0/10
7863	0	a	The gameplay is overall good, but the bloody microtransactions are rediculess. They hinder and annoy you, inconvienencing you. You cannot make additional characters unless you want to fork over 10 dollars, if you want additional storage in your vault(and you are going to need a way to store your items if you want to get anywhere in the game) that would be 5 dollars a chests, which holds 8 items each. It would takes over a hundred dollars to even unlock all of your storage space. Even the big fans of the game do not buy additional storage, but instead go make additional characters on the game's website and on Kongragate to use as additional storage and are known as 'mules.' Even when using mules it is annoying.  The gameplay is good, a semi-rogue like where your characters die and stay dead but you can store items to help your next character. The Nexus, the central hub of the game, is constantly filled with advertisers that will fill up your screen instantly. The gameplay is frustrating at times, especially because you can die very quickly with little to no warning, but is fun. The higher level you get, the more cautious you have to be. The game encourages team play, but it would take actual coordination to get anywhere with it.  Overall, game is good, but is absolutely ruined by the amount of microtransactions.
7864	0	a	This game used to be very enjoyable to play with friends and farm for epic loot, but now Kabam decided to make this game pay to win. If you want a fun mmo with great dungeons and a fun community get this game, but be warned: if you die you will feel like quitting. Overall it is a game I will come back to every now and then but there simply isn't enough content for me to keep playing since this is a VERY repetitive game. It is fun for a few hours once you get the hang of it but you will become very bored after awhile. In the end, it is a decent game but i would nto recommend it for the average mmo gamer.
7865	0	a	This is a great free to play game if your willing to put time into grinding i use to play it before it even came out as a game on steam and i am sad to say it was much better in when it was not on steam. I dont think this has any thing to do with the new community on it i think has something to do with the greedy developers.In the days i use to play this it use the be hard to get t12 bow or sword it use to take time and effort if tht were still the game i would totally recommend it however now a days ty to the greedy developers any old scrub can come in with a credit and get T12 gear thts why i dont recommend this game to anyone without a credit card
7866	0	a	Second Life is better optimized then this game, do you know how well second life is optmized? Not at all. Look at the photos above, now look at my review, get my point?   Here's my detailed review below.  Pros:   +Easy to learn and get used to, i can see you getting lost in this game for a while.  +Multiple classes with their own feel.  +Healer class, that's awesome if you are playing with a friend.  +Infinite maps.  +Instanced Tutorial (those are awesome)  Cons:  -Where did you go? Where am I? Where is that? What's going on? Oh look more enemies. (WHO NEEDS A MAP?!)  -Party system is horrible.  -level 100 butterfly has slain you. (Not at all epic for a monster, only Monty Python can get away with this. :P )  -classes locked unless you go through different tasks to unlock them.  -dear god, the lag, the horrible unoptimized lag! (Look, if i can run plenty of recent games at max then it's not me)  -communication is difficult.  -Hope you don't like fullscreen.  Neither pro or con:  = Sprite art is okay.  = Instant action.  = Simple -------------------------  Take this review as you will, it's just here to give you perspective before you hop in, not for those expert super pro players who are already at the top of the scoreboard and have 500+ hours of the game, what are you going through reviews for anyway? It's not a popularity contest and this is what i really think about it, and that's the purpose of reviews. Shoo!   Hope this helped you. :3

7870	0	a	For a game that's basically just a bunch of pixels shooting at each other it now has ridiculously high micro-transaction prices. Still fun to play for a while, but really not worth a serious time/money investment.
7871	0	a	this game ruined my life
7872	0	a	A while ago this was one of, if not the best online flash game I had ever played. You would be so engrossed in grinding items with the one fear of losing it all because your computer would lag when you spammed your 'Escape to Nexus' key.  However once Kabam took over, the game has lost its touch. Although there are many new aspects that have been added to the game, such as new dungeons, weapons, pets, I feel that the cons outweigh the pros.  Too much stuff has become purchasable, enemy and item spawn rates have been dramatically decreased. Worst of all the highest tier weapons have become untradable. The only way to get them is to grind them (which now takes 100 times as long) or use your money to get them directly, or speed up the process. This of course is stupid as you will probably lose all the items anyway, resulting in a waste of money.  All in all this once amazing, rage-inducing, time-wasting game that 99.99% of people who played it enjoyed has gone from F2P to P2W. I'm sure 99.99% of people who play it now would agree with me that this game has become worse since Kabam took over.

7877	0	a	I belive that this game is absolutly crap. here is a list of reasons why you should not play this game: Sticky keys your keys seem to be stuck but they arnt the game is just crapily designed, You shoot stuff your only way to attack is to shoot stuff with any type of weapon like swords, You get booted off all the time, The only way to close an add is to click buy, The game barely ever loads the map, Lots of people spam chat, The game is very laggy and rubbish although I have an amazing computer, A macintosh could run this game and not get any lag that is how crappy it is, It is never updated, and it is so unoptimized it will just drag a lot that is how rubbish it is.
7878	0	a	I read all the reviews saying it was ruined so I installed it again after years, and boy. This game was one of my favorite things, and now it is truly a festering pile of crap. It is only satisfying to play if you enjoy the feeling of uninstalling instantly.

7883	0	a	This game was perfect, great gameplay, great community, all around amazing.  Then this game hopped on the P2P train when the new company bought out this game, it says free, but if you want to get anywhere without grinding for 20 hours then doing 1 quest then grind for another 20 hours then... you will have too shell out money, money upon money upon money, and trust me, people did, some people dropped 100's of dollars, also, you can't fight them, they will win every fight.  People shell out a lot of money just to PLAY a FREE to play game, and best part is, if you die, you lose all your ♥♥♥♥, then you gotta pay more, it's a loop.   Gameplay: 5/10 Community: 1/10 Market: 1/10 PvP: 3/10 PvE: 4/10 ------------------ Overall 2/10  Who would this game be for? Rich people that can't afford a $20 dollar game so they blow $100 dollars on a 'F2P' game.

7888	0	a	Gone to complete ♥♥♥♥ shortly after Kabam acquired the game. Should have expected it, judging from all the other terrible games it published. If you decide to play and ignore all the money grab the game, then its fun enough for a while but having 1 character slot gimps you a lot, especially for new people who die a lot. It also sells you highest tier gear in the cash shop, which lures in new players who buy and then instantly lose $10+ from dying. Also, having a good pet costs tons of money, so be prepared to spend lots of time grinding out fame or paying for better pets. Its not necessary to have a pet but it makes everything so much easier and increases your survivability, which in a game of permadeath, is very important. A maxed divine pet is $500+. The game has perma death so dying is pretty devastating. If you decide to buy anything, stick to character slots and vaults.

It used to be a badass co-op bullet hell that was super-fun and based around permadeath and earning better ♥♥♥♥ through surviving the godlands long enough to kill Oryx with like 30 people.

7912	0	a	I used to play this game a ton! Luckly I started when Kabam first bought the game everything was super cheap and it was fun that way. You could easily get really good items and start having tons of fun. But then Kabam ♥♥♥♥ed it up big time! Putting markets in spawn for gold skins for charcters. Now every thing is hugely expensive and just boring. You have to grind like hell to do ♥♥♥♥ in the game. This game is ♥♥♥♥ing terrible. The only way to get gold is to spend money and the prices are insane! It was good but now it sucks.  Sorry for language im just really annoyed a good game like this became so bad.

7917	0	a	- Multiboxers - Pay 2 win - Hackers everywhere - ♥♥♥♥ RNG - Lags half the time  It is still quite fun to play but just too laggy and there are hackers and multis everywhere meaning you can't do enough damage to get loot from half the bosses. You go into one ice cave and half of the dungeon are sitting inside the wall saying 'TP FOR FREE TOPS' or 'TP FOR UBHP' and try to trap other people inside the wall. As well as community being mostly 9 year olds.

7920	0	a	Bad game.  No  good or helpful community. Bad graphics. Boring gameplay. I literally can't even play because it's resolution is not adjustable. The tutorial only told me how to attack and how to move. It should be classified a beta or alpha stage it's so undeveloped. Not here to rain on its parade though. The main concept is pretty good atleast. I wouldn't advise you to get it.
7921	0	a	Honestly, this game would be fun, if it wasn't pay2play and super laggy. I just stopped playing it when I was walking to a dungeon and I hit a lag spike. Then a few seconds later, It said I died and I had to restart.  3/10 (I gave it a few points because the game itself is kinda fun when its not lagging like crazy)

7925	0	a	This could just be me, but i honestly don't like this game, whenever i try to move my charecter, he doesnt move, when he does move he moves way farther than i want him to, and i know it isnt my computer, on every other game i have ever played, i get around 150 fps, so yeah, idk, this may not happen to you, but i don't like it.
7926	0	a	Ahh. Realm of the Mad God. I have about 350 hours on this game. Here's how I'd rate it. Do you like endlessly grinding and farming to achieve no purpose at all in fear that your character will die? Don't you just love feeling no satisfaction at all once you've finally reached the maximum point and maxed out a character's stats? Well this is the game for you! Enjoy countless hours of painful, agonizing farming where you hold down the left mouse button and sometimes press the space bar, and avoid little pixelated bullets aimed towards you in order for you to feel dissatisfaction. This game was built to be the first stepping stone to ruining your life.  HOWEVER. I enjoyed it thoroughly on my first 100 to 200 hours. It was fun. Unlocking each class was really fun. However, it gets dull and boring with repetititivity.

7928	0	a	Since kabam started i was like 0_0
7929	0	a	I wasn't an old player in this game - I started playing this game when my friend introduced me to the game. I didn't like it much. First of all, there are constantly people crowding around the nexus, spamming messages like 'EY BUY MY STUFF ON THIS RANDOM WEBSITE!'. Not just one person either; imagine a whole army of people, afk, just spamming useless messages using bots.  Second of all, really good loot is hard to come by. You play for a long time, and if you're really lucky, you MIGHT get T3 or T4 items. I once played through for three hours, but not get any items above T4. Good items? They're all in the shops, and all of them are super OP and great. Free to play? B*tch please, this ain't no free to play game. People who pay killsteal you at boss battles, and the others, the freemium players, they won't get anything because the mob of P2Ps cleared everything.  If Kabam stopped owning this game, I would play it more.  Otherwise, it's (almost) a complete piece of sh*t.
7930	0	a	This is a great game and i played it a long long time ago when i saw it on steam i was very excited  the only problem was: i couldent log in with my account. i was already logged in with a steam created account..wtf.the worse part is, that i can logg.im forced to play with this account.i cant logg in with my real account plees help me someone
7931	0	a	RotMG is an awesome game, but the developers need to calm down, and pull back with their cash-grab ideals.  Pay for items with real cash; perma-death and lose everything.  Seems  kinda stupid ? It is.

7937	0	a	Ever since this game was bought by a bigger company, the game has gone to hell. Nowadays the game just wants to get your money in every possible way.  YES, the game's free to play - AND it's quick to install and get into - but the gameplay suffers from the great monetization. The game might be fun for the first few hours, but after that you're just getting annoyed by all the cash milking around you.  Avoid. For now.
7938	0	a	I used to play this game all the time.  I tried it now here and it's not good at all. So many things that you need to purchase to even do anything.
7939	0	a	Kabam is being a total ♥♥♥ and not letting people connect to their game from their web browser ('www'.'realmofthemadgod'.'com') which is just bullcrap.
7940	0	a	I did not like this game because the servers take so long to connect to, and after like 4.234 hours of connection errors, I was finally able to get onto a server, but it was laggy even in the tutorial and my guy kept on moving on his own when I fought baddies. Valve pls fix
7941	0	a	This used to be a fun game back when it came out but it is showing its age now.  Realm is a bullet hell game with perma-death! Mess up once and you are done for my friend, it is all the way back to the beginning with you, or is it? Well yes it is but let me explain. You can go anywhere at anytime and reaching the level cap is not very difficult so end game revolves around maxing your character via potions that increase your stats.  Get enough potions and you will max all your stats and that is it, nothing left to do. Or at least it was until pets were added and pets last between deaths so that was a welcomed addition but honestly the game is solely about min-maxing and once you have done that their is nothing left to do. This is compounded by the fact that not only does maxing your stats take a very long time but the dungeons you run to get the potions to max your stats are usually pretty lethal so you will rage quit quite a few times when your 4/8 character dies.   I had fun with the game originally but I used joy2key to make the game playable with a controller and that was very imperfect but I found it a step up from the default control scheme and that is a big reason I don't recommend the game.  The screen is extremely zoomed in so you are normally attacked by things off-screen before you even have a chance to see them so you are dodging many bullets while guessing where they are coming from. Increasing the screen resolution does nothing to help (it doesn't scale) and enemies can come from  any  direction so you need to be on your toes often which can be fun when you first start out but when you are at the stage of trying to actually not die, it is just plain fustrating. Why controller support hasn't been added yet is mind-blowing.   One of the appeals of the game is that you can play with other players too, you know like an MMO but this is a lie. Other players exist but whoever does the most damage to a monster gets the loot it drops if it drops anything at all (low drop rates, of course) so naturally you want to be in the front line performing lots of damage right? Well yes you do but go look at the screenshots for this game and you might notice something which is all the sprites are flat and 2D and nothing seperates your characters from all the 100s of others so other players will actually be your biggest cause of death many times, rather than something you want to actively seek out since you can't even tell where you are when a 'omega death blow' homes in and kills you with a dozen other players just blocking your view.  Overall its a game you can jump into and enjoy but as soon as you try to  really  take the game seriously you will realize how shallow and fustrating it really is and the fact it hasn't improved over the years really doesn't help.

7942	0	a	its not suitable for a classical pc-gamer.  looting things only rewards you in gear, no gold (u cant sell looted items for ingame gold - u have to buy ingame gold for shop items)  but funny thing, u can trade with others. in the end u go in shady botspammed internetsites and buy items there...  pros u only have 1 live with your charakter, so keep it hardcore unless u want to spend some money.  cons. cash gives you somehow a 'cheat'  technical contains bugs and isnt state-of-the-art.

Plz fixing this peice of ♥♥♥♥ microsoft thanks. PYAH!
7944	0	a	Do you remember when this game was a browser based free to play game? Do you remember playing it for your first time years ago, when all players were equal and skill was required to rise in the ranks? I do, I remember when this game was first released, I've been around since the beggining, and I miss it. Anyone new to ROTMG you've missed the time when the game was in it's prime, before it became heavily pay to win.   The game has definitely retained it's difficulty, and some of the new changes are cool and fun, but in whole the community that this game built was shattered when it was bought out. Many people left, veterans and legends in the games history alike.  Aside from the past, the current ROTMG I would not reccomend for anyone who is looking for a casual experience, this game takes some time to progress through, and one screw up will send you hurtling back to square one with nothing to show for your hardships and time. It's one of those games where you have to persist and if you really want to move forward quickly you'll have to learn how to speak ROTMG slang and get in with the community, join a guild, make a group, farm. Their will be a lot of farming once you reach the level cap.

7946	0	a	Perma-Death really is a pain in the ♥♥♥ in this game. I love the concept, the graphics and gameplay are fun and smooth but other than that I don't reccomend it because of Perma-Death. I like having the same character, and having many levels and skills to unlock. In this, there's only a few levels per character, and there's only so much to explore. If they remove perma-death, and increase the amount of levels and skills, I would reccomend this game. Until then, I don't reccomend this game.

7949	0	a	Pros: Not to sound biased but... None I can think of.  Cons: - Permadeath. In an RPG. With inventory loss. - Awful graphics, even for me - and I love pixel graphics. - It's pay to win. Enough said. - Most of it is just going around the same areas killing different enemies. - You get almost no help whatsoever. - The gameplay is so simple its just boring and repetitive. - Skill won't help you win. It's mostly relies on luck. - Hardly any content. How do I know? The entire game literally took 3 secs to download with average internet. - Much like WOW, you have to pay real money to anything. Even changing your name.  - Speaking of names, you can only have a name 10 characters long.  So, overall, my opinion of this game is that it's terrible. I recommend you find a good rpg instead, like Neverwinter. Even though that's pay to win too, it at least gives you a chance to actually play the game - and enjoy it.
7950	0	a	Better than NBA.
7951	0	a	its not suitable for a classical pc-gamer.  looting things only rewards you in gear, no gold (u cant sell looted items for ingame gold - u have to buy ingame gold for shop items)  but funny thing, u can trade with others. in the end u go in shady botspammed internetsites and buy items there...  pros u only have 1 live with your charakter, so keep it hardcore unless u want to spend some money.  cons. cash gives you somehow a 'cheat'  technical contains bugs and isnt state-of-the-art.

7954	0	a	  Unfortunately, the community has become more cancerous than you can imagine. Kabam gives no ♥♥♥♥s about cheating, scamming, pay-to-win unfairness, level-grinding bots, the community's every-man-for-himself strategy when facing Oryx, or message/advertisement flooding by spam accounts. Seriously, join the server called 'USWest3' and count the number of spam accounts you see before you lose connection.  If you think this is Kabam's first screw-up, send a bug report to the tech support of 'Kingdoms of Camelot: Battle for the North,' and count the weeks before they reply with no recollection of what you stated in your report.  With all of that noted, it's a fun way to waste time at school.

7958	0	a	This gam is veri meen. You start as a Yoshi in a beaten down town called dallas. The first thing that happens i dont know, i got too scared to watch but then they get tons of guns and steal all the banks hard earned cash. Then mario drops through the pipes into the lounge room and say 'freeze scum' then the yoshi and his backup kirbies shoot him in the ♥♥♥♥. They then run away wid the cash. Then i got scared again and dont know what happens next. Next time i think they should have more pamela anderson in this platformer, terraria remake and possibly use less keks and sp00ks. i'd give 7/4 - IGN approved!
7959	0	a	okay this game is absolute trash, i cant even play the game, each time i click on something the game darkens and i cant press anything to make it work  -10/10
7960	0	a	This game...Was better two years ago... I guess games like this get worse with age? Might be good if you want to quickly go in and kill stuff. Probably not the best game anymore for that though,
7961	0	a	Look, i've played this game for countless years, Game is filled with exploits, the new devs known as DECA are more money hungry than the previous companies. The game is not the problem, it's fun. It's the devs of the game, everything new put in the game is pay to win, all positive reviews are also fakes due to them again selling out and giving every player a single item, keep in mind none of the items given were rare items. If you want to try the game go ahead, but i do not recommend getting to indepth with it until a company that actually isn't money hungry takes over the game. I know i'll be taking a long break until something happens to the P2W side which is soon going to turn into P2P (pay to play).  Overall: The game is addicting, and fun, my hours can tell a lot about that. But the game is changing, as all games do, but not in a good way, it's heading to a bad place from what i've been seeing lately.
7962	0	a	This game was a terrible, cluttered mess when it first came out. Boring as all hell unless you like grinding. And I dont mean fun grinding, I mean like playing the Cookie Clicker game grinding. It was a mind-numbingly boring timesink at best and a carpal tunnel generator at worst.  And now apparently a new developer owns it and its pay-to-win on top of being bad.     Apparently it is possible to make a bad game worse. Who knew!
7963	0	a	I used to adore this game when it first came to Steam. I was always suggesting it to people, made a group and was playing around with different classes and equipment. The odd person in my gaming group even spent a little 'real life' money on the game.   Then, after a while, it went down hill. Between people multiboxing, selling items via Paypal for 'real world' cash and the game changes it had become 'pay2win.'  You were always able to buy 'starting' items... but high tier stuff is just insane. In the end the game became unplayable for those with the starting weapons.  Buy making it so heavily 'pay2win' I uninstalled. I will no longer be recommending this game to anyone I know.  I enjoyed the game so much I was considering buying things in game, I was just trying to work out what I wanted. I couldn't decide between an extra character space or storage space. As it stands I'm glad I didn't put any money into this game.  I really hope that this game becomes more balanced.

7967	0	a	It is a good game. Nice graphics and storylines. But there's one thing that I would really like to complain. 'Quality'. The graphics quality is a huge problem to me because we need to switch it to Low, Medium, and High. But I cant switch it to medium which is causing a really bad lag problem for a Low-End Laptops like me. It's ok in my PC but I would really like to play this in my laptop. I'm really sorry but I can't recommend this to other's unless you update it and add the quality settings.

7969	0	a	Extremely boring. I ran around with 3 or 4 different characters dieing a few times and exploring. Then I realized that there was nothing else to the game. Litterally all you do is walk around forever, hold down left trigger to shoot enemies and level up to 20. After that you go fight bigger stuff but the gameplay doesnt change. Shoot badguys, find new badguys, repeat.
7970	0	a	theres alot of people online and i never really felt it was that amazing
7971	0	a	♥♥♥♥in Kabam came over and whacked wild shadow in the gabber and started charging way too much money for this game. It used to be good but now it is overwhelmed with bugs that could have been fixed years ago but all they want is money as they bring out some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ pack each week instead of focusing on game breaking bugs.
7972	0	a	This game ruined my life do not play it.
7973	0	a	Free to pay win game.
7974	0	a	Free to play accounts extremely limited. In game items are too expensive to justify, considering it's permadeath feature.  Examples:  ($10) 1000 Gold for a different character slot. What if I don't want to use my super OP character and just fool around for a bit? 10 ♥♥♥♥ing dollars.  ($5) 500 Gold for 8 extra storage spaces.  ($1) 100 Gold for a dungeon key. Which is over in a couple of minutes.  200-800 Gold for top tier weapons/armor/abilities. That can be lost because durr permadeath.  'Why don't you go to 3rd party sites to buy armor/potions?' The prices aren't as cheap as I'd like still, and there's the (albeit unlikely) possibility of it being a scam website. (I'd just do more research into the websites themselves). I've seen prices between $30 and $70 for a maxed out character, which is odd, considering that they should be the same items for the character.  Last Complaint: You can't transfer your old account to the steam account, so prepare to start fresh.

7976	0	a	I played this back in 2014-ish and at the time this game was fun for a few hours then eventually got stale afterwards. So, after 3 years has this game improved? I can't tell much of a difference between 2014 and now, the game is still fun and I really enjoy the base game...But there just isn't much to it other than the combat and guilds. No expansions, no new classes from what I can tell, no further RPG depth added to it. It's basically the same bullet hell MMO I played back in 2014.  Oh, and everything costs real money. This might have already been a thing and I just don't remember, but it's still a lazy business model regardless. The game appears to have been bought out by a company named Kabam. Here is what I have gathered from my search:   Kabam (formerly Watercooler, Inc.) is an interactive entertainment company founded in 2006 and headquartered in San Francisco, CA. with offices in Beijing, Vancouver, Los Angeles, and Austin, Texas. The company creates, develops and publishes massively multiplayer social games (MMSG’s) such as Kingdoms of Camelot, Star Wars: Uprising and Marvel: Contest of Champions for mobile devices. Before expanding into gaming, Kabam established itself as a social applications developer with entertainment and sports communities totaling more than 60 million users. Kabam markets freemium games for mobile devices, and social networking services,. The company's investors include Alibaba, Canaan Partners, Google, MGM, Intel, Pinnacle Ventures, Redpoint Ventures, Warner Bros. and others.  The company has focused on developing 'real games,' or games with immersive gameplay mechanics akin to more traditional MMOs with an emphasis on the spending and gambling of virtual currency. In late 2009, Kabam launched Kingdoms of Camelot, one of the first successful strategy games on Facebook, but in June 2010, the number of players began constantly shrinking.[1]  As of April 2015, Kabam has announced a shift in its focus to developing AAA mobile games.[2] Source:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabam   The information above should give you a good idea who you are dealing with if you plan to shell out cash.   And yes, you can unlock classes for free, and I honestly don't mind how the current class unlock system works. You level your starting character to 20 which will then give you access to the next class. You can continue with the current starting class and gain fame, or kill him/her off to get access to the character you just unlocked. Now that right there is what I have a problem with. You cannot keep your character, you either have to buy a new slot with money or kill them off (they deleted my maxed out wizard when I got back, the only thing I had left was my level 8 Warrior). 2 slots to start off with I think would have been reasonable, but after seeing the terrible business model here and Kabam's history, these give off the impression of a very desperate company. Which could spell out the doom for Realm of the Mad God.  TL;DR: Other than the ignorant company behind this game, there really isn't much to talk about. RMG is a very generic free to play game that's fun with friends for a couple days and will run on a potato without any problems. However the servers are crap so be prepared to die a lot more to lag than the monsters you are fighting. My verdict? 6/10. It has something you could definitely build on but due to the nature of the situation this game is currently in I doubt you will see much in the way of future content.
7977	0	a	  Its cheap, hard to control, and is full of micro transactions.
7978	0	a	The game was really good until Kabam screwed it up.  curse you kabam.
7979	0	a	I would love this game so much if only I could CONTROL IT! Seriously! Im not sure if its just me but everytime I play this game I can control my character for a minute then for whatever reason I no longer control my character. My character just goes where ever the ♥♥♥♥ which often ends with death making it impossible to proceed to the next class in this game. They need to fix this because at the moment its impossible to play. Until this is fixed this isnt getting any thumbs up from me.

7981	0	a	When you reach a certin point in the game where you would consider yourself to be a good player you WILL die. After you die all the time you spent playing you will feel like you wasted your time playing this stupid game. There is no clear goal to the game.

7990	0	a	Alright, I had a sort of joke review for this game before, but I think I should give it a bit more of a genuine response.  Let me start by saying that I have a few friends (who shall remain nameless) who really like the game. They played it way back when they were younger and they still play once and a while to this day.  However I didn't find out about this game 'till I was much older. So, as a new player, I found the game very easy to understand, and the gameplay is very straight forward. It's basically Rogue-like, MMO, Bullet-hell. Simple concept, interesting idea, and in a lot of ways, I can respect that.  Now, as for my experience with the game, it was actually sort of fun just starting out. However once you start getting to the late-game, it just becomes a really stressful chore. At that point the game becomes significantly less enjoyable (at least for me anyway). But as I said before there are rogue-like elements to the game, you can save equipment between deaths if you store it in your bank before you die. Unfortunately though there aren't any traditional rogue-like elements to give you any form of permanent upgrades between lives. So unless you've stashed away equipment, every single death starts you back at square one, no matter what. Which (again, for me) creates a very unenjoyable experience as it can be so stressful and frustrating to have so much progress undone with a single mistake, or to have absolutely nothing to show for all of your playtime.  One more thing I'd like to mention on the more objective side of things. I have noticed that even on some more beefed up computers, the game still chugs from time to time, which makes the game that much more unenjoyable to play.  Once more I'd like to reiterate, this review is mostly my own personal problems with the game, but my final consensus would be that this game is really dated, and most of the people who actually like the game just have nostalgia goggles for it. Basically, it's not outright the worst game ever, but if you didn't grow up with this game, you're probably going to have a hard time getting into it, just as with something like say, Runescape.

7995	0	a	♥♥♥♥ing sucks balls wtf
7996	0	a	The actual game is way too simple, boring, kind of unoriginal, and it looks like it was made by an intern still in his/her teens. I mean, seriously, what you can get out of this game is a bunch of large pixels put together to make a game. The gameplay is fair, exciting, I suppose. You get overpowered fast, which is when the game starts to get boring. Really, really boring.  But cutting to the chase here is what I don't like about this game. The cash-demanding in-game items. Now, I've always heard that when you buy a membership for a game or something along the lines of that, you're paying for pixels. I always disregarded those opinions, even though I don't always have memberships, and just shook it off considering the game's fun. This is an exception, why? Because this game is literally a few pixels.  But wait, graphics aren't the ones that make a game, right? Exactly. Which is why I'm getting to the bigger chase. Anyway, I picked warrior for this class, expecting a badass armored guy with powerful melee attacks and such. What do I get? I get an armored guy, check. I get a sword, check. I get super-awesome melee attacks, NO. NO NO NO NO NO NO. This game HAS SOMETHING EVEN BETTER!!! Want to know what that is?!  You point your sword somewhere and a 2-pixel beam comes out of it and the enemy dies, good job. This game is so easy and gets easier as you progress. Then you die by something I can't exactly make out become of how pixelated and undetailed (if that's even a word) this game is. Yaaay?  This game's sound is what's half the icing on the cake. (The other half I probably ate already. Probably). The game blasts your face with the same god♥♥♥♥ingforsaken♥♥♥♥ingloop of all time. I mean, can't the lobby have something else besides the same ♥♥♥♥ing tune I have to ♥♥♥♥ing sit through every ♥♥♥♥ing day? Unfortunately, at the time of playing this game, I haven't made out the 'mute' button. This game's actual sound. Kill a parrot? BLEAUGH. A middle age man. Going 'BLEAUGH'. I get the fact that parrots recognize voices and repeat them, but is this game's realism engine so good that its parrots literally play back what middle-aged men say?! Apparently so. But in reality, it's just flat-out laziness.  Pros: - Gets you hyped, I guess - 'Different' gameplay - Addictive  Cons: - This game hustles money out of you like a really pressurizing marketer that wants me to buy something that would have little to no relevance in my life. I mean seriously, I've heard people complain that I've been buying pixels, but this is just absolutely ridiculous. - Lazy gameplay and artwork. I mean, really, come on. If you look at that one picture in the front where the 'play' button is located, you'll expect a badass game exploring dungeons and ♥♥♥♥. What you get is the outdoors, shooting bullet-lazors at enemies until they make a 'bleaugh' sound of a middle-aged man. - There's nothing that directly appealed to me as a course of the actual game. But, hey, it's free to play, right? - Want to earn a super-cool class that takes years of work? Go for it, if you're determined. ORRR just pay us some money and you'll get it for absolutely free, expecting a very cool new class with everything different, but you just get a man shooting laser-bullets out of his ♥♥♥♥ing sword. This game is PAY TO WIN - I haven't even mentioned this (dunno why), but what exactly is the story, if there is one?!  In conclusion, the game would be fun if the devs spent a little more time on NOT BEING GREEDY AS HELL. 2.5/10
7997	0	a	Awful. Just ♥♥♥♥ing awful.

7999	0	a	this game is fun but i have to put down on this, i do enjoy the game but the whole pay to get things in a PERMA-DEATH rouge game seems something short of maddness, insanity, neglagence, and redaradtion it should not have been i would give a thumbs up to the games mech. and great use of a rouge elements but surosly? buying items that may NEVER prove any use to you because you can get better thing naturaly AND you WILL DIE AND WASTED YOUR MONEY because its perma death you LOSE EVERYTHING. its like if you had an option to buy a ticket that makes you 5% faster but got killed and lost it you respawn and IT IS gone no refunds NOTHING thats it because it was taked on like some bubble gum on a leaking roof.

8011	0	a	There's really no main objective to this game, i've been fourtunate to play with people who can carry me and sometimes give me free items, but i don't find it fun, and if you solo this game, it's going to be worse. This game isn't cheap if you want to get decently good, the prices of this game aren't fair from my pov, considering you have to pay 500 gold for 1 chest which holds 8 slots for like 6$ CND. It was fun for awhile because you explore the classes and dungeons, but after that it's the same. If you don't mind spending a whole lot of money to have multiple charcters, pets, chest slots, then i guess it'll be fun, but if you're not going to spend any money, i wouldnt expect more than 200 hours on this game.

This game is disgusting and I do not recommend it at all. Thankfully it is free, so I didn't have to waste my money on this garbage.

I decided to head onto the game myself to see the so called Pay-2-Win, as soon as I loaded up the game: A FANTASTIC OFFER FOR -random ♥♥♥♥ that takes 500 hours to get- ONLY £9  Ridiculous. KABAM ruined this game.
8020	0	a	Don't even bother, just thinking about what this game represents makes me sick to my stomach. It may have had a salvageable concept in it before it was converted to a money pit, but even then it was less fun than drawing in Paint. It has only gone downhill from there, due to a complete change of owners and design philosophy.  Expect a frustrating, grindy, low drop-rate, laggy, dungeon crawler with inconsistent, one-shotting, unfair monsters that move at the land speed record and a gigantic money grab store full of temporary, easily lost items best described as pay to advance, since any significant character gear evolution past the first 20 minutes is minimized to a 1 in 10000 chance of a drop from a monster that can and will insta-kill you.  Spending more than a few paragraphs reviewing this 'game' would only serve to validate it. Disgusting from start to finish.

8026	0	a	Sad to say but this game is now 'dead' i advise new players to not spend money on it (unless you're a rich C3NT) otherwise don't waste your money on it because KABAM is never going to update the game ( no new ♥♥♥♥ ) it will stay like this FOREVER. If you're playing for fun than i guess it's fine but once u get gud at the game and there are no more goals for you to reach, you will eventually quit and think ' why did i waste my time on this dead game' Some of the reasons you will hate this game are:  - Severe game balancing issues! Land tons of damage with one class and steal loot from other poor useless players! - No serious updates in years! You can play the same dungeons again, and again and again! And then some more!  - Rampant cheating! And if this doesn't still sell this to you, also know that the company now managing the game, the infamous Kabam, totally ignores cheater reports! - Poisonous community! Scammers? We got those! Leechers? Of course, the game actually encourages leeching! Racial and homophobic insults? Goes without saying! - Pay to win!!! You think you can max your pet without spending real money? Think again!!! And if you don't feel like buying game gold, just check out the black market spambots that make the game chat window completely unusable! - Much, much more!  However iv'e been playing this game for almost 3 years and it's still fun (at times) what keeps me going on this game is  1. The Goals i want to achieve ( White star, Seal of Blas , Rich ,10K BaseFame ) 2. Friends in game ( TayBS , Zenoren ) 3. Guilds ( WolfArmy ) Well i guess that's all i can say for now. The choice is all up to you whether to play or not to play this game. Hope this review helped you to understand realm a little ( and me :3 )  All the best to New and Old players! -Rockya

8028	0	a	sure itsfun but its insanely frustrating and sometimes the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t deaths from lag and even just the game saying ♥♥♥♥ you really really ♥♥♥♥IN SUCK
8029	0	a	Great game to waste pointless time... Rating: 2/10
8030	0	a	used to be a good game until they made it pay2win. now is even more trash than my butterfly knife
8031	0	a	sure itsfun but its insanely frustrating and sometimes the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t deaths from lag and even just the game saying ♥♥♥♥ you really really ♥♥♥♥IN SUCK
8032	0	a	I mean yeah, it's fun and all that but.  1) Make an account.  2) Die in game.  3) Be sad, because you lost everything  4) Top up your steam account  5) Buy good 32k gold  6) Be pro.
8033	0	a	Kabam, Why don't you give up, you lost, Let wild shadow have their game back instead of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ our bank accounts...
8034	0	a	The graphics and music are  ♥♥♥♥  (I know its meant to be 8 bit n stuff but they could of put alot more effort it sometimes you cant tell which item is which).The music just repeats and gets  really  distracting i ened up turning it off. The camera angle are also pretty  ♥♥♥♥y  because enemies you cant see shoot you so you have to walk towards the bullets or whatever and take more damage before you actually kill them. You can rotate the camera but it doesnt really help much and is a bit disoreentating. I really do find it amazing that some of my skype/steam/irl friends shelled out real money for this  peice of ♥♥♥♥   My friends told me that they also found it boring in the first stages so i decided to play it for  4 ♥♥♥♥ing hours ,4 hours ill never get back mind you because i got to level 16-20 which is pretty high and still couldnt find any interest in it. In my opinion the reason hotline miami was so succesfull and popular is because it deems a challenge to the player,persuasion to go on and beat the enemys as if to say 'No ♥♥♥♥ you devs im beating this game'...Well this ♥♥♥♥♥torm of flying orbitals and partical effects has none of that and hands you easy after easier bosses one after another.There is no challenge and no reason to play the game.  Another, dare i say  feature  in this game is to press the R key (which brings you back to a spawn location called 'The Nexus') which not only is just making the game too easy again, it doesnt actually ♥♥♥♥ing work.It works if you are in less crowded spaces but if you go into a heaped Dungeon or Snake pit it takes a while to respond and by the time it does chances are youre allready dead.   Boring as ♥♥♥♥  friends kept forcing me to play it  4/10 
8035	0	a	why is it everytime i die i have to restart?
8036	0	a	Was fun when I used to play it on Kongregate.   WHEN I COULD ACTUALLY LOOT GRAVES  YEAH, TOO BAD YA CAN'T DO THAT ANYMORE  Kabam truly made this game what it is today. ♥♥♥♥
8037	0	a	Don't get the wrong idea, I really love the game, but kabam kinda ruined it. I still like playing the game, but it's so hard to actually progress after you get to level 20. I try and try again to get permanent upgrade potions, but to no avail. I only gotten one through trading during the whole 75 hours I've played. Which to me isn't worth doing.

8042	0	a	I see the nice idea behind it but you WONT get anywhere without making ingame purchases, really its just another pay to win and I really dont recommend it.

8054	0	a	g8 game I r8 8/8 cuz it's totally not pay 2 win!!!!! kudos to the company!!! masterpiece geme
8055	0	a	look guys i want to love this game it is sooo much fun but it feels so pay to win for instance i renamed my charachter to champoin. now not my misspelling of charecter. as you can see i cant spell but the game wants me to give it 10 american dollars just to change that. now it is a great game but your always being bombarded with the game asking for money. now i can almost see buying a weapon but when you die it drops and you never can get it back. so pretty much you just set money on fire. and might i add some weapons are $5. look if you want to be constanly bombarded with the game begging for money go ahead but i dont recommend it. there are very simmilar games like this that do not ask for money ever. if you want a inteanse mmo were you are always fighting with no down time that dosent ask for money go play path of exile a free alteritive. or hammerwatch a paid game that is probobly this game on steirods but dont play this game.
8056	0	a	WOW KABAM MADE THIS GAME GREAT! I love all the hackers, the people who are pay to win, and the best wepon a credit card. kabam you took a big&amp; *&amp;*@ on this
8057	0	a	5/5
8058	0	a	This game is filled with bugs and garbage. The realms are overcrowded and the players are hostile to each other even though this is a coop game. To get farther ahead you have to pay. Garbage. 2/10
8059	0	a	Realm of the mad god is a interesting game, for a F2P game i'd say its not all that bad, like most F2P games though its absolutely littered with pay to win features, the lobbies are also filled with third party item sellers that are not being dealt with at all. A big issue with Realm of the mad god is its extremely unstable, the webclient seems to work not bad but the steam version seems to entirely stop working at times. Over all, fun addicting gameplay, good way to waste a couple hours but terribly unstable and absolutely filled with pay to win features. 4/10
8060	0	a	This game used to be fun, but than Kabam bought it. It is the worst thing imaginiable now.  100% Pay to win.
8061	0	a	The EA of all Steam games.
8062	0	a	mad god makes mad bank from all the ingame purchases
8063	0	a	3 Words. Kabam ruined this
8064	0	a	Enless you hack or dupe it is really hard to get good for new players, i honstly don't recommend this game.
8065	0	a	Performs ♥♥♥♥ing horrible, Always bad ping, frame lag, even with gtx660. for such a simple game, this should work 20000000000x bettert than it really does.
8066	0	a	no control somtines,dont get it,one of the 2nd worst games ive played D: 
8067	0	a	When you open the game first time, you will notice the big ad saying 'BUY 'X' COINS!. ONLY 6/0$ | 20$!' I closed the ad and said 'K, let's check the game itself'. So I was playing and I got kicked out of the game. I asked my friend 'wtf is this?' he told me that it's a 'famous' lag. After half hour, the game started to work again. I went to the dungeon and everything I did is spam WASD and Left-Click. This is so pointless. The game is laggy and a wind can kill you (Wind = Lag). After me dying once, I started walking on the safe-zone. First thing I noticed was a shop, selling top tier gear for premium coins. If you want a crappy, laggy, pointless, p2w mmo 'rpg', ROTMG is the choice for you. I'm putting 1/10 because it's the worst game ever made.  Also the game developers hacked their own game only to get more donations, wich is a completly crime.
8068	0	a	Microtransactions, bad servers
8069	0	a	Fun for the first hour, got bored and went and played something else. You can't earn money, you have to buy through microtransactions, and that is the only way of buying items, the only other way of getting them is to loot them off of monsters and 99% of the time you get loot that's either worse, or unusable by your class.
8070	0	a	it was a good game from before- its now dead no1 can be seen anywhere in realm!
8071	0	a	not enuff weed.
8072	0	a	The game eats too much of my hard drive.  It  was  a great game. But Kabam ruined it. Wellplayed.
8073	0	a	this is ♥♥♥♥ing stupid I reach level 20 with really good ♥♥♥♥ and I get one hit by a tree. WTF
8074	0	a	i Dont Recommend this game, i can't play this game. very badful and very ♥♥♥♥ing bad. The peoples who are 8+ages play this game. 0/10
8075	0	a	not enuff weed.
8076	0	a	why
8077	0	a	This is actually an ok game. I have hundreds of hours on the browser. But, no. NEVER AGAIN. GRIND AND GRIND AND GRIND AND- Sorry, im getting a bit emotional. Me and my freinds refuse to say it's name. We call it 'That game from hell' and 'That game we don't talk about'. Never again. Do not install if you don't want to ruin your life.
8078	0	a	WARNING PERMA DEATH YOU SPEN MONEY YOU DIE ITS ALL GONE NO POINT PLAYING NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO SO MUCH LAG WORST GAME EVER
8079	0	a	Apparently the inbrowser version that can be found at  http://www.kongregate.com/games/Wild_Shadow/realm-of-the-mad-god  is more functional than the Steam version. (at least for me) Upon opening the game, if I even get past the loading screen, I'm prompted to login before I can play. However, clicking the 'new user' button does nothing. I registered an account on the in browser version in hopes to link my steam account to my browser one since I had a lot of gear from the last time I played (over a year ago), but again, clicking the sign in button doesn't work. Despite this game being free to play, I've heard it's now pay to win. I can't reccommend a game that doesn't even have functioning buttons that is more of a shop than a game. 0/10
8080	0	a	Repetitive.  A somehwat fast paced pixel game. It is good entertainmnet...for the first twenty minutes. The constant level grindng is annoying and unneeded, and once you've grinded to twenty, you can wste more time attacking bosses that poorly resemble greek gods. The music is one thing i dont mind about it, it is a catchy, looping playlist. The relm coins are somthing more, they cost an arm and a leg, as yeild low rewards, you can buy some of the weapons and armor, only to go out into the world and die within three seconds, loosing all of the items you purchased, and forcing you to restart.
8081	0	a	trust me , JUST NOT WORTH IT.
8082	0	a	The actual game is way too simple, boring, kind of unoriginal, and it looks like it was made by an intern still in his/her teens. I mean, seriously, what you can get out of this game is a bunch of large pixels put together to make a game. The gameplay is fair, exciting, I suppose. You get overpowered fast, which is when the game starts to get boring. Really, really boring.  But cutting to the chase here is what I don't like about this game. The cash-demanding in-game items. Now, I've always heard that when you buy a membership for a game or something along the lines of that, you're paying for pixels. I always disregarded those opinions, even though I don't always have memberships, and just shook it off considering the game's fun. This is an exception, why? Because this game is literally a few pixels.  But wait, graphics aren't the ones that make a game, right? Exactly. Which is why I'm getting to the bigger chase. Anyway, I picked warrior for this class, expecting a badass armored guy with powerful melee attacks and such. What do I get? I get an armored guy, check. I get a sword, check. I get super-awesome melee attacks, NO. NO NO NO NO NO NO. This game HAS SOMETHING EVEN BETTER!!! Want to know what that is?!  You point your sword somewhere and a 2-pixel beam comes out of it and the enemy dies, good job. This game is so easy and gets easier as you progress. Then you die by something I can't exactly make out become of how pixelated and undetailed (if that's even a word) this game is. Yaaay?  This game's sound is what's half the icing on the cake. (The other half I probably ate already. Probably). The game blasts your face with the same god♥♥♥♥ingforsaken♥♥♥♥ingloop of all time. I mean, can't the lobby have something else besides the same ♥♥♥♥ing tune I have to ♥♥♥♥ing sit through every ♥♥♥♥ing day? Unfortunately, at the time of playing this game, I haven't made out the 'mute' button. This game's actual sound. Kill a parrot? BLEAUGH. A middle age man. Going 'BLEAUGH'. I get the fact that parrots recognize voices and repeat them, but is this game's realism engine so good that its parrots literally play back what middle-aged men say?! Apparently so. But in reality, it's just flat-out laziness.  Pros: - Gets you hyped, I guess - 'Different' gameplay - Addictive  Cons: - This game hustles money out of you like a really pressurizing marketer that wants me to buy something that would have little to no relevance in my life. I mean seriously, I've heard people complain that I've been buying pixels, but this is just absolutely ridiculous. - Lazy gameplay and artwork. I mean, really, come on. If you look at that one picture in the front where the 'play' button is located, you'll expect a badass game exploring dungeons and ♥♥♥♥. What you get is the outdoors, shooting bullet-lazors at enemies until they make a 'bleaugh' sound of a middle-aged man. - There's nothing that directly appealed to me as a course of the actual game. But, hey, it's free to play, right? - Want to earn a super-cool class that takes years of work? Go for it, if you're determined. ORRR just pay us some money and you'll get it for absolutely free, expecting a very cool new class with everything different, but you just get a man shooting laser-bullets out of his ♥♥♥♥ing sword. This game is PAY TO WIN - I haven't even mentioned this (dunno why), but what exactly is the story, if there is one?!  In conclusion, the game would be fun if the devs spent a little more time on NOT BEING GREEDY AS HELL. 2.5/10
8083	0	a	Awful. Just ♥♥♥♥ing awful.
8084	0	a	I learnt where to buy Dilldos, Condoms, some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ pirated DVDs and f***** Viagra from this game. There is also a really hot girl called Britney who lives in my area and wants to meet up, aren't I a lucky guy! I'm not sure if this is an actual game or just a group of autistic spam bots telling me that horny b****** wanna F***in my area.  And if you expect your half-witted friends to understand you in that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of a spawn, then you are very mistaken.  So if you're looking for advertisment sex sim 2, then this is your game. Enjoy, Half-Wit.
8085	0	a	My bad-game senses are tingling!
8086	0	a	For some reason my game wouldn't work When its says Loading... an error has occured saying ''Index Out Of Range'' I didn't know how to fix it, in other words any help?
8087	0	a	You rarely get the items that you need. I mean, I seriously had a t0 poison until lvl 20 (I play at the rotmg site). And finally when getting great items and dieing, you don't want to play the game because your character seems like a weak snail. I want to also mention the alchemist remember when it was actually GOOD? Completing quests was a good idea to get better loot and sometimes a dye or something else. But then they changed the quests to give you useless transformation and ok loot potions. And worst of all to get the points to spend on the alchemist you have to get tarot cards. Yeah, good luck getting them without any powerful items and ultimate luck. Actually the pay to win of this game is a lot worse. Before, you could get stuff with FAME. Like the ammy, remember that? Well, then they changed it to the cursed amulet of ressurection to the cusred amulet of zombification.Just why? Now fame is almost worthless, only to feed your pet and make a guild. And theres a review that says:'This is a bonkers top-down shooter MMO that bucks typical MMO conventions. Death has real consequences and the 30+ classes are unlocked as you go.' Now what are these 30+ characters? There are only 14 characters. All i can say about this game at this point is that the title is supposed to say: Realm Of The Mad Shop.
8088	0	a	Well, it was good when it was actually free.
8089	0	a	you should fix the bug where it can't boot up i had to delete the game and i am waiting for the next update 
8090	0	a	There's a reason why I've only played 2.4 hours
8091	0	a	this game is fun but i have to put down on this, i do enjoy the game but the whole pay to get things in a PERMA-DEATH rouge game seems something short of maddness, insanity, neglagence, and redaradtion it should not have been i would give a thumbs up to the games mech. and great use of a rouge elements but surosly? buying items that may NEVER prove any use to you because you can get better thing naturaly AND you WILL DIE AND WASTED YOUR MONEY because its perma death you LOSE EVERYTHING. its like if you had an option to buy a ticket that makes you 5% faster but got killed and lost it you respawn and IT IS gone no refunds NOTHING thats it because it was taked on like some bubble gum on a leaking roof.
8092	0	a	being a jew + game with lots of microtransacctions = bad game
8093	0	a	Where to begin with this minitransaction piece of ♥♥♥♥....  Well, its a free2play *cough* pay2win *cough* perma-death rogue-like mmo bullet hell... I'll give them a A+ for the creativity, but really? you can just go find all the different spices you like and make a salsa. same with games you can't find all the genres you like and make a game. perma-death rogue-like bullet hell, to genres that in all honestly are fun on there own, but they dont mix well, like water and oil. they are madding at there best together, and suicudly evil at there worst. oh and the fact that ITS A MMO, YOU KNOW THE GAMES WHERE YOU GROW ATTACHED TO THE CHARCATER YOU PLAY! god... oh and the minitransactions, dont get me started with you. the perma-death 'feature' making it extremly temthing to buy items. if they won't $5 for a basic item.... in short or in fact for that matter a TL;DR version of it   TL;DR edition  Minitransaction laced rogue-like mmo with rogue-like 'features'  I give it a Minitransaction/10
8094	0	a	Pay to win as ♥♥♥♥
8095	0	a	It's an awesome and addicting game. But due to it getting hacked a lot.. I'm going to have to say that I wouldn't really recommend it. Not only that but it's becoming a P2W (Pay to win) game now.
8096	0	a	Played it for 30 minutes straight. Then I died, after I was randomly teleported to the Castle of the Mad God, losing all of my stuff.  ARE YOU KIDDING ME!? And when I go to the Nexus, Despite them giving you 40 crap coins, you can't buy anything other than skin mystery box.  Great game for uninstalling.
8097	0	a	This game just plain sucks....'free to play' more like 'pay to play' because you have no damn currency and it's the same song over and over again. This game really does suck.
8098	0	a	Cool concept, but its the most pay2win game I have ever seen.
8099	0	a	This actually might be the worst game to ever exist, I would recommend go playing with you're own ♥♥♥♥ than playing this game! I have 4.4 hrs of friends forcing me to play this cancer.
8100	0	a	after 62 hours of playing, it deletes my account.   pure pearmadeath game.   gg no re.
8101	0	a	OH MY GOD !!!!!1 I GOT 301289312893 COINS ..... then ....... *dies*............................. wat a waste of money ._.
8102	0	a	This was an amazing game of skill and luck... You start at level 1 and you can reach level 20 within 40-60 minutes. Once you reach that the goal was to kill the level 20 monsters in the middle to increase your overall stats.  Slowly increasing your gear from exploring dungeons and killing monsters you can eventually reach end game. If you haven't played the game before. Go ahead and play your heart out. Just beware this game advertises items in the spawn so you are more likely to buy those items. This is the worst type of paying to win. Don't buy anything (as it is more like a rental as you can't keep everything) [Except pets in a vault]
8103	0	a	You die to much.     '11/10 reason...' ~IGN          P.S. Play this game, get killed to much.
8104	0	a	it's a good game but unless you have a beefy computer the lag makes it unplayable.
8105	0	a	This game was the ♥♥♥♥...back then. The F2P dream is over gentlemen, all hail P2W.
8106	0	a	Very boring, yet utterly annoying Roguelike MMORPG. Holy ♥♥♥♥ I hate it.  All you do is going through Grinding Hell by shooting things until finally battling the final boss of sort, Oryx, all while praying that the enemies just don't drain all of your life in one second (which happened to me a lot). It bears repeating, that's literally all you do, nothing glamorous at all, little to no variety, you just shoot things, it's boring as hell, my god.  **In-depth mode, GO** You could argue that fighting multiplying cats and then hordes of dwarves leads to different situations, which may be true, yeah, but Jesus Christ, there's no way, nor a reason, to use different strategies, it all boils down to aim at some blocky piece of crap and avoiding its pellets until it's gone, hoping there isn't a clown car full of unnecessary roadblocks offscreen, trying to ambush you.  There are classes to unlock, but whenever a game has multiple characters to choose from, they better have heavily different abilities to be worthwhile, and not just a carbon copy of each other. And guess what? They all pretty much act the same way, they all shoot some arrow/spell, and the only real differences being the statistics, and they have a different special move, which may change their playstyle, but not by much. You're locked to a class until its inevitable end as well, so you can't alter the experience ever so slightly without having to die. Such a worthless feature.  There may be Pets, and they may useful, but they don't deepen the experience much either. You can't do some crazy chemistry like Palicoes or somethin, it's either they attack or they heal you, and you need Fame (or real money) to feed them stuff and fusing them, Fame is the only 'free' form of money that you get by, again, Grinding Helling these, and then dying, meh...  Since it's a roguelike, if you die, you lose your character for good, but the problem is that you don't just lose about an hour of gameplay, oh noooo, your 'oh-so-many' days character can just be gone due to some organized gangrape, where all the wildlife decided to all rush and shoot at you from offscreen, without any warning despite the map pinpointing them, and you have to start everything from scratch. Geez, who the ♥♥♥♥ likes to lose so much (non-)progress? I mourned more over my dead 10 hours character than on my grandma, knowing that I have to bore myself to death again. I also find it hard to imagine that you have to not be messing up at all for many hours straight, like some MLG god, seems too hardcore even for difficulty.  And YES, I know of the Nexus Key, where you can go back to the peaceful lobby by the press of a button, but that is no excuse for poorly designed difficulty. If some Cthulu wannabe with its Golem orgy decided to rush at you, you can't save your sweet rear with skill, without wussing out. That's not good gameplay.  'But dude, you just suck at the game, it's the point to die and start all over.' Oh yeah sure, I could have gotten better, there is after all leveling to do and better equipment to get, like any self-respecting RPGs, but do you REALLY want to know how you do that?  Shooting things nets you experience points, but you can only go as far as Lv 20, which is still not high enough to confront the gods. So what do you do then? Get better equipment by defeating bosses, however it's completely random what they drop, more often than not they drop stuff for other classes, which your current class can't wield, completely useless. I don't care if I can save these items in the Vault for future runs, as I want better crap for THIS character, it's utterly poor RNG, and even then, what would I do with an UT Skull if I don't also happen to have a good defense item to wanting to use it without dying in the process?  If all else fails, you then have to kill gods, which went 'great', or venture through dungeons to find pots that only ups one puny points in your statistics, but these only appear 1/10 times. 'But... but you're only doing low-tiered dungeons, I always get a pot in more difficult ones!' Okay, harder dungeons may have better chances to give you pots, but I always got Speed due to crappy luck, again, and as for the other dungeons, you know what I needed to get first in order to not die in those harder hellholes? More pots, so it's just a vicious cycle, good job to the clowns who programmed this ant maze.  Keep in mind that, if you ever die, which you will, you'd have to do all this again. Leveling to 20 isn't THAT awful, and you don't lose pets, but all the equipment and these freaking pots, gone. Reason why I'm grudging so much over that is that, again, I get killed by stuff flying straight at me, with no time to react, it's the cheapest damn death that happened to me way too often, even when I was reasonnably well equipped and mostly cautious.  Given, I'm playing solely solo, and the game advertises multiplayer, so it then makes sense that monsters drop stuff for your teammates, but I'm getting the shaft just because I'm going at my pace, it doesn't support both these playstyles. Plus, it turns out that certain monsters can in fact consistently drop a type of weapon, but good luck finding whichever you need to kill without a walkthrough, and the game doesn't really help you either, as the quests it gives you to level up are always the same for everyone, a wasted opportunity. It would've been so much better if these earlier quests were specific to your class, would make sense for an archer to hunt woodland creatures, so then you'd get stuff you can actually wield.  I swear, I grinded for many, MANY unholy succubus-fisting hours, spreaded throughout days, killing gods, and yet my equipment and stats were still too crap to deal with the quest monsters, and I got wrecked damn hard in the same fashion. I'm completely clueless as to what I'm doing wrong, unless I have to cough up some dollars to get better crap that I assume I'd lose anyway if I would inevitably die.  I guess having redundant grinding could be said for a lot of RPGs, but they at least have deeper mechanics, they offer more options and even playstyles, able to use different strategies, and they have substance, which this game have none of. Simple games can have deep mechanics, but this stupid hump here is not deep, it's simpleminded busywork, heck it feels like my desk job. There isn't ANYTHING else to do, you're at the game's mercy, and it mostly comes out as unrewarding, this is by far one of the worst cases of grinding I've ever seen.  It also features a very grueling, sole music that makes you want to mute it, the stereotypical indie 8 or so-bit graphics because 'retro is cewl!', and, as previously mentionned, there are microstransactions, the pay-to-win and in-your-face kind, of course silly. Heck, you can even ACCIDENTLY BUY a potion if you had none left, in the middle of the action while you're too nervous to notice, with Realm Coins which you can only get more of with real money. I also read that the weapons and dyes for your character that you can also buy with $CAD will be lost upon death. Come on, any game with the slimmest of decency at least lets you keep your bought crap for good.  Utter garbage, tabarnak. I'm pretty sure even before it was bought by whatever current company, I've read, the core gameplay was still and remains just as bad; it's mindnumblingly tedious and the permadeath rule doesn't work at all and is pretty unfair, making things even worse than they already are. My problems aren't necessarly the fact that it has difficulty alone, whatever I like hard games, but losing so much of my time by the sheer stupidity of the game left me very sour, and it goes against all of my principles of good game design, I see nothing redeeming in it.  I want this game to die, horribly. Don't ever waste your time on this crap, you could have a more fun experience throwing rocks in the lake.
8107	0	a	So if your digging though review and are confused about 'Deca' and 'Kabam' well what happened was a perfectly good Rouge like rpg mmo called 'Realm of the mad god' was bought by kabam which turned the game from Fun and easy to 'PAY US OR YOU LOSE 2000 TIMEs!' Then once deca took over they are doing more to fix the game and inprove everything for the play experience. But i do not recommend for one reason... I play this a lot on my schools computers because it is easy to load and play, but then when i come home i want to do the same thing but on steam, but i can't you can't use browser accounts on steam, there is an option to play steam in browser but it has yet to be fixed and proper.  SO this is a must play for mmo rpg players who want a perma death bullet hell... Just not on steam.
8108	0	a	I hate this
8109	0	a	it's a good game but unless you have a beefy computer the lag makes it unplayable.

8111	0	a	A terrible game that eats your life force away as you spend hour after hour farming for gear then losing it all after you die. It's like a bad Direct TV comercial. Don't let your cable go out or you will start playing RotMG, if you start playing RotMG you start raging, when you start raging you get more into RotMG, when you get more into RotMG you get really good, When you get really good you lose everything, when you lose everything you look for a harder game, when you look for a harder game you'll never see daylight again.

8113	0	a	Read the reviews this game is now pay-to-win witch means it is now terrible
8114	0	a	This game is unplayable. The server lag is ridiculous. Also, the in game UI isn't scalled properly, so now I can't even play at all. The ad to buy stuff is almost completely off the screen so I can't click to close it. Obviously, this game is coded like ♥♥♥♥. If you can get this thing to work properly with no lag, it seems like it would be fun.
8115	0	a	great game if you enjoy closing out the game 20+ times in one sitting
8116	0	a	This game has so much gaben in it,  its almost not fun anymore :(

8121	0	a	one of the worst game i have ever played this was a lot better before kabam bought it and ruined it
8122	0	a	Awful game. 1/10 would not play again.
8123	0	a	It is very p2win. As a jobless indivdual, I believe the game should offer some free incentive's to play. While the game is very fun to play, everything cost gold, which can obtained from using money in RL. They give you one vault that you can store 8 item's in then you've to pay for rest. Game is addicting and to anyone without a job or sorce of income to buy stuff this game isn't really for you. I'd still say give it a try though.
8124	0	a	Realm of the Mad God is a GREAT GAME and I would love to play it on Steam but the only problem is that RotMG offers no support for Steam users and no system of migrating an account out of Steam as in the case of a Kabam account. And worst of all, THE GAME DOESN'T EVEN LOAD! For such a popular with a massive fanbase, I would have expected some kind of update from one of only two possible platforms to play the game from. But no! After more than 2 days of not even being able to run the game from Steam there is still no sign of a response from the people behind RotMG. Please fix because trying to run this game through browser or flash projector is a pain, I have to use an alt account, and it is seriously laggy. Thanks and PLEASE FIX.
8125	0	a	Interesting idea, but has fallen to the inevitable chat scammers that every MMO has.  Given the gameplay itself isn't really worth sticking around for, I wouldn't recommend even trying it as of now.  Probably better off doing something productive like taking out the trash or taking a book to read into the bathroom while relieving yourself.  Interesting, but not good/10
8126	0	a	Fun game but ruined by a massive paywall. You only can choose one class and have one chest which severely handicaps your progress, especially as it has permadeath. Would not recommend until they stop being being stingy and money grabbing.

8130	0	a	Disgusting Pay to take a Breath Game.
8131	0	a	Nice gameplay and pixel graphics, but when you die, you lose everything. And if that's not bad enough, the game requires excessive farming that can become boring, and people can steal the loot from your grave. I quit this game last time I was slain.
8132	0	a	Fun game, but broken. Horrible lag in the steam version, and the 'feature' to link your steam account to your web account in order to play on the working browser version doesn't actually work. This has been broken for at least a year, even this long after release.
8133	0	a	You could say I'm glad I didn't spend any more than five quid on microtransactions in this game, and that was just to lessen the shame of having played a 'free to play' game for two hundred hours. Most of the things you buy you will lose on death, so only spend money on things which are permanent, like pet food, and only if you must, because ohhhhh dear Arceus everything is a massive grind. Want a stat pot/slightly rare item? Well, be prepared to do upwards of 200 runs of the same dungeon! It may be satisfying when you do get it, but what do you do then? Let it sit in the vault gathering dust, or die with it?  I pose the question: What's the point?  Yes, it's addicting, but what do you get out of it? Nothing aside from fame - which you spend, so even that isn't permanent, which is stupid - you have to die to pay for things? What kind of messed up system is this?  I only quit because my first max-statted character, a 5/8 warrior that I had trained up for over a year, died because of lag. Fun times.  Still, it was fun while it lasted, though that was only because I was playing it with friends and the banter was pretty top notch.  Don't play this game unless you have hundreds of hours you can kill with grinding and over £50.

8137	0	a	This game is a MMO game that you would expect to be colorful and fun, but it's the complete opposite of that.You play the game by going into little doors then you battle bosses and stuff like that. The chance of you dying is so high even people on drugs are jealous.And when you die you lose your level rank, i was rank ten and then i died so i had to go back to rank one!! There are people that will follow you around and when you kill something they will pick up whatever you find so the game is worthless. Don't Buy the game unless you wanna waste time and as always.Stay Foxy my friends!  -Foxy 
8138	0	a	IT JUST BLACKSCREENS WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥!
8139	0	a	why must every time you die you have to make a new character!!!!
8140	0	a	Way back in 2012, I loved this game. I loved it a metric ♥♥♥♥ton and I could not for the life of me get enough of it. I even wrote an older review and reccomended it to everyone I knew. For what it was, RotMG was a game that seemed just perfect for my tastes.   What happened? It went the way of all too many decent games and got sold out by its creators into a cesspool of Pay-To-Win ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. While spambots have been around since way before that, they've also been given a free hand to multiply like a strain of parasitic bacteria, and flood the chatbox of every major lobby on every server in the game. You can gag one to stop the floodproof garbage and two new bots with randomly generated names will sign up and start spamming incessantly in its place when you return 15 minutes later. From the beginning it's been pretty clear that Wildshadow has never given a single flying ♥♥♥♥ just how much of a ♥♥♥♥♥tain all of these spambots have been from the beginning and their continuously growing presence everywhere; for all I know and may well presume they could even be getting paid by the scamvertising sites that generate these bots to ignore them and all complaints that people make about them.  But the bots aren't even the main reason I called ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and quit this game for good more than a year and a half ago. As I mentioned before, the game became a literal Pay-To-Win overnight. For the low, low price of only 40 dollars you can buy all of what was formerly the rarest and highest tiered equipment in the entire game, hoard it, even throw it out the ♥♥♥♥ing window when the character you're using gets inevitably permakilled.  I don't know how much the game has actually changed since I cried over the schreeching, greed-induced musical trainwreck that convinced me to quit for good; I can safely vouch that the pay-to-win ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is still going as strong as ever, though, because holy ♥♥♥♥, money, holy ♥♥♥♥, buy all of your gameplay and success, holy ♥♥♥♥ people keep spending money on our ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ing system, keep it going! The one notable reward you got for dying all the time when I played was 'fame', which used to have at least some practical use as a type of currency for a point system, but it didn't take long before even that became utterly useless for anything because now you buy everything with 'gold', which, yes, can only be obtained by paying real live actual money. Before, gold was used for purely cosmetic and utilitarian purposes that didn't actually affect gameplay--buying extra character slots, color-changing dyes, extra storage space for items in the player's personal vault--and that was an acceptable, and purely optional, price to compensate for the fact that this game is free-to-play.   Now you walk into this game and find that the literal only way to enjoy it at all for what it was originally supposed to be (and what made it so addictive in the first place) is to naturally not take part in the Pay-To-Win system. But that's harder and harder to do because everyone else is wasting their parents' money on stupid ♥♥♥♥ in this game and ruining any challenge it has to offer by buying what could formerly only be obtained by grinding, exploring, and investing hours and hours of effort and countless more permadeaths to achieve a much longed-for personal goal. The mere fact that all the stupid kids keep feeding this ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ pay-to-win system is motivation enough for Wildshadow to sit its ♥♥♥ back and go the way of Valve. If you still want to play this game anyway, god forbid, don't feed the ♥♥♥♥ing beast. This disgusting system is spreading like a plague to online games everywhere because ♥♥♥♥tards keep on throwing money at it, and it's the literal equivalent of throwing heaps and heaps of cash down a bottomless sinkhole.

8145	0	a	Potentially nice game and it's for free, too. There's a 'but', of course.  I played it before on Kongregate and decided I would give it a shot here on Steam. But it's so buggy I'd say this isn't worth it not even for free.  Another example of a wasted gem due to lack of polishing.
8146	0	a	IT WONT ♥♥♥♥ING WORK
8147	0	a	Is this a minecarft ripoff or what
8148	0	a	So I decide to browse some free to play games, when I stumble upon this and remember: 'Hey, I used to love this game, why don't I re-install this and get back into it?'.  I wish I could.  So after it's done installing, I open it up. It says that there was an error, and that my account needed maintenance before I could play. I thought to myself: 'That's fine, I can wait a bit'. So it takes about 30 minutes, and I'm starting to get sick and tired of waiting. I open and close the game. Wait another 30 minutes. Doesn't work. Repeat. About 2 hours later (spending a grand total of 3 hours trying to get in) it finally managed to actually do something, and after 5 seconds, I was in the actual game. I thought: 'Great, finally, I can get in to play. I hope it's worth it.'  Nope! The servers were so bad that, after correctly entering my username and password again, it wouldn't let me get in. It was repeatedly trying to reconnect, and it never did. Now here I am, making this review. Just avoid this.

So at first i knew this was ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t but i stuck with it and added the guy, after getting to know him he was a great guy and he recomended this game to me so i started to play it and after that ive been hooked. Really great game if you can afford this free price tag then id recomend playing it.
8153	0	a	drops way to low for how bad it is when you die. its a waste of time and/or money trust me. you can grind all day being bored af and the only reason you are still playing is hoping you will get something good but never do... please just stay away from this game. its a trap.

I never figured out what the objective was, whether or not i could sell things, how to use potions, etc. And thats only the beginning.

If you like simple games that some person probably made in a day, this is for you, but I would not recommend this to friends. Overall, a 3/10 is what it gets from me.

8169	0	a	If you played before the game was bought out by Kabam, you can already see why I'm giving this a negative review. I've put close to 100 hours on the main website and back maybe 2-3 years ago this game was probably one of my favorites. However, after Kabam bought and gave up on maintaining this game, everything has gone to ♥♥♥♥. Servers are laggy as hell and can drop your connection at any given moment, bots are constantly spamming websites in chat, and all in-game purchases went from cosmetics to literally being able to buy the absolute end game tier loot which previously would take hours if not days to earn through trading.  Basically if you loved this before or are completely new to this game, it's a complete waste of your time.

8203	0	a	♥♥♥♥ REALM ♥♥♥♥ OFF GO AND ♥♥♥♥ YOUR SELF I DEIDED OF INVISIBLE THING IN PUPET AND I WAS 7/8  ALL ATHOR GAMES I MUSH BETTER THEN RELAM!! kABAM CAN FIX BUGS AND ADD NEW THINGS!! KABAM SUCKS MORE DEN THE NAZISTS
8204	0	a	[Generic Bad Review From Someone Who Idled 44.1 hrs on record To Make This Review]
8205	0	a	23 hours of the game and nothing fun about it.
8206	0	a	played the game a while back, thought it was boring, uninstalled (or maybe it was on the browser, i cant remember) came back, expecting to find some newfound interest in it, i made a new character and the game was nice enough to start me in a tutorial. I pressed 1 on my keypad and was sent straight to the main lobby. I never figured out what the objective was, whether or not i could sell things, how to use potions, etc. And thats only the beginning. If you want to read through some of the longer reviews go ahead, they explain the community and all the botters/cheaters better than I can. Thank god that you can turn off the chat window.
8207	0	a	Let me start by saying I loved playing the game.........when it worked and if I had paid for it I would have been extremely angry. It glitched continually and constantly after my first game.
8208	0	a	Overwhelmingly full of spam accounts. I went to nexus and was hit with a wall of text that I could do nothing about, This game is not what it was.
8209	0	a	Loot Stealing and they have it setup too easily to spend your GOLD(also purchaseds with Real World Money), by just pressing a button. -gold even though you didn't want to (No refund possible) This is all just about setting up your next character and nothing more. There is no real end game, because the end game is more stay alive the longest. Nothing you where can ever be seen again without randomly looting it; which someone else might steal from you anyways...  Can't recommend this at all = Money trap, unfair and no real replay value  Only things that could make me return: 1. loot timer to allow you and/or your party to loot 2. No Perma Death 3. No Exploits (reduction) 4. DEVS actually caring  Rating: 3/10 ...but could've easily been one of my favorite games, but then I played it...
8210	0	a	the game is crap once u die u cant play ever again
8211	0	a	this game sucks
8212	0	a	  Look this game is a buy to win game if you don't buy you will suck, not being able to get the higher teir weapons and armor. and if you rage then this game is for you......
8213	0	a	4/10 would not play again
8214	0	a	23 hours of the game and nothing fun about it.

8216	0	a	eh, not really
8217	0	a	most unresponsive ♥♥♥♥ing controls i have ever seen
8218	0	a	This game runs so ♥♥♥♥ing slow, I can bearly make it too level 3 I've only played the game for an hour, it just be me, but I just continously attack and run towards the enemy and I'm doing the complete opposite from I want to happen, it's like you need an alienware PC just to play it, my PC should play it fine, but no, it doesn't
8219	0	a	Runes of Magic is a piece of crap game, there by making this game a piece of crap as well by default.
8220	0	a	I poured about 100 or so Steam hours into this game, but maybe 300 hours if you count browser. This was an AWESOME game... until pets, now if you're reading this before you play the game, yes, the game has pets. They have their own abilities and such, but... they can get really powerful, like, godly powerful. There are pets out there that will heal about 1/5 of your health every SECOND. And there are people with money, or... time, to grind or buy things to level up their pet and increase their abilities. A majority of what's left of the community has played for over 1+ years so everybody pretty much has endgame items, and the people who are new can barely get anything unless you go on a small server, but even those are being overrun. There are more cons than pros, I just feel like everybody left. 0/10  
8221	0	a	This game sucks i played for about an hour and my guy moved around by himself and use his wepon whenever he wanted and this game has horibble gore.
8222	0	a	pay for everything with real money? suck a d bro.
8223	0	a	good concept bad company
8224	0	a	Waste of time, and boring.
8225	0	a	This game was fun for the first couple of minutes until you die, finding you have lost all of your hard earned ultra rare items and then goto a corner crying and raging at the game for the rule 'when you die, you stay dead'
8226	0	a	THIS GAME IS THE WORST GAME EVER! IT IS WORSE THAN LEAGUE OF LOWSKILL PLZ DELETE AND EAT PIZZA.
8227	0	a	This Is Very Boring!  I Don't Like Boring Stuff And JUNK Like This

8234	0	a	Bad game, if you can call it that. Free roam, quest-less, random boss fighting.
8235	0	a	TO MUCH  GRINDING  WOULD RATE 9/11
8236	0	a	It sucks worse than the SNES superman game. That means this is litteraly the worst game in existance. EVER.
8237	0	a	After hours of playing and grinding I logged on to find that all of my characters were deleted for no reason even after checking them earlier that day. Don't get me wrong it's a fun game but in order to be playable glitches like this need to be fixed. This is not the first time something like this has happened to me in this game.
8238	0	a	It would be a good game if you could loot dead players so players could either get their stuff back or their friends could grab their stuff and give it back to them. The fact that a simple, and quite frequent, lag spikes WILL kill you, makes the die-and-lose-everything mechanic turn this game into a very unappealing time killer. I hope the creators at least fix the high amount of lag. However, the game itself is okay.
8239	0	a	Didn't really like it, the death was too much. Losing all your items and progress is just not fun, especially with latency.
8240	0	a	I hate this game so much it is trashy so boring and pixelated and it gets so ♥♥♥♥ing boring after a while and i hate it, porbably the worst game on steam and it is just really bad. All i got to say is it is not worth the price of free or the space of 38 MB.
8241	0	a	♥♥♥♥ this
8242	0	a	5.5/10
8243	0	a	Dis game is very good. On the levels of good videojuegos such as MienCreft and exsellent titles of the liks of FarKry, and Skirim with Guns. I lov the griping gamepley. Mjuch worser than MeinCraft. Though;
8244	0	a	Just bought some stuffs then got stucked at a screen saying 'load error, retrying'
8245	0	a	Broken game, played with my friend. A icon got bugged on my screen, afterwards restarted the game to fix this bug I can no longer play. It is stuck in this 'Loading...' screen. Upon this I searched on Google, couldn't find much except that I may have been banned for some apparent reason but I don't know.  Game works for some, but not for all. Becareful if you see this bug because afterwards your game will never start up again.
8246	0	a	This is by far the worst mmo rpg i have ever played. i actually think i would prefer adventure quest to this game. do not play ever. first of all the same music plays on loop through all the dungeons and in the nexus. second if you are new and ask for help all you will find are a bunch of bots spaming free coin websites and maybe one or two players that will call you a noob. thirdly there are no level 1 dungeons the lowest level dungeon is level 7-20 or something and that wouldn't be so much of a problem except that if you die you loose your character. so rating crappy game/10 .
8247	0	a	This game is very dumb! I bought a 20$ package to get me started and I die! I didnt know I lose all my stuff!
8248	0	a	Kabam ruined it...
8249	0	a	Get's old REALLY fast.
8250	0	a	I used to play this game on kongregate,was very fun,But now they turned it into a P2W and i dont want to spend my money on it.RIP game      ill rate 3/10
8251	0	a	When i get to the starting menu then click a class i dont have the option To play
8252	0	a	For me, Realm of the Mad God is a very boring game with lots of repetition and a low level of replay value. This is because the gameplay is very similar all the way through a 'life cycle' of each of your characters as there is too much emphasis on PvE and not enough on other elements such as a currency system, PVP and quests which would have made the game more enjoyable.  In addition, the game does not provide a good 'welcome' to new players as the first place you enter is the lobby, which is an overcrowded, laggy area.  Overall, this game is bad, but not outrageously terrible, so I am giving it an official grade of E.
8253	0	a	fun if your into perma-death games where your only way to advance is to grind out levels like a mad god (lol) or spend real money on expensive gear... it's more like a free phone app then a pc game...
8254	0	a	You get addicted then lose all your items and get ♥♥♥♥♥♥..
8255	0	a	I don't recommend this game for multiple reasons , and yes I couldn't stand it more than 20 minutes !  1- The game itself is boring , maybe it's not my cup of tea .  2-Where ever you go you have to pay real money , and a stupid window keeps poping up to ask you to buy which is really annoying .  3-The chat is full of spammers and bots who keeps spamming the screen of the same damn thing about you getting free items blah blah blah , It could be prevented easily but seems the devs don't care to do so .  
8256	0	a	If you have alot of money and time, yes, If you are a F2p gamer that doesn't want to pay money for games, then no.  I love this game alot, but i have to say its really p2w. You have to have a fat wallet because either you have to go hours hunting for bosses just to get tier 8, or buy thousands of coins to buy a 2cd character with armor and a good sword and pet. When they update the game to not P2W I will recommend, but for now i will only recommend if you have months of free time or a fat wallet.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Graphics: 8/10  Sounds: 10/10  Gameplay(buying stuff): 8/10  Gameplay(Finding stuff): 4.5/10  Bosses/enemies: 8/10   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Overall: 6.1/10
8257	0	a	The game is almost dead, with plenty of griefers and cheaters. People getting banned left and right. The game hasn't received a good update in years and it is 'Pay 2 Win' with overpriced virtual items. Permadeath wouldn't be as bad if griefers don't get you killed. In this state, it's a fun game for the first couple of hours, then you see how much of a grindfest it is.  3/10
8258	0	a	Very ♥♥♥♥ game
8259	0	a	i died and i got SUPER mad because when you die, you loose all your stuff. I had super good stuff and so I slammed my computer with my elbow and now it is broken :(
8260	0	a	this game sux

8269	0	a	Okay, I'm likely to get some hate for this post, but since I feel like being in the minority, Ima do it anyway.  Let's get one thing straight; Realm of the Mad God (ROTMG) is a good, fun game. Yes, you read that correctly. It has it's flaws, but overall, I'd say it's a good, fun game. Why is this review negative? We'll get to that in a minute. In the meantime; THE POSITIVES!  If you've never played, ROTMG is a 2D top-down shooter type game, that plays somewhat rougelike, with the exception of vaults that you can keep, although it has minimal storage unless you buy more with real $$$. It has lots of dungeons to explore, metric TONS of enemies to slash through, and many different classes to play, each with their own playstyle and abilities.   The main 'goal' of the game is to kill 'The Mad God; Oryx.' However, with practice and teamwork, this is easily achieved. What most players consider to be a worthy challange is 'Maxing' all eight (8) stats on their character (Becoming an 8/8, or 'Fully Maxed' player) Using stat upgrade potions, dropped from various enemies and bosses.   It IS fun, it has quite a bit of content, especially for a newcommer, and in fact, with how often you die*, you could say it has great replay value too, needing to put in more hours, create more characters, try different playstyles, die more after you find a playstyle that doesn't work too well*, '8/8' the characters the survive long enough for you to do so, ect.  However, those asterisks that you may've seen: Death. Death is more common than air in ROTMG. You go into almost any realm, I can GURANTEE that someone has died in it. This may not seem that big a deal, about two (2) people die IRL every second, (True Fact) so why is a big deal here? The problem comes when you realize that you can sometimes spend LITERAL YEARS on some of these characters, (Which, I have done, Though not documented due to playing via website and not Steam) and even spend real $$$ too. Then, it's not okay.  Also, you may notice, I keep bringing up the subject of..... the dreaded.... MICROTRANSACTIONS! D; Yes, they're here, and they are PLENTIFUL. It's called 'gold', and it's used for EVERYTHING. Want to change your character's name? Gold. Wanna buy some equips without trading? Gold. Wanna upgrade your pet without wasting away in the eternal pit of hell named 'EUNorth2'? GOLD. Wanna have more than one character at a time, or more vault space for those characters?  GOLD!  Frankly, I find it worse than playing a mobile game with how much this 'Free' game tries to rob you blind whilst playing it.  Another tick aganst this game is the characters; Something which SHOULD be a positive addition to this game. The problem? They're unbalanced as all heck. Some characters like, 'Priest,' 'Necromancer,' and 'Mystic' are almost un-playable, with how much they struggle to obtain even the most common of loot. They are easily out-damaged, hard to/impossible get any equips that make them worth playing, and just generally ignoreable.  On the other side of the spectrum: 'Wizard' and 'Warrior.' Where to even begin with this duo...? Let's start with the main reason for playing these two classes: The stats. Both have the highest ATK (Attack) Stat possible in the game without equips, and Wizard in particular, can achieve the highest total ATK, and highest DPS (Damage Per Second) in the game. Warrior, also pumps out an impressive amount of DPS, and can also be configured to have the highest total DEF (Defense) Stat in the game, short of being invincible. This makes them extremely Overpowered, and makes playing any other class not recommended at best, and downright pointless at worst.  There's one more point I'd like to make before ending this review; Pros. Here's the thing: Pros are inevitable. If you have a game, people will get good at it. Those good people will continue to be good, and will be better than other players. Problem is, in a pay-to-win game that's otherwise  LUCK BASED , Having so many 'Pros' that can easily out-damage you on bosses, Get to &amp; Kill events faster than you, and generally be more effecient than you at the game, can be VERY frustrating.  This, is the biggest point to me, because of a fact; No matter how much you play this game, or even how much money you decide to spend, SOMEONE WILL BE BETTER THAN YOU. This kills the ENTIRE point of a video game to me; Something to pour your extra hours into, untill you become the best you can be, and feel the sense of accomplishment, and feel like you did something worthwhile.  In sum, This game is fun, but only if you can settle for having some features of the game locked away behind solid-gold prison bars, and accepting the fact that you will never be the best player.
8270	0	a	Fun game, my MMO of choice, however, the game is no longer noob friendly to get into, mainly due to pets.  Pets is this game are overpowered, and a bad mechanic in general.  Leveling your pet is permanant, and there's no drawback for using one, your pet can't 'die' and can be shared across all characters. The main abilities that people have on their pets (and the only ones worth even using) are heal and magic (mana) heal.  Pets heal you and your mana to the point where you'll almost never need to use potions, the heal is so significant that you can run recklessly through dungeons without consequence, and that your vitality and wisdom stats are basically non-existent. (A maxed legendary pet will heal you for 90HP a SECOND, health potions heal you for 100HP, and you'll usually only be carrying 6 at a time.)  However, leveling a pet like this is slow and clunky, new player will find themself spending a rediculous amount of time to level their pet. Let alone getting an appropriately abilitied pet in the first place.  But, this can be sped up with a price.  Thats right, you can pay money SIGNIFICANTLY speed up the progression of your pet. Meaning you can spend money basically to GAIN REDICULOUS PERMANANT BUFFS FOR EVERY CHARACTER YOUR CREATE. Of course, you can also accomplish this playing for free, but getting a legend pet like that means you probably have put over 1000 hours into the game by now.  However, this is mainly due to Kabam's fault, we have new owners of the game, DECA to hopefully fix some of the damages Kabam has done to this game. Sorry to leave a thumbs down for you DECA, but I can't recommend this game to someone new in the current state its in. &lt;3
8271	0	a	Walked into a forest, get lost and suddenly hundreds of thousands of everything are gang ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me. Tried to run back where I came from, got more lost, couldn't escape the ♥♥♥♥nado died 0/10 where the ♥♥♥♥ did all those guys come from
8272	0	a	It was a beautiful game at some point, where everyone happily played together and stole each others weapons when they died. And then Kabam came along and ♥♥♥♥ed it all up. I used to love this game, now it's ♥♥♥♥. I still play it ocassionally but it's not that fun considering that I lost my main account (I don't really care, suicided all my characters anyways) and my new account sucks ♥♥♥♥. So yea, you can try it out, it's still a good game, but not as good as it once was.
8273	0	a	Multiple second input lag, playing in the tutorial, on a pixel game. What the ♥♥♥♥. I know my computer's not that great, but if it can run WoW, it should be able to run this well...
8274	0	a	This game is only good for those who have fast computers. Otherwise it is quite laggy &amp; I would not recomend it...
8275	0	a	OMG I FREAKEN BOUGHT 2 CHARCTER SLOT BUNDLE THEN GOT BANNED BECAUSE OF SYSTEM ERROR THEY GAVE ME 3 CHARACTER SLOTS ♥♥♥♥ THIS ♥♥♥♥♥♥YY GAME 
8276	0	a	It's a nice game but pay to win level is so high i have to give it a negative and for pointless grinding cuz you are gonna die son
8277	0	a	Mmmm no sorry, not quite my thing.
8278	0	a	uhhh why?
8279	0	a	you lose all your stuff when you die in a stupit way
8280	0	a	So I found this game and thought, hey I should give it a try, it looks pretty cool! I enter the game, welcomed by some really cool music, and so far everything was good, that was until I started playing. At first, through the tutorial I was fine, but after when I actually tried to fight the scorp queen and other mobs, I was just lagging horribly. I switched servers multiple times, I even picked 2 servers close to where I live, yet still that lag was still there. I even checked my own ping to see if it was just me, but my ping was around 20. Seriously, this game looks really good, and it is for the 2 or 3 seconds it's not lagging, but other wise, you literally can't get passed level 5 when you're moving in commands you did 5 seconds ago.
8281	0	a	the menus didnt work so then i had to restart the game. 
8282	0	a	This would be a fantastic game! But ever since I got one death, I get stuck at the character selection screen and the game won't let me play.
8283	0	a	pretty hard, fun for a limited time. I would recommend to spend your time on better games. 4/10
8284	0	a	too passive by yourself
8285	0	a	I do like this game a lot, but that was mostly back then... I will continue to play it but I am sad at the fact kabam converted this from an amazing and somewhat balanced game to something more pay to win, just about two or three years ago you could fight pretty tough monsters (medium or upper medium) after only playing about 20 minutes, I felt it was easy but when you hit that point it became challenging to progress, now it seems to be much harder to progress without paying money, the games secondary currency, Fame, had uses, now it is useless other than using it on your pets, so we are now forced to use the Realm Gold (Premium Currency). Ive been playing this for a while without putting in a dime and I have made little progress, while the pros (People that have money to spend on gear and everything else) can handle much stronger enemies like Oryx and his direct minions, or whatever else. Some people are just simply really good at the game and have invested far more time than me, but after over 40 hours and there being just about no progression I can say the Developers need to come back to this game they left and ignored.
8286	0	a	Was good, now a new company ruined it. =( 100% pay to win.
8287	0	a	A well put together game it needs a more interesting story.
8288	0	a	I used to play this game on kongregate,was very fun,But now they turned it into a P2W and i dont want to spend my money on it.RIP game      ill rate 3/10
8289	0	a	I don't recommend this game for multiple reasons , and yes I couldn't stand it more than 20 minutes !  1- The game itself is boring , maybe it's not my cup of tea .  2-Where ever you go you have to pay real money , and a stupid window keeps poping up to ask you to buy which is really annoying .  3-The chat is full of spammers and bots who keeps spamming the screen of the same damn thing about you getting free items blah blah blah , It could be prevented easily but seems the devs don't care to do so .  
8290	0	a	a truly maddening game thats slightly addictive, has went massively downhill since being bought out however and all the time invested can be made worthless with even the slightest delay or interuption in the connection
8291	0	a	If you like MMOs well then,this is your game! Although i don't. Addin that to the fact that the game uses real money is just...unappealing. I know it keeps the game running,But not like this.I didn't like this game much...
8292	0	a	Looks a little like Ragnarök Online.. but is much more boring.
8293	0	a	Wont even load.
8294	0	a	this game sucks ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥   NEVER PLAY IT 
8295	0	a	Realm of the Mad God is admitally a fun game... if it actually worked. For me almost everytime I click play or some other button the game freezes. Another problem is when I try to connect it doesn't work even though my Internet works. Also, the F2P model where you pay Billions of dollars for ingame items is here. I uninstalled after I got it and tried to play for an hour. If you want this game don't get the Steam Version play the browser version.
8296	0	a	well ii havnt even played it but ofcource i hav a mac so this might be different about yall but basicly my computer will freeze when it gets the loading screen;(
8297	0	a	No,just no. And I know what your thinking,how can you say this game is bad if you only play 11 minutes of it? Well,I played a bunch of this game online and saw it on Steam. I thought it might have been better than the version online... I WAS WRONG! This is the same thing as the online version but much worser. Whenever you fire your weapon,it gets stuck just firing and firing and firing. Basicly what you do in this game is shoot,level up,get item,shoot,level up,get item. Thats it. I'm not joking,thats all there is to this game. Screw this game. Period
8298	0	a	I played this game just a little over a year ago and are dissapointed after coming back that now WildShadow, a company that I had a lot of respect and appreciation from me, have sold out to a bigger company called Kabam. you may think 'whats the big problem gosh.' Before WildShadow sold out the game was fun, leveling was fun, trading was fun, heck even grinding was enjoyable. Now grinding takes at least a day, the way they managed to make a free to play game into what people call a 'freemium game' dissapoints me and is just downright stupid. WildShadow had made sure that the only things you could get with real money were vanity items like pets or cool looking dyes. Kabam ruined this and now a new player after downloading this game can instantly throw money at their computer and have the best items in the game just because their wallet was fatter. The permadeath feature people complain about is actually one of the most exillerating parts of this game, getting surrounded by baddies then spamming your nexus key so hard it breaks your keyboard and surviving is just so relieving. Even that was ruined buy (hehe see what I did there) the way that if you die you can just get your gear back practically instantly, once again, because you have more money to throw at your computer. I used to enjoy this game so much and was happy to see that it was on the rise, sadly greed gets the better of us someday.
8299	0	a	this game is....meh.  the gameplay is meh.  the fighting is plain bad.  the graphics is meh.  like i said this game is just meh.

8309	0	a	With so many moving parts to learn and a seemingly infinite breadth of options to explore, diving into any new MMO is a major investment of time and energy. It's exhausting, really, which is why I appreciate a game like the free-to-play Realm of the Mad God. This fantasy-themed, co-operative bullet hell MMORPG is beautifully simple, yet deep enough to keep you chained to your PC for days on end. It takes only a minute or so to get right into the action, and, once you get a taste for running around with a gaggle of your fellow pixelated-warriors raising hell and slaying beasts across the online realm, it's hard to stop.  Like any of the other thousands of players populating the bustling game world, you've been summoned by Oryx the Mad God to serve as dinner for his hungry minions. Of course, you've got other plans. Venturing out beyond the safety of the hub nexus, your mission is to blast beasties, collect loot, grow more powerful, and then stick it to the evil deity. Spraying magic projectiles around the screen while dodging incoming fire from blocky sumo wrestlers, dragons, goblin wizards, and stranger creatures you encounter takes on a classic, arcade-like quality. The straightforwardness is appealing – move, shoot, collect – and when you weave in exploration, obsessive loot hunting, RPG character growth and the camaraderie of smiting evil alongside other adventurers, sessions grow intensely hypnotic. Even if you never survive long enough get reach Oryx's doom lair, there's a ton of fun to be found in collaborating with other players in battle and unlocking cool new classes to play.  Each of Realm of the Mad God's 13 unique character classes are accessed by reaching certain level benchmarks in other classes. Above all, this is what kept me glued to my keyboard playing for hours at a time. You start as a mewling wizard who can fire blasts of magic in any direction, but as you play longer and level-up, you eventually open-up more interesting classes like the necromancer, huntress, mystic, and assassin. Every class has its own set of weapons and items, magic powers, special abilities, and perks. They all play differently, and I got a thrill every time I unlocked a new one to try out. This adds tremendous replay potential too, since unlocking the coolest characters requires you to spend some serious time with each class.  Perma-death layers-on an intense roguelike element to the already zany large-scale bullet hell RPG slugfest unfolding on any given server, and it seriously ups the challenge and risk factor. Getting careless will get you killed and force you to re-start your current character over from level 1. As frustrating as it can be, death is sometimes a welcome opportunity to try out another class, since you can only have one character at a time without using microtransactions to purchase additional slots. But when you're committed to keeping your favorite character alive, the threat of losing all your hard-earned experience and loot gently nudges you into working together with other players and forming impromptu gang of warriors to tackle the tougher swarms of foes as a group.  Realm of the Mad God's streamlined approach to MMO gaming also changes up player interaction in good ways. Since there's no PvP, everyone in the realm is after the same goals – slay, loot, and level-up. As you come across other players, the desire to tag along and pitch in for tougher fights comes intuitively. You share the experienced gained from defeating foes as long as you hit them once, and there's generally plenty of loot to go around. Typing in chat text makes a speech bubble appear over your hero, and communicating in short bursts is effective for concocting plans outside of the heat of battle. When you do find other comrades you want to stick with, you can highlight nearby players and lock their names to your menu bar, allowing you to teleport to their location instantly if you get separated. It's a simple and easy-to-use system that works well.  The realm itself is surprisingly vast, with a diverse landscape that holds more dangerous and inventive foes the further you venture away from your spawn point. Weaker baddies, like scorpions and pirates, populate the sunny beachside. But push through the thick forests, crumbling ruins, and mountains beyond, and you'll find powerful god-like foes capable of slaying low-level adventurers with a single strike. It's these formidable opponents you have to defeat in order to reach Oryx. Thankfully, when you need a break from battle or a quick getaway, tapping the insert key warps you back to the safety of the nexus where you can trade, use fame points or in-game cash to purchase special items, form a guild, and heal-up.  When so much of the MMO experience is pared down for ease of access and quick play, it's a shame that the controls aren't as tight as they should be for the arcade-style shooter gameplay. Movement with the WASD keys sometimes gets gummed up if you're clicking around to shoot a lot while changing direction. Holding the firing button down or toggling auto-fire smoothes this out a bit, but it's frustrating to die because you get stuck walking in the wrong direction for a few seconds longer than you meant to and wind up charging into the middle of a rampaging horde of angry elves. Fortunately, it's not a game-breaker. While the control wonkiness is a pain, the absorbing gameplay drowns out the irritation it causes.  It may be vastly different from its big-league brethren, but this stylish indie MMO has loads of staying power to match its unique concept. Realm of the Mad God’s accessible arcade-style bullet hell action blends with RPG nerdiness in some truly potent ways, and the lovely pixilated world holds an abundance of adventure that’s ripe for the taking. Easy to jump into and damn near impossible to quit, this unusual free-to-play MMO hybrid is worth every second of your spare time.

Finally, other players are mostly just in the way on this game. They don't add anything positive to the experience at all.
8324	0	a	while it seems like i havent played this game a lot i did on kongrekate   The game itself isnt bad, its very and fun  But the pay to play aspect ruined the game  Usually im pretty cool with buy in's with game but this is just annoying   I would and i wouldnt reccomend this game.  Its fun and all all but the pay to play ruins it  so for the sake of this review im going to put a no   7.5/10

8334	0	a	Bullet hell and roguelike RPGs is one of the worst ideas ever.  &gt;Permadeath, swarms of inconquerable, overpowered enemies that can kill you in 2 hits. &gt;Lose all hard earned items that you spend hours looking for. &gt;Pay to win, everything essential for you to be a 'pro' at this game requires real money. &gt;Horrible hit detection, insanely laggy servers, jittery enemies. &gt;All of the decent equipment is insanely rare unless you buy it with real money. &gt;All but 4 of the 13 playable classes are completely useless pieces of crap.  TL:DR This game sucks, don't play it and save yourself the time.

This game aint for me if the programers cant even think or address duals screen issues.  Voted no as stated above.
8346	0	a	its trash
8347	0	a	Okay, I'm likely to get some hate for this post, but since I feel like being in the minority, Ima do it anyway.  Let's get one thing straight; Realm of the Mad God (ROTMG) is a good, fun game. Yes, you read that correctly. It has it's flaws, but overall, I'd say it's a good, fun game. Why is this review negative? We'll get to that in a minute. In the meantime; THE POSITIVES!  If you've never played, ROTMG is a 2D top-down shooter type game, that plays somewhat rougelike, with the exception of vaults that you can keep, although it has minimal storage unless you buy more with real $$$. It has lots of dungeons to explore, metric TONS of enemies to slash through, and many different classes to play, each with their own playstyle and abilities.   The main 'goal' of the game is to kill 'The Mad God; Oryx.' However, with practice and teamwork, this is easily achieved. What most players consider to be a worthy challange is 'Maxing' all eight (8) stats on their character (Becoming an 8/8, or 'Fully Maxed' player) Using stat upgrade potions, dropped from various enemies and bosses.   It IS fun, it has quite a bit of content, especially for a newcommer, and in fact, with how often you die*, you could say it has great replay value too, needing to put in more hours, create more characters, try different playstyles, die more after you find a playstyle that doesn't work too well*, '8/8' the characters the survive long enough for you to do so, ect.  However, those asterisks that you may've seen: Death. Death is more common than air in ROTMG. You go into almost any realm, I can GURANTEE that someone has died in it. This may not seem that big a deal, about two (2) people die IRL every second, (True Fact) so why is a big deal here? The problem comes when you realize that you can sometimes spend LITERAL YEARS on some of these characters, (Which, I have done, Though not documented due to playing via website and not Steam) and even spend real $$$ too. Then, it's not okay.  Also, you may notice, I keep bringing up the subject of..... the dreaded.... MICROTRANSACTIONS! D; Yes, they're here, and they are PLENTIFUL. It's called 'gold', and it's used for EVERYTHING. Want to change your character's name? Gold. Wanna buy some equips without trading? Gold. Wanna upgrade your pet without wasting away in the eternal pit of hell named 'EUNorth2'? GOLD. Wanna have more than one character at a time, or more vault space for those characters?  GOLD!  Frankly, I find it worse than playing a mobile game with how much this 'Free' game tries to rob you blind whilst playing it.  Another tick aganst this game is the characters; Something which SHOULD be a positive addition to this game. The problem? They're unbalanced as all heck. Some characters like, 'Priest,' 'Necromancer,' and 'Mystic' are almost un-playable, with how much they struggle to obtain even the most common of loot. They are easily out-damaged, hard to/impossible get any equips that make them worth playing, and just generally ignoreable.  On the other side of the spectrum: 'Wizard' and 'Warrior.' Where to even begin with this duo...? Let's start with the main reason for playing these two classes: The stats. Both have the highest ATK (Attack) Stat possible in the game without equips, and Wizard in particular, can achieve the highest total ATK, and highest DPS (Damage Per Second) in the game. Warrior, also pumps out an impressive amount of DPS, and can also be configured to have the highest total DEF (Defense) Stat in the game, short of being invincible. This makes them extremely Overpowered, and makes playing any other class not recommended at best, and downright pointless at worst.  There's one more point I'd like to make before ending this review; Pros. Here's the thing: Pros are inevitable. If you have a game, people will get good at it. Those good people will continue to be good, and will be better than other players. Problem is, in a pay-to-win game that's otherwise  LUCK BASED , Having so many 'Pros' that can easily out-damage you on bosses, Get to &amp; Kill events faster than you, and generally be more effecient than you at the game, can be VERY frustrating.  This, is the biggest point to me, because of a fact; No matter how much you play this game, or even how much money you decide to spend, SOMEONE WILL BE BETTER THAN YOU. This kills the ENTIRE point of a video game to me; Something to pour your extra hours into, untill you become the best you can be, and feel the sense of accomplishment, and feel like you did something worthwhile.  In sum, This game is fun, but only if you can settle for having some features of the game locked away behind solid-gold prison bars, and accepting the fact that you will never be the best player.
8348	0	a	Fun game, my MMO of choice, however, the game is no longer noob friendly to get into, mainly due to pets.  Pets is this game are overpowered, and a bad mechanic in general.  Leveling your pet is permanant, and there's no drawback for using one, your pet can't 'die' and can be shared across all characters. The main abilities that people have on their pets (and the only ones worth even using) are heal and magic (mana) heal.  Pets heal you and your mana to the point where you'll almost never need to use potions, the heal is so significant that you can run recklessly through dungeons without consequence, and that your vitality and wisdom stats are basically non-existent. (A maxed legendary pet will heal you for 90HP a SECOND, health potions heal you for 100HP, and you'll usually only be carrying 6 at a time.)  However, leveling a pet like this is slow and clunky, new player will find themself spending a rediculous amount of time to level their pet. Let alone getting an appropriately abilitied pet in the first place.  But, this can be sped up with a price.  Thats right, you can pay money SIGNIFICANTLY speed up the progression of your pet. Meaning you can spend money basically to GAIN REDICULOUS PERMANANT BUFFS FOR EVERY CHARACTER YOUR CREATE. Of course, you can also accomplish this playing for free, but getting a legend pet like that means you probably have put over 1000 hours into the game by now.  However, this is mainly due to Kabam's fault, we have new owners of the game, DECA to hopefully fix some of the damages Kabam has done to this game. Sorry to leave a thumbs down for you DECA, but I can't recommend this game to someone new in the current state its in. &lt;3
8349	0	a	i played this with a loser for a while
8350	0	a	A truly and completely disgusting game, once a small, fair indie gem, marred ceaselessly by playability issues, soul-crushing lag, and microtransactions.   I deeply regret ever installing RotMG, and yet, past each cessation, I return. It's not that I find its simple graphics charming, or its dry characters appealing, or that I take any joy from any aspect of RotMG's design. I simply must conquer this roguelike. Is the game not unmasterable?  I see others, ones with maxed stats, and gear from the highest tier, who strafe and weave through their foes, cutting down the Gods like a nuclear flaming laser sword cuts down a half-stick of butter - But every time you may find yourself on the cusp of greatness, the edge of glory, the precipace of acclaim or the fringe of victory, you will die instantaneously from lag. A lowly and meagre enemy from an area not even loaded will strike you down, and the server might not even deem it fit to inform you of this most inauspicious and inescapable anticlimax, the final loss of an unparalleled character you will, without a doubt, never really forget.  Take my advice - Don't even think about playing this game.
8351	0	a	this games community is literally aids, the worst, even worse then non-prime cs mm. but its alright i guess
8352	0	a	Played for a bit. Seemed fun. Interface is confusing. I found the options once. I couldn't find them again.  Stopped to read an item and was killed by a 'Grey blob' a creature in the game that moves too fast for you to react and will likely kill you instantly... in a game with permadeath... in the beginning area. Stupid enough to make me drop the game. Probably exists to promote the pay to win element of the game since it is very difficult to progress normally.

8357	0	a	Possibly my most played game ever, but unfortunantly, it has been taken over by kabam, adding TONS more micro-transactions. Still a very enjoyable game, and you can ignore all the transactions to play legit. Nothing has a pay wall, but every item can be bought for $.  P.s. Ignore my steam time, i would of played over 1000 hours on the browser version before i even HEARD of steam.

8370	0	a	this game is glitchy/buggy and it needs to be fixed
8371	0	a	I was not around for the change of developers, but I have never appreciated Pay to win games like these. Another thing about this game is the permadeath, I have no problem with permadeath, but this game takes too much work to just lose your items, There are hackers running rampant, phasing through walls, some can even take the items you offered in a trade without holding up their end. Now for the Pay to win part, keep that stuff in mobile games, as the amount of money you pay goes up, the number of gold coins you get per dollar goes up, as it should, but thats if you pay 100 US dollars, if you buy the smallest pack, which is 500 coins for 5 dollars, not only is it 100 coins to the dollar, The only items in the nexus that can be purchased with that amount can be traded for easily or even rarely found in the game as drops, I do not like this game one bit.   But I can not simply list out the bad things, this game is extremely addictive and fun for the most part, but very grueling and unforgiving, but somehow I relish every moment I get a good item or level up, play it if you want, but beware, Realm of the Mad God is JUST as rage inducing as LOL if not more.

8373	0	a	Worst game ever. So i get up to level 20 and 150 fame and all the best items, the a freaken enemy kills me, in ONE hit. I had really great defense and damage and I had to lose EVERYTHING, 5 hours of effort because an enemy kills me in ONE hit. Waste of time and effort. Horrid game.
8374	0	a	This game was way better off as a web browser game and not corrupted into the piece of ♥♥♥♥♥ it is today.  Not to mention it feels like its gained way more bugs than it ever had before. Pay 2 Win.  I miss you Kongregate..

8389	0	a	Considering the beta for this game was developed in a day there isn't much to say about it. The developers don't really care about the community and just care about the money. Updates are rare and when they do come out its ussually just a bug fix or a new weapon/skin. I apluad the game for it being free but other then that it is just a waste of time.

8405	0	a	Let me review this game with full detail. I've played this game for a long time, and I figured I might as well write a review on it on whether or not to absorb yourself into this game. First, let me explain how this game is played. When you first get the game and create an account, you are given 49 gold and 1 character slot. When I first saw this, I thought I could play the game to more extent and eventually earn enough gold to buy another slot. When I joined the lobby, I was swarmed by the noise of hundreds of players running around shooting randomly. All around the lobby were shops with items that cost gold. I noticed another currency called fame (earned after you die), but saw no items that cost fame. It turned out that not much could be purchased through fame, and the best items, while obtainable, couldn't be obtained without either spending hours and hours repeating the same process of fighting and dying until eventually you gain enough stat potions (which increase statistics such as attack and health) to attack bosses and inflict enough damage to recieve items from them. The stat potions themselves are ridiculously hard to find. Anyways, the only way to obtain items such as character slots and dungeon keys is gold. Also, this might be a game changer: when you die, you lose everything that your character had on you. In fact, fame is based on what you do in your life, and you don't recieve fame until after you've died. Now, to the multiplayer aspect. Co-operative gameply is astonishingly well, as you can recieve 'soulbound' loot from enemies that only you can pick up. This means people aren't rushing into a flame of projectiles to steal the items you got from killing something. Trading with others is another added bonus, but you won't have much luck with it unless you've spent hours collecting stat potions to trade with people who pay for the game. Sadly, there isn't much spam protection, and basically every time you join the lobby you are attacked by a wave in chat of online third party stores that sell potions and special items. So, in conclusion, it will either cost you either large amounts of your time or your money to get anything out of this game. So, if you are willing to spend either of those, then I reccomend this game, as it can be a lot of fun if you can get to this level. But be warned, you will get upset, you will quit this game for periods of time, and if you're like me, you wouldn't reccomend this game to other people. 
8406	0	a	the music is super annoying  game doesn't even try to hide the fact that it's pay-to-win  worst 10 minutes of my entire life
8407	0	a	it is an okay game but the problem is every thing you must pay for unless you wanna take a week to get goood things
8408	0	a	  NO, its pay to win and devastating look at. it is not puma reccomended..
8409	0	a	It was a beautiful game at some point, where everyone happily played together and stole each others weapons when they died. And then Kabam came along and ♥♥♥♥ed it all up. I used to love this game, now it's ♥♥♥♥. I still play it ocassionally but it's not that fun considering that I lost my main account (I don't really care, suicided all my characters anyways) and my new account sucks ♥♥♥♥. So yea, you can try it out, it's still a good game, but not as good as it once was.

8437	0	a	This game never worked , always gives an error of version or something..  Not Recommended
8438	0	a	This game is on a difficulty level even greater than games like Dark souls. This game, at its core, is frusterating. It uses a perma-death system, where when your character dies, he is gone for good. Any items, levels, or stats (Ill get into this later), are lost. There is a plethora of loot and items you can aquire, and its fun to go into dungeons to get special drops. Special mobs and bosses drop pots, when increase one stat by 1. You are able to 'max' your character by filling out the 8 stats. There are also a lot of different classes, with different weapons, armor, special abilities, and stat gain. You, however, cannot max your character without these pots, so it becomes a risk if your not careful in areas. A huge con is how the drop system works. Getting unbound items, or UTs, requires you to do a specail amount of damage to the target. This proves difficult in the early stages of your character, as getting the amount of damage is very hard without high stats and good items. Many classes have a better advantage when it comes to dealing damage, which gives a big disconnect to when you try and do a dungeon as a class who cannot give as much dps as another. This game is extremly Pay2Win, as the developers allow you to buy your weapons and armor right out of the gate. This also allows you to get higher stats, as you can trade these armors with other players for pots. Overall, this game is hard, and has so much risk for little reward. Only play if your capable to handle loss.
8439	0	a	At first its fun after few minutes of playing the game you will know its horibble. You like the game? Get a LIFE then.
8440	0	a	This game is very boring,easy,repetitive and you can't do anything new it's all the same  Realm of the Mad God pfffft more like Realm of Regret
8441	0	a	One of the worst games I played in my enitre life it has pay 2 win all over it. You buy good items with real money and lose them on your death. My friend gave me paid items but it was lost on my death. Don't play this game it's a leech to your walllet
8442	0	a	I do not recomed beacause you will run around in cirles with out press the up and down keys lvl 1'sndie in 30 secs beacause of that. Also the frist classes you git SUCK the warorrior and wizard are the best.And their is lag when their 100 guyes coming ever where when ur a lvl1.Also the AI of the monsters sucks they'll case you around the world untill u kill them. thats why i do not recmond this game
8443	0	a	I have over one thousand hours on this game (I switched to flash player later) so you must be wondering why the hell is he voting not reccomend well, because it is TOO addicting all I thing about is RotMG so anyways 9.8/10 nothing wrong with this game besides bs deaths and addictivness.
8444	0	a	Update: This is not a review, but a recommendation. I don't think the game is bad, but if someone asked me if they should play it, I'd say no. The game features pets that follow you around and make you extremely overpowered (something which wasn't always in the game), but only if your pet has a very high level. You can either feed your pet to level it, something which takes a really long time (I'm talking about years), or just spend a bunch of money and have it instantly overpowered. I feel that the game is very unfair to those new to the game and who do not have pets or have them at a very low level.

8454	0	a	This is a first person shooter in which the god, oryx has stolen your giraffe, you and i dont know how many other people still play this pile of ♥♥♥♥ (it used to actually be a great game) go on a journey to ♥♥♥♥ off the god so much, that he will whip out his ♥♥♥♥ and release all his fury upon you, forcing you to find shelter and camp by sniping out of it untill the gods dead. How will you ♥♥♥♥ off this big ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you may ask? Well its simple. You kill his sex slaves, and eat his grandma. After this you'll be teleported to his sex dungeon in which you kill a hell of alot of enemies and then get to the god and you have to fight him, to kill him you cut off his ♥♥♥♥♥ and then shove your ♥♥♥♥ in his nostrils. Spoiler alert: You're probably not going to kill him 7215/2-IGN 'a great way to show the potential of how far gaming can go and what it can do'

8466	0	a	This is the 'nice' version of my review. I have one that is the 'roasty' version but im still finding a place for it so i wont get in trouble for 'not following the Rules and Guidelines'. Ill comment the place on my profile comments when i have a safe place for it (and trust me. its got some HUGE roasting and memes in it) but just because this is a 'nice' review doesn't mean its a GOOD review. I personally think this game SUCKS. Heres a list why.  -Its pay to win -Bad controls -Bad enemy dialogue -Confusing  Yes i know. Short. But hey. Like i said. The 'roasty' version is MUCH more detailed. This game is basically Trove but cringier. And Trove is cringy enough.
8467	0	a	After the devs sold this game to Kabam, it was all over. Pay-to-win like no other. Used to be a fantastic game, it's pretty much ruined now. Stay away until someone better takes over.

8472	0	a	Realm of the Mad God is broken. As soon as you start the game and see the main menu, you can tell right away that it's unplayable. The menu screen appears off screen somewhere. There are no settings or options at all. If you are able to actually get into the game, there are endless problems with the controls. In short, nothing works as it should. It's simply unusable software.  Realm of the Mad God is unbearable.
8473	0	a	A boring normal retro RPG that seems to have many pay-to-win qualities.
8474	0	a	I've never seen so many things locked unless you pay real money... Its nearly everything wow.
8475	0	a	Its bad
8476	0	a	Realm of the Mad god, It is a wide pixelated realm of chaos and my dungeons to travel into. It is rather nice of a game, other than all the Spam Bots runnin' a muck, like the servants of Oryx the Mad God himself. This game has many good and bad classes to play alike. As well as Well thought out beasts of the realms, as well as good loot and boosters await in every realm.  Now onto the downsides of this game.  Realm of the Mad god, Sure it is magnificent in it's own ways, but it lacks the proper sound qualities of the beasts that travel around the realms. Most hold very few sounds, yet alone none at all. This game needs updates of sound, as well as the connection issues it has time to time itself. I know this is on the side of Kabam or Wildshadow, whichever holds it, cause I got one of the best connections around my general area. It as well can be irritating of it's rather Unique 1 life scenario, when you die you lose everything in your inventory, that is if you don't have the amulet of such. I also have the attention to how you only contain 1 Vault Chest in the Vault. It seems slightly unfair that you can only hold up to 8 items in that as well, I honestly think the chest would be better with more space at least, 12 spaces for the center line at least. Also to come to my attention that there is a lack of fair prices, even on sale hours, it seems to still be too much for a first timer of the realms. Fresh heroes need good gear to start them off at least.  All these are my visions of the game. My total tally as a result of recommendation?  I would NOT recommend it, for all the downward results of this game, sorry Wildshadow, and Kabam.

8488	0	a	This game seems ok if you're the kind of person who likes to play an MMO-style Gauntlet Legends game for about 10 minutes then give up. It's free to play, but the Freemium payments are, as to be expected, relentless and lock out just about anything that makes the game playable for extended periods. 1 Inventory, 1 tiny bank, 1 playable character. No access to any dungeon past a certain level without Freemium keys. And the cherry on top? If your player dies they're GONE for good. No resets, no respawns. Your dude dies, you're back to lvl 1 with a whole new character and anything you were carrying goes too. There's much better free-to-play MMOs on the market than this one.
8489	0	a	This game officially sucks.
8490	0	a	Realm of the Mad God resembles the classic pixel MMORPG oriented-game with some bullet hell implementations. It can be extremely fun especially when played with a massive community, but when you die you literally lose every progress for your current character. It kills the effort of building your character up if the point is to simply die and start all over again. Not to mention the pain of watching your time and effort going down the drain just because a lag made you die by a single hovering blob of bullet.  Overall, this game is great if you love challenges and taking risks, but it isn't ideal if you're more interested in spilling all your investments into a character.
8491	0	a	Cheating and greed, &amp; Kabam buyout have messed this game up beyond repair!

Deca might make things better, and hopefully they will, and maybe it's just my computer, but this game is notorious for lag, so I blame the game. Hopefully you enjoy this game as it is one of a kind - with it's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ loot system, terrible community, but addictive perma death aspect. This game IS an amazing game,and I bet ill be back on in tomorrow. However, if you easily get annoyed, and/or are one of those annoying 6 year old CoD players, don't even TOUCH this game. Seriously. You'll get ear cancer (Is that a thing?) along with anyone within a 20 mile radius. If you're a fairly casual player, and you're okay with deaths, even it it's COMPLETELY unfair, go ahead. However, don't touch any of the equipment in the Nexus. It's COMPLETELY not worth it. 9 Dollars for an Acclaim? No thanks.
8497	0	a	This game is AIDS.
8498	0	a	This game is one of the most pay to win games I have ever seen in my life. Unless you are planning on paying money, don't play this game.
8499	0	a	Ok..... for an hour until you recieve,complaints about your name that you cant change unless you pay 1000 coins that would cost around £5,so many spam messages about discounts on sets that you can buy with real money, so many links in the realm spawn, extreme lag when you fight a group of monsters, overall a typical f2p (free to play) game that will waste a few hours of your life playing this piece of sh*it.     4/10  
8500	0	a	STUPID LAG TERRIBLE LAG dont get ut kills you for no reason its stupiud
8501	0	a	I am really torn on this game. Such a great idea, so much potential, and really just a fun little game that would have been fine at a $3-$5.00 sticker price and ingame cosmetic purchases.  As is...it is Pay 2 Win to the max, where you not only have a permadeath mechanic but dying results in the loss of an item you paid real world money for. Certainly fun as a free game to check out for an hour or two of play, but you can't compete without real money at the meta game and Mac's Corner will NEVER reccomend a Pay to Win game. To watch a playthrough you can check out the following Let's Play Video from Mac's Corner'   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VLX6DMv-OY&amp;feature=youtu.be 
8502	0	a	There are a lot of negative ends to this system. Chat spam is prominant. The players are generally greedy and uncooperative. Bosses are insanely difficult. Currency is very fragile and hard to get. YOU GET 1 LIFE ONLY!
8503	0	a	This game made no sense to me. The 'objective' of the game was to acquire the most amount of loot but, other than that what is the point? Dry game with very low depth.
8504	0	a	If this game didn't have permadeath, then I would've absolutely fell in love with this game.
8505	0	a	THIS WONT RUN AND I HAVE A SWEET PC

8510	0	a	Honestly... it's not that fun, and when you're moving around, your character automatically just runs in that direction and keeps going and you don't stop unless you force it. And the combat system is pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.... the time between when you click, and when you shoot of off by like 2 seconds and it screws you up a lot.
8511	0	a	Its heartbreaking for me to write this review, because I used to love this game. DO NOT PICKUP THIS GAME The concept was simple, a bullethell, minimalist, perma death MMO, and it was great. The problem came when KABAM bought the game, turned it into a pay-to-win cash wall, and the sent the game into its downward death spiral. All of the good developers that were on the team abandoned this shipwreck, so any new content is either reskins of current items, or flat-out broken items, for real money of course. 1000 hours (500 on steam, 500 on browser) wasted.
8512	0	a	Even Jerry hates this game. His Llamas do too. Down vote.
8513	0	a	it was fun untill the stupid pop up at the begging broke my game
8514	0	a	this game is not free to play. every time you open the game a window pops up to purchace starter pac and you cant close it without starting the transaction. once you enter the town its floded with trade talk which you dont seem to be able to minimise or anything, takes up the whole ♥♥♥♥ING screen.  dont get this its ♥♥♥♥
8515	0	a	Couldn't complete tutorial, then game crashed, couldn't start up again.   -10/10   Would un-install again.
8516	0	a	Its really hard to get gold and everything, and it gets biring in the first hour.
8517	0	a	I used to like it, but I played it again and now, that Kabam bought it, the game is ruined. It's totally pay-to-win. EVERY single screen you are in the game tries to make you spend money in something. Every. Single. Screen. I mean, seriosly? Is Kabam so desperate about earning money that they sacrifice gameplay? Don't install this game, there are tons of better games out there.
8518	0	a	P2W. Dont waste your time with it.
8519	0	a	DONT BUY THIS GAME -filled wth ♥♥♥♥♥♥s -not better than minecraft -pay to win ♥♥♥♥  wow this game is ♥♥♥♥- FaZe i want my virginity back- Wade Wilson  Overall: D- because it has a tutorial
8520	0	a	-You hold left click and run in circles -hit space occasionally for a special move -turn EVERY enemy to DUST -level up a ton -die from being overwhelmed -permadeath.exe -make a new character -RIP in peace twinkletoes the third -uninstall the game  This game is kinda like sonic. As a kid you would enjoy this game a ton and find it entertaining. As you get older you realize that you have no idea what the ♥♥♥♥ is going on and that youre just mindlessly playing and pressing random ♥♥♥ buttons while a ♥♥♥♥ ton of stuff flies by and tries to kill you. Don't waste your time with this. Ever. There's no actual quests or skill trees or anything and half loot you find you can't use because it doesn't match your class. This game is ♥♥♥♥.
8521	0	a	It's built to take your money. If you die, welcome back to lvl one. You only get any worth while stuff after you have spent your money, and you have limited character choices. As said before untill you spend money.

8525	0	a	You're better off playing this game in the Browser than through Steam. Why? The 'Beginner Package' will pop up after you make it to the main city for players, part of it will be off-screen so you can't close the ♥♥♥♥er, and since you can't close it, you can't play the game.  I'm Not Recommending the Steam Version for this Mad idea....  If you like games you can't play on Steam, then please knock yourself out - you'll have a blast!
8526	0	a	A dull grind from which no light can escape.
8527	0	a	Laggy as ♥♥♥♥, regardless of your PC specs and Internet speeds/QoS/distance between user and server.
8528	0	a	I have no idea what's going on with this game, nor how to play. Also, there's literally one music and it loops on and on and on and on…  Don't bother much.
8529	0	a	This game is horrible, the concept is good, but it's just so bad, so many wizards, Much Disapoint, Much Wizard, Wow
8530	0	a	It looks like a really cool game on the outside, though I didn't play much, what I did, I didn't enjoy. For the first couple of play-throughs, the soliciting of those DLC as soon as you enter the main city, and the death screen, all went offscreen. There is no pause menu, the only option you get is to turn the sound on and off in the main menu meaning that you have to exit the game. For me anyway, there was a ton of lag to where after I use my wasd keys, it would be a few seconds before my character would move. I died a lot because of this. The fact that when you are in the main city that the text goes halfway up the screen and there are tons of gold spammers in it is very annoying.  This would make a great single player game, but unfortunately it's not.
8531	0	a	I hate this terrible game it does not capture my attenion 
8532	0	a	Personal Rating: 2/10  Honestly, I wasn't expecting much from this. It's a browser game standard, and not the good ones like Rebuild. I have very little fun with this game, be it the fact that anybody on the server can just swoop by the hard fought battle, scavenge the good stuff and be on his way without a simple 'Hello, may I have this etc...'  So, I wouldn't play this game, I'd prefer to play Crate Simulator. Fun.
8533	0	a	I hate this game a lot because I had only 1 charactor and when I died it wouldn't let me choose any other charactors &gt;:( I hate you Wild Shadow Studios more like Lame Shadow Studios

8539	0	a	While it is a good game, the amount of cons overshadow the pros. For the sake of making a point...  Pros +Fun gameplay +Friendly community (Mostly) +Diverse gameplay +Lots to do  Cons -Input lag unless you have a very good computer (Very big issue with such a fast-pased game) -Stat Potions are everything (They're not very easy to get if you don't have a powerful character) -Very difficult unless you plan to spend over at least $100! -Everything, EVERYTHING, is heavily overpriced -Perma-Death (While not the worst thing, the excessive difficulty makes this kind of an issue for many people - myself included) -It's actually a flash game (Just the Steam version is a client version) -Excessively powerful enemies (It's easy to die shortly after starting as even the first enemies do WAY too much damage)  There is much more to say about both sides but what I've put should provide enough of a view as to what makes me not recommend this game.  P.S. This game was MUCH better when WildShadow was developing it but they have since been bought out by Kabam and now this game feels more like a cash cow instead of a real game. Just my sight on everything
8540	0	a	Honestly, ♥♥♥♥ game. The interface is confusing and there are LOADS of bugs. I couldn't even get past the starting area because the GUI kept freaking. 0/10 do not play.

8542	0	a	This game sucks ♥♥♥♥. its a pay to win. if you get hella good, then die, you may aswell just neck yourself.
8543	0	a	If you want to play a ♥♥♥♥ action RPG game with ♥♥♥♥ graphics, ♥♥♥♥ music, and ♥♥♥♥ gameplay, then play this trainwreck of a game which has good concepts but poor execution. If you want to play a good action RPG, here's what you do:  Step #1: Put fifteen to twenty dollars in your Steam wallet.  Step #2: Go to the Ys: The Oath in Felghana store page.  Step #3: Buy Ys: The Oath in Felghana, install it, and play the ♥♥♥♥ out of it. You'll thank me later.
8544	0	a	Bugs in controls and optimisation problems, work a bit more on this game.

8561	0	a	Do you like: 100% pay to win? Unfair difficulties? Losing all of your items? The Realm of the Mad God is the game for you! We got: -Ear bleeding music that repeats every 3 seconds! -Unfair and frusterating enemies! -Impossobly difficult bosses! -Tons of items that you can get in 2 ways:  -Grind countless hours long  -Pay money -Losing all items+chareter on death! -unability to gain money in-game! -Way overpriced items! -A shop in the lobby to brag about what you DONT have! -A community made out of sh*tbags! -And a graveyard to show how much time you've wasted!  Key Features:  -Constantly play with fear from death. -Extremely slow progress if you dont pay money. -Unability to purchase ANYTHING. -Lots of pets, items, skins, classes, dongeons, weapons and armor that all cost money. -We constantly try to kill you at any moment. -We constantly want to make your credit card get to 0$ eventually.  'f*ck kabam' 'Its a shop-not a game' '2/10' 'The game aims for children and thier parents credit card status' 'shopping simulator' 'Everything just costs money'  Enjoy our 'game'!
8562	0	a	Gay cancer ♥♥♥♥ full of little kids kys
8563	0	a	I tried this for about an hour. Much like Minecraft, it is a good way to test if you have some form of autism.  Playing for more than an hour might require a visit to a doctor. Mundane to the extreme.
8564	0	a	This game, is some what good, but it seems like an iphone game. I mean the graphicsare pixalated which seems lazy, but I guess that's the artstyle, so cant really complain. the game is a beta, or something like that, and ALOT of things are missing, like HOW THE ♥♥♥♥ AM I SUPPOSED TO BEAT A DUNGEON WHEN IT'S NOT COMPLETE!?!?!?!??!?!?!??!?!?!? THIS IS THE ONE OTHER DUNGEON THEY CAME UP WITH AND I CAN'T DO JACK ♥♥♥♥!!!!! There is little to no gameplay PLUS it shows lag WITH NO SIGNS other than when your character dosen't respond. the game can't pause, which is annoying when you try to put items down, which sometimes glitches where the item so it ♥♥♥♥ing stays in the middle of the screen where you can't pick it up, and the WORST part about it is that free to play license. IT TOOK ME 99 MINUTES TO EARN A PIECE, ONE ♥♥♥♥ING PIECE OF GOLD, so you have to buy anything you want unless it's a class which can be earned by grinding little guys or an easy boss. there are ♥♥♥♥tons of more reasons but, that would take WAY too long to write up. don't play unless you have nothing better to do or it gets 20 more updates that aren't just rare pets, keys, or ♥♥♥♥ that dosen't matter to actual gameplay.
8565	0	a	this is the worst game that i ever play!

8570	0	a	Makes me rage really, really, REALLY hard. Simple and addictive gameplay though... IF you like this sort of thing.
8571	0	a	This game is so not for me. To my knowledge the only way to make 'coins' in this game is to pay real money. It seems to be a grinding type of game too, which i'm not a fan of that style of game. (Grinding=killing multiple enemies over and over just to gain a level). This game takes it to a WHOLE new level though, this might as well be called, 'Grind Simulator' Realm of the Grind god' 'Grinding of the Mad God' or any other name you can think of with Grind in it. I wasted 2 hours or so into 1 character, he died at level 12, and I only got 12 'fame'. I litterally can't buy ♥♥♥♥ with 12 fame, I can clearly tell I wasted my time If I am wrong on some things, please tell me, I want to see if this game CAN be good, right now it seems like a endless grind-fest...  TL;DR If you LOVE grinding and not getting good rewards for stuff, then this game is a perfect match for you. Don't like grinding? ... RUN

8573	0	a	This game is kind of horrible because i cannot log into my web account.
8574	0	a	Starts off good, and then you die.
8575	0	a	Maybe I would like it if someone could tell me how to get into the actual game. I have spent a few minutes just trying to get to the game. Everytime I hit play it brings up a character selection screen with no way to select any character. I try and back out of the character selection screen but there is only one problem. THERE IS NO BACK BUTTON. I'm not joking evertime you want to get out of the character selection screen you would have to exit out and start over.  Again my review may change if someone could tell me how to get to the actual game.
8576	0	a	Horrible, i have multiple friends who have some obsession over it i tried it and hated it more than any game i have played previous. If you like generic 2d rougue like games, i guess it is good then. I like MMOs same as the next guy, but this is just bad.
8577	0	a	This game is nothing more than an cashgrab. Avoid at all costs. No replay value, no fun, no reason to waste the bandwidth to download this festering shitpile.
8578	0	a	dis game is so fooking hart
8579	0	a	I did not have a good experience with this game. The controls are broken as all hell, and it seems to be one of those 'play-to-win' games, as almost everything requires you to make a transaction. The game is a broken, terrible mess, and I cant reccomend it to anyone.
8580	0	a	Pay to win.

8592	0	a	If you like pointless games where you run around constantly being attacked with no fullscreen option so you're constantly clicking outside the screen, bringing other windows to the fore front, you'll love this little anal goblin. I went to create a name and the box was cut off inside the window with no choice of closing it forcing me to exit and restart first time around. Then I finally got into the game and quickly came to find what a slice of turd it was. No logic whatsoever. Just run around being shot from every direction by little groups of characters. It didn't matter though, my health barely depleted even letting my character sit a while being attacked. I made it to level 3 just by picking off a few and had the honor of on screen popups constantly interrupting my pure hatred for this pointless nonsense. I've had more fun fixing lawnmowers.

Straight up fried. ♥♥♥♥. And another weird ccuunntt talking about how he writes pewdiepie fan fic like bruh, we get it, you like naruto.
8602	0	a	I can't even play this game due to the large amount of desync, 200 times more than the desync in Payday 2. You use the web browser and you start off with absolute ♥♥♥♥ stuff and it's hard as ♥♥♥♥ to progress.
8603	0	a	Multiboxers(hackers) they had years to fix this and they didn't RWT Bots that spam you links so scamming websites. The devs don't bother to block this either. Tried to stop duping but ended up making it worse - you can't even log in half the time because they accuse you of cheating  
8604	0	a	I really dont like this game. It's just another 'RPG' where you spam click in an 'Open' world. Its also another game where the devs are desperate for money, so they put up really stupid stuff. Instead I would recommend Great Dungeon In the Sky, its a better game made but the same people.
8605	0	a	Really repetitive and annoying, personally I don't like it. The uninstall works just fine tho.
8606	0	a	Pros  -very hard but still fair  -and well tahts basically all  Cons  -micro-transactions  -permadeath (aka all the stuff you purchased IS GONE FOREVER)  -the gameplay is terrible  -play only is you are an idiot!  -the game tries to keep you into it stealing you're money  -DON'T EVER PAY A SINGLE CENT! YOU'LL REGRET IT!  -if you ever enter the final level jsut quit you'll die in 3 seconds  - ign gives this game a 11/10
8607	0	a	Goat Simulator is less buggy than the Steam version of this game for me. (And Goat Simulator is intentionally buggy because it's fun.)  I'm not sure it's this buggy for everyone, but if it is, just use another website or client to play RotMG.  This is the one game I actually recommend cheating in, because of how ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ly small your field of view is. So honestly, just go download a hacked client or something.  No, really. Your field of view allows you to see what a half blind person would see in real life. You can't at all dodge like this either, by the way.  Aside from all these bugs and how stupid the field of view is, I definitely can recommend this game, although it's a complete rage game, it's very fun to play.
8608	0	a	No. Just no...
8609	0	a	Oh, this game. I played it online a lot back in 2012 or so, and the gameplay is still cool enough. There's a huge bone to pick with the Nexus, though, and that is why I don't like it.  Fact is, there are no items that are available to buy without 'coins', which can only be earned by getting a credit card/Paypal/Google checkout and forking out some cash. Absolutely zero. This should be really altered in favor of free items, especially since permadeath can and will occur fast. Apart from that, it's a good game, but stay away if you don't like money-grabs.

8618	0	a	I played it for a bit, soon to realize, no drops of any kind can be sold for anything. you can only get gold buy actually paying real money for it. this is just another pay to play crap shoot like all the others. sure you can get your fun out of it for free, but don't bother spending a dime, waste of time. also if you are dumb and bought into this, I'm sure you will find if you die, you loose your items items are only safe in your vault. something they also make you pay for. you only get 6 slots, the room is full of other chests for purchase. its a shame of a game, FULL of SPAMMING BOTS IN NEXUS!! TONS OF CHEATERS AND PEOPLE BOT FARMING....ITS A HORRIBLE GAME, all they want is your money, for bad graphics and very limited repetitive game play. 1/10

8620	0	a	Realm of the Mad God the first 'Bullethell MMO' this game is not really bullethell also its not a go(o)d Game. Its the bugiest game I played. The playerchar doesnt move sometimes when you press w, a, s or d the same with attacks. But the problem is that the game is very boring. I rather play brilliant bob then this Game and Brilliant Bob is a REALLY BAD GAME.
8621	0	a	This is a great game I loved it. I don't play on steam but on flashplayer, but I do not recommend this game just because of how bad the community is. Please do not even try to play this game if you can't handle toxic people. Who when you ask them about something ANYTHING they say kill yourself. Its horrible to see where this community went I just wish the people weren't so stupid.
8622	0	a	ok, ok i have a gtx 960 and the game sometimes drops to 35 fps, really? no seriously are you kidding me?
8623	0	a	Legit won't even load  0/10 would not reccomend
8624	0	a	Nope, you die you lose literally everything, levels and all. ain't fun considering how loot drops work
8625	0	a	Im not a fan of this game, i feel no point in it... this game is run by in game purchases and that ruin any game really.. pay to win= waist of time
8626	0	a	i just saw abunch of men
8627	0	a	Welp. I kinda like this game but I cant reccomend it. Soooooooooooooooooo Realm of the mad god is a top down RPG game with A ♥♥♥♥ TON of microtransactions. Kill me. You can choose alot of classes and the one im baseing this review with is the knight considering ive played a while with it. Now ive played a bit of this game so I could make a better review.  So this game is not completley TRASH but its not the best. Any fans of the game im sorry. Again you dont have to put in money which dont worry I didnt do, but holy crap you baseiclly cant play otherwise. I am currently a level 20 knight with very good defense and offense and I cant stand 1 minute in certain sections, and its not just my skill level. So what do you do? You pay a lot of money to (Goes back to first review) make you feel like your good and progressing but really arent. Now lets say they removed the micro transactions so you could get all these items natrually by playing the game and make it cost a little bit. It would be waaay better. So in the game you need to go around defeating bosses for quests and level up and eventually after you have killed all his servants the mad gods castle will spawn. Now once you get through that raid you get to fight him and kill him. You have health potions which will regen your health and also mana potions which will regen your mana. Now your mana is for pressing space to use your charecters ability.    Section 2: Tricks. While I was editing this it turns out there is a trick! yay. That trick being if you are in a sticky situation (which you are alot in this game) you can warp out and leave your freinds to die.    Section 3: Reccomendation. Well, its a free game so theres that. You can pick it up if you want but overall I would reccomend you do not put money or time into this game. Maybe if you have nothing to do you can pick it up but otherwise no.   Section End: Rating. Well as you know (if you have read my other reviews and you should! If you do it would be kind of you to give them a good rating considering I put time into them but I guess you dont have to.) I give games an extra point if they are free so I give this game a 5/10. Average.    Edit: So, stupid me forgeting to put that this game is a permerdeath game so if you die with those items you spent money on, they are gone. How anoying is that? Also, I felt like I should go into detail on me saying that you feel like your progressing but you really arent doesnt just aply to the microtransactions, it aplys to the game. So me (a lvl 20 knight) will end up wandering around the place looking for a boss to kill or a raid to do. But the main problem of this issue is that once you reach the max lvl 20, the wonder (I guess you could say) goes away. After that all you do is either try to unlock new classes (which is not very fun to do) or try to get new items. (which takes forever) All to lead up to the final castle with oryx which is probably the best part of this game. Now I will go a little in depth on the oryx fight and his castle. The reason this is probably the best part of the game is that it takes everyone from the server (which is a lot of people by the way) and ♥♥♥♥♥ them out into a castle. The cool thing about this castle is that even low levels have acess to it. Which means they can fight along the higher levels too. Here the game gives some teamwork action! (which is what this raid needed.) Now, im not saying that this game dosent have any 'teamwork action' in it. You feel like your traversing through a dungeon and helping the lower levels make it through. (if you dont want to do the castle just yet you can warp) But oryx is where it all falls down. Your going to NEED microtransaction items to beat this hunk of junk because holy hell you cant beat him otherwise. His attacks are to strong and your damage is too low. Camping around other players wont help because you will get seperated alot. After all that he drops some armor or something for everyone to rush to and pick up. So what is the point of this long edit? Progression. That is what this game lacks. You can play for hours and not get ANYWHERE execpt killing bosses that wont help you in the end. Now I will proably continue playing this game if not to help my freind level up and crap. Also that can get really boring. So yes the progression system in this game is TRASH, some people may not think so but they are usuly people who spend money on this game. My rating will stay the same as it is, my opinon on this game has not changed and it will not. Sorry for this wall of text. Good Day.    Quick Message: One of the main problems with this game is that it is boring. Boring to grind up items. Boring to try to reach max fame. Boring to fight a boss you have fought tons of times before just to level up. Once the wonder of leveling is gone there really is nothing left other than to kill oryx.

8664	0	a	Thanks for sending me a copy paste message, not reading my ticket, and telling me that its not your fault when the servers lag and I die! #Bestsupportteam2k16    Your case status has been updated... Case #: 11771 Deca Games OÜ SEP 19, 2016 | 09:55PM UTC Hello,   thank you for contacting us regarding reviving your character. Unfortunately, we will not revive characters.   When you die in Realm of the Mad God, you will lose your progress and items on that specific Character. Not to worry, this is a natural part of the game! You will earn Fame as a result of your death. Fame can be used to buy certain items in-game and is also a requirement for completing Class Quests.   Once a Character has died, you will be unable to play them again, but you are free to make a new character.   While we completely understand the frustration this loss has caused you, our support team is not able to revive or grant back fallen characters in any way, nor are we able to recover any inventory items held by that character at the time of their death.   While we understand that sometimes circumstances outside of your direct control may have led to the loss of your character, please know that the 'perma-death' feature is a central mechanic of Realm of the Mad God, and is considered to be working as intended.    Best regards,  The Deca Team  
8665	0	a	loved it! super enjoyed the mega ugly graphics and horrible gameplay

8669	0	a	Its fun but Pay to Play
8670	0	a	For a free game sure its a tad fun... but it's incredibly boring... The same thing over and over, also it's really hard to actually play without purchasing with real money chests so you can actually store things or have multiple accounts, and even then it's still not that good

8672	0	a	Realm of the Mad God. Ah what can I say, you used to be a fun and addicting game but now look at you. Realm of the Mad God is like that teacher you thought was really hot back in highschool, but then you saw her at the grocery store 4 years after and she was buying laxatives. (Also there is this glitch where sometimes a red block will appear on your screen blocking your inventory and darkening your screen, it also does not allow you to click)
8673	0	a	This is a pay to win game and the amount of avaratisments is unbeleval not only that but it has so meny bugs and gliches.

8675	0	a	Great game!
8676	0	a	Just a terrible game. Every single time you die, your level resets to 1.  Find a different game to play that's not this one.  I also hate games on Steam that need you to create an account for their game [With a few exeptions like 'Town of Salem']
8677	0	a	This game is a piece of crap,a waste of money for ANYTHING you buy just a buncha money hungry people BEGGING you to spend your money ahah NOPE
8678	0	a	Graphic is not good.
8679	0	a	This game is good if you want to play some games that bad pc's can run. If you have a slow pc you should play this. You can play it if you have good pc 2 but i don't think that this game is that good of a game. 7/10 I don't recommend you this game.
8680	0	a	Another reinforcement of the fact I don't like rouge-likes/lites.  And the real-time nature of the combat merely adds a new layer of frustration; Dying because I made a mistake is infuriating, but acceptable. Dying because of internet lag is NOT. EVER.  The F2P almost saved this title from the q, but don't be fooled: this game has a price tag, which you will PAY every single time you die: TIME.
8681	0	a	this game gave me a stomach ache
8682	0	a	Fun if you like looking at about five pixels changing colour on your screen
8683	0	a	Wish i would allow 12 year olds! Had to lie to play the game!
8684	0	a	not good. low quality (game and visual) truly for kids 5-10 year old
8685	0	a	this game is so bad kill the creators
8686	0	a	this game is really really bad and does not run well it ddoesn't load and once it does the content is horrible
8687	0	a	So far I only have 27 hours of play time so understand I'm not an expert.. It is very easy to reach max level in this game (takes well under an hour if you follow a fame train around) but once you are there you will most likely have bad stats. To get better stats you need to die, recreate your character and level it again and again in the hopes of receiving good stats. Even once you've finally managed to get good stats the only way to get good gear is to play in the very dangerous (since if you die, your character disappears) area known as the Godlands. You will grind there for eternity hoping to get enough stat-increasing potions to make you less likely to die. Then you've basically beat the game. In short - it is very difficult and time consuming to break into the stage where you can play the 'end game' content with a character that does decent damage and isn't too likely to die.
8688	0	a	Sucks. Hard controls when you try to look. Sucks.
8689	0	a	I have a store. It's a Japanese sushi joint. I take a hit from it every morning. It get's me all the women I need. But they take up all my green. I think they're really mean. Except when they lick my beans. Happy Easter!

8693	0	a	Neat concept. You go in, level up a lot, permadeath... However, it's clear that the devs are simply money hungry as nearly EVERYTHING must be purchased with no potential of earning anything.

8695	0	a	According to all known laws of aviation,   there is no way a bee should be able to fly.   Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground.   The bee, of course, flies anyway   because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.   Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black.   Ooh, black and yellow! Let's shake it up a little.   Barry! Breakfast is ready!   Ooming!   Hang on a second.   Hello?   - Barry? - Adam?   - Oan you believe this is happening? - I can't. I'll pick you up.   Looking sharp.   Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those.   Sorry. I'm excited.   Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son.   A perfect report card, all B's.   Very proud.   Ma! I got a thing going here.   - You got lint on your fuzz. - Ow! That's me!   - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. - Bye!   Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house!   - Hey, Adam. - Hey, Barry.   - Is that fuzz gel? - A little. Special day, graduation.   Never thought I'd make it.   Three days grade school, three days high school.   Those were awkward.   Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive.   You did come back different.   - Hi, Barry. - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.   - Hear about Frankie? - Yeah.   - You going to the funeral? - No, I'm not going.   Everybody knows, sting someone, you die.   Don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead.   I guess he could have just gotten out of the way.   I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day.   That's why we don't need vacations.   Boy, quite a bit of pomp… under the circumstances.   - Well, Adam, today we are men. - We are!   - Bee-men. - Amen!   Hallelujah!   Students, faculty, distinguished bees,   please welcome Dean Buzzwell.   Welcome, New Hive Oity graduating class of…   …9:15.   That concludes our ceremonies.   And begins your career at Honex Industries!   Will we pick ourjob today?   I heard it's just orientation.   Heads up! Here we go.   Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times.   - Wonder what it'll be like? - A little scary.   Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco   and a part of the Hexagon Group.   This is it!   Wow.   Wow.   We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life   to get to the point where you can work for your whole life.   Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.   Our top-secret formula   is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured   into this soothing sweet syrup   with its distinctive golden glow you know as…   Honey!   - That girl was hot. - She's my cousin!   - She is? - Yes, we're all cousins.   - Right. You're right. - At Honex, we constantly strive   to improve every aspect of bee existence.   These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology.   - What do you think he makes? - Not enough.   Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman.   - What does that do? - Oatches that little strand of honey   that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions.   Oan anyone work on the Krelman?   Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know   that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot.   But choose carefully   because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life.   The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that.   What's the difference?   You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off   in 27 million years.   So you'll just work us to death?   We'll sure try.   Wow! That blew my mind!   “What's the difference? How can you say that?   One job forever? That's an insane choice to have to make.   I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life.   But, Adam, how could they never have told us that?   Why would you question anything? We're bees.   We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth.   You ever think maybe things work a little too well here?   Like what? Give me one example.   I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about.   Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach.   Wait a second. Oheck it out.   - Hey, those are Pollen Jocks! - Wow.   I've never seen them this close.   They know what it's like outside the hive.   Yeah, but some don't come back.   - Hey, Jocks! - Hi, Jocks!   You guys did great!   You're monsters! You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!   - I wonder where they were. - I don't know.   Their day's not planned.   Outside the hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what.   You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that.   Right.   Look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime.   It's just a status symbol. Bees make too much of it.   Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it.   Those ladies? Aren't they our cousins too?   Distant. Distant.   Look at these two.   - Oouple of Hive Harrys. - Let's have fun with them.   It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock.   Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom!   He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me!   - Oh, my! - I never thought I'd knock him out.   What were you doing during this?   Trying to alert the authorities.   I can autograph that.   A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades?   Yeah. Gusty.   We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow.   - Six miles, huh? - Barry!   A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it.   - Maybe I am. - You are not!   We're going 0900 at J-Gate.   What do you think, buzzy-boy? Are you bee enough?   I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means.   Hey, Honex!   Dad, you surprised me.   You decide what you're interested in?   - Well, there's a lot of choices. - But you only get one.   Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day?   Son, let me tell you about stirring.   You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around.   You get yourself into a rhythm. It's a beautiful thing.   You know, Dad, the more I think about it,   maybe the honey field just isn't right for me.   You were thinking of what, making balloon animals?   That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger.   Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey!   - Barry, you are so funny sometimes. - I'm not trying to be funny.   You're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer!   - You're gonna be a stirrer? - No one's listening to me!   Wait till you see the sticks I have.   I could say anything right now. I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!   Let's open some honey and celebrate!   Maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae.   Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody “dawg!   I'm so proud.   - We're starting work today! - Today's the day.   Oome on! All the good jobs will be gone.   Yeah, right.   Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal…   - Is it still available? - Hang on. Two left!   One of them's yours! Oongratulations! Step to the side.   - What'd you get? - Picking crud out. Stellar!   Wow!   Oouple of newbies?   Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!   Make your choice.   - You want to go first? - No, you go.   Oh, my. What's available?   Restroom attendant's open, not for the reason you think.   - Any chance of getting the Krelman? - Sure, you're on.   I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.   Wax monkey's always open.   The Krelman opened up again.   What happened?   A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He's dead. Another dead one.   Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.   Dead from the neck up.

8708	0	a	  My Thoughts on Realm of the Mad God  -I dont like Pixel Games like this  -Boring  -Has Potential   - Not Gr8
8709	0	a	Walking is utterly painful to do as it moves by itself 95% of the time. There is not enough help and i felt as if i were lost in plain darkness. There is no point to this game and once you die you lose all of your stuff. Tisk tisk.
8710	0	a	(i have played only for some minutes -about 30 mins- so take my review as seriously as u want)  Noooope!  cons: -No real tutorial -Cant understand whats going on -Annoying music cause it doesnt change and its not background...its very loud! -In my opinion camera should be way higher.My eyes hurt... (this may can change idk so plz if this is important for you search for the answer but default camera is very low and near the players in my opinion) -Generally seems a bad game cause -not speaking about the gameplay -,is very 'fast paced'.You start,immediatly hit play,choose server,class go for a tutorial aaandd boom!You are in a weird island and monsters attack u constantly.Thats it no escape.I died then created another hero only to see i spawned in a 'city' i couldnt escape as well.So i entered some weird portals and went again in this island i didnt know what to do...so i exeted game and wrote this review.It just feels like none puts care into it everything happens so fast and no tutorial....i am confused not gonna give this 2nd chance...  pros: -nice idea    again...Nooope!
8711	0	a	Extremely buggy and badly optimized.  Any popups appear in the bottom right of corner of the screen, and I can't close them because the 'X' is out of my screen. Also, the overall design is very hard to use, and does not have back buttons at times where it should have.
8712	0	a	didn't like it, it was way to glitchy with the fullscreen and so, i got mad at the game and i dont like being mad at a game.

8719	0	a	Lol just look at the ♥♥♥♥ing screenshots. It is also only 39mb. Lol WTF???
8720	0	a	THis game is terrible. Unbalanced, and the steam version has input lag, which makes this experience impossible. The loot drops for your class are next to none, and the swarms ofmonsters are impossible to kill. The questsare too few and simple. There is no story, npcs, and overall, unless you just have a ton of money to spend, this is a terrible game. Do not get it at all costs.It is a waste of time.
8721	0	a	Not my type of game, but I guess its good
8722	0	a	No antispam, bad animations 2 problems making this game very bad

8728	0	a	It's pay to win. Also if you die you lose everything.
8729	0	a	I think that most likely this is one of those games that try to take all your money, you can only have 3 characters at a time, if a character dies, you LOSE EVERYTHING (I guess I haven't tested if you get to keep the items you buy, BUT I am not willing to pay 3 dollars for a set of armor and maybe lose it) everything is overpriced, they make it hard to get items without buying them, because the world is mad and action is everywhere, so if you want to grab an item from a dead person, you have to do it really quick AND most of the items suck, and 90% you couldn't use it if you wanted too, options stink, some good things about it is that it reminds me of the old arcade games, (action is everywhere), and its free except for almost every item. the only thing you do in the game basically is walk and shoot. 4/10
8730	0	a	Kabam ruined this game. They bought it and they forced P2W on us all. The game is no longer something I would recommend.
8731	0	a	Yeah, they have ruined the game with P2W and laggy servers, dont bother..
8732	0	a	Used to be really fun. Then Kabam bought it and made it Pay-to-win which promptly ruined it. *slow clap* Well done Kabam, you managed to ruin a great game.
8733	0	a	this game sucks -123456543234565434564345643456435434564345643245678987654345679876543456787654345678987654356787654567876/10
8734	0	a	I didnt like that it is perma death becuase you could lose everything you worked so hard for. It is very frustrating when you are trying to get to 6/8. Its a good game if it wasnt perma death... atleast let us keep our items.. In conclusion i think you should try it out if you dont rage much.. if you do however It WILL NOT be a fun game.
8735	0	a	Honestly, nothing too special. Most of you probably expect a lackluster review about how this game has potential, but really, unless it comes out with some really good updates this game will no longer exist by next year, because of hackers, spammers, afkers, and trolls. This is really a joke game, especially if you have some friends to play with it may be fun, but soloing this game is pretty awful. 5/10.
8736	0	a	Realm of the Mad God, in short is a unique and addictive experience in co-op bullet hell shooting that you need to try. If only on private fan-made servers. Note; I mostly played it in a browser.  Story: There isn't much story at all, at least within the game. Since the same types of enemies spawn within each RNG realm, and the action-packed gameplay is the main show, the lack of it or even lore fits well. All that is ever hinted at within the game is each quest boss's dialogue. (This dialogue is exempt from a few, I think.) 8?/10  Visuals: A charming controversy to say the least. The base for the original game was made during a competition where they were ALL challenged to use this one sprite set. Since the games from this competition have surfaced, the comment sections below any other game made in it will surely be discussing it. The sprite set wasn't bad either. The game utilizes a 2.5 top-down view with pop-out walls. Confused? Well, trust me it works very well for the style. It add's depth to a view that is otherwise flat, allowing for the distinction of space very well. This pixelated style is the same for everything but the menus and text, which is an interesting contrast. Leveling up, Heals, Mana Heals, Damage Taken, Class Quests and Character Unlocks quickly display over your character quickly and small enough to not be too intrusive, and come with a cool visual to catch your eye. ( ;) You'll see it.) 9/10  Music: There is only one music track, which despite being catchy, doesn't really either capture a mood or depict an atmosphere; it is just catchy and upbeat. There could've been more work within the music before Kabam had come along, but it was never done. After a while of playing this, you'll have your own playlist. However the sound effects are most important. Weapon sounds aren't memorable or intrusive, but you only hear your own. The enemy sounds are nice, since your focus is hurting the enemies, each enemy has a sound for when it is hit, along with you. Don't mute any sounds effects. Often through packed dungeons or the mysterious fame trains, you need some kind of confirmaton that you've hit something, there's an item drop, or you are hit yourself. Since you only hear sounds relevant to you, listening to the game's sounds will alert you to important events throughout the chaos happening on your screen, allowing you to pay attention to the visually subtle. 8/10  Overall Gameplay:  i. Design: For a bullet hell shooter, not being able to see your hitbox sucks. It pretty much is your whole character, which makes things a little harder and frustating. But aside from that, hhis is easily one of the most addicting, well-made-easy-to-access MMO's out there. Most of the time you aren't alone, and except for select dungeons, you can always teleport to someone else and fight monsters with them. This is the basis of 'fame trains'. However, be warned. The difficulty spikes in the ascent from level 10 to 20. You often ventured off on your own in a new environment with less than adequate armor amidst swarming enemies just for what previously seemed to be an innocent quest. This is the toughest part (except for select dungeons again) of the game to try to pass when not teleporting or joining fame trains to quickly boost up one's stats. You will lose characters a lot this way so be cautious and make sure to pay attention to what monsters are worth staying around to fight and which one's you should just run from. The unfiltered pixelated violence is very refreshing throughout, and it never seems too complicated, but it throws enough curveballs when regarding certain tiers of equipment one should use. The classes are... somewhat balanced, but Wizards, Knights, Priests, and perhaps Warriors and Paladins are the top priorities and are the most useful, especially lategame, which should be expected. These classes provide the typical Nuke, Stun, and Heal skills which are often most important in other RPG's and MOBA's. There is an absolutely amazing and thriving trade system, it feels completely like a real underground market, with its currency in 'stat pots' (hehe... pot). ROTMG somehow keeps one painfully coming back for more though, which is surprising for all the RQ'ing that it has caused over the years. 4/5  ii. Controls: The downsides in design are compensated by the majorly well-made controls. Advanced players can enjoy camera rotation for easy dodging and toggling of the center of the camera. Each inventory spot has a mapped hotkey. and the defaults simplicity work very well. Most importantly, they are crisp. It may be harder to keep up with even your movement due to the speed, but it is necessary. 5/5  iii. Content: Great variety in classes and enemies, and the dungeons spawn from enemy death, so they are currently well placed. There were a lot of popular fan-made dungeons though that were great ideas and were never implemented. This broke our hearts many times while checking updates. It all isn't hard to memorize, and doesn't have much flair again during levels 10-20. 4/5  iv. Enjoyabilitynessity: To sum it up, I go back to it periodically even when I'm not in a craze about it. It leaves an imprint, unforgettable like a small tattoo of a heart that you look at every once in a while and remember fond memories. 4/5  Overall Score: 84/100  BUT WAIT!  We haven't addressed the elephant in the room! Kabam. Screw Kabam. I've been reviewing pre-Kabam ROTMG. With Kabam's meddling added to the mix...  Kabam Overall Score: 72/100  A whole letter grade. I'll now explain why.  Story: The dialogue within new content isn't anything too good, plus on their way through remaking ROTMG they got rid of the main source of fanlore. Otherwise same. 7/10  Visuals: Nothing. No real improvements, but the style of the art was pretty steadfast since the beginning. 9/10  Music: Same. 8/10  Overall Gameplay:  i. Design: Endgame is accessible by paying and the market was debilitated. New people with money but no practice buy the loot, rush into endgame content, die, lose gear, blame perma-death and occasionally Kabam, then leave forever. GG. Pet system is OP, distracting and P2W. 1/5  ii. Controls: The only new thing is that the pets follow you like Half-Life NPC's. Sadly not enough of an issue to lose a point. 5/5  iii. Content: Only thing they improved. Content has been pumping out compared to before. New class, many new dungeons (lvls 10-20 are still in horrible shape) the pet system, backpack, more skins and 'boosts'. 5/5  iv. Enjoyabilitynessity: No more integrity within being able to reach the endgame, the 'bundles' from them are constantly shoved in your face, and anyone who played the old game just feels dirty playing the new one. You can play with hacks on the official server just by visiting another webpage. It leaves a bad aftertaste, without its usual addictiveness. 1/5  So... yuck. I only recommend the private servers, and they have spotty service, which is saddening.

8737	0	a	Read the reviews out of boredom, as I hadn't played this game in a while. Sadly, they're all true. Before Kabam, 10/10. Now, barely even a 3/10. In my opinion, not even worth the 38mb of space it takes up on your computer.
8738	0	a	Pay to win. Laggy, anti fun farming simulator, archer sucks without dbow wizards broken as ♥♥♥♥ and all the other classes suck except for warriors their broken as ♥♥♥♥. Also ♥♥♥♥ drake baker, 0/10 ♥♥♥♥ my ♥♥♥
8739	0	a	It's pretty fun at first, killing enemies to get better gear to raise your star color. But at a certain point it becomes nearly impossible for skilled players to gain access to better gear. The enemies you face to get this new gear are astronomically tough. This leaves only one option - pay for the gear. Although Kabam may have saved this game from dying, they have changed it into this pay to win system that prevents any skill to get you anywhere.   If you want a game to play for a few hours, it's fun if you like grinding for hours. However, if you don't plan to spend money while still getting good gear, don't get your hopes up
8740	0	a	I'll start off by saying, this is a fun game. But there are plenty of issues with it.   First off, it's a 2D RPG/Roguelike/Bullet hell game. This is actually a really good combination, the combat is fun and very simple whilst still having a fair amount of depth to it. The everlooming threat of permanent death keeps the game adrenaline filled even when you're fighting a boss you've fought hundreds of times before. The classes are unique and fun to play, each having their own niche. You can deal incredible amounts of damage very quickly with wizards, heal your teammates with priests, or stun monsters and tank with the knight. Or you can rush dungeons with rogues. Or take event bosses with an Assassin. Or clear dungeons with an Archer. For every playstyle, there is a class.  The economy in this game is based off of stat potions. These increase your stats permanently, and are always in demand due to perma death. The least rare and thus least valuable potion is the speed potion, with the holy grail of pots being the life potion. Trading with other players is a fun process, albeit long. Unlike other economies in other games the currency in this game is always being destroyed so it retains it's value instead of constantly being inflated. This makes each boss fight that much more intense knowing that even though the risk is high, the reward is much, much higher.   However the bad in this game is Kabum. The developers of this game have constantly shown they don't understand what the player actually wants. I've stopped playing this game simply because Kabum is terrible. Things they have done include accidentally releasing a warrior kit bundle for 1 gold (premium in game currency worth roughly 1 cent). This instantly tanked the price of the kit and screwed up the economy for a bit. Another thing they did to mess up the game royally was removing the ability of gland mobs to drop pots. This made the price of stat pots rise until they reverted back to the original model. Again, screwing up the economy for a bit.    Altogether a good game ruined by a bad developer.
8741	0	a	This game was great and full of potential, until kabam bought it...
8742	0	a	This game is not recomeneded for players who are not aquainted with MMOo's. I for one started playing this a while ago and found myself in need of creating hundreds of characters simply because i could not find a good quest. I am sure if you enjoy playing games of this genera it can be quite well made made. But I can not recomend it for the majority of people. Im sorry
8743	0	a	Boring grindfest, awful payment model.
8744	0	a	Pay-to-win in a really ugly way. Not only can you buy items, you won't even have enough vault space to store most of the loot you find unless you pay for it.  It's especially frustrating in the beginning when you have to play every starter class to unlock new ones, but you can't possibly store gear for more than 2 classes at a time unless you only save partial sets. That means you have to throw away lots of good class specific gear and later you'll be ♥♥♥♥♥♥ because you need to find those specific items again.  Or you can just pay more and more and more and all the limitations will go away.
8745	0	a	WAS good, got restructured, enjoy throwing money at your screen!
8746	0	a	Bad game. You can trust me. My play time is high
8747	0	a	this game is great until u die...
8748	0	a	Pay2Win piece of ♥♥♥♥. it used to be good now kablam took over and its terrible
8749	0	a	Man was this game good before pay to win. Now it sucks. End of story, move on folks.
8750	0	a	So after a few hours of trying the game i find it not bad.... But thanks to KABAM taking away gold spawns and forcing us to buy it, meh....  5/10
8751	0	a	This game used to be fun, but then a greedy company baught it up, ruining the fun and making it pay to win. You're 2 years too late to get this game, It's utterly ruined now.
8752	0	a	This isent a review but more of a rip to my 6/8. So if you played this game and have done a abbiss of demons then you know that the lava dissapears where the bag is droped form the boss but the lava dident go away and i died because i got a white bag and started freaking out not thinking about lava that should have dissapeared. rate 5:10 if they do nothing about this rate 10:10 if they do something if you know where I can email thim about this I would be happy to know.
8753	0	a	heavy P2W - need i say more
8754	0	a	Kabam destroyed this game.
8755	0	a	Pay to win game. Everything else is irrelevant, pay to win will ruin any game regardless of its gameplay.
8756	0	a	As everyone said this game is pay to win.   Other than that it is a fun mmoprg with a fun retro 2-D look. The part that pisses me off the most is dying and losing all your hard earned items and exp. I guess that is what makes the game challenging and addicting for some people.  The whole game is a giant mindless grind-fest like every other mmorpg. It was fun for the first few times playing it, but it gets dull real fast.   tip: archer is op
8757	0	a	Kinda nice Game but it gets really boring after a while.
8758	0	a	I used to play this game alot back a few years in the browser version, and it was great.. but since Kabam bought it it's basically imposible to play without paying.  Thank you Kabam.
8759	0	a	The game itself isn't bad at all, but the in-game purchases make it terrible. First of all, there is no warning that you lose the backpack item or clothing dye items when you die. I purchased a backpack, died within 5 minutes, and it was gone. Great. There needs to be a warning, especially since these items require gold, which can ONLY be bought with real money. What kind of freakin scam is this??
8760	0	a	Graphics are 8-bit, thats just being lazy IMO.
8761	0	a	its ♥♥♥♥
8762	0	a	This game is nothing but a pay to win.. It was ruined when Kabam took over and isn't worth your time... A litteral f2p that I still haven't gotten my moneys worth out of..
8763	0	a	Not recommended my friends play this game and my computer is a potato so I cannot play with them~Matt
8764	0	a	Getting epic stuns with 6/8 knight on O2, misses a stun on Sphinx, gets instakilled, cried for 3 hours.  1/&lt;/3 too much yolo
8765	0	a	For Two reasons 1 When you die you 'Die' Your player is deleted and you need to make a new one 2: Beacuse Kabam made If you spend 10$ on One Player Then he dies All that money went to waste So Its also a money scam
8766	0	a	This game wa pretty fun back then. Wild Shadow Studios did an amasing job making and creating the game. Years before Kabam had to come in and take the whole operation. Kabam needs to be set aflame for what they have done to the best bullet hell game I know. If they change what they did to the game then I might proobably come back to it. But I am pretty certain that it will never happen in a life-time.  Rest in Peace ROTMG ~Twas once a fenomenal game until Kabam shot an arrow through it's knee
8767	0	a	Kabam killed it, all that needs to be said.
8768	0	a	The reason why I choose not to recommend this game when having played it for such a vast amount of time is because its a drug. Before the in pay-to-win in game transactions invaded the in game economy the play was fun, addicting and sometimes heart wrenching. However, most of the in game community was rude, arrogant and manipulative, which was relatively redemable from the mix of a complex and enjoyable mix of a slower-paced, trade based system that relied on a fast based action. It was fun, but the concept behind it feels evil, and not the enjoyable rpg style evil.   The game itself is a trap, if it wasnt before it is now. Before it was a viscious cycle disguised with a fun art style and simple, entertaining gameplay (challenging none the less) that will entice you to play more and more until you're like me and youve played hundreds of hours, and that was before the pay to win. Now its a trap to steal your time, and your money by frustrating you into buying in game items (along with ruining the economy, one of the most redeeming aspects in the process).  In short, I would stay as far away from this game as possible. It is a hard drug, the PC equivolent of crack cocaine. There is nothing else to say about it. It is not a 'bad game' in terms of concept or gameplay, its just not worth it by any means. Go play Isaac instead.
8769	0	a	This is not a review, just a commentary from a 3-year player of this game (I don't play it on steam).  Like many, I once really enjoyed this game for its permadeath, variety, grindiness, and above all the friends that it connected me to. It was always the people that made realm; many continue to return for this reason, including myself.  I always found niches in the game that were fun for me. A lot has changed over the past two years, though, some of which has admittedly been good. The largest and most controversial of them, however, have very much  trivialized the game . I still find fun dodging death, playing on unmaxed characters in areas not being roflstomped by the ubiquity of OPness now in the game. I do not take the game seriously, any more. Sadly, It is not remotely what it once was. :'(   I still drop in to say hello, to get my dodge on, maybe to help some new players, but I ignore my main and his maxed chars. I'd rather dodge petless with t6s.
8770	0	a	all you do is walk around with nothing to do
8771	0	a	My friend and I tried this game last night. Never have we been so disappointed with a game. No party system. Missing most things a game needs to be fun.
8772	0	a	all of the graphics are from a way better game called legends of yore if you want some real fun play legends of yore instead of this pile of crap
8773	0	a	You would have a beter time stabing yourself then this game
8774	0	a	Worst 8-bit game I have ever played, please don't waste your time on even trying this game... Boring Lose all of your items on death Need friends to play with if you even wan't to even have a little fun, so many more games out there that are much better and are free.
8775	0	a	Unfair 8-bit, permadeath, bullet-hell of addictive proportions. Don't even try to start this. It'll have you paying money before you know it on a character and unfairly killing it off to make you start over.
8776	0	a	It is a fun game and all, but there is too much you need to purchase with real money that it feels like a crummy iPhone game with in-app purchases. It would be alright if we could somehow get gold ingame by doing things, such as defeating a boss or doing some quests. If you don't purchase gold with your credit card, this game is not fun.
8777	0	a	I used to play this game all the time. I loved it to death. I unlocked all the classes, founded a guild, the whole box and dice. But then I stopped. I couldn't remember why, until I redownloaded after a bit of craving for dungeon crawling. Now I remember why. Kabam.  Before Kabam came into the picture, Wild Shadow Studios did a great job. The ingame shops weren't anything intrusive, you were never pressured into buying things, you just bought the occasional pet and went off to get your ♥♥♥ kicked again.  But then Kabam bought Wild Shadow, and they saw $$$$. They said 'Why not put all the top tier items up for sale in a game with permadeath, and make em pay a bajillion dollars?!' This, among other things, such as the skins, the constant annoying remeinders, these made me stop playing. There still is a good game under all this, but it's just not enjoyable because of all the pay2win ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. This USED to be on TF2's level, but now it's barely above FarmVille.  7.8/10 too much P2W-IGN
8778	0	a	I WANT THE OLD ONE BACK!!!
8779	0	a	Gets boring after a few hundred hours. dont play.
8780	0	a	This game...ruined by kabam. This game also ruined my life
8781	0	a	Note- i play on the website, so thats why i only have 10 min   No... just NO.- my reaction to Kabam taking over. Its not as much as the fact that they added tops to the nexus. No, its the fact that THEY MAKE IT THE EASIEST WAY TO GET THEM. Your other options are killing the mad god HIMSELF or buying it, the first of which takes tremendous skill and computer power and the other taking SO VERY LONG. Before who cared if they had tops? It was fun to simply play with what you had. Then also, the scammers. People are such aholes that they will STEAL YOU ITEMS FROM YOU and sometimes SELL IT FOR REAL MONEY!!! Know what thats called? The flipping black market. The flipping black market is in this game. This is all not to mention the OUTRAGEOUS amount of crashes and lag deaths that is caused by this game. Its perma death, and you didnt just die from stupidity. No, you died because of something YOU DO NOT CONTROL. And guess what? Kabam wont revive your character. They refuse to revive something that died because of total accident on your computers and partly their fault. This review would be ten times longer IF I HAD THE TIME TO WRITE IT. Not only this, but it also seems that PEOPLE CAN HACK YOUR ACCOUNT. A famous youtuber on the game named TEEBQNE was hacked by a keylogger. Most of his characters that he had WHERE KILLED. Most of which had BACKPACKS ON THEM AND OTHER THINGS BOUGHT WITH MONEY!!! And what did Kabam do? They didnt do sh%$. They just sat by and waited until THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY MADE THEM. THIS SH%$ IS WHAT MADE ME QUIT THIS GAME, AND NOW IT LAYES IN SOME FORGOTTEN PLACE ON MY TOOLBAR, UNTOUCHED FOR MONTHS. THIS GAME HAS GONE TO SH%$ KABAM, AND YOU ARE TO BLAME. I DO NOT RECCOMENT PLAYING THIS DECEASED GAME, FOR BEFORE KABAM TOOK OVER I RATED 9/10; I NOW RATE IT 0/10
8782	0	a	Could be great - but the decision for this business model kills it.
8783	0	a	Kabam killed this game harder then a green potion and my knight #InsideJokes
8784	0	a	It was fun but when you die, BOOM! you lose tonnes of hard earned sweat draining from the sink that just makes you fill it up again just for it to drain it out again. But for a pass time game or a game for trolling or annoying people it's ok. But! if you want a really good game, check out the paid games, they're usually better xD
8785	0	a	Basically this game in a nutshell. Farm(gear). Die(lose all your gear). Repeat.
8786	0	a	my 2.2 hours were spent on a loading screen plus everyone can tell that its another ♥♥♥♥ f2p that thrives on MC
8787	0	a	It was all fun and games untill Kabams microtransactions came to play.
8788	0	a	LET ME REWORK THIS ♥♥♥♥♥♥ GAME! According to people a company named Kabam made this cute fun game, INTO THE BIGGEST PAY TO WIN ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ EVER CREATED! I swear the duck update on TF2 was less of a P2W experiance. ♥♥♥♥S SAKE. ♥♥♥♥ you Kabam. This game was AMAZING. And then you came along and made EVERYTHING PAY PAY PAY PAY!!!! YOU GREEDY ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥S! 0/10 ♥♥♥♥ing Money Grind by ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥
8789	0	a	This game is pretty much the same as it was when I played it over a year ago in terms of mechanics, but the downside is that it seems to have been bought out by a larger company, with a a very intense focus of making money off of its players. It's pretty much a pay to win game, and if you die, it's permadeath, and you lose any money you may have spent on your character. Not only that, but the main world chat is completely un-readable due to the hundreds of bots that are spamming websites selling gold on this game, since that also seems to be completely unregulated. It was a nice idea, and a decent game at first, and you're welcome to give it a shot (hey, it's free), but I wouldn't recommend it.
8790	0	a	Used to be a great game, until the Kaban nation arrived.
8791	0	a	The game doesnt allow me to see all of the screen. I cant leave the page after death becasue i cant see the exit. The game is alot better on web browsers than on Steam.
8792	0	a	no longer free to play. When it first game to Steam I loved this game, it was really exciting and loved playing with the random people.
8793	0	a	GG kabam, ruined another one.
8794	0	a	i have never played this game, so i don't why steam is letting me write this review.  0/10 people say it's ruined
8795	0	a	Give me back my archer ~ YouNipple
8796	0	a	S*H*I*T
8797	0	a	This game seems intent on not letting me play. There is no play button to actually start the game.
8798	0	a	Haven't played the game in a while, but I heard some greedy ♥♥♥ company bought it and made it PAY to PLAY. Can you imagine that! THATS WORSE THAN PAY TO WIN!  -30 light years/100
8799	0	a	Broken, can't sign up, can't log in, can't do anything. Wants money via gold.
8800	0	a	Probobly one of the worst games i have EVER played. Dont do it.  REASONS  -Full of hackers -Kabam -Pay to win type thing
8801	0	a	Laggy thru Steam apparently so i went to play thru firefox and everything is locked unless u give them ur monies. Could only pick the wizzard. Sigh, i read alot of the reviews most people say its Pay to win and even with my limited experience i cuncur
8802	0	a	Realm of the mad microtransaction.
8803	0	a	Was originally a good game before it was bought out my Kablam. Now it is a Pay 2 Win piece of ♥♥♥♥. Absolutely zero skill required to get the highest teir of gear anymore, as you can just buy it with their premium currency.
8804	0	a	Kabam... That is all.
8805	0	a	Its a pay to win game if you dont put money into the game youll end up with BAD ingame item drops. this is just my opinion,
8806	0	a	I used to play this game and im going to continue playing it again, it is such a good game. Best part being that you can't get too over powered!  Which is what i used to say, it got incredibly dull and boring after a great period of time. I will always recommend some dota 2 rather than this. It is so repetitive that you'll be restarting faster than you change underwear,unless you don't(weirdo),which should be pretty fast. It is frustrating to see people off with their amazing gear, which most have bought, and take down that enemy instantly. Notifier doesn't help either. Overall this game is O.K. but if you really want a game to spend a large portion of your day, then go try some dota 2 or csgo.
8807	0	a	Amazing Game! It's an mmo with levels, but you level super fast; if you die... it's game over...  Well that was what I had said back when the game wasn't 100% terrible... do not play it, it is run by a money hungry company. They went so far to scam new players with their package that game nothing useful at all besides the backpacks and the super low chance of getting a decent pet. Speaking of pets, well I used to not like how amulets seperated the pros from the noobs. Now thanks to  Ka-pay2win-bam, pets are like amulets except a lot stronger and not to mention they seperate the noobs with the richest people in the game, and the richest people in the game to the people who have spent THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS TO GET THEIR PET UP 3 OR 4 LEVELS... WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥ KABAM.
8808	0	a	DONT GET WARNING WARNING THE CHATS AI N PEOPLE DONT HELP WHEN U ASK CASUE THERE AI N IF U DO COME ACROSS SOMBODY N TRY TRADE THEY ♥♥♥♥ING SCAM U IF UR A NOOB
8809	0	a	So i started to play just fine and it was fun and then three minutes later when i died and tried to make a new character it didnt say play...so i could'nt even play the game...ye ;-;
8810	0	a	Used to be good, now just a pay to win
8811	0	a	i can't go to the game
8812	0	a	(Don't get fooled by low playtime, I've played the game a lot when it was on Kongregate)  Avoid this game, it doesn't deserve your time, money or even attention...  It's just a grindfest, with lazy graphics (I do enjoy miself some nice pixel art, but this is just awful), total absense of mechanics or any sort of gameplay beyond clicking your left mouse button, overpriced ♥♥♥♥, and the whole concept of the game is: see who can grind the most, untill they die by grinding too much, or you can ease the grinding by paying...  Just get a job, it'll be as fun as this waste is and it'll net you some income instead of asking for your money at every turn (I also understand that a free game needs a way to earn money and sustain the developers, but here it just get's crazy)
8813	0	a	This game is a stole,you buy items and you die,you lost money .... but is very good for play ... but terrible to buy ....
8814	0	a	This has become a horrible pay to win, all because a company named Kabam, CURSE YOU KABAM!
8815	0	a	It's an okay free to play game bu some better ones are: TF2, Toribash, Robocraft, Floating Point, and Super Crate Box.
8816	0	a	♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ly addictive
8817	0	a	this game is a waste of money and crap
8818	0	a	After several attempts to try to play this game I ended up throwing my computer out the window from the sheer retardation this game put me through. ♥♥♥♥ this game.
8819	0	a	I played this game for close to year and it was a masterpiece , it was very rewarding and unique , once Kabam took over and introduced pets the game went downhill. It made a ton easier and a pay 2 win , its a shame , I probably would still be playing now if it wasn't for kabam. I wouldn't recommend getting into this game the community isn't near what is used to be and all the legends have quit. RIP rotmg.
8820	0	a	perma-death extremely anoying
8821	0	a	Free, so why not? I didn't like it all that much.
8822	0	a	Way to many in game purchases
8823	0	a	Never judge a book by its cover. Thought this game would be a fun 'Free To Play' game with a few micro-transactions, as is the norm these days. But holy crap.  The currency in the game (gold) can ONLY be earned by paying real money. Otherwise you have to grind for hours to get anything decent.   Screw Kabam. Thats basically what every review will say.
8824	0	a	I dont know how to start this considering its not the best  The game is 'freemium' meaning you buy everything with real money (pretty much)  Controls are really laggy, it takes forever to register my movements (moving forward when i pressed forward 5 seconds ago)  I wouldn't reccomend this game because it has gone way down hill.
8825	0	a	KABAM THIS GAME IS GOING... GOING... GONE  At least teh Un-instal still works
8826	0	a	this game is gay
8827	0	a	This game was spoiled by too many hackers
8828	0	a	It feels almost like one of those 'video games,' only without fun.
8829	0	a	Meh, the free part is missleading, you cant do much without buying the package thing.
8830	0	a	Thought this might be fun...
8831	0	a	Freemium cancer. Avoid.
8832	0	a	LAME! I tried playing it but it was so boring I stopped. Absolutely, Positively, Horrible.
8833	0	a	Update: Changing my review to negative because of how the company treats the game. They are very disconnected on how the game works and they dont bother updating the game at all. The rare event is just to squeeze more money out of the slowly dieing population that they have left. Also I hate F2P games that try to trick people into gambling real money with mind tricks that its a good deal. Kabam sucks at game development and should just give up with there other ♥♥♥♥ titles as well. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Its a good hard game if you dont care about graphics and like the old school Galaga type games with a RPG class twist.  While it does have a cash shop where you can buy equipment for real money, you can easily earn it ingame when you become good. If youre not at that level then you will just lose it when you die which also btw, is really over priced (I doubt anyone buys them). The only real P2W thing about this game is the pet system at a very late level that you may never expierence anyway.  So anyway, you go reach level 20. Do dungeon runs to get all your stats maxed with stat pots. Get good gear. Try to reach 5 star fame by getting 2k 'exp'. Die, repeat. Try harder dungeons. Repeat. A bit sandboxy I guess.
8834	0	a	Used to be great, now Kabam got hold of it and I have never been able to play it since, due to bugs not letting me log in.  So what I'm saying is, Realm of the Mad God is amazing but the customer support is non existent, and apparently people have issues left and right that will probably never be solved.
8835	0	a	It appears to be just another dumb Pay to Win game. Don't bother, it's just not fun when you're constantly being persuaded to purchase something that won't even last long at all. The reason I have no hours on this is because I left as soon as I saw the option of In-Game Purchases.
8836	0	a	To me is out for your hard earned money. While I enjoy the game, those microtransactions leave a bad taste.
8837	0	a	Used to play this when it wasn't a shop.  Now I can't even log in - doesn't respond and half of it doesn't even work.  Avoid.
8838	0	a	this game is horible full stop
8839	0	a	when i die i hate it. i dont know what to press so i just exit the game. make it that R goes back to Nexus
8840	0	a	0/5 stars I give this game is not even worth a penny. This is a freemium pay to win game where if you die you loose everything on you. If you buy a good weapon with real money then die it's gone. If that's not bad enough the gold spammers are worse in this game than any other No matter how many times you block them they just keep changing their names and keep spamming. There is not even an option to report them. I would not recommend this game to anyone.
8841	0	a	The Game has too much focus on Graphics rather than game play.
8842	0	a	0/100000000000 cant play with out buying coins 
8843	0	a	I feel like this would be an amusing game if, instead, you could just buy the game on the cheap and never be required to use a cash shop.
8844	0	a	size so small even my ants cannot have kids in there
8845	0	a	Tried to play this, didn't have much luck. The concept is good, but right now it's too buggy to be playable. I encountered multiple instances of bugs requiring exit and restart of the client within the first 30 minutes.
8846	0	a	This game is funny when you start it but you will soon realise that two choices comes : you can pay it and don't loose too much or don't pay it and you will loose all and realise that it will be really long to be a good player in this game.
8847	0	a	Resolution is fixed now.The only annyoing thing now that the devs have to update is the controls.If you controls your character he often goes to far.
8848	0	a	Fun, but ingame cash is almost required, which makes it long and boring
8849	0	a	teleport to higher level players to level up: the game.
8850	0	a	Archaic (retro 8 bit) Graphics, Arcade (i.e. Bullet Hell) gameplay mechanics, constantly having to quit/re-open the game because one of the (MANY!!) In Game Purchase prompts doesn't properly display within the window so that all the UI elements I need to CLOSE it (instead of 'Buy', which IS visible) are off screen and I can't reach them ...   What's to like? (AVOID - It was awful!)  Review: 1/5 Stars  (It gets 1 Star because it was FREE, hence my expectations were lower.)
8851	0	a	This game has serious potential, and a great in game economy. That is if you can get past the ♥♥♥♥ development and Moderation status of the game. Not to mention the game is 100% pay to win. Microtransactions literally crawling up every oraphus.  ++I like the game and all the ideas++ -- The people who run the game now are ♥♥♥♥-- 
8852	0	a	This game is so bad i don't even know how to start the game... there will be a play button and when you click it you have to choose a class. I want to be the wizard but theres no back button or select button... very disaponting
8853	0	a	I could stomach all the pay to win, but if you make it so better players like me can't trade UT?  Thats just idiotic.
8854	0	a	It would be better if it actually worked right.
8855	0	a	I cant do anything in the game because of this stupid beginners package that keeps on popping up and it is half off screen and I cant click anything
8856	0	a	This game is a stole,you buy items and you die,you lost money .... but is very good for play ... but terrible to buy ....
8857	0	a	Honestly, Its a fine game, but I'm someone who isn't that good with money, and if you don't like spending money, than I would reccomend against buying this game. Seriously, If you dont buy somthing atleast once than it's gonna be extremely hard to get good items in the game.
8858	0	a	Look at my play time. Look deep into it. Look at how short my play time is. That is how unbearable this game is.  [The start] I boot up the game, I read a few revies but thought that maybe they were overexaggerating, the first thing i see is half the page dedicated DIRECTLY TO SELLING YOU ITEMS I ignore this and create my character. I encounter the first mini boss in the tutorial, it took way too long due to the CRIPPLING MOVEMENT LAG. That is right. Most of my play time was from waiting for my character to stop flailing his ♥♥♥ around so i could attempt to hit an enemy, even then it shot everywhere but where i aimed! I went to the nexus to attempt to g- OH DEAR OG THE FRICKIN BOTS you have no idea the chat was covering 1/3 of my screen because of the bot spam. I exited the game and i am going to uninstall it. It's a waste of good data space.
8859	0	a	the servers are soooo laggy if you hold on to a move key for to long it will stay going that direction for a long time before you can gain controll of it. and the game has no storyline and people who just barely start playing have no clue what to do or how to do it
8860	0	a	this game use to be fun, now not so much because the new developers made it into a shameless pay-to-win
8861	0	a	Awesom and very addictive co-op game i enjoy playing with my friends but its more to pay to win so  Recommended if ur rich and want to spend ur cash in game
8862	0	a	I have to unlock priest class to get an achievment, the bad thing is that i had priest when i started the game...
8863	0	a	Fun until you realize the pay to play aspect. Used to be really fun...
8864	0	a	There is no reason to ever try this. You'd go mad at the combat system.  Honestly its one of those games you will either hate.. or dislike in a very.. friendly way. You cannot like it, Sorry.
8865	0	a	This was a great game, it's a shame kabam made it paid 2 win.
8866	0	a	Everything about this game is horrible, yet I still play it.
8867	0	a	You need Java to run this. There's been a lot of issues with Java and hackers lately. I wouldn't want anyone downloading this and open up any security holes on their system.
8868	0	a	♥♥♥♥ this game
8869	0	a	Sadly a pay to win game
8870	0	a	THIS IS A POORLY ♥♥♥♥ING MADE GAME
8871	0	a	People who have bad eyes and cant stand pixels Dont play this!
8872	0	a	nope. pay to win kabam ruined the game and make it pay 2 win
8873	0	a	really kabam? YOU RUIND THE GAME
8874	0	a	aftr laoding 2 100%........................................the game dsn't starts
8875	0	a	never buy stuff in this game for real money  is pay2win game  but its roguelike, so if you die its permadeath and all your items/money spent is lost  so therefore only play free and dying isnt so bad, you can just start over  but to get any real strong you must pay, this game is broken since kabam took over
8876	0	a	I really hate this gme. It is very buggy and just all around bad. I will never play this game again.
8877	0	a	Dont get me wrong i enjoyed it a fair bit BUUT there are WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYY too many spammers in the market trying to pawn off they're real life market stuff.. really annoyed the hell out of me..
8878	0	a	I have never seen more pay to win features. It doesn't even look fun.
8879	0	a	If you find it fun to have to grind for hours to get your stuff back after you die the this game is fot you. If not it's okay, just spend 15$ and you get most of your stuff back.
8880	0	a	this game is sooooooo stupid!
8881	0	a	These changes are terrible. Money money money .... I hate this pay to win i remember the good old days of Realm.. And when this update hit it started lagging hard now my binding of isaac lags also (flash games) And yeah i have a great pc run titanfall on max no problem but this lags no way :P R.I.P Realm
8882	0	a	Was very fun in the beginning but just got so repetative and mindless whatever class you chose you had to do the exact same thing over and over.
8883	0	a	Terrible. The micro transactions are the worse I've ever seen.
8884	0	a	Freemium cancer. Avoid.
8885	0	a	HORRIBLE! IT WON'T LET ME SIgn IN! It says this PUT YOUR EMAIL AND PASSWORD SO I DID! IT WON'T TELL ME IF I AM WRONG OR CORRECT! SRLYS SOME PLEASE HELP!

8887	0	a	:( 
8888	0	a	ITS A ♥♥♥♥ING PAY 2 WIN :|
8889	0	a	if this game got any better i still wouldnt play it because ive seen a 13 year old code a game better and actually have a purpose to it
8890	0	a	I find that the game is a bit glitchy on my Ubuntu system. I run it using a PlayOnLinux setup. Sometimes my character just suddenly decides to go into the wilderness and stop in a swarm of snakes. This being said, of course, this is Wine running, and so things are bound to not be as good as native Windows. I'd like this to be ported to Linux.
8891	0	a	well when u die u shoudlent loose the whole game u should loose some gold
8892	0	a	 Huge technical issues
8893	0	a	For me the game is not worth the effort, there is alot of better free to play games out there. I tried to have fun with it but no. Repeative and boring. And sadly PAY to WIN. No thanx!!!..  Do i recommend it NO!  GFx 1-10 SFx 3-10 Gameplay 4-10
8894	0	a	This game is pretty 'okay'. It runs on flash which means that it never runs lag-free. (Part of it is, it being a bullethell-MMO) Even though the developers try to keep the game up to date, it rarely feels like they are really adding *new* and *exiciting* stuff. Most of the content that was added recently, had already existed before Kabam was in control. It is pretty frustrating that the only *new* equipment, they add are either complete crap or a reskin of an already existing item. About 3 months ago, I stopped playing this game since I already have achieved most of the stuff I can achieve and new content is either really boring or not important because it doesn't drop important stuff. Also RNG is a pretty HUGE factor here which doesn't make the game as fun, when your friends have 300 hours less and just get an item you have been searching for 300 hours.  I am still *recommending* this game because it is pretty fun as long as you have new content which you always have when just starting the game. After achieving everything, the game is not really fun to play. The perma-death aspect of the game is interesting but can be REALLY frustrating due dying because of lag isn't that rare. (No refund btw)  GL HF anyway guys.
8895	0	a	it is not very fun
8896	0	a	You die and lose All of your itens? :(
8897	0	a	kinda nice, but it sucks because if you need put items and you have no place you gotto buy realm gold. and ut is not avaible to trade anymore. and if you die you wont be able to get those items you had back. well... rotmg was better when there was regular ammys... i dont really like this game anymore... ...
8898	0	a	Weak Servers and pay to win. dont waste the time.
8899	0	a	Game did not even properly function. I couldn't even select a class.
8900	0	a	Gameplay too glitchy, and the aim control is too hard  5 / 10
8901	0	a	I bought this game despite the bad reviews because I liked the retro style. I enjoyed the game but still found the ads kinda annoying. their was one time when an ad appeared so far to the left of the screen I wasn't able to click the cross button (tricky jerks). I enjoy the game but don't recommend it, because the only way to earn gold is TO BUY IT WITH REAL MONEY. That's a sliiiiiiiight disappointment considered YOU CAN BARELY DO ANYTHING WITHOUT GOLD. 4/10
8902	0	a	this game was fun i played it with my friend,we played and played.........until he got scrade by boss that had so many minions that helped the boss so he got scared and ran away so i was alone fighting the boss,i was only level 7 and wasent that powerful so i died,then i thinked its like a game that i played monts ago,and there was that thing that if u die u will have your character with its items but in this game u die and u will lose your charater and your items (i had some pretty good armors) and if you have great items (lgendary) then you can get sad sometimes,you should try this game if you have a group of friends that can help you if you are in danger but i was playing with only 1 of my friends so it wasnt that easy :( 
8903	0	a	Very,very pay to win game,used to be so fun raiding bosses with large groups but now if you dont pay at least 5$ youre screwed and will most likely die on lvl 10 if youre lucky.
8904	0	a	great game fundamentally and was basically perfect up until the oint when it was purchased by another company... The game is now pay to win, easy to hack and has a ♥♥♥♥ community. Thanks kabam!
8905	0	a	Like games with insane lag that makes them virtually unplayable? This game is for you.
8906	0	a	This game lags too much, becomes an issue when fighting tough enemies. Sometimes you can't nexus out in time. My game has been crashing mid-dungeon. Major issue.
8907	0	a	fun game, but not recommend it...you can try it anyway...
8908	0	a	Although this game is alright the lack of decent and minimum tier audio options puts me off too much to play it more than 10 minutes at a time.
8909	0	a	♥♥♥♥ this game and all its bull ♥♥♥♥ you lost me a character 
8910	0	a	Game is nice but i dont feel it really any special... and i must say that the repetitive music makes me sick just after playing for some time... sorry...
8911	0	a	This is the game you play when your stuck on a 4GB laptop with terrible graphics, and is 8 years old. Its only fun if you are really really bored and have nothing to do in the real world.
8912	0	a	gather round kiddes for i have a story there wonce was a game called realm of mad god a game where controls are shity and lag is plenty full and it would neverload moral dont waste time on this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t
8913	0	a	I HATE THIS SO MUCH! AND IT MEANS MUCH FOR SOMEONE THAT LIKE ALMOST ALL THE GAMES ON THE STEAM.... DON'T ASK.... AND I CAN WRITE TODAY JUST IN BIG LETTERS DON'T ASK......XDXDXDXDXD!
8914	0	a	The gameplay is repetetive and boring.
8915	0	a	Incredibly broken, I cant even get in the game anymore or make or delete characters, it was fun last time I played about a year ago but now it is absolute garbage
8916	0	a	This game sucks. It looks awful, uses very annoying free-to-play strategies (like posting sales that you have purchase to close), and is a general waste of time. I'm very disipointed in myself for paying any money on this game, and in you if you have also wasted any money on this game.
8917	0	a	Oh my gosh... This is literally the most frustrating game I have ever played. Perma-death blows.
8918	0	a	It's fun and addicting, but there are honestly some big downsides. -The community is for the most part awful. The people can be nice, but there are spambots everywhere. -If you don't like roguelikes, stay away. Permanent character death is a love-or-hate thing for most people. -The small inventory and vault space (unless you buy more with actual money) is extremely frustrating. -It feels very 'pay to win' with so many items being purchasable with actual money (see above). Still, if none of these things bother you, you should give it a try, as it is 'free' anyway. Overall, this game gets major nostalgia points from me, but I see a lot of reasons new players would want to stay away.
8919	0	a	-rep, destroyed my life.
8920	0	a	This game suck balls
8921	0	a	Pay-2-win, want a pet? Pay for it. Want some colours to distinguish yourself from everyone else? Pay for it. Just died and need some incentive to get you back into playing this game? Pay for it. I think you get the point ;)  Just look around, if bullet hell is what you're looking for, other games do it better and won't cost you nearly as much.
8922	0	a	Review on 9/8/12:  Really fun MMO, gotta try it.  Updated Review (as of 9/23/14, last truly played nearly a year before):  I can't say I can recommend this game any more. After Kabam took over, RotMG became a major cash grab that I would eventually stop playing. I haven't played a true session of RotMG in at least a year, and I do check on the game occasionally. However, each time I check the cash shop grows larger and larger.  Back when Wild Wolf Studios was developing the game, there was a cash shop, but it was nothing but a few dyes and clothes. It did sell weapons, but it was very selective and didn't contain every piece of in-game items. Now, the cash shop contains dyes, clothes, armor, weapons, rings, and nearly every other thing in the game. Hell, the Vault's became HUGE! When I was playing, the Vault was merely 10-20 chests, and they gave you one free. Now, there's at least 35 chests, but you still only get one. Who in their ♥♥♥♥ing MIND would actually spend that much money?  Which brings me to another issue. The cost of the cash shop. The prices are set so rediculously high, 5 bucks might buy you a little bit of clothes. Did I mention that anything you buy you'll lose on death? Yea, that's a thing. Better save up those $$$ for the Vault, huh?  I will be honest, though. The gameplay isn't entirely screwed up, but when I see everyone running around with clothes and dyes and end-game equipment all bought from the shop (I should also mention that the old shop never sold near end-game equipment), it feels like they haven't even tried to collect anything. Used to be, RotMG was a matter of finding what you could, and saving any really good stuff you find for a character you like in your Vault so on your next playthrough, you'd have a good start.  The game is also filled with spambots at the Nexus, but this isn't Kabam's fault, as they've been around since the game first popped up.  I'll end off on this note (also a TL;DR): RotMG isn't a bad game. At its core, the main gameplay is still there, and can still be pretty fun. However, it's plagued by a huge cash shop that a large amount of players use to be able to breeze through the game without ever actually trying. The game is also stuffed with spambots in the main hub of the game, the Nexus. Sadly, in RotMG's case, the bad outweighs the good, and I can't say to give this a try.
8923	0	a	I used to play this game almost 5 hours a day. Now it seems that all the creators want is money. Nearly everything in the shop cost Gold, which cost money. This is a great game, but I'd wish that the creators would give more options for the Free to Play people that will not spend money on a game (which is completely fine). This game is a pixel style MMO where you walk around a fight monsters, level up, unlock new classes, and do many, many things. If almost everything wouldn't cost money, I would still not play this game knowing the fact that it ha already been ruined. Rating: -69/10
8924	0	a	i can't go to the game
8925	0	a	this game is great until u die...
8926	0	a	Pay2Win piece of ♥♥♥♥. it used to be good now kablam took over and its terrible
8927	0	a	This game used to be fun, but then a greedy company baught it up, ruining the fun and making it pay to win. You're 2 years too late to get this game, It's utterly ruined now.
8928	0	a	Pay to win  100% ruined by Kabam  
8929	0	a	Ruined by Kabam.
8930	0	a	It's fun and addicting, but there are honestly some big downsides. -The community is for the most part awful. The people can be nice, but there are spambots everywhere. -If you don't like roguelikes, stay away. Permanent character death is a love-or-hate thing for most people. -The small inventory and vault space (unless you buy more with actual money) is extremely frustrating. -It feels very 'pay to win' with so many items being purchasable with actual money (see above). Still, if none of these things bother you, you should give it a try, as it is 'free' anyway. Overall, this game gets major nostalgia points from me, but I see a lot of reasons new players would want to stay away.
8931	0	a	2/10 good game absolute ♥♥♥♥ community
8932	0	a	this game ♥♥♥♥ing sucks
8933	0	a	Kabam ruined it Definitively pay 2 play
8934	0	a	Oh my gosh... This is literally the most frustrating game I have ever played. Perma-death blows.
8935	0	a	its okay i guess
8936	0	a	Like games with insane lag that makes them virtually unplayable? This game is for you.
8937	0	a	This game is pretty 'okay'. It runs on flash which means that it never runs lag-free. (Part of it is, it being a bullethell-MMO) Even though the developers try to keep the game up to date, it rarely feels like they are really adding *new* and *exiciting* stuff. Most of the content that was added recently, had already existed before Kabam was in control. It is pretty frustrating that the only *new* equipment, they add are either complete crap or a reskin of an already existing item. About 3 months ago, I stopped playing this game since I already have achieved most of the stuff I can achieve and new content is either really boring or not important because it doesn't drop important stuff. Also RNG is a pretty HUGE factor here which doesn't make the game as fun, when your friends have 300 hours less and just get an item you have been searching for 300 hours.  I am still *recommending* this game because it is pretty fun as long as you have new content which you always have when just starting the game. After achieving everything, the game is not really fun to play. The perma-death aspect of the game is interesting but can be REALLY frustrating due dying because of lag isn't that rare. (No refund btw)  GL HF anyway guys.
8938	0	a	This game is definitely one of the worst ones I have ever played. Would not recommend at all.
8939	0	a	What the F### I use to play this game befor the bad update And I lost good stuff because It was in a gift chest and they took it away so I can not have it or store any items ):!
8940	0	a	Aren't you just tired of your games being fun.  Then this game is for you!
8941	0	a	I used to play this game a lot on Kongregate. It's dissapointing to see that Kabam has taken over and turned this game into a pay to win wreck. I used the small amount of pay-to-aquire currency that you start out with to buy a cosmetic repaint for the Knight, figuring it was the only thing I could afford and I sure as all heck wasn't going to pay for the currency. Looked pretty cool, went too far into the map and got killed instantly by a high level boss, and whaddya know, the item I payed with money currency is gone. That's right, if you pay for an item, wether it be cosmetic or weapon or whatever, with REAL money, you still lose it upon death. And these are not just 10 cent sticks or knives, but 8 dollar weapons that kill everything in an extremely small amount of hits that you waste by accidentally getting too close to a giant snail.  It's a shame, it really is.
8942	0	a	Do not download this game unless you want to spend countless hours collecting items and then losing all of them
8943	0	a	Everything can be bought for real money and it takes forever to max stats fun for a while but dies quick
8944	0	a	this is a csgo simulator. plant the bomb and... KABLAM your ♥♥♥♥ is ♥♥♥♥ed up
8945	0	a	it is bad
8946	0	a	A genuinely...AWFUL game!
8947	0	a	The Game WAS good. End of story.
8948	0	a	Personally, I would prefer other MMO over this one. It was fun for a while, but if you are alone playing (like me) and don't want to spend money to have a decent character (like me), you should go somewhere else.
8949	0	a	I almost unlocked every character, then a data wipe.  Although, I will admit,this game was fun when I played it. But.... Even though I had reached lvl 20 several times, I never felt at all powerful. I felt weak. Why is that? Since many items are locked behind a paywall.  Let me admit, I probbably went into the wrong places or somethin. But in all my times playing, I should have never felt weak throughout the time i was playing it.
8950	0	a	As to follow the rules and guidelines i cant say my choice words per say. This game used to be one of the best free to plays out there and had alot going for it then well we all know what came next... (if you dont basicly kabam made it a terrible pay to win. yet another greedy ♥♥♥ company. If they need to cover 'server costs' *laughs at the idea* then chardge like 2 dollars for the game. you have no idea how much self restraint im putting on myself right now as to not gush out in a angry rant full of colourful words. Bottom line is this game got ruined by kabam.
8951	0	a	aerys targaryan is back and hes more mad than ever  too bad it sucks
8952	0	a	Man, the managment for this game is terrible, not exactly p2w but money helps, I regret how much i played this a few summers ago, but it's still not awful. Maybe a decent game to play on the side, 4/10
8953	0	a	I admit, it's sad, but on the online flashplayer I have put 2k hours into this game. I have been playing it for a few years and honestly I enjoyed it when playing with friends. I understand this is a perma-death game, and if you want to play it, you have to understand that. I have spent a lot of money on this game, it was not worth it, it lags to some extent no matter the computer you are on, and eventually, something stupid will happen, no matter how much 'skill' you have, or how good your stats are, you will die. Not only that, but if you don't pay the money to get more storage space, or another character slot, you have to start the game over from complete scratch. Was it fun? For a couple hours while playing with friends. Was the money I spent on it to enjoy it worth it? Not at all.
8954	0	a	Wow, Pay2Win, crap.
8955	0	a	This game was good. WAS. Currently, this game is reduced to a mess of cash and Pay To Win, you are limited to one life, permanently lose anything you have been grinding for and is VERY resource intensive. If you want a better game, go for Magic Barrage: it's lighter, has less P2W BS and feels more rewarding.  Oh, did I mention the RotMG staff never responeded to my support tickets in the past when I played it in Kongregate and in their site? Yep.
8956	0	a	Its, repetative, you must pay to win, you lose all your items when you die
8957	0	a	For thoes passing buy, dont get this game its a pay to win joke   first half hour or so of playing it and i find: It confusing how their only seam to be ranged classes, dont get any tutorial of where anything is, dont get told how to ern curancy, am met instantly by someone spamming advertisment at spawn and their being no report button, the fact that the microstransactions are balls to wall inmncane and how incredibaly dull the fighting is. also a perthetic tutorial that the first boss you come accross just says some junk in the chat box that is really small, not to mention their is no escape exit no but press the x button. i could be missing something but come on, this look likle a game that was still in alpha and then had microtransaction rammed up its ♥♥♥ before it could finish itself off.
8958	0	a	The game becomes repetitive too quickly. The classes are barely different from one another in comparison to quality mmorpgs. After each death, the amount of new things discovered and enjoyed shrinks to the point where you are doing the same thing over and over again in an effort to die with alot of fame (which is an ingame currency) that doesn't even allow you to buy anything that greatly affects the game. When I quit, I was still marginally enjoying the game but quickly decided it was a waste of time since each life was less and less enjoyable, which would ultimately turn into a bore.
8959	0	a	I played this as a flash game a few years ago. Back then it was was fun, now, it sucks. Don't waist your time
8960	0	a	P2HF = Pay 2 Have Fun
8961	0	a	The keys were glitchy and if you don't like rpg games that dont save, not for you. Also, the majority of the game is relient on you buying add-ons with money; scince kaboom bought it it has gone downhill.
8962	0	a	I used to play this game all the time when it came out. After they ruined amulets and most guilds who played/loved since the begging killed off there chars as a result i just stopped playing. Wish it was still good &lt;/3
8963	0	a	This game doesn't seem to work. Every button makes the game dim and become unresponsive. I cannot delete characters with the same glitch happening and when I launch the game, the glitch happens because a sale window appeared off-screen.
8964	0	a	Good Game Before Kabam ♥♥♥♥ed the system up im only playing the game on browser because special items u get by playing it but ive been play for 3 years and im done with it i only do ppes. IF WILDSHADOW CAME BACK IT WOULDNT BE AS SHITY
8965	0	a	It's a pretty fun game in my opinion, though it is EXTREMELY PAY-2-WIN. I MEAN, SERIOUSLY, KABAM. GOSH.
8966	0	a	Got ♥♥♥♥♥♥ after they changed companies
8967	0	a	-rep, destroyed my life.
8968	0	a	This game suck balls
8969	0	a	Pay-2-win, want a pet? Pay for it. Want some colours to distinguish yourself from everyone else? Pay for it. Just died and need some incentive to get you back into playing this game?

8971	0	a	Was a really fun game, then Kabam, just like that, its ♥♥♥♥.
8972	0	a	I played this game for quite awhile, and while it is fun and addicting, Kabam has ruined it. The only good addition to the game was pets in my opinion. And even then they take a lot of time and effort to reach a useful level. And they are very unbalanced. Kabam doesnt seem to care about the game or its players anymore. If youre looking for a game to simply kill time with, then get this game. But Kabam hasnt put much effort into doing anything with it other than the occasional end game content.
8973	0	a	Everything that was once free now costs money
8974	0	a	Decent computer + Amazing Internet + TF2 = No Lag   Decent computer + Amazing internet + This = MAJOR LAG  This game = LAG.  Therefore this game is garbage.
8975	0	a	I played this as a flash game a few years ago. Back then it was was fun, now, it sucks. Don't waist your time
8976	0	a	I can't emphasize enough how I loved this game. Also can't emphasize enough how Kabam ruined it. Just stay away.
8977	0	a	I've played this game before it was on steam im hipster it was great but it was confusing as F*ck
8978	0	a	Two words would change my mind about my recommendation: controller support.  This game begs to be played with a controller, and it seems like it would be easy enough to implement, but this is not an option. Even programming joy2key is an awkward control scheme due to having to use the right stick as a cursor control while moving around independently.
8979	0	a	I would say I love this game, and I do but for one reason I can't: Kabam. That is the reason. This game was flawless... until Kabam turned it into one of the biggist P2W (Pay To Win) games I have ever seen. Please stop the P2W aspect of this game. You have destroyed a perfect game and the only way you can make it up is by fixing what you have done. So fix it, or feel the wrath of The Mad God.
8980	0	a	I've played this game for quite some time now (though maybe not as much as SOME people). Excellent in the beginning. Perma-death would always make me quit for a week or so and then come crawling back for more. Trust me, you   always   will come back for more.  However, I'm so upset that Kabam would change what was one of the absolute best F2P games out there into a highly P2W game. Realm of the Mad God is ridiculously unbalanced. Add in the fact that anything you buy for a character will be deleted when your character dies. POOF. GONE.   I hate to have to write such a bad review for what used to be a rewarding place to spend time. What a waste.
8981	0	a	This game was awesome, it was fun and stuff, great to play with friends.  Then Kabam happened  
8982	0	a	It's an ok game at first but when you get to your knight or whatever you wanna max out the grind is terrible. It's just too hard, too much work for max stats.
8983	0	a	It was fun when it came out b4 Kabam bought the game. now its just ♥♥♥♥. I used to love to play this game. i played in the summer 6 am to 12 pm it was alot of fun then i saw the news that Kabam bought out the game. i was like 'Yay thats kewl mebbe it'll change for the best. I was wrong as ♥♥♥♥. i updated it and played for like 2 hours then was like. this is now ♥♥♥♥. #ThanksKabam
8984	0	a	This game used to be great.     But then.     Then Kabam happened. 
8985	0	a	terrible game, unless you like paying to win.
8986	0	a	i saw that this was a great game untile kabam.
8987	0	a	I played before kabam. That was a time when all you could purchase was pretty colors for your character.  10/10 would buy pretty colors if kabam was replaced and p2w model was removed.
8988	0	a	They should've called this game ''Laggy Cluster♥♥♥♥'. Add 'everything is locked behind a microtransaction paywall OR a ridiculous amount of grinding' and you get exactly what this game is; Not fun.
8989	0	a	I won't recommend this because how bad it has changed... I enjoyed the rouge like style in a mmo setup. Its now a very pay to win setup that turns me away. Its another 'It could have been' list of games that failed because using a strong for 'profit'   I am tired of those mmos that spark my interest and even go so far to change it completely for money than for fun. That ruins the game industry or anything when greed is the driving force for a company... not simple profit... greed.
8990	0	a	Stay away from all Kabaam Games Pay to win micro transaction garbage
8991	0	a	stuck at loading screen 
8992	0	a	No linux version and pc version is not that good browser vresion is better but with flash games they usually lag if you dont have everything in the right place
8993	0	a	terrible game, kabam ruined everything that wildshadows created
8994	0	a	Someone has put 11k hours on this game ayyyyy lmao
8995	0	a	Realm of the Mad God is a great all around game however the problems with it are so bad the game is borderline unplayable i used to play the game years ago and had a good time but ended up quiting altogether due to the fact that spammers are everywhere and the lag is insane and in a game where you have perma deaths having lag kill you is the ultimate rage i got it on steam fairly recently thinking well the develepors have all this paid for content like extra character slots and vault chests which imho you need at least 3 chests to even operate half-decent and i was foolish enough to purchase them for this account :( but no with all the money these guys are milking from the paid content the spam is worse than before the lag is oh so real and like i said previously the game is borderline unplayable if the lag and spam would simply be taken care of like any other developer would do (even indie devs not making money) it would be a 10 star game but with years to work on it nothing at all has been done there isn't even new content it's dissapointing and honestly just makes me sad such a great game is owned by devs that won't fix it to make it a proper game
8996	0	a	It was fun 2 years ago but now its just stall.
8997	0	a	The game has become progressively less fun over time, due largely to the increased monetization pressure by the developers and the inability to control the rampant mass of bots that crowd out players in The Nexus.
8998	0	a	if this game got any better i still wouldnt play it because ive seen a 13 year old code a game better and actually have a purpose to it
8999	0	a	I find that the game is a bit glitchy on my Ubuntu system. I run it using a PlayOnLinux setup. Sometimes my character just suddenly decides to go into the wilderness and stop in a swarm of snakes. This being said, of course, this is Wine running, and so things are bound to not be as good as native Windows. I'd like this to be ported to Linux.
9000	0	a	well when u die u shoudlent loose the whole game u should loose some gold
9001	0	a	This game sucks. It looks awful, uses very annoying free-to-play strategies (like posting sales that you have purchase to close), and is a general waste of time. I'm very disipointed in myself for paying any money on this game, and in you if you have also wasted any money on this game.
9002	0	a	this game ♥♥♥♥ing sucks! the controls are cluncky,looping annoying music,and sometimes my charecter moves and runs around on his own like a dumbass!
9003	0	a	You know, it was probably my own fault, but I didn't see the permadeath description before playing this, so you can imagine how frustrated I was when I leveled a character to 6 and then died. Decent little game but that's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Work hard on a character, make a little mistake and poof. Over. That's it.
9004	0	a	the game sucks i lost allllll my good stuff and you cant get it back #DONT PLAY 
9005	0	a	There is a ♥♥♥♥ing problem...what problem? THIs: -The news are too annoying... i mean when i enter in Nexus (starter map) Ambrosia pack is coming and i can't control my character or do anything else... just looking at the Ambrosia ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥
9006	0	a	This game is a good concept. Everyone who likes leveling and farming boring dungeons will have fun in this game. I did enjoy it some time ago but I quitted it after several hours of playing. It was too frustrating and an absolute time waste. It is not that bad if you are a greenhorn because you have nothing to lose but when you want to be good it isn´t this easy because it is a perm death game (with many bugs, unfortunately D:). I began playing it when wildshadow studios was developing it but it is too bad that KABAM now does this because they are very bad at it. Now it is pay to win. What isn´t that bad if you wouldn´t die after a week because of a silly bug. So you wasted about 30€. You can also farm you stuff but this requires lot of experinece and skill (and luck to not die to a bug becuase there are a lot). I would play this if KABAM will change it to a godd game again. Just wanted to let you know my opinion to this game so don´t be too dissapointed if you die. But anyway have fun playing aso long as you can.  Sorry for my bad english I am not a native speaker.
9007	0	a	Ah, Rotmg... it used to be so great... and then Kabam happened. Don't get me wrong, they did some good things but most of what they did ruined the game...Avoid this game now, there are much better ways to spend your time than with this.If you need more reasons why not to play this game anymore then just read the rest of this. Cheers guys!  I remember playing this game back when it was still a browser game and it was so much fun! I spent atleast 600 hours playing this game and knew most of it inside out. I remember the incredible joy i had when i got some of the best items from the Wine Cellar and was able to trade them with other players. I also remember the rage that built up in me once i died on one of my maxed out characters. The sense of buying a amulet of ressurection with fame which made me want to be extra careful not to get killed because i would loose something that is worth so much. Countless hours grinding with others to get to lvl 20 and max out one of the 12 unique classes which were all fun to play.   Trying to kill the 3 golems that kept healling eachother while unmaxed and hopeing that they would eventually die, breaking the mysterious crystal and seeing low level people get instakilled were just some of the great moments of this game.  The cries of joy from getting a white bag and finding one of the rarest items in the game and seeing everyone trade you just so that they can see it. Being in a skype call with 10 other people who all played the game with you was great! Being the one to open a dungeon or a Wine Cellar and not asking for any donations was the right way to play!   Trying to rush through the mentioned Wine Cellar to fight the Mighty Oryx The Mad God and seeing people fall to the mobs that were protecting him was exciting and terrifying at the same time. Killing him and hearing him yell 'No! This cannot be!'.   Drinking potions to make your character as powerful as possible, selling the ones you didn't need to get the ones you needed or to get better gear. Having a unique setup of items that fit your playstyle and arguing which were the best items.   And then, Kabam happened and started destroying everything that was enjoyable about this game. The top items from the Wine Cellar could now be bought using real money! Something that they wanted to remove but ended up adding it themselves! The Amulets of ressurection were now made into cursed amulets of ressurection because of the ability to easily dupe items due to some terrible control from Kabam. The unique items that you used to get were now untradable and with the limited space of 8 slots in your vault you sometimes had to drop them because you couldn't do anything with them! The introduction of pets that made the game a bit too easy for some people (myself included). Kabam did make a new class, The Ninja! Who was, in all aspects the weakest class of them all but still quite fun to play.   After some time i decided to quit Rotmg and killed off my 8/8 warrior who was fully geared with The helm of the Juggernaut/the great general, Candy/Acropolis armor, The Sword of Acclaim, The Demon blade, The Ancient stone sword, and the Ring of the Pyramid. It was painful, but the game simply became a grindfest to not make yourself stronger. It started becoming make your pet as strong as possible.

9015	0	a	Games are supposed to make you feel rewarded. This game makes you feel like ♥♥♥♥. Some say permadeath makes gameplay more challenging and rewarding but imagine how are you supposed to react when a character you've put tens of hours into dies because of lag or because your evacuation key worked fractions of second late?
9016	0	a	I don't get the hype. Theres next to no story/plot and the gameplay consists of Holding down a mouse button and running around occassionally 'upgrading items'.  It tries to be unique by having a Fame System based around death, but the very limiting 'gifts' (Single Character slot or $6.50 per extra slot, Single Vault or $5 per extra) you get at the start ruin something that could be fun.  If you had atleast two or three character slots and a larger first Vault (really a chest fro 8 items is a vault?!) it could be interesting as a F2P game.
9017	0	a	P2W comeon what is wrong with this company???They destroyed a lot of games but im very mad cause they did something like that on this one!

9023	0	a	The game had a neat concept and ruined it. I feel it could have been so much fun if it had more customization and better combat. The combat in the game got boring really quick and inturn caused me to stop playing the game.
9024	0	a	Spent an hour and 5 minutes trying to play the dang game, eventually gave up
9025	0	a	I played this for a little while when it appeared on Steam. I had no idea what was going on but it was free, and it was fun.  Fast forward a year or two, IDK anymore. I haven't played since. BUT judging from the latest reviews AND considering my disappointment, nay, disgust with the current fad of F2P masquerading as P2W due to greedy companies ruining perfectly good games, the least I could do I downvote this on the grounds of shenanigans.  Kabam, and companies like it, you should be ashamed of yourselves. You are contributing to the decay of the PC gaming industry, and I refuse to support it.
9026	0	a	It's a simple, repetitive game that's enjoyable at it's core, but crippled by micropayments. Primarily the tiny default inventory size is what ruined it for me.
9027	0	a	Played this many moons ago. Shot things. Looted. Rode the train. Died....many times. No brain--no problem. Now...no game--no problem. Permadeath takes all, eventually--even games. R.I.P.
9028	0	a	Kabam ruined this game beyond saving.
9029	0	a	This game keeps giving me an error and wont load up, I have several times uninstalled and reinstalled. This game seems fun, but the error says- Debug list out of range. So I can't play this game, but I want to. 
9030	0	a	Update: Changing my review to negative because of how the company treats the game. They are very disconnected on how the game works and they dont bother updating the game at all. The rare event is just to squeeze more money out of the slowly dieing population that they have left. Also I hate F2P games that try to trick people into gambling real money with mind tricks that its a good deal. Kabam sucks at game development and should just give up with there other ♥♥♥♥ titles as well. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Its a good hard game if you dont care about graphics and like the old school Galaga type games with a RPG class twist.  While it does have a cash shop where you can buy equipment for real money, you can easily earn it ingame when you become good. If youre not at that level then you will just lose it when you die which also btw, is really over priced (I doubt anyone buys them). The only real P2W thing about this game is the pet system at a very late level that you may never expierence anyway.  So anyway, you go reach level 20. Do dungeon runs to get all your stats maxed with stat pots. Get good gear. Try to reach 5 star fame by getting 2k 'exp'. Die, repeat. Try harder dungeons. Repeat. A bit sandboxy I guess.
9031	0	a	OMG never get this game, you can lose REAL MONEY if you die. this game needs to give everyone a refund and then die off
9032	0	a	All I ever see in chat is spam, and once you die you have to start the whole game again - not ten out of ten, would probably play again sometime
9033	0	a	The Game has too much focus on Graphics rather than game play.
9034	0	a	Bad game WASTE OF MONEY Hate it Loser Game -rep no pros only cons
9035	0	a	the most pay to win game ever but fun then again made to be addictave so you spend money so play if you got money
9036	0	a	I CANT GET THE GAME TO WORK AND WHEN I SEARCH FOR FIXES NO DEBUG ERRORS FIXES COME UP SO THIS GAME SUCKS!!!!
9037	0	a	I would reccommend if it hadn't been for the last server migration that ruined me. 
9038	0	a	This game made me think about how sad my life realy was...
9039	0	a	Game did some 'maintenance' on my account, and since then, I can't play with the only character that I have, nor delete it. To request support, I would have to create a new account on some kind of third-party site.  It's a shame, it was a good game...
9040	0	a	Laggy thru Steam apparently so i went to play thru firefox and everything is locked unless u give them ur monies. Could only pick the wizzard. Sigh, i read alot of the reviews most people say its Pay to win and even with my limited experience i cuncur
9041	0	a	This game seems intent on not letting me play. There is no play button to actually start the game.
9042	0	a	Haven't played the game in a while, but I heard some greedy ♥♥♥ company bought it and made it PAY to PLAY. Can you imagine that! THATS WORSE THAN PAY TO WIN!  -30 light years/100
9043	0	a	THIS GAME IS ♥♥♥!
9044	0	a	when i die i hate it. i dont know what to press so i just exit the game. make it that R goes back to Nexus
9045	0	a	Very unwieldy controls. Didn't get too far into the game because of the controls. It -looks- good, graphics wise. But that is as far as I could go.
9046	0	a	Can't play it because it wont migrate my account
9047	0	a	LAME! I tried playing it but it was so boring I stopped. Absolutely, Positively, Horrible.

9057	0	a	My game keeps turning grey and i am unable to click anything. So annoyed as all my friends love it :(
9058	0	a	I pray that Kabam someday realizes when enough is enough and takes out the p2w feel. Just make things cost exp like before and even spap on a 10$ price tag if you want and THEN i might recomend it... Just realize that there used to be a great game here until money was brought into the equation.
9059	0	a	Used to be a good game but then i died and could never get back to where i was, then i lost my account -9000/10
9060	0	a	Truly a shame. A good game destroyed by a greedy company.  ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥it Kabam
9061	0	a	Piece. Of. ♥♥♥♥. Hasn't let me play through Steam in ages and the browser version has input lag beyond reason. Update your broken game, you lazy developers, or at least stop providing the content if it's going to be unplayable
9062	0	a	Ugly graphics, so much grinding, lose your character when you die, and classic pay to win feature everywhere. Yes this game is one of the worst things I've ever seen in my life. The perfect cash cow.
9063	0	a	Used to play this on Kongregate Got excited when I saw it was on steam 10 minutes in noticed an incredible demand for your money to do such insignificant things No longer fun to play P2W out the ♥♥♥ I would have preferred this game have disappeared than become the piece of crap it is now  P2W/10
9064	0	a	I played this game 2 years ago and loved it. i had even spent some real money in game to get extra storage and character slots. I logged into tonight to play again played for about 5 min, purchased an extra storage with gold I had remaining and restarted my client. Now game is stuck on loading screen. tried checking cache and re installing it. I went to the forums for information of why this has been happening and it seems my account has been banned. Never have hacked a game and never will. contemplating now if it's even worth going through the loops to try to get my account back or just writing it off altogether. after looking at recent reviews it looks like the game has gone P2W...
9065	0	a	P2W sucks...
9066	0	a	I cant even play the game, it just says Debug: list out of range -.-
9067	0	a	Yet another game ruined by ingame 'gold'. None of my money for you kabam
9068	0	a	Heard it used to be good. I wouldn't know, but if the permadeath system was still intact at the start then I still wouldn't have played. Now it's like any other mobile game: sux unless you pay. So if you're looking at this thinking 'Wow, an 8-bit-style game that's an MMO? OCUNT ME IN!' then move on, right now. But if you're rich like Bill Gates and MLG even amoung other MLG people then by all means, play... some other game. I would NEVER reccomend this.
9069	0	a	I cant even play the stupid ♥♥♥♥ing game, I ued to always play this on Kongregate and i was really good at it and when i downloaded it on Steam it wiped out my profile,One moment its there, And then Kabam,its gone
9070	0	a	Now, I know that my play time on realm is short, but I played A LOT of Realm even before I had a steam account. I could say that Kabam has ruined the game, but that would be an insult to Realm. You see, at it's core Realm is a shooter with plenty of fantasy and nostalgia (hence the 2D graphics that I dig). It has a simple interface with no story other than the fact that you're spose ta' kill Oryx. So in other words Realm says 'Screw story, just go kill stuff.' and I love that. It also has a perma death system where you lose all your stuff, but I think this adds to the fun and challenge. However despite being a great game at heart, Kabam, the new owner of the game, has in a way ruined the game taking it way off course from the path the old indie devs had for it. You see, they've monetized the game at almost every corner making it way less fun and enjoyable. So, in the somewhat sad end I recommend the game if you have some friends to play with, but other than that you will most likely feel like a bag of money more than a pixelated hero.
9071	0	a	it sucks dont play it its a scam
9072	0	a	this game was a waist of my life all the time i spent grinding and getting a maxed car was lost for the sole reason of a broken game so you have no gear and you are level 1...wanna keep gear or have the best gear in the game? pay kabam 5$ so you get to keep 8!! of the gear you find from looting in a bank...yes people 5$ for 8 spaces in a vault...and if you dont want to play the game at all and just get the best gear you can pay kabam around 20$ or more for the higher tier gear pets and basicly everything else. i can see this was a good MMO before the entire P2W systim was implemented but god damn its a ♥♥♥♥ing waist of time (and money if you choose to go that way) now
9073	0	a	omg im ♥♥♥♥♥♥ all my stuff gone i had unlocked all the classes then it was all gone i lost everything im ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ this game
9074	0	a	I CANT GET THE GAME TO WORK AND WHEN I SEARCH FOR FIXES NO DEBUG ERRORS FIXES COME UP SO THIS GAME SUCKS!!!!
9075	0	a	0/5 stars I give this game is not even worth a penny. This is a freemium pay to win game where if you die you loose everything on you. If you buy a good weapon with real money then die it's gone. If that's not bad enough the gold spammers are worse in this game than any other No matter how many times you block them they just keep changing their names and keep spamming. There is not even an option to report them. I would not recommend this game to anyone.
9076	0	a	Used to be good, now just a pay to win
9077	0	a	This Game sucks after Kabem took it over 
9078	0	a	RotMG was more fun before Kabam happened. Although pets and the such are a fun addition to the game, everything else just... sucks. This F2P game has been degenerated into a P2W game; quite sad really. What I really wanna emphasize is the ridiculous amount of lag. Some of you guys might not be lagging, others (like me) are lagging as if there was no tomorrow. Thanks Kabam, you made one of my favorite games into a fresh pile of dung.
9079	0	a	This game is only fun if you have friends to talk to while playing it, theres been huge periods of time without updates and the company that owns it now only cares about $$$$$$$$$$$
9080	0	a	It keeps saying matinence needed so i accept and nothing frieking happens plz fix
9081	0	a	Alright, let me give you guys an in-depth review of this game.   My name is Jordan, and I played RotMG for many years and had multiple 8/8 characters (8 stats maxed out of 8), and had some of the best items you could own. Then, there was mass duping which let to UTs (Untier) items being Soulbound, meaning they cannot be traded. This was a long time ago, and the items are still soulbound. Did it affect the dupers? No. They can still dupe the items, and sell accounts with the items active on them. It hurt the regular community more than the people duping.   Then came pets, and I quite enjoy pets. People say they are P2W, and cause people to be immortal, and that is untrue. Before pets came along, some dungeons took longer, due to either not having a priest with you to heal, or you just got chuncked and had no potions so had to wait for basic regen. Pets just made most of the game more convienient, as you would have to wait less time to heal. The higher the pet level, the more it heals (if you have the heal stat ofcourse). Now, you can upgrade your pet by feeding it items, or buying pet food (which costs real money). Buying pet food can speed up the process, but is in no-way P2W, as a player who invest time can also achieve the same stats as the person buying pet food.  The game itself is fun, but gets VERY repetitive. You grind out dungeons, pot up your characters, die on characters and repeat. The fun diminishes over-time once you have done it all.   The worst part about the game, is the lack of communication from the developers. I was (and still have access to) a closed tester. Meaning I tested content before it was released. I stopped playing the game a while ago (I play on flash player no steam) due to the game finally taking its toll on me. Throughout my time of testing, there was decent communication from the devs to begin with, but as time went on, less and less communication was given. It has gotten to the point that the last time the devs communcated with the testers was 5 months ago. 5 MONTHS! That is appauling for a gaming company, especially for those who are TESTING their game. But then they just throw out another 'Player appreciation month' which is a scheme to get players to spend more money on their game.   All in all, the game IS fun, but it will wear off pretty fast.
9082	0	a	♥♥♥♥ this piece of ♥♥♥♥. Cant acces any menus, cant go fullscreen, cant make new char to not acces nexus.   This is ♥♥♥♥ing dumb.
9083	0	a	You would have a beter time stabing yourself then this game
9084	0	a	I love this game in many ways and because im a half noob and the most risky thing i have done is go into a sprite world i dont truly know what is wrong with the game but i have heard that kabam is putting less effort into the game and honestly thst makes me sad because this game is a masterpiece and it needs a owner who will take care of it and update the game. Kabam just give the game to another company it will be better that way. All that 1 person needs to do is try and buy the game and get rid of the bots and hackers and bring this amazing game back to it's original glory.

9089	0	a	Kabam ♥♥♥♥ed up.     Someone needs to recreate the old RotMG.
9090	0	a	A good game but you quickly run into a paywall.  The permadeath mechanic initially seems either 'gimmicky' or 'hardcore', based on how much you initially like the game.  Keeping equipment, considering weapons and armor are very limited in cross-class sharing, becomes a paid endeavor, with only one chest provided for free storage, with the rest offered for real world money.  I enjoyed the first ~120 hours out of my total 140. I racked up hours very quickly, but the devs killed my interest faster. 
9091	0	a	piece of sheet
9092	0	a	I'll start off by saying, this is a fun game. But there are plenty of issues with it.   First off, it's a 2D RPG/Roguelike/Bullet hell game. This is actually a really good combination, the combat is fun and very simple whilst still having a fair amount of depth to it. The everlooming threat of permanent death keeps the game adrenaline filled even when you're fighting a boss you've fought hundreds of times before. The classes are unique and fun to play, each having their own niche. You can deal incredible amounts of damage very quickly with wizards, heal your teammates with priests, or stun monsters and tank with the knight. Or you can rush dungeons with rogues. Or take event bosses with an Assassin. Or clear dungeons with an Archer. For every playstyle, there is a class.  The economy in this game is based off of stat potions. These increase your stats permanently, and are always in demand due to perma death. The least rare and thus least valuable potion is the speed potion, with the holy grail of pots being the life potion. Trading with other players is a fun process, albeit long. Unlike other economies in other games the currency in this game is always being destroyed so it retains it's value instead of constantly being inflated. This makes each boss fight that much more intense knowing that even though the risk is high, the reward is much, much higher.   However the bad in this game is Kabum. The developers of this game have constantly shown they don't understand what the player actually wants. I've stopped playing this game simply because Kabum is terrible. Things they have done include accidentally releasing a warrior kit bundle for 1 gold (premium in game currency worth roughly 1 cent). This instantly tanked the price of the kit and screwed up the economy for a bit. Another thing they did to mess up the game royally was removing the ability of gland mobs to drop pots. This made the price of stat pots rise until they reverted back to the original model. Again, screwing up the economy for a bit.    Altogether a good game ruined by a bad developer.
9093	0	a	Bad game. You can trust me. My play time is high
9094	0	a	Ok there is way too many spammers in the nexus and there is a lag spike when I go there because of the sheer number of them there needs to be a spam gaurd or something because that is ridiculous.
9095	0	a	0/10 No twin incest
9096	0	a	Before it was taken over and made pay to win it was great. Now I wont touch it.
9097	0	a	Worst 8-bit game I have ever played, please don't waste your time on even trying this game... Boring Lose all of your items on death Need friends to play with if you even wan't to even have a little fun, so many more games out there that are much better and are free.
9098	0	a	Kabam ruined this game. Don't get it
9099	0	a	I used to play it years ago, been thinking about playing it again until I read about the negativity about this company 'Kabam' making what was an awesome F2P into a P2W. Seriously, im scared to even play this game once again and even though this game had so much potential its so sad to see it turn into what its said to be now. I didnt put enough hours into this game when it were still good and now I wish i had. Want to play this again but im not ruining this game for myself! (I know I shouldnt judge it without playing it since its been years but not taking the risk)
9100	0	a	Was Good, would of recommended.  No longer good. Avoid like it has Consumption.
9101	0	a	It was so fun, least when I saw it was Pay to Win.

9104	0	a	Don´t get fooled by my hours on this game, mostly played it on browser.  Used to be a very fun pixel game, when owned by Wild Shadow Studios. Resurrecting ammies,vanity pets,fame trains on the road.  Untill....  KABAM damn bought the game, made everything p2w, YOU CAN NOW BUY TOPS AT NEXUS! SPEND 200 DOLLARS ON A PET.LETS MAKE UTS SOULBOUND. LETS REMOVE RESURRECTING AMMIES.  ♥♥♥♥ KABAM... still miss my 8/8 knight :(
9105	0	a	played this years ago got really bord of it really fast
9106	0	a	This dame used to be a game played in a web browser and now that its on steam it has lost most of its factors for fun like it lags a lot more than it did and you got more of an interaction between other players 
9107	0	a	Can't get it to work on steam or online. What happened to this game?
9108	0	a	I must have put in over 1,000 hours on this game on browser primarily but a significant amount on steam too and it used to be amazing and thats why this game still has 80% positive reviews but now since Kabam took over the game is ruined its now p2w, the charm of the game has gone and the overall enjoyability and fun of this game has been lost under paywalls and a lack of new content available to everyone. (Yes there are reasonably frequent updates but they rarely add new gameplay or areas and if they do its either a grindfest or locked behind an 'easy' pay to access wall.)
9109	0	a	This used to be a really good game. I would always watch videos of this and play also but now this is just bad. I remember when I used to play on the site with my friends but now , just no. Everything used to be so fun parting with friends , being scared of op monsters. And now this is just a buggy game. You start of with some coins then you buy something then you can't buy anything anymore. I don't want to spend 10$ just on a game and when you try to play with your friends you can't cause you can't find the server cause theres like 10000000 servers on this game.
9110	0	a	God damn it Kabam. You ruined everything. I had 200+ hours on the browser version and you just had to come and ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ up. God damn it Kabam.
9111	0	a	This game is good, i play on my browser lot of time, but.. here is more bad than good.   -Payments (P2W)  -Lot of Bots -Bad community -bugs  i stop playing like 1 year, and all my progress just dissapeard i must play again with nothing.. no sense 
9112	0	a	Realm of the Mad god, On some levels, good, on others terrible.  Pros: The game is very open, you make your own choices Classes are well defined, each with it's own perks Can run at 60 fps on a toaster Cons: This game is VERY difficult, I promise you will die every five minutes for the first hour The camera is always at a strange angle, regardless of rotation No real objective, you just stand there and, well, you kill stuff. Some enemies are very unbalanced  I hope this helped, personally I wouldn't recommend this game because of lack of balance, lack of objectives and terrible camera angle. I give it a 2/10  
9113	0	a	I have criteria that must be met before I spend money on a free-to-play game:  1) The game must be fun. 2) It must be monetized in a way that does not make the experience less enjoyable.  Before Kabam aquired RotMG, it met those criteria and I devoted over 1000 hours and a considerable amount of money to the game. After Kabam's aquisition, I feel like I'm walking through the front door of a Wal-Mart every time I load the game.  Having something being sold no mater where my character was or what I was doing tainted the experience.  If you can overlook the eyesores that Kabaam created in order to sell you everything under the sun, RotMG is a great game.
9114	0	a	This game is GARBAGE!!!!!!
9115	0	a	Amazing game, I love to play it for long periods up to 5-7 hours. Decent community, people give away good stuff for free.   However, it gets really hard to find stuff for certain classes and easy for others. I also feel like this game focuses more on paid content than it does on anything else.  There is so much crap that you have to pay for, it's almost unreal. I can understand having paid content, but this is way too much. I'm not spending money on a game that you could easily lose your stuff on at any time. It's amazing that you can keep your pets, but that's nothing.  This trash Kabam company with their greedy money scheming plans. I doubt they even care about the game itself or the coomunity.  Don't get me wrong, I do love to play this game. But the pay to win factor really annoys me.
9116	0	a	This is not a review, just a commentary from a 3-year player of this game (I don't play it on steam).  Like many, I once really enjoyed this game for its permadeath, variety, grindiness, and above all the friends that it connected me to. It was always the people that made realm; many continue to return for this reason, including myself.  I always found niches in the game that were fun for me. A lot has changed over the past two years, though, some of which has admittedly been good. The largest and most controversial of them, however, have very much  trivialized the game . I still find fun dodging death, playing on unmaxed characters in areas not being roflstomped by the ubiquity of OPness now in the game. I do not take the game seriously, any more. Sadly, It is not remotely what it once was. :'(   I still drop in to say hello, to get my dodge on, maybe to help some new players, but I ignore my main and his maxed chars. I'd rather dodge petless with t6s.
9117	0	a	The game itself isn't bad at all, but the in-game purchases make it terrible. First of all, there is no warning that you lose the backpack item or clothing dye items when you die. I purchased a backpack, died within 5 minutes, and it was gone. Great. There needs to be a warning, especially since these items require gold, which can ONLY be bought with real money. What kind of freakin scam is this??
9118	0	a	Graphics are 8-bit, thats just being lazy IMO.
9119	0	a	realm sux now dont play unless you want to see scammers bots and hackers  i have been playing for two years realmeye  http://www.realmeye.com/player/FckArd   dont play or kabam will kill u  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jLtZkEg68E&amp;list=UUOIfXYjehBGG4qpzxrv4-YA 
9120	0	a	I've definetly played longer than this, trust me.... Ok, so let's start off with the positives... - Pretty good ideas - Used to be great - It's F2P - It has a hamburger as a food for a pet and FRENCH FRIES!!! - Different classes - Different specials for each class The disadvantages... - It's P2W, don't believe me? Look at the outragous prices for items that AREN'T PERMANANT. - It's permadeath, now don't get me worng, I enjoy permadeath like the OLD VERSION OF THIS GAME!! Though, I spend hours grinding hoping to God that I get a good item, I get it, and when I start using it, Kabam says i'm hear to **** up your life! And outragously drops my frame rate. Lag killed me, WONDERFUL! - Some of the classes are... unbalanced. How I say this? Well sometimes a priest is here (me) while i'm soloing a hard god, then a ****ing knight or warrior comes in like YOLOLOLOLOLO and kills it, steals loot and runs away. You may say that why won't I become one? Well, i'm not a freakin' 6 year old who trolls people. - They add in very dumb things, such as accessories, or different skins. You may argue that it may seem useful, but it costs quite a bit of money. Plus once again permadeath comes in and screws your money. - To get good pets, you gotta pay or earn it by extreme grinding. Plus the common or uncommon are next to worthless in my opinion. Plus it costs fame just trying to upgrade or fusion them. Fame is what you ask? It's when you do things that are worth fame or become a lvl 20 and kill a lot of gods. A deed for example is to not kill any slimes for your life and you get about 25 or 50 extra fame. Thing is, you have to die to get fame, so you can say good-bye to your grinded to death character. - Lag - Idoits you teleport to you and steal kills and loot (ahem i'm lookin' at you knights and warriors)  Overall, got money to spend? Go for this, a newbie? Don't try ot play this ruined game.  4/10
9121	0	a	Too many bugs and glitches in this game. Please fix the black screen!
9122	0	a	Whenever I play it, It bugs out and makes my charecter do random things that make him get killed, like I have a teir 8 sword and t4 armor for my guy, but I got killed by a hobbit mage. I hate this game.

9127	0	a	♥♥♥♥ game that patched an exploit to change your name for free, otherwise paying 10 shekels. I downloaded it on Steam just to attempt to find a workaround for the original name change exploit, only to be dissapointed. Don't play.
9128	0	a	Unresponsive controls. Loads too damn long 3/10
9129	0	a	Too much pay to win, wheres my mums credit card?
9130	0	a	just f*cking sh*t really. I'd honestly recommend downloading it and then deleting it just so you can write a negative review about it. LET'S BRING DOWN KABAM!
9131	0	a	TOO MANY MICROTRANSACTIONS it sucks now used to be fun 0/10
9132	0	a	Garbage. Buy gold to this and buy gold to that.
9133	0	a	Sadly, I had high expectations for this game. The art is so well done it seemed like a really good game to chill and play. This game is probably the most boring game I have ever played. Along with non-interesting quests. I support my indie games, but this game not only crashes but has excessive lag - could be on my part. But, I know it is the game that handles all the crashing and long loading it's ridicoulus waiting to play this game. You guys may say 'Oh, dude your lame you only put 30 mins into the game.' I tried to put alot more into it, but it crashes and loads long like I said. Frankly, its irritating having to start up your character again after you die. It's a huge pain. It's irritating. Thank Mad God *pun intended*, it's a free game. I would be so upset if I even payed a dollar on this game. Some of y'all might love this game. Most of y'all won't. Astonishing how some people rave about it. Even calling it one of the best steam games ever :/ Pros: Great art, okay concept Cons; Crashing, controls, quests are sometimes boring, very clunky. Would not reccomend. .5/10
9134	0	a	Theres laggy controls so if you can work with it cool. But if you can't it is awful.
9135	0	a	KABAM turned this entire game into a wad of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t pay 2 win. It didn't used to be like this. The game used to only sell cosmetic items to show you enjoy the game. Now you can buy the best items in the game for a few dollars. It's ♥♥♥♥. Don't play it, and don't buy anything from it for certain.
9136	0	a	Doesn't work for me on windows or mac, through steam or firefox or chrome.
9137	0	a	I remember the good days where realm was fun and if you died you would be like ♥♥♥♥. Then you would stop playing for a day and be like hmm lets try again. Attempt number 2 you get some good loot and items maybe even start maxing you character.   1-2 Years later muiltiboxers muiltiboxers everywhere . . . if you dont know what a muiltiboxer is then I will tell you A muiltiboxer is somebody that creates muiltiple characters on muitiple accounts and runs around stealing everyones loot and causing more lag that a full server trying to do oryx, if any of you know how bad that is then you know how I feel every time I see a muiltiboxer.  I am still playing this game to this day and I honestly dont even know why i am still playing it, it's either pay to win or hack to win. Well at least you can get the hacks for free so thats something.
9138	0	a	It's a micro transaction farm. It's ok if you want to just pick up something throw down a few minutes mindlessly killing the next monster, but other than that, this isnt a game work spending anything on at all. I think I'll keep it because it's small and quick to pick up or put down.
9139	0	a	cant name charatcter and am stuck on nexus because screen went grey tintet and cant click anything or walk
9140	0	a	Ok the reason im typeing this is bacuse the game wont let me make an account and every time I click play is brings me up to put in my birth date and when I do it says its not right so this game is garbauge I wanted to play it but I cant.
9141	0	a	Graphics are nice, but it's a MASSIVE grind fest. Takes ages of repetitive crap to maybe get a character to level 20
9142	0	a	BLEEEEEECH YOUR EYES AFTER PLAYING THIS GAME I PLAYED FOR 62 MINS AND THEN MY FRIEND hopper69 TRIED TO GET ME TO PLAY AND I TRIED TO SHOOT HIM , SO DON'T CLICK THAT BUTTON I WARN U FOR YOUR SAKE AND HUMANITY
9143	0	a	absolutely boring you gotta be a poor as* to play this cuz all other games too exspensive
9144	0	a	This game became bad it was boring and silly and its really really hard.
9145	0	a	This game is one of those old dungon games, where you run around killing monsters to get drop items like weapons,armor, pets(rare), mana and health potions. One down fall to this game is that if you die with your character, like say the archor, you will lose all items you get for your character and be forced to start from lvl 1. This next one gets me, when you enter the game you are hit by these adds. No big deal right. WRONG there are three different adds that you have to exit out of the game in order to exit out of the add itself. Oh and sometimes that add comes back. This can happen not just once or twice but as many times as these ppl like. For me personally it was a grand total of 7 times. Yay! Just so I don't bash this game totally, this game is not computer intensive at all it takes secs to download. Lets not for get about the most madening part if you want to buy something, if your foolish enough, you can't make a ingame purchase. Why does me opinion matter well to you it may not so take this a friendly warning frustration on high lvls may occure.
9146	0	a	Boring. All classes are generic and the same. Warrior that shoots bullets out of his sword? Yeah, right.
9147	0	a	i love it, but i only launched it once, played then stopped to play fallout 3 on my xbox 360. i launched realm of the mad god again, but it was stuck loading, some discussions say that could be because you r banned, but all i said was this: 'hi! how is everyone?' so i either a glitch/bug, or very ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ admins/mods/etc.
9148	0	a	Horrible content updates, pay-to-win, unstable, poor community, and awful publishing team (I'd say development, but they don't develop anything but cash grabs).  Used to be great unfortunately.
9149	0	a	'Its great!' A simple review in a simpler time. Almost 4 years ago now. Back when I loved this game I palyed it non stop it was pretty much all my free time.  Now I look at it haven't touched it in years. Though not entirely my fault on that one.  I got an odd glitch not one thats exactly rare as I know many who have I can't access my account.  I can't play with any of my characters or use any of the perks such as extra charater slots I paid real money for and inventory space back when this was the game I loved. Now its full of problems, pay to win, and bots so many bots. I used to run a guild became the top on our server. Made tons of friends and enjoyed a game together we shared happy memories and sad ones like when my five star priest finally bit the dust due to lag. Still I loved this game and wish I could play again at times, but then I remember I am forever stuck on the log in screen able to see my account my characters but never able to play because the company doesn't care.
9150	0	a	I crawl back when I'm bored enough to not even play games in japanese... What do the hours say about my life?
9151	0	a	its a good game, ive played 1K+ on kong, but the commuinity is going to ♥♥♥♥ and its becoming more p2w by the second, i honestly dont recomend it because of how money hungry kabam is.
9152	0	a	for shame this was one of the best 2 pixalted games i played but it seems the community has mostly all but died. and there are alot of bots i used to love this game even though i died a good amount of times :( please kabam fix it and dont lelave your players disappointed.
9153	0	a	Worst game of all time, this used to make me happy. But now its just some kind on crappy game full of lag. I bet you $10000000 that Kabam wont fix it. I want wildshadow back, they were actually caring about the game. Unlike its new owner, I recommend you NOT to play this. Its just a waste of your time, let Kabam go bankrupt. Because as soon as you play this, you will regret it.
9154	0	a	they cheap my money that y i left
9155	0	a	I can't figure out how to ♥♥♥♥ing start the game.
9156	0	a	This is a great game in many ways but there is one very important flaw. The lag. The only reason I die is because of lag. The only reason I can't kill the enemies is because of lag. The only reason I can't get a health potion in time is because of that lag. I want this lag fixed. And NO it is NOT because of other players. Because it will happen when I am on servers by myself or with not many players. It is not my computer and it is not my high running internet. The reason this lag is so frustrating is because the fact that dodging attacks is the only way you can stay alive. And it is kinda hard to dodge when I have let go of the button making me go left, but I continue to go left for another 5 seconds. When that lag is fixed I will be happy to change my review because this game has alot of good qualities.
9157	0	a	This game is just one big skinners box. It's simplistic to the point of fault.
9158	0	a	The menu keeps constantly breaking and making it unable to play. 0/10. 
9159	0	a	f**k u and ur realm of mad god the movements f***ed up
9160	0	a	It won't load and its damn annoying,hell I tried deleting it and reinstalling and even hacking to play,but nope nothing works. 10/10-Crap n spammers won't stop!
9161	0	a	Been playing this game since its release on and off.  Pros:  -Really fun way to pass time. -Good game alone or with friends. -Simple concept but deepens in complexity the more you get into it. -Pretty decent replayability.  Cons:   -The company that makes this game pretty much doesn't give a single ♥♥♥♥ about the playerbase anymore aside from milking money through your ♥♥♥♥, or the small group of dedicated developers. -Getting into the game post level 20 such as maxing stats, obtaining uts, or trading CAN BE difficult for players to learn. -Beggars and Spambots are ♥♥♥♥ing everywhere and every reset the bots return. In addition a few are starting to PM you and if you block them a different one will spam you. -Kinda P2W, its complicated. -Since pets released the game has been in a constant broken state. If you have the right pet+class+stats you can be pretty close to immortal.  -Trying to level pets beyond rare or so is practically a joke without paying money. -Major updates come out maybe every century.  Personal Comments: ♥♥♥♥ pets, ♥♥♥♥ Kabam, ♥♥♥♥ Wildshadow for selling this game to them, and condolences to the developers.   Edit: Oh yeah, multiboxers and hackers are everywhere.
9162	0	a	Great concept, but everything is broken. And apparently has been for several years.
9163	0	a	Used to love this game when it was on Kongregate but now there are spammers everywhere, ads everywhere and i can't even sign in because nothing works
9164	0	a	Personally during the short time playing i can honestly say its a bit of a drag to play a character level up to a decent level and the die only to have NOTHING to benefit from all the work you put in previously. add to that the obscene amount of pay to win gear its a shameful display. though i understand the devs need to make some form of money off of the game theres more than enough money to be earned from just cosmetic items alone without sacrificing the whole reason for playing the game , that being getting good gear from beating baddies. so if i can give one bit of advice to the devs for this game. improve the drop system, give longer lasting players more benefits from surviving the more chaotic later level nonesense and REMOVE THE PURCHASABLE WEAPONS AND GEAR WITH STAT BOOSTERS BECAUSE IT MAKES THE GAME SO MUCH LESS FUN!
9165	0	a	this game doesnt even let me play it i have uninstalled it and reinstalled it still doesnt work 
9166	0	a	Remember those really old browser games that used to kick ♥♥♥ when you were, like, 12? Imagine ♥♥♥♥ like that making it on steam and their devs are pretending that these versions are better.
9167	0	a	This game has really bad controls. If I wan to ruun away from a fight the person just go's on it own, which i really don't like about. When this game is fixs, i will play more of it.
9168	0	a	Does not let me connect. it is better on a Antoher website
9169	0	a	The game was fun and now it sucks, don't play it.
9170	0	a	This game is cheap underwhelming unbalanced and frankly a disgrace to mmorpg shooters everywhere. HOWEVER you wont be able to stop playing it, and youll hate yourself a little bit more every time you click that restart button.
9171	0	a	No longer recommend this game, new company made it pay to win in addition to this i can no longer play as they ask me for a username and password even though I am using steam.
9172	0	a	I JUST LOVE THE same music that plays over and over again. it sounds like an elevator going to hell. how about we go to hell instead? and the gameplay JUST GREAT theres advertisors, coins that you only can buy with irl money, and unfair leveling system. its like crashing a car simulater but more painfull. how about we go crash a car in real life?
9173	0	a	im suprised they dont pay YOU to play the game...
9174	0	a	Loads of fun back in 09-10.  now since Kabaam bought it from wild shadow, consolidating its new game with more microtransactions and insulting pay-to-win mechanics than Oryx's own realm minions,   not its barely fun at all.  ive gone through and played again just to compile a gameplay style list i think players should know about. just a few pointers and observations despite the fact that-  I DONT RECCOMEND THIS GAME ANYMORE.  1. do NOT trust anyone leading you into a dungeon alone. now half the time they lead you in there to watch you die. either to have you as an easy meat sheild or distraction to get to the loot theyre after, or to litterally just watch you die while they're safely hacked inside the walls. for the sake of the troll.  2. the god lands should only be traversed as the elite players carve their way through there. you can soak up the xp as they're killing everything, and you yourself can take on only 1 of those gods at a time. be wary as a big group of gods can and will cut your escape off and surround you.  3.  XP TRAINS A MYTH? nope. in early ROTMG before kabaam took over, xp trains were a real thing. players would activly band together and run up and down the paths of the entire continent just to kill everything in sight. and everyone would benefit from it.  now such an idea that was the golden age of this game's community, hardly exsists anymore. instead everyone is focused on buying the gear their after instead of earning it by looting the old fashioned way. power can be attained by credit or debit USD now, and not time honored XP anymore. unless you can gather a whole group of your own friends who are of like mind, gaining xp instead of shopping steam recipts, then you could possibly still start one, but dont expect a huge group to make it last... XP trains, however you heard of one, are now mere Legend.  4. creature Pets have pretty much replaced healer classes now.  not that healers were very great to start with, nowadays you should only expect a random healer to heal you during an intense god battle, or if he pressed his heal key by accident. if your by yourself in the godlands, you should invest in feeding your grass penguin with heal levels every item above 18.  the reason why healer class in itself is not that good to begin with is because each class has 2 methods of attack. a direct attack and a special atack. some classes have their special attacks either do massive damage, or at the very least give a buff. the healers special attack being healing is good n all, but not having anything else but just a power wand to cause damage pretty much makes the class weak. and since kabaams implemented policies focusing such players atentions away from ACTUAL TEAM WORK towards more pay to win methods, well. i digress. get your hands on a pet that heals, level up that heal level, and good luck trying to play healer.  5. try not to hang around the spawn anymore, im saying this to you, new players.  since kabaam has implemented its pay to win shop changes, half or at least 75% of the server's population is now populated not in the god lands anymore, but in the item market. along with ADVIRTISING BOTS. also do not waste your time trying to communicate with anyone in spawn.  5 - a do not try to communicate with any other living being in the spawn. the advirtising bots have completely ♥♥♥♥♥ the chat. and IF possibly there isnt a bot in the spawn by what ever providence of GOD or luck, the chat is also spammed with players trying to trade their god teir weapons with inventroy fulls of DEF or DEX pots. (which btw is the only trade based currency now.) 5 - b  DO NOT go to any website advirtised by those bots. the chances of your computer being hacked to your credit card information being stolen are VERY HIGH. 5 - c not sure if anyone cares at this point, but why the actual butt ♥♥♥♥ hasnt anyone enforcing EULA agreements taken action against those advirtised websites?? guess evven they dont give a ♥♥♥♥ either.  6. your minimal gameplay area is anywhere from the beaches until the mid god lands.  as soon as you see snow, check if your gear is good enough. because the items your most likely and honestly equiped with from looting isnt going to be strong enough without having a good stretegy of wearing down an enemy whilst running away from them.  7. ignore that new random prancing candyman guy, his dungeon he leads you to however pretty looking is far too strong for you to go alone. also ignore those forgotten avatars. they wont be able to be killed by you alone unless your patient enough to stay playing for at least 2 days streight. and actually not very many people want to waste their time on those. the most players you can ban together to battle one is usually 5 or 6. its because that boss is so damn overly defended and powerful. i myself have never actually lived long enough or even played long enough to see whatever kind of reward defeating a avatar gives...  8. take note, the only reason why i play is to mill lower easily killable enemies to max my fame points. i dont even hold onto a character for that long anyway. the only bosses i care to go after are liches and mostly Ent ancients. so as i can end the world map and laugh at people trying to defeat oryx.
9175	0	a	I love the game, it's fast paced, has permadeath but i REALLY hate the fact that 95% of the game is pretty much a heapful of microtransactions. .. . It's like finding a portal 9999 lightyears away from earth just to find out you need 1000 of each type of money in the galaxy just to enter the portal.  . . . . . . . . . . . . . Don't be greedy..... think about the free users.....
9176	0	a	The Game is good but you need super internet for it to work. if your internet stops and comes back your dead.
9177	0	a	Lately this game has been getting worse and worse. And this new update was worthless but then they had to make a statement. They put in a 175 second delay on any teleport other than i guild member! IHATE THAT!!! it was better ages ago
9178	0	a	Played it for about 15 minuets then left as i was a** blasted with microtransactions
9179	0	a	a waste of time. if you spend money on this game you might as well be throwing it in a fire
9180	0	a	Realm of the Mad God is a great all around game however the problems with it are so bad the game is borderline unplayable i used to play the game years ago and had a good time but ended up quiting altogether due to the fact that spammers are everywhere and the lag is insane and in a game where you have perma deaths having lag kill you is the ultimate rage i got it on steam fairly recently thinking well the develepors have all this paid for content like extra character slots and vault chests which imho you need at least 3 chests to even operate half-decent and i was foolish enough to purchase them for this account :( but no with all the money these guys are milking from the paid content the spam is worse than before the lag is oh so real and like i said previously the game is borderline unplayable if the lag and spam would simply be taken care of like any other developer would do (even indie devs not making money) it would be a 10 star game but with years to work on it nothing at all has been done there isn't even new content it's dissapointing and honestly just makes me sad such a great game is owned by devs that won't fix it to make it a proper game
9181	0	a	Someone has put 11k hours on this game ayyyyy lmao
9182	0	a	stuck at loading screen 
9183	0	a	No linux version and pc version is not that good browser vresion is better but with flash games they usually lag if you dont have everything in the right place
9184	0	a	Used to be a fun and enjoyable game, when I used to play this on the browser often. I saw this on steam and thought I would try again, it seems that this game has just turned into a giant cash grab. I would rather pay a bit up front and avoid all of that.
9185	0	a	it's a terrible game, full of spammers and is a pay2win. you must pay for all the things you want! you want a staff? you have a weak staff and you want another staff? PAY 9999999$ and you can have the best staff of this fu**ing game. and the graphics... THE FU**ING GRAPHICS! it's terrible. don't play this game, it's a waste of time and memory.
9186	0	a	I played this game when it was initially released and it used to be really fun and truely F2P. Now, apparently since this new company took over, the game is flooded with things you can buy with gold. I was shocked after coming back after more than a year... seriously: don't bother with this game anymore. It used to be fun, but now it's going down.
9187	0	a	Maybe its just me but i just dont think its any fun. Don´t really like the Design of the game but i guess it could be fun for Pixelfans.
9188	0	a	comic book guy voice  dear creators of this bullcrap game, I commend you at your enormous short comings both creativity and entertainment value.
9189	0	a	bad game i was rich then the value of my items went down nillys realm is better
9190	0	a	This game is a big waste of time perma-death is a mother****** don't bother.
9191	0	a	Finally, after YEARS of complaints, they fixed the game. Scroll down for TLDR.  Long story: When you first made an account for this game, you didn't need an email, just like how runescape used to be where you had an email, but didn't need it to log in ever unless you needed to buy membership or submit a ticket, etc, etc. So when the new studio took over and made it so steam users who had already played the game, had amassed fortunes, gotten tons of high tier items, even owned a guild like me and my friends, unable to play, I didn't take another glance and I watched as the thumbs down reviews came flooding in. Reason we couldn't play was because we had to sync our steam account... to our email used for our account on the game when re registered. Hint hint if you didn't remember everything above, we didn't need an email to register an account. Therefore we couldn't log in ever again. It's been YEARS, and as I stated above, they FINALLY got it so you can be synced to the game correctly.  So here's the good and the bad part of the review.  Good: -Simple but challenging -Permadeath system is fun still and makes you evaluate risk vs reward -You don't NEED to buy anything from the market, you can earn most of it through effort in game.  Bad: -Graphics, of course, but it's still fun. -P2P/P2W heavy. This is the WORST game for F2P in existance. You have to use real money for bank slots. Enough said. -Did I say P2P/P2W heavy already? -Gets very repetitive after unlocking all classes. -No clear guide in game as to obtaining higher tier items.  TLDR: Needed an email to play in 2014-15, you didn't need one in 2013 when it started, steam users couldn't play ever again, now they can.  All in all, I enjoyed this game alot when I played with my friends, or when joining up with an 'Exp Train' and I'd definitely recommend you to try it at least. If the pay to play/win gets too much for you, it's a free game, just dip out and come back whenever.  My rating? Eh, 6/10, the new company really ♥♥♥♥ed over everything, least it's not Maplestory... *shivers*     Edited after 5 minutes - Nevermind, it synced my account but still asks for an email that doesn't exist to the account. 1/10, sorry everyone, unless you're a new player, you're ♥♥♥♥ed.
9192	0	a	Used 2 be gr8 but has now become pay 2 play thanks to KABAM.

9197	0	a	WHY DID THEY MAKE IT PAY TO WIN WTF  Wildshadow had a real gem with this game, but then the fire na- Kabam decided to take over. Now it's just players running rampant with god tier crap they bought with actual money, not to mention hackers and all that stuff. Sad times...
9198	0	a	i cant play this game on mac alway i open it it go out and dont open
9199	0	a	the game itself is very simple and easy to learn. it's fun and challenging, and very teamwork oriented.   the community is filled with complaining children and bots, and it has some serious display bugs.  meh/10
9200	0	a	yes and no kbam is too freakin greedy and they removed ammys and all these freakin reskins!
9201	0	a	As much as I love this game, Kabam was the worst thing that happened to this game. Still playable, yes, but filled with micro- no, mega-transactions.
9202	0	a	NES had better graphics
9203	0	a	Cashgrab. Everything fun is gated behind spending real money.
9204	0	a	I feel like this would be an amusing game if, instead, you could just buy the game on the cheap and never be required to use a cash shop.
9205	0	a	Wish I could hit the play botton on the charaters but I seem to have miss placed it

9209	0	a	I was playing this game, but then my mum walked. Switched to Porn, it's easier to explain then this polluted mess
9210	0	a	ROTMG looked in Shadow Studios' eyes. 'Daddy, you're not going to sell me to this bad man, are you?'  'He's not a bad man, honey.'  'Thank you,' Kabam said, shooting ROTMG a threatening glance but quickly recovered to kindness in his eyes when Shadow Studios looked up again. ROTMG hid behind Shadow Studios. 'Shadow, buddy, I can take better care of him than you can. I'm simply better equipped. I have a regular income and you're about to go bankrupt. You know this.'  ROTMG looked Shadow Studios in the eyes one more time, silently begging. 'Daddy, please don't do this.'  'I have to, sweetie. You'll love it with him. Trust me.' Shadow Studios gave ROTMG one last hug and left before he started sobbing. 'Where are you taking me?' ROTMG asked while Kabam took him down a dark flight of stairs.  'Shut up, you little brat, and just keep walking.'  By the time they had reached the bottom of the stairs ROTMG was audibly crying.  'I SAID SHUT UP!' Kabam yelled as he kicked the wind out of ROTMG. ROTMG tried to catch his breath on the floor in a puddle of his own tears and vomit when Kabam turned on the lights and yanked ROTMG up to his feet by his hair.  'This is your home now,' Kabam said, twisting ROTMG's hair, and by extension, his head so that ROTMG could get a full scope of the room.  It was a torture chamber.

9222	0	a	It's literally unplayable, due to the resolution being screwed up and the discount window not being able to close.
9223	0	a	Before Kabam bought this game, I thought it was one of the best bullet hell mmos around, but what did Kabam think it needed, MICROTRANSACTIONS. FML
9224	0	a	Realm of the mad god more like Realm of the sad god
9225	0	a	Not worth playing, unless you are with a group of friends.  Edit : Not even worth playing with friends now, go play trove instead.
9226	0	a	Realm of the mad god is ruined potential with Kabam bringing in some EA tactics...
9227	0	a	I thought the soundtrack would be good.  There was only one song that played  FOR EVERY SINGLE AREA.   i cri evry time  ;n;
9228	0	a	Well for starters its fun, and you can do everything without paying money to get gold, but then it hits you. GETTING ♥♥♥♥ IS REALLY EXTREMELY DIFFICULT! Wildshadow made the game perfectly. No spammers, hackers or anything of the sort! But Kabam took over and bought Wildshadow, utimately making this game, this once beautiful shining example of a game into a basic cash grab. RIP
9229	0	a	i cant open the game
9230	0	a	3 sec after opening the game and joining the world this apeears in the botton right corner:  http://i.imgur.com/LXIBPX1.png   can't click it or do anything and I'm unable to play
9231	0	a	It's a fun novelty for an hour or two but the game completely lacks depth. It's also turned in to a cash grab.  You could buy a house with all the money this game wants from you.
9232	0	a	This was a cool game... Until Kabam came along.
9233	0	a	Im always stuck at the loading screen..  fix it please!  i want to play with my friends!
9234	0	a	In it's heyday this game was fantastic. A bullet-hell, MMORPG, roguelike that relied on your skill and teamwork. The classes were varied enough, and the end-game weapons were rare enough and good enough that grinding for them felt meaningful. The constant threat of losing your character was one of the most enjoyable and rewarding aspects of the game, it tought people how to be careful, to stock up resources, and never put all your eggs in one basket, for the eventual inevitability of dying to lag or a disconnect or a risky decision, but even then it didn't feel TOO unfair. Rare items and pots for stat upgrades were at a perfect risk/reward... and then WildShadow sold the game, and everything was ruined.   DO NOT play this game. It's unfortunate I can't recommend it anymore because it has some of my fondest memories of gaming, but the game is ruined. Everything that used to be obtainable by drops from actually playing the game are now all bought with real money. You can instantly be max level and 8/8 with the .1% drop chance weapon as soon as you load the game if you so choose. The threat of perma-death is gone, just spend $5 and get a new character with all the weapons you just lost. DO NOT support this game.  I can only hope that one day we get a similar game, and that it never goes to Pay to Win.
9235	0	a	i'm so sad that they ruined this game when you get tops on all characters and all of them 8/8 it's over kabam you ♥♥♥♥ed us over thx
9236	0	a	itther play game for hundreds of hours just to get good things and then die and lose everything, or pay to get things and almost never die. anyone else seeing a problem here? 
9237	0	a	it crashes all time back in days it was good but now 
9238	0	a	I have logged hundreds of thousands of hours through the main website of  realmofthemadgod.com . I must admit this game is quit fun and well made. However, it seems like the developers have given up on this game, and are just squeezing money out of the reamianing players. There have been no major updates to the game in over a whole year, and any updates they do make, are just adding more items or abilities to pay for. As a whole, I would not recomend this game to any, because it is slowly dying.

9244	0	a	Played this game for hours and quite honestly regret doing so. I used to play it a lot on the browser even before Kabam came along and ruined everything. Used to be great at one point but now just about everything has been completely ruined. Its no longer a smooth experience and just about every minor thing that happens in the game cause a huge lag spike or just disconnects you entirely. It feels more like a poorly ported console game and the pay to win especially makes it feel so. Worst part though are the bots advertising things and worse still is when they PM you those ads. Would never recommend unless you want to be in a foul mood all the time.
9245	0	a	Fun until you realize the pay to play aspect. Used to be really fun...
9246	0	a	This game lags too much, becomes an issue when fighting tough enemies. Sometimes you can't nexus out in time. My game has been crashing mid-dungeon. Major issue.

9260	0	a	there a ugly glitch where u cant buy gold with your steam wallet money please fix this
9261	0	a	This game is somthing that would annoy a lot of people because not only does death actually matter for once, but also it's really easy to die. Also the movement is terrible because the only way not to hit a wall is to go diagonally. Another thing (I'm not sure i this happened to you but it was very annoying for me) is that the enemies sometimes would glitch in and out of the map and all around the map as well, making it almost impossible to hit them!
9262	0	a	Not all that great of a game......... lags way tooooo much
9263	0	a	Brain damaged scheme, pay2win and gold spammers goin g unbanned and unpunished. On top of that, entering the nexus makes it impossible to enter the game proper anymore.
9264	0	a	I played this as a flash game a few years ago. Back then it was was fun, now, it sucks. Don't waist your time
9265	0	a	I've played this game for 400+ hours, absolutely loved it. But, when you get more experienced as the game goes along, the game turns into just a big grind. Now lets get to the owners of the game; Kabam. Kabam does next to nothing to update the game, fix bugs, etc. Game was great, but could be better.
9266	0	a	A friend and I once put money into this game, as we wanted to be colorful and all that jazz. We were having a great time, until the fire nation atta- err... until we logged on one day and our items were gone. I attempted to contact the developers, but they never got back to me. When I first played this game, I was really into it. I spend a few hours in it, and I would probably still playing it if I hadn't had this bad experience.
9267	0	a	You lose even your $5 customization option on death? How about you play a different crapfest instead.
9268	0	a	What a well balanced, unique and fun perma death RPG. All classes have their own roles in teamfights and you dont have to pay to have fun in this game.       Wait a minuite....... KAAAABAAAAM!!??!?! HOW DARE YOU RUIN THIS GOOD GAME!!??!!? FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK
9269	0	a	i dont know how to change the cam???
9270	0	a	*sigh...*  This game has an unreasonable amount of lag these days... It's not even playable anymore.  And oh yeah, Kabam.
9271	0	a	Kabam ruined this awesome game
9272	0	a	A robust top-down MMORPG, fun for all ages. Each class has separate perks and items within the virtual world of Realm of the Mad God. Huge community, many servers and options for playability. You can level each class up to 20, then grow fame to earn special shop items after maxed at level 20. Cross platform MMO experience is enjoyable across OSX, PC and Java.  Now, the pay-to-win scheme. This scheme was slowly built up over time throughout updates and patches. The bottom line of Realm of the Mad God is the business model, which keeps players playing and helps the developers to keep up servers. However, the scheme implemented has been highly controversial among players and ruins the gameplay for hardcore-styled players. Considering the only way to actually achieve highly-degreed items and pets in order to beat higher level entities is to pay money for these things, is something which considerably ruined the experience of Realm of the Mad God since it's initial release.   The community in this game is what really throws off most players. Spambots hopping on every server and spamming their websites where you can cash out gold, which are mostly fake and utilize data-mining. Basically any form of communication or friendliness in the game is rare since the chat gets spammed with automatic messages from the game and spammers all over the place. Who wants to talk in a realm either, where they're likely going to die? Did I mention gold is the only way to have a decent inventory in the game and costs real-life money to actually get? The entire business model is probably no different from any other bad F2P game I've seen yet.  The inventory in the game feels pretty satisifying with white-bag drops and specialized hotbar items. One thing about this game's inventory is that absolutely every time you die(usually from unwillingly getting teleported to Oryx for the first time) you lose  every  item you had in your inventory. You can get around this by storing items in your vault, but guess what? You have to buy gold in order to unlock extra vault space.Latency on the servers is a pretty big issue considering the influx of players scattered everywhere, not to mention the spammers I previously talked about. Even trying to hop onto nexus is sometimes literally impossible with the long delays and occasional game freezing.   The originality and theme of this game is probably one of the dullest, and storyline doesn't seem to exist. Every quest is 'kill the monster,' and the overall relevancy is unsolid. Maps seem pretty unorganized, and grinding in the game is near possible since the EUWEST server, the server with most loot, is always full with people spam clicking for hours to get inside. Normal realms seem pretty lame with hardly any good things to do except walk all the way across the infinite map to kill 5-6 monsters here and there. Then when you get into the good dungeons/castles, you can't even really play without dying unless you pay for really good items. Basically, the whole point of the game in a nutshell is to spend 20+ hours grinding, doing the same quests over and over again, buying loot, then dying so you can do it all over again so the developers can crunch on your wallet.  Movements are really limited, and any form of transportation across the map is physically impossible. Teleporting is an option, but you'll either end up in Godlands and die or end up closer to spawn then you were before. Pretty much 70% of your time playing the game will be walking endlessly through mostly empty areas. There's no special things like duck, roll, sprint or jump. I understand it is a top-down, but that doesn't mean they can't add features to actually dodge your opponents rather than using nothing except WASD, which is pretty slow.
9273	0	a	how tf did I waste a day of my life on this sheisse
9274	0	a	Wort possible game ever. So stupid its horrible, the stupid music drones on and on, its so fricking confusing for new players. Dont get it even if its free. It is so horrible.

9278	0	a	♥♥♥♥
9279	0	a	Its a terrible game, the Devs abandoned it in like 2015 and it lacks effort all around. It used to be a great game back before Kabam screwed it over with pay to win BS. I highly recommend that you do NOT get this game and and heavily dissapointed in Wild Shadow Studios for selling out as this game once had a lot of potential.
9280	0	a	Because of input lag, i died many many times and used items more than i wanted to. pls fix it
9281	0	a	dont play this and fukc deca becouse everyone in there is gay
9282	0	a	game is good: fun item collecting. all kinds of heroes. hard.  community is bad af: its perma death = they drag on you. you can waste money on this game = rushing and stealing all loot/fun.   i dont recommend this game for people without a wallet full of money. so that 10% of the world here you go.  btw i still play this game i just hate the community. please deca dont make the same mistake as kabam... if i become a doctor i will name the next big disease 'kabam' and for all new players who havent seen kabam. just think of walking around the beach BOOM multiboxer with auto aim. walk around godlands BOOM bots, multiboxers, cheaters and much more sh*t i dont want in a game... if you can live with players that want to kill you then play this game. if you want a fun teamwork based game this is not what your looking for.

9291	0	a	Window does not lock to an aspect ratio, making it seemingly impossible to get an ideal resolution.  Logged in and was greeted by an unclosable in-game pop-up advert.  Not worth the time.
9292	0	a	Realm of the 'give me all your money' god
9293	0	a	'Free'  For some reason the developers of this game are trying to give the impression of it being free-to-play although 5 minutes into it you are already promply asked to pay some absurd amount of money just to be able to unlock very basic content which is definitely not even close to worth the amount. You have a pretty big choice of playable classes but in order to play them you would first have to unlock them and then delete your old character since there is only 1 character slot available for free players. The gameplay itself is very repetitive though slightly amusing and addictive. Same thing for the soundtrack, it is basically 2 bars of 8-bit music (which is pretty catchy the first time you hear it) playing over and over and over until you're so sick of it that you might actually throw up. Maybe overpriced 8-bit MMORPG's just aren't my cup of tea but if you're willing to pay up that much you might like it. I give it an overall 4/10 score.
9294	0	a	Its to pixelated and needs you to have no life to beat the game.
9295	0	a	Too hard for beginners if you die you lose all your stuff including levels quests are stupid lots of lag 1/10 
9296	0	a	Don't waste your time playing this piece of junk like ma friends. :| They think its fun but its only a piece of garbage that they are addicted to. Pay to win, bad graphics - theres better games..........
9297	0	a	Never had the chance to play it. The constant bugs, crashes and black screen won't let me. Look eslewhere for a real game.
9298	0	a	Now, I know that my play time on realm is short, but I played A LOT of Realm even before I had a steam account. I could say that Kabam has ruined the game, but that would be an insult to Realm. You see, at it's core Realm is a shooter with plenty of fantasy and nostalgia (hence the 2D graphics that I dig). It has a simple interface with no story other than the fact that you're spose ta' kill Oryx. So in other words Realm says 'Screw story, just go kill stuff.' and I love that. It also has a perma death system where you lose all your stuff, but I think this adds to the fun and challenge. However despite being a great game at heart, Kabam, the new owner of the game, has in a way ruined the game taking it way off course from the path the old indie devs had for it. You see, they've monetized the game at almost every corner making it way less fun and enjoyable. So, in the somewhat sad end I recommend the game if you have some friends to play with, but other than that you will most likely feel like a bag of money more than a pixelated hero.
9299	0	a	I hate this game. Never freaking loads and when it does, it gives you a land of repetive gameplay and SO many in game purchacees. You cant do ANYTHING in this game without paying at least 5 bucks. This is the WORST and i mean the Worst example of free-to-play,pay-to-win games in the history of ever! don't try playing it, 2/10  P.S. Im not kidding! you even have to pay money in order to make a new save file, i mean, who does that? Greedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, that's who. Its even worse than WarZ!
9300	0	a	What the hell? How did this POS of a game get on Steam? It's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ little flash game with no redeeming value whatsoever. Avoid at all costs.  It was a cute fun little game when under its original devs, but since it got bought out its become little more than a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ vessel for cash grabbing scam. Seriously, don't waste your time and spread the word.  Let this ♥♥♥♥ die like it deserves.
9301	0	a	What really kills me from liking this truely fanstastic game is the Perma-Death.
9302	0	a	is wont load
9303	0	a	Free is good, and this is retro-arcade-mmo could eat some time. Questing seemed a bit redundant after a while, but overall not bad. The only reason I wouldn't recommend this is because there are other things out there more deserving of your time.
9304	0	a	Fun, but it won't load anymore so no.
9305	0	a	DO NOT GET THIS GAME! I already hated the game upon release, but now it's even worse! I'm reading other people's reviews as I type this, and all I see are constant complaints of the micro-transaction system and unsolved bugs. Ontop of that, if you want to spend lots of time on a game just so you can lose absolutely everything, then this is the game for you.  P.S. The Quit button doesn't work, lmao I wonder why.
9306	0	a	this game used to be reeeeeeeeally fun and then KABAM!
9307	0	a	Uninstall
9308	0	a	Sadly, I had high expectations for this game. The art is so well done it seemed like a really good game to chill and play. This game is probably the most boring game I have ever played. Along with non-interesting quests. I support my indie games, but this game not only crashes but has excessive lag - could be on my part. But, I know it is the game that handles all the crashing and long loading it's ridicoulus waiting to play this game. You guys may say 'Oh, dude your lame you only put 30 mins into the game.' I tried to put alot more into it, but it crashes and loads long like I said. Frankly, its irritating having to start up your character again after you die. It's a huge pain. It's irritating. Thank Mad God *pun intended*, it's a free game. I would be so upset if I even payed a dollar on this game. Some of y'all might love this game. Most of y'all won't. Astonishing how some people rave about it. Even calling it one of the best steam games ever :/ Pros: Great art, okay concept Cons; Crashing, controls, quests are sometimes boring, very clunky. Would not reccomend. .5/10
9309	0	a	no longer free to play. When it first game to Steam I loved this game, it was really exciting and loved playing with the random people.

9314	0	a	i con't get in the game cuse error for the verson
9315	0	a	I honestly want to enjoy this game. It has so much potential. It's a great concept with already a pretty nice community, but the bugs kill this game. If the developer would patch all of the bugs this game has in it, I would play it a lot more. First off, on the main menu, you can't use the options. You have to be physically in game. While this isn't a bug, it's quite annoying and needs to be fixed. Next, in full screen mode when selecting a character, you can't press back or continue. You are forced to restart the game in windowed mode just to use the character selection screen. And the movement is weird and laggy, and sometimes moves in random directions without pressing any keys. Overall, this is a really good game with too many bad ideas and bugs for me to recommend it.  4/10
9316	0	a	P2HF = Pay 2 Have Fun
9317	0	a	The keys were glitchy and if you don't like rpg games that dont save, not for you. Also, the majority of the game is relient on you buying add-ons with money; scince kaboom bought it it has gone downhill.
9318	0	a	I admit, it's sad, but on the online flashplayer I have put 2k hours into this game. I have been playing it for a few years and honestly I enjoyed it when playing with friends. I understand this is a perma-death game, and if you want to play it, you have to understand that. I have spent a lot of money on this game, it was not worth it, it lags to some extent no matter the computer you are on, and eventually, something stupid will happen, no matter how much 'skill' you have, or how good your stats are, you will die. Not only that, but if you don't pay the money to get more storage space, or another character slot, you have to start the game over from complete scratch. Was it fun? For a couple hours while playing with friends. Was the money I spent on it to enjoy it worth it? Not at all.
9319	0	a	Its, repetative, you must pay to win, you lose all your items when you die
9320	0	a	It's truly sad to see the game like this now. I started playing when this game first came out and don't be fooled I've racked up hundreds of hours. Just logged on for the first time in a long time and the servers are dead. Pre-Kabam buyout I'd be able to log on at almost any time of the day and have the servers packed if not decently full. The only npcs that occupy the Nexus these days are the bots advertising. Before you'd have to grind out your Tier gear from bosses. I remember I took a break from the game to find out it was bought out by a company. The Nexus was a giant store. You could pay real money to buy tier gear. The pet thing and gear dyes weren't a big issue since they were merely cosmetic. Again paying for cosmetics in any game isn't a big deal but when you start an item shop for in game gear with real money it's kind of game breaking. You break the community by allowing lazy or people with money on their hands to buy gear instead of grouping up with your friends, guildies, and strangers to farm drops. It's truly hard for me to rate this game negatively, but comparing it to what is used to be based on fun factor it's a downgrade. I couldn't recommend a game that used to be fun of epic proportions now presently dumbed down to someone. However I will say that there isn't any other game like RotMG, but it's just utterly disappointing to see and know what they did with the game. For the amount of hours I've played on the browser based version I haven't seen any serious issues with servers, nowdays there's a lot of issues ironically even with Kabam running it. You'd expect quality with a big company right? Lol...Wild Shadow should've stayed independent and although it may have given the developer more resources to add content you have to ask yourself WS...at what cost?  I miss the old RotMG. The one with a bunch of friends and guildies devoid of bots and rampant hackers. When the Nexus was packed full of players instead of the empty handful of advertising bots. I miss the trains.
9321	0	a	This game doesn't seem to work. Every button makes the game dim and become unresponsive. I cannot delete characters with the same glitch happening and when I launch the game, the glitch happens because a sale window appeared off-screen.
9322	0	a	ROTMG used to be really fun when there was the amulet that makes your char respawn at nexus when it is equiped. But KABAM   deleted it and now, ROTMG is a money-making game...
9323	0	a	Another pay to win mmo. All classes but the wizard are blocked unless you use your credit card and pay.  Bad community
9324	0	a	Gets boring real fast.
9325	0	a	This game sucks, is slow, glitchy and has the worst community in the history of games. i hate this so much.
9326	0	a	Lovely game, Very. Just until you get godly. I had a Knight, with items that cost REAL money. I was in the level 20 (max level) area, killing creatures, and my computer froze. It unfroze with my character dead, meaning my items are gone. This game just tries to get at your money then make you waste it. Do not play, unless you are playing free, if so, Understand the drama of losing all your items. When you die in this game, you lose your character, and your items. It is not worth it if you pay money. (Although, the money-worth items are better than free items, especially the armor)
9327	0	a	I like this game, but whan I did some money and gold stuff I didn't get my gold!!! :,(

You can get around this by storing items in your vault, but guess what? You have to buy gold in order to unlock extra vault space.Latency on the servers is a pretty big issue considering the influx of players scattered everywhere, not to mention the spammers I previously talked about. Even trying to hop onto nexus is sometimes literally impossible with the long delays and occasional game freezing.   The originality and theme of this game is probably one of the dullest, and storyline doesn't seem to exist. Every quest is 'kill the monster,' and the overall relevancy is unsolid. Maps seem pretty unorganized, and grinding in the game is near possible since the EUWEST server, the server with most loot, is always full with people spam clicking for hours to get inside. Normal realms seem pretty lame with hardly any good things to do except walk all the way across the infinite map to kill 5-6 monsters here and there. Then when you get into the good dungeons/castles, you can't even really play without dying unless you pay for really good items. Basically, the whole point of the game in a nutshell is to spend 20+ hours grinding, doing the same quests over and over again, buying loot, then dying so you can do it all over again so the developers can crunch on your wallet.  Movements are really limited, and any form of transportation across the map is physically impossible. Teleporting is an option, but you'll either end up in Godlands and die or end up closer to spawn then you were before. Pretty much 70% of your time playing the game will be walking endlessly through mostly empty areas. There's no special things like duck, roll, sprint or jump. I understand it is a top-down, but that doesn't mean they can't add features to actually dodge your opponents rather than using nothing except WASD, which is pretty slow.
9330	0	a	A genuinely...AWFUL game!
9331	0	a	The Game WAS good. End of story.
9332	0	a	It's become too p2w. Which is a bad thing. For obvious reasons. Once you leave the nexus, though it's the same old game, though. Just lost some of that spirit it used to have y'know?  The humane thing to do would be to at least make it possible to pay for things out of steam wallet instead of buying gold.
9333	0	a	This game is a scam. I had spent money in this game to buy pets and other stuff, and one month later they make it so I can't link my steam account to the game and they want me to sign into an account! Also I was signed into my steam account while it was telling me to sign in, If i was to make a new account like they wanted then all of my stuff would be wiped along with my purchases. In addtion to this I had a friend who spent money on the game and his whole entire account of wiped.  Don't play this game.
9334	0	a	I guess Kabam ruined this game, whatever that means.
9335	0	a	this game basically costs 50 dollars now zz kabam
9336	0	a	Well, I did enjoy this game until my account was wiped for no reason... Along with all of my friends' accounts. $10 wasted, like seriously, what the hell? Don't put any money in this game, I wasted my life for nothing.
9337	0	a	Pros: Easy controls Fun to dodge massive amounts of bullets Some friendly players drop decent equipment  Cons: Kabam monetized everything to hell Must rely on other players' kindness (drops or letting you stalk them) to get decent equipment
9338	0	a	I join thinking it would be a good free to play experience, but it turns out if you want to progress pass the basic wizard class at all it costs the microtransaction gold. Everything was bought with the microtransaction gold, and it wasn't buy it and keep it, it was if you die its gone there goes your money. Unless you want an experience similar to a poker machine I don't recommend it
9339	0	a	This game is fun, I will give it that. BUT. Currently you can't sell Items and it can get annoying. When/if a sell feature is added then This game becomes reccomended by me.
9340	0	a	Its very aggrivating. not worth patience.
9341	0	a	Im stuck on loading screen.... DaFuQ?
9342	0	a	Game was good, then Kabam took over it and made it P2W and frustrating grind hell. Never again.
9343	0	a	Spent an hour and 5 minutes trying to play the dang game, eventually gave up
9344	0	a	This game went from a fun f2p that I enjoyed playing on a browser to a pay to win game where transactions will basically just get you the items that people work hard to achieve. Just remember, the item that you worked for was recently bought 5 times.
9345	0	a	I was searching around on the Steam Store for some free to play games to pass the time and I stumbled upon 'Realm of the Mad God'. I read the description and it said RPG, Bullet-Hell, Multiplayer. I thought 'Awesome'! Then I played it... I am sorry but I cannot recomend a game that has so much stuff behind a paywall. Seriously! Everything in this game costs gold. Which has to be bought with real life cash. The only way to get gold otherwise is to trade which is impossible if you are at a low level. It costs gold for extra character slots, the rest of the other nine classes (you only start out with six). Hell, it even costs gold to wear the alternative costumes which you have already unlocked! It cost gold to get the real good loot, otherwise you are stuck with a minimal amount of good items. I played the archer class and I only found 5 weapons, 3 armor pieces, 1 arrow quiver and 3 rings, after 2 hours! Not to mention the repeating loot drops. But thats the economy side. I can forgive it if the gameplay is solid and the classes are diverse. Are they? NO. Since this is a bullet hell game every class has ranged attacks which renders the warrior and rogue classes worthless because of their short range! The extra classes might as well be just different visual effects with differing range. What about enemy variety. There is some enemy variety but they spawn so frequently and have so many similar attacks that most of them feel like reskins of the same 10 enemies. How about bosses? The same boss can appear multiple times and they do so little damage they feel like they are just bigger versions of their minions (which for most of them, this is actualy true). Also did I mention that if you die (because the game spawned a load of enemies on you when you were trying to kill the same boss for the 50th time), you lose eveything!? I am a fan of roguelikes (read my FTL review for proof) but losing EVERYTHING EACH AND EVERY TIME YOU DIE IN THIS MULTIPLAYER ONLINE ONLY RPG was the last straw for me. This game is essentialy everything bad about an MMO. Do not play this game.
9346	0	a	This game once upon a time was a good fun entertaining game but ever since they got bought out the servers and the changes to the game sunk what was once a float
9347	0	a	Just dont even download this its not worthy of taking a spot on ur steam list. Dont even think about downloading this piece of ♥♥♥♥.
9348	0	a	This is the worst game I have ever played. -10000000/10
9349	0	a	Oh my god its World of Warcraft all over again
9350	0	a	Thought it'd be more of an RPG where I could level up character stats. Thought it'd be a game where I could collect items, sell, buy better stuff. Thought it'd be a game with more than one soundtrack. Thought it'd be a game that didn't ask for US dollars to advance.  ... I thought wrong. This game was not fun.
9351	0	a	Don't be fooled by the hours of playtime by my profile. I've been playing this game on the Web before Kabam   The ♥♥♥♥ing money-♥♥♥♥♥s   took over it.  Don't buy this game, it's too Pay to win to play. You literatly need to spend a lot of money to get more chests, which are things you put your equipment in. This may not seem like much, but once you know the game well enough, you know that 1 chest is wayyyyy too little.   Also the amount of hackers (no-clip, aim-bot, etc.) has been overwhelming. So much that it's hard to get good loot.  I loved this game before Kabam took over it.    ♥♥♥♥ YOU KABAM  
9352	0	a	Was fun for the time i spent. Then it got dull.
9353	0	a	It is becoming more and more lika a shop, everytime you log in you get an ad for a purchase of a pack. The movement is also quircky and unreliable because sometimes if you click too much you keep on attacking and you can't move at all. It is just becoming worse!
9354	0	a	Lets just make this a thing. 'Boy they really EA'd the hell out of this game' Or 'Wow this was almost like when Square absorbed Enix and both companies decided to stop making quality games.' Ok one more 'Jesus way to U-Play this into the dirt.' Ok. I'm Done.
9355	0	a	This Game gives you the same feeling Dark Souls does. Very high emotional reward when you finally see those cyan bags drop. or when you max a stat on a character, or when you finally get a good base stat role on a new character.   But, now that the game has been bought out it feels like they made end game so much tougher for no reason, you've always had to rebuy your cloth dies after dieing (and if you know this game you know its important to stay true to your colors), no biggy, but Post company change the cloth dies price went up and so did end game difficulty! :S anyone see the problem here? End game in ROTMG was hard and risky enough, some people might say its more of a challenge now but the only thought going through my head is that this new company gets to suck as much money out of the loyal player base before people lose their minds and quit. It's no loss to them, once they've made profit -they've made profit. It's so sad to see such a great indie game get thrown into the darkness of a bigger corp only for it to lose its true value. Don't think this is a valid point?  -they took out the trading of untiers which means the only way to get them is through farming or buying it off of them. :\ - so now you can no longer use those extra pots to trade up into lifes which then you'd use to buy a high tier item from another player.  I'm not a graduate yet so i know im still learning but I am taking a marketing program at a very deep level and i've learnt about how companies will walk in, buy something out to make a little extra dollar to put towards their main goals and then let that something die if it only turns out to be a cash cow and not a star on its own. and this is a prime example, I could've have literally used this as a presentation and gotten a perfect grade.  So my prediction is that once the player base of this game gets tired of over spending on what this game actually is, they will stop playing, the motivation of the developers will die, because the player base dies, and then all together the game fades into the background and dies with its 100 players spread out through 13 different servers.  I might fall back into this game again every once and a while to see if theyve had a change of heart. Because this has always been one of my top 5's... to the point me and friends used to stream for 6 hours a day and had a decent size viewer base considering the genre. but i fear for the worst and im constantly left with a sour taste in my mouth when i see that i'd have to spend 20$ on what 5$ used to get me progression wise.
9356	0	a	is a ♥♥♥♥ after a while for making a person after diing so much
9357	0	a	The version on Steam is very laggy, and while the addition of achievements is something awesome, the online version is much better, and is much more controllable.   If the people who make this version improve the amount of lag lower-end computers get, as in, reduce it, then this version is unusable.   Other than that, the game is awesome, even if the micro-transactions are all over the place.
9358	0	a	Very simple game. Only requires emptying your wallet as there is NO WAY to purchase anything without real money and death is swift so dont expect to keep any of your gear.
9359	0	a	I personally remeber that personally think this game is overrated. Its focusing on 'BUY THIS COOOL DLC AND GET RAD GADGETS' thats whats focusing on ever since they got bought. And it can also get boring a lot like a lot. 4/10
9360	0	a	Well i cant sellect a carrecter. Thats were my game end. Suuuuuucks.

9363	0	a	the same old stuff...
9364	0	a	Don't get this game.
9365	0	a	Its kinda stupid. Makes you have to pay money for basicaly everything you do. Thats why its a free to play.
9366	0	a	Was a real good game before the LEAD dev leave the compagny because the game BECOME a ♥♥♥♥ING PAY 2 WIN games, dont play it until you want to give lot of your money,   Was an Amazing GAME  Now its the worst PAY 2 WIN game ever made, even call of duty is less p2W than this
9367	0	a	Kabam doesn't care about the community. Don't waist your time on this game
9368	0	a	This game made me think about how sad my life realy was...
9369	0	a	I CANT GET THE GAME TO WORK AND WHEN I SEARCH FOR FIXES NO DEBUG ERRORS FIXES COME UP SO THIS GAME SUCKS!!!!
9370	0	a	I would reccommend if it hadn't been for the last server migration that ruined me. 
9371	0	a	Meh. It's ok.
9372	0	a	This game used to be fun but now.... it won't work anymore on steam.... And I used my own money to buy coins in there! That's a total BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
9373	0	a	Never liked it, not even before Kabam killed it completely. QUIT WHILE YOU CAN FOLKS!
9374	0	a	I've played ROTMG for a couple years now ever since the game was created from the TIG Assemblee Competition. The game has drained hundreds of hours of my life (outside of the steam client hence little time recorded via steam). This game started as a simple and addicting bullet hell online game by Wild Shadow Studios. The artwork was created by a guy who goes by the alias, Oryx. Interestingly, you can buy the Sprites from Oryx's website if you google it. Like I said it started via a competiton I was there to see it grow and thrive into the beast it is now. I leveled and maxed a couple classes and spend hours on their old forums and wiki. I loved this game.However, not all good things are meant to last and the main dev for Wild Shadow got burnt out with this and sold it to the social media gaming company, Kabam. This is where my review for choice goes negative.  Kabam began as one of those Facebook Social 'Gaming' companies. I just logged into Realm of the Mad God, this is what I saw: Beginners Package: +2 Character Slots, +3 Vault Chests, +1 Pet, +2600 Gold - how much money you ask? $20 dollars (but a $60 value). Everything wrong with micro-transactions Kabam has accomplished. And I completely understand that a company needs to make money off their product and free-to-play's use the micro-transaction model. But I think there is a right way and a wrong way. This way is in our face - the Nexus you start in is surrounded by purchasable items with real money. High Level Items, Pets for (almost 2600 Gold each), a Gambling 'mysterious box' vendor, and More. Go ahead and buy a high level item only to perma-death in your first hour and losing the item permanently as well. These are things you didn't see before Kabam got their Facebook gaming hands on it. If you can ignore this than you'll quickly see your client's chat fill the entire screen with spammers to what appears dozens and dozens of 3rd party chinese websites to buy items and stat pots...  Luckily, the core of ROTMG it remands uncorrupted for the most part. Leveling is fun and addicting - late game you farm Stat Pots which turn your hero into a true destroyer. High level items are nice and can add some interesting new mechanics to existing classes. ROTMG does perma-death right - once you get a feel for late game enemies, dungeons, and bosses - you can live quite a while if you play safely. Perma-Death in this game is also kind of soul crushing (but it doesn't receive any negative score from me for that). Imagine playing a character for dozens or hundreds of hours if you're careful enough. Imagine slowly capping all of your stats and getting great high level items. Then you die to lag, to a mistake, to a shotgun spray of a boss... All that time, the items, that character - gone forever. You might question why you play this game in the first place, but once you mentally recover -- you'll be back for more and more.   GREAT GAME --- POOR COMPANY.  NOTE: I do give credit for Kabam for continually releasing additional content like new dungeons, items, etc. You are probably a better man than me if you can ignore the in-your-face micro transactions and advertisements for micro-tranactions from the character selection screen to the main ingame hub.
9375	0	a	Two words would change my mind about my recommendation: controller support.  This game begs to be played with a controller, and it seems like it would be easy enough to implement, but this is not an option. Even programming joy2key is an awkward control scheme due to having to use the right stick as a cursor control while moving around independently.
9376	0	a	I would say I love this game, and I do but for one reason I can't: Kabam. That is the reason. This game was flawless... until Kabam turned it into one of the biggist P2W (Pay To Win) games I have ever seen. Please stop the P2W aspect of this game. You have destroyed a perfect game and the only way you can make it up is by fixing what you have done. So fix it, or feel the wrath of The Mad God.
9377	0	a	The game becomes repetitive too quickly. The classes are barely different from one another in comparison to quality mmorpgs. After each death, the amount of new things discovered and enjoyed shrinks to the point where you are doing the same thing over and over again in an effort to die with alot of fame (which is an ingame currency) that doesn't even allow you to buy anything that greatly affects the game. When I quit, I was still marginally enjoying the game but quickly decided it was a waste of time since each life was less and less enjoyable, which would ultimately turn into a bore.
9378	0	a	I've played this game for quite some time now (though maybe not as much as SOME people). Excellent in the beginning. Perma-death would always make me quit for a week or so and then come crawling back for more. Trust me, you   always   will come back for more.  However, I'm so upset that Kabam would change what was one of the absolute best F2P games out there into a highly P2W game. Realm of the Mad God is ridiculously unbalanced. Add in the fact that anything you buy for a character will be deleted when your character dies. POOF. GONE.   I hate to have to write such a bad review for what used to be a rewarding place to spend time. What a waste.
9379	0	a	♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ i cant play this on linx i hate linx   
9380	0	a	You need to pay with real money of everything in this game!
9381	0	a	♥♥♥♥ off
9382	0	a	♥♥♥♥♥iest Game I have ever played. A permadeath game thats rigged so some monsters are put there to ♥♥♥♥ing kill you in an instant 0.2 seconds. Dont waste your time getting this your just gonna work hard to level and die on purpose, itll be like a never ending cycle if you keep playing.
9383	0	a	Steam login doesn't work, have to have a 'Kabam' account to even access support. Has become a poor quality game. :/
9384	0	a	Great fun for the first 2 days and then it gets, well boring. If you like grinding this is right up your ally!
9385	0	a	It's not working on Mac. When I try to log in, nothing happens (same with 'forgot password' and 'create account'). I used to love this game, but it's really hard to recommend a game that don't work :/
9386	0	a	Terrible a wast of time...
9387	0	a	------------READ THIS FULL!------------  This game was my dream game, until some company striked and ruined it, and its our enemy we wanna face: KABAM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Kabam totally turned this game into a game of piece of garbage, only caring about profit, new updates, items and new classes, but not caring about the ''PLAYERS'' And yes, you heard me well, this game was like a dream to you, right?!  But now Kabam doesnt give a S.H.I.T now! But old times 100000000000000000000/10 And now with kabam 5.5/10.                                 Still very good game though. R.I.P RoTMG (Realm of the mad god And ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you KABAM!

9391	0	a	you have to buy evry thing and i dont think that it shold be for free if you have to buy so much
9392	0	a	Realm of the Mad God? More like, Realm of the P2P. GG Kabam.
9393	0	a	This game sucks, is slow, glitchy and has the worst community in the history of games. i hate this so much.
9394	0	a	Lovely game, Very. Just until you get godly. I had a Knight, with items that cost REAL money. I was in the level 20 (max level) area, killing creatures, and my computer froze. It unfroze with my character dead, meaning my items are gone. This game just tries to get at your money then make you waste it. Do not play, unless you are playing free, if so, Understand the drama of losing all your items. When you die in this game, you lose your character, and your items. It is not worth it if you pay money. (Although, the money-worth items are better than free items, especially the armor)
9395	0	a	I like this game, but whan I did some money and gold stuff I didn't get my gold!!! :,(
9396	0	a	Aweful, ugly, repetitive, and totally uninspiring... Can't understand why people compare this overrated game to Diablo, Binding of Isaac or the Zelda series considering it's just a micropayment-infested ripoff of all those games I honor. Seriously, 8 inventory slots and a storage chest costs almost 5 bucks?!? Just 1 main attack and a secondary per hero? Pure blasphemy! If you want to experience retro atmosphere, play the originals... I immediately uninstalled this crap!
9397	0	a	The micro transactions are evrywhere. You can only play one character unless you buy more slots and that costs at minimum 5$ the fist slot the second slot is 10.... ect. Not worth it after the original owners were bought out.  Tl:Dr? your lazy :P &amp; this game is pay to win as well as pay to play.
9398	0	a	The game was great untill September 2013 when they added Battle of the Nexus, then the Avatar, then everyone left.
9399	0	a	Sometimes it doesnt load and can be very laggy
9400	0	a	RotMG had decent gameplay but it was missing something, a server or realm to keep characters after death would have been nice, and the way the game treats you like a piggy bank was way too much. I'd list worse offenders but I dont like to throw down names like that.  Play if you have a LOT of time and money (because you cant get anywhere without it.)
9401	0	a	This was a great game, the first MMO I really enjoyed, but the buyout has compelty ruined it. micro transaction rule this game now, when previously they were just a way to throw some money at the hard working devs.  As much as I loved it I can no longer recommend this game, which is a shame really.
9402	0	a	This game is only pay to win. I played it alot shortly after Kabam bought it. But Kabam totaly ruined it. The payment system before was great you only purchased decorative items and pets. And more charater slots, which you didn't needed. Now it is just ♥♥♥♥ed up.
9403	0	a	Doesn't respond whenever I try to open it.
9404	0	a	Game is nice but i dont feel it really any special... and i must say that the repetitive music makes me sick just after playing for some time... sorry...
9405	0	a	Kabam ruined this game once they bought it for many reasons,   1. You have to buy gold with real money to buy almost everything and when you die you lose them so it isnt worth it and it made more sense when wildshadow studios owned it because there wasnt everything to pay for, I still continued loving this game after and played it alot. 2. It is very buggy now, You cant even log in or merge your account with another one or even make this public because many buttons dont work and now it forces you to log in now and i cant even play (I wasted $20 on this game) 3. It doesnt have that same arcade like game anymore 4. Everyone is more quiet and the game isnt very enjoyable it used to be my favorite 5. Kabam has useless support. I emailed them to fix the problems above many times they never reply and are too lazy to care about this game.
9406	0	a	The game play is enjoyable and I think it was well done, but the fact that the game has turned more into a money hole than any sort of free to play game destroys it. This game went from good to garbage after being sold out to another company. The entire game seems to be built around getting money, not getting an enjoyable game play experience.
9407	0	a	Thanks Kabam, for ruining a good game
9408	0	a	this game is great until u die...
9409	0	a	Pay2Win piece of ♥♥♥♥. it used to be good now kablam took over and its terrible
9410	0	a	its a good game all and all but to many updates and shutdowns
9411	0	a	SUcks WHY IT PAY TO WIN WHEN ITS TAG SAYS FREE TO PLAY IT EVEN SHOWS IT WITH THE STARTER PACK
9412	0	a	First and formoste, beware, this game is very buggy when launching it from Steam, atleast with Windows 7. It will take you between 5-6 attempts to reach the main menu and once you'r there, do not, i REPEAT, DO NOT! MAXIMIZE THE WINDOW! This will corrupt the game and the next time you launch the game the main menu will be set way off to the right and you wont be able ot press play or reach your account settings.  If the developers could fix this problem someone could maybe be able to actually play the game and give it a propper review.
9413	0	a	i use to play it before it was on steam, i saw this a couple days ago and decided to play it again. all i need to say is the game has became ♥♥♥♥ now
9414	0	a	So deca you want me to review this game, its ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥, your whole movement is ♥♥♥♥, your motmg is ♥♥♥♥, and wtf give positive reviews? how about you suck my ♥♥♥♥, p2w company with ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ admins constantly ♥♥♥♥ing up the equality amongst players, suck it this game was bad now its ♥♥♥♥, ♥♥♥♥ off from my steam reviews.

9419	0	a	Nope.
9420	0	a	great game fundamentally and was basically perfect up until the oint when it was purchased by another company... The game is now pay to win, easy to hack and has a ♥♥♥♥ community. Thanks kabam!
9421	0	a	NEED HELP I HAVE PLAYED THIS GAME IN THE BROWSER BUT I CANT PLAY HERE SAYS LOADING ERROR RETRYING AND IT KEEPS DOING DAT NOT A REWIEW JUST NEEED IT HELP ONLINE.
9422	0	a	I remember playing this game a couple years ago a thought it was great, a good way to waste a couple hours here and there. Got on steam today and saw the game and remembered the fun i had then. As you can see i did not have fun now and it all comes down to the controls of the game they are terrible. I do not remember them being this bad back then but i could be wrong all i do know is they are bad now. You use the wasd keys to move around but dont try to move fast or make quick direction changes because the game can not keep up. There where times i would push a button to say move left and then i would push a button to move up well i would stay moving to the left. There where 3 or 4 times that i took my hands off the mouse and keyboard and my little guy would keep on moving and shooting. This is not good for a game where you have to dodge things to stay alive. I dont mind free to play games and them trying to sell me lots of stuff but if your game dont work right your not going to be selling me anything because i wont be playing your game.
9423	0	a	Increasingly boring over time - Only played for like 15 minutes.   Not fun - 2/10
9424	0	a	This game is very hard.
9425	0	a	Alright.   Pros: Retro style art, fun game to mess around with friends, and... not much else.    Cons: HORRIBLE CASH GRAB PUBLISHER, don't expect anything new in updates that you don't have to pay for, broken geometry and bosses, and lastly a trash can community with spam bots EVERYWHERE.
9426	0	a	this game has no depth. it tells you to kill something and you do it. whoopie. You have to pay for nearly everything in the game. do not get this game. its a waste of data and your time.
9427	0	a	This game is like heroin except I dont do drugs and go seek medical attention.
9428	0	a	this game is ♥♥♥♥
9429	0	a	 RotMG  is a fantastic game, with virtually no frustrating features. I really, really like it and suggest you buy it right away. I mean, it's not like every 5 seconds you are prompted you to spend outrageous amounts of money on a perma-death game, no, no, nothing like that...  &lt;/sarcasm&gt;
9430	0	a	Nothing to the game but clicking the Nexux button like mad and dying over and over again.
9431	0	a	This game isnt so fun after you die and lose all your OP loot. EXPECIALLY if you spend $50+ on it like some of my dumbass friends.
9432	0	a	I have no idea in this game
9433	0	a	There are hundreds of items displayed all over this game which require gold to buy them. There's no way to earn gold apart from using real money. There are no NPCs to sell items to, so collecting loot feels pointless (since it's sheer luck you'll find a human to trade with who is slightly interested in your stuff). Gets boring quickly.
9434	0	a	Confusing, overcrowded and senseless. You're forced into being a wizard for no given reason, complete a short tutorial and are then left to figure it out. Roam around an endless landscape fighting increasingly difficult boss enemies for whatever reason or hang around the jam-packed Nexus where you can experience the full range of MMO area chat pastimes; shameless plugs, gear sharks and trolls.
9435	0	a	This game is bad and I personally believe that players of this game are nazis who salute Hitler. Not that there is anything wrong with Hitler.
9436	0	a	Game is f__king horrible.
9437	0	a	look you want people playing this game you shouldnt just have gold be bought to unlock stuff further in the game. I like this game and all but that part is just gay whats the point in having a game if your going to make people pay, the only time people should pay is if they really want that stuff. Me, no i wont pay for a game unless its DLC not gold. Rethink your way of gaming because not alot of people willl play if you gotta pay for simple stuff. Also when you die you lose your stuff and cant get your gold back so i gotta pay even more to play longer and still be interested in. 
9438	0	a	this game doesnt even let me start playing screw you kabam
9439	0	a	This game was good until it got bought.
9440	0	a	I would not recommend this game to ANYONE in its current state. Since KABAM bought it this game is literally unplayable and i believe the lag to be a part of their money grabbing schemes. All they want is money but how can you even want to give them money when you can barely play the game. This game has become COMPLETE JUNK. Used to be good but it is a free game and even that cost is too much for this junk.
9441	0	a	.
9442	0	a	I started it one time, then i tried to start it again.  It didn't work. I want my five dollars back.
9443	0	a	this game sucks 
9444	0	a	It doesn't work and very laggy says 'needs steam verification'
9445	0	a	This game was one that intrested me on first glance. But, then i realized that it was a game that is basically Pay to Win. It was very dissapointing in general.
9446	0	a	This game is tedious and frustrateing, but addicting in a bad way.Do not get this game, it will suck 100% of your like away, faster than Wow and is FAR less entertaining. And I hate Wow
9447	0	a	Ok there is way too many spammers in the nexus and there is a lag spike when I go there because of the sheer number of them there needs to be a spam gaurd or something because that is ridiculous.
9448	0	a	its ok for a free to play game  6/10
9449	0	a	Decided to download this because of fond memories of playing it back in the browser days thinking that the steam version would add new features and be more streamline. Instead upon completing the tutorial I'm greeted by a gold merchent and a constant barrage of microtransactions. It doesn't help that there was barely anyone even on and the fact that the servers were lagged to hell.  It's ashame cause I remember it being a rather enjoyable game. No I do not recommend this to anyone.
9450	0	a	Awesom and very addictive co-op game i enjoy playing with my friends but its more to pay to win so  Recommended if ur rich and want to spend ur cash in game
9451	0	a	Fun game, not so happy about in game purchases, they ruin it completely.
9452	0	a	While the game has it's moments, and can be very fun when running around with a huge group of people, the game suffers terribly from a huge pay to win system. The permadeath system put in the game is designed to drain wallets. It's just as good a use of your time and money as flushing hundreds of dollars down a toilet. I do reccomend it to anyone willing to overlook this and has tons of friends to play with.
9453	0	a	You waste money on it and Dieeee. Yay so fun =/
9454	0	a	Game won't even load, tried everything on every forum - update adobe flash, air, disabled adBlock, installed adobe flash and air again, now with all the preferences for my computer and system - Game. Won't. Load. Epic. 0/10
9455	0	a	trust me ... your going to rage
9456	0	a	Meh. It's ok.
9457	0	a	Its a rubbish game I absolutely hated it and after about a yr of having in my library I unistalled it ferom my pc and removed it from my library and in that time I only played it about 50-60 times.
9458	0	a	TOO MUCH PAY TO WIN. Not recommended at all.
9459	0	a	Was a great game at one time but now it went pay-to-win.
9460	0	a	Use UT's? Nope.ded.
9461	0	a	fun game, but not recommend it...you can try it anyway...
9462	0	a	It glitches so when you go on the game it asks you to buy something, and there is no cross off button! 
9463	0	a	Too laggy and too many things to buy with real money.
9464	0	a	The game itself is actually, quite too crowded and too noisy in the Nexus. Your Chat gets filled with spam, the server lags like hell which makes you move even you stopped moving. Sorry but this is going to get a 3 out of 10! Even on the WestEU server which is close to me. Also lags like hell. No matter what server you use, you just walk automaticly random ven you stopped walking.
9465	0	a	Meh, It's okay I just don't like it. Not really alot to do and basicly YOLO in this game.
9466	0	a	its never loaded
9467	0	a	When you click play nothing happens
9468	0	a	nope. pay to win kabam ruined the game and make it pay 2 win
9469	0	a	really kabam? YOU RUIND THE GAME
9470	0	a	This game was utter crap dot even worth the 5 second download what a waste of time
9471	0	a	yay free 2 play pay 2 win garbage.  you cannot have a pet better amor weapons or vaults (etc.) without payingwith real money it was fun for a whilebut  now itsnot fun u die u start over. also ur 'quests are ligitamently never ending just dont use up hardive space on this peice of trash
9472	0	a	I die on every shot so its really hard to actually play because the other creatures within are really overpowered sooo i wouldnt reccomend this game if you werent fammiliar with 8-bit and stupid ♥♥♥ controls
9473	0	a	Definitely one of the best F2P games I've ever played.  Or so it used to be.
9474	0	a	2 words. Horrible Game. When you die you lose your character. Now who would want that. Theres only 1 class that you start with and it takes multiple characters to unlock all of the classes. The graphics are corny and the gameplay does not make up for it. Theres no story line and you randomly fight gods (which should be immortal). It is almost impossible to find weapons for your class. Most of the weapons or armor for classes that are hard to unlock. I really hate this game and i would suggest playing pac-man (which would be way more fun).   0.5/10
9475	0	a	Review on 9/8/12:  Really fun MMO, gotta try it.  Updated Review (as of 9/23/14, last truly played nearly a year before):  I can't say I can recommend this game any more. After Kabam took over, RotMG became a major cash grab that I would eventually stop playing. I haven't played a true session of RotMG in at least a year, and I do check on the game occasionally. However, each time I check the cash shop grows larger and larger.  Back when Wild Wolf Studios was developing the game, there was a cash shop, but it was nothing but a few dyes and clothes. It did sell weapons, but it was very selective and didn't contain every piece of in-game items. Now, the cash shop contains dyes, clothes, armor, weapons, rings, and nearly every other thing in the game. Hell, the Vault's became HUGE! When I was playing, the Vault was merely 10-20 chests, and they gave you one free. Now, there's at least 35 chests, but you still only get one. Who in their ♥♥♥♥ing MIND would actually spend that much money?  Which brings me to another issue. The cost of the cash shop. The prices are set so rediculously high, 5 bucks might buy you a little bit of clothes. Did I mention that anything you buy you'll lose on death? Yea, that's a thing. Better save up those $$$ for the Vault, huh?  I will be honest, though. The gameplay isn't entirely screwed up, but when I see everyone running around with clothes and dyes and end-game equipment all bought from the shop (I should also mention that the old shop never sold near end-game equipment), it feels like they haven't even tried to collect anything. Used to be, RotMG was a matter of finding what you could, and saving any really good stuff you find for a character you like in your Vault so on your next playthrough, you'd have a good start.  The game is also filled with spambots at the Nexus, but this isn't Kabam's fault, as they've been around since the game first popped up.  I'll end off on this note (also a TL;DR): RotMG isn't a bad game. At its core, the main gameplay is still there, and can still be pretty fun. However, it's plagued by a huge cash shop that a large amount of players use to be able to breeze through the game without ever actually trying. The game is also stuffed with spambots in the main hub of the game, the Nexus. Sadly, in RotMG's case, the bad outweighs the good, and I can't say to give this a try.
9476	0	a	The game doesnt allow me to see all of the screen. I cant leave the page after death becasue i cant see the exit. The game is alot better on web browsers than on Steam.
9477	0	a	if this game got any better i still wouldnt play it because ive seen a 13 year old code a game better and actually have a purpose to it
9478	0	a	I find that the game is a bit glitchy on my Ubuntu system. I run it using a PlayOnLinux setup. Sometimes my character just suddenly decides to go into the wilderness and stop in a swarm of snakes. This being said, of course, this is Wine running, and so things are bound to not be as good as native Windows. I'd like this to be ported to Linux.
9479	0	a	well when u die u shoudlent loose the whole game u should loose some gold
9480	0	a	This game sucks. It looks awful, uses very annoying free-to-play strategies (like posting sales that you have purchase to close), and is a general waste of time. I'm very disipointed in myself for paying any money on this game, and in you if you have also wasted any money on this game.
9481	0	a	You need Java to run this. There's been a lot of issues with Java and hackers lately. I wouldn't want anyone downloading this and open up any security holes on their system.
9482	0	a	♥♥♥♥ this game
9483	0	a	This is about as unintiuitive as it gets. You get a tutorial explaining the simplest possible things that any gamer would already know like the back of their hand, and nothing else. Once it puts you out into the world, it really doesn't tell you what to do at all.  Even after that, the controls lag horribly; anything you attempt to do is reliably delayed by a good half second - but what else could you expect out of a Kongregate game?
9484	0	a	This WAS a brilliant game. Addictive, immersive, it had it all. You wouldn't have regretted getting this game. But now? It's changed so much. When I log in these days it's completely filled with people spamming advertisements for their scam websites. It's been this way for over probably a year now, and still nothing has been done to fix it. I think things began to take a downward turn when Kabam acquired this game and turned it into a pay-to-win. Just about everything that takes many hours of work to earn can be merely bought with money, and that's obviously a game killer. Kabam don't seem to realise this, or don't seem to care, as everytime I check back to this game it just gets worse and worse.
9485	0	a	Boring, lame, and begs for money.  Don't waste your time with this game.
9486	0	a	no love hearts on swearing dammit shiiiieet DDHDASHFDCVJZLD EWKM,SAFJDBA FJK DNJIASFDNFSDA NDOJIASIOFIBINOZ FUICUCJCKCKK AASHAHAHGAHHAHAHAHHHA NO I HAtwe it i hate YOU CAN DIE FOR ALL I CARE FDMAIIT SHIJGFDW
9487	0	a	Got bought out by moneygrabbing communists and now plays like a game run by moneygrabbing communists.
9488	0	a	This Game gives you the same feeling Dark Souls does. Very high emotional reward when you finally see those cyan bags drop. or when you max a stat on a character, or when you finally get a good base stat role on a new character.   But, now that the game has been bought out it feels like they made end game so much tougher for no reason, you've always had to rebuy your cloth dies after dieing (and if you know this game you know its important to stay true to your colors), no biggy, but Post company change the cloth dies price went up and so did end game difficulty! :S anyone see the problem here? End game in ROTMG was hard and risky enough, some people might say its more of a challenge now but the only thought going through my head is that this new company gets to suck as much money out of the loyal player base before people lose their minds and quit. It's no loss to them, once they've made profit -they've made profit. It's so sad to see such a great indie game get thrown into the darkness of a bigger corp only for it to lose its true value. Don't think this is a valid point?  -they took out the trading of untiers which means the only way to get them is through farming or buying it off of them. :\ - so now you can no longer use those extra pots to trade up into lifes which then you'd use to buy a high tier item from another player.  I'm not a graduate yet so i know im still learning but I am taking a marketing program at a very deep level and i've learnt about how companies will walk in, buy something out to make a little extra dollar to put towards their main goals and then let that something die if it only turns out to be a cash cow and not a star on its own. and this is a prime example, I could've have literally used this as a presentation and gotten a perfect grade.  So my prediction is that once the player base of this game gets tired of over spending on what this game actually is, they will stop playing, the motivation of the developers will die, because the player base dies, and then all together the game fades into the background and dies with its 100 players spread out through 13 different servers.  I might fall back into this game again every once and a while to see if theyve had a change of heart. Because this has always been one of my top 5's... to the point me and friends used to stream for 6 hours a day and had a decent size viewer base considering the genre. but i fear for the worst and im constantly left with a sour taste in my mouth when i see that i'd have to spend 20$ on what 5$ used to get me progression wise.
9489	0	a	Don't play this if you aren't willing to pay. Everything costs money, and if you want to unlock something that you can pay for then have fun, since it's hard as balls.  TLDR der juden
9490	0	a	Used to be a great game, until the Kaban nation arrived.
9491	0	a	dont, just dont even download it. Even if your its free and your download speed it 54235345345345 mb/s, its still not worth it.
9492	0	a	Piece. Of. ♥♥♥♥. Hasn't let me play through Steam in ages and the browser version has input lag beyond reason. Update your broken game, you lazy developers, or at least stop providing the content if it's going to be unplayable
9493	0	a	Ugly graphics, so much grinding, lose your character when you die, and classic pay to win feature everywhere. Yes this game is one of the worst things I've ever seen in my life. The perfect cash cow.
9494	0	a	I personally remeber that personally think this game is overrated. Its focusing on 'BUY THIS COOOL DLC AND GET RAD GADGETS' thats whats focusing on ever since they got bought. And it can also get boring a lot like a lot. 4/10
9495	0	a	Well i cant sellect a carrecter. Thats were my game end. Suuuuuucks.
9496	0	a	This is a very fun game but i recommend it to play on google if you want to pay with paypal not a credit card.... anyway you lose your items and your lvl so you re lvl to lvl 20 and lose your hard to get items.
9497	0	a	ift there was a maybe option i would chose it but there isnt so lets get started.First of all great game fast pased rage inducing fun but its ethier quit severs so you dont die to get lvl 20 or steal your friends credit card because you dont have anymore money so ♥♥♥♥ you kabam. fun but kabam soo yeah.
9498	0	a	This game is very repetitive but really it depends if you like a challenge and grinding and fighting the same boss over and over then this be your game its not my type of game.
9499	0	a	Game doesn't work. pressing play or anything crashes to desktop. People on forums provide as much help as support, which is none.
9500	0	a	I really hate this gme. It is very buggy and just all around bad. I will never play this game again.
9501	0	a	Ok there is way too many spammers in the nexus and there is a lag spike when I go there because of the sheer number of them there needs to be a spam gaurd or something because that is ridiculous.
9502	0	a	Don't ever, ever play this game
9503	0	a	what I don't like about this game is freaking lag and when i stop moving my character it just keeps walking and i die, I mean i had a 6/8 character man.Kabam, fix yo dam game!
9504	0	a	You can't even do anything fun without real money. A game should not advertise 'Free 2 Play' unless it gives a decent experience.
9505	0	a	its terrible i used to play the browser version of it and it was amazing it wasnt p2w like this one. everyone had a fair chance in the browser version
9506	0	a	Don´t get fooled by my hours on this game, mostly played it on browser.  Used to be a very fun pixel game, when owned by Wild Shadow Studios. Resurrecting ammies,vanity pets,fame trains on the road.  Untill....  KABAM damn bought the game, made everything p2w, YOU CAN NOW BUY TOPS AT NEXUS! SPEND 200 DOLLARS ON A PET.LETS MAKE UTS SOULBOUND. LETS REMOVE RESURRECTING AMMIES.  ♥♥♥♥ KABAM... still miss my 8/8 knight :(
9507	0	a	played this years ago got really bord of it really fast
9508	0	a	It was so fun, least when I saw it was Pay to Win.
9509	0	a	the game itself is very simple and easy to learn. it's fun and challenging, and very teamwork oriented.   the community is filled with complaining children and bots, and it has some serious display bugs.  meh/10
9510	0	a	I cant even open the game
9511	0	a	Im not really Satisfied with the Game and the chat In-Game No one can even read it very well :P
9512	0	a	RotMG, an excellent game back when Wildshadow was the one who was controlling it. I played it mostly in-browser while linking my steam and browser account. Then everything changed when Kabam-nation attacked. Ever since Kabam bought out the developers this game has been on a constant downward spiral. It still has its moments but it is not quite the same since they threw all the high end gear as well as many other things into shops for you to waste your money on.  You will enjoy yourself if you play this game. A constant grindfest for gear and stat potions, it is always a relief when you max just one stat on a character. It is a quite enjoyable grindfest though. Then you are back out there destroying the gods of the Realm for the glory of stats and gear. You will waste your life away farming for these potions. And you will stare at the screen for 20+ minutes after you see your best character die to that one projectile flying towards him when you scream that you were pressing your nexus key that is clearly broken on the keyboard.  And, yet, I cannot recommend this game with its current owners. Such a shame.
9513	0	a	At one point this was my fav game ive ever played and then the devs got bought by kabam and kabam made this a pay to win like no other. and pretty much all the old players quit, and you can tell kabam only wants money from this. sad to see that happen to one of my use to be fav games. r.i.p Realm Of the Mad God
9514	0	a	i love this game and play it a lot but really most of the time it seems like the servers are paid for with 5 bucks, and hackers have murdered me many a time. this game is a money trap and def not p2w but its def not a f2p either. this game will most likely make you murder someone also, just a helpful tip, so be prepared to run from the police.
9515	0	a	buy, buy, buy. is this all the game is
9516	0	a	uhhhh... yeh kabam sucks, i don't play this on steam but ammies were great and so are pets, ut i've lost alot of chars due to 'lag'
9517	0	a	It's good, to a point. Once you get very far in the game, almost all of th eplayers become complete jerk offs, mainly trying to kill you. There is legitamately no point in the classes anymore, besides the weapons you can use. For example, Someone may be a wizard, but may act like they're a Knight. Also, stray away from Mystics, as they are terrible at doing the only thing they're meant to do, kill constructs. I can tell you how annoyed I got when one didn't kill constructs on a pent (pentaract). Also, if something like that happens, just nexus, not worth losing everything (if you're playing) because you will most likely, depending on how much you lag because of pent eyes everywhere. Enough ranting now though, If you aren't a Knight, you won't get anywhere according to everyone, mainly because they will kill everything near you, ruining your chances of getting better. If you still want to play this game, be my guest. This is only my oppinion, so if you took the time out of your day to read this, thank you I suppose. I just wonder if this game will ever return to its true glory
9518	0	a	0/10
9519	0	a	Pretty fun but progression and unlocks are FAR too slow and incredibly grindy. There are no vendors or in-game gold you get from grinding mobs, the only way you can buy any sort of equipment is by spending real money on the game. There are massive pay walls for just about everything you can think of. New classes, pets, weapons and armor, literally everything.  It's a shame, this could have been an absolutely amazing game but the developers are far too greedy for their own good. It's worth messing around with on occasion but that's about it. With that said after about 5-6 hours I think my time with the game is done. Heavy grind mixed in with heavy greed is not a good combination.
9520	0	a	I feel like this would be an amusing game if, instead, you could just buy the game on the cheap and never be required to use a cash shop.
9521	0	a	Really really bad game. Maker of this game is Money hungry
9522	0	a	THe game kinda sucks for alot of reasons that i dont want to talk about
9523	0	a	Used to be good. Appears to be totally broken now gets stuck at loading with steam client error.
9524	0	a	This game is too simple .
9525	0	a	an exercise in fuitility...
9526	0	a	I played this game again after a lot of time and it wasn't so good as I remembered. The first time I played it was addictive, I can't explain why but now is not.
9527	0	a	Used to play it on the website, so my record here on steam must be low. Anyways, this game went from good to trash all of a sudden. Ammy's didn't resurect you anymore, the game became a pay to win and stuff like this. About a year ago I'd recommend it, but now it's a complete waste of time.
9528	0	a	nope...just nope... the game is awesome! BUT you have to pay to play.. thats a real no go in my book! if you got the money and you want to spend it on something useless...THEN get the game.. if not... try something else
9529	0	a	launcher is bugged, prompted to log in, I type in my email and password then it does nothing. makes the click sound when i click sign in and thats about it. love the game but the launcher is broken.
9530	0	a	Another pay to win mmo. All classes but the wizard are blocked unless you use your credit card and pay.  Bad community
9531	0	a	Gets boring real fast.
9532	0	a	Basically RuneScape with a budget.
9533	0	a	Not good anymore. chat is FULL of bots selling stuff for real life money. used to be fun now it isnt :( but still funish for the first 2 hours
9534	0	a	The Most NOT Cool Game Ever       DO NOT PLAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
9535	0	a	It gets old fast
9536	0	a	The devs managed to ♥♥♥♥ up this version of the game. I used to play this game quite a bit when the game was available on browsers. Now that i've come back to it on Steam, they managed to screw up many things within the game. The frame rate for me was all over the place, even going down to about fifteen even when nothing big was going on. I've tried it on multiple machines, ones that were way over the system requirements. The controls are now more clunky, as your character can go veering off in a direction even after the key is released. I might be able to get over these issues if it wasn't for the microtransactions. It costs almost 100 USD to buy all the locked characters in the game. I do not recommend anyone to play this version of the game.
9537	0	a	i remmember when this game was good
9538	0	a	This game went from a fun f2p that I enjoyed playing on a browser to a pay to win game where transactions will basically just get you the items that people work hard to achieve. Just remember, the item that you worked for was recently bought 5 times.
9539	0	a	I was searching around on the Steam Store for some free to play games to pass the time and I stumbled upon 'Realm of the Mad God'. I read the description and it said RPG, Bullet-Hell, Multiplayer. I thought 'Awesome'! Then I played it... I am sorry but I cannot recomend a game that has so much stuff behind a paywall. Seriously! Everything in this game costs gold. Which has to be bought with real life cash. The only way to get gold otherwise is to trade which is impossible if you are at a low level. It costs gold for extra character slots, the rest of the other nine classes (you only start out with six). Hell, it even costs gold to wear the alternative costumes which you have already unlocked! It cost gold to get the real good loot, otherwise you are stuck with a minimal amount of good items. I played the archer class and I only found 5 weapons, 3 armor pieces, 1 arrow quiver and 3 rings, after 2 hours! Not to mention the repeating loot drops. But thats the economy side. I can forgive it if the gameplay is solid and the classes are diverse. Are they? NO. Since this is a bullet hell game every class has ranged attacks which renders the warrior and rogue classes worthless because of their short range! The extra classes might as well be just different visual effects with differing range. What about enemy variety. There is some enemy variety but they spawn so frequently and have so many similar attacks that most of them feel like reskins of the same 10 enemies. How about bosses? The same boss can appear multiple times and they do so little damage they feel like they are just bigger versions of their minions (which for most of them, this is actualy true). Also did I mention that if you die (because the game spawned a load of enemies on you when you were trying to kill the same boss for the 50th time), you lose eveything!? I am a fan of roguelikes (read my FTL review for proof) but losing EVERYTHING EACH AND EVERY TIME YOU DIE IN THIS MULTIPLAYER ONLINE ONLY RPG was the last straw for me. This game is essentialy everything bad about an MMO. Do not play this game.
9540	0	a	Just not a fan.
9541	0	a	I would not recommend this game to ANYONE in its current state. Since KABAM bought it this game is literally unplayable and i believe the lag to be a part of their money grabbing schemes. All they want is money but how can you even want to give them money when you can barely play the game. This game has become COMPLETE JUNK. Used to be good but it is a free game and even that cost is too much for this junk.

9546	0	a	'...You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy...' - Obi-Wan, Star Wars Episode IV  This quote feels appropriate for the level P2W that every player has to deal with when playing this game. Thing that you do not have to pay for, vanity items and... extra space? How about treasure chests to strong awesome things you find when playing? Something beyond 8 slots of uselessness to carry over items from death? What about powerful weapons that you can buy with real money and can also lose upon death?  I have only ever played when this new 'developer' took over what, apparently, was a really decent game.   This game also has many neat ideas behind it, but all of them are weighed down by many constricting money walls that force you to take the looooooooooooong painful path which will ultimately send you all the way back to square one.  If you wonder of much stress you can take or are a masochist you should try this. But my time is done. Help yourself, this game is F2P after all.
9547	0	a	New publisher buys rights to beloved indie game and saturates it with pay2win. Stay clear of this it is not worth your time.
9548	0	a	It is not a classic RPG: If you die, you will loose everything and start from 0 again. I don't like that :-(
9549	0	a	Not a pay free friendly game, character resets after 1 death. More stressful than League of Legends, bad interface and a lack of customizations, not reccommended to play.
9550	0	a	its pay to play the 1st stage of your character is free but when you level up to get to the 2nd stage character for ex. Warrior[free] /Bandit[600 coins] its not right especially for a game like this pay to play for everything even changing characters or characters name now i know alot of....well a few of people hate negative reviews but when i look at em i see whats wrong with the game so far i found no glitch or anything just its pay 2 play so if you wanna pay for everything forever using your steam bucks this is the game you would want, enjoy o .ob
9551	0	a	this game was great when it came out, but since Kabam took over, its gone downhill fast. would not recomend at this point. my argument would have been different early last year, but as of now, i cannot reccomend it
9552	0	a	This used to be good.
9553	0	a	I don't like this game because I hate everything.
9554	0	a	This was my fav game but then out of no where it turned into pay to win. When that happened RIP rotmg. Another reson its a waste of time you workm for somethin like 8/8 then you die... rage. you loose all that time
9555	0	a	First of all, i loved the idea. However, i have changed my opinion of the game after realizing that i could not communicate in chat. i logged in with the version i downloaded from Steam. i attempted to trade some early items i found, but it told me i could not use the chat.   the thing that made me stop playing this almost immediately was that you cannot sell items you pick up. you can only get gold by paying for it. i wouldnt mind but without being allowed to use the chat, there's is literally no reason to pick up items besides the ones you need. this made the game boring for me
9556	0	a	use to play this game on the website. went up to white start then weekly top. then kabaam bought it and ruined everything. then it became a pay to win. its pretty bad now. dont play it.
9557	0	a	PAY TO WIN GAME SUX!!!!
9558	0	a	I used to play RotMG before Kabam bought it. It used to be good and you used to grind for items. NOW, it's just a cash-grabbing and gambling kind of game. Support is also non-existent, and no actual efforts to remove the bot-spams in-game.  DEAD GAME.
9559	0	a	Used to be fun.
9560	0	a	More ♥♥♥♥ than learning to speak Sweden. Dont Download. This game doesnt even deserve to get uninstalled from history.
9561	0	a	I love how broken the keys are
9562	0	a	I hate this game, but when im bored it's not that bad.
9563	0	a	Sorry this game is cool and all but its not fun when u see players with cool gear and skins and u know they spent their cash for it, i want to see the game that u cant spend ur irl money for the most op gear in the game. I would call it cheating, but i have nothing against money spenders it is ur money and i cant stop them from using it but please, please tell me how is it fun to own everything but u cant even use it because u already finished the game without hard work? I still play the game cause it's cool but, im just sad people pay to win.
9564	0	a	What happend? I used to play on the broswer, back when. Had fun, made freinds, died. Then the game wouldn't play. Few mounths I found it on steam. I was hyped and finished the tutorial in quickie. Then the plauge hit. There are scams everwhere. TPTPTPs every second. Then The Nexus. Bot is the only thing. Noone chills there. R.I.P RotMG
9565	0	a	realm of mad god is good but when i die i lost all of my stuff and whet back to level 1 i hop they can help this i am still playing the game because it is a good mmo
9566	0	a	Pay to win, no depth or substance.
9567	0	a	dc evry few minz
9568	0	a	This game was 1 of the best games back then but now its just pay to win a time waster dont even install it to play it trust me. From one of the best games to one of the worst a story with a sad ending :((( .
9569	0	a	DO NOT PLAY. IT WAS AMAZING BEFORE THEY RUINED IT WITH PAY TO WIN
9570	0	a	Now, i'd like to rate this a 10/10, but this is 100% pay to win, so i'd give a 7.5/10 because of the in app purchases. other than that it's a great game
9571	0	a	when i first played this game i think this game is amazing, but you need alot of cash to play this game (P2W).  I think you need to rob a bank dude my advice? NOT RECOMMEND
9572	0	a	i love this game but kabam ruien it and now we r left witrh the most stuiped mmo
9573	0	a	Played the game for a little bit... died by a pirate... lost everything in my inv... (Which was only a bow :(
9574	0	a	This game is bad. I really don't anything about it. THe combat, the drop system, or really anything. It isn't very co-op friendly either.
9575	0	a	On par with a flash game you'll find on newgrounds.
9576	0	a	SUCKS TOO LAGGY
9577	0	a	Yes, almost all free to play games are going to need some sort of micro-transaction to compensate for development, but this game is just ridiculous. In order to do most anything in game, you need to spend a decent chunk of cash compared to what you would pay for this type of game. Could be a fun game otherwise, but they just got too greedy.
9578	0	a	ok so let me start of with this game is a good bullet hell shooter. Its simple fun and easy to play. now with that aside this game has gone down the toilet.back in 2012 i was new to this game and i simply loved it. it was my first online game to play and i played almost everyday. It was fun learning all the tricks to leveling up a character with potions and high level gear which made it very enjoyable. Thats until kabam started shatting on this game. First of all they take out the items known as amulets of ressurection. They basically let you escape fromd eath and keep all your items with teh price of the amulet breaking. many pros and players used these to make sure they dont lose there high level gear. Than kabam removed these entirely. That means everyone would die and lose all there stuff. Than the reason appeared. Before gear was a monster drop only thing but than they started selling them in the nexus. now let me show you how dumb this is. 1 piece of high gear is 950 gold atleast. now take the price of gold which is 5-10 bucks atleast than times that by the number of equipment slots. Yeah this game is no longer fun to play at all due to the myriad of pay to play stuff there putting into this game. over all this game is dead and i would stay away. Many youtubers who used to play dont even upload this game because they know its down the hole. RIP ROTMG 2012-2013(in my timeline anyways).
9579	0	a	why the game did not work i downloaded it when i open it loads when it reach 100 it just stay loading
9580	0	a	How a developer would think to ask money for this travesty is unfathomable. The horrors begin with the main menu, where you discover that the mouse cursor and mouselook are simultaneously active, so that when you choose one of Air Control's modes, you also move the camera around. The background shot is of an underwater airplane, above which sits the game's title in a blurry font. That title doesn't sit in the interface, however. No--it simply sits above the aircraft as though the letters exist within the game's own world. Clearly, something's amiss, and if the main menu isn't enough to convince you, then the abominable zombie-human-dwarf cutscene that opens Casual Mode certainly should be.  The mess that follows is homely, unfinished, and inept. By default, an inexplicable array of buttons labeled 'lock cursor' are strewn across the screen. You can remove them by clicking the 'disable [lockcursor] UI' button at the top left, though that particular button needlessly remains in all its unsightliness. Remember: any cursor movement is accompanied by complementary mouselook, so interacting with the interface causes the camera to move wildly about. In this case, it's an airplane interior that dizzily rotates around you as you turn off the interface and guess at what your goal is. As it turns out, you're a flight attendant, and the big red sentient exclamation mark at the rear of the plane has a task for you: deliver some coffee to a passenger in the front.  Your next task is to pick pillows up from the floor, which means moving the mouse cursor over them and clicking them, a rather uncomfortable task if the mouse cursor has moved to the edge of the screen, as it just may have by this point. And so you point and click on the pillows, which simultaneously changes your point of view so that you're facing the passengers to the left. You might try to hit the escape key and try to restart the level, or abandon this rubbish altogether for a different mode, but doing so in any of the game's modes causes the mouselook and movement keys to stop functioning, and in some cases renders the level entirely inoperable.  Casual Mode plays out in a series of bizarre levels, most of them only a few seconds long, that have you moving from the back of the plane to the cockpit (yes, that's it), picking up a gun and shooting a terrorist, picking up trash bags, or performing some other mundane task. Every one of these activities is awful. Passengers sit in a catatonic state with their arms held stiffly in place. Terrorists don't move or animate in any way, and explode when they die. Sometimes there are weird colored cubes on the floor for no reason. In one ludicrous level, there's no gravity, and the game displays only a few frames per second. And every nonsensical task is accompanied by peculiar descriptions written in broken English. 'You need to find reason while airplane fell down' says one dialogue window, right before you discover that ending the mission requires… opening a door. 'You can open your inventory with a button situated in left' says another, even though there is no inventory button, on the left or anywhere, and the mission gives you no reason to have one.  You also get to be a mechanic, which means hovering over some buttons until one turns red and you click on it. More often, you get to be a pilot, both in Casual Mode and in Killjoy Mode, but piloting an aircraft in Air Control is a farce: the controls make no sense, the camera angles make no sense, and if you crash, you have to quit out of the game and restart it due to the aforementioned broken menu options. Crashing into the sea is particularly fascinating, as the water is actually a solid object; how the aircraft in the main menu managed to sink is a mystery.  You shouldn't forget Realistic Mode, in which you walk around in an airplane cabin filled with petrified character models while cursing the ridiculously low frame rate, and then do nothing because that's all you do in this mode. To be fair, though, doing nothing is preferable than wasting your time on this wreck, which advertises itself on Steam as 'the best flight simulation in the history of computer games' and promises that it is 'the first airplane game, where plane compartment is visible.' Both of these claims are lies, of course, which only makes sense for a broken scam masquerading as a computer game.
9581	0	a	Played 4 years ago got to lvl 13, lame gamplay.
9582	0	a	Looks like the issue where you can't fullscreen otherwise the game becomes unplayable still isn't fixed. It's been over a year since I played this, I would have thought they might have figured out a game breaking bug since then!
9583	0	a	yea... its worth a try because it takes like 20 secs to download, but its extreamly repetative, Its got the quality of a phone game... but most of all... its pay to win. Dont expect to do anything if you dont want to pay... but i dont see why you would. This game wast fun after the first 20 mins.
9584	0	a	big no! its better to play HappyWars Than this Pay2Win   if you want to achieve all all you need is to pay and not only you need to pay because its kinda sucks whenever you die in the game your stat will reset then what about the premium items you bought? imean when you die those premium/real money items you bought in this game will be going trash its better to play like HappyWars or FreetoPlay there's alot of f2p in the steam dont waste your time in this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ pure p2w
9585	0	a	Pay to win
9586	0	a	Boring, I used to play this 2 years ago back when wildshadow ( something like that ) owned the game. The game then was not milked and droopy like a 4 year old cow after the farmer's just lost a child, and then Kabam ( tm or some ♥♥♥♥ ) came and ruined everything by bringing in these fancy package deals. 10/10 would not play. My friends would waste money on this basic game.
9587	0	a	sucks
9588	0	a	Can't rebind keys=not so good.
9589	0	a	Saw that it was a F2P and decided to check it out. Upon start up, I was reminded of the RPG's of old which didn't have much in the way of graphics; which I thought was cool. However, about 10 minutes into the game, a popup blocked my screen asking me to buy the starter kit of $20 and I couldn't close it out. I can understand them wanting to get the players to buy the game, but.........10 minutes in????? The game had potential, but the early greed ruined it. Don't even see why they have it as free to play. More like a 10 min demo.  I quickly uninstalled the game and decided to write my first review. Sucks that it's a negative comment. :(
9590	0	a	This game is funny when you start it but you will soon realise that two choices comes : you can pay it and don't loose too much or don't pay it and you will loose all and realise that it will be really long to be a good player in this game.
9591	0	a	♥♥♥♥ this ♥♥♥♥
9592	0	a	I know i haven't played much here but on kong I have. This game will make you grind when you get higher levels if you dont pay for it. Its fun at first or with friends, but alone dont get it.
9593	0	a	Oh Wild Shadow Studios... *sniff* You will be missed...              And another thing, Kabam: You're. Ugly.
9594	0	a	Resolution is fixed now.The only annyoing thing now that the devs have to update is the controls.If you controls your character he often goes to far.
9595	0	a	This honestly used to be really fun. (I use to play on the internet not via steam so excuse the hours), but I came back to see how it is now and wow. It is so much money based, the company who got a hold of this ruined this.
9596	0	a	Why do we even have this game on earth.
9597	0	a	Definitely one of the best F2P games I've ever played.  Or so it used to be.
9598	0	a	2 words. Horrible Game. When you die you lose your character. Now who would want that. Theres only 1 class that you start with and it takes multiple characters to unlock all of the classes. The graphics are corny and the gameplay does not make up for it. Theres no story line and you randomly fight gods (which should be immortal). It is almost impossible to find weapons for your class. Most of the weapons or armor for classes that are hard to unlock. I really hate this game and i would suggest playing pac-man (which would be way more fun).   0.5/10
9599	0	a	Its good but its got worse because you have to basicly buy everything now!
9600	0	a	You waste money on it and Dieeee. Yay so fun =/
9601	0	a	I have no ♥♥♥♥ing idea what I'm doing...
9602	0	a	Laggy bullethell game which is extremly limited by the fact you have to pay money if you want to keep your progress.
9603	0	a	cute. but also a headach :/
9604	0	a	The Realm of the mad god is juts a rage game who is like WOW but in a pixelated world and when you die your character dies so i dont like this game i played it a while on my friends computer then i died so basicly 2 hours of nothin but sure it may be fun if you make a speedrun or a co op on it then it maybe fun but i didnt like it
9605	0	a	yes and no kbam is too freakin greedy and they removed ammys and all these freakin reskins!

9607	0	a	This game was one that intrested me on first glance. But, then i realized that it was a game that is basically Pay to Win. It was very dissapointing in general.
9608	0	a	♥♥♥♥ this ♥♥♥♥
9609	0	a	Basicly its Pay2Win. If you dont pay you're the weakest.
9610	0	a	COD IS BETTER!!!!!!!!!!1!111 1337 PRO MLG
9611	0	a	If they spent their time updating the game play for everyone instead of just offering pets that 2 year old get their mom to paay for the game would be good
9612	0	a	Kabam ruined this game once they bought it for many reasons,   1. You have to buy gold with real money to buy almost everything and when you die you lose them so it isnt worth it and it made more sense when wildshadow studios owned it because there wasnt everything to pay for, I still continued loving this game after and played it alot. 2. It is very buggy now, You cant even log in or merge your account with another one or even make this public because many buttons dont work and now it forces you to log in now and i cant even play (I wasted $20 on this game) 3. It doesnt have that same arcade like game anymore 4. Everyone is more quiet and the game isnt very enjoyable it used to be my favorite 5. Kabam has useless support. I emailed them to fix the problems above many times they never reply and are too lazy to care about this game.
9613	0	a	This game is so boring aNI hate it DO NOT recommend this to anyone, although WHAT CAN YOYU EXPECT FOR A GAME THAT IS ONLY 16MB....
9614	0	a	♥♥♥♥ this game and it's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t
9615	0	a	It was great once upon a time but one major draw back to this game is that the developers don't actually care about keeping the game fair and allowing duping and hacking to go on. Personally I found the game fun for a while but with no viable endgame and the constant devaluation of your time by hackers its worthless now
9616	0	a	great game but needs best prices like baby tiny dragon egg for 40 coins or make a area where you can get a egg and food for pet
9617	0	a	Boring, lame, and begs for money.  Don't waste your time with this game.
9618	0	a	I immediately quit after the tutorial. The concept is cool, but they don't really tell you how to move through the world in order to become stronger through leveling and equipment. Just seems like they want your money and give you very little in return, if anything. Not worth downloading.
9619	0	a	this game sucks and i hate it and i dont know why i keep playing it
9620	0	a	Don't touch this game
9621	0	a	Played this game when i was about 9-10. This game was not bad back a while ago. But it's changed, It's really changed.
9622	0	a	Decided to download this because of fond memories of playing it back in the browser days thinking that the steam version would add new features and be more streamline. Instead upon completing the tutorial I'm greeted by a gold merchent and a constant barrage of microtransactions. It doesn't help that there was barely anyone even on and the fact that the servers were lagged to hell.  It's ashame cause I remember it being a rather enjoyable game. No I do not recommend this to anyone.
9623	0	a	Cool, but a little boring.
9624	0	a	I have wasted many hours and many dollars in this perma-death game. Although it can get rather addictive and fun, everytime you die it just reminds you of how terrible the game actually is. There really isnt any point in this game except to get to level 20, find some horribly designed weapons, kill pixelated monsters that drop blue bags that contain stange drinks, drink the drinks, become stronger, spend hours killing things and getting 'fame' which only puts up your rank once a certain amount has been reached, then either decide to suicide or just get killed by a stupid pixel that throws smaller pixels at you.  After my many hours in this pixelated world, I overall think it is a terrible game completely due to the fact its perma-death. However if ,somehow, this game was re-created or even updated to be a game in which after dying, you simply re-spawn, I would enjoy it much more and even spread the games title. Although im not sure how they would pull this off, possibly once you die you simply re-spawn at a lower level?   So if your a billonaire with thousands to stick up yer ♥♥♥ and no life at all, go ahead and play this stupid enraging ♥♥♥♥.  Also I think of this game as ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥ shit, so i conclude my description of this terrible game. Have a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ day! :D
9625	0	a	I saw this game and said 'What a cool RPG' then i saw how they practically begged you for money and that all i get is people harrassing me when i get somthing finally good. All they do is send trade invites and it's really annoying. I'd play this game if they let you aquire all the in game stuff without pay.. such as Warframes does. Paying is an option but faster and not that overpowered. Oh and the account naming system sucks. No spaces and its limited text. Hell I was about to just put down somthing random because every name i tried was taken... you might as well look at the back of an Xbox gift card and use only the Letters in it for your name.... That way your garunteed Your name. I'm pretty sure no one wants XbvCUoF for there account name. Feel free to use that by that way. It's probably not taken yet.
9626	0	a	Since Kabam's acquisition, the game has gone downhill due to excessive monetization. If that does not bother you, make sure that your internet connection is stable when playing.
9627	0	a	This game used to be very fun.. but then KABAM, this game got ruined... P2w, do not waste time in this game.. (See what i did there)
9628	0	a	Not my cup of tea.... I don't like tea.  NEXT!

9630	0	a	Ahh, Realm of the Mad God, truly you are one of the most chaotic games out there, there can be so much ♥♥♥♥ on the screen at once that you truly deserve the title of a Bullet-hell MMO, you were an incredibly fun game when I last played you but have apparently been ruined by greedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and turned into a pay-to-win game. Don't play pay-to-win games because only ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s make those types of games.
9631	0	a	Dreadful.. Just crashes for me even after a few reinstalls.
9632	0	a	It was one of the good games that all played but suddenly other developer bought it and destroyed i heard this story many times 
9633	0	a	uhhhhhhhhhhhh o.o.. addicting but.....hard..warning only way to be happy in this game is to buy stuff with real money!!

9644	0	a	This game is really fun but addicting. After you get good at it you don't want to do anything else. It is a huge temptation to play but I don't want to become addicted again.
9645	0	a	terrible graphics, terrible gameplay and options, terrible comtrolls, terrible UI, terrible game overall
9646	0	a	Worst game I have ever played, controls are terrible, its a pay to win game basically.
9647	0	a	Though fun at first, RooMG quickly turns into a long winded grind fest of dodging bullets and shooting; only made worse by overly obnoxious in-your-face pay-to-win mechanics, style-less graphics, and dodgy UI problems that shouldn't even exist in a game that costs so much to play effectively.  Give it a pass.
9648	0	a	There is a point where a pay to win game becomes a Pay-to-Progress game. This is just that. You start with one character and you can only get to level 20 which takes almost no time at all. The game is not something I would ever consider playing unless you were just bored one day and wanted to poke at something new for a few minutes.  It sucks too because let me tell ya, this game had potential to keep my attention.
9649	0	a	This game WAS the funnest game i have ever played BUT! Kabam took over Realm Of The Mad god and destroyed it. How you ask? Well there was items you could buy with real money and in game money but kabam took away the power to buy items with in game money and increasced the items that you need to buy to win and although it was always permanet death dying now is 10 times as worse becuase the items you die with them it is real life money you are losing.
9650	0	a	Spent around $30 on this game in items only to find out they are permanently lost on death. Fun to play but i suggest you keep your wallet shut for this one. Enjoy it as a free game but the developers went too far on the Roguestyle gameplay when real cash is involved. Avoid.
9651	0	a	'Game gave me cancer, but I couldnt cure myself cause i had to spend all my savings into this game not to die every 10 sec.'  These were Sciarpa's last words before he died. I suggest none of you buys this game if you wish not to end up like him. Sciarpa's Mom. 
9652	0	a	F#ck this game this game it's not that good even though you want a good weapon you never get it even if you play for two years you never get it.
9653	0	a	pay to win 11/10-ign
9654	0	a	Realm of the Mad God is not what it used to be anymore. After Kabam bought it from Wildshadow, the game quickly became a pay to win, rare items became untradeable and many old players coming back to the game would come back to find that their items have gone down in price dramatically (possibly because of a duplication glitch earlier in the game). On top of all this, the drop chance of these very rare items was increased by a large amount removing a sense of achievement when obtaning one.. In terms of pay to win, all of the best gear can be purchased from the Wildshadow shops.  For gameplay though it is what it says on the tin its a permadeath bullet dodger which is still fun to play even for new people just discovering the genre or older players returning to this game. If you play games for acheivement, this game isn't really for you as there is very little reward anymore for fully gearing your character (which could take weeks).
9655	0	a	i hate this game i dont know why i bothered to play this game at all i do not recommend this game at all if you want a good free game to play that not pay to win i highley suggest unturned
9656	0	a	it is boring and stupied
9657	0	a	It sucks money out of people!
9658	0	a	I have recently gone back to this game with friends and i can only stand about 30 minutes before i just get bored. I go on my level 20 knight ready for adventure, fun and loot but i am greeted with a world the feels empty now. I am going to be one of those people who said the game was better when Wild Shadow ran it. I look back at all my hours on the steam version and the kongreate version and think of how many times i would rage but get over it and roll a new character. It makes me sad inside. It was fine the way it was going but i don't understand why Kabam had to put in MicroTransactions.... I personally made the mistake of putting money into this game once and i lose it by some 8/8 dragging mobs everywhere (my fault i know) but it made me think. I wasn't mad that i lost the gear. I was mad because i didn't earn that gear i just clicked a button... This is what ruined this game the most for me. I know i am probably going to come back to this game from time to time but it will never be the same. At one point only one of my friends were playing and they had all played 200 hours.... I was the first to quit and it still annoys me. One of my greatest memories were me and my friends would meet up in the guild hall that we spend way to long in and open up a Candy Land. Respawnable Bosses and the shot at the rare Candy Coated Armor... We were drooling over this amazing piece of armor and we ran this dungeon hours upon hours non stop. That was one of the best memories.. I never got cc armor in the end but still. The best part. but now you rarely see my friends having fun in this game. They go in. Farm for 2-3 hours or more and then slowly all quit to play the next day. We still laugh occasionaly but when were all levely it feels like a drag.... To put it better it feels like a chore. In the end we just get a level 20 to power level us and still then we don't have any fun.... It brought many friends together and now we just don't meet up to play a game anymore...  This game just wont cut it anymore and i will only log on every now and then untill i lose my next character but then i think im done.. This game feels slow and boring. Sorry Kabam but you have let us down.  (I know you probably wont even read this rant)
9659	0	a	Game would be sweet if you didn't lag so hard when there was 20+ chars on screen. Super fun until 'end game' where there is tons of players trying to get their damage in on the boss and you lag, losing your char to death, or not being able to target boss with damage so you don't get loot.
9660	0	a	Kabam makes everything pay to win and then takes out ways to come back to life after dieing (rings) 11/10
9661	0	a	play this game, max you character. put money in now that your far. die. lose everything. quit the game, because you literally wasted hours and money into a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥ game that is worth nothing to you once you die. ♥♥♥♥ this game. In the ♥♥♥. Rage inducing, waste of money, piece of ♥♥♥♥. It's not like other games where you die and respawn. no no no. you pay money into a game that you literally will lose all of the ♥♥♥♥ in the game. lol. ♥♥♥♥ that.
9662	0	a	Was a good game until Kabam bought it.
9663	0	a	Overall, very shallow and lacks a lot of depth. The majority of the gameplay is a perpetual state of griding, so that you can get good stuff, so that you can grind dungeons, so that you can get good stuff, so that you can grind even bigger dungeons... and so on and so forth.  Might be a fun choice to pass the time but I wouldn't reccomend it to people looking for a solid MMO experience.
9664	0	a	NOT WORKING
9665	0	a	It was good before but now its crap
9666	0	a	I do not recommend this game as you will lose your mind trying to get that one more peice of loot and then you die and wham bam thank you ma'am you have just lost it all and this rogue like is beyond stupid and plus 90% of the community are hackers/notifiers that if you do get good enough will steal events from under you
9667	0	a	I have a lot of hours, had a few 8/8's, died, then rage quit.
9668	0	a	what happened??
9669	0	a	Fun, till Kabam came and ruind it.. WHY!?!
9670	0	a	Cons: &gt;p2w &gt;can't import my web account anymore &gt;kabam &gt;lagspike  Pros: &gt;  is fun and rewarding 
9671	0	a	My game keeps turning grey and i am unable to click anything. So annoyed as all my friends love it :(
9672	0	a	I pray that Kabam someday realizes when enough is enough and takes out the p2w feel. Just make things cost exp like before and even spap on a 10$ price tag if you want and THEN i might recomend it... Just realize that there used to be a great game here until money was brought into the equation.
9673	0	a	RotMG was more fun before Kabam happened. Although pets and the such are a fun addition to the game, everything else just... sucks. This F2P game has been degenerated into a P2W game; quite sad really. What I really wanna emphasize is the ridiculous amount of lag. Some of you guys might not be lagging, others (like me) are lagging as if there was no tomorrow. Thanks Kabam, you made one of my favorite games into a fresh pile of dung.
9674	0	a	I reccomend this to people willing to spend a ton of money on items such as weapons and gold. Its free to play, but certainly not free to win. Nonetheless, it is at least reasonably playable without paying. But you have to be willing to grind for hours to get a weapon one tenth the power of a weapon you could have just ruined your credit for. Expect also endless spammers in the lobby (nexus, the safe zone) BLARING IN ALL CAPS 'SOME RANDOM WEAPON ONLY $11.99!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!' nonstop. Overall, if you just want a simple time waster, I reccomend, but otherwise, stay away from this game like it was a beehive with bees who had aids put on their stings.
9675	0	a	The game is fun, the permadeaths are not.
9676	0	a	fun game but lags a lot for a 2 bit game i do not recommend this game on steam use the web browser 
9677	0	a	4/10 doesnt work half the time
9678	0	a	Terrible game pay to play I liked it better when you could get the chicken wing... Let me be honest i only played this game for the chicken wing... And the koolaid... Man i love chicken and koolaid... But yeah bad game no more chicken
9679	0	a	Do you want to have fun? Don't play this game. Do you want head-aches? Play on!  How to have fun.  Step 1 : spend alot of money on character slots and chests. Step 2 : Get good items Step 3 : Die and quit
9680	0	a	Very bad game now, can't log into my account. Would not play again till the owner fix this problem!
9681	0	a	It could have better graphics, the worlds are NOT private and everyone is there, making users with not so great computers lag out and crash... awful graphics the gameplay is good but extremely repetitive when you die you restart your character
9682	0	a	Waist of 11 minutes of my life
9683	0	a	Used to be good, now just a pay to win
9684	0	a	This Game sucks after Kabem took it over 
9685	0	a	it is boring and stupied
9686	0	a	What happen to this game??? its turning into a pay to win type of game now -_-
9687	0	a	The game is not even fun ;p and its all about surviving
9688	0	a	Pay to die, get frustated and trolled ...
9689	0	a	I came back into playing this game after leaving in 2013, not long after to see that it has turned into a lagging mess (not fps lag, server lag) whether I play this game on its website, or just on a client off Steam, yes I didn't play this game on Steam because of the #1 obvious reason why, I can't import my other account, it's like impossible. Anyway getting back to the bad part of the game, it is a lagging horror... I can't kill anything because the lag has to catch up to see how much damage I did to the enemy. Also when I'm just randomly doing a dungeon I get kicked after 15 seconds of being there, for no reason... After getting so far in the dungeon and then getting kicked to just log back onto the hub.  When looking on the map I see an enemy right in front of me... 'There isn't anything there,' I say to myself, but wait there's more... It doesn't appear until I kill everything around it, not knowing what the enemy was, thirty seconds later, I die, seeing my health drop instantly after 30 seconds from God knows what.  Now for the natural flaws, Realm of the Mad God is a Bullet Hell Massively Multiplayer Online Game, once you die, your stuff is gone, whatever you are carrying and even all your stats. There are scammers on every single server trying to get you to pay for in game items for real currency, which is no different then buying items period. (YOU STILL HAVE TO PAY REAL CURRENCY FOR FAKE ITEMS) If your account gets hacked there is no way to contact anyone to retrieve it, which is the same reason why in a Guild you cannot change the Guild Master.  If you made an account off steam with an email you no longer use then too bad, you cannot change this either nor can you change your password, this game has so many problems since it's first release that no matter how long you wait for a new update nothing will be fixed.  TL;DR: The problems I'm referring to got more severe after... 'Kabam.'
9690	0	a	i've put around 100hours into this a long time ago(prob more) and all i can say is  HAY KABAM DID YOU ♥♥♥♥ UP THIS GAME THAT MUCH THE PEOPLE OF R.O.T.M.G LEFT?   really great game till people like kabam come along and take away what was free and sell it back to the people for a stupid price and best thing of all the people don't get to keep it forever.
9691	0	a	This Game is fun but, There is nothin new, so much scammers, kinda a pay-to-win game, And Honestly Boring Becasue of 0 New Content (Big Content Not like re-skins), I would love that keys were tradalbe or i wouldnt have gotten scammed so many times. IN all a fun game if u have the time and money to pay (Which i Dislike)
9692	0	a	This is horrible. The controls are are awful, i keep moving in a direction even though i've let go of that key and holding down the key to go in the opposite direction. im pretty sure the chat gave me cancer, and if i listed off all the things this game did bad we would be here all day. (and i'd run out of space) Basically what im trying to say here is, save your self the brain cells and skip over this one.
9693	0	a	This game is 50MB and it's still a waste of my storage.
9694	0	a	NO THIS ♥♥♥♥ING GAME WILL MAKE YOU RAGE NON MATTER WHAT!
9695	0	a	the game is pretty fun, but the perma death is the worse because you lose all your hard earned items.
9696	0	a	Time waster. That's it.
9697	0	a	My first negative review, ok well here we go.  Now don't get me wrong, if you like it, then great! It has a lot of promise to it, but it falls short. It has pay to win tactics, it sometimes has performance issues when there are a lot of enemies around (It may just be me, but I have a pretty strong computer). And it gets stale after a while. It just gets too boring to play because of all the repetative dungeons and the fighting gets old. Great I got to level 20, now I get to restart, or kill enemies for fun, until I get warped to the final boss. And speaking of the final boss, wow, just wow. Everyone on the server gets teleported. 'Im sorry, did you want to kill the final boss, well these hundreds of people want to also, so get in line buddy.' This is a great game for about the first hour or two, and I've played EIGHTEEN HOURS of it, just showing it to friends and watching them also get very bored. It deserves to be free, and if one day they start charging money for it, don't get it.
9698	0	a	cant even play 0/10 bots
9699	0	a	this reminds me of what runecape did in 2008 they ruined a wonderful game... you guys need to learn from their misakes and do what they did bring back the game that everyone loved.... then you'll start making good money on the game again instead of trying to force people to pay for items.....
9700	0	a	its soooooooooooooo glitchy i cant login to it after it had an error
9701	0	a	Played it once like two years ago. decent little game.  Revisit it. Eye ♥♥♥♥ed by 'Give us your money.'   Game won't load me in, giving me a repeating error message.  Will never look at again.
9702	0	a	Good game , except that the server is responding slowly .. :(
9703	0	a	♥♥♥♥ this game
9704	0	a	don't get me wrong Realm of the Mad God is an ok game and all but the lag is absolutly unbelievble. I played for as long as I could before I came to a conclusion that I can not stand half of what was going on.
9705	0	a	PAY2WIN! Please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please do NOT play this!!! It used to be good... then... HACKERS EVERYWHERE! BAD COMMUNITY! CHATBOTS IN NEXUS! again... PAY2WIN! WASTE OF TIME!  -------------------------------------------  anyway... thanks for reading! :)
9706	0	a	P2W, used to be good game now sucks
9707	0	a	Like all the free games on here, you can't progress without spending money.
9708	0	a	Used to be an amazing game idk what happened :/
9709	0	a	This game used to be a gem, but has been turned into a really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ring.  If you dish out 400-500$ you'll be the 'proud' owner of a pet that both heals you and replenishes your mana at stupidly high rates. Then when you feel like an unbeatable force, with your op pet, you run around the map untill you lagspike and die.  4/10 not recommended. 
9710	0	a	Thanks Kabam You Ruined It.
9711	0	a	Hoboy. Story begin: I played this years ago. Before it was on Kongregate, or Steam, just a standalone website with an embedded online flash game. Yup, I'm a veteran. 8/8 necro before pets. 5/6 pally, killed by Cube God. Look me up on realmeye. My username is Levelworld. The game was fantastic. Skill, equipment management, and teamwork were all a part of it. Dungeons were challenging and exciting, bosses were over the top, and don't get me started on tombs... Now, it's a grindfest with everyone crossing their fingers for loot. It's sad to see such a great game fall in a couple of (and I use this term loosely) 'patches'. Enough backstory, let's get to the pros/cons: Pros: + Nice 8 bit artstyle + Lots of items... I gues... + uh... class system? + a boss or two + dungeons... . yeah, there really isn't much to this game (that's fun now anyways...) Cons: - Heavily (and I mean it) Heavily Pay 2 Win - Pay $1000 for something that will fully heal you in 4~5 seconds - Notifiers. Skull Shrine just spawn in a realm? Two seconds later, the realm is full. - Bad community - Imbalanced gameplay - Nothing is hard anymore - Nothing is a challenge - did I mention the difficuly? - devs are too lazy to fix any glitches (except the ones that will make them lose $$$) - R.I.P. ROTmg  Conclusion: Don't spend your money on it, just play it for a little while. (I still play it occasionally, but only when my (heavily conditioned ;P) friend is on) I wish I could give this a better review, but it just... sucks now... Invent a time travel machine for me pls.  Wait, this is reccommended by EC!? Extra Credits?!?! Better check this...oh, it's before Kabam. Good. Don't listen to the good reviews, they're pre-kabam. Co-op play? More like, 'oh hey you rush, we'll sit here until you reach the boss and steal the loot'. I will admit, this game had its issues before kabam. But it certainly has more issues now.
9712	0	a	ITS CRUD. it only lets you play around in tge shops and the main hub. i thought it was a proper game 
9713	0	a	Look at my play time. Look deep into it. Look at how short my play time is. That is how unbearable this game is.  [The start] I boot up the game, I read a few revies but thought that maybe they were overexaggerating, the first thing i see is half the page dedicated DIRECTLY TO SELLING YOU ITEMS I ignore this and create my character. I encounter the first mini boss in the tutorial, it took way too long due to the CRIPPLING MOVEMENT LAG. That is right. Most of my play time was from waiting for my character to stop flailing his ♥♥♥ around so i could attempt to hit an enemy, even then it shot everywhere but where i aimed! I went to the nexus to attempt to g- OH DEAR OG THE FRICKIN BOTS you have no idea the chat was covering 1/3 of my screen because of the bot spam. I exited the game and i am going to uninstall it. It's a waste of good data space.
9714	0	a	the servers are soooo laggy if you hold on to a move key for to long it will stay going that direction for a long time before you can gain controll of it. and the game has no storyline and people who just barely start playing have no clue what to do or how to do it
9715	0	a	Kabam made this game so bad I masturbated all day,
9716	0	a	This game sucks.
9717	0	a	What happend? I used to play on the broswer, back when. Had fun, made freinds, died. Then the game wouldn't play. Few mounths I found it on steam. I was hyped and finished the tutorial in quickie. Then the plauge hit. There are scams everwhere. TPTPTPs every second. Then The Nexus. Bot is the only thing. Noone chills there. R.I.P RotMG
9718	0	a	im so glad that we have another online game where you have to pay to be good at the game, and its not as cool as the pics let on unless you have to pay for that too.
9719	0	a	it sucks
9720	0	a	wont work it says loading version error 
9721	0	a	This game has serious potential, and a great in game economy. That is if you can get past the ♥♥♥♥ development and Moderation status of the game. Not to mention the game is 100% pay to win. Microtransactions literally crawling up every oraphus.  ++I like the game and all the ideas++ -- The people who run the game now are ♥♥♥♥-- 
9722	0	a	What can i say about this game. I CAN SAY A LOT. Sure when i downloaded this game i expected better game engines and core gameplay to be good as the graphics were 8 bit. but wholy crap even FLAPPY BIRD has a better engine.  When moving and shooting you would expect for this to worth in clear interactions, thats where you're wrong  Whenever you move or shoot your attack ( everybody is ranged even the knight with the sword like WDF) It pretty much sets up a queue for you to do this, Now you're like 'Hold on tavros that cant be that bad' The porblem is in a game that every monster is moving realy fast and has over 9001 health some problems come up.  Its like your playing diner dash with this dam movement. Actually diner dash probably has better gaming mechanics in it. I get it that its a free game but this game is unplayable as well as you cant get out of spawn because theres 10,000 people advertising websites of way better games and how to get 500 million xp in 10 hours if the game worked.   SUMMARY: this game sucks the engine is horrible, the mechanics are worse than diner dash and id rather think of diner dash as a mmorpg instead of this  0/10 great game to uninstall
9723	0	a	The concept is there, but of course greedy companies have to buy out small indie companies and totally ruin a good game  It's like every crapp P2W MMO: You can play it for free but the only way to conveniently progress is by buying crap from the store.  Is it fun? Yes, but the P2W features narrow it down to a boring arcade game unless you're willing to buy a lot of stuff for prices you could use to buy a ton of other games that you'll spend more time on.  Overall, great gameplay, it's just the game is ruined by P2W.
9724	0	a	Everywhere I turn, you need Realm Gold. THIS WAS THE ♥♥♥♥ BACK THEN. THEN YOU RUIN THE GAME BY MAKING IT PAY2WIN? (Edit: I recently reinstalled this game to give it another go. Now the game wont even load.)
9725	0	a	the game froze me in the buy begginer pack window so i cant even continue cuz i am not spending 20$ (theres a sale) on the game. it wont let me hit a red X or anything execpt buy so this game is bad in my mind. if u can tell me how to get rid of the thing under 7 days in my mind i will probably change my review.
9726	0	a	.
9727	0	a	Worst 8-bit game I have ever played, please don't waste your time on even trying this game... Boring Lose all of your items on death Need friends to play with if you even wan't to even have a little fun, so many more games out there that are much better and are free.
9728	0	a	Money money money... must be funny...in a rich man's world.....  the game is pay2win and it ruins the game, don't get it.
9729	0	a	...
9730	0	a	It's aight.
9731	0	a	logging in is a mess, your charecter will walk in a random direction for no reason spamers are everywhere, and the lag is REAL, the GAME is find but get rid of the spamer, fix hackers, and LET ME WALK STRAIGHT!!!!!
9732	0	a	Wrote a review, steam ate it, don't feel like writing it again.  Several maxed characters, multiple UT items and endgame gear, all gained legitimately. Game was genuinely good clean fun with cool people. You cannot comprehend how disheartening it is to log out one day and see most of that ♥♥♥♥ is available in the store against real money, and to have your screen immediately 90% covered with bots spamming cash store ads after you shift through the pop up ads and menus cluttered with 'buy this buy that'. If you ignore the bots, it takes a minute or two for another one to start spamming the chat. You can also buy health and mana on-the-go at any moment with real money.
9733	0	a	As most other reviews state, it was a great browser game that I loved to play and i stopped playing just because i kinda forgot about it. Today I decided look though games that were in my library that I never played a saw this and well... It didn't hold up. I started a new character but, couldn't afford any items because i only had 40 coins to start. Also, the amount of server lag was so unbearable that I had to quit out of the game entirerly. It's a plain and simple pay2win game and I (and most other people) don't like that especially win it wasn't one to begin with. I'm sorry if you didn't get to play before Kabam got to it but, I wouldn't suggest it.
9734	0	a	19 seconds to download 19 seconds of my life wasted
9735	0	a	I cant even play the screen is to little
9736	0	a	Don't ever, ever play this game
9737	0	a	what I don't like about this game is freaking lag and when i stop moving my character it just keeps walking and i die, I mean i had a 6/8 character man.Kabam, fix yo dam game!
9738	0	a	You can't even do anything fun without real money. A game should not advertise 'Free 2 Play' unless it gives a decent experience.
9739	0	a	I used to play RotMG before Kabam bought it. It used to be good and you used to grind for items. NOW, it's just a cash-grabbing and gambling kind of game. Support is also non-existent, and no actual efforts to remove the bot-spams in-game.  DEAD GAME.
9740	0	a	Used to be fun.
9741	0	a	Pay to win
9742	0	a	SUCKS TOO LAGGY
9743	0	a	Well, I really used to enjoy this game until KABAM turned it into a f***ing cash grab. thanks kabam.
9744	0	a	I put way many more hours than what steam says next to my name (I used to play in browser before steam) and it was a helluva game for the time being.  That is of course, until Kabam took over.  In a far far away galaxy when Wild Shadow Studios had control over ROTMG (around 2011 jeez!), the game was a fun time waster where you could level up characters, aquire awesome loot, and just have fun with friends recking bosses. Now it's tuned into every other ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Pay-2-Win MMO out there where the devs (even though they say they care) really don't care about their player base.  The ideas are great, the execution was terrible (on Kabam's part). Many of the mechanics got changed over Kabam's greediness like that fact that you can now BUY the best items in the game (Tier 12 Weapons/Armour) in the main hub for 'gold' (100 gold=$1). So you don't even have to play the game to get good items.  'But Yell0w Waffle, deez newbs who buy weapns frm de start arent skilled like popel who played the gaem!' Aha! This is where permadeath comes in. New players will die constantly either from poor choices or from 'Kabam's Curse of the Lag' and forced to start over again, and Kabam knows this. They are trying to exploit new players into buying better equipment with real money to start the process all over again.  'But Yell0w Waffle, iF I play gaem long enouff w/o spending my mum's $$$ I can get guud wright?' Again, wrong. ROTMG only starts you with 1 character slot (you can BUY 20 or some ♥♥♥♥) and 1 vault (it's like a chest, but can only hold a measly 8 items) and there's no way to get more unless you spend real money. About a year ago Kabam said they would change their business plan and make everything accessible by using the in-game currency (known as 'fame'), but alas, ♥♥♥♥ hasn't changed.  'But Yell0w Waffle, If gaem iz bad why u play fer so lung, why u heff to be mad?' Like I said before, this game is a simple time waster. Honestly, I got really addicted to this game a while back and It was REALLY bad. I feel sorry for all those homework assignments that never got completed because of this game. I even dumped about $40 into this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ (when the game was still fun) but got so frustrated because of the constant lag problems, obvious cheaters (they use special flash players and call themselves 'hackers' lel), and the neverending grind for items when you lose everything.  Realm of the Mad God is like one of those chicks you meet in middle school whose really cool to hang out with, starts to get trashy in high school, and later find out in college that she died because of heroin overdose while her 45 year old 'boy friend' kept her locked in his basement as a... you get the point.In all, ROTMG is a game I cannot recommend, not while Kabam is still in its authority.
9745	0	a	The game is the product of a dev change and a lot of greedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s trying to squeeze and extort as much money from players as possible. The problem with devs of free multiplayer games is that, even though it might not ACTUALLY be greed, charging premiums for exclusive gear or priviledges, even if the cost goes toward server costs or whatever, will never be assumed to do so.   This is a very fun game, especially so if you crave to be treated as a piece of ♥♥♥♥ for playing and supporting the game.
9746	0	a	This game can really mess you up. When you die, you lose EVERYTHING...  I cried
9747	0	a	you spawn in a lobby where you need coins to play games and the coins cost real money... not f2p but pay to play even if the price writen up there is free
9748	0	a	i used to play this game sometimes a while back and it was great. but now since i have windows 10 it doesnt even launch or work at all anymore. fix this issue and then i will give it a good recommendation, but since it desnt work i have to ggive it a no.
9749	0	a	Pay2win, steam users have been getting stuck at the loading screen for months now and absolutely nothing has been done about it. Screen is flooded with ads, chat flooded with bots, paying for character slots, hackers amok, etc.  Gameplay? It's okay, but it lacks difficulty. All in all, not worth putting up with all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.
9750	0	a	I RAGED SO F####N HARD I QUIT THE GAME FOR 1 YEAR and so if you want to rage and lose all your items in the half 25 mins have fun do i recommend this game HELL YUS
9751	0	a	just relaunched it for cards.
9752	0	a	Very unwieldy controls. Didn't get too far into the game because of the controls. It -looks- good, graphics wise. But that is as far as I could go.
9753	0	a	This game is bad. I really don't anything about it. THe combat, the drop system, or really anything. It isn't very co-op friendly either.
9754	0	a	On par with a flash game you'll find on newgrounds.
9755	0	a	bad and terrible game i hate it ruins your life
9756	0	a	Terrible game i know u wont listen to me because i have no playtime almost but started it got bord and stopped. It has been sitting in my list 4 ages only got 10mins get Csgo, Gmod, Arma, DayZ,
9757	0	a	Want to have fun? Well you can't because Kabam ruined it.
9758	0	a	Want to have fun? Well you can't because Kabam ruined it.
9759	0	a	10/10 it's like Call of Duty, without guns.
9760	0	a	with is pixelated graphics annoying musicand lack of tutorial i cant really recommend this game. i give it 6.5/10
9761	0	a	The game wort even load up for me, which really ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off 
9762	0	a	This game has potential of being an extroadinary game with amazing physics and fascinating ways to play! ......if it wasn't for that every server you get onto is full of people spamming the chat with advertisements, overpowered people taking your kills, spending SO MUCH MONEY only for it to get lost because your 'bud' didn't watch your ♥♥♥♥. As much potential I can see for this game, it's a good idea, but the community has ruined it. It was designed to be a team based RPG game, but now it's a rage-inducing, friendship breaking, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ trolling pile of crap. If you have opposite arguments and find the game fun, that's fine, and if you had a different time with the game, that's fine, but for new people, I do not recommend this game. 5/10 Would play for hours
9763	0	a	Overall, very shallow and lacks a lot of depth. The majority of the gameplay is a perpetual state of griding, so that you can get good stuff, so that you can grind dungeons, so that you can get good stuff, so that you can grind even bigger dungeons... and so on and so forth.  Might be a fun choice to pass the time but I wouldn't reccomend it to people looking for a solid MMO experience.
9764	0	a	I don't get the hype. Theres next to no story/plot and the gameplay consists of Holding down a mouse button and running around occassionally 'upgrading items'.  It tries to be unique by having a Fame System based around death, but the very limiting 'gifts' (Single Character slot or $6.50 per extra slot, Single Vault or $5 per extra) you get at the start ruin something that could be fun.  If you had atleast two or three character slots and a larger first Vault (really a chest fro 8 items is a vault?!) it could be interesting as a F2P game.
9765	0	a	Not a fan of my character being wiped every time I die.
9766	0	a	I used to play this game before it came to steam, probably put 100+ hours into it, and it was probably one of the best games I have ever played. Then, Kabam!   If your wondering, Kabam is the company that ruined this game, making it pay-to-win  It's still kinda fun
9767	0	a	I only played the game for about 17 minutes. Ill admit that. But in those 17 minutes, I found that the game was so terrible, walking would lag. I was trying to walk so I wouldn't die, but rather than actually having responsive feedback on screen, it extended each keypress by about 2-4 seconds. I knew it was going to be bad when ANY BUTTON BESIDES THE SERVER BUTTON CRASHED THE GAME, INCLUDING THE PLAY BUTTON, but i at least expect the game to allow me to WALK PROPERLY. I honestly cannot se how this game got popular.
9768	0	a	Don't play this game. Really, don't. I'm not just saying that because it's hard, I like hard games, I like the challenge they provide, but don't play this game. Here's why:  1. The class system. The class system is sh*t. the devs basically just cloned the same class like 15 times. Also, you have to reach a certain level with one class to unlock the next. You have almost no freedom in the 'game'. 87% of the time, you're gonna be a wizard, just because you die all the time.  2. The class system AGAIN. They're all ranged classes. That means there's really no advantage in having different classes, except for the amount of armor you have.  3. The gameplay. There's no 'reward' in this game. Sure, there's loot, but you never really feel like you've achieved anything. It's just 'Hey, you beat literally the baddest motherf***er ever, here's a health potion'.  4. THE GAMEPLAY AGAIN. The 'Quests' are literally just killing the same 'boss' over and over and over and over again. The whole game is just grinding, which is generally viewed as a bad thing in other games.  5. There's not even a storyline, destructable environments, or any variety in environments at all. You just go and kill the 'bosses', which in turn don't provide a satisfying 'fight'. You just shoot them with the same multicolored bolts of energy that are identical within every 'class'. There's not even a change in location to help distract from the shi**y gameplay.  Basically, this whole game is everything bad about legitimate games, and it feels like the devs didn't even do work on it. They just did some crappy 8 bit visuals and stuck in one class and passed it off as like 15. The whole game is sh*t, and the developers are really just huge pieces of sh*t shaped like humans for pretending like they actually worked on this.
9769	0	a	I love this game, alltho I'm terribly bored of it, after doing everything there is to do.  I will also add that this game used to be much better, as you could not buy gear with real cash.  I would not recommend this game.
9770	0	a	It has changed for the worse. Please do something about this oh might one.
9771	0	a	At this point don't even dowload this pile of garbage was kind of fun and had some good ideas, but now well R.I.P. Realm of the Mad God you will forever go down as a game that was mediocre at its peak.
9772	0	a	I WANT 2 HOURS OF MY LIFE BACK TERRIBLE GAME
9773	0	a	relly bad i give it a 1/10 the reaction time is relly bad
9774	0	a	A game with seemingly no purpose. If there were any sort of explanation what so ever I might change my opinion slightly. If you have a friend who plays it though, I'd prolly recommend.
9775	0	a	For the record most people that reviewed haven't played this game long enough to know what the old devs were like. Yes, they weren't 'as greedy' but they still had the class slots for 1000 gold and vaults for 500 gold but they never sold tops and for me the big problem was pets, they are the reason this game isn't fun anymore it doesn't take effort to do anything since you can have a pet that heals you.
9776	0	a	people will murder u very quickly. the bosses are too hard for low lvl starters and u cannot lvl up easily
9777	0	a	Game use to be really good.But then Kabam came in and messed the game up, basically a pay to win now any one with money can get top teir gear with no experience at all.
9778	0	a	I've definetly played longer than this, trust me.... Ok, so let's start off with the positives... - Pretty good ideas - Used to be great - It's F2P - It has a hamburger as a food for a pet and FRENCH FRIES!!! - Different classes - Different specials for each class The disadvantages... - It's P2W, don't believe me? Look at the outragous prices for items that AREN'T PERMANANT. - It's permadeath, now don't get me worng, I enjoy permadeath like the OLD VERSION OF THIS GAME!! Though, I spend hours grinding hoping to God that I get a good item, I get it, and when I start using it, Kabam says i'm hear to **** up your life! And outragously drops my frame rate. Lag killed me, WONDERFUL! - Some of the classes are... unbalanced. How I say this? Well sometimes a priest is here (me) while i'm soloing a hard god, then a ****ing knight or warrior comes in like YOLOLOLOLOLO and kills it, steals loot and runs away. You may say that why won't I become one? Well, i'm not a freakin' 6 year old who trolls people. - They add in very dumb things, such as accessories, or different skins. You may argue that it may seem useful, but it costs quite a bit of money. Plus once again permadeath comes in and screws your money. - To get good pets, you gotta pay or earn it by extreme grinding. Plus the common or uncommon are next to worthless in my opinion. Plus it costs fame just trying to upgrade or fusion them. Fame is what you ask? It's when you do things that are worth fame or become a lvl 20 and kill a lot of gods. A deed for example is to not kill any slimes for your life and you get about 25 or 50 extra fame. Thing is, you have to die to get fame, so you can say good-bye to your grinded to death character. - Lag - Idoits you teleport to you and steal kills and loot (ahem i'm lookin' at you knights and warriors)  Overall, got money to spend? Go for this, a newbie? Don't try ot play this ruined game.  4/10
9779	0	a	Terrible game. It used to be good. Then after Kabam bought it.... The game is just plain p2w at this state.
9780	0	a	I just came back to play this. Turns out its a STORE that you spend money on character that have PERMADEATH so you can lose lots of cash. BUT WAIT!!! You start with 50 coins that cost money...too bad even the cheap stuff cost 51.  The game is ok, but you cant solo anything and the auto use potion on button press setting says to buy potions when your out, beware.
9781	0	a	Perfect. The best game and RPG you can get... except for 1 thing. No, its not that the developers are greedy (though they are) its this stupid glitch. The ad for whatever the deal of the day is pops at the bottom right so its impossible to click the x. Escape doesnt work, and ive tried everything. I recommend this game, but right now this bug, as its name says, is bugging me and I cant click anything beacause it is blocking the button to get to the portal. Until you fix this, I am not going to give you a thumbs up. Right now, you do not deserve it because of this glitch. And the only reason im mad is because its a good game.
9782	0	a	boooooring....... just try it your self
9783	0	a	Kabam ruined it
9784	0	a	Why not work was i keyborad move but this broken idiot
9785	0	a	Fun until you realize the pay to play aspect. Used to be really fun...
9786	0	a	♥♥♥♥
9787	0	a	PaytoWin in it's purest form.
9788	0	a	This is the game you play when your stuck on a 4GB laptop with terrible graphics, and is 8 years old. Its only fun if you are really really bored and have nothing to do in the real world.
9789	0	a	I have to unlock priest class to get an achievment, the bad thing is that i had priest when i started the game...
9790	0	a	This game is so bad i don't even know how to start the game... there will be a play button and when you click it you have to choose a class. I want to be the wizard but theres no back button or select button... very disaponting
9791	0	a	this game doesnt even let me play it i have uninstalled it and reinstalled it still doesnt work 
9792	0	a	'Its great!' A simple review in a simpler time. Almost 4 years ago now. Back when I loved this game I palyed it non stop it was pretty much all my free time.  Now I look at it haven't touched it in years. Though not entirely my fault on that one.  I got an odd glitch not one thats exactly rare as I know many who have I can't access my account.  I can't play with any of my characters or use any of the perks such as extra charater slots I paid real money for and inventory space back when this was the game I loved. Now its full of problems, pay to win, and bots so many bots. I used to run a guild became the top on our server. Made tons of friends and enjoyed a game together we shared happy memories and sad ones like when my five star priest finally bit the dust due to lag. Still I loved this game and wish I could play again at times, but then I remember I am forever stuck on the log in screen able to see my account my characters but never able to play because the company doesn't care.
9793	0	a	you have to buy evry thing and i dont think that it shold be for free if you have to buy so much
9794	0	a	Realm of the Mad God? More like, Realm of the P2P. GG Kabam.
9795	0	a	It is very buggy as it sometimes move your character and make it stop there do not download this buggy game 
9796	0	a	Use-Money-for-virtual-weapons-Simulator  Was good... Until Kabam ruined the game Now you have to pay-money-for-virtual-weapons  RIP- Realm of the Mad God
9797	0	a	It was a good game 2-3 years ago...
9798	0	a	This game is a total pay-to-win. The idea behind the game is amazing buy using IRL money to buy the in game money is why this game fails. If the game wan't a pay-to-win it would be 100 times more fun.
9799	0	a	I've played it for quite a while, but I feel like it's just so repititive, deffinatley not the game that anyone should play.
9800	0	a	This game used to be awesome but then once kabam came in they did like they do to all the games they own... Make it pay to win. Oh you died to this boss, well dont worry we can sell you some items for 20$ and then you'll be good..
9801	0	a	More ♥♥♥♥ than learning to speak Sweden. Dont Download. This game doesnt even deserve to get uninstalled from history.
9802	0	a	I love how broken the keys are
9803	0	a	WELL ♥♥♥♥ no one I know can buy realm gold it just freezes on my friends and I @%@#%#!@^^#%
9804	0	a	It sucks, and now I cry in my sleep, who the @!#$ made this game!
9805	0	a	This was one of best MMO's ever, at least for me and then Kabam just make it P2W.
9806	0	a	It seems like a fun game. But I entered a name and now I can't change it? Why do you need gold to change your name more than once. And there is no way of getting gold other than buying it...there are so many microtransactions that are spammed in your face as soon as you enter the Nexus of the game. So annoying and it makes the game lag alot.
9807	0	a	Just dont even download this its not worthy of taking a spot on ur steam list. Dont even think about downloading this piece of ♥♥♥♥.
9808	0	a	I guess Kabam ruined this game, whatever that means.
9809	0	a	Game doesn't even work for me, no matter how many times I try.
9810	0	a	When i played this onyx summoned the server and it broke mine and my friends game  Kabam also ruiened a game that i love i cri evry tim like this if you do
9811	0	a	Played this many moons ago. Shot things. Looted. Rode the train. Died....many times. No brain--no problem. Now...no game--no problem. Permadeath takes all, eventually--even games. R.I.P.
9812	0	a	Kabam ruined this game beyond saving.
9813	0	a	This game keeps giving me an error and wont load up, I have several times uninstalled and reinstalled. This game seems fun, but the error says- Debug list out of range. So I can't play this game, but I want to. 
9814	0	a	Wow, Kabam really blew the fun out of this game.
9815	0	a	Played since build 123. Had so much fun with this game. Hackers really screwed up the game for awhile, obliterating the economy. What they did was nothing, however, to the damgae kabam has done this game. RIP ROTMG
9816	0	a	A while back, this game was absolutely amazing. But, like everyone else on the forums, I really hate pay-to-win. Great game ruined. That and if you do microtransactions, the least you can do is continue to add new things to the game, not let it sit and rot while it still struggles to make money for your greedy ♥♥♥.
9817	0	a	it only let me create a mage once and then i die and can't play again so this game is a pile of crap
9818	0	a	The game would be fun if the game didn't lag as much, even when you're internet isn't actually lagging you can't control your character, and you watch it move around.
9819	0	a	I played before kabam. That was a time when all you could purchase was pretty colors for your character.  10/10 would buy pretty colors if kabam was replaced and p2w model was removed.
9820	0	a	They should've called this game ''Laggy Cluster♥♥♥♥'. Add 'everything is locked behind a microtransaction paywall OR a ridiculous amount of grinding' and you get exactly what this game is; Not fun.
9821	0	a	I used to play this game when kabam didnt buy it and it was fine,  but first i had 100 Coins then when i saw it was on steam i got it, made a different account and i had 50 coins, I was like ok because some things werent that expensive and then after like 3 months my friend and I wanted to make a fresh character. We both got 40 Coins. Also they made money expensive.  Kabam Ruined this game.  Message to Kabam: I would understand the game being 3$ or 5$ but P2W is just too much, many people dont have that  kind of money.   So atleast lower the price of everything for example: Coins, In game Boosters, etc.   In game boosters are not worth 8$ each. 
9822	0	a	This game used to be hella fun. But then Kaboom bought it...
9823	0	a	Game did some 'maintenance' on my account, and since then, I can't play with the only character that I have, nor delete it. To request support, I would have to create a new account on some kind of third-party site.  It's a shame, it was a good game...
9824	0	a	I played this game alot, it was my favorite game! Then... Kabam. Just... Kabam.    ♥♥♥♥ you, Kabam.
9825	0	a	I swear Kabam ♥♥♥♥ed this game with the biggest, blackest, ♥♥♥♥♥ you could find. kabam, I really thank yo for making a once awesome game yet another ♥♥♥♥♥ 'free' to play game. Thanks.

9830	0	a	This game is basically a roguelike RPG with really simple features, that can be fun at some points, but is just not enough for what It could be.  Characters and Items are really basic: There is nothing special to be found and better items are just more annoying to find and new characters just bring other abilities. There are even some classes that share the same equipment with just another ability and slightly different stats. For example: Playing Trickster and Assassin are basically the same thing, just that the Assassin can throw poison to apply a DoT Effect on the enemy and the Trickster can distract enemies with a decoy he spawns. They share the same Items and similar stats.   When you get into the endgame things dont change, you're just hunting for really rare items ,which will disappoint you with their lack of variety. They sometimes just add 5 damage to the attacks and they have a different sprite animation. Some Robes and Armors give you 1 or 2 stats aswell as some defense, but thats nothing special if you ask me. The higher tier the item is, the more attack/defense it has, thats it. Some unique items have another ability to them, but unless you're spending 10 hours straight to get them, you wont even know about them.   You can increase your characters stats buy using stat potions, which are pretty rare if you're not a dungeon slaying master at this game and its really annoying if you die after you've almost maxed out one or two stats.   My biggest problem with this game is the repetetive gameplay and the lack of variety with the items. All youre doing is holding left-click on a monster until it is dead and while doing that youre spamming 'A' and 'D' to make it miss all of it's attacks. The dungeons are decent, but its still, always the same gameplay.  I usually like farm games like these, where you have to work hard for your gear, which is the reason I spent around 1000 hours of playing Diablo 3 and Im still enjoying farming items to get something out of it. But this game just gives you another Item with a different name and sprite animation to what you already have and those dont even change your damage too much.I played this game a lot and I just dont think I should have. I had a Knight witht the best Items and 6 out of 8 stats maxed, so dont tell me I didnt get to play the endgame enough or sometime. Im not saying it's a bad game, but it's missing something for me.
9831	0	a	use to play this game on the website. went up to white start then weekly top. then kabaam bought it and ruined everything. then it became a pay to win. its pretty bad now. dont play it.
9832	0	a	Warrior can throw his sword and wizard's spell is firework THIS IS DA BEST EU. Just kidding another P2W game but slightly funny. Too expensive ♥♥♥♥ too bros, dont buy anything in game you may have to sell ur house or car or cat idk man
9833	0	a	Kabam is very good at taking great games and concepts and taking a massive stinking ♥♥♥♥ all over them by turning them into cash cows. They're like EA but (fortunately) smaller.   Realm of the Mad God is no exception. You can straight up buy items for cheap, which would normally take you a long time grinding hard enemies and dungeons (they also heavily lowered the droprates and made lots of items untradeable - go figure). I believe there are classic-style private servers out there - play those instead if you enjoyed RotMG when it went viral.  Shame on you, Wild Shadow Studios, for selling out. You threw away such a great little game.
9834	0	a	its pay to play the 1st stage of your character is free but when you level up to get to the 2nd stage character for ex. Warrior[free] /Bandit[600 coins] its not right especially for a game like this pay to play for everything even changing characters or characters name now i know alot of....well a few of people hate negative reviews but when i look at em i see whats wrong with the game so far i found no glitch or anything just its pay 2 play so if you wanna pay for everything forever using your steam bucks this is the game you would want, enjoy o .ob
9835	0	a	This used to be good.
9836	0	a	pay 2 win much?
9837	0	a	no dis ♥♥♥♥ is ♥♥♥♥ and no one should play it because it used to be not ♥♥♥♥ but den it pay to win
9838	0	a	If you find it fun to have to grind for hours to get your stuff back after you die the this game is fot you. If not it's okay, just spend 15$ and you get most of your stuff back.
9839	0	a	This game sucks
9840	0	a	PAY TO WIN GAME SUX!!!!
9841	0	a	big no! its better to play HappyWars Than this Pay2Win   if you want to achieve all all you need is to pay and not only you need to pay because its kinda sucks whenever you die in the game your stat will reset then what about the premium items you bought? imean when you die those premium/real money items you bought in this game will be going trash its better to play like HappyWars or FreetoPlay there's alot of f2p in the steam dont waste your time in this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ pure p2w
9842	0	a	People who have bad eyes and cant stand pixels Dont play this!
9843	0	a	I won't recommend this because how bad it has changed... I enjoyed the rouge like style in a mmo setup. Its now a very pay to win setup that turns me away. Its another 'It could have been' list of games that failed because using a strong for 'profit'   I am tired of those mmos that spark my interest and even go so far to change it completely for money than for fun. That ruins the game industry or anything when greed is the driving force for a company... not simple profit... greed.
9844	0	a	Pros: Easy controls Fun to dodge massive amounts of bullets Some friendly players drop decent equipment  Cons: Kabam monetized everything to hell Must rely on other players' kindness (drops or letting you stalk them) to get decent equipment
9845	0	a	This game was really fun. Probably the best game I have ever played.......until I died. I got addicted cause whenever I died I would want to buy crap to get better. Kabam ruined it and the fact that they lure you into spending money for the game is crazy. At first, I thought that it was amazing that the game was free......but no. It was fun while it lasted
9846	0	a	Was a fun game till Kabam bought it.
9847	0	a	Game was good, then Kabam took over it and made it P2W and frustrating grind hell. Never again.

9865	0	a	It used to be amazing. Now it's crap because KABAM had to come along..... many fun memories playing this game.
9866	0	a	I remember a time, a time before Kabam worked on realm of the mad god... those were the good ol days, but now I don't really like this game anymore. It is most definately a PAY TO PLAY game and no one likes pay to play games exept for rich kids.
9867	0	a	This game was a REALLY great game! Kabam! Please! See what you have done! Take thee Pay-2-win content OUT of the amazing game! It was AMAZING before you took over -.-
9868	0	a	The company that bought it (Kabam) has made it more and more pay to win, as well as added new content (some garbage, some good-ish). I would not recommend this game, because it is very addicting, but it also crushes you when x character dies.
9869	0	a	good but i can't make fullscreen!
9870	0	a	This game is very buggy. You cannot get the UI to respond if you full screen mode. Some screen generate and you cannot click 'OK' to proceed. Thus you have no choice but to click the 'X' and start over.
9871	0	a	It was buggy as hell. I had problems with the login popup being in thebottom right corner, and after finally getting it away, I died, and It seemsw like almost every window in this game dosn't have a back button?  
9872	0	a	Decent computer + Amazing Internet + TF2 = No Lag   Decent computer + Amazing internet + This = MAJOR LAG  This game = LAG.  Therefore this game is garbage.
9873	0	a	ok, this game was HORRIBLE so Steam says it's free to play? It's just free to download. just another pay2win game...
9874	0	a	Two words would change my mind about my recommendation: controller support.  This game begs to be played with a controller, and it seems like it would be easy enough to implement, but this is not an option. Even programming joy2key is an awkward control scheme due to having to use the right stick as a cursor control while moving around independently.
9875	0	a	I would say I love this game, and I do but for one reason I can't: Kabam. That is the reason. This game was flawless... until Kabam turned it into one of the biggist P2W (Pay To Win) games I have ever seen. Please stop the P2W aspect of this game. You have destroyed a perfect game and the only way you can make it up is by fixing what you have done. So fix it, or feel the wrath of The Mad God.
9876	0	a	It was a great game then Kabam its gone...
9877	0	a	Kabam ruined it Used to be amazing
9878	0	a	fist off let me say this game is fun, though it has a lot of flaws   1 you cant sell in game items which is basic for any rpg  2 its pay to win, yes you can get item drops from monsters but as far as the in game money is concerned you have to buy it with real money   3 the game is full of people spaming nonsense in the chat function   i love the 8 bit nes style but this game is not worth playing, majority of rpg games that are free to play have in game curancy you can get by playing the game which this game doesnt, if the issues i listed were fixed or if the just decided to make it non free to play and added in the most basic features this game would be awesome but untill then its not worth playing
9879	0	a	This game never started for me. I recieved 'List Index' Error.
9880	0	a	i cannot open this game, when i do it says; debug, error list index out of range. what does that even mean
9881	0	a	Ok lets see here.... since kabam bought the game, i have not been able to play on my pther steam account wich i had a lot of work put into. then i made this account and guess what? with the latest update i cant play on this steam account either. and when i try to contact the support they answer after 7 days with something that is not even relevant to my problem. at first i thought people over-reacted about kabam being bad and all but now i really see why. as much as this game is fun even if kabam ♥♥♥♥ed up, it is not worth it with all the trouble you have to go trough to actually be able to play the game.  as someone once said, if it isnt broken, dont try to fix it.
9882	0	a	Really fun **I CHANGE THIS** I've loved this game so much, now it won't even let me log in other than with my steam account, which means over 48 hours of work is lost. It was also turned into a pay to win game. Wild Shadows Studio was great, but now this is corrupt.
9883	0	a	this game basically costs 50 dollars now zz kabam
9884	0	a	Well, I did enjoy this game until my account was wiped for no reason... Along with all of my friends' accounts. $10 wasted, like seriously, what the hell? Don't put any money in this game, I wasted my life for nothing.
9885	0	a	This game is good. The only thing stoping it from being great is the, You keep walking and shooting in one direction, bug! It Drives me nuts!
9886	0	a	This game is just ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥ now. It used to actually be good but now they want you to hand over all your money. Everything is laggy as ♥♥♥♥, there too many hackers/clients/bots, too spammy, too much new OP ♥♥♥♥, luck is even more necessary to get things, it takes too long to get anything done, too many ♥♥♥♥ing beggers, and it's just complete ♥♥♥♥ now. An example of lag that I'm sure many, including you, have been through. Going through a dungeon (like I was on Oryx) casually then the game says no. Everything lags and when you press the up key once and let go, instead of going up one square, your character just flies up and up and up, (or whatever direction key you pressed), so basically your person flies in that direction and YOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING TO STOP IT! Spamming the nexus key does ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. Even CLOSING THE GAME OUT, SPAMMING THE ♥♥♥♥ OUT OF EVERYTHING DOESN'T! ♥♥♥♥ING! WORK! IT IS ABSOLUTE BULL ♥♥♥♥! Anyway, nothing works. You just lag and you can't close it out or nexus until AFTER you DIE! That's not fair! If the nexus is a safe place and it even tells you to use it for a quick escape, or obviously close out the game, THEN WHY THE HELL WOULD IT NOT WORK AND KILL YOU BEFORE YOU CLOSE IT OUT, RUINING AND WASTING 4 WEEKS OF WORK FOR AN 8/8 CHAR WITH UT TOPS! WTF GAME! ♥♥♥♥ YOU GAME! I ♥♥♥♥ING HATE THIS PILE OF ♥♥♥♥!
9887	0	a	oh its a lot of fun!    oops this review was meant for CS:GO  yeah this game is ♥♥♥♥
9888	0	a	the game is broken. all of the menu things are offscreen
9889	0	a	Its not good
9890	0	a	it was all fun and games after you met kabam
9891	0	a	♥♥♥♥
9892	0	a	Controls somtimes seem delayed and generally unpolished.
9893	0	a	A game with seemingly no purpose. If there were any sort of explanation what so ever I might change my opinion slightly. If you have a friend who plays it though, I'd prolly recommend.
9894	0	a	Kabam ruined this awesome game
9895	0	a	A robust top-down MMORPG, fun for all ages. Each class has separate perks and items within the virtual world of Realm of the Mad God. Huge community, many servers and options for playability. You can level each class up to 20, then grow fame to earn special shop items after maxed at level 20. Cross platform MMO experience is enjoyable across OSX, PC and Java.  Now, the pay-to-win scheme. This scheme was slowly built up over time throughout updates and patches. The bottom line of Realm of the Mad God is the business model, which keeps players playing and helps the developers to keep up servers. However, the scheme implemented has been highly controversial among players and ruins the gameplay for hardcore-styled players. Considering the only way to actually achieve highly-degreed items and pets in order to beat higher level entities is to pay money for these things, is something which considerably ruined the experience of Realm of the Mad God since it's initial release.   The community in this game is what really throws off most players. Spambots hopping on every server and spamming their websites where you can cash out gold, which are mostly fake and utilize data-mining. Basically any form of communication or friendliness in the game is rare since the chat gets spammed with automatic messages from the game and spammers all over the place. Who wants to talk in a realm either, where they're likely going to die? Did I mention gold is the only way to have a decent inventory in the game and costs real-life money to actually get? The entire business model is probably no different from any other bad F2P game I've seen yet.  The inventory in the game feels pretty satisifying with white-bag drops and specialized hotbar items. One thing about this game's inventory is that absolutely every time you die(usually from unwillingly getting teleported to Oryx for the first time) you lose  every  item you had in your inventory. You can get around this by storing items in your vault, but guess what? You have to buy gold in order to unlock extra vault space.Latency on the servers is a pretty big issue considering the influx of players scattered everywhere, not to mention the spammers I previously talked about. Even trying to hop onto nexus is sometimes literally impossible with the long delays and occasional game freezing.   The originality and theme of this game is probably one of the dullest, and storyline doesn't seem to exist. Every quest is 'kill the monster,' and the overall relevancy is unsolid. Maps seem pretty unorganized, and grinding in the game is near possible since the EUWEST server, the server with most loot, is always full with people spam clicking for hours to get inside. Normal realms seem pretty lame with hardly any good things to do except walk all the way across the infinite map to kill 5-6 monsters here and there. Then when you get into the good dungeons/castles, you can't even really play without dying unless you pay for really good items. Basically, the whole point of the game in a nutshell is to spend 20+ hours grinding, doing the same quests over and over again, buying loot, then dying so you can do it all over again so the developers can crunch on your wallet.  Movements are really limited, and any form of transportation across the map is physically impossible. Teleporting is an option, but you'll either end up in Godlands and die or end up closer to spawn then you were before. Pretty much 70% of your time playing the game will be walking endlessly through mostly empty areas. There's no special things like duck, roll, sprint or jump. I understand it is a top-down, but that doesn't mean they can't add features to actually dodge your opponents rather than using nothing except WASD, which is pretty slow.
9896	0	a	Game only for cheaters and bots. Too many hackers. Peoples going through walls. No effects such as paralize or blind to them.  Vmlpdbmh - one of the example. Account fame 65 758 - 90th place in the world, with the worst items. Saw him stucked in walls and oneshot titans with autoaim ability... Nothing happens. Nothing changes.
9897	0	a	i dont know how to change the cam???
9898	0	a	This one of the few games that made me sad when it got ruined.  Shame.
9899	0	a	I dislike the fact you have to pay if you want to end up anywhere... The coins in this game should be accessable through killing enemies then go to a store to buy useful items Though the game makes up with great fun and treachorous quests Quite fun but a bit of a ripoff for memory...  5/10
9900	0	a	Wasted money buying gold.
9901	0	a	this game is fun NO ITS ♥♥♥♥ING NOT IT IT WAY TOO ♥♥♥♥ING LAGGY HOLY ♥♥♥♥ IT WAS BETTER WHEN IT WAS NOT ON STEAM BECAUSE BACK THEN IT WAS PLAYABLE ♥♥♥♥ THIS GAME YOU CANT EVEN KEEP YOUR LOOT DONT GET THE ♥♥♥♥ING GAME
9902	0	a	p2w nuff said. If you wanna enjoy this game shell out a 20, then a 50, then 100.
9903	0	a	its okay i guess
9904	0	a	
9905	0	a	no this game is a wast of time and money dont get it
9906	0	a	Ruined My ♥♥♥♥ing life,10/10.
9907	0	a	Game is now P2W
9908	0	a	  I would really like to recommend this game, but with all that is wrong with it, I can't in good conscience recommend this to anyone.  Realm of the Mad God starts off rather fun. You start leveling up and exploring and getting new weapons. You start interacting with other players....But then you notice the really cool weapons and pets that the other players have. Once you reach level 20 (if you even get that far) you stop finding new weapons all together. By now you have most likely realized that when you die, you start all over again and you lose everything in your inventory.  Eventually, you come to realize that this is just another P2W game with ♥♥♥♥ devs  Scammers and hackers are rampant in this game, and Kabam could not care less. The scammers clog up the chat so much that you can't use it at all, and the hackers run around trolling everything. Almost all the legit weapons are not available in the playable world; you have to pay $ to get them. If your lucky enough to get a pet, you need to spend more $ to make it useful.  I enjoyed this game very briefly, but it was all downhill. Don't bother trying this one; it's not worth the effort.
9909	0	a	They made teleporting to non-guild members have a cooldown which is way too long.
9910	0	a	So many bugs Bear Grylls would eat it.
9911	0	a	the dumbest ♥♥♥♥ ever. nes games are still better in every way
9912	0	a	      Pro   Contra    Epic Boss-Fights  Perma-Death    Many characters  Lots of hackers    Massive Multiplayer PvE  Pay 2 Win    I've had many fun moments with this game, but  Kabam  Kebab ruined this game with those massive offers of spending real money on it. If you are willing to spend a couple thousand $$$, you can, without any problems, get the very best pet, that makes you pretty much invincible. If you have a couple thousand more, you can buy potions that let you get better stats, until you have maxed out stats that make you even more invincible. If you then haven't spend enough, you can spend about 50$ more and get the most OP equipment, making it pretty much completely impossible to die. It could have been such a great game.
9913	0	a	I love this game, alltho I'm terribly bored of it, after doing everything there is to do.  I will also add that this game used to be much better, as you could not buy gear with real cash.  I would not recommend this game.
9914	0	a	It has changed for the worse. Please do something about this oh might one.
9915	0	a	At this point don't even dowload this pile of garbage was kind of fun and had some good ideas, but now well R.I.P. Realm of the Mad God you will forever go down as a game that was mediocre at its peak.
9916	0	a	Do not play its to much p2w
9917	0	a	Yea, It &gt;WAS&lt; a fun game, before a bomb came along and &lt;KABAM&gt; it was crap.  Before You needed to work hard to get something decent.  Now See a guy with the best stuff and low stars and some med stars and be like, crap that guy spend a fortune on this game.  And a message to all the old reviews from before the Bomb, please update the review to matc the crappy now of ROTMG.  BTW for those people who said i only have 91 hours how do I know? I used to play on Kongregate, A LOT.  Conclusion: Wild Shadow Studios was better and ♥♥♥♥ you KABAM
9918	0	a	you are probably like y are u even commenting when you have like 6 hours well i have 700hours on flash version and just found out about the steam this game become so bad over the years and its getting more and more p2w type game they started sellling tops (Best tradble stuff in the game)at nexus(safe zone) without paying you hardly even geta ledgendary pet here are some pros and cons.   +good 8-bit style art +time consuming(in afun way) +playbale with large amonts of groups  -+you have too grind  - p2w -too many hackers  -too much lag if you dont have a good pc and wifi  i hope this comment has helped you on chosing to download or not to download this game but still give this game a go a few hundred hours of this game may be enjoyble.
9919	0	a	No Just No
9920	0	a	I didn't play Realm on Steam, but I can still say that it has become a piece of garbage. I have been playing since like 2012(I think?), and it was really fun at first, we had mass skype calls with school friends and it was tons of fun. My IRL friends tapered off and I found a guild and and a fantastic experience for about a year. I eventually got bored of the game, and came back after multiple months. As it turns out, everyone I knew had basically quit. I played for a bit longer, but I already had 5 6/8s on the account, wasn't going to buy more slots, and just had to start dropping my pots to the public.  Pros - Enjoyable for an hour every once in a while  Cons - Really easy to max characters. Once you max, there's not much to do but spend money on slots. Untiered (rare drops) items from bosses are untradable (there was a time when you could trade soulbounds; it was wonderful). Large amounts of the community currently are really bad at the game. Good players have all quit.
9921	0	a	I really like playing this game.  I found myself trapped in a corner with three foreign players trying to seduce me into a traphole! Eventually I fell for it and died.   Edit: I hate this game.
9922	0	a	RotMG, in my opinion, is a lot better on browser than on steam, but I do like how you start with the first five charactors.
9923	0	a	Needs a lot of things to work on as there is quite the amount of bugs contain within the game. Fun to play with friends but I would recommend another multiplayer game. Thats all I have to say.
9924	0	a	What the ♥♥♥♥ is this? What happened? The server has like a 3000 ping reaction? Not fun anymore, uninstalled.
9925	0	a	It's bad.
9926	0	a	Look I know you want to make money, BUT EVERY 5 SECONDS I RUN INTO SOMETHING THAT COST MONEY
9927	0	a	it was amazing until i had log in problems. Everytime i try to log in it dosnt even respond im am very disapointed please fix this problem and i will give a better review.
9928	0	a	WHAT A ♥♥♥♥ING PEACE OF CRAP MY GUY STOPS RESPONDING TO THE CONTROLS AND JUST WANDERS OFF TO NOWAER AND DIES YUO LOSE ALL YUO ♥♥♥♥ WHEN YOU DIE AND EVERYTHING GOOD COST MONEY THATS YOU WILL LOSES ANY WAHT A ♥♥♥♥ GAME
9929	0	a	I'm sure its a good game and maybe other people don't have the problems i do but i tried several times but i just kept getting wierd menu bugs where they were half off screen and i cou'dnt do anything but restart the game and try again but maybe it was just be so i'd love to play the game but i can't seem to get it to work at this time.
9930	0	a	not very good, it is trying to be too many things. at first it trys to be an mmorpg, then its trying to be a bullet hell, then a rouge like. and few other things just killed it for me, such as the full screen mode being just terrible looking. if you dont have the money to get any games i would recomend just get tf2 or something. remember, all games are free to delete!
9931	0	a	Lately this game has been getting worse and worse. And this new update was worthless but then they had to make a statement. They put in a 175 second delay on any teleport other than i guild member! IHATE THAT!!! it was better ages ago
9932	0	a	Played it for about 15 minuets then left as i was a** blasted with microtransactions
9933	0	a	game is fun and at the same time a pain in the ♥♥♥ lol but i no matter what i try purchase realm gold using steam engine its got me so ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off because i dont really spend on games and the one time i do and it just doesnt work SOOOO ♥♥♥♥♥♥
9934	0	a	I love the game, its so much fun. The way the producers have made all the different characters has made the more even more exciting!! I like how it stay in an old style pixelated style, showing off some really fun in-game experiences. Its just that this game can be very laggy, and disconnects very often. It may be because of my internet connection, but still I've heard some people with good internet still get a lot of lag. It would be very much appreciated if that producers can do something about it. For example, the fact that when you die it shows how many tiles you've seen in the game, to me I find that completely irrelevent, and not required. I think that the tile counting makes the game laggy(Sprite worlds).
9935	0	a	♥♥♥
9936	0	a	This game is the physical embodiment of cancer!!! It will suck away your remaining life force and feed it to the cows!!! This game will make you wife leave you, your children resent you, and your mailman question your sanity... and the fact that you never wear any pants!!!
9937	0	a	I love RPG games it can be the most enjoyable games u can never put down Realms of the mad gods is one of them its a fun rpg pack multiplayer games...   BUT!....  The down side of it that is evwerytime ur character died u lose everything and have to start over again it can be really frustrating and stressing to start all over again to gain everything OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN!...   To the developers u need to fix this mistake you ve made and make it: when your character dies you can never lose your items and return to the safe spawn:that would be most enjoyable thing... NOW MAKE IT RIGHT DEVELOPERS!!!!!!!!!!
9938	0	a	its bad
9939	0	a	A new and quite expensive pay-to-win system completes sucks the fun from this game.
9940	0	a	RotMG is a great game, but the devs have abandoned it. The steam version is filled with bugs, not working menu buttons, game crashes, and technical problems here and there. These wouldn't bother me too much other than the fact that THEY WON'T EVER BE FIXED! You're better off playing it in the browser.
9941	0	a	the older was better, but not only that, the game is broken for me, everytime i click my character, it goes slightly grey and i cant click anything :(
9942	0	a	Ok there is way too many spammers in the nexus and there is a lag spike when I go there because of the sheer number of them there needs to be a spam gaurd or something because that is ridiculous.
9943	0	a	This game is tedious and frustrateing, but addicting in a bad way.Do not get this game, it will suck 100% of your like away, faster than Wow and is FAR less entertaining. And I hate Wow
9944	0	a	Open game. Select character.  'YOU SHALL NOT PASS!!'  Uninstalled.  In all seriousnes, there is no way to contnue after you highlight a character, just 'Back' Can't even play!!
9945	0	a	This is a game i used to love and play on a browser but now its just bad. It makes me sad this is what its become because i used to play this with friends all the time. I would say try it out to see for yourself though
9946	0	a	Uhm.. i dont know why but.. it keeps crashing and i cant play it.. but last time i played this it was very fun.. (Alt account) i give a 3/10
9947	0	a	its ok for a free to play game  6/10
9948	0	a	What can I say? I remember playing for the first time on web browser. I never got that far (when it people crowded near portals to trade.Unfortunantly that died a few years ago) , but as a avid reader I loved looking at the descriptions of the  items.Why?  Because it was seeing cool seeing their story the lore. When I found out about the wiki not only did I get more knowledge but I got better at the game I really hated when players asked 'dumb' questions about the gear they got . Usually the answer was in the hover thing, but hey it was the time of GUI's and making things easier when their already easy.One of the things I did when the realm closed was sort out my inventory chose what I wanted and do a count down and drop the stuff i didn't want.Usually the gear was T3-T6/7 see this was when those teirs had value due to not every one being rich(buying gear potions, ect wasn't implemented).Then as I got better and no one cared about those teirs one of the biggest events that ever happened in the games history happened.Kabam happened I like to call the point onward from kabam owning the game the 'Dark Ages 'for all players the point where Wild Shadow anounced they were leaving the Silver Age ( many left the game due to Wild Shadow leaving the game) and the Golden Age is the point before the Silver Age. Little by little they destroyed the game with frivolous add ons (buying gear Ok I guess,No Kabam I don't want to buy your little package for halloween.) It all added up to me deciding you know what Kabam im done.I stayed because the developers that were in WS stayed now most have left ,but wait theres more! remember the time were you killed mules and many ad-bots?(I kind of liked the rich no longer being able to have that much resources though)Well you had a big flaw (many people lost there accounts) first of all if you typed you E-mail wrong you were done for 2nd of all you forgot that disposable E-mails allow for less powerfull mules(unless there is a soulbound weekend again haha) I just remembered this for about a year the wiki was gone until (they got the wiki up again yay!) recently your only alternative was a version in Mandarin? Careless on their part.So yeah Kabam was really just the worst thing to happen to this once lovely game. I really love the idea of the game but small acts have led me to Simply not recomend this game.
9949	0	a	Its hard to give this game a Thumbs down when its one of my favorite games of all time. Or well, it WAS one of my favorite games. I've put about 500hrs+ into RotMG. It was always a fantastic game with a community based on helping each other out. If you just died and lost everything, there was always someone to throw you a few high tiered items to get you back in the game, and in return if you find something you can't use, give it to someone needy. To an extent this is still true, but now it can take hours to have someone help out, more times than not, someone that offers help, is really teleporting you into the middle of godlands *Giant boss monsters* to watch your grave fall from the sky.  It wasn't the community itself that did this, but the developers. Kabam took over RotMG, and with there tentacles they squeezed the game for every last drop. They ignored hackers, they ignored scammers, they ignored DUPEING! There $$$ grabbing tactics and complete disregard for community security eventually ruined the community. Besides that, Kabam would truely spit in the faces of the community who offered advise, reported hackers, reported bugs, ect ect. Basically all of the greats in the community abondoned the game. And it was left with children with there moms credit cards begging and yelling at each other. Dragging people into godlands to watch them die.  The game is also littered with Buyer-Bots. Hackers who've farmed Godlands for pots *the community agreed currency* and trades them over-pricedly for higher valued pots which are all sold online for $$$ to the same childrenz. This also causes players to no longer help each other out, but instead try to over-price each other in exchange for pots to sell to bots, or websites for $$$.  At one time there was even a problem with peoples entire accounts becoming deleted from bugs after dieing. I had this happen to me, and was told by a Kablam Dev 'That sucks, buy some tokens and start over then.' That was the only reply i ever got. That sucks, Give us $$$, and start from scratch. ---  Its not quite as bad as it once was, and  RealmEye.com  keeps bartering alive to some extent. It can still be fun to play in small doses, but don't be fooled into throwing $$$ away. Kablam doesn't deserve it, and its only gonna last until you die anyway! :P
9950	0	a	I have 2 accounts with yellow and red star i used to be really excited to grind for white star but now adays the game has totally been ruined by the pay to win aspects that are all over stay away from this game
9951	0	a	It was fun when I didn't know what pro was.
9952	0	a	Awful game. Didn't even get to play the game. I spent most of my time trying to fix the game window resoultion. Things being cutt off the side of my screen.  The game is riddled with spam bots trying to sell gold. Otherthan that if you want to do anything else you have to spend real money!  Don't play it.
9953	0	a	Super laggy, Quit button does not work, you have to kill its process.
9954	0	a	IT;S THE BEST ♥♥♥♥ GAME EVER
9955	0	a	Little bit grindy, not much new things to do.
9956	0	a	Ive only played 12 minutes... encounter more than 10 bugs.. needs more work.
9957	0	a	In the beginning it was cool. Then kablam or something took over. Introduced a stupid ninja class. Game became laggy, and pay to win. Also the problem with cheaters and hackers isn't addressed properly. The game itself is still fun, but the economy is ruined.
9958	0	a	Too basic for my liking
9959	0	a	cant control my self and my guy fires on its own
9960	0	a	My character is about as responsive as a person's body in sleep paralysis. The steam version is absolutely terrible.
9961	0	a	Basicly its Pay2Win. If you dont pay you're the weakest.
9962	0	a	The game is absolute S**T you can't move while attacking causing you to die where you loose EVERYTHING level to items that you can't get back.DON'T PLAY THIS GAME!
9963	0	a	This is the worst game I have ever played. -10000000/10
9964	0	a	its so boring
9965	0	a	It was never an amazing game, just a fun one with a lot of potential. It was bought and that potential was utterly squandered in favor of some quick money. It's now less polished than it was when it was indie, and just generally not sustainably fun. It breaks my heart to say, but this will probably not give you any long term enjoyment.
9966	0	a	really laggu would not recommend
9967	0	a	Actually. when i first saw this i was interested. but when i started playing it. the game always crashes please fix this eventually. :D   if the problem is fix then ill recommened this to others. :D
9968	0	a	i cant play like alot of people it brings all of back to the select char place and we cant play : (
9969	0	a	Too money-hungry to bear. You unlocked a new character? Oh yay- oh nevermind, I have to pay for it. You unlocked a new class? Oh- Nope, still have to pay money for it. Want to do anything else besides grinding early-game stuff? Too bad. You have to pay for all of that.
9970	0	a	the ios game they ripped of was better, i dont remember wat it was called but, it looked the same and was better
9971	0	a	It seems like a fun game. But I entered a name and now I can't change it? Why do you need gold to change your name more than once. And there is no way of getting gold other than buying it...there are so many microtransactions that are spammed in your face as soon as you enter the Nexus of the game. So annoying and it makes the game lag alot.
9972	0	a	This game is fun, I will give it that. BUT. Currently you can't sell Items and it can get annoying. When/if a sell feature is added then This game becomes reccomended by me.
9973	0	a	Its very aggrivating. not worth patience.
9974	0	a	Ya know there little icon with that cloud at the begining of the game? Yeah, thats actually a middle finger, to show how they like to make you pay for just about everything. Characters, Character Slots, Coins, Some items, Potios if ya want, Most Pets, Storage, seroiusly it's rediculous! I'd be fine with the small pets and items, but come on! the freaken characters!? if you unlock a character you should have the right to play it, not pay it!
9975	0	a	Thought it'd be more of an RPG where I could level up character stats. Thought it'd be a game where I could collect items, sell, buy better stuff. Thought it'd be a game with more than one soundtrack. Thought it'd be a game that didn't ask for US dollars to advance.  ... I thought wrong. This game was not fun.
9976	0	a	Don't be fooled by the hours of playtime by my profile. I've been playing this game on the Web before Kabam   The ♥♥♥♥ing money-♥♥♥♥♥s   took over it.  Don't buy this game, it's too Pay to win to play. You literatly need to spend a lot of money to get more chests, which are things you put your equipment in. This may not seem like much, but once you know the game well enough, you know that 1 chest is wayyyyy too little.   Also the amount of hackers (no-clip, aim-bot, etc.) has been overwhelming. So much that it's hard to get good loot.  I loved this game before Kabam took over it.    ♥♥♥♥ YOU KABAM  
9977	0	a	Heavy P2W, but if you're into grinding your way up, with only one playable character until your current one dies, then you'll like this game. Unless you buy a character slot which costs 600 gold, and there is no other way to get gold except buying it with real money. And you only get like.. 60 gold when you start?
9978	0	a	Used to love this game but now none of the servers seem to work (I will change the review if it works)
9979	0	a	A piece of ♥♥♥♥
9980	0	a	lol. (I had to idle for a minute just to write this review.)
9981	0	a	the game is decent, but why do you have to pay for the main currency? it does not make sense, and you have to spend money on realm gold in order to get new classes, the events are hard and boring, the server seem expansive, but they are lifeless in areas. I would give this game a 3/10
9982	0	a	I recommended this game before. Now I'll take it all back. Pay to ♥♥♥♥ing win game. I hate it.  T H I S G A M E W A N T S T O H A V E A B A D T I M E .
9983	0	a	If you've seen the other negative reviews, you know why this is bad, and it's the community.  This game does require community to play, but, the devs won't pay attention to us anymore. They think we don't give constructive criticism. Well, they can think what they want, but the only advice i'm giving? Actually *find* a way to resolve this. There's many ways to actually counter this.  If you want to judge me, let me just say something, too: I played this game far, far back. When it was on Kongregate. Loved the hell out of it then, but now...  Why even try?
9984	0	a	I used to play this before and remember a fun lite MMO, not the microtransaction-filled game that it seems to be now. A shame.
9985	0	a	Before you let out a game fix most of the bugs. I have to exit out of the game 10 times before I could join then I could not name my person. Play this game if you like to rage.
9986	0	a	evry time i git back on the game it will not let me move
9987	0	a	Oh my god its World of Warcraft all over again
9988	0	a	this game isnt fun i tried to make it fun but it doesnt work i have 3 problems ith this game: 1. every area you go to has the exact same boss there is usually 3 or less bosses in the area's you go to nothing different. 2. its a god damn pay to win you cant earn mostly everything because you gotta get gold and when you buy something with that gold you lose it because you dont get to keep anything everytime you die i would play it if i could earn all those damn coins istead of buying them 3. its boring just so boring its not the same fo other people because they like these types of games because there either rich and buy whatever they want or just dont have any better games to play also ive met some stereotypes on here and when i recommend another 2D game they say 2D is boring but when i remind them that Mad God is 2D they say its because its a good game and if i continue the conversation they just end up saying the game i recommended is stupid without playing it.  anyways this game is bad REALLY bad im trying not to be offensive but its true i hate the game and its players.
9989	0	a	After playing this game for two years, with much more than seven hours played, my accounts have all reset for no reason.
9990	0	a	I love this game so much...BUT i remember when you weren't pushed to pay money for things. I wish this game could return to its old glory. Don't get me wrong. I still play the crap out of this game.
9991	0	a	It was good, that changed.
9992	0	a	Why do I delay on my movement?
9993	0	a	its pice of shet tibia is better
9994	0	a	The game unotifyingly stole 20 dollars from my steam wallet. I didn't purchase anything and it stole 20 dollars from me. I 'DO NOT' reccommend this game because it's a scam to steal money from people. In my purchase history it says that I made four 5 dollar purchases when I didn't make any. It said that I purchased realm gold. Well I didn't have any realm gold and I never planned on purchasing any. I want my money back or we're going to have some problems.
9995	0	a	I played this game a while ago and it was pretty fun. Now I can't even log in and have found that everything costs money. Whoever Kabam is can go ♥♥♥♥ themselves for being greedy slimebags.
9996	0	a	Kabam ruined it.
9997	0	a	Just asking to make you cry or rage.
9998	0	a	Had some friends recommed this to me. Tried playing had to repeatedly close and reopen the game as it opens ingame popups that position themselves off screen. This only happens in fullscreen. Since it is off screen you can't close it and cannot continue the game until its gone.
9999	0	a	I know I've only played like a couple minutes or so on the steam version of this game, but on Kongregate I've got like 1500 hours. I started about 4 years ago, and stopped about 3 months after Kabam started their Pay-To-Win campaign. All I can say is, why, oh WHY couldn't Kabam be satisfied with something like making the game cost $20 to play? They'd get their damn money, and it would suck, but whoever would be left would be people who actually cared. Instead they ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ized the game. Thank you, Kabam.
