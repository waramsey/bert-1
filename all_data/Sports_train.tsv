1	1	a	A fun mini golf game. pretty good and somewhat addictive. It has multiplayer, but unfortunatly only local, online multiplay would be nice so that you could play against friends online.
3	1	a	As crazy golf games go this takes some beating, and it is amazing with nividia 3d vision. Well worth a download.
5	1	a	This game you only want to buy it if you are planning on having friends or family over. There is no online multiplayer, only local. The last thing I like to do in this game is to learn all the hole and ones and then play my friends without telling them where they are lol.
7	1	a	Like mini golf? Well then you're going to love this game. It does a great job simulating it with some good humor , this game is great for all ages. The holes to be played aren't too hard, and its just a great casual game that is fun all around. Highly recommended!
9	1	a	Why is this hole a Par 2? Why am I at +38? Why am I still here? WHY DOES THE BALL ALWAYS STOP JUST SHORT OF THE HOLE? WHY AM I RECOMMENDING THIS GAME?!
11	1	a	this game is very good and have lot of fun
13	1	a	IT'S 3D GASP IT'S ULTRA GASP IT'S MINIGOLF GASP IT'S AN ADVENTURE... ...AND IT'S DELUXE!... ...But it's a cool game...
15	1	a	This is the coolest game that I've ever played. Me and Joe just spent 115 minutes in one session playing the local multiplayer, and i can say, without a doubt, that this is my alltime favourite game and i recomend it to anybody that has friends.   21/10
17	1	a	Basically the most amazing game ever.
19	1	a	UPDATE 9/28: revived by necromancer. game is OK, but I definitely had more adventures in the hellish afterworld than I did playing Mini Golf in Mini Golf Adventures  UPDATE: still dead  i'm dead
21	1	a	Good, fun game to play to cool off from all that pwning you've been doing!
23	1	a	its a nice game i would like too play the followerupper on pc.  but its not worth 10 euros. paid the full 10 and got 4 hours of play maybe its more worth if you got multiplayer but for a solo game its not worth it and difficulty sucks, first time i got +37 on the campain and secon -9 so ofc its all about learning the maps but the ai dont adjust and you cant change diff, the ai alwyas end up with 10-20+
15	0	a	Another Dejobaan title that starts with Aa... or something similar to keep it high on a list alphabetically. This was fun for about two levels and then it quickly loses any luster.
16	0	a	Can't recommend it for the sole reason that the semi-sequel AAAAA for the awesome is the exact same game but has more levels.
25	1	a	I really enjoyed this game, mostly because of its originality; most games aren’t about skydiving off buildings. I’ve come back to play it for a while, I want to say I’ve got about 2 hours into it. At this point, I need to replay some levels to get more points to unlock more stages, so I doubt I’ll play it again and beat it, but it was fun for the low price of whatever I got it for. Overall, I would recommend this if it’s cheap enough.
27	1	a	Thanks to   AaAaAA!!! A Reckless Disregard for Gravity   I got all the hugs and kisses I never got as a child!
19	0	a	Clever title, clever mechanics, clever bits of story/extra material.   There isn't too much more that's good about the game. While it's fun to play for a bunch of the levels, it slowly decends to a kind of perfectionist/point ♥♥♥♥♥ style of gameplay where you can only advance if you play previous levels to excess to get more teeth (in-game currency) and allow you to unlock more levels. I wouldn't mind so much if the teeth values for most levels were significantly lowered, but having to play and 5-star the easiest level 200 times to unlock the next level is tedious. Other than the occasional ARG content, it's not worth playing past a certain point mid-way through what's available and leaves much to be desired.  If you really want to play it: unlock all the little extra videos/audio content first, then see how far you can get. The extra little tidbits are genuinely hilarous by virtue of surreal humor.   Generally: give this a miss.
29	1	a	Make sure to base jump safely, taking all the usual precautions, or you might contract a disease.
20	0	a	halfway decent game, worthy of about two to ten hours of playtime, possibly more for those with ocd.  however, this was dejobann's last finished product and they have been selling only incomplete games for the last six years.  this game isn't so bad but it is not worth more than a dollar.  i wouldn't support dejobann games if i were you because they stopped completing projects about six years ago but they sell them all for full price.  this game may be a finished product but everything they have done since is nothing but one rip off after another.  beware: the developers/publishers of this product are robbers. no other product that they are selling is worth buying. and this one is over priced even at 80% discount.  you have been warned. 
31	1	a	First of all: The title is awesome and it's a great example for the kind of humor that Dejobaan Games stands for. Now, what is this game about? There's no real story to speak of. You are some guy, who does BASE jumps from very large buildings. Don't mistake this game for some sort of simulation though, you don't just jump off of real skyscrapers, but rather interesting and fictional constructions and there is quite an array of things to do on your way down. The game is very highscore oriented, so the most replay value comes out of reaching the best score you possibly can on each level and while that could sound dull to some, I really enjoyed playing it.
33	1	a	My Take: A frantic paced game where you attempt to reach perfection on each level and will not rest until you have five stars. Rude gesture to all the protesters out there.   Graphics: Simple polygons, but everything is distinctive enough that you can make out what's what during high speeds.  Sound: Enough entertaining noises to distract you from how annoyed you are.  Music: Not good enough to listen to on its own, but well suits the pace of the game.  Controls: Standard look and movement bindings, but I should figure out better bindings for the other actions. I end up accidentally pressing a wrong key at inopportune times.  Did I Finish It: Not 100%, but I got to the end.  Will I Play it Again: Depends on how much content is in AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!!, which I have yet to play. It's is supposed to have the same levels remastered, so I'm going to say no.  Should You Buy It: If the above holds true, they're the same price so don't bother.
35	1	a	AaAaAA!!! is a strange and unusual game. The premise being simple, score points by being wreckles while you base jump from floating structures. The gameplay is simple enough, control your decent, gain as many points as possible by 'hugging' and 'kissing' strucutres, hitting scoreplates and flipping off protesters.  Part of AaAaAA!!!'s charm is that it's completely tongue-in-cheek as far as 'the man' goes. It's a strange game that no one else has really managed to pull off with a correct mix of apathy for political agendas.  Even the title theme gives a good hint as to the attitude of the game. While it may be oler, it's still a great experience to hop on every once in awhile and stands out as a shining unique experience.
37	1	a	Great music, good idea behind the game but hard to master.  Why? Because if you want to make good scores, you have to be precise and avoid crashing on the buildings.  This game is about jumping from the top of a building (or a mountain or anything else) and to pass near every obstacle, to make a tag, to flip the bird or to make a cool gesture, to break plates with points on them, etc etc..  The graphics are good but the real strong point of this game is the music. Dat soundtrack.  Anyway, I really enjoyed that UFO from Dejobaan... if anything, it's thanks to Aaaaa that I played other games by them like Drunken Robot Pornography or The Wonderful End of the World.  Really recommended for fun.
39	1	a	Just cool :)
41	1	a	if you contemplate suicide. this game is not for you.
22	0	a	Get the remastered version.
43	1	a	The greatest 'slamming into everything' simulator ever.
45	1	a	A definitely unique and fun game. Difficult to fully complete, though.
47	1	a	not bad for the price. fast and addictive. it makes you want to replay the level over and over again.
49	1	a	I love it. It's a nice adrenaline rush with good difficulty and a quick reset. Also, it's zainy... TEETH!
51	1	a	I must say this game isn't bad at all. Think of it as a bungee jumping game where it focuses on you falling down and touching surface for extra points. You earn currency to unlock different stages as well. Although, I do wish there were more achievements, because there isn't much...
24	0	a	Pretty crappy. It doesn't let me change the resolution (Which would have been fine if it didn't fail to run properly at my normal nvidia surround resolutions), and it doesn't let you change the keyboard layouts (which would have been fine if it didn't introduce the grafitti action on a ♥♥♥♥ed up hand-contorting key).  So way to go, developers, you showed us how pointlessly anti-configuration you were for no god damned reason. Hope you're proud of your perplexing design decision because it ♥♥♥♥ed me up.  As for the game itself, some levels have a bit of a super meat boy vibe of short levels with challenging manuvering, but sometimes they make the levels long so it's hard to practice them, especially the end of the level because it's hard to get to it. Also it's a little needlessly unforgiving, such as falling on a 1 degree plane counting as falling onto flat ground, and catching the very corners of things should damage you sure but it just anihilates you instantly.  Another really messed up thing is that they're offering a one-time-only achievement. That's right, play now or forever have an empty slot in your achievement list. That's some really epic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Am I the only one who is annoyed as ♥♥♥♥ by that?
53	1	a	 Motion sickness, the game.   The title of the game is accurate. There's not a whole lot to say here - it's a well designed, simple concept that's extremely fun. I don't see myself playing this to the point of obsession, but I will definitely play until I unlock everything and see what else I can do with it.   For those of you who are like me, and entirely too afraid to actually participate in extreme sports like base jumping, this will confirm your belief that you're really not cut out for it. You will be perfectly satisfied to sit in your chair, breathe in through your nose, out through your mouth, and imagine yourself floating to the ceiling.   A fun little game that doesn't take itself too seriously, and has enough silly humor to make you smile - note that you won't laugh uproariously, but I don't believe that was the point of this, anyway.   Gameplay is top notch, soundtrack is fun and funny, and I will definitely enjoy any time period in which I play this game, but I seriously doubt I will get addicted to it. One of those rare gems that's worth anyone's time, even iff you just have a few minutes to kill. I, personally, enjoy games that don't require a huge time investment in order to understand what they're about and have fun with them, and this is definitely the type where your boredom will die for a bit.   Plus, after you play for an hour or so you'll exit and still feel like you're playing it.   Neat. 8/10.  (Small edit: I mean it's not very addictive. I meant to say that it was fun, but I don't see myself getting addicted to it. Fixed.)
55	1	a	A lot of people seem to like this. I have no idea why. It a freefalling game where you have to do 'stunts' to gain points really. Except, it doesn't look like a freefalling game. Yes, you have the feeling you're falling down, but that's it really. It's all in first person perspective so there's no actual character involved as well. The idea is cool, but its execution is kind of poor. It would've been so much cooler to have a realistic freefalling game. Like the realism of Mirror's Edge and the freefalling/parachute gameplay of Just Cause 2. But that's all just in hindsight. So all in all; it's ok. There aren't a lot of games with this sort of gameplay so I can't really recommend any better alternatives.  [Rating: 70/100]
57	1	a	Thoroughly unpleasant.
59	1	a	One of the best falling simulators I've ever played.
28	0	a	A strange little game I picked up years ago to tick an objective off one of the Steam events. I haven't touched it since... and from what I hear, neither have the developers.
29	0	a	' A Reckless Disregard for Gravity ' is a game based on a simple concept: jump off a high point, do some sick tricks to earn points, and land on the ground safely. Despite many positive aspects, the game is marred by several technical and aesthetic choices made by the developers.    The Good:    * Unique use of humor.  * Excellent sound track and sound effects.  * The base-jumping mechanic is a new, innovate way of playing games. It is a joy to jump from your starting point and hear the rush of the wind blow across your avatar's ears.  * Flight controls are good enough to seem realistic but forgiving enough to let you make a few mistakes and have fun.   * Plenty of unique ways to score points: getting close to objects, staying close to objects, giving spectators a thumbs-up or an obscene gesture, and spraypainting graffiti were all things I found within my first hour or two of play.    The Bad:    * For the world's first base-jumping game, the game feels remarkably NOT like base-jumping. Rather than zooming along the side of tall skyscrapers and landing on the ground, the player instead navigates an obstacle course of abstract, floating blocks that stand to 'represent' buildings and lands on a final circular block that is meant to represent the ground. If the player overshoots 'the ground,' he continues to fall. Yes, you can actually miss the ground. Interestingly, the levels that feature base-jumping off a mountain feature a well-modeled and detailed mountain that actually resembles something like a real mountain. (If you are going to use aestheticized shapes to represent real-world objects, why not do it consistently?)  * Every aspect of the game, from the UI to the action portion, looks and feels like a first-generation iPhone game. From the big, finger-friendly buttons conveniently placed on opposite corners of the screen, to the simplistic level design, to the generic graphics.  * The simple level design gives the game a very low difficulty level. I understand the point of the game is to score points and not just to reach the bottom of the map, but I wish there were a few more levels where it would be a challenge to reach the landing pad.  * Although there are several dozen levels (80), the variety of them is lacking. Each level is essentially the same as the last; none of them seem more or less fun than any others.  * No backgrounds in any level. Every level has a simple color gradient for a background. How about at least a simple sky wallpaper?    The Ugly:    * The game has a horrible name. There is no way I am going to talk to my friends and be able to mention this game by name, which hurts word-of-mouth recommendations. It's as if the developers  chose this name because they wanted to come first alphabetically, and then later released '1...2...3... Kick It' when they realized that numbers precede letters in Steam's alphabetizing system.    Verdict:    Watch a few videos of the game online. Wou will have more fun watching other people play the game than doing it yourself.
61	1	a	Base jumping's cool.
30	0	a	Very quicly loses its appeal. Nothing stands out in terms of gameplay, sound, graphics or replayability. Gameplay is even fickle at times, it's tough to say what will cause you to lose the level or what you will 'bounce' off of. Played for as long as I did to try and unlock all the levels, but I had a really hard time trying to force myself to play. Not willing to go back to previous levels to get more in-game currency to unlock variations of the same mechanics copy and pasted across a wall of cubes. Not even sure if the game is 'beatable', I'll be placing this title in the 'abandonware' category of my library.
31	0	a	Garish colors, grainy looks, lowres everything, and it even does not feel like you are falling.   Stay away at all costs.
32	0	a	If you like licking men's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s then you will love this game because you are a ♥♥♥♥♥♥
63	1	a	Silly, and oddly challenging.
65	1	a	HAHAHA DISREGARD THAT, I SUCK GRAVITY!
67	1	a	BASE Jumping: The Game. 80 levels, mostly involving you jumping off a building and falling near them for points. Has a peculiar sense of humour.
69	1	a	Only got this game mainly because of the competition, but its actually pretty fun. The basics is you use the wasd to controll your characters while hes falling and you do stuff during the fall to gain points before you get to the end and land...  The design is strange and the presentation sucks, but the core gameplay is actually fun and you unlock new 'abilites' during the way to keep the core game interesting. Add to that you can unlock any level you want from the level select screen you wont get bogged down on one level you cant get through. Gain rank in a level, 1-5 stars, gives you 'teeth' points and these points are used to unlock new levels. The concept works.  The resolution could have been better, but I recommend it while its on sale at 75% off and the competition level is the first one to the left you can unlock next to the introduction text boxes. The ach is pretty simple and you can also view it on Youtube if you serach the level 'Mash Face Against Mountain'.
71	1	a	This game is pretty quirky. It's unique and certainly very challenging but, for me at least, it wasn't interesting enough for me to want to finish the game. The challenge on most levels is just about memorising the layout and finding the path with the highest score. There are plenty of levels though.
73	1	a	 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzT6x9Fur3s&amp;list=PL3g25GfHOMYed-yhb0KiYKpueRIfEeY0W&amp;index=1 
37	0	a	If your the type of person who would jump off a cliff if someone asked you to, this might be the game for you.  The game is all about base jumping on a acid city replica of Boston, Massachusetts, some natural mountain landscapes and even places which look like they have been ripped out of the movie '5th element'.  The object is simple 'don't become a flattened pancake'. The other objective is to get a 5 star high score so you can earn 'teeth' the in-game currency (that's what we going to use when we run out of paper?) which you can spend to unlock more levels. Each level you complete you get treated to some funny news announcements or instructional videos. One video teaches you the do's and don'ts of accidental time travel, another video teaches you grandma's secret ingredient in her choc chip cookies being human remains and the list goes on. Most of these are either novel or groan out loud weakly executed attempts of humor.  There are a number of ways to build up your score. The main one is to kiss a building (get so close you can plant your smackers on it) and to hug them (free fall down at a constant close distance), but you can also do other things such as give a two fingered salute to red spectators (Mr Bean is Professional at that) and a thumbs up to blue ones, you can also graffiti tag certain buildings on your way down, smash into a bird, hit various glass colored plates for money, or perform the very tricky thread a needle move.  Most of the time you will struggle to do any of this as you will be too busy in a g spin of certain death since the controls are ridiculously hard to master. Hit a building and you become a human pinball against concrete flippers. I dare you to smoke a joint and try this with rift. You will be vomiting up your lungs as your characters nasal passage begins to smell the back of his brain thanks to the constant concrete jungle your treated to.  With all these things going on and it's unique game style you would think that this would be thumbs up material. It ISN'T. The game gets tedious and laborious fast. It gets too difficult too quickly, you might get 5 stars on two of the levels if your lucky. While it is possible to get 5 stars on the other levels, still you will soon discover that you will need to spend this life time, and your next reincarnated life time, or your next eternal life on a paradise earth, or your next life time being burnt alive forever and ever, but look on the bright side least you don't have to get five stars on this anymore.  The other reason it's thumbs down is because there is another version on Steam which is exactly the same, but contains more content with more 'polished' controls since it uses a different game engine. The other game is called 'AaAaAAAA!!! - for the awesome'. So if your interested 'Go! .... Go Jump off a cliff!.... What are you waiting for??? .... JUMP!!!!'
75	1	a	fast paced action and challenging game
77	1	a	If you feel bad about always wanting to jump off of buildings like me, then this game is for you. In this game you can jump off of buildings and touch other buildings to rack up points as you fall to impress all of your friends that coaxed you down from the top of uni last week.
79	1	a	I love this games style, mechanics and story. Definately recommend it!
81	1	a	why I think the sequel should have more  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaAAAAaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaAAaAAAaaaaaa in it
83	1	a	AaAaAA!!! captures the essence of skydiving beautifully and then some.
38	0	a	AaAaAA!!! You're falling! 2/10
39	0	a	This is the kind of game really should be in a browser. And it should be free. And it should be way better.
85	1	a	If I had the occulus and this had support I would have had a panic attack playing it. its a fun game to play when youre bored.
42	0	a	A truly inspirational game; after mere minutes of playtime you too will feel like jumping off a building
43	0	a	Absolutely horrible controls. Avoid.  1 / 10
44	0	a	orrible i hope i didnt pay money for this but i probably did
45	0	a	Just horrible.
87	1	a	A great way to pass the time, should work on nearly any computer. I would recommend the second game, as it contains all the levels from this game and more.
89	1	a	This is like Burnout 3 only you're falling not driving like a piece of ♥♥♥♥
91	1	a	Alright arcade game... 8/10
93	1	a	The beta was jolly, the full game is jolly too.
95	1	a	Very Very Exciting Game !!! The music too is just superb :)
50	0	a	3/10  In a nutshell: Fall and don’t touch stuff….  Pros: Easy to play.   Cons: It’s extremely repetitive. It’s hard to see someone playing this for hours on end.  Other thoughts: Save your money. Unless its dirt cheap.
97	1	a	I had a pretty fun time just falling c: This is really a game for completionists.. and people who love replaying thingss.. over and overrrr. Simple but effective gameplay and humourous style that doesn't take itself seriously at all. Some people will think it's lame and cliche, but that's point, really~ Good enough to recommend if you can get a copy cheaply. Not a bad game at all but one of those ones that feels almost like work too soon after you start playing.
99	1	a	It's a good game. Not great, but good. It hasn't aged terribly well and/or looks like a student's game, particularly with the models and random other images strewn throughout to try to distract you. There's a lot of replayability though, with leaderboards and really just trying to improve your own skills. It's not enough to keep me playing for that long, but it's a decent romp.
51	0	a	I bought this game a long time ago but never reviewed it. My problem with this game was that you couldnt look where you were supposed to go without speeding up. And controlling your speed was critical.  .....So the game is simple; jump off of a building, avoid obstacles, direct yourself though bonus areas for points, or just follow the fastest route.  .....Unfortunately, looking in a given direction moves you in that direction. So you have no control over your body, just your head. So if you look straight down, so you can see where you're going, you accelerate down. Faster and faster until you can't change direction fast enough to survive. Looking up or to the side slows you down, but then you can't see where you're going. .....On the other hand; while you can't control your body, it can kill you. For example, you are directed to skirt certain objects for bonus points, but if you got too close, your body would hit them and you died. The margin for error was tiny, and extremely frustrating.  .....I have this game listed under those games that should have been fun, but weren't.
52	0	a	All you do is jump of buildings. 2/10.
101	1	a	Just take the jump, fun game if played every now and than.
103	1	a	Personal Rating: 6/10 Genre: Daredevil Stunt Arcade Score Attack Plays like: Pilotwings (Skydive levels), very few games like it.  Very unique game about..well falling from great heights. Every level begins with the character jumping off a skyscraper and falling at high speed. You must hit score blocks and perform simple stunts to increase your score. Playing dangerously will reward you more points which is the main goal of the game. Nailing a perfect rating on each course will take many many hours. If you're looking for a very different type of game and love achieving high scores, this is the game for you.
105	1	a	FALL REALLY FAST AND GET THINGS
107	1	a	really like the game, but I couldn’t find the stupid cake 
54	0	a	This game isn't fun to play. It could be just a free flash game.
109	1	a	Interesting, kinda fun, quite hard, and very weird.
111	1	a	One of the most fun games ever. Challenging, fast and addictive, it's the perfect 'one more time' game
113	1	a	An abstract simulation of falling in the future--sudden stop at the end is optional. AaAaAA!!! is a pleasant blend of absurd humor and breakneck action that will leave you disoriented and slightly sore. A more grounded argument is at  http://www.pixelsocks.com/2010/06/14/review-aaaaa/ 
115	1	a	A fun little game that will make Acrophobia sufferers have an anxiety attack. I think there's a new version out that I haven't tried, but this one is pretty good too.
117	1	a	It's worth it. The gameplay, the style, and the humor is extremely enjoyable. Inexpensive to boot. Totally recommended for anyone who loves a fun game that isn't too challanging, but can offer it at times.
55	0	a	Having played through most of this game, I can safely say that I didn't enjoy a single minute of it.  The idea of base jumping through futuristic, laser-skyway cities has some definite appeal, but when it amounts to simply traversing around elongated blocks at a steady pace with some retro acid-trip inspired background trying to compete for eye focus, the product leaves you wanting.  The humor is 'LOL so randum XD' and the devs shamelessly plugged themselves into a number of levels. The game is basically built around high scores, in the same vein as classic arcade games. But when the leaderboards are dominated by hackers (a million points in the tutorial level? Please) with no moderation in sight, that takes out the possibility of an ePeen simulator.  One positive about this game is the level design. Some of the courses are really cunning, and I like game designers that twist and bend the rules of their own game to make a variety of new experiences.
119	1	a	A perfect example of mindless and innocent fun. A silly concept, but oddly addicting at the same time.
121	1	a	I LIKE THIS GAME SO MUCH I HAVE BOUGHT IT A TOTAL OF SIX TIMES NOW.
123	1	a	Simple, stupid arcady game not to be taken seriously. But it's fun to virtually flip people off.
56	0	a	Hey, just go for AaAaAA!! - For the Awesome, it has all of the levels from this game I believe, so unless you are just interested in half measures, this one probably isn't worth it.
125	1	a	SOOOO ADDICTING! Lots of levels, and random bits!
57	0	a	If you want this get, get the newer game. It is the same game just updated with better graphics and a lot more content.
127	1	a	All the fun of sky diving + more - danger = this! XD
129	1	a	simple concept, but very fun game
131	1	a	If you've ever wanted to base jump off a huge building than this again for you. It puts creativity to falling from the sky. The graphics alright. The music is really unique. It just has a charm that keeps you coming back for more. While falling you can give gestures to onlooking fans or give the bird to onlooking protesters. You can spray paint buildings on your way down. It's a very enjoyable game to relax to. The levels are very unique in style. There is much humor in this game and if you enjoy these type games then you won't regret buying it. A must-have for any wannabe skydiver!
133	1	a	This is a fun game.
135	1	a	Really fun for the price
137	1	a	It's about time I summarize this one. Had it for awhile now. Bought it a couple years back. A friend had gotten it first, and I tried it out.  It's pretty great if you're under the influence of anything. Also good at over stimulating yourself. The achievements aren't really tough, but take real long to get.  Good for a distraction, I liked the soundtrack, as well as the bogus jokes.  For it's price it's got a lot of replay time.  It's a stellar cliff-jumping experience, if you're not into the real thing.
139	1	a	Do you like falling? Do you like falling to cool music? Do you like giving the finger to people on the way down? Buy the game, support indie developers.
141	1	a	lots of disrespectful humor
62	0	a	I rather watch somebody ♥♥♥♥ for an hour than play this for 10 minutes.
143	1	a	It doesn't look all that exciting, but it really is a lot of fun. The flavor news casts and videos add alot to the experience. Seemingly unhelpful tips like 'Look up when you're falling up' turn out to be good advice.
145	1	a	A fun little game, like base jumping in cyberspace.  If you enjoy speed and precise controls, you'll have a ball. I thought it wore thin over the long haul though.
147	1	a	I heartily reccomend this, for it is quite good and also cheap. Buy it, or do not, for it is of no consequence to I.
149	1	a	I really like the game, but I couldn’t find the stupid cake\ 
151	1	a	Makes you scream AaAaAAAAAAAGNASHIIIITNOOOAOUCH!! ...... ._.
63	0	a	Achievement progress at time of writing: 5/7 (71%)  This is more like a puzzle game, with stages in which you need to base jump, get close to structures, perform actions, and land within a target. It's pretty simple mechanically, though it wasn't very engaging. There is almost zero story, just something about it being the new sport of the future.  What you see in the trailer is pretty much the game. I personally did not enjoy it all that much.
153	1	a	There is no better way to fall freely and have this much fun with it.
155	1	a	fun distraction that gets old quick worth a dollar not much more
157	1	a	It's okay, too much gravity.
159	1	a	Sort of like extreme sky diving. Pretty fun, if you can pick it up for cheap I recommend it.
161	1	a	It's a hilarious adrenaline rush.
163	1	a	A VR simulation of doing this...  http://youtu.be/7bJmVJZbmIk  without having to worry about dying. XOXOXO
165	1	a	Falling, with style. 0.o
167	1	a	Funny game ^^ ! But don't buy if you're feeling suicidal :]~
169	1	a	Don't play it, you'll get mad and end up playing it all day.
171	1	a	this game sucks don't buy it its crap
173	1	a	Some of the most fun you will have with your computer until they develop a force feedback codpiece.
175	1	a	I don't hate it but I don't love it either.
177	1	a	You have always wanted to jump off a roof. I know. There's no need to deny it. Now it's possible and even more fun than in your fantasies. Almost 70% safe.*  (* Not a valid method of suicide)
179	1	a	Hugs are my wifu.
181	1	a	It has an awesome name. What more do you need?  This is a game for people who are obsessed with maximizing their score and topping the leaderboards, or at least topping yourself. The game is entirely about navigating an artistic representation of an impossible city as you jump from the tallest building and weave your way through the concrete maze to land safely at the bottom. On your way down, you'll collect bonuses for staying close to buildings as they whizz by and smashing through targets. That's about it. As you unlock more levels, the challenges get tougher, but this is a pretty fun distraction if you've got a few minutes to spare.
183	1	a	Defently worth playing if you enjoy trying to do as best as you can. Random commentary, music and unlockables, let alone so many levels and things to go back and try, really do make this game good.
185	1	a	I did this for one of the steam gifts, but honestly, this is one of the better indie games I own on Steam. Base jump, break through glass, flip off onlookers, and 'kiss' walls to a high score. It's a ♥♥♥♥ ton of fun.
187	1	a	This is weird, trippy and awesome. Kiss the buildings and hug the walls. Flick the fingers at the moaners. This is the shiz.
189	1	a	This is the greatest game I've played since Super Mario Bros. 2. It features a foul-mouthed degenerate who enjoys jumping off buildings and landing on the hard pavement below.   The game features some of the best voice-acting I've heard in a video game, but what really stands boner out is the games ability to give you a massive gamenema.   I enjoyed this game because it is a good suicide emulator for people who like to jump off high places and flip off walls.   Game gets a 8/10 for having large amounts of falling and that's about all. Also, there is a level where you have to catch falling babies before they hit the pavement, but it's impossible because they have rockets attached to them pointing to the ground below.  I got kicked in the groin alot by the big dinosaurs and uniformed japanese officers.   This game has everything, even a game inside it, it's a game within' a game, kinda like Pokemon Puzzle League.   To quote a great man 'Game is good game'  Get it.
191	1	a	It's more fun than I expected.
193	1	a	Got this for the steam treasure hunt, spent way too many hours playing it since then. Great game!
195	1	a	Fun game. Plays well on a laptop with intel graphics.
197	1	a	Play it. You won't regret it. Trust me.
199	1	a	Fun and educational. A+++ would fall again.
201	1	a	A visually stunning game with perfect sound effects to match the gameplay and a great soundtrack. If you love flying or gliding in games, you will love the feel of this game.
203	1	a	I know this Dejobaan game came before Drunken Robot Pornography, but I played DRP first, and amazingly, that game was actually easy compared to this one. Despite the fact that this game is frustrating as hell, it is still amazing. Graphically, right from the first spit second of the menu screen, this game is a thrill to play. Unlike DRP, this game says exactly what it entails, and that is the sound you'd be making if you were the protagonist in this game. You jump off a building, you scale buildings for points, you meet score quotas to earn stars which, in turn, earn you teeth which you use to unlock new levels. Again, like DRP, Dejobaan proves that you don't have to be complicated to be an amazing game. Just pair stunning visuals with great music and COUNTLESS levels. I've been playing this for a hours and i still haven't unlocked them all. And for a game where all you do is fall, that's pretty damn good.
205	1	a	A basejumping game with a style similar to the old school skateboarding games. (This game makes me think of the old Playstation title Grind Session.) The gameplay couldn't be simpler. W,A,S,D for movement and space to deploy your parachute. Try to get as close to the buildings as possible without actually crashing into them, and try to collect as many points as you can on the way down. What's not to like?
207	1	a	Great indie game with a good sense of humour and original gameplay mechanics. Great indie developer.
66	0	a	A nice game to buy when it's on sale. Plenty of content, but I got stuck after a few levels and couldn't progress any further because I couldn't get enough teeth. Check out my full review here:   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvG8mVlxCpQ 
67	0	a	Dream Entry 235  It came back. I thought I was rid of it but it dragged me back like some horror movie monster. Once again I was falling. I was hugging and kissing buildings. I was rude to random people I didn't even know. Worst yet, I think I killed a bird. That feeling of dread when your body is plunging towards the earth, that rush of pulling the rip cord and letting your feet touch the ground. I hate it. It is too loud, too disjointed, just too much. Why where there people there watching me fall like it was some kind of spectator sport? If there is a merciful God out there, he will end these nightmares of sky and wind. He will stop torturing me with the pain of the bright lights and sounds. He will end the pointing and laughing of these perverse strangers and not make me the death of that poor bird. But I know he won't. That sick ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. 
209	1	a	 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22DgMLjEM0g  If you rolled the skydiving game from Pilotwings in LSD and sent it hurtling into the future, you’d surely end up with something similar to A Reckless Disregard for Gravity. The game is set in a psychedelic, alternate-reality version of Boston, Massachusetts in which buildings are nonsensically scattered throughout 3D space. This convoluted landscape provides the perfect playground for base jumpers with a reckless… you know. You play as one such base jumper from a first person perspective. Each level sees you taking a leap of faith from the tallest building, navigating your way through an architectural maze, then gracefully landing on a platform at then end. On your way down you rack up points by maneuvering dangerously close to obstacles and smashing through glass panels. As you progress you’ll unlock other abilities such as flipping off protesters and giving your fans a thumbs up. Snaking your way through a deadly obstacle course while chaining together the appropriate gestures is incredibly satisfying. It takes some time to get used to the controls, but the payoff is worth it. I would have liked to have seen joystick support, and the menu system could use some serious work, but otherwise A Reckless Disregard for Gravity is a clever game with a fun sense of humor that will leave you itching for one more jump.
211	1	a	An odd game that is equal parts adrenaline and frustration. It's a nice little break from the ordinary, but it's not something I can play for hours and hours.
213	1	a	The jumps you make are not about science, they are about a reckless disregard for gravity. WOOOOOOOOOOWEEAAAAAYEAHAHAAAAAA.
215	1	a	Funny, off-beat, slightly weird, and definitely insane, AaAaAA!!! is worth every penny just for Nebin the radio announcer alone. The levels are fun, twitchy, demanding, and always something different. With titles like: 'Crandall Tower now with Extra Pea Soup' and 'The Illuminati are just People with Lamps' the game is a treasure trove of non-sequiteurs that is perfect for 3am gaming when the insomnia is making the hallucinations kick in.
217	1	a	Exactly what it looks like. Do you find yourself finding the tallest mountains and buildings in games in order to fling yourself off them? Well, this is that game and nothing else. Bro.
219	1	a	This game is pretty fun in small doses, I wouldn't pay 10 bucks for it though.
221	1	a	Oh, now I know the proper name - AaAaAA!. The game is totally awesome, and I recomend that one to you. Just try it.
223	1	a	Gravity sucks, this game fixes that.
225	1	a	This is the best game about intentionally breaking every bone in your body ever made.
227	1	a	There...are no words to describe the level of insanity this game operates on. It's as if the insanity from one dimension overflowed into another dimension which was full of highly illegal substances, and those two dimensions said 'screw it' and jumped off a building. This isn't a game, it's an experience.   I'm going to have a lie down.
229	1	a	Falling at high speed through psychedelic landscapes, constantly trying to balance risk vs reward as you scrape past buildings certainly has its thrills even if they are short lived. Also in the game.
231	1	a	I think the devs were completely stoned. However, that's not a bad thing - they designed an interesting, if trippy game.
69	0	a	'Vertigo is anguish to the extent that I am afraid not of falling over the precipice, but of throwing myself over,' Sartre said in Being and Nothingness. When I consider the possibility of me playing this game, I consider one of the possible possibilities not determined by a foreign cause, but by my own being instead. As someone who avoids death would avoid a precipice, I avoid anguish by nihiliating the possibility of me deciding to play this game anymore.   AaAaAAvoid this game!!!
233	1	a	While full immersion, force-feedback enabled first-person base jumping games are still a ways out of the reach of current technology, Reckless Disregard makes me hopeful for the future. In the meantime, I will utilize my high suspension of disbelief stat and create my own immersion while plummeting to my death in this game.  Good times!
235	1	a	Fun game for what it is. Its like a game where you jump off a building trying to either pass through point circles or 'touch' other buildings while falling. A bit tricky to get a good score. Played the heck out of it during the Portal 2 Arg. Then never touched it again.
237	1	a	On this day, the people of America will turn their 186 million blue eyes to you as your change of career has you jump into a figurative hole so deep that it may as well have been a real one
239	1	a	Hahaha, this game is awesome. It's not about science, it's about a reckless disregard for gravity.
241	1	a	You'd be suprised how awesome First Person base jumping can be.
71	0	a	Sort of fun. Get's old fast, You do the same exact thing x100 for each level.
243	1	a	this is a good game if you are bad at platformers because you get all your points for falling off ledges
245	1	a	Falling, flipping off people who don't like you and repeated jokes about the numerous ways you die. What more do you want?
247	1	a	THis is wacky fun. But if you have vertigo (fear or heights) have a puke bucket handy!!
249	1	a	Skydiving/Base jumping game. Good to burn time on but nothing super special.
251	1	a	It combines the rush of jumping off of very high things with the smug satisfaction of flipping off protestors. It tries a bit too hard to be clever and self aware but it's still a lot of fun.
253	1	a	One of the best times you can have with your pants on. So much replayability in such a small package. Oculus Rift support to true immersion. I love it.
255	1	a	This game actually gave me a sense of falling, People with acrophobia stay far away. Such an amazing rush/feeling which not many games give. The music is also very good. There is no other game like this!
257	1	a	One of the craziest and most addictive games I have played. Always trying to top your high score will drive your wife or girlfriend bonkers because 2 hours after you told her, 'just one more,' she will be standing in your office doorway with the look of death on her face.
259	1	a	I love these games where you just get a rush playing it! This game cannot be judged by screenshots! Watch the videos to get a better feel of what it's like. The content in the game is Hilarious, some of the comedy is on par with Napoleon Dynamite for just plain idiotic banter (and i love it!). This game will actually make you feel to go base jumping 75 years from now when cities look like those ingame.
261	1	a	I did not attack this game with the same tenacity I did Portal, however it has held up over time. Portal, is still a great game, but I beat it. This game rocked my sox for a period of a couple of weeks, and again everytime I choose to pop it open. Bright colors, cool music, and incredibly challenging environments would lead me to say that this is one of my favorite games of all time.   TL;DR Buy this!
263	1	a	A First-Person Faller, if you didn't catch that. It's kind of like Tetris, and you're one of the cubes (tetrominoes, I guess)! It's actually really fun, and would be a blast in VR!  (Pro-tip: don't jump off the building using the Spacebar.)
265	1	a	Highly recommended, if you are looking for a good challenging platformer, this may be for you.
267	1	a	Very fun game. plenty of content
269	1	a	This might be the best game I paid money for this year, and games I bought this year include Left 4 Dead 2, Fallout 3, and Mass Effect 2.
271	1	a	I thought this game was the ♥♥♥♥ when I first heard of it. Takes some skill to master this game.
273	1	a	A great game, very quirky and awesome. It does not disappoint and always keeps you entertained!
275	1	a	very funny game, with cool music, nice commentary, and funny movies xD
277	1	a	AaAaAA!!! - A Reckless Disregard for Gravity is an average game built on a fairly unique concept of doing tricks while falling off fantasy suspended structures. While the game does feature a wide variety of playmaps and modes, and the unlocking and teeth currency system are welcome, the game has some pretty noticeable flaws. First and foremost is the lack of controller support, which given the twitch nature of the gameplay seems like a must. Secondly, the game does not feature any interesting music and the sound effects particularly for the parachute are quite poor. I had fun with this title for a few minutes, but the tedium grows as these flaws repeat over each game session. I would recommend this game only to action fans who want a novel concept but caution others to stay away.
279	1	a	Jump off of ♥♥♥♥ and don't die
281	1	a	im falling and i cant get up
283	1	a	i reccomend this
285	1	a	A goofy game where you base jump through hoops while trying to flick people off. Punk style sense of humor and strange array of difficulty distrobution in the levels make this game interesting and fun. I beat most of them pretty quickly though.
287	1	a	Fairly addicting game if you are into those arcade-like games that have intricate scoring systems. It's a B.A.S.E. jumping that encourages hugging buildings as closely as possible without running into them. With the distinct simplistic art style it has managed to create an image for itself. Recommended.
289	1	a	I dislike Dejobaan games, very much. They feel cheap and ill-maintained, as well as little consideration to practical functionality.  On the other hand, that can all be overlooked with this one. Sure, the menu system is terrible, sure it takes too much effort to organize - but what a fun little game!  The objective is basically to hug buildings, survive and land well; in that order. Hugging buildings is very fun - it can get tricky at times but that's the challenge really. The levels are a little short and I haven't unlocked the bigger, harder (?) ones - but for now i'm satisfied.  Surviving is however easy to make it for yourself; those high points only come from kissing/hugging buildings (their terminology, I promise you). It takes some practice and a few quick-thinking moments but you can rack up those numbers. There's even 'bonus' things to smash. Lastly is landing safely; relatively easy to get it into the landing area.  In summary - a great little mini-game, lazy developers.
291	1	a	As punk as a Jeff Minter game. Worth playing for the experience. ♥♥♥♥ the actual game, cos while it has its moments, that ain't why you're here.
293	1	a	Crazy and deserving of a lot of attention. Excellent vertical First Person strangeness!
295	1	a	Great game, loads of levels, hours of fun!
297	1	a	Awesome game. It really has everything from a game mechanic centred arround flipping people off to a built in anti-relaxation script in case your life is too calm and relaxing and you want to imagine insects crawling over your skin. Oh and there's a pretty awesome addictive falling game in there as well.
299	1	a	As long as you can handle a little vertigo, you won't regret this game. Indie, stylish, quirky, fun. The only thing it's missing is multiplayer.
301	1	a	This game could not be any more indie unless the developer cut himself in half. Seriously though the game isn’t half bad and if getting gold medals gets your jimmies rusled then go all for it.  
303	1	a	Insanely simple, yet motivating game. Falling at its best!
305	1	a	A nice experimental game style. You are a base jumping freak, in a totally freaky world. Try to fly through gates, spray buildings and high-five your fans.  I like the absolutely messed up ideas. There are different parts of the game which are unbelievably crazy. Undescribable.  6 out of 10*
73	0	a	Game aims to recapture extreme skydiving. It fails. Game gets the silly idea that skydiving would be more interesting with floating buildings... it just makes the game seem less immersive. The graphics heavily distract from the game, and don't add to it at all. They tried too hard to look hip, anot not enough time trying to be good. Game would have been significantly better if instead of going through the tricky level design, if they had just grabbed some 3d data of the world and made base jumping in famous locations.   I can see their reason for their 'floating cities' (to make their base jumping take longer) but if they're going to try that, they should at least make their floating cities look like floating cities above distant ground and not shipping containers being thrown at you by a wall of neon lava.  I'm not normally one to complain about graphics (look at my other reviews if you don't believe me) but the graphics and level layout in this make the game horrible.
307	1	a	An interesting indy game that will keep you playing for hours. The gameplay is simple, but challenging, and keeps you shooting for the highest score. A great indie game to try out and master.
309	1	a	This game is more fun than it should be. The game mechanic is unlike almost anything out there, the levels are similar to each other but with enough differences to keep it interesting, it offers high score challenges to accomodate any level of player and the humor and 'story' of the game are all enjoyable. Even the progress system as you choose levels and unlocks is fun and how often do you ever hear that about a game.
311	1	a	Epic Base Floating Flying Jumping game for the people who whould like to try it out well here's your chance now. (Remember Don't Try this at home)
313	1	a	A fun game, but due to it's simplicity I wouldn't reccomend spending more than a few dollars on, very arcade-y.
315	1	a	A nice original indie title, the graphics aren't much to look at, but the gameplay makes up for it.
317	1	a	I like to wear a pork pie hat and nothing else while I frolick around the city of Boston, Massachusetts.
319	1	a	my gode budey funNxz gifted me dis gam bcuz he sawe me creying n he sed  dis mak u hapey  n i sed  ok  so in dis gam u jump of buldeng  buy dis gam
321	1	a	Seriously addicting
323	1	a	Fun game at Try to not Hit FLAT surface and DIE !
325	1	a	Not only does this game amuse you for hours with freefalling pleasure, but also is one the funniest games I have played in a LONG time. DIS GAME IS GUD :D
327	1	a	Gets VERY repetitive because the whole game revolves around dodging blocks while free-falling with the occasional wall to spray paint or fan/critics to wave at. Your money is better spent on just about anything else. Meh.
329	1	a	A game that simulates projectile vomit hangover and bad LSD trip.
331	1	a	One of a couple of base jumping games available on Steam. It's nothing special, fall while scoring points by staying close to objects without hitting them and trying to pickup extras where you can. More points equals more stars, more stars equals more teeth and teeth can be used to unlock extra levels.  No surprises or plot, just straight forward action. Not a bad game to switch your brain off to.
333	1	a	Its an unusual game with a psychedelic touch. At first, I didnt expect too much from it when i bought it along with some other indie games... but then I tried it and ... I simply couldnt stop any more... falling...playing. *doublethumbsup*
75	0	a	I found this game to be too repetitive for what it is.
335	1	a	I got this game from crafting coal, and I love it already. It's got great music, fast-paced twitch gameplay, and a very odd sense of humour.
76	0	a	I just could NOT get into this game. The name of the game really attracted my attention, but the gameplay and mechanics just aren't there for me. Some people may like this game...but there are much better 'twitch' style games out there. Its a decent attempt though! Same applies for their other three that are nearly identical.
337	1	a	AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA is a great game that i can imagine nobody has heard of. I got this game cheap with the potato sack and it has more than been worth it. Great game with a unique feeling and great fun.
339	1	a	Its not the fall that kills you, its the breaking every bone in your body when you miss hitting the parachute on time at the end.
341	1	a	11/10 Would disregard gravity again.
343	1	a	This game is brilliant. Jump from the top of a floating city and score big points for scraping your nose on the sides of the buildings. Tag government buildings and flip off protesters; it's as bizzare as it sounds.  However, don't buy this game, rather, buy the remastered psuedo-sequel for the same price: AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! for the Awesome. You get all the content seen here and more. As well as a more in-depth review.
345	1	a	This game is a REAL adrenaline rush a times. its also really funny. give a go, you wont be disapointed.
347	1	a	The jumps you make are not about art, they are about a reckless disregard for safety.  The jumps you make are not about culture, they are about a reckless disregard for regulations.  The jumps you make are not about science, they are about a reckless disregard for gravity.   *Jump*
77	0	a	There's a reason they keep tacking sale achievements on this game. No one else would buy it otherwise, because it is not fun.
349	1	a	This surprisingly simple game decieves you...it lures you in 'Come play me,' it says 'Only for a few minutes it won't take long.'...8 hours later you have blisters, have slammed your face against buildings countless times. Gotten one or two '5' star levels and are swearing that JUST ONE MORE TRY and you'll BEAT THIS ONE LEVEL.  ....the music is to die for by the way, I WISH I could buy the OST.
351	1	a	A fun and surprisingly addictive 1st-person falling simulator. A lot of fun maps with Dejobaan's weird atmosphere make this game well worth its asking price.
353	1	a	It's arcade, it's action, it's simple (but not easy). The fast paced and easy to pick up gameplay provides decent fun for a while, but horrendous UI make selecting levels a chore and there's no real incentive to go back and replay levels. A difficult recommendation, especially at it's regular price.
78	0	a	I bought this for a Potato trophy on steam during some potato sale. It is like a potato game quality. Loses appeal about as fast as a potato. I should've bought potato.
355	1	a	who woulda thought that falling and killing yourself was fun. o wait your not spose to do that... but its fun anyways and for 1 cent i got from the humble bundle its a win in my books
357	1	a	This is a cheap, but very addicting game that will have you going back and replaying every map just to get that one little thing you missed until you're twisting, turning, and flipping your body around skyscrapers like a BOSS!
359	1	a	From the most disinterested newcaster, to the unusual guides to making cookies, AaAaAA!!! is a game that will pull you along for the fall (literally). You are a base jumper in a floating city the seems to have a '♥♥♥♥ the government!' attitude, and you jump off buildings, falling close to other buildings to gain points. If this doesn't seem interesting to you then you need help.  You can graffiti buildings, flip off spectators, smash into birds, break through scoring glass, fly so close to rugged mountains that you'll lose your belly and ♥♥♥♥ yourself laughing at some of the in-game antics.  Buy this game, you'll never regret it.
79	0	a	The game has a cool idea and interesting visuals, but the game get old for me after a view minutes of play. Not my cup of tea.
80	0	a	Good game to test your screaming as you free-fall.
361	1	a	A fun way to kill a few minutes.
363	1	a	A fun falling simulator, AaAaAA offers many different falls as you try to hug and kiss every surface before landing in the designated spot. A good grab if you are into those kinds of games.
82	0	a	There isn't anything in this game to hold your attention for an acceptable amount of time. It's fun for a brief few moments, but you'll just be doing the same thing over and over again. It's one of those games which doesn't really grasp the concept that fun isn't enough to support an entire game. Its entire draw is that the core gameplay is fun, but everything else is utterly lacking. There's no story and nothing to hope for as you progress through the game. You won't find yourself wondering if new game mechanics will be added. You won't find yourself wondering if a new upgrade will change how you play the game. You start the game, and then you have the option to keep playing forever. If you're a REALLY big fan of the engine and place no value in your time, then you might get more enjoyment out of this game than me. But it's 10 dollars! Don't spend that much money on a game like this! I can personally recommend a dozen flash games that will give you a more rewarding experience. Especially considering that they released a better version of this game which COSTS THE SAME AMOUNT!!  They're trying to fleece you. That's the best way to describe this. You're given a little bit of fun at ten times the price it should be. The product that you're given isn't meant to stand the test of time at all. It's only meant to be good enough to keep you from complaining.
365	1	a	Stupidly Awesome amounts of Fun!
367	1	a	Freefalling through point boards and hugging the sides of buildings is pretty damn fun. The real winner though is the game's sense of humor.
369	1	a	this ♥♥♥♥ing game makes me ♥♥♥♥ing angry but satisfied at the same time!!! 10/10!!!
371	1	a	An amazing game that you can spend as little as 5 minutes playing... or 5 hours. Can get difficult at times.
373	1	a	Game has a charming kitch to it. Still looks good, thanks to the 90s grung styling.
375	1	a	 Addictive game about sky diving. Nice visuals, good soundtrack, well made game mechanics in which you are getting points for gliding close to the buildings and objects.
86	0	a	Looked like a laugh and it kind of is for a short time, but it gets old fast despite the bragging of how many levels they have. If you like casual games and don't mind repetition or you love score chasing, you could do worse I guess. 5/10
377	1	a	6/5 stars. This game will absolutely destroy you in Oculus mode. Good luck, don't have a heart attack!
379	1	a	I've been having a really tough time of things lately, but this game brought a little joy into my life. It's FUN. There's some adult humour, but this is the kind of game I'll happily let my kids play. Sure beats Gears of Halo: Advanced Snorefare.
381	1	a	Great game with Oculus Rift.
383	1	a	 Title:  AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! for the Awesome  Genre:  Action, Indie, Sports  Developer:  Dejobaan Games, LLC   Publisher:  Dejobaan Games, LLC   Release Date:  3 Sep, 2009  Lets avoid those broken bones by not falling face first into a building, and remembering you have a parachute on your back.   Gameplay
385	1	a	sometimes i like to pretend im a astronaut who was spaced, and i wonder what my last thoughts would be as i burn up on re-entry.
387	1	a	 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRUwiwA51r0  Above is my video impressions of the game  AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! for the Awesome is an interesting game with some pretty simple mechanics. It's all about jumping off of buildings and accumulating as much points as possible. The game features a ton of levels and features to unlock, with some pretty eye catching aesthetics.  The game is simple and that is both it's strength and weakness. It's easy to jump into and will grab player's attention very quickly, but because of it's extremely simple design, it could possibly lose the player's interest just as fast. It's really upto you to decide whether or not the game is worth your money.  Pros: - Good looking - Easy to understand mechanics - Can be thrilling at times  Cons: - Overly simple - Might not hold the attention of some players
87	0	a	It gets tedious very fast. The levels get challenging, true, but you feel like you're always doing the same.
88	0	a	Clunky controls with a 360 controller, for this type of game I expected much more with this controller.
389	1	a	Not sure if it is worth full price but I had a lot of fun with this on my phone and on Steam. If you have an oculus rift this is a must have.
391	1	a	I bought this game as a simple collateral effect somewhere in the middle of a bundle, and let me tell you what, this was a great surprise for me, it simply took my inside it with magic, it dragged me with its visuals, soundtrack, intelligent humour, design and mechanics, I really enjoyed crossing ways with this game by accident, I would definely recommend it, it's base jumping futuristic distopic ambientation is awesome, and how I said before, the soundtrack drags you into every jump, and it's counter balance with the menu sounds enchanted me even more. Just go and jump with AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!! for the awesome =D
393	1	a	Such a fun game and a great edition to anyones libary. This game has so many good aspects and an amazing sense of humour, for example you can swear at the people that dislike you and give your fans a thumbs up!
395	1	a	This Game is absolutly amazing, it totally understands what it is trying to do and does it perfectly. The only question is do you understand what it is trying to do?  If you are wondering to yourself 'wait in these clips it seems like you could just go on the outside of these courses' the anwser is yes, yes you can. And have absolutly nothing in your way so you can master the movement without getting frustrated. Getting frustrated? THE GAME HAS A SOLUTION TO IT!!!!! It will go through breathing exersices with you to calm you down. This game does not take itself seriously it knows from moment 1 that it is made for fun and the challenge is there if you want it, but only if you want it.   This game has a huge varitety making me reccomend it to casual gamers and Hardcore gamers because you can progress from level to level fairly easily for casual but if you want to 5-Star every level it will give you a good challenge.  Getting the movement down to a useable level is really easilly but mastering it is really hard.   I absolutly love this game from start to just leaving it in your library for every-once-in-awhile play.
90	0	a	You go REALLY slowly, doesnt feel like there is much tension :/
397	1	a	This game is awesome. If you enjoy the concept, you're going to have a blast. If you don't, well, there's not a ton of variety in this game. It's a skydiving simulator set in a Tron world on acid by way of an infant subversive through and through. The controls are just tight enough to make it work and it gets pretty intense down the road.  The Oculus Rift support doesn't hurt, either. This'll be the first game I load up when mine finally arrives. Because I love puking, apparently.
399	1	a	I've booked quite a few hours playing this game over the last year. Great Game where you fall from the top of a building weaving between buildings, kissing and hugging them. you even get to flip people off to score points...lol. Tons of levels and replayability. Graphics are simple but work fine for the game and while I do not have own one it supports Occulus Rift....seriously sweet.  Dejobaan Games is my favorite Indy developer.  
401	1	a	While this game is a blast overall, it's even a greater experience in VR with its excellent Oculus Rift support since the days of the DK1, later adapted for the DK2 in full and updated regularly. I've actually gone as far as launching this game in VR during my work breaks. It's one of the best games to have a VR beginner try, as the feeling of falling is not only comfortable, but oddly relaxing and somewhat addicting over time.  A great, challenging concept overall. Excellent sense of humor. Driving sound tracks. Prime time VR support. Much safer than actually jumping off buildings in a wingsuit.
403	1	a	AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! ....For the Awesome, the Anti-Platformer!! In this game you will do all in your power to AVOID landing on them, as you leave every platform far behind!  I nearly made a mistake with this game (beyond thinking the dreadful title actually said something about the game, that is): I read the reviews. Then I read the awards it's won. Then I considered the type of games I enjoy most: pinball, Puddle, FOTONICA. Flowing, limited control type games. Actually, the decision was easier with more information. And I made the correct one.  WHAT a game! While some call it 'boring and repetitive' how can the possibilites of every building, tower, mountain in the UNIVERSE possibly be boring! People accustomed to absolute control, who have paid large sums to get games to perform in very precise ways, might not understand how gravity, and a body falling at very high speeds, are forces beyond simple control. They should play The Collider, a fine game with a similar basis. In THIS game you are being pulled by the force of an entire PLANET! Control must be earned, and learned....  Basically, after completing some ridulously simple tutorials you are given a building to leap from. On the way down you gain points by coming close to objects, coming VERY close to objects, hitting score-coded, colored glass plates, and not smashing to boney, bloody bits. By succeeding, and obtaining enough points, you will reach awards of 1 to 5 stars. Each star pays off in 'teeth', the currency used to unlock new levels, of which there are more than 80. Teeth can also be used to buy things like the 'flip-it' glove, to either give a thumbs-up to fans, or the opposite to haters. Yes, of course, granting additional points.   Once you have fallen as far as you feel is safe, a player opens their 'fins' in order to glide safely to a smooth landing, possibly on a high-scoring smaller target. All movement is performed by mouse and the ubiquitous WASD keys (or controller.) But one must keep in mind that despite the availability of directional keys, a falling/floating body will ultimately move forward, to the exclusion of most other directions or intentions. One quickly learns the power of 'spiraling'.  You may also unlock tongue-in-cheek 'relaxing meditations' (for significantly lower prices,) or (so far) a cookie recipe from the strangest old, pseudo-cannibal lady ever. The purpose of spending teeth is not just new levels and objects, but access to yet more, since you must unlock an adjacent level before opening a new one on a tall, turning 'level drum'. Prices increase with progression, and only hints are given as to what will be found once a choice is made.  There are also many bits of BASE jumping trivia, at no cost, basically to fill out he wall. A!FtA (for lack of better) does have achievements, but mostly for putting in the time, and only ten of them. Not a lot can be done to actively pursue them, other than sitting in a dark room, slowly wasting away. You know, the usual.  IF this is your game, it is VERY much your game. A marvelous, funny AND fun game. So much fun as to not provoke the rage tendancies that will cause me to 'delete local content' almost immediately. No two jumps are likely to be even remotely similar, since the distances fallen can be great. For me, it's almost as much fun to die as to win. Almost...  (Like many Steam games, offline game time is ignored.) 4tdc
91	0	a	I might just be terrible, but I don't find this game any entertaining at all. Sure, there's a bunch of content, it's challenging and scales well as you go through it, but I never really found it too entertaining. Not a big fan of how it looks, or the humor they're going for, or the way the menu works and looks.
405	1	a	'That's not flying, that's falling with style !'  -Sheriff Woody
92	0	a	this game look like it'd be fun if I had just did shrooms
407	1	a	Horribly annoying title but pretty damn fun game.   It makes me motion sick as it is though.  I wonder if a vr version of it would cause vast amounts of puking.
409	1	a	One of the acheivement descriptions is a paragraph long.  10/10
411	1	a	 I THREW...MYSELF...ON THE GROOOOUUUND !!!   This game is extremely fun, not much to say...you jump off stuff and fall trying to avoid stuff that will break you like the little insect that you are, while trying to stay close to said stuff...yeah...if base jumping/gliding feels stupidly dangerous to you IRL, you'll love this game because you can have a small fraction of that and the ability to do it again if you fall to your worthless death...pu*sy.  The music is great, the humor is good, I can't see why you wouldn't have fun with this title.  Play this game with a controller, or joystick.  I can only imagine how this game would feel on Occulus Rift...or even with a nice setup consisting of a good monitor/tv and a pro sound system :)
413	1	a	reminds me of my favorite levels of Pilotwings on the Super Nintendo.
415	1	a	...a great little idea, fun, in-your-face - really gives the sense that you're falling (and with VR support - impressive) - simple to pick up, difficult to master - a great points-scoring leaderboard climbing game... graphics are a little mucky, and it's best played with your own soundtrack (generic rock doesn't work with this I don't think) - but humorous and with plenty of content - still worthy of a purchase...
93	0	a	Do not buy this game.  Terrible UI Bad 'funny' menu screens and joke art direction Graphics are acceptable Gameplay is highly repetitive Music is irritating at times Game has a very 'good enough' indie effort  I would only suggest you buy this if: 1. You have the occulus rift 2. It is very cheap on sale (I paid $2.50, still not worth it)  5/10 would not play again.
94	0	a	Didn't play it for long: but the gameplay seems extremely repetitive, not that it is a surprise given the style fo the game but at the end of the day I get the sense that it would get old soon.   I would try it with oculus rift if I had one, it would be interesting/scary :)
417	1	a	Recently snagged this in a Bundle and AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! For The Awesome is stellar. Wow this game got a makeover and a kick in the pants on the speed and intensity factor since the original demo. I don't have an Oculus to fully enjoy this game but on the highest settings on the old monitor it still looks amazing. The random news bits that play during stage select, the silly videos that you can unlock and the soundtrack just keep the feel of this game going even when your not falling at the ground at terminal velocity.  Do yourself a favour and JOIN THE AWESOME.
419	1	a	This is a game that makes you think. It makes you think, 'HELP! I'M FALLING OUT OF THE SKY!' It's AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAAlright.  7/10
421	1	a	This game is a bit of an oddball title, but it's awesome. It's quite demanding in terms of attention, and death comes easily - however, I find myself trying again and again to succeed on those particularly hard levels, because this game is ultimately shedloads of fun.
423	1	a	This game with the Oculus Rift is absolutely horrifying and fun. I highly recommend it if you're looking for a simple time-drain... And I 100% recommend it if you are wanting something to play with the Oculus! It's such a darn good rift game!
425	1	a	A Puzzle game about a base jumping person. Or is it an adventure game. Or one of those arty farty indie 'life story' games about a suicidal person falling to their death and realising how thrilling life can really be when you do something spontanious. Cheered by the thrill of falling, and the daring of spraypaints and high fives from observers.   No idea.  What I do know is this game is a strange kind of fun. The idea is simple enough - fall from a great height and collect as many points as you can before you hit the bottom. Be daring and 'kiss' the lips of buildings, spray paint your logo wherever you can, wave to your fans are you plummett and make that soft landing. The more style you put into each trip to the bottom equals more money; more money equals more goodies and unlocks. Simples.  There's a strange sort of anti-oppression narrative tacked in there too, for those who seek reason for madness. However, it's a lot more fun to just pick up and play this game in small bursts. Long play throughs will probably lead to burn out. No joke.  That's not to say that this game doesn't have it's frustrating moments, but that's more to do with the game's levels and ramping difficulty rather than any ill-fated design decision or game breaking bug.   So, if you're looking for a 'pick up and play' kind of game that can fill a 10-20 minute gap here and there then I do believe 'AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! for the Awesome' could be the game you're looking for. It often goes cheap in the various Steam Sales too, so there's always that if you're really unsure about picking it up.
96	0	a	Too much repetitive. May be a good experience for those who like flying and speed, though.  3/10
97	0	a	Welcome to the first ever falling simulator that ive ever seen. I wouldnt recommend this game to anyone whos looking for a real good time but others may have a different opinion. For what you pay this game is very basic allowing you simply to fall while avoiding obsticles with the more risk you take earning you more points. You start with only a handful of maps to choose from but you have to earn points to spend unlocking other maps. This leads to alot of repetition just to allow yourself access to more repetition. The cost is made up for by the number of maps you can unlock as the game progresses but I dont find that to be all that worth it.
427	1	a	&gt;be me &gt;really bad at vidya  &gt;find this &gt;really good at it &gt;goes base jumping for real &gt;dies &gt;turns out VR was too stronk &gt;turns out really bad at vidya 10/10 would fall again
429	1	a	What the hell even is this game? 10/10
431	1	a	I CANT REVIEW THIS GAME!!! IM TO BUSY FALLING!!!! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!
433	1	a	This game is a gravity simulation. You jump off buildings and try to avoid getting killed by other buildings. You need to work your way through the maze of buildings (while getting as close to them as you can for points). Then you must land. Pretty fun. Has lots of obsticles but it gets boring after a while. You need great reaction time for this game. I would give it a 68/100.
98	0	a	AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA, why don't you accept my azerty control configuration!!!!  Seems like a nice concept, but totally unplayable as key configuration changes are not accepted by the game. :(
435	1	a	This game is absurd, let's start with that. The motivational speeches, the therapy, the hints ... all weird. But entertaining.  The game itself, the gameplay that is, is amusing and fun. But in short bursts. I enjoy booting this game for 15 minutes or so at a time, that way it doesn't start to bore me. It's still quite unique. :)  I recommend it when it's pretty cheap, or if you're able to get it from an indie bundle somewhere for nearly no money at all.
437	1	a	It takes a short while to get used to but this score-attack game absolutely clicked with me. The game really comes into its own once you have got competent at all the basics and played most of the basic mode levels then charge in to the 'awesome' mode which is much faster and honestly even more fun. Just like in real life, hugs and kisses are very moreish, and in the week I've been playing it I keep wanting to come back to it for about an hour at a time. Plus I keep getting amusing chat reactions to 'Gagaman is currently playing AaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!!' which is a bonus.
439	1	a	Ridiculously entertaining. Not deep, just a lot of fun and a good stress reliever.
441	1	a	Ridiculously entertaining. Not deep, just a lot of fun and a good stress reliever.
443	1	a	Really awesome and fun game where the player freefalls through an obstacle course and attempts to rack up as high a score as possible. Gain points by getting close to buildings, gesturing at spectators, and various other stunts. The highest scoring paths are usually the most risky, so be careful not to crash and die :) This is one of those concepts that is easy to learn, but difficult to master. There are endless hours of fun, trying to get high scores on over 100 maps. Graphics are simple but effective, and the music adds to the intensity. The low purchase price is great value for money.
100	0	a	A simple indie game about falling near things. I was bored by the concept very quickly, but YMMV. They made the menus fun and interesting, so it has a bit of style but (to me) no substance. I'm betting I got this as a title in a Humble Bundle - not sure anymore.
101	0	a	Gameplay: Controls feel awfully inaccurate, pretty bad for a game that is all about precision and speed. You fall down a couple hundrets predesigned levels in first person view and touch the walls or fall thru rings/squares for extra points. Nothing ever changes. Bored me real quick. Graphics: Ok for a small indie titly nothing really great tho.
102	0	a	Buy this if you think Microsoft Excel is too exciting for you.  Seriously, very sorry to say, but I think it's an absolutely horrendous game. Zero excitement. Zero. Bad graphics (worse than many cell phones today). Zero thrill. Insanely boring.   Gameplay goes like this:  -&gt; you walk (more like slowly inching your way) off a 'building'  -&gt; you 'fall' (more like slowly drift) towards something supposed to be downwards  -&gt; you steer clear of stuff (big blocks/pixels) on your way down, and try to hit various targets on the way down etc.  -&gt; you deploy your 'chute' (which is stated to be a helicopter-thingy?) and land  -&gt; repeat ad naseum.  No render of a ground or imminent dangers. Just blocks and stuff magically hovering in mid-air on your way down. No resemblance to an actual base-jump, or parachute-jump for that matter, whatsoever. You can unlock different places to 'jump'.   Why not make it go fast, like a real jump? Why not add the whooshing sound of air, or add the instability from the air resistance that rushing towards the ground gives you? Why no content or graphics? Why doesn't anything look like real buildings, or real persons, or anything real? I've tried countless games, in a broad spectre of genres, all the way from the Sinclair ZX and Commodore in the 80s, but this really burns itself on the retina and memory as a really, really bad gaming experience.  I will, however, not tell you how this game is with Oculus Rift, because I haven't tried it. Maybe it's better? Could be. Seriously, it could be. Maybe the VR-goggles can transform crap to tolerable.  Personally, I doubt it. But hey, each to his own.
445	1	a	YeeeEEEEEEeeeessSSSS! Can't wait to play this with the Oculus Rift....   The damn thing ALREADY has support for it....
110	0	a	gets really boring, really fast.
447	1	a	Suffering from bathophobia (fear of depth) I thought this game would make me sick to the stomach. Oddly enough it doesn't and I'm enjoying it quite a lot. Though I have played only 14 minutes when I'm writing this, I'm very happy I can actually play this game withouth my bathophobia bugging me in this game.
112	0	a	AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! for the Awful is what this game should have been called.
449	1	a	As I'm typing this review, I literally just realized that the 'A's' on the title aren't completely at random, they have a pattern. And that's pretty awesome. You know what else is awesome? This game.   'AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! for the Awesome' is a Base Jumping Simulator developed by Dejobaan Games and Owlchemy Labs, and it has an awesome sense of humor. You may have noticed how much I've used the word 'awesome' outside of the title. That's because it is the best word to describe this game. It's not beautiful, it's not revolutionary, it's not unforgettable, it's just awesome. You know the 'Awesome' smiley face that you see on the internet every once in a while? Yeah, that kind of awesome. But exactly why is this game awesome? Let's take a closer look.   First of all, this game has no story. At all. There is no main character; the game is in first-person so it looks like the person jumping is you! Why are you jumping? I don't know, because it's awesome, maybe? Is there some kind of hidden lore that I'm missing? Probably not, and if there is, it's VERY well hidden.   The presentation of this game is decent. There are no real characters in this game, meaning that there are no 3D models of any creature. So what we can judge is the buildings and structures that you'll be falling dangerously close to (or on to). The great majority of the shapes that you will see in this game are rather basic. Buildings are rectangles; there's some rings here and there; most platforms are squares; etc. Really, the most complex-looking model that you're going to see in this game are mountains. The textures are not impressive or super-detailed, either. The Heads-Up Display isn't anything spectacular or admiring to look at. And actually, it's OK for this game in particular to not look like it was made by Square Enix. Because you're constantly falling non-stop, you will never have time to take an in-depth look at all the objects in the levels. Honestly, it's better that way, because it won't distract you from trying not to fall to your doom. So in short, this game looks simplistic; it looks as good as it needs to look.   OK, here's the important one: the gameplay. In 'Aaaaa! for the Awesome' (that's the short way to say it), the goal is to jump off the building at which the levels starts you on and reach the bottom while making as many points as possible. In order to gain points, you must 'fly near stuff' as the game says, which will earn you 'Hugs' and 'Kisses.' Early on in the game, you will gain the ability to thumbs-up your fans, flip-off angry mobs, and spray municipal buildings with graffiti. A lot of levels also have breakable score plates and special plates that may or may not help you. The controls only consist of 4 keys on the keyboard and the mouse, and it does support a gamepad. But due to the game's simple controls, I don't find a gamepad necessary; the mouse and keyboard work just fine. Whenever you complete a level, you will gain a certain amount of Teeth and Kneecaps based on your score, and you can use these to unlock other levels. Now that I explained the gameplay, how enjoyable was it? Well, the game is fun. The slight feeling of vertigo that you get from falling thousands of meters in the air is pretty exciting. Despite how dangerous and realistically stupid of an idea it might be, you will always want to 'fly near stuff' as much as possible to ensure that you get the highest score, and for those who are competitive, you will probably try one level several times until you see 5 / 5 stars with a huge score sitting beside it. As you progress, the levels will become increasingly more challenging, though I don't believe the game ever got to a point where I just wanted to rip my hair off. But the game is not perfect, however. It is simple and easy-to-learn, but I personally didn't find 'Aaaaa! for the Awesome' to be noticeably addicting. If you want to beat the game in one sitting, you can probably do it in 3 - 4 hours, but it will start feeling repetitive and tedious after about an hour of playing. It's also worth noting that the game will not tell you your score until you finish or fail the level. But probably the biggest problem with this game is the lack of a level editor (at least there isn't one as far as I'm aware). The game offers 81 levels, and that's... sufficient, but I feel like this game could benefit SO much from User-Generated Content! I don't know if the developers are still willing to work with this game, but if they ever come back to it, please add a level editor. But as it stands, 'Aaaaa! for the Awesome' can be a fun game if played in short bursts, but I wouldn't advice binge playing it.   I guess let's talk about sound design for a bit. The game offers a techno-rock soundtrack that fits the general mood and style of the game, but it's not something that I may have a MIGHTY NEED to put on my MP3 player. There are actually a few pieces of voice acting in the game; the two you will hear the most is a man and a woman telling you how many Hugs and Kisses you have. There's also some videos narrated by the developers, and these videos will either be tutorials or talking about random things because yes. Oh, and let's not forget about Kevin... with the news. As far as sound effects go, I think they're mostly stock sounds of angry mobs, cheering, and hitting things. I do think they could have done a better job with those sound effects, particularly when you fall and break every bone in your body. The game tells you that you just broke everything, but it doesn't sound like it.   So all in all, what do I think about 'Aaaaa! for the Awesome?' It's definitely a fun game that does everything that it does good enough, but it's nothing mind-blowing. It knows what it wants to be, and tries to be nothing more. If you like awesome stuff, you'll like this game. And with the added support for Virtual Reality, it makes the game even better for those who own a VR device, though unfortunately that number isn't too high. Mind you, I'm a cheap booger, so I got this game from I believe a Humble Indie Bundle because I wouldn't pay $10 for it. But if you think this game is perfect for you (and specially if you own a VR device), go for it.
451	1	a	I don't have a oculus rift but this is fun!
453	1	a	This game is AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAAwesome. It's funny and oddly scary, just like the AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA! Reckless Disregard for Gravity. I mean, the name says it all really. Time well wasted.
114	0	a	Maybe this game just wasn't for me but I am usually pretty open minded about new types of experiences.  This one just wasn't very pleasing unfortunately, luckily I grabbed it cheap with a bundle.
115	0	a	It has an intense difficulty curve, gets boring quickly, and just flat out does not seem like the same caliber of game as many other ten dollar PC games. The mobile version is more enjoyable though.
116	0	a	It's a great game for Tablets and Smartphones, but as a Computer-Game it sucks.
455	1	a	 For more reviews and gameplay videos by Morgoth, check out the profile or the Twitch channel at  twitch.tv/morgoth0221 
457	1	a	There's a specific scene in Interstellar that made me think about this game, 10/10
459	1	a	Pretty dang fun. Stupid humor though, and definitely a 'standalone expansion cash grab that completely replaces the original,' so don't bother with Reckless Disregard if you get this.
461	1	a	In this game, all you do is fall. Fall and fall and fall. And yet, it's AWESOME BUY IT FOR YOUR FACE
463	1	a	This sure is a sexy game.  I r8 8/8.
120	0	a	I wouldn't reccomend that you buy this game
465	1	a	The greatest Arcade-style Sci-Fi Alternate History Base Jumping simulator since AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! - A Reckless Disregard for Gravity.  This may be due to the fact it contains all content from AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! A Reckless Disregard for Gravity, in addition to new 'Awesome' levels.  The 'Awesome' levels are legitimately Awesome. Just in case you were wondering.
467	1	a	This game is all about speed. If you've played the prequel, AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! a Reckless Disregard for Gravity, then you'll know what to expect. However, be warned, now you fall two times faster!  The original 83 levels are redone with brand new graphics and even more insane speeds. You will shout, you will scream, and you will curse as you die countless times, trying to get through the freaking level. Along with the original game's levels, there are more than 40 additional levels with brand new environments, making the world seem more realistic. The graphics are beautiful, the replayablility is insane, the gameplay is awesome, and the sound is fitting. However, there are a few low-res textures and hickups, so points must be taken for that.  Catagory Scores...  Graphics: A- Gameplay: A Sound: B+ Value: A+  Verdict: 'A' This is a must play...
469	1	a	The best game on Steam just got better!
471	1	a	Excellent. It´s a very quick and challenging game with a weird yet enjoyable sense of humour.
473	1	a	This game is fun and fast paced and I still find myself playing it. Definitly a must get. Its worth it to get the Dejobaan games fun pack with all their games in it. :)
475	1	a	So apparently this consists of the first AAAAA game plus a batch of 41 incredibly terrifying levels. And those 41... man, who depressed the ♥♥♥♥ out of the developers lately? At any rate it's an indication of the mood as it is in 2011. There's plenty to be moody about, honestly (or there was, depending on whether you're reading this from your manufactured Pleasure Dome.) Either way, cheer AAAAA up, why don't you?
477	1	a	Absolutely bursting with character. I wasn't sure whether I would enjoy this or not, but then I jumped off a building, and unlike in real life, where the end result is an unfortunate mess and a prime spot in the local obituary (or if you made a loud noise, the local paper front page), I found the whole experience to be absolutely thrilling.  It's a lovely example of a unique concept polished well, and given its own crazy personality to compliment the whole thing. Perfect little time waster, with some quite complex manouvres required for perfection, lending itself both to beginner building jumpers, and expert exo-base jumpers alike.  Really, there isn't quite a game like it, it's good.
479	1	a	Quite possibly the world's leading documentation on how to debristle a pig. Certainly the most thorough documentation in public circulation.   Also there seems to be some basejumping going on as well.
481	1	a	Well this game is neat I can't wait to tell all of my *barfs* ...friends
483	1	a	I really enjoyed this game. A lot of love went into it. The humor is right up my alley. The 'meditation' they included is a nice touch. Really can't say enough good about this one.
485	1	a	Quite a hilarious game, really enjoyed it to start out with but started to get a little boring the longer i played. But great to play in short bursts of like half an hour a day.
487	1	a	You jump the space, do the gestures and sometimes when you're good looking enough he whispers sweet nothings into your ear utrethras.
489	1	a	Really fun to play.
491	1	a	well. lets just say ♥♥♥♥♥. 
493	1	a	Such a fun and funny game. I imagine using an oculus rift would induce voiding of bowels though...
495	1	a	Every bone crushing, high flying, defiance of gravity that the first had but with more
497	1	a	I bought the game expecting nothing more than a few minutes of entertainment after which it would become unlikely that I'd ever play it again. I just wanted Steam prizes. I must say, I'm very happy I did buy it. This is one of the games I've had the most fun with in my life, and Dejobaan's unique flavor of humour just makes the game that much better. The levels are cleverly designed, as are the mechanics. It's a must-play!
499	1	a	Fantastic game, and probably the closest I'll ever get to a new Jumping Flash.
501	1	a	Picked this up as part of another bundle, but ended up being surprisingly fun in its own right.
503	1	a	Probably one of my favourite games of all time at first it appears to be just another indie game, so expecting a mediocre game that's only good for wasting the odd hour here and there  It's actually a supprisingly good game,  very simple, easy to get the hang of and not to mention extremely addictive, If you like your flashy graphics, and awesomely indepth storyline, this deffinitely isn't for you,  but if you just wanna waste your life away doing something utterly pointless but amazingly fun at the same time, this is deffinitely the way to go
505	1	a	Very good, and super addictive....but sometimes requires tighter controls than it has.
507	1	a	Its an awesome game to just chill and have some fun with
509	1	a	Let's pretend for a moment that you want to make a video game. Let's also pretend that you don't have any 3d modeling or artistic ability whatsoever. How do you resolve a conundrum like that? Simple: abstract art!  This is the approach that the developers of AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! for the Awesome took when developing their base jumping simulator. There's a certain edge to the game, certainly, and it's got some style, but I just can't get over the fact that it'd be a lot more fun if the buildings I was flying past at high speeds looked like actual buildings.  Also, the buildings float, because this is the future. And because this is the future, base jumping is obviously now the way that you're going to take down the evil authoritarian government that somehow took over. Presumably you're angry because of the flying buildings...who knows?  Still, it's fun for a bit as a sort of combination racing/puzzle game.
511	1	a	This is a very fun game, fast paced and designed with lots of different elements to keep things interesting. It's a great distraction because it is a good challenge, and it seems that there are hundreds of levels and since no two jumps are the same on any level, it is vast as well.
513	1	a	Great game, but the graphics settings are too simple. I am forced to play a pulled out 4:3 image on a 16:9 screen (Linux).
515	1	a	fun and funny, wish i had an oculus, does a good job of portraying speed and tension.
517	1	a	ya jump off of stuff super fast and its pretty awesome
519	1	a	This game is pretty good. You can fly through the colourful space while hitting/avoiding obstacles or you can watch some meditative videos instead. Aaaaand that's about it. Oh, and you can show your fingers to your fans.
521	1	a	This is probably one of the most satisfying and fun games I've ever played. WHY DO YOU NOT OWN IT YET!?
523	1	a	Enjoyable easy to pick up fun.   - Good if you want to pick up something to play for 5-10 minutes. - Has some unlockable videos that are amusing. - Might be extremely frustrating for people who need to 100% all their games, because getting 5 stars on every level is challenging. - Has an occulus rift mode(?). FYI for those who own one. 
525	1	a	AaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAAwesome! I've been waiting for a sale on this game, as I didn't know much about it. Now that I have purchased it, I can say this is just great! A Hidden gem of a game.  Now, if only I had an AAAAAAaaaaaCulous rift...  Will be getting for AAAAaaaaaAaaaAndroid aswell!
123	0	a	AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! for the Awesome played for 2 hours first impressions.  AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! for the Awesome is actually 2 games in one. The original game which is all the 'A's and the sequal which is called Awesome. It's a shame really as I was hoping to do a really crappy pun about the noise you will make when playing it. Actually it turns out that pun is pretty accurate as you will be saying both playing it :)  Before I start talking about this game I just want to let you guys know that I am not really the best person to talk about sports games. I don't really like sports and I tend to find the games equally as tedious. However there have been a couple of exceptions over the years and this is thankfully one of them. I think I've realised what it is now. The last sports game I really enjoyed was Mario Golf. I find Golf a bit of a mind blowing game, the only enjoyable thing I can think of is that its a nice walk on a pleasant day, but to watch it on tv is something I've never been able to understand, but like this game mario golf adds a lot of fun nice extras and it provides enough of a distraction. A for the A is similar. While you are jumping to possibly your death there are many things you can do. Your character will thumbs up any fans watching and make naughty gestures to those who protest, you get additional points for being a wreckless moron with a death wish by scraping your chin against buildings as you fall and you can spray graffiti too. Wait how does that even work? Never mind. You can also slam through glass plates for extra points. At the end you deploy your parachute and try to land in a small circle for bonus points which is a lot harder than it sounds as the parachute controlls terribly. Then you are graded, usually very poorly.  Holy crap is it hard though! You will find many hours of gameplay in this if its the kind of thing that you enjoy. I'm sure if you search youtube you will see people raging about it. You need to gain a high grade in order to gain teeth which is the in game currency to unlock the next level. However you only get teeth for gaining a better rank so there is a lot of grind. I have heard people complain that it is repetitive but it's a sporty game, of course its repetitive.   This game has a great sense of humour too, it is full of comedic parts and although a lot of it didn't work for me it's nice to see them there.  So after this positive review why am I not recommending it? Well...I feel bad for not doing so but the trouble is when I think about my friend circle, I can't think of anyone who would like it. It's something that I feel you should take a look at but it would require a lot of dedication to keep playing through it. The difficulty is incredibly high, and just because its hard doesn't make it negative is a rule I live by, but this is almost trapformer hard, I can see people getting really angry at it. It is kinda funny but it's a bit samey and the parachute controls will really wind you up. I understand why they made that part difficult but if you are falling for 4 5 maybe 6 minutes and you miss the circle by a pixel then you will be tearing your hair out.  I think this might be the sort of thing that works better on the tablet and indeed there is a tablet version, this seems to be the sort of thing you try and master slowly over several months while you are multitasking in the bathroom. This game feels a little bit in the wrong era. If we were still in the 'xtreme' 90s it may have fit in a little better. Of course if you enjoy base jumping in real life (you crazy madman!) then feel free to ignore all of this and play your heart out!  I see this game being absolutely perfect for its niche, like I say, the completionist extreme sports fan will gleefully be able to spend hours and hours maxing out everything this game has to offer, and good luck to him!  I bet its freaking awesome with the occulus though! If I ever get one I will promise to rewrite this review!
527	1	a	Base jumping is my new solitaire.  I'll give it this, there are a few minor bugs with control; but nothing that has been serious or irreperable so far. For the price, grab it!
124	0	a	It's ok.
529	1	a	awesome game ... falling simulator 8/10
127	0	a	Poor game. The best part was the headache I got.
531	1	a	If you like kissing buildings at Terminal Velocity this is the game for you.
533	1	a	It has its Up's and Down's.  Would jump again. 7/10
535	1	a	Only good with the oculus rift...    6/10
130	0	a	First of all I want to say as for an INDI Game thank GOD that this game came in a HumbleBundle and I didn’t have to pay for it. When I first looked at this game I though, oooo a free fall game might be cool but is like SLOW MOTION FALLING. To be honest I played it for about 5 minutes you might think, obviously not enough time to judge a game.   Well ♥♥♥♥ it the game is bad I give it 13/100.
537	1	a	I enjoyed the original a couple of years back and this is a great update (if at a small price).  HilaAaAarious humour. Major adrenaline rush. Lovely audio (sound and music). Overall a great quick bit of fun []^_^]
539	1	a	This is without a doubt the best bizarre technicolor arcadey falling simulator with graffiti that I've played.  10/10, 5 stars, 2 thumbs up, 4/4 apples, etc.
541	1	a	This is one of the most challenging, and fun indie-games I have ever played. Seriously makes me envious of people with an Occulus Rift, since this game runs Occulus Rift. Excellent game play, looks beautiful, great soundtrack, and it doesn't hold your hand one bit. Just shows you how the game works and thrusts you in!  The only gripe I have with it, is the parachute controls, since I have died many times trying to land by steering with the mouse, and then going off site and breaking every bone in my body.  Despite the parachute controls, this game controls flawlessly. I would highly recommend for any indie-game enthusiast, and even people who have wanted to base-jump.  10/10!
543	1	a	This game is just a great way to kill time and chill out. Fun gameplay, good music. The best pretend falling game I've ever played (1 of 1)
545	1	a	how did i end up with this cup of aids?
547	1	a	Offline I have more than 8h on this game.  I like this game because it is fast-paced and forces you to work out routes in advance. There are also many hidden pictures and messages that make this game pretty fun. Buy it on sale and have fun.
549	1	a	This is one of the most challenging, and fun indie-games I have ever played. Seriously makes me envious of people with an Occulus Rift, since this game runs Occulus Rift.

551	1	a	This is one of those games that is so funny/quirky that it's impossible to write a funny/quirky recommendation. Really all I can do is quote the game's intro:   'In the year of our Lord, nineteen eighty two, polystructures fell from space. Massive but light, they touched the atmosphere, and stuck.  Scientists made new materials. Builders made new cities. Families made their homes thousands of feet above ground level. Art made the floating super-sculptures, and culture made the floating caviar socials to regard them.  In the year of our Lord, twenty eleven, you cannot look up from beneath a city and see the stars.  But you can look down from above it. And you can jump.  The jumps you make are not about art. They are about a reckless disregard for safety.  The jumps you make are not about culture. They are about a reckless disregard for regulation.  The jumps you make are not about science. They are about a reckless disregard for gravity.'  And that's the least nutty part of the game.
553	1	a	The levels from the first game are beautifully remastered. One of my favorite twitch games of all time. Get it! It's awesome~
555	1	a	Even though Im not good at this game I love it!! Its got a whimiscal take on those first Skydiving games on older phones, pre smartphone not old smartphones, where you had to fall through hoops to get points. Here you get to fall through flosting buildings, weave in and out of tight spots, and then land. The gameplay is lots of fun and the movement controls are a bit slow, I kind of wish they could be a litle more crisp especially for weaving through the tight spots, but the game was designed to emulate skydiving, so its not really a big surprise.   Pros: Simple controls; Its a fun game  Cons: The movement feels slow to me, but i am NOT good at this game;  For me this game is really fun i would recommend buying this game on sale as 10$ is a little pricey in my books for this kind of game, but then again i am a pretty frugal person, but this game is totally worth a look when its on sale, since you can usually get all of Dejoban games in a collection for super cheap.
557	1	a	This game saved me from eating my hard-drive
559	1	a	This game is a lot like a Saturday morning cartoon in the sense that it's just senseless fun.  It works really with VR (Oculus Rift DK1 and DK2) and is quite fun in a consumable kind of way, constantly offering incentive to play by having stages unlocked based on performance.   It's fun.
132	0	a	Virtualized base jumping...not much more to it than that.
561	1	a	Kinda of like BASE jumping, after eating a few peyote buttons...
133	0	a	Getting all the achievements in this made me want to jump off a building.
563	1	a	i love this game..
565	1	a	Fun game, brings back memories. But funny this as soon as I instal it, my pc is full of 'OffersWizard' adverts! I know and saw myself that the steam page was all clean, until after installing and palying this game it now had adverts everywhere... OffersWizard!? AAAaaaaAAAAaaaaAAAA!!!! 'I'v fixed it now, but still WTF?'
567	1	a	  I am touching your face now.
569	1	a	As an owner of the Oculus DK2, I actually whole heartily support this game. It runs perfectly on it, something few games ever achieve.   Beyond that? If you enjoy twitch reactions, and the occasional shattered foot, then offer your tithe to our Earthly Lord Gaben.  Praise his name from the skies. Praise his name.
571	1	a	Do you like falling? I like falling.  you dont fall in this game, tho. buy it anyway.
573	1	a	Recommended !
140	0	a	Bad Game. Not worth any money.
141	0	a	waste of diskspace
142	0	a	As far as base jumping games go I can't complain. 10/10
143	0	a	Opera music. In game contro guides written for keyboard meanwhile I'm using a controller. More opera music. Get out.
144	0	a	This game is definatley AAAAAAAAAaaaaaaAAAAAmazing!!!! (not)
145	0	a	Boring
146	0	a	the games sense of humor is immmature and stupid. its difficult and way less fun than i expected
147	0	a	This game is horrible  
148	0	a	DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! the only reason I didn't refund this game is so I could write a review for it. This is the worst game on the face of the planet. The bugs are so bad you can't even play it. So... ♥♥♥♥ing... bad... This is the first bad review I've done and I will change if the dev's fix it. Have posted on forums, with other people joining in having similar, stupid ♥♥♥ issues. At first the devs made a joke about it, then they said they're working on it... a month and a half later nothing. Crap developers making crappy games that shouldn't be on steam. Anyone who posts a positive review of this game is a complete ♥♥♥♥ing moron.   http://steamcommunity.com/app/15560/discussions/0/616189106706421199/   And the link they removed is to the steam discussion I had with the problems that they can't or refuse to fix. Ya... real professinal. Anything that doesn't look good for them, censor all they can. Look up mouse sensitivity and input issues in the forums. Don't let them hide behind lies. Oh and all the comments on this, and people rating negative reviews as unhelpful, it's all the company's cronies doing it. Scam upon scandal. Be wary
149	0	a	I received this off humble bundle. It's a very interesting game.   Basically, the game simulates you falling off a building, and you have to make it to your target without hitting other parts of the building. To be honest, I found the game quite offensive due to the nature of falling out of buildings. I felt really scared once I jumped off and I thought it was real for a second.   I don't recommend this game if you have vertigo, which I have.   I rate it 9 out of 11.
150	0	a	It's fun but not funny, although it tries to be. The gameplay is as repetitive as gameplay can get, but somewhat satisfying for a round or two at a time. Keep in mind, this is one of those games where you keep doing exactly the same thing over and over again in hopes of getting a better highscore. This is attractive to many, but a no-go for others. I would not buy it at full price, but if you find it heavily discounted or as part of a bundle, play it.
575	1	a	Awesome arcade style game, That challenges you, and gets you rather pumped. Story is absolutely non-existent, but who cares. This game is about jumping off buldings, scoring mass points, and just being... well, awesome. Definately worth a look if youre looking for a fun game to pass a short time span.   Loading times could be improved, but then again, I didnt install it onto my SSD.
577	1	a	Just got my welfare. This is the best game ever!
151	0	a	It's a great soundtrack- but its also a ♥♥♥♥ game. It's a great dea- but there was such poor and immature execution on the dev's part that it was just sad. They tried to add humour into their game- but like I said earlier it just bombed.
579	1	a	This is probably one of the weirdest games I've ever heard of and played before. But, believe it or not, it's not half bad! It depends on what your mood is and what type of games you like and how serious you are, but it's not a BAD game. I was actually quite surprised when I traded some crap TF2 items for this to find out it was actually a nice and enjoyable game! I mean it's not the BEST game, but I could definately spend an hour sitting and constant playing!  7.5/10
581	1	a	First-person basejumping fun. Humour and fast gameplay make up for the complete lack of narrative or progression. Tense and rewarding, with the added bonus of scoreboards for highscore-o-files.
583	1	a	I like the simple, 'flow like', concept of this game. However, it never really grabbed me. BUT then I tried it with VR where it is a really great experience. It looks like it should be scary/sickening, but it isn't, it just thrilling. The developers have done a great job with the VR port - it is one of the best available at the moment.
585	1	a	This version has old remastered levels from the original and bunch of new ones. Gameplay is pretty the same. I recommend to get this version of the game. Falling down is fun. Overall Rating: 8.5/10.0
587	1	a	So this isn't really a huge leap from the previous one as far as I can tell. Take it with a grain of salt, I only played just a few minutes and didn't feel like I needed to delve too far into it. The biggest improvement I could see was the hit box was shrunk and VR support was added. How many of you actually have a VR device yet? Exactly, neither does anyone else. But the hitbox improvement means you can really thread the needle that much better.  Much of the look is the same though: menus, geometry, effects, pretty much everything. The only difference here is what appears to be newer and more interesting shaders. All-in-all, it's the same as before, and that's a little disappointing. I still recommend it because at it's core, it's fun. However, if you already bought the first one, you might want to wait for this one on sale, or just skip it altogether (unless you really want that VR support). If you didn't get the first one, then this is an easy buy.
589	1	a	This game's really good. Now you may be saying, 'WHY IS THIS?!?!?!', and to that I say 'JEEEEEZUS!' and also the fact that it just is. Maybe it's just that I'm adjusted to flinging myself and my co-workers off of buildings, but it's fun. Now...... I don't know... play..... viju gayms?
591	1	a	10/10 vertigo simulator  You know that feeling when you look over a ledge where you think 'What if I just jumped right now?' This game is that feeling. Except with slightly more falling.
593	1	a	Great VR game, really nails the falling. Best played standing up with a controller.
595	1	a	Too much fun. I didn't like this game at first but have recently given it another chance, and it's seriously fun to jump off buildings trying to smash into money, kiss the side of buildings, hug them for more points, or just flip off the crowds against you. And get points for doing all of that.   Good game, I recommend it.
597	1	a	a new addiction. these dejobaan cats really know how to make a game- first drunken robot pornography, now this!
599	1	a	If you have a penchant for jumping off things, this game is worth every adrenaline wrenching cent.  It indeed lives up to its name.
601	1	a	This game features some of the greatest level design I've personally seen. It's also incredibly fast paced and fun. The redesigned levels are excellent, but what really shines are the new levels, all of which are specifically made to be faster than a bullet. 10/10.
603	1	a	If you like to laugh in the face of gravity and break all your bones while doing it, this is the game for you.
605	1	a	This game is digital adrenaline, so much fun!
607	1	a	this game = crack
609	1	a	This game is awesome, just like it says. It's an adrenaline rush, and it's stupidly fun. It's completely random at times, but the actual gameplay has stunning graphics and great background music. So far no bugs. The controls are fairly good, sometimes they can be tricky when you have to wasd-ctrl-leftclick-rightclick-space all at once, but that doesn't come up often enough to be annoying. Just enough to be challenging. Don't take it too seriously, get past the tutorials and into the fun. Should bear a motion-sickness and epilepsy warning though. Also, turn down the volume before you start, or you might get a nice headphone-blast in the beginning. Totally worth it. I have no regrets.
611	1	a	This game is not too demanding in terms of PC requirements, it also gives you a sense of thrill even without the oculus. but with the rift, you'll just have to scream AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!!
613	1	a	Funny and fun. I would recommend.
615	1	a	Well, it's a really funny game which could really make you spend a lot of time playing it. The idea is simple but quite entertaining in some ways. I recommend it but not at current price (6,99 €). I bought it at a discounted sale so...maybe you find another and enjoy this game too!
617	1	a	Fun, irreverant, and a little crazy. It's a game about falling and flipping off the people who hate you while doing it. The soundtrack is awesome, and the mechanics are fun. The videos are... well let's say they're weird as hell, considering there's a recipe for cookies made from ashes of dead jumpers such as yourself.  Seriously, though, I can't recommend this game by Dejobaan games enough!
619	1	a	An exhilarating (and often fatal) game that you'll probably have fun with. Even as you smash into things at less-than-safe speeds over, and over, and over again &gt;:D
621	1	a	If you have the original AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! and really want a few more difficult levels, stop reading and get this game. You can even transfer your old save so you won't lose any records.   If you're new to AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!!, it's a game about skydiving off buildings, staying close to buildings as you're falling to collect points, but also trying not to die. You unlock a few neat items like spray cans (bonus points if you tag municipal buildings), coffee (temporary time slowdown), a glove (points if you thumbs-up fans and flip off protesters).   It's a game that kills you for running into things but gives you points for style which requires you to get really close to running into things.   The devs have an odd sense of humor (it seems like a few of the levels are based on in-jokes, one of which is actually explained in an unlockable bonus video). If you're familiar with other Dejobaan Games works, this has the same general tone.  The level system is a bit annoying. Unlock new levels by spending in-game currency, and you only get in-game currency by matching or beating records on previous levels. If you buy levels in the wrong order, you'll find yourself unable to continue because you can't meet the score requirement on the levels you bought and the only 'adjacent' unbought levels are pricey.  In theory you would continuously get better at the game to continue, but in practice it means you're farming easy to medium difficulty levels to squeeze out the last couple points you can. Also, the theme of levels is mostly totally unconnected which means that some levels require entirely different sets of skills (dodging a lot in tight corridors vs. wide open spaces with few point-scoring objects you have to fly to).   However, the levels themselves are well-designed and unique enough to be entertaining, and the fast-paced arcade-style falling mechanic feels really fluid.   One other thing the game has going for it is the art style. It's bright and colorful and in-your-face, which fits with the gameplay seamlessly (though some might find it a bit over-the-top).   Ultimately, watch a video of the gameplay and imagine about 100 levels designed around the same central theme.  If you can get it as part of a bundle or on sale, it's definitely worth it.   If you like the fast-paced feeling of rhythm or racing games and enjoy arcade-style skill-based point collecting, this is definitely for you.
623	1	a	It'll make your ears sneeze.
625	1	a	came in a bundle  very nice music and can be quite entertaining trying to get a neat little score this is just one of those games you just pick and play for about ten minutes, or maybe an hour put away, for a couple a weeks, dust off and jump a few more times to your death  ps the controls come to you over time...
627	1	a	Awesome arcade style game, That challenges you, and gets you rather pumped. Story is absolutely non-existent, but who cares. This game is about jumping off buldings, scoring mass points, and just being... well, awesome. Definately worth a look if youre looking for a fun game to pass a short time span.   Loading times could be improved, but then again, I didnt install it onto my SSD.
629	1	a	Fun and challenging if you take the time to progress. It gets a little repetative after a while but if you like kind of a reverse platformer its for you. 7/10.
631	1	a	I thought it was a pretty nice audio synth game. It was pretty good to sit down, chill, grab a drink and play. Very casual, and kept my attention. Pretty great casual game to hang chill with your buds or by yourself.
633	1	a	Thrilling, challenging, more than a little insane.
635	1	a	AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! for the Awesome in my opinion was a fun game. The basics of the game is to jump off buildings and score as much points as you can by falling as close to objects as you can and going near as many different objects as you can. They slowly add more mechanics throughout the game like tagging government buildings, giving thumbs up and fans and the middle finger to protestors, and activating a coffee mode where things slow down for a brief moment.  The original levels are enjoyable for a bit but I found myself starting to be burned out by them once they were almost all done. The game was just starting to feel stale and repetitve. Finally i grinded through the last of the original levels and started with the 'Awesome' levels. The awesome levels restored my faith and enjoyment in the game. The game was a lot faster and certain levels added a checkpoint system. The 'Awesome' levels also have a hard to follow storyline. After completing a level you will hear a broadcast message if you listen to them all the final one will be about you 'Player one' help support an uprising for supporting base jumping.  All and all I had a fun time with this game for the most part and I would reccomend it people who are on the fense about buying it.
637	1	a	100% good fun game very simple and fun for when you dont want to play any more fps games or when you dont want to watch the crap on TV or you have nothin to do. this game will realy stop you from getting bored
639	1	a	Super fun game. Awesome VR experience. Unprecedented dev support.  Buy it, enjoy it and support the devs, they deserve it.
641	1	a	A good game to have on in the background of a Skype call or for a Twitch chill stream: perfect mix of chill and focus. It's essentially CS surfing plus TF rocketjumping minus your keyboard. Nice deal.
643	1	a	An adequate follow up to A Reckless Disregard for Gravity, but not enough new material to be an actual sequel.  It feels more like an expansion, but it too wears thin as the original did. If you liked the original, you'll probably enjoy this.
157	0	a	Strange gameplay. I do not really see the point in playing this game.
645	1	a	The ultimate anti-platformer. BASE jump through floating futuristic cities and try not to splat against anything on the way down!  The idea with this game is not to play it for long periods of time. Five to ten minutes is generally all you need to feel satisfied with it for quite some time. Once that happens, put the game away for a while. Play it too long, and you start driving it into the ground (pun intended).  'AaaaaAAaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!!' is great as a hot-seat game, too. You'll love it.
647	1	a	I give it an A.
649	1	a	Pretty fun once you get the hang of it.
651	1	a	Fun base jumping! Recommended for a fast fix. ;-)
653	1	a	AaaaaAAaaaAAAAaaaAAAA!!! I bought the wrong AAAAAAAAAaaaAAaAAAaaaaAAA! at first. Bought everything just to show love, this is a great game.
655	1	a	I really like humor of this game in text and pictures. I'd love to try it in VR set, I guess, it should be awesome.
160	0	a	AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! Rather boring. Humble Bundle ftw.
161	0	a	Um not really that great of a game. Not sure what the point of falling and falling is. Didn't play for that long but not my cup of tea so to speak. Maybe for someone else.
657	1	a	Gonna keep it simple.  Pros: High speed. Oculus Rift support. Incredibly satisfying.  Plenty of content. Neutral: Soundtrack is amazing hits and terrible misses. Looks awful, but it's meant for VR, so it gets a pass. Cons: Humor is mostly cringy meme stuff, not to say it sometimes provokes some very good chuckles. Beginning is slow and isn't fun.  Overall, worth it's base price.
659	1	a	Fantastic. Must own for anyone with a Rift!
661	1	a	Heh. What a trip.
663	1	a	Skydiving with AWESOME AWEEEESSSOOOMMEEE soundtracks and very beautiful visuals.
665	1	a	Just got my welfare. This is the best game ever!
667	1	a	This game is Awesome!
669	1	a	AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! For The Awesome holds the record for longest game title. All joking aside, this is a game about jumping off of buildings. (Im serious) You have to get the highest score you can by flying close to buildings and making your descent as creative as possible, all while trying not to die at the same time. This game gives you a rush of excitement and adrenaline as you descend between and around other buildings while at the same time playing a rocking soundtrack. Don't worry about a shortage of levels, there are tons! I'm not sure if this has oculous support (not that I have one at the moment), but if it does, this is THE game for oculous. Just try not to throw up. 10/10 would suicide again. Very fun.
671	1	a	Well, now that it doesn't support the Consumer Version 1 or any runtime past .6, like I don't really have too much of a point to play it. The game itself isn't bad though. I don't recommend it for anyone that heard it supports VR because at this point unless you have a DK1 it doesn't.  I do recommend it for non-VR users though.
673	1	a	There isn't much to say about this game. It's essentially a sky diving simulator mixed with some Tony Hawk. If you see it on sale, give it a try, it's a good way to kill a couple of hours.
675	1	a	Pretty Awesome Game. It has good music and is visually stimulating. It's not hard to pass the levels, but there is always room from improvement making the replay value of this game good. It's fun to play with a friend or two and take turns trying to get the highest score. For $10 it's definitely worth it.
677	1	a	jump off buildings and flipp off paparazzi. It's okay I guess. Very repetitive.
679	1	a	The best falling simulator I've ever played. Pretty fun indie title.
681	1	a	Buzz Lightyear Simulator with Rad Extreme 90s Rock music.  10/10 Fallings with Style.  Would drop again.
683	1	a	Weirdly wonderful. Everyone should give it a try.
685	1	a	You get points for flipping people off.  10/10
687	1	a	But your VR-goggles on and ge crazyyyyyy! Love this game! It's just to much fun if you have VR.
689	1	a	It's rare for a game to be so thrilling and so easy to pick up. It's fast pace means you quickly re-enter the game to give it another shot, and it's scoring system means you can approach each level at your own pace. During really well however is both challanging and super rewarding, somehow translating the serious thrill of base jumping without the petty concern of safety.
167	0	a	Not bad but gets repetitive real quick. I'd give it a neutral rating if I could.
168	0	a	This is a game that has a really neat mechanic and idea, but doesn't have the sort of gameplay that keeps me engaged for very long. After playing it for 20 minutes, I feel like I won't get much more out of it. What it does do, it does very well. Maybe try before you buy.
169	0	a	How do I keep on ending up with these games... ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥it Gabe.
691	1	a	Its pretty great
693	1	a	If you like a non-serious game buy it. It can get a bit the samey though,over all a fun tiale.
695	1	a	Thrilling, challenging, more than a little insane.
697	1	a	100% good fun game very simple and fun for when you dont want to play any more fps games or when you dont want to watch the crap on TV or you have nothin to do. this game will realy stop you from getting bored
172	0	a	NOT XBOX 360 controller friendly NOT left-handed friendly NOT acutrate NOT intuitive at all 
699	1	a	Gonna buy an Oculus for this game. 10/10
701	1	a	The wonderfully titled title returns with new levels and massively improved eye-candy, worth buying even if you got it first time around. Can import the previous save data!
703	1	a	The name says it all!
705	1	a	Bargain-priced title with plenty of content, a lot of excitement, and a satisfyingly high yet not-frustrating difficulty level. Buy this if you like speed and challenge in your games.
707	1	a	AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! for the Awesome in my opinion was a fun game. The basics of the game is to jump off buildings and score as much points as you can by falling as close to objects as you can and going near as many different objects as you can. They slowly add more mechanics throughout the game like tagging government buildings, giving thumbs up and fans and the middle finger to protestors, and activating a coffee mode where things slow down for a brief moment.  The original levels are enjoyable for a bit but I found myself starting to be burned out by them once they were almost all done. The game was just starting to feel stale and repetitve. Finally i grinded through the last of the original levels and started with the 'Awesome' levels. The awesome levels restored my faith and enjoyment in the game. The game was a lot faster and certain levels added a checkpoint system. The 'Awesome' levels also have a hard to follow storyline. After completing a level you will hear a broadcast message if you listen to them all the final one will be about you 'Player one' help support an uprising for supporting base jumping.  All and all I had a fun time with this game for the most part and I would reccomend it people who are on the fense about buying it.
173	0	a	It's passable, and I'm sure awesome in Oculus Rift, but as a game for keys/mouse or controller, it's WAY too loose and jittery. Felt like O.R novelty software, like Playstation PLAY games were for the Eyetoy.
709	1	a	its a fun game to play for 30 minutes here and there
711	1	a	Awesome game with an interesting concept. The levels progress in complexity nicely and have varying looks and styles despite using almost always the same building blocks from one to another. The audio feedback system is probably my favorite aspect of the game though since it allows you to focus on trying to get the best run possible without looking at a crowded HUD. I just wish I had an occulus rift to try this game out in VR.
713	1	a	Bargain-priced title with plenty of content, a lot of excitement, and a satisfyingly high yet not-frustrating difficulty level. Buy this if you like speed and challenge in your games.
715	1	a	Gonna buy an Oculus for this game. 10/10
717	1	a	This game really should come with a 'do not try this at home' warning. ~12:02 PM ShadowDialga tweeted from Los Angeles County General Hospital
719	1	a	If you want to learn about this game this video is only gameplay footage and will tell/show you everything you need to know about it. It's basically a look at what you'll be playing and takes out all the reviewer fluff that they like to throw in.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GevkSwXpqfU&amp;index=6&amp;list=PLbmOuMgQ8Co6Zf-nLedxXUL8f6Myxs7MY 
174	0	a	This is probably much more fun if you have an Oculus Rift, but like the other reviews have said, it gets repetitive really fast.
721	1	a	This game is digital adrenaline, so much fun!
723	1	a	Really fun game. I payed like a dollar when it was on a Humble Bundle and this games music is so cool. Everybody should have this in their library. The game is fun and alittle pricey but still well worth it.
725	1	a	The best falling simulator I've ever played. Pretty fun indie title.
727	1	a	Buzz Lightyear Simulator with Rad Extreme 90s Rock music.  10/10 Fallings with Style.  Would drop again.
729	1	a	Weirdly wonderful. Everyone should give it a try.
731	1	a	Little clever game where you fall down just to not hit any floating platforms... And flip off your haters. It has tons of levels (not really) and you can have endless hours of fun doing them (not really). Levels are more or less score based, which is mostly gained by basically flying (well, falling) near those floating platforms. Well, what can I say, if it sounds fun, get it!  Lil' Sucky Gameplay to go with the review.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AY5frBlPxQ 
733	1	a	Fun and cheap game. Unusual strange kind of satisfaction from 'falling.'  Has some bizzare stuff ingame too. Don't want to post any spoilers though.. so I won't. Unlockable levels go from easy to difficult. It would be nice to have an option to have all levels unlocked from get-go. They are not hard to unlock but I am one of those people who like going straight to the crazy difficulty levels.  Summary: Fun, skill oriented game. Recommended to those who like fast paced games.
735	1	a	Kinda boring, but it passes the time.
737	1	a	Like and AaAAa 1.5, with all the old levels plus half as many new (and more awesome) ones, but it's also got fancier graphics, controller support, and the ability to transfer your data over from the original game, so if you're an AaAaa! Fan, get this, and if you haven't played the original, just skip that and get this one instead.
739	1	a	I know some people are going to think I'm crazy, but this is a pretty good game. Normally, Dejobaan games aren't really all that good (to put it nicely), but AAAAA manages to not suck. Its gameplay is very simple; fall down a floating city, collecting points and buzzing towers for bonuses, and trying to land without breaking all your bones. More complexities are added, like bystanders and tagging certain buildings, but it never becomes too complicated to enjoy. It's dumb, it's simple, and it's good for just zoning out and playing something. I'd recommend getting this on sale, but you should definitely check it out.
741	1	a	A neurotic falling game.   Be sure to slide alongside the buildings on the way down for extra points...  (Note: Acquired via a bundle)
743	1	a	One of the best implementations of a short game for the rift, the levels can seem pretty similar after a bit, and too bad there is not more absolutely crazy impossible levels, but none the less I love this.
176	0	a	Hmm hmm. What to say about this game. The negative is basically meaningless 'cause I'm just really 'meh' on this one. I don't hate it and it can be entertaining but it's not that compelling or deep and rather reptetive after a while.  The visuals are kind of bland, for one. Funny, right, unique, but still very bland. I liked Drunken Robot Pornography's aesthetic a lot, but this game is just not as interesting visually. Musically the songs are all okay I guess? I guess. There's basically no plot except for a radio announcer guy who I ignored after the fourth or so time he appeared because just kidding there's no plot. Yeah, ehh.  The gameplay itself is a more arcade-y score-attack type of thing, which is fine, but not my kind of gameplay. I'd rather the game be about completing hard levels than completing a lot of easy-to-average levels really well. Progressing in the game isn't hard but I have no drive to sink in the time it would take to 5* everything, at all. The controls tend to be decent enough though a bit sluggish-feeling, and the parachute mechanic is kind of trash, but it's all fine on a basic level. There's just too much of it with too little variety. I didn't even finish the main game levels (all the added ones though, which at least were decently interesting and more varied).  I mean yeah, if that kind if gameplay is your thing, go for it I'd say. It's not really my thing. So I can't review it positively. EHH.
177	0	a	I just could NOT get into this game. The name of the game really attracted my attention, but the gameplay and mechanics just aren't there for me. Some people may like this game...but there are much better 'twitch' style games out there. Its a decent attempt though! Same applies for their other three that are nearly identical.
745	1	a	Amazing beautiul unique awesome game. really makes you go AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! while playing the game, whether out loud or in your head - it's that intense
747	1	a	Fast, awesome base jumping.   There's not much more to it, but it's addictive. In one line with great games like Mario and Super Hexagon.   Def recommend!
178	0	a	Pretty fun game. It is a novel idea of base jumping, and the game is certainly not easy, but the levels are tough in a fun way. The developers released some new free levels, and the opening message about the developers changing every time was funny and original, plus you gotta love the owl for the symbol. There is a lot of fun to be had while flying down at amazing speeds narrowly missing things and fitting into tight holes (yes, that's what she said, I know you were thinking it). It has that exhilirating feeling when you go so fast you can barely keep up, you sometimes get the actual feeling with a little feeling in your stomach that sometimes goes into your ♥♥♥♥/balls (guys you know what I'm talking about).   So why am I giving the game a down vote, for a few reasons. First off, although the idea is fun at first, it can be very repetitive because you literally just base jump for the entirety of the game, which isn't that short. It can start to become mundane because you're doing the same thing for the 100th time. Also, most levels are the exact same, with the same buildings and obstacles. More variety of where you are jumping would be nice. There are a few with rocks and a mountain, as well as a giant pipe, but for the most part the levels were interchangeable, which doesn't help with the repetition. More thought could have been put into level design. Also the few things that can add something to do (tagging buildings and giving thumb signals) stay the same throughout, so even after they are introduced in the first few levels, you never gain anything else to do, which once again adds to the monotony. Some other things to do would be nice. Also the tagging and thumb signals aren't very accurate and you can look at things and press the button and it won't count, and the game doesn't give you a good enough indication whether or not you actually got it. They are a little too finnicky sometimes, and could have been polished more.  Now for the worst problem. Although I am fine with having high scores and points, it should be for people that want to get leaderboards and want to replay a game. In this game, your star rating gets you stuff you have to use to unlock levels. This is fine for a while but then newer levels cost more than if you get a 5 star on a single level, which makes no sense. I got mostly 4-5 stars on all the levels, with some 3s, and only a very few 1-2s, and I couldnt afford to play about 10 levels. It seems so stupid that a developer would make something and make it soo inaccessible. You should not be decided to play more of the game based on a random score or time the developer chooses for you. That is what the leaderboards and other things are for the idiots that wanna keep replaying a level to get as high of a score as possible. I don't want to have to keep repeating every level till I get 5 stars just to be able to play more, because if thats the case then why include 1-4 stars, it's just stupid. FORCED did it too with challenges and SMB did it with secret hidding bandages and level speed run times. It is such a dumb and lazy concept used to force replay value on those that don't want it. They fix it with the added hard levels (what does it say that hard levels it the value you get and cost of new levels is MORE fair and balanced than regular levels). There are a ton of levels though, so good for them. But since I cannot finish the game because of stupid game design I cannot fully endorse the game. 5.5/10.
179	0	a	Not interesting game! The name of the game itself in steam library makes me crazy!
749	1	a	An interesting idea for a game, fun and lots of content.
751	1	a	Fantastic. Must own for anyone with a Rift!
753	1	a	Fun game, didn't hold a lot of lasting appeal, but definitely interesting concepts.
755	1	a	Holy ♥♥♥♥ I'm Gonna Die Simulator
182	0	a	An incredibly cool experience...for the first ten minutes. I loved how original the whole concept was. However, the appeal was quickly lost. I think the biggest drawback for me was that the whole graphics scheme was SO COOL but I think its just a bit outdated.   The menus were another let down. I would have enjoyed something slightly more linear or maybe just something a bit more organized. That coupled with a bit of repetition was enough for me to lose interest.   I personally wouldnt recommend it.
757	1	a	2nd Verse same as the 1st....but with MORE levels, another well rounded soundtrack and beautiful new challenging levels that make you say...'COME ON DAMNIT I HAD THAT...I FREAKING HAD THAT.'  (From 1st Game) This surprisingly simple game decieves you...it lures you in 'Come play me,' it says 'Only for a few minutes it won't take long.'...8 hours later you have blisters, have slammed your face against buildings countless times. Gotten one or two '5' star levels and are swearing that JUST ONE MORE TRY and you'll BEAT THIS ONE LEVEL.  ....the music is to die for by the way, I WISH I could buy the OST.
759	1	a	This game is really great with the oculus rift dk2 and surprisingly a whole lot easier to control as opposed to playing it without VR. The problem is that it hasn't been updated to work with the latest rift runtime yet. I fortunately have a secondary computer with win7 and have runtime 0.6 on it but not everyone who has a dk2 will have that option.  I'm giving this a thumbs up and I recommend only if you have a DK2 with runtime 0.6 or if the developers update to run on 0.7+ If you don't have a vr set I recommend this when it's on sale. It's a descent game that will keep you entertained if played for a few minutes a session.
185	0	a	Calling this game hard or fun is fairly stupid, I had more fun kick flipping my wife's corpse off the roof of my house... Not nearly as repetitive, and no where near as slow...  Oh no, I have fallen and I can't keep it up/10
761	1	a	This game is a real blast. I mean it really gives you that edge of your seat feeling to it. Trying to hug walls and get points while trying to still make the objectives is really entertaining. I find myself leaning in to corners behind my computer which is something I don't think I have done with most games for years and years. This game deserves credit for that really if nothing else.  It however isn't without its flaws. Graphics are so-so and it doesn't really give a spectacular range of maps or anything but it is what it is. A fun game to play when you have a few minutes to kill.
763	1	a	I enjoy the dumb music, judiciously added mechanics and general zaniness.
765	1	a	And interesting Skyfall Game.. I had difficulties with it, but it is interesting. No 'adventure', you're simply attempting to complete an assortment of puzzles. Puzzles are difficult, so prepare to get a little 'ragey'. :) 
767	1	a	Pretty Awesome Game. It has good music and is visually stimulating. It's not hard to pass the levels, but there is always room from improvement making the replay value of this game good. It's fun to play with a friend or two and take turns trying to get the highest score. For $10 it's definitely worth it.
769	1	a	Who deosn't like going fast and scoring points? Oh, and breaking glass with your face, and birds.  It's basejumping in an abstract world with a twisted sense of humor. What's not to love?
189	0	a	this is a game where you FAaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAALL. There is nothing else. There never will be anything. Fall. Rinse. Repeat. We could learn a lesson or two from AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! for the Awesome. If you had a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ idea for a game might as well make it.
771	1	a	AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! For The Awesome holds the record for longest game title. All joking aside, this is a game about jumping off of buildings. (Im serious) You have to get the highest score you can by flying close to buildings and making your descent as creative as possible, all while trying not to die at the same time. This game gives you a rush of excitement and adrenaline as you descend between and around other buildings while at the same time playing a rocking soundtrack. Don't worry about a shortage of levels, there are tons! I'm not sure if this has oculous support (not that I have one at the moment), but if it does, this is THE game for oculous. Just try not to throw up. 10/10 would suicide again. Very fun.
190	0	a	AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!  IT'S A UNITY WEBTOY.  GET YOUR OWN PLAYLIST READY AND PREPARE TO PLAY THIS GAME ONE HANDED.
191	0	a	For a moment, I thought 'The Way of Life,' was my most boring Steam experience, until I recalled this piece!  Pointless!  You do nothing but fall and avoid, getting points by getting as close to buildings for as long as possible. I have better things to do with my time.
773	1	a	Fantastic game! I used to get up every morning and drink coffee and play for 20-40 before work. So much adrenaline!  Pros:  Tons of levels (so many it'll take 10+hours and hours to unlock them all) The game starts off a little 'easy' but ramps up in intensity at a very good pace Tons of neat music Weird ♥♥♥ relaxation tapes scattered around to help you 'chill out' (and they actually work) FULL of weird punny/awkward things. I genuinely laughed pretty hard at some You can base jump from space! On the idea that we learned how to build on air You get 'bones and teeth' from passing stages to unlock more stages Everyone in the world needs more 'Hug's and Kisses'  Cons: Breaking every single bone in your body I somehow lost all my progress (all my 'currency' and unlocked levels) when I switched computers and I didn't play AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! for the Awesome for about 6 months. It only happened once and has been fine for a year or two now. I actually enjoyed unlocking all the levels again! I just miss the crazy hard trippy levels that were hard to get to.    The music, the fun graphics, free falling from space, whizzing back and forth avoiding flying cars and electric cables ect.... This game is the whole package of 'cool'  11/10 I love this game. I still boot it up and enjoy it immensely. I've never played a game like this.  
192	0	a	not my cup of tea. too precise of controls, and not much more than jumping and landing.
775	1	a	I love this game its like skydiving But on AWESOME NEW LEVELS
777	1	a	A free falling, wingsuit, and structure dodging full game. If your a fan of puzzles and timing games then this will be up your alley. Pretty much dodging around and scoring points. A good game to waste your time on when your bored or are looking for a challenge. If you have a fear of heights it will be ok since you never really hit the ground! XD
779	1	a	This is a great game for a couple reasons. 1. It's unique and 2. This game is outstanding in VR. I dont have an Oculus (YET!) but I got this working in stereoscopic 3D with my Emagin Z800's and it is mindblowing :) If you plan on geting an Oculus this is a must buy!  You will look over the edge and feel parts start to pucker. Then you will jump.   Will jump again..
781	1	a	Really scratches that THPS high-score itch. A lot of fun and an original concept!
783	1	a	Surprisingly fun. Distracts small children. Needs more action/naration. Darned good.
785	1	a	Insane FUN right here. The oldest of the series and it's DAMN FUN. I'm getting ready to purchase the newer ones because it's quite addictive. Play with keyboard or controller. Hang on and fly high!  Easy 2 thumbs up.
787	1	a	Awesome physics, but the difficulty is high. I see players on YouTube running through the tracks full speed, but I have trouble even finishing. Still fun to play.
789	1	a	A great physics game. Difficult and strangely addicting. Very rewarding when completing a difficult level.
791	1	a	This is a fun game, but only worth it if its on sale... :P
793	1	a	I started playing trials with Trials HD on the Xbox arcade where I would build my own tracks and try and beat top scores over and over.  This edition of the game is great and feels good when doing a perfect run. The mechanics of the bike and the physics-based rider makes the game have a funny side as well.  I give this a 8.5/10 for being a great pickup and play game.
795	1	a	IT MAKES ME ANGRY BUT IT IS WORTH IT FOR THE MASSIVE HAPPY YOU GET AT THE END!
797	1	a	Best game ever, true story.
799	1	a	Excellent game full of challenges and a high level of replay value great for both adults and kids of all ages.
801	1	a	Trials woo hoo!
803	1	a	Do you hate yourself? Do you love being frustrated? Does the desire to break your screen and keyboard bring a smile to your face? Then Trials 2 is made for you.  That may not sound like a ringing endorsement, but some people like these kinds of games....you know who you are.
805	1	a	Great game. Addictive, with huge replay value.  A controller is highly recommended.
807	1	a	this game is probls the best courtroom drama simulater on the personal computing platform. u get 2 play as redlynx a hotshot lawyer and u do trials about ppl who have done crimes and u have 2 get them off w/ it 
809	1	a	ARCADE WIZARD'S REVIEW  FUN: 5/5  GRAPHICS: 3/5  SHOULD YOU BUY IT?: YES
811	1	a	If you don't mind extremely frustrating games, this one can be great.
813	1	a	made in unity everyone
815	1	a	this is by far one of my favorite little games, way more challenging then the newer titles
817	1	a	OMGWHYDIDN'TIKNOWABOUTTHIS♥♥♥♥INGGAME?!?!?!?!
819	1	a	PURE AWESOMENESS! Controls are a bit tricky but once you master the controls, this game gets very intense! I have WAY more time in-game than Steam shows as it is playable while offline...not many games offer offline play these days. I bought it back in the day on sale for $2.49 but would gladly pay the $9.99 standard price since the game is so much fun!
821	1	a	Moreish. Perfect physics and very punishing.
823	1	a	this game will make u hate your computer!
825	1	a	Nothing but sheer fun! Easy to pick up and play.
827	1	a	The little man on the bike you control is a former Motocross champion turned serial bomber/killer who is forced in the afterlife to ride a bike in order to get all of his limbs painfully broken. You are the executor of his punishment.
829	1	a	Redlynx Trials is one of those games which is easy to pick up but very hard to stop playing. You control a trial bike rider across a wide variety of indoor courses, some of them truly awe-inspiring in their complexity. You're supposed to get the rider from one end of the obstacle course to the other, but the endless faceplants, rashies, crashes and bashes are almost as much fun as safely navigating the course. Never have broken bones been so much fun. For added enjoyment, try playing this with a friend - you can take it in turns to see who breaks the most bones.
831	1	a	if you liked the flash game this one is 10x better
833	1	a	Most addictive masochistic gameplay!
835	1	a	very addicting, tough to master and fun for hours, play with a friend in the room and take turns at beating the tracks. I use an Xbox360 controller it's very hard with a keyboard to be percise on this game WHICH YOU HAVE TO!! (you can play with a 360 controller on most games because 'PC is Microsoft' and you just bought another controller from logitech or something??)
837	1	a	wow if you want the apolyptic vision of the future imagine no further. take your bike on a spin around the tracks and see what can do. you can do a flip and land it, despite yourself. don't give it too much thought just ride like romantic image of motorcycles from the books, and when you had a thought about playing this game you should.
839	1	a	Great !
841	1	a	Dat. First game &lt;3  Payed 2.50€ Go make some stunts and break your neck. 
843	1	a	Do yourself a favour and buy an Xbox controller to play this game!
845	1	a	OMFG this game is reeeeealllllly hard......it makes me almost cry. But if you like challenging game, this is right decision for you. This game will show you what is challenging.
847	1	a	This is a really fun game but it is much better on the Xbox. If you use a controller the response is very slow and even using the trigger for accelerating you either get off or on full. This makes the hard levels much harder than they should be.  I will recommend this game but would say if you want to play it properly, get the Xbox versions as this just seems to me as though the programers got it looking good then just said 'meh!' to the controls.
849	1	a	if you liked the flash game this one is 10x better
851	1	a	This game is just AWESOME!
853	1	a	Most addictive masochistic gameplay!
855	1	a	Be prepared to break every bone in your body, including your controller!
857	1	a	Never have I loved a game more. Never have I hated one so so much. Trials can be very addicting trying to get that 'perfect run' but at the same time oh so frustrating when you fall just short of the end. The best part is that it is never the games fault when you fail. And you always know it. It is incredibly rewarding to finally get through a track without falling, or shaving off just a few tenths of a second off of your time. It's a game that you can play when you only have 10 minutes to play, but can spend hours absorbed too. The controls are tight. There are only 4 buttons to push, but control is deceptively deep and nuanced. The crashes can be hilarious. The tracks are well designed and the difficulty ramps up appropriatly from carefree first levels to the insidiously difficult hard tracks. There is a fairly punishing learning curve about 60% of the way through the tracks, but so satisfying when you get some of the more advanced techniques down. Most games I get excited about have a whole lot to do with the story or the atmosphere of the game. This is one of the very few in recent memory that stand pretty much 100% on the merit of the gameplay itself.

869	1	a	Remember that stuntbike game you played on Miniclip? This is it, looking great in the Source engine.
871	1	a	This is one of the most exciting and addictive game that I've already played. When you start playing, you won't stop until break your records, you'll want to be better in each track you play. And in the March 22th will be realeased the Trials Evolution: Gold Edition for PC. And will have a lot of inovations for the game be more atractive and competitive, for spend a lot of your time in the game. This game is like drugs, when you start, you'll never stop, but I think that is a good drug, or no. So, if you want a reaally good game, that will help you when you'are bored, this is the perfect choice!
193	0	a	The physics are way off. If you're leaning all the way forward and you go off a ramp, you shouldn't spin backwards.
194	0	a	Bone crunchingly hard...even with a game controller. The game mechanics and physics just seem completely abnormal and take all enjoyment out of the game letting frustration take over.
195	0	a	This game is a piece of $h!t. If you own it, it's because it was on-sale.....again.
196	0	a	Waste of money as the demo is as entertaining as the game. Small cost at least.  Have about 10+ hours in this game.
197	0	a	Christ this game has not aged well. Dodgy physics and little-to-no controller support really kills it for me, stick to newer Trials games I'd suggest
198	0	a	If you came looking for more Trials after playing Trials Evolution, this is a big downgrade. Mainly the controls are extremely sensitive and finicky and just handle poorly, which makes this whole experience much more frustrating than it needs to be compared to the others in the series, which are much more fun.
199	0	a	This game easily the most brutal and unforgiving game I have ever played. If you can mange to get it to stop crashing and freezing your graphics card, you will be treated to ridiculous elasticy physics and frustrating glitches (like your bike folding in half on a regular basis).  The learning curve is extremely steep, which is reflected by the nearly impossible achievements. In order to become half decent at Trials 2, you will need to study replays and practice infuriating sections of track for hours on end, and even then you have no hope of touching the leaderboards.  So unless you have a lot of time on your hands, and like extremely difficult challenges, think again before you choose this game.
200	0	a	I'm never quite sure what to do with these games. I play through the Trials until I get stuck, and then I don't quite have the motivation to play them over and over. If you enjoy the racing and physics tedium, it might be enough to hook you.
201	0	a	Got this in a bundle of two games for like 5 bucks, still got ripped off.... I wonder if the developers had ever ridden a motorcycle prior to the development of this game. Unfortunately, Steam won't let you return digitally purchased games, no matter how awful they are...
202	0	a	Good game, but the PC version of Trials Evolution: Gold Edition has a much more refined engine and all the levels of this game (plus many many more levels on top of that). Pick that up instead.
203	0	a	Crap controller support, crap sound, crap sense of speed.  Expected anything like the old games or trials HD, got nothing.
204	0	a	It's a piece of crap it doesn't work
205	0	a	i started on hd see this on steam though id try a earlyer 1 not a good idea this feels horrid, floaty and tracks just arnt fun
206	0	a	WUT? .... xbox version has editor, but not PC version? ... :(  That's the only reason i played it.... waaaaaaa! :'( 
207	0	a	The painful absence of true controller support, no analogue and controller doesn't work in menus, leaves this game feeling like a shoddy half baked port that plays much much better on the consoles than it does on PC. If you want to play this game, buy it on Xbox.  
208	0	a	Bought this cause I love Trials HD on the 360. Contols felt totally different to the point of I just couldn't play it. Gave Up on it. Then Trials Evolutions Gold came out. Was afraid to waste money again but found it on sale and took a try. Felt exactly the same Trails Hd on the 360. How same you might ask, well Evolution Gold includes Original Trial HD levels. My times are for the most part exactly the same. I most likely will never reinstall this game. Get Evo Gold instaed of this, just my 2 cents..
209	0	a	This is bascially a set of mini-games that involve stunts. You calc the strength, distance, direction, ect for stunts. You get score based on the outcome.  Its not bad, but also a bit more limited than I was hoping for...  Its ok for what it is.
210	0	a	great concept.graphics are good.let down by frustrating levels that require bunny jumps (hold back then push up at end of ramp).this move is a paradox as performing it causes you to flip.who thought of this move is an idiot.it should be straightforward balance and gas control.unless you are a master gamer with perfect hand-eye coordination then avoid.could have been a brilliant game if it had been engineered for the general gamer buts its not.so if you dont have the patience of a saint or the hand-eye skills of a cyborg then leave well alone.....
211	0	a	While the game itself is fun, it's a horrible port. It's definatly gamepad focused so there's no excuse why the menues can't be controlled with a gamepad. It's also very poorly optimized.  Don't buy this, buy the excellent Trials Evolution instead, which is a far better game and has all the things this game is missing.
212	0	a	Playing Trials 2 is like going to a restaurant, and ordering the chili.  First, you're impressed. It's pretty good! The meat is tender, the onions and beans are flavorful, the broth is robust.  Then, the cook comes out and adds some Cayenne pepper, to give it just a little spice. Superb! Well done!  And then the cook comes out again and adds some more Cayenne pepper. Well, I mean... why? It's quite good the way it is. You can still taste the other ingredients, and it's not bad, but things are kind of getting overwhelmed by the spice.  And then the cook comes out once more and dumps a gallon if Cayenne pepper into your dish. Now you're irritated, but you know there's good chili in there, right? You take a bite, and try to ignore the spiciness, but even when you find a great big chunk of meat or something, all you can taste is spice. Spice, spice, spice.  Difficulty is good in a game. A little spice is more than nice. But when your game's gimmick is that it gets so difficult that you can no longer taste the enjoyable stuff, well... what's the point? Who wants to eat THAT dish?  A bad chef is one who sucks at chili. An unforgivable chef is one who ruins good chili. The same goes for game devs - good game, ruined because some idiot was all like 'XTREEEEEEEM MEANS HARD, RIGHT?' I will not be purchasing any games by Red Lynx again.
213	0	a	Compared to newer entries in the Trials series, Trials 2 feels incredibly dated. Its lack of polish, unrefined and floaty physics, and just general quality-of-life features show just how far RedLynx have come over the years. This is a very barebones game, but it was necessary for the devs to get to the point that they're at now. As it stands, this is a decently fun little time-waster, but the Miniclip sponsorship signs in the background show you exactly what kind of mindset you should approach this with.  Overall, I recommend skipping this version and picking up Trials Evolution or Fusion instead. Or, you could even play their mobile app, which is also very good.
214	0	a	This game is fun when you're bored, but it also lags a bit so it's very frustrating when you're bored.
215	0	a	Why have you lied to me, Chris Livingston? This game isn't really fun at all. Maybe for like 2 hours. What the hell!
873	1	a	wroom wroom. An easier version of Trials 2 HD, in which you can only go fowards and backwards.. kinda like elastomania.
875	1	a	A Trials HD game with monster trucks. Oh yeah!
877	1	a	Hahaha this game..... cant describe it JUST PERFECT! not really...
879	1	a	My brother's son enjoys this game, he is 4. Several of the levels are easy to finish. IMHO it'n not a bad game, but it's not good either.  For some reason it doesn't work on my Win8-64 bit PC, but works fine on Win7 and Win8-32 bit.
881	1	a	Simple control... gas, brake, forward tilt, backward tilt, nitro... but really have to judge speed and landing aim well to get the best times and the gold. Good graphics. Engine sound is okay for this type of game, but could have been better. Challenging levels. Reasonalbe menus. Cute design.  But considering the game is already 7 years old, I don't think it's worth $19.99... more like $4.99, or no more than $6.99.  I recommend this game, but not at a highway robbery price.
883	1	a	There are so many things I could tell you about this game, but I can't because then Valve would be forced to remove my account.
885	1	a	A game with tons of potential for all types of players - whether you want to just plough through the levels no mater what the final result and finish all maps, or go back to perfect your score even more, this game is very nice to have. This game can be played for hours on end, or just a couple of minutes when you just want to have a quick race to enjoy short pleasant monster-trucking.
216	0	a	clearly the test game for the TRIALS series. It's playable. 5/10  Do not pay anything above 1.99 for it.  
217	0	a	It's rare to find games that are so horrible, it just isn't even worth writing about them. Monster Trucks Nitro is one of those rare games.
218	0	a	Jump. Jump. Jump.  Jump.  That's it. Nothing else. Hit the gas and jump.  It also somehow still sufferes from lag on systems far more powerful than the recommended requriements.
219	0	a	This has to be one of the worst games I have ever played. Stay far away...Even if its free!!!
220	0	a	Won't run, crashes to desktop on Mac
221	0	a	lol I played a few minutes and did a few jumps. I thought... this is cool. Turned it off and never turned it back on.  You are just jumping but you do not actually control the trucks, you just do the set up and gas, but no turning. So no reason to play more than 20 minutes of fun in my opinion.
222	0	a	At the time of this review the price is currently £16.99 ...... whoever ramped up the price that high should be ashamed of themselves. This game is worth no more than £0.99 in sale.  Shame ...  Could have been up there with the Trials games.  It appears like the devs have lazily ported an app version of this game to the PC.  When booting the game, a config page is displayed, but selecting my resolution of 2560 x 1440 meant that all textures in the game were so garbled and messy I had no idea what was being said/displayed.  I read a fix for this which says to start the game at a low res like 1024 x 768, then use the in game resolution changer (NOT the 1st config page) to set the correct resolution. But, the textures don't seem to be optimised for higher resolutions like 2560 x 1440. The clunky way of clicking through every screen resolution before hitting the right one is quite annoying ... was it really too much like hard work to add a drop down selector?!  Not made for PC. Should be sold very cheap to reflect its value to the PC gamers.  See screenshot for textures issue - the textures display fine at low resolutions:         Monster Trucks Nitro&nbsp;
223	0	a	Worst Piece of trash i've ever had on Steam, everything is super glitchy, colors are super bright, and i don't understand why it doesn't want to work properly even after changing so many options, the menu still super blurry (i use Windows 8 but this is the only game that can run but doesn't work properly), i don't recommend wasting time on this, even if it were free, not worth it, it's waste of space, at least i got it for free, Deleted within less than 10 minutes
887	1	a	Think the alternate version of Mario Kart for PC. This is a fast paced, balanced game which has alot of different game modes (stunts, traditional racing, sports, arcade). You can fully customize your kart and player sometimes resulting in hilarious and ridiculous creations. It is definetly meant to be played with friends as it is way better (AI can be as smart as a banana) and there are no active servers. Hours of pure and legit fun.
889	1	a	Good game! Nice game! Bombastic game!  This game is for lovers of kart racing! I played this game for 32 hours and I enjoy it maximally!   +: +Graphic. Yes, is not difficult!

(-1.5 points)  8.5 points for this game! BUY IT! If you agree with me rate!
891	1	a	I first played this game back in 2010 free weekend offer.... I enjoyed it a lot, I saw this on steam Summer Sale for 99c bought and soon realized that this game has been abandoned. It's very difficult to find a server but for 99c it’s worth it. What I'd recommend is pick this game up on sale with your mates you'll enjoy it DO NOT pay full price for this as i mentioned it is abandoned by the community and the developer. I discovered there were only 15 maps. Considering all the mini games (which do get somewhat repetitive) are included in this list of 15, that leaves less than 10 maps to actually race on, but you can't go wrong with 99cent for this....
893	1	a	Classic kart game, with races, football, hockey, basketball, touchdown, sumo and more. A blast to play with friends.
895	1	a	The physics are terrible and the multiplayer is dead but this is a fun game to mess around in if you have friends to play with. For a low budget game it has a bit of variety. Its offers racer customization, a stunt mode, and goal mode which is similiar but is done better in rocket league.
225	0	a	The Extreme Paintbrawl of kart-racers. You're stuck with the AI since the community (rightfully) died and said AI can be gamed to always lose if you just hit escape and go into the menu. They begin running directly forward and never changing direction.  Custom servers also a crapshoot - it refused to let me play another mode/level than 'Punchbowl' and 'tag' no matter what I set it to.  I didn't really think people needed to be warned away but damnit, if I'm gonna play this for a bit, I'm gonna write about it too.
897	1	a	Zero people play Zero Gear, taking a lot of the fun out of it...but it's still worth it if you find it on sale.
899	1	a	Really fun to play with friends 8/10
901	1	a	This game is really good. Yet no servers are ever open. Why.
903	1	a	Reminds you of the good old mario kart. I suggest you get it while it's still 0.99€
905	1	a	What a rubbish game. Level design is repetitive. Cutomisation is limited. Controls are horrible. Camera angle, horrible.   And yet, I love it.
907	1	a	Very nice kart racing game on steam, a la mario kart. 9/10 game just needs more players, but still fun with friends....
909	1	a	Fun game, I enjoyed playing it for awhile. Reminded me of Mario Kart 64's Battle Mode a bit.
911	1	a	You can make a PANDA in a PINK TANK here. Nuff said. 20/10  And seriously. This is kind of game that can be really fun if you've got friends to play it with. Good time killer. Good for having silly fun.  It has some disatvantages of course. Some may complain about physics and some other stuff. No game is prefect. And this one really isn't expensive.  Remember; You can make any game fun with right attitude! .... And friends if possible,  ~ D.Punk
913	1	a	Quite fun, too bad no one plays it.
915	1	a	I recommend this game, but there are a few bad things to mention: 1.) There's rarely any servers. 2.) If you play with friends, and host your own server, there might be major server lag. 3.) I think it's been abandoned by the devs, so basically your going to get what you get, and you can't throw a fit.  Some upsides: 1.) There is currently a dedicated server set up by someone that runs continuously and has almost no server lag. 2.) It's extremely fun if you can get a bunch of friends together to play. Imagine Mario Karts, but on PC and focused around online multiplayer.  It's probably best to only get it if you have friends you can play with. I think this game is definitely worth the $5.
917	1	a	Mario who? A TRUE MASTERPIECE, don't let my 3 hours on this game trick you into thinking I did not like this game, I literally had to stop because I couldn't handle the girth of content that this game has to offer.
919	1	a	it's only fun with friends guys buy it best game 111/11 :D &lt;333
921	1	a	Since i started to play the football mode in this game i've never touched Rocket League again.  4/20
923	1	a	'♥♥♥♥ this Game' I give it 10/10
925	1	a	Kinda fun. But noone plays mp lol.

959	1	a	This game is absolutely stellar.  The game's strong point is the online multiplayer where you battle it out in what can best be described as a amalgymation of MarioKart, Sonic, and Smash Bros. This is an excellent party game if you have friends over.  The mechanics seem simple at first, but as you play through the game you'll realize that they are all intertwined in such a way that you can play in ways unimaginable to your newbie self. You constantly encounter people who have mastered aspects of the game that you weren't even aware of. There is virtually no limit to how good you can get. The gameplay is a nonstop adrenaline rush as you vie to dominate the poor saps (or the no-lifer!) who got matched with you.   Knowing what I know now, I would gladly pay 10x the price for access to this experience. Very entertaining, very addictive. I foresee this game being a part of my cycle for decades to come. 13/10

If you want to grab a game and play it competitively, this is your game. It won't be long until you see how far you've gotten. Now how do you begin? Well I recommend grabbing some friends and playing with them for a short while so you can get used to the controls and all the maps. As you play through the game you'll recognize there will always be better ways to run them. With that being said now go have fun with this game!

993	1	a	Great four player competitive platforming! Pros: -Lots of playable characters and skins -Secret characters -Easy to pick up really hard to master -Great for casual parties, and competitive playing as well -Fun items to help you and ruin your friendships -Every offical map is tagged, so you can see how hard it is -Level editor, workshop support -Theres a random workshop map option in ranked so you can play some curated workshop levels in that mode as well -You can enable fun effects in custom play -Online rank system -A rather short story mode with four difficulty options and unlockable comics -XP system wich unlocks stuff with progress -Twitch integration in the menu -Community events -Custom trail editor  Neutral: -Trail shop, where you can buy trails  Cons: -The game still has some issues and bugs, however the devs are really active and fix bugs with every patch -Even tough theres a 'tutorial' in the game it hardly explains anything about the basic mechanics of the game.Its not a problem for casual players but if you want to play ranked beyond expert league you will have to look up some videos. Fortunetly the menu shows some great tutorial videos for these purposes.  Overall this is a great game if you are looking for an online competitive oriented game. I wouldnt recommend it for the story mode because its really short and theres no real story to the game to be honest. Its definitely worth it for the countless hours you can play in online.

We thought it would be fun but it has brought us farther apart than we have ever been. I am currently down 3 monitors and 2 headsets. My friend is down a DX racer and a monitor and my olther friend is down nothing because he wins every single match and ruins everything for us. Good game if you visiting your friends with a bat after each session, but if not, do not buy it.

1063	1	a	Speedrunners is a fast-paced (obviously), two-dimensional, 4-player racing game with a surprisingly high skill cap and a good amount of progression. Quick matches are around five minutes in length, which is quite a refreshing break from the 45-90 minute games of CS:GO so many of us are intent on playing every day.  While it is fun, fast-paced, and cheap, it DOES have its issues... The main mechanic of the game is a steadily decreasing screen size which bottlenecks the players' view of the map, where any player that falls out of frame is immediately killed. The major problem is that in maps that are more vertical than horizontal, the camera does not know who to follow. Oftentimes, players that are lower faze out a higher player or vice versa, entirely out of luck.  Besides this and a few other issues (random deaths when getting too far ahead of your opponents, stuck in walls, etc), the game holds its weight fairly well for such a cheap title. They NEED to implement a Group Queue option for ranked and quick play, though. This game is far more fun to play with friends, and finding them in Ranked is difficult - particularly when they're a few ranks lower than you.

1075	1	a	Best fast-paced, racing, multiplayer game I have played so far. I enjoyed every minute playing it, especially when played with friends. The community is awesome. Community maps are very well done and some of 'em are even playable in competitive. Some items will make you laugh your a** off when used properly - but sometimes they make you wanna smash your controller against the f*cking wall.  10/10 would buy a new controller to keep playing.

1089	1	a	SpeedRunners is one of the most fantastic small titles available on steam, as a multiplayer game it's one of the most fantastic around. The gameplay is extremely fun the overall concept is pretty different and it has a good amount of gimmicks to practise and learn to get an upper hand. It's very fun and I haven't had so much fun since that first night playing with a group of friends. Recently announced is a level editor too which will also be a fantastic edition to an already great game. High recommend.
1091	1	a	This game should be called: How to lose friends and gain enemies
1093	1	a	I would recommend this only if you have friends to play with.Anyways great game!

1105	1	a	after 1000 hours i can say that i have some experience at the game. i'm the 25th on the world, i had really funny moments and really stressful moments. However, the game is much funnier if you're playing with friends or something like that. it took me 1000 hours in 7 months!  DRUGS 10/10 GAMEPLAY 10/10 COMMUNITY 9.5/10  
1107	1	a	Fast-paced racing game unlike any of you have seen before. Instead of cars, the game is a symbolic representation of how some gamers blast through a game without fully enjoying it. However, you actually enjoy it in this game! You play as one of numerous speed-bent characters with Steam-exclusive editions such as TF2's Scout and Payday 2's Wolf in a thriving array of maps as you race against other players and/or bots to eliminate your competitiors by getting them off of the screen while staying in the lead. There are numerous items and gameplay mechanics that can help you achieve that, such as a grappling hook, C4s, homing missles, freeze rays, wall-jumping, fireballs and more! The story is told through unlockable comics and each character has its own purpose in the game as well as multiple skins to stand out in the crowd. The game has a multiplayer mode, ranked mode, and allows you to easily play with your friends. The game is purely skill-based and while you can spend real-money, you can only acquire cosmetic speed trails that have no effect on your character's performance. If you are looking for a way to pass-time in a thrilling yet entertaining way, this is the game for you!

1123	1	a	This game is really great. The amount of optimization you can have on a map is insane. Just when you think you've hit the best possible strategy and timing, someone else comes along and rips that dream from you and you're forced to take it back. In 18 hours I never reached the most optimized run. I was great but there was always someone who was better and that is a very good thing. I haven't played the game for a year but in the time I spent with it there were no negatives.

1199	1	a	People told me before I bought it that this game is a Mario Kart in 2D.  They were totally right. I used to play a lot of Mario Kart Wii when I was younger and got better and better at it with each race I did.   SpeedRunners works a lot in the same way. You'll pass through the same levels over and over again, but you'll always find a new technique to go faster or trick your opponents.   With time, you'll get better and better, and after a few hundred hours, you'll be as skilled as the hundreds of other good players out there. All it takes is some practice.  I love this game. It's so fun and interesting, especially the multiplayer. :3

1217	1	a	This is another one of my favorite games of all time and I have been playing it since the xbox 360 days. Destroying your friends has never been more satisfying. Also has a friendly community, (not at all toxic) which is a nice change from LoL. With its' full release the game has never been in a better state and I love all the new features it has brought to the table. Would recommend this game to anyone even if this isn't near their taste of gaming. Also all of the workshop content that users make keeps the game very fresh because original maps can get old eventually. Personal rating has to be 9/10 for its' amount of fresh content, trail making, fair pricing, the amount of fun with friends, and replay-ability the game has. (Speedrunners 2, please?!?) Love the game guy!

1221	1	a	This game is a sorta mix of Mari Party meets Mario Kart meets nearly perfect platforming.  Meaning that it will destroy friendships, ruin lives, make you rekindle them in the same moment, and the entire time you keep going 'just one more round'  A game that on paper I thought wouldn't work but ended up being yet another great title that I played a ton of.   Plays best with friends, but the community is very friendly as well.
1223	1	a	The maps are great, it has workshop support for more maps, and the mechanics in the game are excellent.  This game would be better if it focused more on teaching the player on the more advanced mechanics in the game. That's the biggest thing holding it back.

Well, it's original review was about 2 years ago and the fresh one was about 1 year ago.  Time to post a new, that have said everything about it, but is also short, review:  This game is great.

1479	1	a	A good amazing game! Recommended it!
1481	1	a	This is a fast paced insanely fun game with a great art style (reminiscent of the movie Incredibles) and a fun soundtrack. The beginning of SpeedRunners is a bit problematic for example it took me a while to figure out how to change the controls. And the story is only useful because of the new characters you can get, but the dialogue is painfully cliche. It's obvious that this is truly a great game but I would only recommend getting it if you have someone else to play with. KILLZONE gives this game a 7/10. Fun.

1925	1	a	This game is super fun with friends. Online play seems pretty good as well, although I have not invested much time into it.
1927	1	a	Careful, don't play with someone you like. Especially your family. You'll hate them.  Better than pewdiepies youtube sim
1929	1	a	This is a fantastic party game and it deserves more recognition.

1935	1	a	Best game of all time.
1937	1	a	It's a side scrolling racer where the object isn't to finish laps ahead of your opponents, but instead only to get far enough ahead of your opponents to push them off the screen to their explosive death. It's got a bronze/silver age comic book feel to the aesthetic. It reminds me of the racing game included with Kirby Super Star.
1939	1	a	This is a fantastic party game and it deserves more recognition.
1941	1	a	Super fun to play with friends, but unfortunately the community behind this game is pretty much dead. If you have friends to play this game with, I would highly recomend it.
1943	1	a	the best game ever!.
1945	1	a	Very fun game to play, especially with friends. A mulitplayer where you really get the mario kart feeling. Racing, getting weapons.. shoot eachother and hold the super speed longer then your nemesis to own him/her.
1947	1	a	Just recently getting into this game, I'll never be good enough to beat the veterans online, and maybe not even my friends - but I still enjoy every second of it.  Great stylized graphics (seriously, just watch someone else play and pay attention to the level artwork in the background). A catchy big band soundtrack that's totally unique. Snappy gameplay that allows you to get better, inches at a time.  The most fun you can have with this is to start playing along with three friends who haven't played before. Figure out the game mechanics together and accept your defeats gracefully.

1955	1	a	You know, this game turned out to be a lot more fun than I excpected. It may not look great on first sight, 'What is this, a 2D runner game?'. Bad mistake. I had A LOT of fun with this game when playing with friends. Maps are well made and the game will make you shout at your friends. If you have friends to play this with you, totally recommended.  If you don't its still great ( you can search for people to play this online ), maybe wait for a sale to get it.

2095	1	a	Speedrunners is a great game to play with friends, Speedrunners is a great game to play alone. No matter how you play it, speedrunners is a great game worth every penny. Don't be discouraged by the fact that it's still in early acess, because it still has a decent amount of developer maps, and a seemingly infinite stream of good player created maps. I have played for quite a while, and the only bug i have encountered out of all the games I've played, was a small item glitch, and that should say something. If you haven't already bought it, stop trying to convince yourself not to and buy it!  TLDR:  early acess? yes.  no quality content worth your money?  ABSOLUTLEY NOT

2101	1	a	The perfect party game for classic platforming fans, yet easy enough to master for new players, SpeedRunners has a bit of everything that will keep you and your friends addicted. Watch out for items (which can be toggled on or off) as well as the continuously shrinking screen. The best comparison I can think of is Wii U's Runbow.

2293	1	a	Saw game and thought about buying it. Decided to look at reviews first. Saw lots of reviews talking about losing friendships over it. Thought they were jokes and laughed them off. Convinced friend to buy game. Played for a few days with few incidents. Playing a match with same friend. He uses grappling his hook and I hit him with a mine at the same time. Causes his hook to swing him backwards out of screen. I win the round. Disconnected from game. Friend says, 'This game is literal trash'. Uninstalls speedrunners. Go to write this review. Tell friend about it. He says, 'If you post that review i'm banning you from discord.' Good. I don't need him. Only elite speedrunners on this friends-list. Post anyway. Losing a friend has never felt so good. 10/10

2501	1	a	No game is playable if the mechanics are ♥♥♥♥. Thankfully, SpeedRunners game mechanics are pretty great, some glitches in maps under special circumstances (SuperSpeed is huge for breaking maps) but overall definitely a game I'd recommend picking up, however, only if on sale. I don't think this game is worth near $20 given there's DLC that can definitely push your wallet overboard. Pick it up on sale or through a friend.  Another fix needed would have to be ping problems while on competitive. Place a max ping so those rubberbanding don't get a free shot at winning because the others hooked a rubber banding player. Just not fair.  9/10, overpriced and a tad bugged but totally a great play.

2765	1	a	This game is the boss. If you are a fan of competive and fun local multiplayer games then very few games match the finess of this title. Its fast, its hectic,there is a fair amount of skill involved and you have a wealth of opportunities to screw your friends over. Its awesome.  The game mechanic and the goal is very simple. You have run , jump and grapple a head of the pack and then extend your lead until all the others are out of the screen. Only thing is, you cant see too much ahead and your friends have got nasty abilities to screw you over with. So good luck and good speed :P  As always with local mp games, 4 is the perfect number of players. Exellent entertainment.  9/10  PS: do yourself a favor and dont play it alone, you will only find it a lesser game than it really is. This game is designed to ruin your relationships and loose frinds over.

2909	1	a	Hello! Speedrunners Is a really good game for a party or if you just want to play a small game where you can stop (almost) instantly. It is really handy if you want to make a decision for example you want to decide wich game you play the guy who wins chooses the game. 4 pack recommended but if you want to play online it's also fun because you can rank up. And the developers are interested in your experience for example map making contest!

3015	1	a	SpeedRunners is not a good consistent day after day game. However it has a lot of replay value, in the sense that you and your friends can return to the game every so often and still have fun. Speedrunners may seem simple at face value but there can be a bit of complexity to it.   Final thoughts:  - BUY THE GAME - If you want a good party game to play once in a while. - DO NOT BUY - If you want a game to play everyday.

3069	1	a	Yes I agree this game is great, original, fantastic etc.. exept when I found unfair mode and what exploits can be found to beat the game now once I found these exploits, I've been dashing through these AI games and regular games, which to me make this game completly broken and doesn't require any skill, once I learned the exploits it became second nature ultimately making the game skilless, the only good parts of this game I'd say is regular matched without exploits and no AI that can run faster than you. In my opinion, when you've played enough and learned enough, you become a god creating no challenges, but thats the point of games right? They have a goal and getting to the goal is a challenge, not in this game. But it's still great and fun if you don't come across anyone else in public games using these exploits, just play normally. Anyway I'm done with this game as soon as I've got all achievements. Still don't like unfair mode, almost directly forces you to use the exploits.

3437	1	a	SpeedRunners is a competitive indie racing game with a 2-D artstyle and a fun soundtrack. It has both single player and multiplayer modes and a variety of fun characters with different personalities. The goal of the game is to knock out your enemies by making them hit the edges of the screen, and you can race through a variety of unique levels with an arsenal of items to do so. This game is pure addictive multiplayer chaos. It's fast paced, it's competitive, and it even has a story! I see this game as a must-have if you're into indie games and is a joy to play with your friends.

3615	1	a	Fantastic game that has been fun since I got it in early access. Now that it is fully realeased, I can say that I am having a more fulfilling experience, since it is more fun to ABSOLUTELY DEMOLISH the newbs that bought the game on release.   10/10 would recommend as a fun game that can double as a competitive one  P.S.: boxes and spikes are no bueno

3859	1	a	This game takes all the fun of Mario Kart 64 and puts it into a 2D platform engine. It's very addictive, fun as a party game and equally fun as a 'Story Mode' playthrough. Tinybuild is a sponsor of Games Done Quick and I purchased this after it was advertised on the twitch live stream. They have a very good original game in almost every genre you can imagine so this studio has something for everyone. If you're into compeditive games or even just 2D platformers you'll love this game.

5853	1	a	Turned on te game, went super speed on the second race i played 10/10 would go super speed agian
5855	1	a	It's a good game if you play online. It offers endless hours of fun. Also don't play the crap workshop levels. I rate 8.5/10. (during early access I would rate 7.5/10 because there wasn't as much cool stuff) It's one of the best games in my library.

5895	1	a	Honestly, by far one of my all time favourite games!
5897	1	a	Freaking love this game. It's 2D Mario Kart. Get some controllers, get some friends, bash it out like it's N64 days all over again.
5899	1	a	  Gotta go fast    wish you didn't have to pay for trails, great game tho

5923	1	a	Very Good Game!
5925	1	a	Stands up to it's name
5927	1	a	One of best Indie competition games ! A must-have for speedrun lovers
5929	1	a	Fast paced, Challenging, and definitly Rage inducing. This is a great game for someone who wants to test their skill in momentum, timing, and SPEED. Online Multiplayer is rage inducing but if you pay attention you will learn soemthing 
5931	1	a	This is the exact type of game I suck at and I love it!! One of those annoyingly amazing frustrating rage enducing games that you see people make look easy and then BANG it really is not!  It is fast paced, challenging and hilarious with friends! a real must have for some quick banter and instant swearing!
5933	1	a	This game is 10/10
5935	1	a	I just love this game so much. When it was released for Mac I had SOO much fun with my friends. Would def recommend it, and I would buy the dlcs but its only for Windows Q.Q   10/10 Would Play NMW.

5939	1	a	Whether you play with your friends or againt random people on the innternet you're guarenteed to have a blast with this game. That being said, if you ever want to seriously rank up, you're going to need a lot of practice. The skill platforms between ranks in this game increase exponentially.
5941	1	a	A pretty good game where you  gotta go fast  and become   the fastest man alive  so you can end your friendships with one single grappling hook. 5/7
5943	1	a	Funny game i like it.It's verry fun to play with your friends.Reccomend you to buy this game

5993	1	a	Very fun game with neat mechanics
5995	1	a	Think Mario Kart or Worms for lovers of platformers. You can easily dip in and out of this so you can either play a couple of quick rounds or spend longer trying to improve.  Personally I find it funny when I manage to show a rare moment of brilliance by clawing my way to the front of the pack only to destroy myself in a comedy of errors in quick succession. Your mileage may vary.   Sometimes you'll get stuck with a group that favours voting for the same couple of fan made levels which I personally find a bit tedious to play but there is a good variety of stages both official and fan made.  It's up to you whether you want to just play casually or build on your skils and work you way through the level rankings but either way there is fun to be had and it never feels like a real chore.

6011	1	a	john is bad at it
6013	1	a	Holy crap have I enjoyed this game. Many people are right. It's like mario kart and Smash bros. mixed into a single game. This is perfect when you gather with friends and just play for a while. Although when you try to go competitive it just takes you to the moon. The only things I don't like are the community and the fact that it is not very well known. The community doesn't focus much on the fun of it and will scold you for using items in online play. It's not perfect but it is too much fun.

6057	1	a	Great game, highly addictive and very satisfying when you nail it.
6059	1	a	I nominated Speedrunners, because I have a lot of fun, while playing this with my friends.
6061	1	a	Better with friends so that you can yell at them for hooking you, shooting missles at you, for blocking your hooks, and making your life miserable. Better with friends so that you can laugh at them when you win or yell at them when you lose.  10/10
6063	1	a	Best game to have fun with friends.
6065	1	a	You want play game with your friends? Buy this game.  10/10

6069	1	a	  Great game! In this game you simply just try to run faster than your opponent. It´s very fun with friends. Power ups are awesome. Some players are salty but it doesn´t matter. It´s not a pay to win game. You can unlock skins and characters by leveling up. There can be little bit glitches but it doesn´t affect the gameplay a lot.. I recommend this game for all kinds of players. If you don´t have friends... GET SOME FRIENDS TO PLAY THIS GAME WITH!
6071	1	a	Super Fast, Super speedy, Much sonic, Much wow, Buy the game.
6073	1	a	This game is a great way to spend an afternoon yelling at your friends.
6075	1	a	i found this game by watching some youtubers and i thought that it looked like a good amount of fun, however i didnt have much money so i was a bit hesitant to buy it. After a couple of months i recieved a notification that the game was free for the weekend so epople could try it out. after about 10 hours in two days i bought the game the moment the trial ended. its an absolutely great game which i have never regretted buying because it has gameplay which is always entertaning. whether you're struggling to keep up with a pro, slowing down for a noob or having an intense match with someone on par you can always have a laugh about the result. And probably one of the greatest hings about this game is the community, this game gets nowhere near the same amount of toxic players as other games, almost all of the players are friendly happy people (i honestly believe that in all of my time playing i've only come across 10 toxic players and 1 bot). as a result i could not recommend this game enough and encourage you to get it as soon a you can.  I look forward to seeing you on the race track.

6139	1	a	It's like if mario kart and super meat boy had a baby. Except it also brings along the frustrations of those games with it, albeait less extreme. So be prepared for that, and let the friendship tarnishing commence!
6141	1	a	  the only thing this game is missing is a fail compilation
6143	1	a	Games consist of the following -Troll your friends -Troll other players -Use skills everytime -Be the secret characters  Yeah I love it!
6145	1	a	Amazing game. It's so simple, but so entertaining. I can play it for hours without being bored. From online multiplayer to story, and singleplayer. 5/5 stars.
6147	1	a	If you need local activity, buy this game. Plain and simple. I cannot even review the 1 player because I've never played haha. This is one of the ultimate couch gaming experiences. I can play with my 8yr son or my 30 year old fiance. This is a great game for all ages that never gets old. I would even pay full price!

6665	1	a	Easy to learn, difficult to master gameplay. The platforming 'feels good', netcode and matchmaking are great, and the community is large for an indie game. There is full workshop support and thus player made levels ad nauseam, many of which are excellent.  3.5/5

Knock all players off the screen 3 times in a row to win.   Speedrunners is truely fast paced. Whilst I have not played the campaign mode yet, I don't think the story is or would be too appealing, and that's perfectly okay with me.  Holy shinoa the artstyle. The game has a sort of comic book or cartoon type of feel, and every level's design has something fresh and new for the formula. Not to mention, this game has integrated Workshop support, allowing any joe-schmo to make very complicated or stupidly easy levels.  God diggity doozle these controls. The controls are amazingly tight and are perfect in competitive modes. If you mess up, that's you.  Overall, Speedrunners is worth every cent. I could not find any flaw and if you want to have a good time with friends, do yourself a favor and buy this.  My (True) rating: 10/10

6815	1	a	This game takes all the fun of Mario Kart 64 and puts it into a 2D platform engine. It's very addictive, fun as a party game and equally fun as a 'Story Mode' playthrough. Tinybuild is a sponsor of Games Done Quick and I purchased this after it was advertised on the twitch live stream. They have a very good original game in almost every genre you can imagine so this studio has something for everyone. If you're into compeditive games or even just 2D platformers you'll love this game.

7455	1	a	Very Very Goood. Fun to play with friends
7457	1	a	This game is fun
7459	1	a	A very fun game reminiscent of Running Wild, but unfortunatley hamppered by some of the most unbalanced ranked multiplayer I've ever experienced. I recomend only if you don't care about online rankings or leaderboards.
7461	1	a	Definietly a game to play with a few friends when they're over, fun and casual, if you're not sure about purchasing just wait for a sale.
7463	1	a	  Awesome addicting game, check out our story mode!         SpeedRunners!&nbsp;

7517	1	a	This game has always been a favorite playing at a friends house. its awesome endless hours of fun! It recently became avaliable on mac so i purchased out of pure excitement. I also recently purchased a steam controller since most of my games are controller supported. well it didnt quite pan out as I planned. it doesnt work with a lot of games controller supported or not, no matter how i configure the controller. I can still play with the keyboard, but id love to see it working on speedrunners soon. 9.5/10  ps. of coarse the guy with a mac buys a steam controller *facepalm*
7519	1	a	A really fun game once you get familiar with its physics. The only complaint I'd have is the ranking system, which sometimes puts experts with not-so-good players. But this only happens when there aren't many players online, so it's forgivable.

7531	1	a	Not alone do you need skill, but you need to memorize the maps. Muscle memory is key, but complete and utter focus are too. If you're looking for a top end, critical game, this ones for you.
7533	1	a	A fast paced game that is great to play with friends.
7535	1	a	'Graphics: Your toaster'  It's a good game.
7537	1	a	  Very funny and good game +100.
7539	1	a	This game is fun and fast paced with it's variety of characters, weapons, and many workshop maps.  It also has a ranked system if your into that jazz &amp; a level up system that unlocks skin varieties and new characters.   It also has secret codes for new characters - YOU CAN BE A POTATO   If you and your friends are looking for a game to tear you friend ship apart with very frustrating races. Go for it.

7547	1	a	Easy to learn, hard to master, fast-paced platforming bliss. Oh, there's also Bionic Commando-style grappling hooks, Mario Kart-style item pickups, and Meat Boy-style 'any mistakes are your own' controls. If you've ever enjoyed a platformer before, there's no reason for you to not buy this game.

7561	1	a	Not even horror games get my heart pumping this fast.
7563	1	a	Outrun your friends in a unique 'racing' game with endless possibilities (thanks to the level editor).  To start off, the visual design of this game is absolutely fantastic- inspired by typical comic book designs and streamlined character spritework. The sound effects and overall sound design is quite nice and really fitting as well. Even though the game uses the same music while racing for the most part, they've somehow managed to make sure that it never really gets old or in the way.  The concept is simple: Run so fast that your friends get ripped into the void and explode.  With an assortment of power ups, tons of both great developer AND workshop made levels- there's almost no end to how much you can play this. Speaking of which, the level editor is great in this game and anyone interested in levels creators should take a crack at this one.  Sometimes you manage this perfect streak of constant speed, from boosters, items, slopes, and grappling (oh yes, the grappling), and it's surprising how satisfying it is to do so. Meanwhile you scream at the top of your lungs SPEEEEEEEEEEEED as your friends get torn apart by the edge of the world eating them alive.  Tons of characters with different colour palettes to choose from so that you can pick your favourite appearance, none of which affect any parameters so there's no concern of character imbalance.  If you're looking for a lighthearted racer and have some friends (preferrably around your same skill level because it DOES matter), this is a must-buy. It's on sale pretty frequently and it's generally pretty cheap too.

7897	1	a	88/100 It's a great non-violent multiplayer game, the characters are wacky and fun, and the gameplay is always intense, but it can sometimes be unfair, but the game is really fun.
7899	1	a	Multi-player is great fun either playing competitively or with friends.
7901	1	a	This game is a lot of fun if you stick with it. It has a very high learning curve but if you get over that hill, it's highly rewarding and infinitely replayable. It has good community with very few trolls/toxic players, and new players are coming in all the time.   I hope you have fun time in SpeedRunners!
7903	1	a	It's such a fun game, though make sure that when you play with other people, they have had some experience, because otherwise, it gets boring from all the complaints.
7905	1	a	Really fun game with friends, and a good way to find new friends.

7933	1	a	SpeedRunners is by far one of my favorite games. It's such an addicting game despite its simplistic look. I highly recommend it, especially with friends!!
7935	1	a	It's like if mario kart and super meat boy had a baby. Except it also brings along the frustrations of those games with it, albeait less extreme. So be prepared for that, and let the friendship tarnishing commence!
7937	1	a	  Even though I just got it like a week ago I really love it. It's amazing.
7939	1	a	is a pretty good game tbh
7941	1	a	A return to what games are supposed to be, addictive and just fun.  Speedrunners is a wonderful return to the fun platforming days of the NES. This is a quick to learn, yet difficult to master game that is simply just fun to play, and can be enjoyed in just a few minutes.   Essentially, the crux of the game is to just run and beat your competitors by being the last one still running. However, there is much the game and other players can throw at you to insure that is not always as simple as it sounds.  Gameplay is a wonderful mash-up of old-school NES platformers. Gameplay can best be described as a mix of Super Metroid, Bionic Commando and Mario Kart all rolled into one. You and three other racers (bots, online or even local games) charge through dozens of different levels jumping, ducking, sliding, avoiding boxes, swinging on grappling hooks, and shooting different weapons at other racers. In addition, the screen itself starts to slowly get smaller and you must maximize your speed and minimize mistakes. Game winners are determined by whoever wins three rounds first, and rounds themselves are over quickly, this is a great game to play if you can only dedicate a little time to gaming.   This is a fantastic game that I recommend to all.

8009	1	a	  At the time I wrote this review, I obtained it through family sharing. I have now purchased this game.  this game is wonderful. active community, great maps, exellent soundtrack (please make us able to buy the ost, i'll buy) and the gameplay? PERFECT! It's got that mario kart feeling, where even if you're 2good4quickmatch (there's a great ranked mode), you still fear for your life cuz you know that one pleb behind you might find out he has the golden claw equipped (which is like a blue shell, but more vicious), and that alone can f*ck you up real good. the items are diverse, and most of them have drawbacks (badly timed bombs can boost the ennemy, the blue sh- i mean golden claw makes you stop running when used, ect.). recently, they added trails (appears when running 2fast), i don't mind them, but some are obnoxiously large, and can distract you. (small edit: there's now an option to hide the trails)  Most content (appart from trails, i think) are locked through leveling, which i think could maybe be earned faster? (pun not itended) they also added dlc, which adds characters based on popular youtubers (ex: PewDiePie, Markiplier, ect.) and yea it's cool  as a final verdict, i rate this 5/7 (joke)  EDIT: Heard of the g 2a key fiasco. they take revenues from tinybuild, and it ain't fair. I'll buy this game ASAP, and please buy games from official sellers, like steam.

8037	1	a	Pretty great with friends, not good singleplayer. Also, make sure your friends have it too because its hella expensive.
8039	1	a	This game has been an amazingly pleasant surprise. I picked it up in a Humble Bundle and forgot about it. I had some friends over for the weekend a few weeks later and randomly remembered it. We fired it up, and proceeded to play from 8pm until 6 am. Since then, they've all picked it up and we play several times a week. The game is full of laughs and subleties you would never expect! I still find ways to go a little faster and boy does it feel good when you hit that super speed and keep it going for several screens' lengths! Play with friends and don't start without them! Learning Speedrunners alongside a group of friends and laughing it up is some of the most fun I've had in months!
8041	1	a	Very Good Game!
8043	1	a	Great game to play with friends!
8045	1	a	SpeedRunners is a fun side-scrolling game that makes me think that Indie developers could do a lot better. (No hate pls.) Cons- -No one currently plays on the multiplayer -The only DLC is youtuber DLC Pros -Works for bad computers on medium settings -The fact that this game has no flaws except for the DLC.
8047	1	a	Whether you play with your friends or againt random people on the innternet you're guarenteed to have a blast with this game. That being said, if you ever want to seriously rank up, you're going to need a lot of practice. The skill platforms between ranks in this game increase exponentially.
8049	1	a	Not gonna be able to actually enjoy it until they fix the issue where the game crashes upon loading into a level.  EDIT I found out today that the game crashes only because when I use the controller on the homescreen and pick, say, first level, when it loads it crashes cuz the difficulty option would never show up unless used with mouse. Game runs perfect now!

But with bad ranking,  but the fun overall carries the ranking systems failure. it has great coop and multiplayer.. good maps. different game modes. a lot of characters (unlocked leveling up) super awesome 'power-ups'. people rage quit and then you get XP (LOVE IT!!)  11/10

8081	1	a	My favorite game of the year!  This game seems simplistic at first but after a while, I discovered that the controls are soooo deep! You can literally spend hundred of hours perfecting your skills and you could still improve.  My favorite aspect is the weapons available. It feel a bit like Mario Kart and I love it!  The only thing I dislike is that workshop maps are part of the official ranked mode. The game should offer 2 different ranked mode: 1-Officials 2-Workshops  BUY THIS GAME

8087	1	a	Fast Pace and very fun game :D
8089	1	a	Great game, intense as sh*t. Recommended to play with friends, preferably on a large tv screen in a couch with hand controllers. But online is fun too.
8091	1	a	Very good game, works on slow computers pretty well. A few glitches, but its still a great game. Reccomend it to people who are bored and have friends that can play as well. Worth the cost, may look dumb, gameplay a bit repetitive, but very fun when you are able to match other players skills.  9/10 not IGN try it out, refund if you disliked it  
8093	1	a	Great game to play with your friends. 11/10 would speedrun again.
8095	1	a	conpetitive but very fun

8099	1	a	Fast Pace and very fun game :D
8101	1	a	Not alone do you need skill, but you need to memorize the maps. Muscle memory is key, but complete and utter focus are too. If you're looking for a top end, critical game, this ones for you.

8105	1	a	  This game...  uhh...  Friendship breaker  the good : + Simple and fun + Many characters + steam workshop for custom level + 4-players with game-pad + more players more fun  the bad : - hardly find player online - bug occurs when lagging - less players less fun

8119	1	a	 Early Access Review
8121	1	a	A very fun game reminiscent of Running Wild, but unfortunatley hamppered by some of the most unbalanced ranked multiplayer I've ever experienced. I recomend only if you don't care about online rankings or leaderboards.
8123	1	a	This game is awesome, so you should try it (my son, age 5).

8133	1	a	this games 2fast5me. i like it. also im good so get it.
8135	1	a	Its a realy fun game to me and i recomend you to use a controlerand the story mode is short, but fun.
8137	1	a	More Fun Than You Think.
8139	1	a	love this game i am so addicted
8141	1	a	I give it a 10/10 you get the most out of it playing with friends.
8143	1	a	  Great game! In this game you simply just try to run faster than your opponent. It´s very fun with friends. Power ups are awesome. Some players are salty but it doesn´t matter. It´s not a pay to win game. You can unlock skins and characters by leveling up. There can be little bit glitches but it doesn´t affect the gameplay a lot.. I recommend this game for all kinds of players. If you don´t have friends... GET SOME FRIENDS TO PLAY THIS GAME WITH!
8145	1	a	Speed Runners is anamazing game that grasps so many concepts.When you look at the game and watch some videos about it you think that it will get boring, YOUR WRONG. This game is amazing because of how many characters there are and how competitive it is when you do ranked matches. If you don't like competitive matches then you can always just do quickplay which is casual and is fun. I love in the game how it has so many characters and all of them are so unique. I also like how there are so many different power ups this allowing you to be almost blown up but then to grab somebody and replace them in your spot. As you get better in the game you master the ways of shortcuts allowing you to be dead last and then end up being first. Trust me get this game. Even though this game is worth the 16 dollars this type of game should be 10 dollars. If you are unsure about buying then wait and get it on the next sale it is worth it. 9.99/10 because of price
8147	1	a	I love this game :3
8149	1	a	Unicors is named Unic 17/10
8151	1	a	It is a nice Fast Pace Game which will make you play it non-stop! I really enjoyed the game and I Reccoment it to you all! the game is Getting alot of updates every now and then and will hopefully come out as an awesome polished game!
8153	1	a	Fast-paced ruin your friendships game, I do love this game but my friends get mad at me for it. I got it on steam sale and got 4 copies for my friends(including me) for only 3.75$ each! thats like, 15$! I love the roullette wheel and my fav character is the blue speedrunner (River Runner) because he looks like sonic. The gmae is good and I really like it, i always get my friend to play but he says we will end up not being friends if we do.
8155	1	a	Easy to pick up, and a ton of fun to play with friends. It's a game where you can have a quick 15 minute session or hours.
8157	1	a	Well considering the ammount of hours I have on this account and the other one I'm pretty sure I have enough experience to write a review.  This game is pretty much Mariokart on foot and is both casual and competitive PROS  -Matches usually last around a good 5-10 minutes depending on skill level -Very live community and devs (as of writing) -Very little toxicity in public games -A lot of help from the community and devs -A LOT of fun  Now for the cons -In a public match if you get matched up with someone with bad connection can ruin your fun -Some hitreg issues on the golden hook (I.E you slide and the golden hook passes you, and you still get hooked) -Can get stale after 50-60 hours for some people  TL;DR Its a good game but some bad flaws 7/10 overall
8159	1	a	Lose friends in this game because it's too fun to ruin friendship. Play with everyone have different feeling. Great game and worth to buy with friends or alone.
8161	1	a	Now this is one of the most fun and exciting games I've ever played, you race against 3 players by running, sliding and swinging through various obstacles in a map, to win you have to be the last man standing, you have to get run and get ahead of the players and forcing other them to go off screen to eliminate them, there are lots of maps from the game, but the best part is that you can also play maps from steam workshop! So the fun is basically endless! :)
8163	1	a	Like Sanic said one time :  u gotta go fast  fast/10, needs to go more fast.

8175	1	a	love this game i am so addicted
8177	1	a	A great fun game if you want to play casual with your friends or a challenging and harsh experience if you'd rather dive into the competitive aspect. It's worth of your time if you enjoy fast-paced games with quick matches. Recommended

8193	1	a	Multi-player is great fun either playing competitively or with friends.
8195	1	a	  Even though I just got it like a week ago I really love it. It's amazing.

8213	1	a	Really fun and competitive I think it is better when you have friends to play it with so if you have a friend who owns this game then I think it is a must have.
8215	1	a	 Early Access Review
8217	1	a	  This is a pretty fun game to play, especially when you are playing with friends. The chapters in the game get challenging when you move up the difficulty. Multiplayer is pretty fun as well although I would prefer playing with friends. If you need a game that you can play with your friends and have fun or possibly ruin friendships, I would recommend giving this game a go.
8219	1	a	Run rush b dont stop
8221	1	a	I hate the triple boxes Dx
8223	1	a	One of the funniest games out there to play with friends. You won't regret playing this masterpiece.
8225	1	a	Games consist of the following -Troll your friends -Troll other players -Use skills everytime -Be the secret characters  Yeah I love it!
8227	1	a	If you need local activity, buy this game. Plain and simple. I cannot even review the 1 player because I've never played haha. This is one of the ultimate couch gaming experiences. I can play with my 8yr son or my 30 year old fiance. This is a great game for all ages that never gets old. I would even pay full price!
8229	1	a	Great game to play with your friends. 11/10 would speedrun again.
8231	1	a	Very Very Goood. Fun to play with friends
8233	1	a	Extremely addicting and incredibly fun both offline and online.  Loads of in game content to unlock to keep you occupied.
8235	1	a	Can confirm this game will make you hate your friends
8237	1	a	lots of fun
8239	1	a	Great competitive game which is extremely fun with friends, however if you are looking to play online and win, be prepared to practice lots.
8241	1	a	Steam sale almost over? Got 4 bucks burnin a hole in your wallet? This game is for you.
8243	1	a	An amazing game to play with friends, however the progression system is a little lacking. I've always been one for games with set, obtainable achievments like unlockable things, and this doesn't fit those requirements. However if you want to have a great time just messing around with amazing controls, this is the game for you!
8245	1	a	 Early Access Review
8247	1	a	10/10 Would smash my friends into the toilet again
8249	1	a	BEST GAME EVER!!! Playing with friends makes the game more fun than playing it solo.
8251	1	a	Very nice, and fun game!. played it all day long
8253	1	a	GOTTA GO FAST BOI!!!!!!  Never was it easier to lose your friends over a game, since monopoly
8255	1	a	SUMMARY Speedrunners can be really fun as long as you have friends to play with. If you play with your friends, 15e is totally worth cause you can spend a lot of time in it. However if you play it solo, this game actually quite sucks.  88/100  PROS - amazing and fun to listen soundtrack - gameplay is really fun - graphics are simple ( low hw needs ) but they look good - the game has its own physics which make sense and are creative  CONS - the game sometimes doesn´t respect even its physics - I experienced many bugs and internet connection issues which made the game unplayable - almost unplayle on keyboard ( controller needed )
8257	1	a	Fun addictive local multiplayer game. Great for parties. Simple mechanics, but hard to master.
8259	1	a	Never main cat boy, because if you do Saint Nickolas will haunt you forever for taking his main.   Other than that, The game is great and you will definantly enjoy it as long as you dont get grabbed and lose the whole game and kys. 8/10 Would buy this game
8261	1	a	Great game, one of the best coop games I played !
8263	1	a	Advice: You can duck the Golden Hook
8265	1	a	This game is like drugs. Using it for a long time gives you super powers
8267	1	a	It's literally just a game about going ♥♥♥♥ing fast. Also has items to screw over your opponents. Has workshop support, mostly for maps. It also has plenty of maps to choose from in the vanilla game. The only negative about this game is that it puts the 1st place runner on a disadvantage, because of the way the camera works. So basically, The first place runner will have a smaller field of view than all the other runners.  Edit: also, you get lots of skins throughout the game as you level up. They're really cool. I think they're 70% of the things that make me keep playing the game, to be honest.
8269	1	a	hey that's pretty good
8271	1	a	Very fun game. Simple concept/mechanics but the multiplayer really makes it shine. easy to get hooked.
8273	1	a	Let me just say right out of the gate, this game is awful. First, the bad...  The starting controls are awful, the game begins by dumping you in a random match where changing said controls is.. impossible, the menus are meh and a few other basic gamey 'things' aren't up to par. However, once you get past these little hiccups, you're going to have a rocking good time. I love this game because it's a simple, easy game to play with friends. The characters are great, I love the designs, and the levels have a good curve of easy to challenging. Getting this game was a great investment, but you'll want to find someone else on your friends list to play it with you. While there are public matches out there, beware, you will get stomped.
8275	1	a	very cool game, much more fun with friends tho
8277	1	a	Good game, but i never played in the multiplayer zone.
8279	1	a	Amazing and fun game to play with friends, innovative maps and items. Still, I think the price is a bit too high.
8281	1	a	Speed runners is a fun and good time waster game fun to play with friends and it take forever to find a game but its a old game but you have people still playing it.
8283	1	a	One of my all time favorite games! I never get tired of playing it! It may be a little bit old now but it can run even on a potato (crap computer)!
8285	1	a	this game gets seriously intense so strap on ur big boy pants and lets get rumblin' boys
8287	1	a	Fun game, but, be warned, there are many pro players, and they will completely destroy you, but otherwise, the game is great! story is lame, but, who cares, it is entertainingly silly 
8289	1	a	Really fun party game!   Now I need friends....
8291	1	a	very cool game, much more fun with friends tho
8293	1	a	If you like games such as Super Meat Boy and Dust Force you're gonna love this game!
8295	1	a	Fun game. Great game to play with friends. 8/10
8297	1	a	Awesome game to play with friends, has depth, great gameplay and is tons of fun, what else to say?
8299	1	a	A very fun competitive platformer!

8311	1	a	Easy to pick up, hard to master...
8313	1	a	really fun
8315	1	a	This game was recommended to me by a friend. They actually purchased it for me because I was skeptical. I have played 4hrs in and I can't stop playing it. It is 8:36AM and I still have not slept. This game is so suprisingly fun. Playing with friends is awesome while trash talking each other over VOIP. I recommend it to everyone to try it out.
8317	1	a	Gave me a virus, Called tech support, Got scammed.  Would do it again 10/10  
8319	1	a	I am very pleased with this game it is a very simple game and is very relaxing while also beign very competitive .
8321	1	a	is sonic fast
8323	1	a	This game makes you wanna go again and again and again...  Cant wait to see what the final product will be like, since it still in beta, althougt they add new content from time to time.  Great game for you and three friends, really competetive. Love it. Worth a buy.
8325	1	a	This game has been an amazingly pleasant surprise. I picked it up in a Humble Bundle and forgot about it. I had some friends over for the weekend a few weeks later and randomly remembered it. We fired it up, and proceeded to play from 8pm until 6 am. Since then, they've all picked it up and we play several times a week. The game is full of laughs and subleties you would never expect! I still find ways to go a little faster and boy does it feel good when you hit that super speed and keep it going for several screens' lengths! Play with friends and don't start without them! Learning Speedrunners alongside a group of friends and laughing it up is some of the most fun I've had in months!
8327	1	a	Voted for the Test of Time reward because all way from beta to now and even before i owned the game ive loved it and kept playing :D
8329	1	a	Great game. Workshop really shines with this game!
8331	1	a	This game is amazing with a group of friends, especially when you get super agile!

8335	1	a	Most fun I've had with co-op, can't say anything else about it lol
8337	1	a	A lot of fun with friends, but once you go down the path of 'competitive' its gonna be a tough ride.
8339	1	a	I nominated Speedrunners, because I have a lot of fun, while playing this with my friends.
8341	1	a	The most valuable party game on the market.. fast, dynamic and funny to play with friends! Thumbs up!
8343	1	a	GOD! it's addicting!
8345	1	a	One of the best games to play with your friends on the big screen. Over 10 hours of competetive fun!
8347	1	a	Probably one of the funnest reliable party game to play with your friends online or at home. Night Club/10
8349	1	a	It's fun, I think. Run, still run before you get off the screen. If you can't, you will AFK to give 0 XP to your opponents, it's good choice for you too.
8351	1	a	 Early Access Review
8353	1	a	It's what it says in the title, watch 10 seconds of gameplay and you get the premise. It's my thing so I like it, I know a lot of people who hate it.
8355	1	a	This game is fast pace, like the name it said. A really fun game to mess around with other online player or friends. its fast pace, fun, and you can play it over and over again.  overall, its a good game to mess around with other friends.
8357	1	a	My porsche suck my dog ♥♥♥♥ like a rainbow leporcond
8359	1	a	Great game to play with friends!
8361	1	a	Speedrunners is hands down the greatest game of all time.
8363	1	a	  This game was cool in the oldest beta versions but now isn't the beta was more fun btw in my opinion but it's cool when you play only with friends to me avcourse !!!
8365	1	a	Not gonna be able to actually enjoy it until they fix the issue where the game crashes upon loading into a level.  EDIT I found out today that the game crashes only because when I use the controller on the homescreen and pick, say, first level, when it loads it crashes cuz the difficulty option would never show up unless used with mouse. Game runs perfect now!
8367	1	a	 Early Access Review
8369	1	a	'twas fun
8371	1	a	I'm not a man of many words, nor am I really good at writing reviews, but this is a good game, so I figured I should do this.  It's basically a 2D Mario Kart with a grappling hook mechanic that allows you to abuse the power of PHYSICS for more momentum, and therefore more speed.  You should buy it, it's like 15 bucks man.
8373	1	a	SpeedRunners is a hype game and a unique one, a kind of game you don't see on the market and will never see again on this kind of scale.  First things first; get used to those slippery controls. I grew fond of them over time, but be aware of the controls. You'll slip and slide everywhere!  Second, this game offers a large variety of characters that, while they don't have any unique powers, consist of things like a DINOSAUR, a CRAZY WITCH CAT GIRL, and yes...OCTODAD. If Octodad doesn't sell this game for you I can't help you.  Third, if you're still reading, the game has many interesting and cool maps to try and memorize that always have some challenge for newcomers and veterans alike. They're all very fun, and have colorful imagery and effects.  Overall, SpeedRunners is a 9/10 in my book. It's extremely fun, and great to play with friends. However, characters should have unique powers, and that's really my only critique. Go and buy it now that it's out of Beta!
8375	1	a	Perty neato
8377	1	a	It's a fun party game, both online and locally. The 'youtuber' DLC is pretty much cancer, though.
8379	1	a	its a blast to play with friends
8381	1	a	I've shared many laughs and glorious kills/deaths with my friends on Skype while playing. It's very simple at a glance, but under the surface, there is a lot of strategy and skill. We have slowly been picking up on little techniques to squeak out even faster runs. Great game!  10/10 Would drop boxes on my friend's heads again.
8383	1	a	The most valuable party game on the market.. fast, dynamic and funny to play with friends! Thumbs up!

8415	1	a	Fun little game to play with friends, easy to play and hard to master, worth the money 100%
8417	1	a	It's pretty ok, but don't go in expecting much. Characters are bland and story is short.

8423	1	a	Best party game ever
8425	1	a	It`s kinda fine, but being good at the game takes a lot of practicing. It`s fine, yeah.
8427	1	a	SpeedRunners continues to be one of my favorite games to load up and play casually. It's great for parties, competitive spirit, and being ridicously fast.  Everytime I go back to this game, the developer has improved some weird thing which was a problem last time I played. The level updates looks slick, and the sound design gets the blood pumping.  Keep up the amazing work.
8429	1	a	Best game when you want to loose your friends.
8431	1	a	running simulator.... cool
8433	1	a	One of the best games I have played yet. If you like skillbased 2D jump n' run multiplayer racing games, this is probably the only option you have you picky *******
8435	1	a	Cheap fun addictive game!
8437	1	a	fun game !! and it can make you addict ! play with your friend will be more fun xD
8439	1	a	For a multiplayer race game, it's really good.
8441	1	a	A ton of fun to play with friends, similar laughs and stiff competition had playing Speedrunners, as had playing Super Smash Bros.
8443	1	a	Fun to play locally with friends
8445	1	a	Well , i gotta say speedrunners it's a really great game , you can start it off by playing with friends i really recommad you startin' this way.But still after a while you're gonna meet players which are better than you and thats gonna make you say 'Holy ♥♥♥♥ i wanna be fast as he is' then the game starts gettin' competitive , there are lots of mods , trails and character skin's that you can download or create your own.You should really try out this game cause it's just amazing. The only con about this game is , it ain't that populated , i wish youtubers would gave this game a chance because it deserves it! I only see from 200 to 500-600 players a day and that makes me sad cause on sale this game made up to 8000 players and it was just amazing. Anyway give it a try it's amazing and btw it's gonna make you rage and ♥♥♥♥-off badly! Have fun playin!

8451	1	a	A lot of fun, especially in ranked. I would reccomend buying the 4-Pack to play with your friends.
8453	1	a	  This key was obtained from a developer for purposes of a review
8455	1	a	Due to its simple nature, but vast depth, I hereby give SpeedRunners the title of the best designed multiplayer game I have ever played.
8457	1	a	  This game is so good I am happy for playing this game And Update maps,character and weapon is so amazing
8459	1	a	This game is great if you're looking for either a fun way to pass the time or want to have some fun with your friends, along with that this game has a lot of replay ability so the purchase is defiantly worth it
8461	1	a	It's pretty ok, but don't go in expecting much. Characters are bland and story is short.
8463	1	a	A lot of laugh, taunt, argument, protest in fun way with my friends playing this.. Love it...
8465	1	a	  Pretty good game
8467	1	a	good game for multiplayer
8469	1	a	  This key was obtained from a developer for purposes of a review
8471	1	a	Great game, always good with a few mates.
8473	1	a	Awesome, you can see this game and just look at it 'Oh it's trash.' But seriously it really isn't. I normally don't write reviews but this game is just that Awesome. - FaCe Halo
8475	1	a	Probably one of the best online party games available on PC at the moment. Would probably be awesome to play on a steambox in your parents living room with friends.
8477	1	a	It's pretty ok, but don't go in expecting much. Characters are bland and story is short.
8479	1	a	Great game to pass the time and challenge your friends.  Warning: Salt levels may rise
8481	1	a	'COME ON, WHY ME!?'  -Me everytime.
8483	1	a	;)
8485	1	a	Fast paced multiplayer game that is really fun to play with friends.
8487	1	a	Superspeedrunners mode is the one man...... never too fast.
8489	1	a	Best multiplayer game for any occasion 8/8 no debate :P
8491	1	a	i have a joy,it's a game that make me feel crazy.
8493	1	a	First off, this is one of the most intense games I have played. The platforming is rock solid, the grappling hooks are perferctly implemented, and the powerups aren't too overpowered. The game is well balanced, and even if you are behind, you can catch up in a flash. It's incredibly easy to pick up and go, and practice makes perfect. Even though this is still in early access, it has very few bugs, with the exception of occasional lag, which is to be expected. Easily one of the best multiplayer experiences I've had. Also, the characters are wonderfully weird, and the game doesn't take itself too seriously, which is something triple A games have a big problem with. Buy this game right now, you will not be disappointed. Plus, it's only $15, which is a steal. Start your speedrunning, grappling hooking, ice beaming, box dropping escapades today! 9.5/10.
8495	1	a	Destroy friendships in a fun way.
8497	1	a	Great game to pass the time and challenge your friends.  Warning: Salt levels may rise
8499	1	a	IF UR HANDS ARENT SWEATY THEN UR NOT PLAYING IT RIGHT!
8501	1	a	running simulator.... cool
8503	1	a	i have a joy,it's a game that make me feel crazy.
8505	1	a	VERY fun! Good with friends, fun online, and amazing controller support. This isnt even a car game, and it's still probably my favorite racing game of all time!
8507	1	a	For a multiplayer race game, it's really good.
8509	1	a	simple, fun party game
8511	1	a	This is absolutely my favourite game of all time. It's extremely fun to play with your friends and it has so much unlockable content that it just makes you want to continue playing, which is a good thing, of course! There's a storymode now aswell, and that adds alot of replay-value. However, the characters don't have any specific characteristics that ultimately changes the gameplay. They're just there for cosmetic utilities. It's arguably one of the best competetive game out there.  I highly recommend it to everybody out there!
8513	1	a	wish community was bigger, but lots of fun!
8515	1	a	I really love this game. It has so much to unlock so you always have a reason to play. I don't play it all the time, but its always a game I go back to when I don't know what else to do.
8517	1	a	Fun if you want a 2d Mario Kart on legs, or if you're really good and like taunting your friends.  Darnit, Tony.
8519	1	a	I MUST PROCEDE AT A HIGH VELOCITY. Gud Game.
8521	1	a	//100%
8523	1	a	Bast Game Eva! 4 pack rulez. You aer friends gonna love you!   *** Addictive *** (very)
8525	1	a	Awesome game to play with friends... if you have any left after few games.
8527	1	a	One the best friendship killers ever... Otherwise very funny, competitive and challenging game. There are some bugs, but they are being fixed asap. Definitley something to buy and if your friends owns it to, then you have a lot of play/fun-time ahead.
8529	1	a	I really love this game. It has so much to unlock so you always have a reason to play. I don't play it all the time, but its always a game I go back to when I don't know what else to do.
8531	1	a	Too Gud For Bronze Too Bad 4 Silver. WPWP
8533	1	a	Fun if you want a 2d Mario Kart on legs, or if you're really good and like taunting your friends.  Darnit, Tony.
8535	1	a	CHANGE MY WHOLE ♥♥♥♥♥♥ LIFE &lt;3
8537	1	a	 Early Access Review
8539	1	a	I wouldnt recommend it alone, but with either local co-op or online with friends it's a blast.
8541	1	a	Great game
8543	1	a	  as of the time of writing i've not put much time in the game but it's a really fun game and is best with friends
8545	1	a	This is a fast and enjoyable game to play with friends and say 'i can do it faster than you' and it matters
8547	1	a	10/10, would tackle/box again. top meme ;]
8549	1	a	Comes close to the most fun I've ever had couch-playing. It's a great party game: + fun + 2-5 minutes per game (can change players quickly so it doesn't get boring for anyone) + ultra easy to learn + impossible to master + so much to unlock  but not a perfect game: - laggy online multiplayer - few online players - story is just an extra long tutorial - Trails are way to expensive  I personally wouldn't buy it as single player or online multiplayer game. For couch multiplayer it's a MUST-HAVE though!
705	0	a	After 70 plus hours in this game, I can confidently admit the game is broken. I can't recommend it in its current state. The game is dazzling to look at, and the sound design is nothing short of incredible with my Soundblaster Z sound card. The feel of the tracks are authentic, making it as if I'm really there. However, the game has a fatal flaw, which results in frustration and ultimate dissatisfaction. The penalty system in the game is simply too stringent. Codemasters said the issue was fixed in F1 2013, but it makes me wonder why they don't patch/fix the issue in this game.   There is nothing more frustrating to be trapped in a group of cars bunched in a corner, and getting a drive through penalty for 'illegal blocking.' Or a car driven by the AI bumping up against you, and acquiring another drive through penalty for unsportsmanlike behavior. I just spent an hour and a half in a race with 28 laps to go, and accrued two such flags in one lap. That pretty much guaranteed a last place finish. This needs to be fixed.
8551	1	a	An entertaining F1 game, that brings you the intensity of a F1 race and the graphics to back it up. Although, the unaware A.I. and the infuriatingly broken penalty system keep this game from being a top tier racer. ~7.9/10  Pros: -Good Co-Op Career -Graphics are good -Physics and feel of the cars are good Cons: -A.I. -Damage System -Penalty System  All in all, a fun and competitive racing game. 
8553	1	a	Does it add lots to the previous years instalment? Not particularly. The game does feel considerably snappier though. Some issues like the AI still being a little stupid can be irksome, but such minor complains will not stop you liking the game. If you like driving games buy it while its on sale, if you follow F1 and don't already have this game buy it NOW.
8555	1	a	Dark Souls with wheels
8557	1	a	A good game but the penalty sistem is really annoying! It gives penaltys to the player for minor incidents and other cars are forgiven for bumping you hard. And the pit exit of some tracks is bugged because the game gives a penalty for crossing the pit-lane line, when the car is still controlled by the AI. I have to save rewinds for that moment for not, my race is going down hard. These kind of issues are gamebreaking, at least for me, but overall i recommend the game for the fans of F1 (if they can pass over little flaws)!!!
8559	1	a	 An evolution of F1 2011, with more features and less yellow filters.   F1 2012 is a game about Formula One cars and driving them.  Although with a slightly controversial change of not making the player feel like a part of the paddock anymore but rather presenting everything in a simplified main menu, it continues to innovate on the set formula (pun definitely intended) and throws more features into the mix, like the 'Young Driver Test' taking place before the start of your career, or the 'Champions Mode' putting you up against six World Champions in multiple challenges to test your skills.  The cars do feel great to drive, and the number of modes to play makes the game even more interesting for sure. It is a brilliant game altogether, and I definitely have had huge amounts of fun with it.
8561	1	a	I've enjoyed every minute of the game so far. And this is coming from someone who isn't a die-hard fan of F1. It appeals to the casual gamer as well. It's not arcady, but still thoroughly enjoyable.   Pros:
8563	1	a	Major improvements over F1 2011. No more clunking on my G27. At the time of this review f1 2012 is still a cheap acceptable alternative to F1 2013 if you dont mind being out of date.
8565	1	a	What an incredible racing game and this is coming from someone who didn't appreciate F1.  The graphics are pretty even by 2016's standard. At first I couldn't compete in qualifying against AI which put me in the last position consistently. Then I started to learn the tracks better and I began to improve in qualifying sessions. 19th out of 24, 18th, 7th, then eventually 1st and 2nd!! The reward feeling is incredible as you win your races.  In career mode you have to also master your race strategy which means knowing which tire set to choose and when to go to pit. Temperatures of brakes and tires are simulated so if they are cold you will find yourself sliding in corners. As I started to do well in dry races, I encountered another challenge in the dynamic weather. When it gets from sunshine to rain, you need to time your pit wisely to change tire set. New tires are cold and take time to adjust to the rythm of racing so you can't just push your car mindlessly. I struggled bad when weather turns from dry to wet until I learned when to pull a pit stop and to watch out for the temperatures of both my brakes and tires.  Again, this is a beautiful F1 game that's pretty with immersive sound effects. You can feel the competitiveness from the AI. Whoever coded the AI deserves a medal!  Buy this even if you just have a slight interest in F1.  UPDATE July 13th 2016 After I bought F1 2013 which is deemed by many to be the best F1 title from Codemasters yet, I'm loving F1 2012 even more. While F1 2013 is a bit prettier than F1 2012, it suffers from water spray not being shown in replays. I often record my games and post the videos on Youtube as a personal album of sort and this water spray bug bugs me very much especially from an F1 title vaunted very much to be the best yet from Codemasters. F1 2013 AI is also much tougher and I simply cannot keep up with the AI. In races where I could get into podium in F1 2012, I must settle with 5th-6th place instead in F1 2013. Some people may like the tougher AI but not me. Thus, F1 2012 is very much the more accessible game. As for the vaunted handling of F1 2013, I found it to be an overstatement. Cars in F1 2013 may be more twitchy at slow speeds but that doesn't necessarily make them more realistic....only more difficult to control at slow speeds. High speed handling in F1 2013 is on par with F1 2012 if not slightly more arcade (easier to drive). I regret buying F1 2013 at full price in fact because of the marginal value it has over F1 2012 which I bought for very cheap. Aside from the lackluster DLCs F1 2013 has no obvious edge over F1 2012. Certainly nothing to justify buying it at full price considering Codemasters has maintained the F1 2013 at full price for 2 years without any discount whatsoever being offered.  Here's a little comparison between F1 games that I own: F1 2012: Great value, great handling physics, capable but not overwhelming AI (AI is at the sweetest spot imo), a minor bug in helmet visor texture, still looks good for 2016's standard, cars have V8 engine with awesome sound and you get to race as or with Michael Schumacher (2012 is his final racing year)  F1 2013: Bad value since it's not been discounted for couple years now, at slow speeds the cars are more twitchy while at higher speeds the cars feel a tiny bit more arcade than F1 2012, rather overwhelming AI that can shock new players, bug: AI water spray isn't being shown in replay, a bit prettier than F1 2012, cars have V8 engine with awesome sound though there's no longer Michael Schumacher in the game, DLCs allow you to race in 1980s and 1990s F1 cars although the track and team lists are lacking.  F1 2014: Good value when discounted, handling is quite a bit more arcade compared to previous iterations and suffers from understeer, good AI that's not as overwhelming as F1 2013, bug: AI water spray isn't being shown in replay, prettier than F1 2013, all teams are unlocked from the start in career mode so you don't have to start in a low tier team, has unlimited replay option that alleviates any worry of you ruining a race due to short lapses of concentration, cars have new turbocharged V6 engine with underwhelming sound...
8567	1	a	Now I'm not that into the F1 yearly game thing, but my god is this game fun. At first it was the most difficult thing in the world because learning how to do it was completely new to me. I just had no clue on how to do it and would be doing pretty bad. Then I slowly got better and boy is it satisfying to start to win things.    This game makes the racing and winning so enjoyable! Normally in the Dirt series the winning just doesn't feel great but in this game it feels like I accomplished something. This is pretty much the biggest reason why I am reccomending this game.
8569	1	a	Got the Knockout Edition and its okay. Unfortunately no one living to play against.
8571	1	a	Kinda disgusted at this crappy attempt to make a few more bucks with little effort done to do it properly.  The lack of a tutorial mode or even a manual meant I spent ages working out how to teleport more players into a game and eventually I found out how through an online forum.  In saying that, you can get past that part eventually by just learning on your own. What really grated me was the misleading comment about playing against the computer ai. That is total bulls**t. The only option to playing against the ai is a lame exhibition mode, unlike the bloodbowl series where you have proper single player campaigns.  Don't waste your money on this one.
8573	1	a	Quite good, if you like running in caves
706	0	a	0/10 DO NOT BUY! IF SOMEBODY GIVES YOU A COPY, IT STILL ISN'T WORTH IT! The main problem with this game is that it is a multi-player only game with dead servers. Which means that people paid money to sit in a lobby waiting for somebody to show up. They never do. Save your money and buy Blood Bowl instead, a game with a solid single-player mode AND a healthy multiplayer community. Add into the mix how many teams have been cut out just so they can be sold back to you at a stupid rate, and you have the worst purchase ever on Steam EDIT: This review was written before the 'Knockout' edition came out 'too little, too late' I haven't seen the new version because the DRM only allows limited downloads, and since I replaced my PC I've not been able to activate it. Take from that what you will.
707	0	a	 043/100   The game comes with no in-game manual.  I hope you already know how to play Dungeonbowl! Oh you don't?  Well you are out of luck then.  2 Years after release a 1 player mode was  finally  added. Hey, better late than never right? And all the DLC is now included for free. What more could you ask for? Deserves a thumbs up right?  WRONG!  Dungeonbowl is a game about managing  your  team, customing  your  team and playing matches with  your  team.  So what we thought what we would do is, in 1 player mode you can't use  your  team and instead have to choose a pre-made team thus removing the WHOLE POINT OF MAKING YOUR OWN TEAM! Oh and no progress is saved for that pre-selected team either!  I just...  NO!  Join Grumpy reviews for all your gaming needs  http://steamcommunity.com/groups/grumpyreviews 
708	0	a	Awful. You can only play online. Team creation process is painful. The interface is bad. Blood bowl is awesome. Dungeonbowl sucks.
709	0	a	A really poorly realised version of the board game. Avoid at all costs.
710	0	a	This game is a cheap money grab with no effort put into it.  Atrociouse. Deplorable. Cyanide should commit sepuku for this game.
711	0	a	Lacking a single-player, customization of the game-length and options to continue, this shouldn't be held in any regard to any incarnation of Blood Bowl. Save your money, get Blood Bowl and enjoy a completed game.
712	0	a	Since the update there have been some changes, but my opinion on whether it is worth it or not is still the same. I will admit I am glad they got rid of the outrageous dlc and added some ai, but the has changed very little. The single player is shallow with only allowing the player to choose pre-selected teams with no team custimization of any kind. The multiplayer online for all intensive purposes is still dead, and the online ai teams kinda break the whole purpose of online multiplayer. Glad it changed but still not worth it.
713	0	a	I am of the rare breed that prefers Dungeonbowl to Blood Bowl; after extensively playing and enjoying the tabletop game, I waited for this game to be on sale. Purchasing it I was initially impressed with the game play but frustrated with the difficulties in finding an opponent. I made teams to match my tabletop ones which won consistently but here this was not the case. I pressed on assuming that I did not have the skill and it took me time to get used to the interface. I eventually realized that my gameplay had little to do with it: the rules were subtlety different and at times broken, such as game duration limit and no blitzing off a teleport. The final blow for me was the Dwarven Deathroller which in my opinion is so broken that I have caught myself swearing at my monitor at least forty times. All other 'big guys' have a detriment skill like take root, really dumb, etc. but not this beast. I calculated that teams I played against that did not have a Deathroller, I won &gt;65% of games while if they did have one, I would win less than 20% of the time.   Why not make a team with a Deathroller, Trou? My answer: why not make a game that is at least reasonably balanced?  I am able to look passed a lot of this game's flaws that are stated here in these accurate reviews but combined together with this diarrhea on top, I would not recommend this game even if you love the table top version like I do.   Jepumk said it best: it is a poorly realized version of the table top game.
714	0	a	Don't even try it. As a fan of the Bloodbowl Game, I thought this couldn't be too bad despite the the negative reviews, right? I won't regurgitate the comments already posted in the negative reviews, but I will add that once installed, it will not uninstall correctly, just launches the game every time you try to delete local content.
715	0	a	Altho I really like Bloodbowl (Have only been playing it for about 15 years) and I adore Dungeonbowl, this iteration of the game I can not endorse. It lacks polish. It lacks flair. It lacks a decent AI, UI and single player campaign. Seeing how the campaign works in regular BB, I don't see why Cyanide couldn't let the player make a single player team. Instead you can only play offline with premade teams. Kinda missed the mark, by a mile or two...
716	0	a	this is not a game, is a bad DLC for bloodbowl sold pretending it to be a full game. Which it is not.  this is a complete crap for many reasons.  1) It's an online-only game, no single player or AI of any sort, there's not even a tutorial, nothing. you sit in the lobby waiting for a player to show up for hours, and when it does, the connection is bugged and the challenge system doesn't work.  2) the game itself is just bloodbowl with walls. good? nope. because the nice and functional free camera that worked as a charm in bloodbowl, here is cramped and unfunctional. you will not understand a ♥♥♥♥ of what is going on in the match, because there will always be a wall in your way.  3) the game comes with a super-♥♥♥♥♥♥ third-party DRM which gives you a total of 3 activations. this means that if you uninstall this game 3 times, the 4th time you can just throw it in the toilet, because it won't work.   STAY AWAY FROM THIS ♥♥♥♥. GO PLAY BLOODBOWL INSTEAD.
717	0	a	In the kindest and gentlest way I can think of, or at least, the way that uses the fewest expletivies, I will attempt to review this game. The short version and all that you probably care about is the fact that... it SUCKS!!! Ok, with that said you can stop reading or continue if you want details. First off, this game is online, LAN, or hotseat only. No singleplayer. Yep, Multiplayer only. Also the interface is terrible, the sound is underwhelming, and the dungeon creator is abhorrent. The only redeeming factor seems to be that the character models are interesting. I am a fan of Cyanide and enjoy Games Workshop, but this game is crap. The only thing keeping me from being disappointed in this game is the fact that I got it as part of a Bundlestar deal where I paid less than $1.00 USD for it.
718	0	a	Found it next to impossible to get a game, and when you did, human oposition ruined the game
719	0	a	garbage online multi only no single or campain
720	0	a	Dungeonbowl is not quite unplayable, but I regret spending money on it. Singleplayer is nonexistent, but Multiplayer sucks. Get Blood Bowl instead.
721	0	a	Love Bloodbowl, hated this. Wanted to like it but it's not a very good game. Plus playing against the AI can end in a stalemate which isn't fun either.
722	0	a	This game has no AI, and no single-player gameplay. I do *NOT* recommend this game! DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!
723	0	a	nope. Multiplayer only and nobody to play with. No suprise. It sucks
724	0	a	Another one of those small multiplayer only titles. So nobody plays. Making the game useless. It also has annoying online activation drm. Just avoid this crap.
725	0	a	Strongly recommend that you do not buy this. You won't find anyone online to play against. There's no single player campaign, only single skirmishes against AI. Its not worth even a dollar. One of the worst games I've ever purchased. Stick with Blood Bowl.
726	0	a	I like the idea of dungeon bowl more than the execution. This should be an add on for the general game and not a solo release. Undecided if I actually like it at all now.
727	0	a	It just wasn't fun. I'm a big bloodbowl fan, but this was disappointing.
728	0	a	Multiplayer is dead so all you are getting are bot matches with no story or progression system at all. Just get Blood Bowl 2
729	0	a	I can't explain how poor this game is, but I can say one word: BORING!
730	0	a	I don't know what this game was trying to do but I played it for 5 seconds and quit. Probably one of those games that's outdated enough to be unplayable minus nostalgia factor.

732	0	a	Richard Walter Zisk (born February 6, 1949) is a retired Major League Baseball player currently in charge of pro scouting in Florida for the Chicago Cubs.[1]Zisk was drafted by the Pittsburgh Pirates out of Seton Hall University in the third round of the 1967 Major League Baseball Draft, and made his major league debut on September 8, 1971 replacing Roberto Clemente in right field in the eighth inning of Pittsburgh's 10-1 victory over the Chicago Cubs, and got a single in his first major league at-bat.[2] Zisk also made seventeen appearances with the 1972 Pirates, however, he was not on either team's post-season roster.  In Zisk's rookie season, 1973, he batted .324 with ten home runs. On June 9, 1974, he hit for the cycle in a 14-1 victory over the San Francisco Giants at Candlestick Park.[3] For the season, he led the Pirates with 100 runs batted in while also clubbing seventeen home runs. He made his only post-season appearances with the 1974 and 1975 Pirates. While batting an impressive .400 in the post-season, Zisk only scored one run and had no RBIs as the Pirates were swept in the 1974 and 1975 National League Championship Series by the Los Angeles Dodgers and Cincinnati Reds, respectively. Following the 1976 season, the Pirates traded Zisk along with Silvio Martinez to the Chicago White Sox for Terry Forster and Rich Gossage.
733	0	a	its fun get it.......if its really cheap or free. Lots of Fun when you can find a match wich is almost never. realisticaly dungeonbowl should be a game option included in the more popular blood bowl games and not a stand alone game on its own. so unfortunately as much as i actualy like this game i cannot continue to recomend it.
734	0	a	When people still played this game, it wasn't bad. It was a fun experience. However, since this is a  MULTIPLAYER ONLY GAME , only in a blue corn moon will you find somebody else to play with. I cannot recommend a dead game, no matter how good or fun it was.  They eventually added sorta-singleplayer, but it's just not the same as the other games in the series. Instead look for Blood Bowl or something else similar. This game just isn't worth your time or money.   DO NOT BUY THIS!
8575	1	a	RaceRoom is an excellent sim racer made by the same people behind Simbin, makers of Race 07 and other great sims. It's worthy of serious consideration by everyone who loves sim racing. Don't be fooled by the many bad reviews, there's a good reason for them, which I'll explain later. There's also more good news later.   https://youtu.be/itBXrA2QEEM   http://youtu.be/I7URfx-CpwE  Raceroom offers a large collection of cars (75 in total) and tracks (25 in total, many of which have several different layouts) and 3 competitions (2 DTM and ADAC) which are called 'Experiences'. These Experiences give you full seasons with teams and drivers. In short, there's a lot of variety in this game.  I haven't put many hours into this game yet, but so far I've found the racing 'experience' to be extremely good. Physics are very realistic and the AI seems pretty good too. One very nice feature is the ARI (Adapative Racing Intelligence) which adjusts the difficulty level automatically to match your skill and experience. At first I wasn't impressed with this since the AI drivers were driving too slowly, but apparently the difficulty level starts low and increases over time. After a few races the AI had adapted to my level and started to provide some decent competition without being overly difficult to beat.  There are three racing modes; Novice, Amateur and Get Real. Novice is a bit of a joke since it actually brakes for you as you approach the corners. Amateur has realistic physics, but with traction control, ABS and zero damage. Get Real turns the driving aids off (but damage is still optional). It's a pity I couldn't configure all these things separately, I'd like to have driven on Amateur level but with damage turned on for example.  Now the bad news...  Many people have criticised this game for being free to play but with very little content. That's true, but what do you expect for free? You get 5 different cars and 3 tracks (each with several variations), more than enough to evaluate the quality of the game and give you some great racing fun for no more than the price of the download.  Think of it this way, the 'free to play' game is just a demo, the REAL game is in the addon packs. Three of the DLCs currently available on Steam are 'Experiences' - full seasons with tracks and cars - DTM 2013 and 2014, ADAC 2014. It actually makes more sense to buy these as DLCs rather than buying a whole new game every year, as with the F1 games. The fourth DLC is just a car pack, not an 'Experience'.  Here's where the problems begin...  The three Experience DLCs contain a lot of duplicate content. They mostly use the same tracks and some of the same cars. For example, the two DTM packs only have 1 track and 1 car different. This makes buying all the DLCs a waste of money, because you're paying for mostly the same content that you've already bought.  To confuse matters even more, there are many more packs you can buy that aren't available as Steam DLCs, as well as individual cars and tracks, some of which are not available in any packs. You can buy them in-game or from their website. These are bought using the in-game currency of vRP points, so you can't see what they cost in real money. However, if you add the items to your cart you can see the cost.  I created a spreadsheet to show what's available in each pack, which you may find helpful;   http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=445609150  Whoever came up with this ridiculous marketing/sales model should be fired. It confuses buyers and can result in wasted money buying duplicate content. Judging by the number of negative reviews, this has backfired on them, which is a pity. I hope they don't go bankrupt again because of this!  Fortunately, there is some good news...  While experimenting with adding various packs to the cart on their website, I discovered that they DON'T CHARGE FOR DUPLICATE CONTENT! They know what cars and tracks you own, so you don't pay extra for what you already have. So if you already own DTM 2013, DTM 2014 will be cheaper as a result. I wanted to buy all the tracks but was loathe to buy the European Track Pack for just one extra track, but when I added it to my cart, it cost less than a pound extra, less than half the price of buying that track individually!  So, it's okay to buy ONE Experience pack from Steam, but if you want any more, buy them from their site instead. Also, don't worry about duplicate content, you won't be charged for it.  Even more good news, the more packs you buy at one time, the cheaper they get. There's a cumulative discount, so if you're going to buy any packs, buy as many as you can afford to save more money. I bought 7 items and got a 16% discount. If you buy all the packs I think you get a discount of around 30%  To give you an idea of cost, I spent less than £30 to get all the tracks and about a third of the cars. I could have gotten all of the tracks cheaper than that, but I wanted some extra cars as well. Two tracks are not contained in any pack. Buying all the packs would cost around £70 I think, but unless you're a collector who has to have everything, it doesn't need to cost that much.  CONCLUSION: I highly recommend this game to all sim racers. Those who prefer casual or arcade racing should probably avoid this game (but by all means try the 'demo' first). The DLCs, packs and points method of selling this game is overly complex and confusing, but if you like this game, don't be put off by that, it's well worth the hassle, and it's much cheaper to buy the extras direct from the game or their website, NOT FROM STEAM!
8577	1	a	Definitely one of the very bests racing simulators available today.  The biggest pros are:   - incredible tracks (highly detailed, with very good lightning effects and filled with alive crowds). - sound which simply is totally amazing - very good, detailed FFB - very good competitive AI - consistent vehicle choice - there are actual real racing series represented (WTCC, ADAC, Hillclimb, Historic DTM), not just some random cars from different classes - good multiplayer, even thou it's still in alpha phase it's highly playable without lots of bugs - very impresive development pace - this game is getting better witch each update, and updates are quite frequent - It is possible to test drive each car before you buy it (you can test it as many times as you wish on one test track). This is great way to really choose only the ones you really enjoy driving, no need to blind buy and regret money you've spent.  cons: some important features, like flags are still missing, but they are on the road list.  The games is incredibly immersive, you can really feer like you've been on the track in raceday for real, all parts of it are very well balanced which gives very consistent quality (not like Assetto Corsa, where you get really stunningly looking cars along with tracks which are mediocre at best, poor sounds and totally useless AI).  For me it is currently definitely number one, I highly recommend it.  As for all those negative comments - just look at the time spent in game by the persons that gives negative comment - it says alot.   Also, please bear in mind that this is simulator - you HAVE TO own decent wheel with good FFB to really enjoy it, otherwise if you use gamepad or even keyboard (!) you will have hard time and lots of frustration trying to control the car. Sorry guys, it's not NFS, you wouldn't try to drive real car with keyboard.
743	0	a	This game could EASILY have become the best sim racing game on steam but is completely ruined by its terrible paywall system that they have. The visuals are very pleasing to the eye and the physics and sound add up to it to make the game feel like a very high end sim. Sadly the microtransaction hell that Sector 3 threw in really ruined the perfect opportunity to make the best simulator for racing fans to enjoy.   Its very depressing because RACE '07 and GTR 2 were both excellent and iconic simulation racing games. Maybe if they had followed the path of their previous games, RaceRoom wouldve been a simulator far better than Assetto Corsa, iRacing, or rFactor2 couldve ever been.  but no matter what i say, this is gonna get downvoted to hell because fanboys cant take having their beloved software being judged, and thats absolutely pathetic.    'Scores'
8579	1	a	This game has its drawbacks, but it is the most rewarding and immersive of all the modern racing titles currently on the market. It has clearly been tainted by early reviewers, because it was launched in such an incomplete state that it´s difficult to comprehend why they did it. As a result of this, combined with a terrible pricing model, the game has received a bad stigma, but one which is entirely undeserved at this point in time.  So, if you have heard bad things about FFB, lack of content, poor framerates or anything else, rest assured that these issues have been fixed, often to the point of excelling in each area. The development team are one of the most forthcoming, open and honest in the business, admitting mistakes where they have been made and explaining any decisions they make.  But we live in a world where racing sims are on the up. So how does it compare?  Where Project CARS lacks complete series, immersive sounds and consistent AI, Raceroom excels in each of these areas.   Where rFactor2 lacks in updated graphic shaders, performance and complete series, Raceroom is more than adequate in each.  Where Assetto Corsa lacks good enough AI for an offline experience, Raceroom blows all competition out of the water.   In summary, this game has fantastic content (albeit with the modular pricing structure - but see below), competitive AI, great netcode, superb physics and THE MOST AMAZING SOUNDS EVER HEARD IN A RACING SIM.   Don`t buy content on Steam - go to their shop where you can bulk-buy VRP, spend an average game`s value and build your own game to your liking.
8581	1	a	Like some people say on other reviews this can be considered just a demo of a overpriced game but for free you get: -some free cars -3 tracks with different settings and time of day -multiplayer -simulator like experience -good sounds -okay graphics  so I can't really complain imo I just wish it wasn't needed to download 17GB to just play the free content....
8583	1	a	DEFINITELY A NEW GAME UNDER MANY ASPECTS After the big patch FFB is now solid, Multiplayer Alpha is lagless with 20+ cars on track, netcode is stunning (no cars take off to the moon if they've been hit by another car), the AI is 'ok' (but still needs improvements), tracks updated with the Road Feel are now so much better to drive onto (because of the way new FFB and updated tracks interact), and the sound... well... WHAT A SOUND!!! TOTAL IMMERSION There are so many good things under the hood about this game that I seriously hope it'll become more appealing and known to all the simracers out there. Despite the unclear, sometime shady and mind-boggling business model S3 has adopted, this game deserve and deserve a lot! Don't be intimidated by the cost of contents in the store. You don't have to buy EVERYTHING (even if the temptation is high!). Set for yourself a budget, buy what you're really interested into and possibly wait for big discounts... they'll surely come. Race on!
8585	1	a	Update: This game keeps better and better. The developer is really making a great effort in making this game better with every patch released. Really cool that there are always new packs.   No idea why the mixed review this game got. After the last update (march 16'), this game has to be one of the best sim racing games out there. FFB is just epic and the sound is really top notch. Have GTX 980 ti 6GB so the graphics are really good when maxed out and with fps ranging from 150-160 fps there is nothing to complain about. Also with a huge muticlass grid (99 cars i think) and bmw M6 GT3 (coming very soon), R3E is a must buy for any simracers out there. GTO and formula junior were just released and bmw m6 gt3 coming soon what else would one ask for. And yeah any car can be test driven before buying. Is there any other game that offers this?   Update:  Here are some videos to help you make up your mind   https://youtu.be/WF2RAj62t5A    https://youtu.be/-IXaAHhIWn8    https://youtu.be/56Jw636XWDk 
744	0	a	RRE is a very good game - the physics and everything seem to be spot on, but I can't recommend it due to how the purchasing system works in combination with other factors which mean you don't get your money's worth. You'll have to spend well in advance of £50 to enjoy most of what this game has to offer and while that in itself is not much of an issue, the fact the server framework seems totally unreliable means you'll be sitting around twiddling your thumbs a lot of the time.   Sometimes the game won't work, sometimes it will. Your friend just down the road from you may be tearing his hair out because he can't get the game started after the latest patch, though it could be you doing the very same the following week while his game miraculously comes back to life. Throw in the Diablo III-style 'always connectedness' (where you simply have to be connected to their servers even for single player games) and what you have is a game that can be thoroughly frustrating.
8587	1	a	I play Racing Sims now for over 25 years and I can say, I had pretty much all of them including the more recent Titles like Assetto Corsa, iRacing, Automobilista etc. When RaceRoom 'R3E' was released 3 years ago it was terrible. I think this was when most of the Sim Racer tried the game and never touched it again. BUT over the last 12 Month the Game became a very solid, very pretty, INCREDIBLY GOOD sounding and very immersive Racing Experience with a nice selection of Tracks and an AMAZING variety of Cars. Sure if you want to own every track and every single car it can be kind of expensive, but look out for Deals (Easter Special 50% off, Black Friday All-in-One 49€ etc) and/or buy the vRP directly on the RaceRoom Store and its a lot cheaper. Also you only need 1 car (~€2,99,-) of a class (GT3 for example) in order to race against the whole field of ATM 13 different GT3 cars. Not like Assetto Corsa where you need every single car pack ! The Online Eperience is still a bit ruff around the edges, but the very small Developer Team works hard, fixes regulary and keeps adding new features. They also keep updating older cars to lift them to the latest physics models which I really appreciate. Every time I play R3E it puts a big smile on my face in a most positive way !
8589	1	a	Just bought R3E last week due to the black friday deal with all content for 49.99€ and must say I'm absolutely blown away by it; it's just a fantastic and truly immersive experience.   This is my first review so felt I had to give my opinion to help balance out some of the redundant criticim and negativity surrounding this game/sim.  Pros:  Sounds (Outstanding!) AI (A lot better than AC or Pcars) Official series Excellent FFB Tracks - although not laser scanned look and feel absolutley spot on. Graphics - Very good, not the best by any means but much better than expected. Great car selection Physics - I'm certainly no expert but has overtaken AC as my new favourite ( Pcars, AC, and Iracing are the only sims I've used)  Cons:  Pricing structure -I only bought this due to the deal making it the same as buying a normal game for £40. I'm really not a fan of the free to play model or Iracing's subsription and single content purchasing.  And what's sad here is I almost denied myself a fantastic sim because of this. If it werent for the deal I'd not have bothered so hopefully the developers can rethink their pricing structure and offer the content for sale altogether like a regular game.   This really exceeded my expectation. It's honestly hard to describe but something just feels right about driving the cars in R3E. A real must have in any sim racing enthusiast's library!  Edit: Looking through some of the negative reviews here and many of them are just rediculous. Yes, the game's certainly not perfect but giving negative reviews for the fact that the game 'needs' a steering wheel when it's designed as a proper simulation is just stupid. Also saying the game is ♥♥♥♥ because you have to buy cars and tracks again is just stupid. Do people actually think free to play games are free?? I certainly don't agree with how the pricing model works but I certainly dont expect to get things (of any real value) for free...
8591	1	a	This isn't an Arcade Racer, this is an Sim race game! +its free +Good Force feedback +very good GFX +you can run it smooth and still good looking even with an lower GFX Card  -Not that much cars/ tracks if you don't spend money but its enough  for a race game fan this is an must have
8593	1	a	Very good racing sim. Playing with a logitech driving force gt and i get a very good force feedback from the car, you can really feal the track and the traction of the car. The physics are really good and the sound is just amazing. You get 3 cars and 1 or 2 tracks in various configurations for free, but the rest of the cars and tracks arent all that costly, even more when you compare it to iracing. I just got the WTCC 2013 pack, with 5 cars and 3 tracks for little more then 10euros and there are a lot of content in discount. A great bonus over other racing games where you need to buy cars is that in Raceroom you can try all the cars before you buy them, they let you get a few laps around a track to see if you like it. If you really like racing games you should try this game out, you will not regret it, besides its free to play, so just try it.
8595	1	a	The game is rock solid. Enjoyable from the very first race until now. Don't hesitate and try it
746	0	a	The graphics are great, the physics feel authentic and there's no question that a lot of work went into making this a high-quality racing sim. The business model is sketchy (at best) and resembles EA over the last few years--- free games are probably around to stay, but excessive microtransactions don't have to come with them. I'd gladly pay $20 for unlimited access to all of the content in the game--- or $40 if it included community-creation tools. Just my two cents: proceed with extreme caution.
8597	1	a	This really is a top racing sim and its a shame it doesnt get the publicity it deserves. I think its problem is it gets lost in a sea of racing titles but this really is up there with the best. As of January 2015 it sets a benchmark in sim racing for sounds and probably AI as well, the physics are also superb.   You can download the base content for free which again is fantastic and there are add-ons which are sometimes on sale. Another great feature is leaderboard challenges where they give away prizes for the fastest times. A great addition to this is a lot of the time you dont need to have purchased the content to take part so you can try these before you buy.  Where this game is let down is by a few minor bugs but mainly its so unpopulated online its really a shame and can be tough to get decent races but i think that comes down to the lack of publicity it has had.   I cant recommend this strongly enough and as the base content is free its well worth trying it out
8599	1	a	This title was off to a rocky start but with consistant updates and ehancements has gone from mediocre to most probably the best Sim out there.   Though this sim is listed as a Free 2 Play title and comes with several cars and a few track for nothing - you will need to spend a little cash in order to get the cars and tracks you want. The pricing on these addons is quite minimal and you only need to buy what you actually want and when you want it. Oh and you can test drive every car as many times as you like before deciding if you want to buy it.  Here's the rundown:  Graphics 8/10 - they are by no means bad - in fact the sim looks very natural and life like  Sound 10/10 - You can't get any more real than this without getting in the actual cars. Every detail from transmission whine and chassis squeaks to wind, transmission flex, gravel and reverb etc.. have been taken into account. The sound alone give this sim more immersion than the competition.   Physics 9/10 This score was a few points lower a couple months back, but with recent and ongoing enhancements to several group cars and more being fixed currently, R3e is more than deserving of this rating. If they get all the cars to the level they are achieving with the ones they already edited - I see a glorious 10 out of 10 coming in the near future.  FFB 10/10 - for me it was GSCE that held the title for FFB with AC and RF2 following slighly behind, but R3e has taken that title by leaps and bounds. I know this sounds exagerated, but you have to feel it to believe it - and I've never felt this good behind the wheel in my 15+ years of racecraft.  Car Content Variety 8/10 There are tons of cars available - though the list is still a bit on the short side. This is not to say that I don't have enough cars. The fact is I own more than I've had time to drive, but still wish there were a few Group C cars in the mix as those are my absolute favorites. Did I mention that you can test drive every car without buying.  Car Quality 10/10 - This title is on par with AC when it comes to detail. The exterior/interior along with suspension and tires are all done with upmost attention to even the small details.  Track Content Variety 8/10 Again the amount of tracks are quite limited compared to other titles, but not lacking. Several of my favorite tracks are included (Bathurst, Spa, Nurburgring, RedBull Ring, Suzuka, Nords, etc..) They have also included a lazer scanned Nordschleife into the mix with more lazer scanned tracks to come.  Track Quality 10/10 Right up there with AC and iRacing when it comes to track surface and detail. The sky boxes are absolutely believable and the environmental details are more than real enough to enjoy.   Multiplayer 8/10 Much better racing experience than most sims I've played, but it still has it's issues. The netcode has been updated recently and seems to be working great, but I have not had enough time with it to give it a better score.  Singleplayer 10/10 The AI have been improved greatly and their difficulty can be set to adaptive which takes some patience for them to settle in, but when they do they are a joy to race with. Also the 'Experiences' make this title a dream when it comes to playing championships.  Community 10/10 This is probably the least toxic sim community out there. Most everyone is friendly and helpful. The devs are also very active within the forums and listen to the players.  I'm not sure what all I left out, but I'll be sure to update this in the future.  Also: I know this review appears to be written by a fanboy due to the high scores given. I assure you this is not the case. I play many Sims more than I have this. Infact there was a long time which I felt this title was a waste of drive space, but as stated above - it has come a long way.  Whether you're a veteran to racecraft or are a complete newbie, give RaceRoom a try. You have nothing to lose since it can be played for free.
8601	1	a	I wanted to try it because it's free to play and I use a wheel (T300RS). It was a huge surprise. Even if the menu are ♥♥♥♥♥♥, the physics, the graphics and especially the sound are absolutely amazing! The development is active and this is amazing! I have a lot more good time with RRRE than I expected! The big con however is the content princing ... but the content quality is really the highest I found as game DLC.  As comparison I play Assetto Corsa, Dirt Rally (and sometimes Project Cars...).
8603	1	a	This game was updated recently and now you can race against AI or in multiplayer races. Also, the new force feedback feels very good. I really like the new ADAC GT as well. There is still room for improvement, but I think it's worth a few bucks to check out the new content!
8605	1	a	If you have a FFB-wheel, do yourself a favor and try this game!  - The tyre physics are based on the ISI Motor engine powering rFactor and make for fantastic car feel.  - The sound is momentarily the BEST(!) in any(!) racing sim out there.  If the  pricing model is putting you off , try the free content for a few minutes. If you like that,  wait for sales . Last black friday you could buy all content for the price of a normal racing game, as if the freemium model wouldn't exist.
8607	1	a	Very nice racing sim. Unlike the other racing games for PC this one works properly and doesnt feel Beta.
8609	1	a	paid same price as any other game $50 worth of RP, unlocked all content when on sale. i advised all my gaming friends to hold off till discounts then buy all the content. the game gets discounted about 3 times a year.  its pretty much the best simbin game while we wait for gtr3 best graphics &amp; best sounds so far. best bathurst track -better than mod assetto is catching up with the graphics but not the sound yet.  looking forward to when its finished cant wait to play multiplayer with friends online with this one still playing GTR2 &amp; GTL multiplayer while i wait.  if your a simbin fan, this is a great game -way better physics than race 07, pretty much as good as gtr2 the game should be marked as EARLY ACCESS as its an ALPHA with full costing implemented  they do give u 5 good free cars but if your unsure about this game then buy the minimum RP and unlock your favourite track (mine are bathurst or mid ohio) and do some laps in each car and you will decide if you like it or not. i couldnt recommend the free track they give you, its pretty crap to test the game on. the free hill climb is better.  dont buy the game unless your a sim freak and have atleast a logitech g25/g27 or better -its not an arcade game and expect to spend an hour getting you controls right so you get the most out of it. then you will be rewarded.  hurry up simbin, finish this game!!!    
8611	1	a	Purchased the game after just a few laps into the Free-to-play as I was hooked. The SOUND in this game is inspiring and almost as destructuve as being near a true performance vehicle. I play on an SLI EVGA 780 system and get wonderful SLI performance of 95% per GPU usage and the FPS never dips below an enjoyable level on surround (3 monitors). The tracks are layed out similar to other racing games but in comparason to GT5 or GT6, Grid Autosport and the like you get a feel of taking a corner and fluffing the apex, braking too late or just destroying your engine with a lap in 1st gear if you enjoy playing realistic. Did I mention the SOUND! Graphical quality is top notice so learn the keyboard setting to adjust your seat height, distance from the wheel etc to suit your driving style. The AI is hard when you start and since I am still only 10 p[us hours into practicing, they just zoom passed me like I am stuck with the handbrake on. Did I mention the SOUND! If you can use a stereo sound system with a subwoofer you will be in Race Room heaven. Keep up the great work on devloping this game further and keep the large playing base glued to this game. BEST game I had never heard about.
8613	1	a	Gameplay is awsome. Sounds are awsome. I dont recommend you play this with a keyboard tho. You can join competisions and championships online that update all the time. They have a replay system built in thats super easy to use and actually works really well. The game is free but only comes with 3 race tracks and a couple of cars, but buying other cars and race tracks are cheap and isnt really the issue with this game like everyone says it is. To be honest there are no issues with this game so if you feel like geting into sim racing but dont feel like buying assetto corsa or anyother game, then I strongly recommend downloading this, and also, Ignore the hate. All hate for this game is because people are to cheap to spend a couple of bucks for other tracks and cars.
8615	1	a	In short: RaceRoom Racing experience is a great racing simulator to those looking for cut-throat competitive AI in offline racing. The multiplayer is shaping up to be great, but in its current Alpha state it's not quite there yet. If you're on the fence, try the free content first and if you're looking to spend a few bucks, consider either DTM '92, ADAC GT Masters 2013 or 14, or the WTCC '13 pack. Money well spent. Look below the review for a comprehensive list of Pro's and Con's after the verdict.   Visually  R3E is a competitive title, on par with Assetto Corsa. Track textures and detail are what you expect them to be in a 2014 racing sim. Everything looks quite sharp and well detailed. Car interiors are nicely modelled as well, leaving only very few wishes to be desired. A few upcoming titles might look a bit better, but we'll see to those as they get released.  Ligthing, color and saturation in R3E seem very life-like and real. Lighting conditions can be selected from one of 5 presets: Sunrise, Morning, Noon, Evening and Sunset, with full real-time transitions coming later down the road.  In the  Sound  department, R3E really starts to shine. Or roar. Compared to other simulation titles like Assetto Corsa, Game Stock Car Extreme and rFactor2, the cars and engines in R3E sound like they have the punch they claim to have. The sound has just the right amount of reverb to immerse you and make you think you are sitting in fact inside of the car you are pretending to be driving at your PC.  On the  driving  side of thins, there is a lot of good to report as well: The physics feel similiar to other hardcore racing sims like rF2 or GSCE. It becomes immediately apparent whenever you push the car too hard, resulting in oversteer and overshooting a corner or massive oversteer and spinning out - or if you are lucky - just a major slide of the ideal racing line.  The game does communicate what is going on under your car really well through the  Force Feedback . With a little practice you can judge pretty well just by feel if you are about to lose the rear of the car, or whether your rear tyres have just locked up. This is really important in a racing sim, and in this regard R3E is comparable to Assetto Corsa and Game StockCar Extreme, but still a little off from rFactor2. To be fair, the FFB in rF2 is unmatched by any other sim.  If you're not up for racing against other people over the internet, R3E's AI will give you a good challenge. They can be either set to a fixed difficulty level (from 80 to 120%) or alternatively to Adaptive AI, which will ramp up or soften the difficulty depending on how well you do against the AI. In general, Adaptive AI is pretty good at giving you just the right challenge. You have to work really hard for a Victory, but at the same time the AI don't leave you in the dust and you always have some other cars to race against. In their general behaviour the AI race hard against you, but fair. They don't bump you out of the way, but they will use gaps to overtake. They will defend their position with defensive lines and not just stick to a single racing line. (I'm looking at you there, Gran Turismo.) In comparision to Assetto Corsa, the AI in R3E is more aggressive, but still fair.  Unfortunately the game is missing an AI agression control, like rFactor2 and Game StockCar Extreme have. I'd like to tweak the AI not just in skill, but also in agression.  Now, some time for  Multiplayer!  There are no dedicated servers available yet, so you have to hope that your favorite track/car combination is currently running on a server hosted by Sector3 studios. The servers are 'jump in and drive', meaning that if you don't pay attention you might end on a server that has just finished Qualifying and you start a race from the back of the grid. Netcode in Multiplayer is really solid. No cars warping around, no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t contacts and bumps between cars that are 2 meters apart on screen. The community is okay, you get the occasional idiot who wrecks half the field and other people rage quit whenever they lose too many positions for their tastes, but additional features like ranking systems and wrecker bans are on the horizon for the Multiplayer, as well as Dedicated Servers for everyone.  Now for the most controversial part about this simulator:  The Store &amp; The Pricing : Out of the box you have access to two circuit tracks, a hillclimb track and a bunch of cars from different classes. In my opinion that's decent content for a free portion of a game. Some people might disagree, but everyone is entitled to their opinion I guess.  Tracks and Cars can be bought with  Virtual Race Points  or  vRP , and after the latest update with hard earned cash directly. This alleviates my previous criticism about having to essentially give Sector3 free money in exchange for virtual currency. Prices are not that cheap, but they are reasonable. A new car or track will generally set you back 2€ to 4€. You can get bigger discounts if you buy more stuff in bulk, or if you get stuff in packs: The DTM '92 pack with it's 5 cars and a ton of liveries is ~10€ compared to ~18€ when you buy them all individually. Additional discounts are granted to everyone who owns cars and tracks of a new pack: For example, I get a huge discount on ADAC GT Masters 2014 pack, because I already own most of the tracks and cars in R3E already. I think that's a fair system.  There is an option to  Test Drive  all the cars on the RaceRoom Raceway that is included in the game. You can also take part in the free competitions that are changing regularly. Those competitions feature a rotating set of cars and tracks. You don't have to own them to drive them, and if you're fast you might even win a prize!  Recommendations for your first purchase(s):  * DTM '92 pack (5 cars with a lot of liveries) * DTM Experience 2013 (3 cars, ton of liveries, 9 tracks) * WTCC 2013 pack (5 cars, ton of liveries, 3 tracks) * ADAC GT Masters 2013 (7 cars, ton of liveries, 6 tracks)   Verdict : If you have tried this sim half a year ago, please do come back and try it again! The driving physics and Force Feedback have been vastly improved, along with the new and fairer store pricing &amp; discount system. R3E drives just as well as Assetto Corsa, rFactor2 and Game StockCar Extreme. It has the best single player AI on the market, apart from GSCE and the largest selection of content (sans Modding) of the currently availlable sims.   Pro's  * Good Graphics * Great sounds * Very competitive AI * Good driving physics and FFB   Con's  * Multiplayer a bit bare-bones at the moment * Game can get expensive if you want to have everything
8617	1	a	With the new update this game transformed into something very beautiful. The new Adac gt masters cars and tracks have very nice physics and roadfeel. totally worth it.
8619	1	a	I have played a number of racing sims, in fact most of them, this is one of the best. The sound is the best is any sim out there the Force Feedback on my Fanatec wheel is amazing and the graphics are great. In fact this game isnt even that graphics hungry on my GTX 1080 yet it looks fantastic. The AI is brutal when running in hardest setting and no assists, which is the only way to play this game. I think it is one of the best sims on the market. If I had one complaint it is that the Brands Hatch track is the short cart track not the full track. I am sure that Sector 3 can fix that. I woulds also love if they would put the Aussie V8 supercars in.
8621	1	a	'oh i don't like spending money blah blah' ♥♥♥♥ this game is very high quality with great driving physics and suberb sound quality. Absolutely worth $60 and beyond.
8623	1	a	great sim game. best played with a wheel. ok with a controller. graphics and sounds are very good. don't expect much from the free content. you can try any car on their fantasy track for free. and you can try different tracks in their free competitions(there's usually 6-8). you do have to pay to get the most out of this game. if you buy one car and one track at a time, it can be very expensive, but if you buy vrp from their  store(https://www.raceroomstore.com/shop_en/list_page?cat=24)  and then buy some car packs and track packs, that will save you a lot of money. look for multiplayer games on evenings and weekends UK time, otherwise it's pretty dead.
8625	1	a	If you jump into the game just play a race and quit it u'll hate it. This game free version is limited to few tracks, few cars and has really difficult gameplay since It's really realistic. Pros: Car sounds are just absolutely amazing, physix are so real, the game is really hard if you remove all helpers but once you get used to the driving you'll love it.  Graphics are really good for a free game and you don't have to max them out to see good result. There is the challenges, you get to try cars on a selected track and you can win prizes if you set a good time which is really competitive. The game is not made for controller or keyboard, it is pure for a wheel if you want to get 100% accuracy while driving Didn't try the dtm experience yet but looking forward to. One amazing thing, is that the game is constanty updating and there is now the multiplayer which is alpha but looking good.
8627	1	a	Well, this is a pretty good game if you have some money to invest in. Great physics, great graphics, the only problem is that the cars as tracks are very expensive... But if you have the money...
8629	1	a	Great free game. Lots of bad reviews by people that have played it for 20 minutes. This is a simulator and takes time to get the hang of. A lot of people are reviewing it as an arcade racing game. It isn't! It's a good place to start if you're used to racing games as it's free and there's nothing to lose if you dont like it.
8631	1	a	At the moment, racesim fans like me seems to live in a golden Age of Racing-Sims as there are a a few promising Sims are out on the market. To put a name to these Sims we've got Project CARS, Assetto Corsa and this game here - RaceRoom Racing Experience (short name R3E). As I was a member of the WMD-Kickstarter-Project for Project CARS I have played it a lot and followed the development-Progress from nearly beginning since its release. I was always impressed by its visual presentation and the dynamic Wether and time-progress...  Then there was Assetto Corsa... they started to release an early access-Version and I can't hold to get into it... In the beginning i was a bit disappointed because of the strange behavior of the Force-Feedback. After I tweaked it a bit I had some Fun with it but I don't become the feeling that I always want to play it. And now coming to RaceRoom Racing Experience... I started playing R3E in the beginning of the open beta-Phase. It was fun in the beginning but only good for hotlapping as other features were in development. After a while Sector 3 opens more and more features and deliver more and more content. So we've got Famous racing Series like ADAC GT-Masters, WTCC, the modern DTM and even the most famous classic DTM from the Year 1992. And that's the point where I got hooked in the Game. Despite the other Games, in R3E i've got the feeling to compete in a Racing-Series known in real live. In the other games the Races feel like a loose mixture of cars out of the game... Together with that R3E offers me the best Force-Feedback and the best Roadfeel of all... Not to forget - the Sound of the Racecars. There isn't any other Racesim out on the market the comes even close to the Sound in R3E. Multiplayer-Races are very great fun with close door to door fights. In the visual aspect - yes it is not that high polished like Project CARS and it has no dynamic weather at the moment, but it is very detailed. Especially the Tracks are very close to the real thing and modeled with a high affinity. There are no unnecessary Trackside-Objects that aren't there at the real track what gave me a more realistic feeling. One of the most important parts of a racesim is the Physics-Model... At that Point R3E at the same level as Assetto Corsa. Together with the better Roadfeel in R3E this game is the winner for me. Project CARS falls back in that point - fun to drive in Project CARS but not more... One negative aspect of R3E is the Business-Model of it. It is called Free-to-Play, what it really is, but only with reduced Content. In F2P you have 5 Free cars and 3 Tracks with 11 Layouts. With this content you can do what ever you want - Multiplayer-Races. Single-Player-Championships, Hotlapping and so on. Together with that, there are always a few Competitions online, in which you are able to drive with Cars and on Tracks you haven't bought before.  If you want to buy something, it can get expensive. But there are a few Tricks to get it in an acceptable range. So you can buy a Redeem-Code for the ingame-currency 'vRP' directly from Raceroom which offer a discount from 10% to 35%. Than you can buy Packs in the store which contains content-objects for a discounted price. The Track-Packs are perfect for that. But you don't have to buy a Car-Pack if you just like one car out of it. Than you can buy that single car and that allows you to drive in Competition or Multiplayer-Races in that Class and other things like that. If you are not sure what to buy, you can always ask at the Sector3-Forum. You will definitely get an answer out of the community - or even from one of the developers. That's another great plus for me, that the Developers are in close contact to the Community and take part in discussions in the Forum.  In Conclusion I just can say, that R3E maybe isn't the best in every aspect (graphics, busness-model), but overall for me it is the best RacingSim out on the market which hooked me and entertained me a long time now. As it is still in development it will even get better. 
8633	1	a	Dont listen to people who only play an hour or 2 then post a negative comment because they have to pay for additional cars! those reviews are based on cost, but this game like the other sims on the market has a cost, yes its free to play but to get the best out of the game you need to purchase additional cars and tracks and pay just like you do for assetto corsa, project cars etc! This review is about the game and not the price, also dont listen to those who moan cos it crashed as its probably their pc full of spyware or viruses, never had a problem with this game at all !   I own automobilista, iracing, assetto corsa, project cars, rfactor 2, stock car extreme and race07. Each has their good points and bad points but fort me the best 2 are automobilista and raceroom. Why? because they have plenty of options, championship mode, multiplayer, leaderboard challenges and lots of cars and circuits. I also feel that these 2 are most realistic to driving a real car , sometimes in the other games theres always a lot of oversteer and sliding around. However for me automobilista and raceroom are the best at time of writing this review! it's realisitic, has championship modes, multiplayer modes, loads of circuits loads of cars! Its free to play, yes, but to get the best out of it best to purchase the other cars and tracks.
8635	1	a	Geht ab :D  EDIT 2015: Great progress in the past 2 years, nice content, great ffb, physics and still evolving.  You can testdrive every car and there is alot more free content then in 2013. Give it a try..!  Great league racing also already possible. Take a look here at a video from the german virtual racing touring cars league at Nürburgring:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcQfC5IdVjs 
8637	1	a	BETA Review.    UPDATE6/17/15------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Well, the game keeps getting better, and better. It certainly has taken some time to get here, but the game and its content very, very good. The recent patch has made a number of much needed updates and optimizations. The dedicated servers has seen the online community grow, Tracks like Shanghai and Macau and cars like WTCC 2014 have really set this sim apart.  I have no idea how this game has such a low comunity score....well I do, its the F2P model...which really isn't F2P....I would really give it a go, the cars and tracks are some of the best done of all the big sims out there, iRacing, Pcars, AC, imo.  UPDATE 11/01/14---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- So I bought a wheel G27, and am really enjoying the game. Much better with a wheel, although a controller was decent and has some advantages, but it is really not the way to go with a sim.  The updates that have been done have massively improved the game: Time of day, updated Force Feedback, track and car physics improved(check to see if which cars and tracks are updated). It still has a way to go, but is so much better.   The WTCC cars are a blast. The ADAC GT cars are big heavy beasts. DTM is somewhere in the middle. Once the game gets a championship(pit stops and tires) and MP gets out of Alpha there will be a very, very solid game here.  I would definitely check it out...it is starting to take up a chunk of my life! ------------------------------ I am new to 'sim' racing games. Always loved a good race game in my youth (a while ago now), Super Monaco GP, Daytona, Ridge Racer etc... I bought Ridge Racer Unbounded for a couple of bucks and forgot how much I enjoyed racing games. The drifting was so absurd, but it was fun. I started looking at other types of racing games and saw this one and it was Free to play. UGHH. No harm no foul trying a F2P game. It doesn't cost anything. I figured I would download the game, play it for a week and then be done with it…   Well fast forward a couple of weeks; I am having a great time. Using an Xbox controller, this took a long time to calibrate correctly. It was quite a challenge at first, I like difficult games. I really want to upgrade to a wheel... but patience! I don't really understand most people’s complaints with the game, it seems most people/reviews say the game would be really good if this or that was fixed. A majority were very minor complaints but together resulted in poor reviews. The core of the game is strong, but there are issues with the game. I can forgive them at this point since it is still in Beta and I haven't spent a penny on it. The game has potential to be a LOT of fun as areas are improved and features added, but it will be interesting to see if the studio can get this title to that point - With the restructuring of the studio, hopefully they continue to improve the game at an acceptable pace! :)  Oddly this was one time where the F2P model worked in my favor. I can see someone who wants all the goods to be annoyed with this model, but with common sense and waiting for sales you can probably pay for the tracks and cars you want and get out of it with little spent. If you want it all or a lot, the model fails. You would think they would offer tracks and cars in packages for a reasonable savings. Maybe they will change the F2P model a bit to allow for both ways to owning the complete game? I am just waiting for the DTM Experience to go on sale and I will definitely buy it!!!
8639	1	a	This game has been receiving loads of updates recently and the more i play it the more i want to. Plenty tracks and cars to choose from to get you going for free.   The game is very brutal to you for your mistakes. Using Apex Hunt for practise will get you understanding the car and track. Hitting corners within cars capability feels sweet with regard to how you have car balanced in relation to amount of speed, braking or acceleration; depending on the line you take. You have to set the car up for each corner to hit that sweet spot of being in control or not.  Brake too hard for a corner and you will lock up and drift wide until you regain grip, brake to late and carry to much speed into corner you are greatly penalised for your misjudgement.   There are loads of Challenges, Competitions and other race modes.  Still finding new features each time I take time to navigate through all the in game options one of which that caught my eye was the ability to capture video and take screenshots from the automatically saved replays from your best lap time for each car and track combination.  7.5/10   Edit 24/11/2016  This games's physics, look and feel with evreything else about this game has just hugely changed for the better. Brilliant racing simulator. Most defintely worh checking out if you like motorsport.  Like a fine wine this game just improves with age.  9/10
8641	1	a	I'm fairly new to PC Simulation gaming, the main reason I bought my rig was for Race Sims and so far my time has been spent mostly on RaceRoom Racing Experience. I can't quite put my finger on why.   the game feels much, much smoother than the other two i've played (Assetto Corsa and Automobilista), i'm yet to give others a go. Along with having a superior sense of speed, I believe the cars handle much closer to their real life counterparts, mainly because i've been behind the wheel of an open wheeler and it bought back a few key memories and feelings.   Annoyingly, the game is a money pit, but hey, the base game is free and i'd be more than happy to invest on just the GT series and WTCC series, but... That's not me, I need them all!!! I've had a blast in the masters and WTCC series so far. I'm really, really hoping they can pick up a WEC license at some point, then this game will literally be my go to.   The tracks seem pretty solid, Brands Hatch feels really solid, incredibly close to the real version, this is the only track I know from person so the only one I can really push. Other tracks also feel solid, Force Feedback seems to be creditable with a nice road feel and tyre lean coming through the wheel nicely.   RaceRoom seems to be the only game to give me a close race all the way through the race, others seem to have the ai drop off a little at stages. My one annoyance with RaceRoom is that I seem to blast the Qualifying 1 or 2 seconds faster than second place but then the ai stick with me through the race, even though my lap times barely drop off from qualifying. Not that i'm complaining, I love bumper to bumper action that the WTCC delivers.   But from my amature opinion, I'd chose RaceRoom over Assetto Corsa and Automobilista, but only for now, Assetto Corsa seems to be going places fast, especially now there's a console version to push the developers a bit. Automobilista is a fantastic sim too, so ♥♥♥♥ing fun, i've never even heard of the developers but they've done a banging job! As soon as they get their hands on a new graphics engine, things are going to go pretty sweetly for them. I believe they got there's engine from the first version of a very popular racing sim with an insane tyre model. They're sticking with it because they know the engine so well which is fair enough, it does need updating though XD   But yeah... Add WEC with multi category racing and i'll fall in love with RaceRoom.
8643	1	a	Great progress on last update, defeneatly worth checking out. Keep up the good work!
8645	1	a	Great game, almost up there with titles like Asseto Corsa, rFactor2 and iRacing in terms of realistic driving.  One of the most immersing sounds in this genre, and nice looking graphics.  It's F2P but the price of the content seems a bit higher than it should be.  8/10
8647	1	a	Ok this game had a bad start, but as it stands today it is a worthy followup to the famous Race '07 series.  Keep up the good work!
752	0	a	Enjoyed what i played BUT!  It says free to play but its more like a demo You get a few cars and only 2 tracks (like WTF you have to buy tracks) All the DLC = 118 pounds You can get 3 Triple A Titles for this price  I Thought World of Tanks was Brutal on the premium but this is pure Bill Gates ♥♥♥♥ right here 
8649	1	a	It is a decent game, fps is great and i think that once you get the hang of it; it will start to become addicting. Everything from the cars to the stands look great. Even the exhaust from the cars sound amazing. Good luck c:
8651	1	a	Superb racing sim, I really don't understand the negative reviews, are people expecting a non-realistic arcade racer? Excellent graphics, sound, physics and AI. Playable even with just a gamepad (though you really need at least this, not mouse and keyboard), with the correct settings - visit the Sector 3 forum for help wth controller profiles. Also realtively cheap, if you just focus on a particular class - the ADAC GT Masters pack is good value, comes with all the cars and tracks you need for a championship.
8653	1	a	got to play this game it's awesome
8655	1	a	R3E is really a terrific racing sim! It was perhaps launched too early with many features lacking or functioning badly, but recently, though still in beta, it has really delivered in my opinion.  I also have the 'other two' contemporary racing games, AC and pC and I must say that I find R3E most fun of these three. For example, I think BMW M1 Procar is even more fun to drive in R3E than it is in pC which I find a blast in pC also. R3E is not perfect, at least yet, but it surely has its strengths. Sounds are just awesome and with the recent 9GB 'patch' they got even better. FFB is also best of the three games and it deliveres the road feel really well and doesn't even require hours of tinkering with settings to get it right. AI is also the most competent of the three by a big margin, so R3E is perhaps the best choice for the single players at least until AC and pC improve their AI algorithms. Graphics are also quite good, although not on par with pCars, but on the other hand, R3E runs also very well on my three monitor setup.  But hey, physics are the most important thing, no? Here R3E fares also well. Physics aren't perhaps the most accurate on the planet, but still very believable and with awesome FFB I like the driving feel a lot. I say it again, I think R3E delivers the most fun experience of the three. Still, R3E is by no means arcade racer and leans heavily towards simming side of the genre.  As said and at the time of writing, R3E is still in beta and a work in progress. It is still quite polished and offers pretty much full experience already. It has no weather or full night, but it is otherwise pretty much a full deal IMO. Things I dislike the most are annoying load times, which surely improved with the latest patch, but are still on the annoying side especially on the menus. Micropayment system is completely a matter of opionion and it really doesn't bother me. You can have just one experience set and that gives you several tracks and a class of cars and that's basically all you need. If you wan't more, different packs give good value for money and you get discounts for the packs of the items you already may own.  If you like sim-like racing games don't hesitate to try the R3E. You can do it for free, but of course with very limited options for driving.
8657	1	a	8/10 Great race sim plagued by a terrible payment and content structure. I'm giving this a thumbs up only because it's actually a great racing sim experience with excellent single player AI and vehicle physics. Unfortunately you need to always be online to play.   Multiplayer is still hit or miss and sometimes you will get randomly disconnected.   I sincerely hope SInBin/Sector3 change this game to a flat pricing fee if they truely want to entice more players to the game. The game content is always on sale at least 50% on their website (cheaper than steam prices) so I wouldn't worry about missing out on sales. I've never seen any of the packs at full price. For example the regular price for the DTM 2014 pack is 8318 vRP or about $85 US without a discount on their site! Who would pay that much!? The permanent discount price is there to get you to buy stuff and is a classic marketing trick!  If you're looking to get into Raceroom Experience with minimal cost I recommend the DTM 2013 pack and the American track pack. It only costs about $20 USD and gets you a great race series along with 13 tracks...  Circuit Park Zandvoort Red Bull Ring Spielberg EuroSpeedway Lausitz Moscow Raceway Hockenheimring Nürburgring Norisring Motorsport Arena Oschersleben Brands Hatch Mazda Laguna Seca Mid Ohio Indianapolis Sonoma Raceway  After that things ramp up in price very quickly! It'll cost you $102 USD for all tracks, three different race series and a big variety of vehicles (but not all of them). Detailed below. Keep in mind this still isn't all of the content available, probably around 75% of it!  WTCC 2013 DTM Experience 2013 ADAC GT Masters Experience 2014 DTM 1992 GTR2 Pack Group 5 Pack American Track Pack Track: Circuit Zolder Track: Bathurst Circuit Track: Salzburgring * All remaining tracks included in above packs  $102.59 USD Order Total (after discounts)  If you want every vehicle in the game expect to pay well over $150 USD for all content.   My advice is to just buy the $20 package I listed above and be happy with that. It's the 'best deal/bang for the buck' and still gets you a lot of racing action and tracks for that price. 
8659	1	a	  My specs:    Medion Notebook with GTX 670MX and i7 3630QM (Win7 Pro) + 28' Monitor (playing in fullHD) Logitech G920 + shifter    Why I recommend the game:    For anyone, who is into simracing, with r3e you probably get one of the best, if not THE best racing simulator on the market. I can compare to Assetto Corsa, rFactor 2 (Demo), Stock Car Extreme, Project Cars, Grid Autosport, NFS Shift and NFS Shift 2.  Different to f.ex. Assetto Corsa, in r3e you can only drive real racing cars, no stock versions of them. There are not only features like tyre rubbing or fuel consumption, enthusiasts have many options to mechanically set up the car the way they want.  Physics and force feedback feel great on the G920. It doesn't take long to get a feeling for the car you drive. Never the less it can be preety hard to get controll back after oversteering with some cars. Also you can set up the ffb settings by yourself, if the default ones doesen't suit you.  In singleplayer the AI difficulty can be set up in small steps, just like in Asseto Corsa. There also is an adaptive mode.  As far as my experiences go with multiplayer, I have a pretty good impression of the community. Didn't met a 'NFS crash kiddy' yet (EDIT: you actually meet some, especially in races with free content). There are not only extremely quick hardcore racers on the way, r3e is also played by some real life racers, even from DTM.  Graphics are state of the art and performance is very good. Only things I miss, are 'bad' weather effects like rain and wet tracks for more slippery action sometimes.    Things you should know/some people may not like:    R3e may be called 'freetoplay'. I would describe it more like a bigger demo version of a game, which allows to configure its content the way the customer wants it. So f.ex. if you don't want to drive formula cars, you don't need to buy them. There is the option to do as many test drives as you like of every car, which is very fair in my opinion. You also can drive in hotlap competitions with cars and tracks you don't own.  You can purchase every car or track seperately or buy packs (what can be cheaper). I recommend to buy VRP on the r3e store website. As far as I know, this should be the cheapest way to buy content.  One thing that is pretty annoying, is the fact, that if you bought a car in the f.ex. GT Masters 2014 Version, you still need to buy the same car again (at least cheaper) in the GT3 or GT Masters 2015 Version.  To sum it up: if you really want to play the game with as much content as similiar games offer, r3e is a bit expensive but the price is still OK if you buy packs or take offerings on sale.    Conclusion:    If you are looking for a racing simulation game and you have a ffb wheel, at least test the game in freetoplay-mode. If you are an 'arcade racer' and don't want to put much effort into playing and paying, this probably isn't the game for you. Never the less you still have the option to give it a try for free :)
8661	1	a	absolutely amazing! after the new update (sept. 10 ) its just perfect ,great cars ,great tracks mp is flawless even though its in alpha  ai is competetive and a lot of fun dont worry about the pricing model either its changing for the better and its also free to try, so dont listen to anyone, not even me, download it, try it and you will love it
753	0	a	It's a good game. But WAY too expensive.   To buy all the tracks alone it would cost over £80. The game is basically a demo for a HIGHLY overpriced game.   All in, it's unfortunate that this is the economic model we are given. If there was a free to play element with perhaps a War Thunder style tech tree or something (Not sure how it would work but still) it would be possibly the pinnacle of racing games on steam.   Unfortunately what the end user is presented with is a game that would cost in excess of £150 to fully unlock with no option to earn any of the unlocks by actually playing the game.   It's a massive shame. I wish it wasn't like this. It was fun to play.
754	0	a	RaceRoom Experience could've been a top tier Racing Simulator, but decided to be a 'server only' renting platform.  I can not stay supportive when I'm constantly having connectivity issues and gameplay breaking bugs. Not to mention, it cost me $300 for all the content, which makes it the most expensive, unreliable game I own (rent)  In short, you need to be connected to their servers at all times or you simply cannot play the game, and when you are connected you are constantly experiencing lag, '503' server errors, etc......  So when other great titles can be enjoyed in offline mode without issues, I cannot recommend investing in RaceRoom Experience at the moment, or at least until an 'offline mode' is offered. Which is disappointing as R3E has ADAC, WTCC and DTM racing with great sound which initially attracted me to this game.
8663	1	a	Im not usually drawn to do reviews, but i'll take the time out to persuade you that this is a quality product. Of the two offererings about of late, Project Cars &amp; RRRE, I would hands down take RRRE. What it lacks (only slightly though) in looks it more than makes up for in AI, SOUNDS (!!!!!!) and game mechanics and handling.   The devs also listen to the community and are patching and or updating/adding all the time with changes to UI, changes to daytime/evening time racing, dedicated servers, create-a-championship (for offline players). New cars and tracks being added all the time, and to a VERY high level. A few of my friends have tried both PCARS and RRRE and have also concluded of the two its the stronger product.   I will say, whether its an issue with AMD or not the game does seem to run slower than PCARS. But with a few changes in the graphics menu you can get the game running smooth and fast.   I would def recommend this to ANY budding racers out there. The G5 cars are the shiz.  POWERFUL RRRE!!!
8665	1	a	New update makes this sim outstanding. Excellent physics, excellent graphics, fantastic AI = you really NEED this game.. I LOVE SIMBIN (Sector3). Dont think about it, get it!
8667	1	a	Looks like a worthy successor to RACE 07 series. Still needs a bit of polish especially in the multiplayer department, but is a lot of fun as it is right now. After a few tweaks the physics/FFB system feels quite natural. The devs keep working on improving the game and it's visible. Competitions are one of my favourite modes. They are a great way to improve multiplayer experience, as it's a nice incentive for drivers to improve track knowledge and setups by competing with others.
8669	1	a	I've never written a review on steam before. I have 2 kids and I hardly have time to wipe my ♥♥♥ because I have to wipe theirs. I also have a stressful full time job. Because of that, and because my favorite games are racing games, I went on the hunt for a great racing game to use as therapy.  Assetto Corsa: I tried to like it. I really did. But it just wasn't for me. It's not a complete game, the environments feel dead, it felt slow, there weren't as many tracks as there are in other games, and it just bored me. I returned it before I took my morning dump.  PCars: This game is sexy af but the the ffb is an afterthought. I also hated that there is no championship mode available. In all honestly, it felt like a rushed simcade game. I did appreciate the graphics and variety of tracks, but the actual driving did not grab my attention. I didnt feel like I was a race car driver. The half-♥♥♥♥♥ one player mode, and nearly optionless career mode was very Star Wars Battlefront-esque by Electronic Sharts. I blame this microwave, insant gratification generation of subhumans for that game and this one for letting developers ravage them in this manner, although battlefront is much worse than PCars.  This game: Holy ♥♥♥♥. The driving in this game is ridiculous. The driving alone is so intense because of the physics engine and amazing ffb, that within one minute I was sold. You can feel it when you mess up, and when you're about to. That makes its so rewarding to run a good race or to recover/prevent a fishtail (which these cars do readily). The graphics are nice, not PCars level, but definitely pretty. The game also runs smoothly on my computer. I love the presentation and the tracks feel alive, but maybe its because you have to focus so hard to place! Last but most brilliant is the sound. My God the sound. The sound is the icing on the cake of the immersion this game provides. This game is the truth, and I'll go as far as to say it's my favorite racing game ever. Also, people talk ♥♥♥♥ about f2p, but this is a reasonable f2p model because they have discounts for bulk purchases and you can save money by buying what you like. In sum, ♥♥♥♥ the other games. This game is the real deal. The only cons for me is you can't set the length of the race by laps, only time (♥♥♥♥ you for that Sector), and the cars do an automatic 1080 if someone bumps you or you lose traction. It's ♥♥♥♥ing stupid the way these cars spin but I guess you cant be perfect. But literally, a ♥♥♥♥ing spectator could fart in the stands and you'll go ♥♥♥♥ing carouseling into a hotdog stand and last place.
8671	1	a	I've played rFactor2, Asseto Corsa, iRacing and Project Cars as well as RaceRoom. They each have their pros/cons, but for sheer overall experience ('fun') I'll play RaceRoom: Bathurst in the Audi R8 is a blast. The total immersion of sound, force feedback, driving feel, is awesome. As for free-to-play, well, that's just to get you going. If you want a real game, you can pick up a racing series pack for a few bucks that will give you a bunch of tracks and cars along with a mini-career. I've got the DTM 2013 and ADAC 2014 packs, there have decent variety.
8673	1	a	Well gotta say it's now my go to race sim , Cons purchacing process confusing and little pricey !! Pros too many lol very underated game !! The feel of cars, graphics and wow the sounds are awesome some features missing but are too be included in upcoming update i believe? If in doubt give it a try nothing to loose and everything to gain . If you played it long time ago give it another try all ready have 4 friends really enjoying it. (No idon't work for s3) just enjoying game
8675	1	a	One of the best racing games i have experienced with (finally) good AI.  Sound: 10/10 Cars: 9/10 Tracks: 10/10 Feeling: 11/10  btw we need more hillclimb map.  I really don't understand the negative comments...dudes! You have to purchase iRacing itself and then purchase more track and car while here the basic game is free! And try a pack for ex. DTM Experience, Gr. 5 or something and you will know why it's a GREAT game!!
8677	1	a	Very good racing game physics... still in development, but tracks and cars are over price
8679	1	a	 This is a sim racing title. Which means you need a wheel to play this game, preferably a Driving Force GT or better. A gamepad will simply not do. If you are looking for something along the lines of DiRT or Need for Speed, this game is definitely not for you.   Now that's out of the way, R3E, in it's current state, is a solid contender in the sim racing genre. Physics feel great and the force feedback is pretty much what you would expect from a racing sim. The game has fantastic sounds and AI that pretty much blows every other modern sims out there out of the water. However, the game does have major flaws which I will talk about further down.   Pros
8681	1	a	very very very very fun
8683	1	a	For racing enthusiasts or performance car fans this is a definite add to the 'garage'. The sound effects are first class as mentioned in many reviews. Definitely music to the ears and makes the adrenaline pump, simply outstanding. Having completed my racing license and tracking several sports/race cars over the years, I find the physics very good. Professional high calibre racers would be better suited to comment on the precision of the various cars.   It would be great to have a career mode introduced to add to the immersion, this would bring me back to the track more often.  The negative reviews with thumbs down due to pay to play model are both unfair and unrealistic. RacRroom make it possible to drive a couple cars and tracks free to sample the game, same as a demo of many other games/sims. Then if you like it, help keep the franchise going by purchasing some cars, tracks or both. If you don't enjoy it, nothing invested. For five or six bucks you can have a couple cars and learn to drive them properly. To truly learn a car and track takes a fair amout of seat time, so there is no need to drop a whole bunch of money right off the bat anyway, then, add as you go.  Having only sampled the online competions they seemed ok. This is not what I'm after personally so really have no valid input regarding online human v human competition.  In summary, this an excellent and fun sim; for a performance car or racing enthusiast you can't go wrong with RaceRoom. 
8685	1	a	I've been enjoying the Racing Room for quite a while now, but it was always missing the online racing aspect. Now those days are gone and i'm playing the heck out of it.  Me like.
8687	1	a	I LOVE THIS GAME TOO !!!!  EITHER IN MULTIPLAYER FOR THE SINGLE  Customisation championships, rules, AUDIO ENGINE FANTASTIC better than 90% of the current games . ULTRA MEGA ENHANCED (smooth at 60fps with all the ultra)  CARS great , SKIING REAL AND DIFFICULTY OF OPPONENTS 'customizable'.  FOR THOSE WHO LIKE RACING ( SIMULATION ) IS A GREAT GAME !!!! For those who like GRAPHICS . WILL PLAY Project Cars. 
8689	1	a	One of the best racing sims I've played on PC.    PROS:
8691	1	a	What a great game this has become. It feels a lot more sim than it used to and the inclusion of owned content through out game has opened this title up for me.   I wrote a review a while back and voted it down as it just felt wrong. Thought I better come back and put that right.  If you are thinking about spending some money there is quite often sales on and buying VRP from Raceroom works out better value. Also free content attracts idiots, try to stay away from the 'free servers' and you'll have a better time.
8693	1	a	Graphics are decent but personally I would have wished for a bigger improvement compared to RACE07, it doesn't look as much better as I expected. The sound is great, just watch a replay, switch to a fixed camera and turn up the volume. You will hear the car all the way round the track, it's really impressive. There isn't much AI at the moment, but you can do a track test with 6 AI-drivers and supposedly they already use the 'Adaptive AI' mode which does what it says, it adapts the AIs performance to yours.
8695	1	a	I had no idea what Sector3 was, and given the mixed reviews I was a bit recultant...but once I got in the game I was like 'Wow, the sounds! The sheer sense of speed! This feels like GTR!', then Googled the company and realize - it's Simbin!  The physics and force feedback is way better than Assetto Corsa, my previous favorite sim racer. And like I mentioned, the sound and sense of speed, is insanely good. Also this has more and better tracks. AC has modding, but I want good and solid original content, which Raceroom really has.   The pricing model is indeed stupid. Though apparently they have massive sales over the year, I heard you got the entire game for like $50 last Black Friday.
8697	1	a	Great game with great graphics, physics and everything you want from a driving SIM, not an arcade but a SIM. If you race and i know you do this is a must have.
8699	1	a	For a free game, this has a LOT of content! Ok, so maybe there isn't the best selection of tracks (the base game includes 3) but there is a considerable fleet of cars at your disposal, and let's be honest, when a game looks, sounds and feels as great as this one, who needs additional content? I've just picked up this game and am loving every bit of it! Can't wait to try it with a wheel :D
8701	1	a	This game has made good progress since it got released.  Good sumulator, lots of tracks and cars (to be purchased ofcourse) Graphics are ok, not very special but not bad either. Excellent audio, expecially the engine sounds are impressive.  Worth giving it a shot.  
8703	1	a	Quite possibly the best feeling racer of the new wave of sims.  The pricing structure is odd, but S3 has restructured it to a reasonable level.  If you're a hardcore racer, download the base and buy a few cars and courses. You'll be hooked. If you're looking for something arcadey, it's best you look elsewhere.
8705	1	a	Just needs flags, and the great thing is they are moving to a new game engine at any time which is improving graphics, allowing to race at night and more new stuff we do not know.It'll be a surprise for us!
8707	1	a	FINALLY! A game with the feeling of the old TOCA series! Cars that react to small bumps in the road instead of driving on tarmac textured glass which all today's big name games feel like.
8709	1	a	If you are a sim driver and have not tried this out, get it! Simulation drivers must have and for free like Simraceway/ 
8711	1	a	Amazing experience. This game got me back into Sim Racing. I tried a few other competitors before choosing this one such as Assetto Corsa and iRacing. The others are great but something about this one just keeps me coming back. The only downside is the micro-transactions but if you catch them at a discount they're a steal. Highly reccomend 9/10
8713	1	a	Would recommend getting the DLC but it isn't needed to have fun with this game
8715	1	a	I really love this game. The forcefeadback is hard but it's set like your in a car so that's cool. I don't like how you have to buy every individual car and pretty much all of the tracks but I guess that's ok. Overall this is a BADA** gam. It really feels like I'm playing iracing. The car sounds are really amazing too. Keep up the good work guys!!! ✋✋✋
8717	1	a	new update is AMAZING!! FAK NOOBS DISLIKE!!
8719	1	a	hard, for serious drivers, great game and lots of fun
8721	1	a	Since I got the game I have enjoyed every minute of it. Totally reccomend it to anyone into sim racers
8723	1	a	This game is absolutely fantastic! It is a pure joy to play. Sure, it doesn't have laser scanned content but who cars. I play games such as Assetto Crosa, tried pCars and iRacing but so far this game is in pair with the mentioned games! Definetely a game that is worth investing in it. It sure lacks few options but this game is still in a beta stage and many other games that are called 1.0 have less options available than this game.   Would I recommend this game? ABSOLUTELY!
8725	1	a	i absoultly love this game except that all the dlcs together cost 150 dollars, come on forza has more and the game is only 30-60 us dollars depening on which on and there is hundreds of cars and tons of maps. i recommend it but please lower the dlc prices. the game should cost 40-60 dollars and it comes with all the stuff
8727	1	a	Its pretty nice game,am very pleasured with graphic details but i think story in game should be better but i recommended this game anyway .
8729	1	a	I have to say firstly i don't write reviews, but i felt i had to as this game is massively under rated.  So much has changed i'm glad i gave it another go.  I thought it had lost its way a while back but things have certainly changed for the better. Definitely one of the best sims out there atm,  Graphics are good, 3 screens looks good, a little optimization would help so fps are more stable, that said its not an issue, i am running it on ultra where possible and it only drops to 58 occasionally with vsync on. The 980's are coping nicely. Sounds are very realistic and clear, surround is good. The AI are the best in any racing sim right now. The cars feel good, the feedback to the Fanatec Clubsport is excellent, FWD WTCC cars are spot on, that said the BMW is awesome, driven correctly it will stay with and often beat the FWD cars which can be tough on certain circuits. Had a lot of online races and thoroughly enjoyed every one of them, just need to be able to host servers ourselves but the multiplayer clearly states alpha so i'm happy to be able to even race online right now. There are a nice selection of tracks, would like to see some more from the UK but that's my preference. I purchased the majority of my content while on sale, not sure i could justify the full price to be honest as it seems too expensive as it marketed as a 'FTP' game, which kind of leaves you feeling mislead and maybe a little cheated.  My suggestion, try it, get some content on next sale, you will be pleasantly surprised. The free stuff didn't appeal to me at all, the paid content obviously is a lot better (for me). Never know the dev's may realise all they need to do is sell it as a normal game none of this 'FTP' marketing, then people should buy it. Simples  
8731	1	a	Absolutley amazing, love the physic and feel of tis game...I suggest you play it :P
8733	1	a	Realistic &amp; fun if you enjoy racing realism this is for you.
8735	1	a	I'll be quick about it. It's a racing sim. Get it. Play the free competition challenges to see if you like it (no reason not to imo). Then and only then consider buying some vrp's from their store when on offer (-30% sth) and buy ONLY packs on offer (avoid getting single tracks/cars since they are included in packs which at some point will be on offer). Stick to my advice above and check it out. They have leaderboard challenges almost every week so you can try new cars/tracks even though you don't own them for free!  Check it out:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PczVKr9ZYGs&amp;list=PL1PUkgVzQJU56UXgEAu-GU3LM2dMiYhEF 
8737	1	a	Don't let people turn you away from this game if you really like to race. It is a very good simulation but there are some that would say otherwise due to not taking the time to get to know the physics model and the fact that the gas pedal has more positions than just nothing to floored.  Now thats not to say that this game doesn't have flaws. After all what games these days don't have a flaw here and there? The only big flaw for me is that the AI has vastly superiour grip to the player but you can get close with the right amount of tuning and the Devs are working on fixing that issue right now. Online races in this game are a real blast in Get Real mode but first I beg you to log practice time in this mode. Based on the multiplayer races I have seen lately people think that get real mode is going to be like driving a normal car in real life.  Now the problem with that kind of thinking is that the engines on these cars are made to go much faster than a normal car that you would drive daily so Get Real mode takes some practice but after you master it it is definately the best mode. Another thing the devs might add soon is an offline mode which will be great for unexpected times of internet outage since you would still be able to log some track time if you want.  In short yes this game has some flaws but so does every other game ever developed so if you really like racing give this a try. I mean its free so you've got nothing to lose except a little bit of time if you don't like the game but wouldn't you have burned that time gaming anyway?
8739	1	a	I tell you what... Driving a car in this game is absolutely amazing. Great FFB, car movements are so realistic, sounds are awesome, graphic is absolutely good and a weaker PC can handle it perfectly. But!!!!! Driver and steering wheel animations are not really good, but of course you can turn off these. About the content... Free content is terrible, so if you want to ENJOY the game you have to pay a lot(in cases). Typical P2E (pay to enjoy) game, which destroys the soul inside me... And THIS is, where developers made a terrible mistake. Would be better if we should pay...let's say 40-50 euros for the game and then all further content will be available. I bet, much more players would play this really-really good game. One of the best sim I've tried!! If you have the money (I have it, but this paying system f***s my brain to hell) this game is one of the best choiche. 6/10 because of the money suc*er dev team :(
8741	1	a	Picked this up since it was free, figured I'd give it a try. First night playing, it was ok. The graphics are good. The physics seem good while providing a challenging driving experience. Although it did take me another day to get my FFB sorted. There really is no explanation for what some of the settings do. (or a short rather canned one)  Once I got my FFB dialed in, the game/sim really started to shine. I use the Logitech G27 with pedals and H-shifter. A wheel really is the preferred way to get the best experience, though I'm sure there are a handful of controller users out there who can rip it up pretty good.  The sounds really are pretty amazing. Especially when you start to drive different cars. Considering I've got 12 hours and 128 laps under my belt in one weekend, its safe to say I'm hooked.   If the devs can continue in the right direction with development, R3E has a lot of potential to be great! And don't be turned off by paid content until you at least try the free stuff. Other racing sim organizations (not mentioning any names) do the same thing.  =====Update 02/13/2015======  After 1100+ laps and over 2 days of total in game time I can say I'm still hooked. The most recent update Feb 2015 improved the AI and optimized the graphics. Dedicated servers are coming soon. I believe this year which will open up online racing leagues.  I own almost all the cars. All tracks and all packs but the hill climb. Yes a little pricey, but worth it IMO. The devs stay in constant contact with the community which is more than I can say for other games/sims. New tracks and cars are still in the works, the most recent upcoming new track, Sonoma and the Cadillac CTS VR coupe to be released soon as paid content. R3E has only gotten better since I've been playing it and it was pretty good when I started with it anyway.   R3E is definitely to be taken seriously among other race sims currently on the market.
8743	1	a	Game is worth to own now. Pay attention to the regular sales to grab nice stuff for a not so much of a rip off price. Two car packs are worth even w/o sale for the low price: DTM 2013 and DTM 1992. Physics and graphics are top notch.
8745	1	a	So here I am writing a review for RaceRoom Racing Experience. So my first impressions of the game are good, in terms of gameplay the sounds are immaculate and very realistic. The force feedback you recieve through the wheel are really good and racing is challenging especially in multiplayer.  Pros:  -Great Sounds -Great Force Feedback -Car models look good -Racing is a challenge and you feel like you are in a real car -Has support for all controllers (wheels and joysticks and controllers) -You can make your own overlay for a race and broadcast it live -If you drive the wrong way you ghost meaning that trolls cannot crash you out using a head on collision -Physics and handling are very realistic -Different modes: Novice, Amateur and Realistic -Decent Graphics and fps with support for high end and low end spec computers -Good default overlay -So many things that can be changed in settings  Cons:  -The free mode only comes with 3 (I think) car series and 2 (I think) tracks -No pit crew/garage interior -No Career mode where you can make your own racer and have any sort of car improvement -Mirror visibility is not great and hard to depict cars until they are too close to try and defend  I realise this game is still in development and i am looking forward to more content but I think sector3 studios have done a fantastic job on this game so its a thumbs up from me.  Therefore I would rate it 9/10 as there could be a few things that could be improved (like adding some more free dlc etc.) but it surprised me with how good the gameplay was.
8747	1	a	One of the best sim i ever played.
8749	1	a	That's great game, and also buy DTM 2014 DLC, too.
8751	1	a	After almost two years of floaty physics, stuttering, bad communication, outrageous prices and lack of racing, R3E is finally turning around.   Regular sales bring the content to more sensible prices, the force feedback has been tightened up to give better information about the car, the physics are more precise and very detailed and the setup makes a big difference. Most of the racing right now is in the DTM series, but the challenges are fun and allow you to try several cars and tracks without paying a dime.   Visually, it's a bit bright and bold, but the environments look good and clear. Visibility and details are high, and the shadows passing on the dashboard look really nice. The performance on High settings with 8x AA with a 750ti is 60 fps when there's only one car, so I think the optimization is pretty good as well.  The sounds are probably the best you'll hear in a racing game, whether it's the samples themselves or just the richness of the chassis squeaking, the transmission, the tires, etc. Everything is there and sounds great. No other game comes close.  The interface is still complex and confusing, and some options are only available from the main menu. The FFB is very adjustable, but the settings are not explained much, so it takes a lot of fiddling to get everything right. For me, that means G25 and TH8RS. The modern cars don't default to auto-clutch, which is lame.   Because the game looks and sound so good, and now that the FFB is finally letting the new and tighter physics shine through, Raceroom is becoming a killer racing game. I never thought it could be possible, but out of this could arise a GTR3 people have hoped for. In the meantime, doing time trials, challenges and racing in DTM is a lot of fun.  To newcomers: skip the free content and go straight for the competitions, this is where the higher quality content is. It cycles through cars and tracks regularly, so you can sample stuff until you find what you like. The freebies are still the old wobbly garbage from 2012, it seems. I think everything will be updated over time.
8753	1	a	One of the best racing games on steam
8755	1	a	very good , with good mechanics but it need money to play with some good cars  
8757	1	a	awsome looking game overall detail of the cars are amazing but impossible to play without a steering wheel. Overall its good nothing special though would have liked to have seen more free content (warning) only download if you have a wheel setup.
8759	1	a	The game is great! Especially the new multiplayer alpha, but what I don't like is the handling on the vehicles. All I'm saying is it could be a bit better.
8761	1	a	Very good sim nice mix of gaming and sim racing, great physix very fun for gamer and racer alike.
8763	1	a	I have no idea why there are so many negative reviews. Nevertheless, the reviews were so bad about a year ago that I didn't touch it. So I did wait until Dec 2015 to try it out after all the patches and changes that seemed to make it worth buying. I race in iRacing, PCars, Assetto Corsa, FM, FH, and now RaceRoom. The graphics inside the cockpit and looking out to the opponents is probably the best among these sims providing you have a decent PC and can max out the graphics. I give it a 9.5/10 for graphics. The physics are also very good since you can adjust many settings in the FFB. So if you make a few adjustments, then I would easily say 9/10 on phyiscs. And with all the adjustments you get for the feel, then nearly a perfect. The gameplay is focused on DTM and GT3 in my opinion and that is pretty much why I bought it. No other sims have anything really in the DTM class although I am hoping PCars gets into DTM more. So if you like DTM, I can tell you this is the best sim for DTM. I haven't had any issues at all and have to say the negative onslaught this game gets is just not accurate. But there seems to be a few issues. Like with the fuel and tire wear set to real, they don't seem to ever go down. It's 100% all the time so I think that is a bug. And the AI is annoying until you learn how to avoid them. But this is one of the best sims out there in my opinion, especially DTM and GT3. I just don't understand how people can spend 15 min on a game and slam the heck out of it. Their connectivity issues and setup is more than likely their own setup problem. Yes, it needs a little help with car setups too like adding tire pressure...lol But the game feels and looks excellent, It's worth the money for DTM for sure.  Update: 4/30/2016 - RaceRoom is Awesome! I've waited a month after the 3/31/2016 update that massively improved the GT3 and Prototype physics. The new physics and new FFB settings, new car setup, especially for GT3, ADAC GT Masters, DTM, and the new Audi P1 along with Nordschleife puts this sim to the stellar level in my opinion. In addition, the fuel and tire wear now works finally. Neverthelesss, the new FFB meter to check for clipping is very nice. I am very critical of physics and so you know where I am coming from, Assetto Corsa and iRacing have the top slot with PCars a close second. Race Room was just behind PCars. Unfortunately, Forza just doesn't have the physics at these levels, e.g. you cannot feel the rubber on the road and utilze braking to control the cornering accurately in Forza Motorsport at least yet. So Forza is last in the physics ranking among all these. But I am now putting RaceRoom up there at the Assetto Corsa and iRacing level. I am at the point of saying the physics in Race Room, at least for the DTM, ADAC, GT3 and Prototype classes, is possibly even better than Assetto Corsa and iRacing. The sound in Race Room is also stellar if not the best among the aformentioned sims and I am not even using 7.1 yet just stereo. Race Room does not get the recognition it deserves....another point is I am astonished it's onlyh using DX9c where all the others I've mentioned are on DX11 or even DX12. So it blows me away they are getting this level of crisp graphics viewing the opponents cars and interior that they do....congrats Race Room for pulling that off.
8765	1	a	I don't often review games (or anything else), but with all the thumbs down this has gotten I decided it needed my input. First let me say that I raced real cars for 9 years on both ovals and road courses. I've also sim raced on and off since about 1992. I'm not an expert on sim racing, but I've tried most of the major players and R3E is among the very best -- I find the physics to be superb, at least when used with a good wheel and pedals. I can't comment on how it plays on kb, controller or anything else and frankly I don't care.   One of the problems with sim racing is how to represent the loss of traction that one *feels* in the real world through balance, touch and seat of the pants. A common perception in the sim world is that a game is realistic when it is very difficult, but the real world isn't like that -- vehicles only get very difficult close to the limit. I think R3E does an admirable job of balancing difficulty without crossing the line into 'arcade'. Is it better than iRacing or Assetto Corsa? I don't know....that's really on a car-by-car basis for me, but some of them are better and none that I've driven are really bad (and even iRacing has had some stinkers).  I also don't think the 'free to play' system is that bad. You can have some great fun without ever buying anything! Certain track and car combinations are always available (for free!) in the 'competitions'. These are really just hot-lap contests, but they are fun and you get to try out the content.....and it is still free. Raceroom is expensive if you buy all the DLC, but I just don't see a need for that -- just buy whatever series you want to race in, and if you are really cheap just by one car in each class. Either way it is still a lot cheaper than iRacing.   The downsides of Raceroom:  -the severs are usually empty, but then I don't use this for online racing.  - the AI can be a bit aggressive, but are otherwise pretty good.  -can't save setups (really????). I've heard this is coming in the next update
8767	1	a	  Brief Review    R3E (RaceRoom Racing Experience) is a free-to-play racing simulator, which means you can download it for free, and drive a small selection of cars and tracks. The rest of the content is purchased using 'vRP': R3E's own currency. vRP can be bought for a reasonable price, or can be won in competitions. This makes R3E somewhat of a budget friendly sim    Pros and Cons     Pros   Audio Audio Audio FFB Satisfying FFB kick on gear changes Overal good physics   Cons   Cars have over exaggerate grip levels Pricey for some but not as bad as iRacing    An Ending    Did i mention the Audio is spot on
8769	1	a	its like a demo, for extra cars,maps you have to pay
8771	1	a	This game is rated criminally low on Steam, I guess because people want everything for free. Kinda ridiculous. I agree some of the content is too pricey, but for a reasonable price you can grab two or three packs of cars/tracks and have a ton of fun.  The opponent AI and the sound are the best currently available. Handling/physics is great, maybe just a notch behind AC, and the polish of the UI and menus is simple but well done and doesn't feel like a beta like so many sims do these days. No better game out right now if you want to simulate a touring car race season.  If you're a sim racing fan, you should absolutely give this a try and see if you want to buy some additional content. It's one of the top few sims available!
8773	1	a	...And I thought Gran Turismo was brutal (S-Class License in that game was not easy to obtain, BTW. Fortunately, not a requirement in this one. I also beat GT3 and most of GT4. So I'm familiar with the overall brutality of these simulators.). Then again, it's been ages since I last played a simulation racing game (At least 5 years worth of rust on me); and now with more accurate simulation settings as such, ugh. Made a decent personal time on Get Real (without shattering my car or breaking the engine), but I needed Novice to get a better handle of when to brake overall for next time (I can survive, at least, but I'm nowhere near leaderboard-ready yet at time of post). You botch the braking anywhere (especially blind corners and chicanes), and you can mess up your entire lap, or go off course, or 180-1080 your car, and invalidate your lap (no shortcutting like I used to in GT and NFS; also no more using other cars as guardrails on certain turns either :( ).  Not stopping me from playing this more, and maybe getting an expansion pack or two to have more cars to drive with and more tracks to drive on. However, as precise I can get with a keyboard, I lack pressure sensitivity in order to draw a bead more precisely; so my skills are a tad biased (better with a gamepad for these kinds of games). +20.5 seconds (1:43.334 on a track) from 1st place (Leaderboards, that is) is not good enough for me. I gotta shave off more time... If I can clear +10 seconds from 1st, then I'll be a happier driver. +5, and I'll be impressed with myself. This game is not easy, because it's less game, and more simulator. The physics are quite familiar and rather unforgiving (like reality would be), especially in Get Real (and that mode also permits fine-tuning your car's aerodynamics, gear-shift ratios, and just about everything else under the hood; and tire wear is also quite unforgiving too, so keep those in check along with your fuel). If you seek a casual racing experience, I suggest a different game, lest you want to lose some keyboards or controllers in frustration. It can become casual, however, if you're a pro at this kind of stuff.  Been awhile since I've had such a detailed racing experience, so thumbs up on bringing back my memories of Gran Turismo (In due time, I'll see you guys on the Nürburgring Course (up to 10 minutes per-lap, and that's with skill and a good car; BIIIG Course (28.265 km long). An ultimate test for drivers, both skill and endurance. Look it up. In GT4, my best time was about 9 minutes, or slightly less than that, and even so, I had difficulties there.)). However, only other (personal) setback is that your real name is visible (security and such, I guess). Just a friendly heads-up for anyone else that feels like crashing into walls and cars non-stop (eg- signing up to play). The heads-up is also for those that would end up broadcasting, and still want to remain anonymous; I suggest going somewhere else for privacy while broadcasting publicly.  I can imagine how this will play with Oculus support. Speaking of which, the graphics are 10/10; runs smoothly with high settings, even for older machines like mine, and the graphics are a beauty overall; the sound is also rather pretty too, for you gearheads. If you want an immersive driving experience, or want to relive an A-Spec GT experience, I recommend this. Plus, it's free to play. Despite the 10GB download (mostly locked content), what's not to love? I suggest building some experience and skill before investing in any new cars/tracks/DLC packs. At least, know you can handle it first, before burning your money on this, and then giving it a negative review from poor judgement user-side.  See you on the leaderboards, and by chance, on the tracks.
8775	1	a	this game is fantastic. the sounds are unreal. so are the physics. for a free game i am impressed with it.
8777	1	a	Reason's to get this game.  1: It's a Simulator. Meaning real life-like driving, if on Get Real difficulty. Other difficulties are fun to play as well, depending on your driving skill.  2. The ability of being able to buy games with-in the simulator that allow you to experience even more real life-like driving content.  3. If you are not fortunate to buy the games with-in the simulator, then this game come with 3 free cars with skin packs plus 3 tracks with different routes.  4. Again, if not fortunate to pay for the games you also can race for content, do well and you along with 10 possible others can win content.  5. Regardless of any content you may or may not of bought, there is always players out there that you can challenge yourself against. A community to find drivers and challenge there records or them yourselves in multiplayer, you choose.  6. This game takes skill to play and if you like to test your skill without the 'DEATH' chance, then the creators went a step farther and allow you to buy for your home reality chambers. Fully customizable driving frames that allow you to take control behind a steering wheel having the feel of a real life like racing experience.  7. The initial simulator is 'FREE'  8. Much more inside.....
8779	1	a	Hi All,  My Name Is Luke and i am not the best at typeing up reviews so please dont hate on me i will start with good things about this sim and bad things id just like to say thank you to all the clean racing fellows,   So first of in the base game you get 5 FREE CARS in wich some are Aquila CR1 Sports GT, 134 Judd V8, Saleen S7R, DMD P20, and a Canhard R52 There is many diffrent skins that are free that you can use in game, You can Buy additional Cars Trought there online store or trought steam i buy from the store its cheap has sales like crazy anyway back to this review you Get 3 Race Tracks  Lake View HillClimb has 2 Layouts  Portimao Circuit Has 4 Layouts RaceRoom Raceway has 5 Layouts Those Tracks are fun to race on and you can buy more tracks such as Spa-Francorchamps and many more, There is also Weekly compettion where you can try out cars and maps and set a good time you can also win VR Points which you can spend on cars or tracks which is really cool Ah Damm i forgot to mention that after this new update there is more FREE cars such as Cougar C14-2, Mistral M531, and some other cars but its fun,  I brought DTM 2013 and i got 3 Cars and Many Tracks i recommend you buy The Whole Pagacke rather than one car since you will safe so much money   http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=507680049  I Race with an Xbox360 Pad since my steering wheel got fked but It is really fun even tho im racing with an Xbox360 pad i still can get a good time The Game is For Casual players and hardcore simmers   Now i dont know if that has helped you out but i will add more to this review   Anyway the badpart if you will race you will find trolls that will want to ram you and you cant do anything about it :( i know i cry also Graphics are not the best but its ok because this sim is fun   http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=506916855  Multiplayer is really fun no lagg so far and yeah thats it i would rate this game 8/10 &lt; kinda feel like i should give 10/10  Also Feel Free to Join This Steam Group and Disccous RRRE   http://steamcommunity.com/groups/RRREIG     IF YOU DONT THINK THAT THIS REVIEW WAS HELPFULL PLEASE COMMENT AND LET ME KNOW WHY. 
756	0	a	The game itself is OK, but the program is so hard to get running properly. Every time they update it, it screws up the graphics. It fails to start, fails to go into full screen, gets stuck on the start video. Just a whole load off issues running the game. Tried it on 3 PC's and generally get a mix of all of the above issues.
757	0	a	I tried almost every simulation outh there including iRacing , and i was excited for a new simbin title , cuz im a fan of simbim from way back with GT legends and GTR/GTR2 , so i was expecting a good sim, insted i got some Acrila cars that u can not get used to , just like iRacing , u cant feel the road , u can master a track but u cant master the grip, its just unconected... no way neer GTR ad GTlegends and Race07...i dont care about graphics so thats my opinion on phisics and engine, a big fail from me , but i understand they wanna make it more fun and driver frendly but in there aprouch the have missed me .  Now a little bit of a content rewiev Its not a free game , its a demo, if u want a game with content u have to buy it and its not cheep, i hate it , its like Star citizen , selling u a model of something and pricing it not as much as star citizen but still, its a 3D model, and when 10 000 ppl buy it u end u with 50 000euros in cash, does it cost that much to designe a 3D model of a car, NO, so what is it , a rip off is what it is , they dont want to make a game, thats why u cant play it standalone with no internet conection, they wann sell stuff like Star citizen cuz they have seen the amoun of money SC earned robing off kids with money, Im OK with that , rip off all kids with money i couldnt care less, but u wont get it from me , i want a racing simulation , that will work even if my internet connection is down, i want to pay for a game not a car or a track. I couldnt care less what tracks name is , or what car am i driving , as long as its a nice track and a good car phisics ,so i play would play rFactor with unlicensed cars and track that work good rather then pay 200e for RaceRoom that has all licensed cars that u can not feal and have to pay for a door panel and tyers .. thats what it boilds down too, they would sell i virtual wheels and windshields if they could but they cant so they sell cars and tracks, im not in too that, so what are the alternatives  Alternatives GSC as Game stock car 2013 is a better sim on every level, exept multipayer but that will improove when ppl realise that its the best sim on the market , apart from iRacing that so expensive u cant even consider it in a category of 20-30e and doesnt feel as good as GSC Also Aseto corsa is better then Race room, and its cheeper , but its not finished  So thats my review , boils down too if u have money there is no reason not to try to buy content, but if u suport financial models like that u will end up paying for wind shields ,rims and car skins, maybe even P2W like high octane fuel. If u are smart, u will suport games that dont try to get as much money from u but insted focuse on giving u a pleasure of racing against AI and ppl with as much content as u like , with mods, oficial content etc....so for me there is just GSC 2013 and Aseto Corsa that are on that level of racing, i Racing too but thats for profesional drivers not for a casual gamer..Race room expirience is a money generating machine not a racing simuator , just like World of Tanks is, Star Citisen and all other so called free games . Thank u simbin for not existing any more and making room for real racing gamers over at Asetto corsa and GSC. over and out
758	0	a	It looks good. It runs relatively well (when you can defeat the twin bosses of patch updates and network connectivity issues). However, as I won't shell out an excessive amount of money to unlock the full 'experience', this game isn't for me. I understand that you get what you pay for, but I'd rather drop $50 on a solid racing sim instead of being nickle and dimed for half a game.
8781	1	a	Great sensation with my G27 and pure sound! What a pleasure to drive and try to improve my lap time in each track.  Now, I'm waiting for Spa-Francorchamps and multiplayer....
8783	1	a	its a full on racing sim not just some arcade game. download if you enjoy sim racing games. in my opinion it would play best with a wheel 
8785	1	a	Great graphics awsome control.Just love it :)
8787	1	a	Great graphics awsome control.Just love it :)
8789	1	a	Great Fun and you dont need a super computer to be able to play which is great.
8791	1	a	Very good game. There is still a lot to improve but the foundation is solid.  I don't understand all the negativity around R3E. Yes you have to buy stuff and yes the free to play doesn't offer 20 cars or tracks for free. The F2P content isn't all that bad you can join competitions and race cars and tracks you don't have. The content isn't that expensive also.  Good physics and real cars and liveries, superb sound, good AI. Can't wait to see whats next.  Better then ProjectCars as a total package.
8793	1	a	If you are okay with the payment-system (which I am) it's an awesome game. Sounds is the best in the genre, physics okay, and new content often
8795	1	a	Gday,I think this game is one of the best if not the best sim i have played.I have put many hours in other sims like Assetto corsa,GSCE,etc,Raceroom has set the standard i think...The sounds in this game are second to NONE,the way it makes you feel you are acually at the track.The FFB and the road feel spot on.If you like simbin games you will love this.It has pitstops and the AI isnt as bad as what people say..it is much better than AC,s AI,but not yet as good as GSCE AI,,this game is still in beta tho,If you love racing sims as much as i do you have to try it out..Its a free to play game with 3 tracks and 5 free cars,The content they have for sale is well worth it,you can also test drive any car anytime before you buy it.The only thing i dont like about this game,and its the only thing,is that you have to be online always..even to play single player, you have to be on the server..I really hope they change this as my internet is not the best all the time.Happy racing......Cheers
8797	1	a	umm idk but i can only be one car what's up with that? 
8799	1	a	This is honestly a really solid racing sim.  If all you want to do is burn around a track trying to beat your previous time and you get immense satisfaction from the realism of the graphics and sound, then this is an amazing game.  If you came here looking for a polished product; leave now. You will not find anyhting like GT or Assetto Corsa for free. I can assure you. It has no multiplayer yet or even a race mode but I just enjoy driving around the circuit in the various default cars admiring the engine sounds and brake squeaks.  TL;DR - This is about the EXPERIENCE, not the progression
8801	1	a	its a full on racing sim not just some arcade game. download if you enjoy sim racing games. in my opinion it would play best with a wheel 
8803	1	a	just touched it for some hours, but if you have a ffb wheel and 5.1 sound you gotta love this one.
8805	1	a	Bang tidy if you have the hardware to run it and the wallet to fund it (free to play) mmmm? free to try more like. if you want the good stuff, you'll have to pay extra although it is worth it. If you have not got a wheel setup then go elsewhere as this came is hard to use with a pad and you will not be competitive. 
8807	1	a	Great ! i say great that´s all  perfect!   Oculus support !  set your DK2 as primary in extendet mode   add “-vr to the Launch Options (under Properties in your Steam game list)   and Enjoy!
8809	1	a	Very good game well engineered runs smoothly great game
8811	1	a	The pricing model could be a little better but there is a lot of work put into this game. Leaderboard challenges, every combination of car and track is possible. The multiplayer is in alpha, but i didn't notice any jerking of cars on the road unless that player has 500 + ping. They will add much much more including weather and a night/day shift. It's still beta but it's coming along nicely. Definitly the best out there at the moment.
8813	1	a	YOU SHOULDN'T VIEW THIS AS A FREE TO PLAY GAME.  Yes it's listed as free-to-play but it's really more of a base platform for future games (listed as DLC). You get a few cars and less than a handful of tracks to try out, but the rest of it requires money. You should approach this as something like DCS World, where it's used more of a launcher for other games/addons.  While the whole pay a metric ♥♥♥♥♥on of money for cars sucks, and something I wish SimBin/Sector3 never did, the actual DLC is topnotch. I wouldn't even call it DLC because the amount of content is equivalent to a whole new game. It still runs on the gmotor/ISImotor engine so graphics aren't the best but it's still stunning and clean. Physics aren't the best and it still feels very gMotor-y, but they still feel amazing to drive and believable. AI reminds me a lot of GTR2, fast, aggressive and (for the most part) clean, they do tend to divebomb from time to time. The thing that stands out the most is the sounds. Hands down the best on the market when it comes to racing sims. You can hear subtle variations in engine tone, track surface, debris and the little squeeks and creaks of your suspension and chassis. You can even tell which tyres are locking up based on sound. Total immersion.   It had a really rough (and imo, horrible) start but SimBin finally got their act together and I'm starting to enjoy it more and more. It's not at the level of AC, iR, or rF2 but it's damn good.
8815	1	a	good game, good graphics but it needs some fixes here and there but overall i recoomend this game 8/10
8817	1	a	Great game! I downloaded DTM 2014...REAL, COMPLETE, WITH ALL THE ORIGINAL TRACKS AND CARS WITH ALL THE LIVRARIES! Really amazing...you'll never get bored!!
8819	1	a	Very realistic and very fun multiplayer experience
8821	1	a	Alot of reviews from people that won't give this game much time - Granted, I spent a good while getting the graphics and feeling (FFB etc) right but you will love it once you find that sweet spot. I find the physics of every car much more alive and engaging than similar vehicles on say, Project Cars or Assetto Corsa, with the force feedback (Using a G27) and the sounds being top notch. Easily the best of any racing sim IMO.  The mix of content is fantastic and the track list is a brilliant! - A load of tracks you actually want to drive, not a load of soul-less modern build tracks. Not many games can boast the opportunity to jump from a mental super tuned Zakspeed Capri, to a 2014 WTCC Lada, to a BMW Z4 GT3 then in to a 1992 Audi Quattro DTM. And then choose to take each either up a hillclimb, round Bathurst or to Indianapolis!  And the graphics, once dialled up are great. I run a GTX970 and that runs everything maxed. Yet while you can see its a game, everything looks very real.  The whole, 'free to play, but each thing costs extra, so you end up spending a tone if you get in to it', idea sucks. But with the prices being no so bad, it could be worst. I could be in to iRacing.  Give it a try. Buy some decent content and let the game develop over time as you get in to it and you will love it. The Sector3 forum is a great place to check up on what to expect in future releases aswell and what the team are working on - plus, if you don't like something, post it on there and they will have a look and you never know, they could sort it more to your liking.
8823	1	a	This review has to be a very mixed bag. First off let me say I've been with this game from the start. From closed beta till now. I've seen it go from meh.. to a very decent game. Probably one of the best racing titles I've ever played. I always knew that if anybody could get a racing title right it would be these guys. It has the possibilites of blowing GTR 2 out of the water. Yes it could be that good!  However there are some very serious issues here. One is the pitstops. Flat after the Oct. 20 patch they don't work. I understand that pitsops in custom championships are coming and that's okay. They weren't originally advertsied to begin with after all. I can live with that. Impatiently but I'll live till then. However it's the broken pitsops in ADAC 2014 experience and DTM 2014 experience that upset me. Can't say about DTM 2015 as I don't own it and from the looks of it I may never. Working pitstops were advertised for the DTM and ADAC 2014 cars. Heck I owned the DTM 2013. It was the only reason to buy the newer set.    In ADAC 2014 the player's car drives straight through the pits without stopping. Resulting in disqualification for not stopping. In DTM 2014 your car stops but the pit doesn't seem to count. You guessed it resulting in your disqualification. These were advertised features. We have to assume they had this worked out before the advertised it , right? Guess not!    There are many other issues and to their credit they working on them. As the recent hotfix suggests but it's not enough. One main quirk if you decide to step into this game, is BEWARE THE PATCHES! They generally break twice as much as they fix. One over the summer brought the whole fool game down. In it's current state I couldn't recommend this game unless you are very patient. And it will be tested, trust me! It is a near brilliant racing title with lot's of racing fun though and if and only if you're willing to hang with it you will love it and hate it and love it and hate it.... You get the picture. I gave this title a thumbs up because it doesn't totally deserve a thumbs down! However you have been warned!   As for the 503 errors that everyone is experiencing. I can't say as mine thankfully have been limited. I must be living right or lucky. Also I need to add that I play only single player not multiplayer. So my review can't address any issues there as I haven't seen them. I really would like to give this game a thumbs sideways but can't. Hence the thumbs up.
8825	1	a	the game is cool and all but there needs to be a mode like carrer so u could make ur own racer and build a car and add some more american mucsle and not just the ford mustang add some like a 1969 dodge charger a chevelle ,camaro,nova etc 
8827	1	a	I recommend you TRY it, because its free and there is no downside to buying it. I mostly got it to try out my racing setup a while ago and it was worth playing.
8829	1	a	Brought this with some hesitation , going by some of the old reveiws i thought this might not be that good,but took a chance , Well i am glad i did , the handling is great , the force feedback works really well, (brought dtm 2105 and wtcc 2014), The sound is amazing best car sound in a game yet, Graffics on par with asseto corsa not as good as project cars, i have both those games so at this satge only about a hours game play i feel its control and grit of racing could make this one of the best race simms yet, Raceroom have come along way and is listening to the people who buy their games. The only negative is their price structure.  I will come back in a week or two to give a better review , but for now ill say well worth buying especially the packs i brought.  ps dont go by the free demo , no where near as good as the new stuff in my view,
8831	1	a	Absolutely fantastic. Thank you.
8833	1	a	Classic Simbin stuff with nice graphics. 9/10, 1 point for the fairly expensive content.
8835	1	a	The best sound and FFB of any racing game at the moment and everything else is on par with the others such as Assetto and pCars. Buy into it as much or as little as you want. Stand out for me is Zolder, Portimao, Laguna Seca and of course the Nordshleife.
8837	1	a	Absolutely fantastic. Thank you.
8839	1	a	great game !!!!
8841	1	a	This is the best racing simulation there is right now.
8843	1	a	This is by far the best game Simbin have produced. The physics are spot-on, and, aside from a few licensing issues with the RUF brand and a few iconic tracks which are currently lacking (though I'm assured they're coming soon), this is a very complete game. I bought into this during the alpha stage when I was taken aback by the graphics and attention to detail in their fictional Raceroom track, and I haven't once regretted it. I think the likes of Assetto Corsa and Project Cars can only be substantially better by having a better selection of road-going cars and the Nordschleife, available as standard.
8845	1	a	This game is an epic game for racing yes you have to buy some thing but this game is really epic but its all on your driving.
8847	1	a	The more I play, the more I like this game. It has several strengths compared to other similar games. I really like the selection of cars and tracks, and the cars in each class are very well balanced so that every car is a potential winner. They've also really nailed it with a good mix of classics and modern racing series like DTM and WTCC.  The controls, force feedback and sound is nothing less than fantastic! Beats everything else on the market hands down. Graphics are also top notch. The game has had a rough start, but now it's really starting to shine.  Laser scanned Nordschleife is also coming soon, which will make the game even more better. :)
8849	1	a	Very cool game. its amazing for a free racing game. Car sounds are almost identecal and the tracks are very real feeling too. I like how this game supports steering wheels. Very fun
8851	1	a	Out of all the latest racing sims coming out on Steam lately this is the one I keep coming back too, content keeps evolving and improving with every update, track selection is fantastic, cars handle and sound awesome, FFB has also improved from what it was 6 months ago with more updates to come, its also free to play with some great compititions to dip into if you just want to try out the free stuff.......Highly recommended!                                       
760	0	a	Can't play singleplayer Offline
8853	1	a	Game title 'RaceRoom Racing Experience' speaks for itself - good for who wants to get some race experience. I like this simulator. But, ... on my opinion, there are two big issues with simulator. First of all, it pricey. Second, you do not get a change to test a car or a track before buy it. This is ridiculous. Give us a chance to test it before buy it or at least possibility to return it back.
8855	1	a	this game is extremely realistic in terms of physics and AI physics it offers a real racing experience and feedback as it also provides a full configuration and tuning features to setup the cars and the controller.
8857	1	a	Great Sim but expensive and have lack of content and no MODS But i like it
761	0	a	Very Expensive content and just a few gaming options, graphics not that amazing. Anyway...waste of time and money...lots of money!
762	0	a	too long developing it, until I can choose my own AI cars to race against, this is bottom of the pile.
763	0	a	Its fun, you can use controller for this and it is very sharp and visually pleasing. However, the biggest problem is you can only get so far before you realize you must pay alot of money for new car, vinyl and track. There is no earn yourself a new ride with dedication and racking podium finishs. you spend the money just to race with new vehicle or tackle a different that was not already given to you. if you hate to pay-to-play... please stay away from this game it is no for you.  Not to be recommended to the Need for Speed (of any kind) / arcad'ee kids. If you were looking for alternative to Forza Motorsports on Xbox or an answer to Playstation's Gran Turismo, u may survive. This games mechanics and handling is similar to the console sim racers, but this PC sim is way much more serious then the console racers. this serious racing sim has a massive leaderboard filled with nothing but competitive times that other user across the world have placed. it more fun to race against ur friends times then some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ pro race driver from Germany. it will be a pain in the ♥♥♥ if u hoped to be immersed in the game.  Again, the controls are solid, the game is sharp and presentable. but the pay to play more will most definitely kill your good vibes.
8859	1	a	RaceRoom Racing Experience is a thing where you put the lads on the line so they get to the end faster than the other people. Choose from over one gender of driver to completely personalise your profile. Interaction and User experience is more akin to that of a misaligned shoulder cavity but please don't count that against it, it doesn't know any better. Believe me when I say I'm not sure what RaceRooms are but I think we can all agree that this world would be better if I didn't even know they existed.
8861	1	a	Great! really fun game. Hard at first, you just have to get used to it. It's not a game for six year olds who can win without any effort.
8863	1	a	This is REALLY driving! Quite more difficult to control than other racing game but it is REALLY REAL!
8865	1	a	Racer check this out. The best racing sim at the moment!   Such an immersion gives you none! Sound, gfx and speeeed :D This is really an experience!  For some months i have turned my back and was in iRacing and Loeb Rally. Now after the last patch - 31/3/2016 - my racer heart is pumping stronger :D Nordschleife is out!  The new Nordschleife is a beauty and huuugggeee fun to race online with enough racers! - (btw I prefer online racing).  R3E gives you an amount of content, AI-racing is becoming better and better and you have the mp-part - which lacks of some features so far. With the AI you can race after the patch on SPA and Nordschleife with up to 100 racer grid. Starting from the back and fighting to the leader is fun sometimes for me. Lets hope for a bright online future ;D The multiplayer needs more online racer and more polish by the devs.  The controls are superb for me: In use is here a G27 with a Th8RS shifter and from time to time i like to race in the right sofa-mood with my xbox-controller in 'Sound'-view ;D   Try the free part and there is the possibility to try all cars on one track. Check it out! Absolute worth it!  For more infos visit the devs-forum:   https://forum.sector3studios.com/index.php?find-new/1901361/posts   Have fun!  Harryo  PS: Leave the FOV on 1.0 - real FOV cockpit view - and change the seat-position to your liking. You will have the best feeling so far your screen is big enough ;D   PPS: Just now the devs have released the Audi R18 :D i have to go! Cya on the track and drive with respect online!  Edit: 08/2016  Do you prefer online racing? Check Iracing: way better online system, bigger community and more more social racer.   R3E is for me now in between. Back to iracing for more multiplayer fun.
8867	1	a	I really enjoy playing this game. One of the best racing simulators I’ve ever played before in my life. Graphics great, even on mid-range PC, sounds are awesome, physics is so real. Even on beta stage, I am impressed about work has done.  This game pleases me so well everyday for two years.  I believe it will become much more filled by content in future.  Best regards, Yevgeny.
8869	1	a	the game is fun to play but has some controller issue were the car forces me to turn right even after i config the controls and for some odd reason when i download the game it's finding a virus and deletes it something to do with tracks file seem not to bypass it hope they clear it up soon could be my issue
8871	1	a	This game i think it is the best free racing game on steam BUT you have to have a pretty good computer or laptop if you want it to run above 30fps
8873	1	a	It was good before, but after the new company Sector 3 got in charge it`s becoming excellent. It`s a simulator not an arcade game.  Pros:  Graphics 9/10 Much Improved lately Physics 10/10 Sound 10/10 Gameplay 9/10  Cons:  No offline mode, even for single player you always have to connect to their servers. Their Servers have sometimes problems and you cannot play it till they manage to repair them.  Content prices are expensive. I bought most of the content on sales  I cannot comment on Mutiplayer as I use only Single Player but heard there are mostly fair players.

8879	1	a	After reading some bad comments, sure it can get expensive. But i've yet to spend a dime and the quality of physics detail seem good. The F F B is great compared to assetto corsa. no drifting at raceroom obviously, but a good race sim. Not sure what understeer I've hear someone say on youtube. Been fine for me. Haven't raced with and assists so can't comment about that. Wish full multiplayer without buying into a race season was an option. but eh the devs did a polished job. The ui isn't perfect but has really come a long way. UI was buggy but much better now
8881	1	a	Love the simulation and sounds!
8883	1	a	Enjoying this very much.  Tried this a while ago and went back to AC and PCars. Those two lost it some where in my opinion. Tried Raceroom again in November and my gosh what an improvement.  This is now my goto Simulator. FFB in my opinion is on par with the best and the sound....nothing else comes close.   Free content is limited but the ADAC GT3 and DTM packs are of high quality and worth every cent.
8885	1	a	it is a good game but disepointing that there are not so many free cars and tracs in the game
8887	1	a	Great game.   I've played Forza, GT...love GT6, but damn! Raceroom is fun. I bought the WTCC addon (but I love WTCC) and it's a blast to drive. The FWD physics is awesome...awesome = realistic durining corning and hard braking. Then I bought the GT3 addon (everything was bought during Xmas sales) and it was a blast, I still need traction control but perfection comes with time (plus i'm using the xbox controller). Buying some of the tracks is a bit lame, to be honest but that's how this developer pays their employees.   I use a 8 core AMD , 32 gbs o' ram with 2 gtx 760's...more than enough for this game. It runs AMAZING.   If you love racing give this a shot and get the some of the addons while their still on xmas discount.
8889	1	a	EDIT: Here's my video review of R3E after playing for a month:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91oxmTnvR1k   First, I'll address the nay-sayers problems with the 'pay wall': Go to the RaceRoom Shop (not the DLC Store) and purchase your vRP credits there. With $65 you can get 10000 vRP which is *much* cheaper than buying it in-game or using Steam Wallet and you'll be able to buy pretty much all the content in the DLC store. Next, wait for things that you want to go on sale. Test drive the cars that you want to buy in-game first to make sure you like them. Please note: you *do not* have to own all cars in a class to race against a full field. If you only like the Corvette Z06, then just buy the one or two liveries that you like and when you race against AI, you'll still see McLarens and Mercedes-Benzs out on track. I picked up the ADAC GT 2014, WTCC 2015, American Track Pack, and Audi Sport TT Cup 2015 (one livery) for $27. That's *very* reasonable for a dozen tracks and a dozen cars and a few dozen liveries.  Last note on the DLC: *do not* purchase the DLC through Steam as the discounts don't apply there.  Now, as far as the driving, the FFB is detailed and informative with many settings to adjust how much each effect is weighted in the steering. You can also define clutch bite point, clutch and brake sensitivity, dead zone, upper and lower limits, as well as tune the shifter debounce timeout - and many more options. The graphics are good and the sounds are great - you can tune how much suspension squeak, tire scrub, transmission whine, etc. The AI are generally pretty good and make for a lot of fun in tighter races. I haven't tried out the online functionality.  Aside from the Portimao circuit and Lakeview Hill Climb stage, all of the free content is pretty boring and doesn't do a great job of selling the sim's potential. The Audi Sport TT Cup 2015 car is what really sold me on the sim and with its push-to-pass 10-second boost system it makes for awesome racing.  The main downside to this sim is that it *requires* a 100% always-on internet connection to the Sector 3 servers, even for single player practice. If your internet goes down for a moment or you lose connection for an instant, you're immediately booted out of the game until your connection is satisfactory again. As of this time, there is no offline mode and even slight flutters in internet connection will cause issues. It appears to have something to do with the anti-cheat mechanism they use (there are regular tournaments with leaderboards and prizes, etc) as well as the content management system to make sure you're only using DLC that you own, coupled with the online stats profiling (it logs how many laps you've done in each car at each track, how long you've spent off-track, etc) and the online telemetry upload for replays and such. It's annoying if you don't have a stable internet connection, so keep that in mind.  The sim is quite good with lots of good quality content and highly polished FFB and sound effects. I'm playing with a TrackIR 5, Logitech G25, Renovatio SRD-9c dash, on Windows 10 Pro 64-bit (Core i7-6700, 16 GB DDR4, 512 GB M.2 SSD, GTX 970) on a 34' ultrawide (21:9) display at 3440x1440.
8891	1	a	WOW THIS GAME IS AMAGING GRAFICS ARE SO SO GOOD DOWNLOND THIS YOU WILL LOVE IT
8893	1	a	What i really not like in this game is dirt in tracks.So annoying The controls are pretty hard but you learn in time Good graphics Very Very good optimization 9/10
8895	1	a	The graphics are pretty good. I tried to set my controller up to the game and it decided to not let me drive. I ended up having to set all of the controls back up again but other then that Its a great game if you enjoy racing.
8897	1	a	There are some truly god aful reviews here. Not liking the game because you have to buy content is not a legitimate reason to leave a negative review. You have to buy everything these days and why is that different here? It's cost is comparative to any other title when yuo add a few content packs into play. Yes if you add them all you will spend more money then an entire game, you also end up with Laser Scanned tracks, some of the best driving physics a simulation has   Graphically the game is a little behind but it IMO actually does a great job at looking the most realistic and providing most realistic feel when racing. RF2 does an ok job here but being DX9 only is a hold back. AC is gorgeous but not real, Project Cars looks like a video game. PC looks the best, but also has the worst driving model and is not realistic in look at all.   If you enjoyed Race 07, GTR2, and GTR Evolution you will like RRE. To me this is the spiritual success of these titles and I will continue to support both Simbing/Sector3 and ISI and their Gmotor efforts. Ian and Project Cars well lets just say I have PCars but ill never buy it.
8899	1	a	For new players getting on steam and getting into racing games this is a good start. SO far ive had no problems with it and with my Intel core i7 and Nvidia GTX 560 it runs on Ultra graphics and is steady at 50 to 60 fps. The good thing about this game is that its free and when you get it and cant afford all the addons with new maps cars etc.. it has a good variety of starting cars and maps.  On a scale of 1 to 10.... id give it a 9.   I would totally recommend it to new racing players!! :)
8901	1	a	Play Simracing since GTR2, so i have a good overview about SImgames. Now we have some good Simracing games like Assetto Corsa and Iracing. The difference between this two games and RRRE is that the Forcefeedack are much more real then the other two games. Enginesound from all cars are more real and you think youre inside your dreamcar.   short pro and contra list:  +Engine Sound +ForceFeedback +collision detection (much much better then Assetto Corsa) +Racing Tracks (not all laserscanned but real similar to the real tracks) +Racecars (DTM13/14,WTCC13,GTR1/2/3/X,GTMasters,Daytona,Procars and much more) +OnTrack Settings like (control, HUD,Sound, etc.)I miss that in Assetto Corsa +dedicated server still in development (comming soon) +RealRace Drivers use this game to train (Sometimes you see one of your Racestar ingame) +everycar have a own setup what you can edit how you want - steering options for everycar +MP: Friends shown as a star in the Serverlist  -/+Microtransactions (You can buy a complete Pack like GTMasters or DTM 13/14. -/+Multiplayer in Alpha Stage (some stuff is missed) -just few onlineplayers -Multiplayer: Training/Qualitime: Players join during sessions, a join lag destroy your Laptime -Setupguide is missing (example. Assetto Corsa explain ingame what every option mean) -MP: Loadtime while joining a server take a long time (maybe 2-3 minutes)   Most stuff is in development and the devs are working hard.   I think that this game is one of the top sims actually,
8903	1	a	Cool Graphics
8905	1	a	try it.. if you like it you can buy cars and tracks the way you want :-)
8907	1	a	I'm not gonna write a review. Instead I'll ask for help. After last big patch, I was not able to start a game, so I decided to 'delette local content' and reinstall - BUT I NO LONGER HAVE IT IN MY STEAM GAME LIBRARY. !?!?! What to do? ( I bought a lot of cars and tracks...)
8909	1	a	Shound is awesome! But you wheelslip to easy tho...
8911	1	a	Can i yse my Genius Racing wheel on it?
8913	1	a	hi vary good game love it the only problum is that it keeps crashing on me auther than that a good game
8915	1	a	Yes, but its pay to play kind of game.
8917	1	a	Give it time ,its not easy very technical ,Once you get use to letting off the gas ,and that sometimes you must use your brakes its not bad , And remember your not going to win the race in the first corner ....
8919	1	a	Logged a dozen or so hours into this game so far and am really loving it. The graphics are great along with the handling and sounds. Very satisfying when you win a race. I highly recommend this game. The free tracks are some of the more pituresque of the bunch. You will love it!
8921	1	a	good game - too much DLC for too much money ;)
8923	1	a	fantastic - this game offers a full-blown simulation game for free ( yes ok the free content is not very much ), it has a very nice feel to the game when driving the cars over bupms and curbs, the way the cars can suddenly bite you in the ♥♥♥ when going around a corner is great fun - i cant say how real it is because ive never drove the road version of the cars let alone the racing counterparts! But it feel real to me, also the car sounds are amazing. My favorite of the cars is the classic touring cars. the other great thing is that you really can run this on a low end system because not only is there 15,000 quality settings to adust you can also set the amount of AI cars visible at once - i run at high to medium settings ( with expection to shadows which are off and refection quality, they kill my machine ) with 18 cars visible with a 750ti gpu and a AMD a6 duel core 4.4ghz cpu AND IT LOOKS AMAZING!!! the only bad thing is that most dlc can only be bought with the in game store ( uses your steam wallet ) and the prices are a bit steep if there not on offer.
8925	1	a	Great fun game. Only car handling a bit bad
8927	1	a	The only problem that I ran into was the massive p2w wall.
8929	1	a	I'm going with a 'yes' to 'do you recommend this game ?', but that 'yes' needs to be qualified. If you want an easy arcade style game, as a lot of the other reviews suggest to me, then move on, this isn't a game, it's a serious simulation. Like most serious simulations, you can't expect to get everything in one download. You buy the base and then you add the elements that interest you, just like people did with scalextric or electric train sets back in the good old days :) The advantage of this offering is that the first part is free. It doesn't include a lot, but if you have some patience, there is enough to get a feel for what is on offer and decide if you want more.  I have tried both Assetto Corsa and RaceRoom Experience this past week. My first impression was that Assetto Corsa was better. It cetainly has the better interface and the option to set up the cars to some degree is attractive. RR3 has some problems with it's server and the current Nvidia drivers, but, while frustrating, these are not major issues, assuming these will be fixed in the near futures. Both simulations promise multiplayer options, although it looks like the RR3 option will be limited to the DM Experience DLC for now. For me the availability of the DM Experience tips the odds in favour of RR3 for the moment, but I'm happy to follow both for now and see what the future brings.  One final word regarding control options. I haven't tried either simulation with a mouse/keyboard option and I don't think this would be much fun. A PC xbox 360 controller is what I am using at the moment and I find it adequate for the for the 'amateur', as opposed to 'novice' level of skill.     
8931	1	a	Really good simulator. Graphics are great!
8933	1	a	Its free so don't complain, its decent but not sure about purchasing and DLC Project Cars is more for the DLC
8935	1	a	good game and it's in multiplayer :3
8937	1	a	there's a great game here plays just like the old gtr games, unfortunately it cost's just that bit too much to actually buy it. Especially as alot of the packs overlap content which means you either virtually pay for some stuff twice or buy it all seperately for a bigger price overall. such a shame.
8939	1	a	Every car skids like it's on ice   10/10 would crash again
8941	1	a	First of all i want you to know that ive tried every other Sim out there, Iracing, Rfactor 1/2, AC, GSC and other older titles.  This for me right now is the most promising sim out there, the packs it has are really good, DTM, WTCC, ADAC, DTM 92, Group 5 cars.. awesome. I would say the content they have is only rivaled by iRacing.. however this sim is a whole lot cheaper.  The physics are very good, the graphics are some of the best (forget Pcars, that is not a sim) and the sound and immersion are THE BEST.. there is a truly great comunication with the developers and the content/updates are coming out at a great pace.  Try it out.   
8943	1	a	This game is awesome, if a little expensive!
8945	1	a	Good game a few bug to start with but sorted them out
8947	1	a	its a very good high quality racing game and its free
8949	1	a	The best SIM i played so far. pretty realistic. Awesome graphics.
8951	1	a	Great game if you like to race
8953	1	a	Very good game with amazing sounds and physics (Y)
8955	1	a	Speed as lightning.
8957	1	a	Cars
764	0	a	At this time I cant recommend this, the game dose look good and plays well, Its beta like in ways, buggy poor menu system, the updates fix one problem and make three more. Time to delete try agin next year.
8959	1	a	Vroom Vroom. Such Wow. Much Real.
8961	1	a	Raceroom is a great racing simulator. It has good physics and graphics, and AMAZING sounds. Simbin has done a great job capturing the feel. Now, the downside I'm goign to point out is that this is not entirely free to play. It is essentially a base game with a couple cars and tracks. Extra tracks and cars must be bought. Raceroom is constantly being updated with new content, if you want to buy stuff wait until it goes on sale. Everything eventually will go on sale for at least %50 off. If you ever need any input the raceroom discussion board is a great place as well.   ==In Short==: Awesome Racing Sim, but Not Truly FTP. 
765	0	a	Pros:  + Incredible graphics + It's free!  Cons:  - Needs multiplayer - Very complicated interface/menu (I still don't know how to win cups)  Conclusion:  RaceRoom's graphics are excellent (one of the best ones I've seen), but these incredible graphics are wasted on a pointless game! I have no idea how to REALLY play it! When I click 'Drive', it takes me to a track, but there are no opponents, and when I finish a lap it lets me do it again! (there's no end to it! It's an infine loop!) After a lap all it says is 'New record time' or nothing...  Score: 2/10
766	0	a	Awful physics and expensive content. Shame, as I loved 07 but Simbin have nosedived with this. If you can spend the money go with iRacing, if not, try Assetto Corsa (sp?). Actually, get both and save yourself the download on this 'high end' sim. Physics... well, they may seem good if you have never driven a car. Only positives I can find is the sound is pretty good, gfx passable as long as you don't use triple screens and it is free to try so I didn't waste any money on it.
8963	1	a	Very Cool Raceing game with online multiplayer.... And ... Take your sits please...... ITS FREEEEEEEEEEEEE :D
8965	1	a	best racing game i played on steam so far! im impressed
8967	1	a	This game looks awesome and its free. Free is never truly free, but that is the marketing model.  This game will continue to develope for years to come. This game has come a long way since 2009. Thats right, 2009. its been reworked alot of times, and its always getting better.   This is one of the most fair free to play models in the market. Each track takes hundreds of hours of work. Some of the newer tracks have the cost of laser scanning on top of the time to write it.   Nearly every game out today sells dlc. This base game is free. You $40 to $60 ahead just for trying it. If you like it, then get what you like. If not, at least you did not blow $40 to $60 for a game you only play once in a while.     The cars that come with the game are good enough to get a feel for the game, but if you like the game your gonna need to buy the tracks and cars you want. There are packs available to save you some money. You will probably spend $60 to $80 for the content you want if you like the game. All the content is about $250 or so.  I used this on my Fanatec Wheel, and my x360 controller, both play well.  At this current time most of what this game has to offer surpasses every other sim I have played including A/C. When A/C first came out, it had this beat. Now with a few updates later, it is better both graphically and in terms of physics.  I only wish the game had Daytona Road Course.  I have been a supporter of this game long before it was ported to steam. About 2009 or so. This game really does continue to get developed.
8969	1	a	this simulator has been reborn due to care and attention to driving, and if you have a decent wheel and pedal + hshifter and race on the hilclimb with BMW M1 Procar you will insta fall inlove with it. it is the only sim that has understood chicane and hilclimb driving. it has gained my full respect as of the day the released hilclimb with BMW M5 and M1 Procar / I started playing it 100% since and I have stopped playing other similar sims.. try it only with a wheel and pedals and with forcefeedback and on hilclimb with M1 or M5!!! my old rating was 7/10 and now due to this event it has gaine clean 10/10!!!
8971	1	a	This game is a good start to driving sims. If you picked up your brand new 900-1080 degree FFB wheel and you got no money left over, look no further than this gem. The physics are on par with the lazer scaned iracing, and super car fun fest Asseto Corrsa. The begining cars and tracks are fun to learn, and really give you a sense of joy when shaving off 1/4 a second of a hotlap all while realizing how this is meaningless. There are 3 main modes of difficulty: Novice- Babies first racing sim, Amateur- X360 gamepad user, and Get Real- Why am I backwards and why is my front end smashed in? The only complaint is that the DLC is not only hard on the conusmer, it makes finding servers a living hell. The full experiece will cost you upwards of $100 and it is hard to justify that when other games cost around $50 and have the same content.
8973	1	a	A really decent sim racer that motivates you to keep on going!
8975	1	a	Racing against the AI works, only with minor behavior issues. Supports large range of controlers and the sounds are insanely well done.  Good track models (above F1 games by codemasters quality at least) and cars.  Functional in game store with steam works integraded with your steam wallet.  Took me a while to find a recent sim that make good races along with game stock car extreme.
8977	1	a	This is the best sim since Grand Prix Legends. Simply the most fun you can have with your clothes on. Period. If you love race cars &amp; racing this is as close as you can get to the real thing. They even give you a couple of tracks &amp; 3 cars for free, Whats to complain about. Yes Multiplayer is in alpha. So if you do that then you can expect problems. But the single player game is great against the ai. Works fine &amp; is stable on my Pc. Try it. You won't be disapointed. But as said by others. Buy your upgrades direct from the games website. Not through Steam. You can purchace from your steam wallet. It's not perfect yet there still working on it. But it is good.... Very good! Bought some tracks including one I've actually driven on &amp; it's spot on. When you crash it doesn't even cost you anything!!!! Hell I love this game already &amp; I only had it a few days! Works well with a joystick. So you don't have to spend a fortune on a wheel. Now I've got the thing calibrated good bye life...... :-)  Sure if your looking for arcade forget it. You will hate it. Go and waste your money on something else. Bore your brains out after 15 hours. This will take you that long to get into it. Trust me I'm only just starting. This can only get better, With more tracks coming online all the time it will be alot better. And when they sort the multiplayer........... Bought 7 tracks &amp; 20 cars for £20 so don't believe the doom merchants. Much cheaper from the games website than on steam, This is one game I don't mind paying for DLC''s as it will keep the game in developement. Real world physics. Awesome sound that deserves some decent speakers. And after all they give you so much for free. How you can whinge about that. If it doesn't work on your system then at least it hasn't cost you anything. I have paid good money for other race games that won't even run on my Pc or have no controller support. This game is quality.
8979	1	a	great racing sim. wide selection of detailed cars/classes and courses that are updated quite frequently. offciall DTM, WTCC, ADAC series, with all cars, liveries and tracks. amazing sound. FFB is great, strong, detailed and realistic. the settings are not too complicated to adjust to personal taste. people complain about it being not being free...of course it isn't, but you pay for what you are interested in, and there are always things on sale.  overall, one of my favorite sims. the devs are always improving it and adding new content.
8981	1	a	fUN gAME STILL NEEDS SOME WORK STILL DONE STILL MISSING A COUPLE GOOD TRACKS BUT OVERALL 7.5/10
8983	1	a	8/10 for a beta its OK but I really hope to get more tracks soon. and more cars....   loads of fun for a noob like me . the hill climbs are relaxing . the UI is good . could use some hover tool tips over the more advanced settings .   
8985	1	a	I got this because i wanted better sports games. Takes alot to run but not bad for a free to play game
8987	1	a	Superb racing sim,,,,,,,,,,,,11\10......nuff said. JUST TRY IT FOR YOURSELF.
8989	1	a	If you are a petrolhead, you'd love this. This is on an AAA class level in every aspect. Just try it out!
8991	1	a	it doesnt let me login half the time, i have to keep going to the website to fix it, its annoying
8993	1	a	Let me start off by saying this is an incredible game. There's lots of content and the game is growing bigger step by step. I'm going to dive into some subjects a lot of negative reviews talk about and try and explain my viewpoint on them.    Multiplayer    The multiplayer is currently still developping. There are dedicated servers, and you can create your own lobbies. Multiplayer at the moment isn't very crowded, however you can have some good and fun races.    Payment model    Contrary to the Free to Play tag this game isn't free to play. A better tag would be Free Demo, but it seems this can't be helped. I'm going to compare the game with league of legends, because it's a well known free to play game. In league of legends you earn in game currency for playing, and that currency can be used to buy things. Next to the ingame currency there is a currency buyable with irl money. In RaceRoom, there is no ingame currency, just vRP, which can be bought for irl money. That's also why I don't think the Free to Play tag applies.  Now on to the paymeny model. Paying 50€ upfront for a game and unlocking all the content is very nice, but there will most likely be content you don't like or feel like playing. In RaceRoom, tracks, cars, trackpacks and carpacks can be bought seperately. Say you don't like DTM, but do like GT2, then you can just buy the GT2 cars. One thing to note is that if you want all the items, you'll be looking at a price quite a bit higher than 50€. But to put his into perspective, in league of legends you pay +- 10€ for a champion, in RaceRoom you pay +- 2.5 euro for a car.  I should also note that content can be tested for free, so you have an idea whether or not you like it.    Interface    The interface has been upadtes, is new easy to navigate and comprehend, but you still need a mouse to be able to quickly navigate menu's    Some personal insight   I do believe you need a wheel to play this game. You can you a gamepad, but then you're just not getting the complete experience.   The sounds in the game are incredible, especially with the new transmission sound update.  Graphics are great and the game runs on older hardware however there is only Dx9 support if I'm not mistaken.   As an ending I'd say, try the game out, test drive some cars, and if you like it buy some cars you enjoy driving. 
8995	1	a	Very cool racing game! On the single player mode you can practice your for bots on the multiplayer mode and you can chase your friends. A game for those who do not want to spend money on games such. Need For Speed (In this case Shift). We have to pay for skins for cars, including maps because they are not all free. A nice little game I recommend :) 
8997	1	a	READ THIS. Before you download this 15gb game consider this: Do you like Quantity, or Quality? Quality? RaceRoom Racing Experience (R3E). Newer, better native support. If you play it though, expect having to dish out the dough for getting a amazing experience. $40 dollars can get you (if stuff is on sale, which is regularly is) 10-15 tracks, and 5-10 cars, some in 'packs.' The physics is great, the controls are amazing (I'm on a XBOX 360 controller), and the game just feels perfect. Personally I love the competitions of where its just you and the track and you try to get the best time out of EVERYONE. But you have to pay for everything. -vs- Quantity? Race07. Older game, but still holds up to date, if you want this game, get the SimBin Mega Bundle (same $40 dollars!) and get all the DLC and its 15$ less then buying all of them alone. The game has it's quirks and could have been better but is still an amazing racing game none-the-less. But it has loads and I mean LOADS of tracks and a nice array of cars.  You choose, and don't go hating on this game. It's certainly a different approach to paying into a game, but it is OK SimBin, OK.
8999	1	a	stunning graphics 
9001	1	a	The handalling of the cars isnt as good as iRacing, but the selection of cars is amusing.   The fun of the game is all the time trial comps through-out the year.   Good Game 7/10
9003	1	a	its a really good game but i do not recommend to play it on a keyboard .
9005	1	a	I stopped played it after couples minutes since I don't like the way to handle the car. It's too stiff, and once I done a wrong control I have to restart the race instead getting back to drive. A car selection is also very limited (without spending money like buy a pack, of course). But it has a good graphic, and the game it self have a potential.  6/10 for me.
9007	1	a	First of all I'm a big racing sim nut, I dont go for those other titles like need for speed, get a console if you like those games. Over all I like this game, its very easy to pick up, very good graphics and physics, and enjoyable, I only have the DTM add on so far and am enjoying it greatly, I've tried playing with both gamepad and steering wheel and the enjoyment is there for both. what I dont like is the amount of DLC's you end up paying for, I really wish the games industry would migrate away from this, unfortunately this game is by far the worst I have in my steam account for this, and the main reason I havent bought more packs. overall yes its a good game, the multiplayer states its still in alpha, so there are better games out there, personally iracing does what this lacks very well. as for Ai, I hate to say it but Project cars probably has the best AI I have come across in a modern racing game. For those who havent got this game yet, should you get it? yes, but choose a DLC pack that you will like and stick with, dont go crazy buying all the packs.
9009	1	a	some prototypes and cars + algarve race circuit and one fictional raceway for free.
9011	1	a	Lots of potential!
9013	1	a	It's a really good racing simulator. The graphics are not overwhelming but good. Unfortunatley you really need a steering wheel to be able to fully enjoy it.
9015	1	a	***EDIT-2015*** If you had told me at the time I first wrote this review that things were just about to turn around and that this would become one of my favorite games of 2015 (and hopefully later) I would have had you committed.  But that's exctly what happened. Big shake ups went on at Simbin and the company is now called 'Sector 3'. But more than that, whoever it was that made the majority of the wrong decisions about this game must either be gone or he/she has seen the light.  I have changed my review to reflect the great advances this game made. I will also write a more comprehensive review at some point in the future, but for now suffice to say that this game should be in every race enthusiast library.  -------------------OLD REVIEW BELOW-------------------------------    It pains me not to reccomend this game. I own every single Simbin game ever published and I still race in a GTR2 league with weekly races where we manage to have 30 to 40 rivers per 1h or 1:30 hour race. Every week, year around.  Naturally, GTR2 is showing its age, but it is still the only racing simulator with day/night transitions, full pit experience, large fields and all the other features that make a simulator awesome.  We waited for GTR3 for a long time and we were very excited by Simbin early previews of their new sound engine. It was truly something to behold. Then GTR3 fizzled and Raceroom Racing Experience came out as a 'free to play' game. Initially I was quite impressed. The sound was awesome and far superior to anything else out there. The graphics, while not the best, were better than their latest offering (the Race07 series). The car handling was OK. Nothing too advanced, but passable.  Even as a free to play game it had promise and initially we belived it would become something at least playable if not a substiotute for GTR2.  After the launch, which only included hotlapping as an activity and an 'Apex hunt' game that, while a good training tool, seemed forced and certainly no substitute for the missing features. However, since it was a new game I even purchased about $70 of content, betting on the upcoming and promised availability of AI cars and multiplayer.   While we knew that as a league we would be looking elsewhere for our future platform, R3 held the promise of being a good offering for casiual online racing.  Then time passed and the only new offerings were cars, tracks and ugly, useless 'liveries'. The promised AI is still (as of this writing) missing in action and there is no multiplayer to speak of, just boards with hot lapping results.  The choice of available cars goes from the uninspired (cars that every sim seems to have) to some unique cars that are indeed exciting, except that they all seem to drive like one another.  Frankly, if I could go back in time I would buy only the Zacspeed Ford and the additional hillclimb track. The free cars are OK, with the BMW hillclimb car being the best of the lot and the hillclimb challenge is really the only bright spot in this game. Considering that the BMW and the hillclimb are free, I would suggest thst if you like the genre you download this game, but don;t buy anything else. Maybe the other hillclimb track and a car or two that you fancy. All the rest is just repetitive and uninteresting.  There is no weatehr, no day/night transitions, no pit stops, no telemetry to speak of, even the liveries, which are not free and there is no way to design your own, are ugly.   To me it is truly unbelievable that a company like simbin released this stillborn game. It could have been so much more, but in truth, they fooled me into spending more than double what I ever paid for GTR2 so maybe they made their money from me for the next two years. But no more. They released a DTM game that suffers from the same limitations (it has AI, but it is very weak) and for the first time since I ahve been simracing I did not buy it.  Maybe one day they will come to their senses and they will offer the same features as GTR2 offered almost 10 years ago. Maybe they'll relent anmd let players create their own liveries and the promised 'Adaptive' AI will really be what they promised. Maybe one day you'll be able to compete against other humans online too, and maybe even at night and in the rain. Maybe.  When that happens, buy this game. Until then, perfect your hillclimb skills (that is really a lot of fun) and save your money.
9017	1	a	love it. great game with logitec driving force gt wheel, kept me quiet while doing hill climbing at 120mph
9019	1	a	awesome i love it XD
9021	1	a	One of the best racing simulator i have ever played. Decent graphics and best sound quality. The downside is that it only gives you few cars and tracks and most cars and tracks you need to buy :( but atleast you can test drive the cars :)
9023	1	a	i have a question. why server maintenance
9025	1	a	Not going to write a lenghty review, but to the people who are saying the business model is 'bad' are wrong. It is what I would call flexible. Sure, there isn't much base content, and I think Sector3 Studios should offer another car and track combo to really get a feel for what this game has to offer.  The cars are relatively cheap (can be even cheaper if bought in packs) and are all quality-made. Same goes for the tracks, minus a few inaccuracies here and there. Most notably is track elevation, this game does not seem to create the feeling of elevation too well when compared with other sims such as rFactor, Assetto Corsa and of course iRacing.  You are not forced to pay hundreds of dollars, you can simply do as I have done and buy 6-8 cars and a few tracks. That's it. I will be entertained for a few weeks with just this little bit of content as I practice to get the most out of each car and track I drive.  Thank you for taking the time to read the short review!
9027	1	a	4 cars for free, 46 cars dlc 1337/420 IGN
9029	1	a	Among with the best (with Assetto Corsa) racing Sim ever !
9031	1	a	A glimpse into what SimBin is bringing in the future. Excellent. Cannot wait to see more.
9033	1	a	u need Vista or more!!! XDDDD
9035	1	a	Not for the faint-hearted. A real driving simulator, unlike the arcade-style garbage saturating the games market. Only 2 tracks &amp; 5 cars in Free2Play mode but has replayability in that you are positioned on the real-time leaderboards. Definately a AAA title.
9037	1	a	If you are into simulation racing, you should try this game. It can be a little hard to get used to, but is very good when get the hang of it.
9039	1	a	Hey everyone,  RRRE is worth your time.  RRRE is a absolute hidden treasure of a racing sim buried under a unattractive business model and hidden behind terrible loading menus. (i believe soon to be fixed) Dig beyond, and you will be rewarded, handling, dynamics, visuals, sound. It has it all. Its also beautifully optimized and can run well (and still look great) on older rigs, but when you have the horsepower crank it up for amazing visuals. This game has continually gotten better and better as the SIMBIN team from the great Race07 continue to work and improve this absolute driving masterpiece.  Do yourself a favour pic up Hockenheim in sunset with some gt3's and just sit back and enjoy.  dig.
9041	1	a	A very good free to play racing game that could be a bit better in control. What it lacks in fluid controls though is forgiven for its great amount of detail that SimBin put into the environments and cars. The biggest problem though is that you must be online at all times and only about three to four cars and courses are available to you right away. The other cars and courses must be bought in order to use them. Other than that this game is a great download for those who enjoy games like Gran Turismo or Forza Motorsport.
9043	1	a	+++++
9045	1	a	It's a great tutorial on how to use micro-transactions!
9047	1	a	coolest race game ive ever played 
9049	1	a	how u play it?
9051	1	a	Nice game and stunning detail for a free game! My handling seems screwed up, though.
9053	1	a	I'm a fan of car games for many years and I think this is the best racing game on the market today. It's a bit time-consuming development, and a bit expensive but I think worth every penny. The physics are excellent, very accurate! Have a mode get real with 6 levels of traction control and full adjustment of the car and the tracks area awesome, very similar to the real thing. A good wheel is needed as well.
9055	1	a	Controls are a bit buggy, lags a lot, even on lowest graphical settings
9057	1	a	It's a bucket load of fun! I seriously recomend this game
9059	1	a	I recommend this game to peolpe who have fast and good computers, and who are able to get round tricky controles.
9061	1	a	one of the best sims ever if you want arcade racing go somewhere else this is for the purist of drivers very hard to master but hour and hours of fun highly recomend if you want pure racing
9063	1	a	Awsome sounds, content you can try for free, competitions with prizes and some awsome jump in and play online racing. Check it out if you like racing !
9065	1	a	Cars feel good, and when playing with a controller it's as good as Forza.
9067	1	a	This is free, but not so great.
9069	1	a	Good graphics, feels like most racing games that I've played but the so far worst thing about it that I've noticed is extremely bad control, first car and so far the only car I drove you esentially had to stop the car to turn the thing and the game is so ridged when it comes to completing laps that if you over stear or under stear and you will you lap is totally wasted because you have to back up and do over where ever you messed up if you can figure out where and I wouldnt have so big of a problem with it.... if they let you change cars and if they do I have no idea how and probably wont for the next year cause there is no tips or tutorials for beginners in the game at all so if you're new to racing games do not and I stress this DO NOT download this game cause its ment for people that actually are able to understand what the hell they were thinking when this game was designed and honestly I get better control from talking to a snail so ask please actually write a tutorial for this game for those that dont have the most expensive racing simulator setup ever created.
9071	1	a	I think this game is one to watch. It really is a very high quality racing simulator especially considering it is free. A little too far down the realism spectrum for my liking though. The main problem is that there is no sense of accomplishment or incentive to keep playing. In most racing games you win races to unlock new tracks and cars which keeps you wanting to play on. But here you unlock new stuff by buying it. Also the races them self are just against the clock. There is very little sense of accomplishment from just moving a few places up the leader boards. So as I say I think this is one to keep an eye on as more content become available.
9073	1	a	controles unresponsive, only class of vehicles for starting out are too powerful for the track. impossible to play from the start up. as a fan of racing games i am severly disapointed
9075	1	a	i havent played this XD
9077	1	a	this game is actually kinda fun
9079	1	a	absolutly hopeless  i had high hopes for the game it looks brilliant but THE LOGIN ISNT WORKING I HAVE REGESTERED IVE CHECKED MY THINGS BUT ITS SAYING ERROR  PLEASE SORT THIS OUT
9081	1	a	hey its free
9083	1	a	its fun, so try it!
9085	1	a	Cars are cool
9087	1	a	Way too difficult to get going. Not worth the donwload in my opinion
9089	1	a	A steering wheel would definately complete it, but overall fun. Not fantastic just fun.
9091	1	a	I've reconsidered my previous, extremely negative review.  The last update for this sim has helped things quite dramatically.  After playing for a couple of hours I experienced no crashes to desktop at all and the steering feels considerably better, almost perfect now on my Fanatec CSR Elite wheel.    Swapping from my single 2560 x 1440 monitor my old tripple screen 5760 x 1200 NVida Surround setup helps make the sim more addictive.  I've always liked the quality of the SimBin tracks as they're full of detail which further adds to the sense of immersion.  Despite the relatively high cost if you puchase all the tracks and get a good collection of cars, I think you'd find that this will give you hundreds of hours of entertainment.
9093	1	a	this is a epic and i mean. EPIC!!!!! GAME CUZ U CAN JUST RACE AROUND THE TRACK AND HAVE FUN RACING!!!! AND ITS FREE!
9095	1	a	Really slick simulator, nice graphics, accurate physics. + it has some FREE content: 2 tracks and several cars. I don't see why anyone would not try it for free, and buy extra content if they so desire after ;)
9097	1	a	You will be a better driver in RL if you play this!
9099	1	a	this game is a waiste of time
9101	1	a	This game is a free-game which is really interesting, and nice physics of driving, but you need to give money to earn new cars and that sucks hard. Fun for a little ride, but i dont think it'll last long.
9103	1	a	graphically the best iv'e ever seen, driving feels awsome some people say its a little arcadey but feels real enough for me and the sounds are pretty amazing! cost, well...sucks a big one im tired of so called free to play(pay to play) these were called demos back in the day. people everywhere are taking advantage of this gimmic. pay should be optional for those that 1 have the money 2 cant wait or 3 suck at gaming and will otherwise not experience the full game, and should not be a requirement. to me thats gonna be the death for many games and maybe this one as well, and this game is looking real good. it cost 3 times as much to own all the content right now than to own a full game with ten times as much content...no thanks i would have really enjoyed this game but am stuck with whatever is free. guess this game is for enthusiests and the rich oh well on to the next. i do recomend it if you can afford it or want to try the 'demo'   after totaling up the cost, i just spent it on early access of AC hope its good   ps: if using a wheel make sure its set to 900 degrees a must or sucks. tip logitech pro ulocks with select r3 and right shift button at the same time
9105	1	a	im getting an error report when i attempt to log in any ideas,?
9107	1	a	Its quiite good if u want a racing game because its free but its really hard to stear with arrow keys i think it would be alot easier with a joystick
9109	1	a	Good Racer Game
9111	1	a	Best physics engine and driving model on the market, full stop. For players that want an accurate driving simulator and nothing else. Plenty of free content and enthusiasts will end up splurging some cash on cars and tracks.
9113	1	a	Good game, but have bad physics for keyboard.
9115	1	a	A great gateway game into SimRacing, whilst not as realistic as iRacing as far as car handling goes, content, graphics, sounds and general game direction make this a great pickup, it's free!  
9117	1	a	Very good game but a bit hard to control!
9119	1	a	Pretty good race sim, especially considering it is a free-to-play. The only problem is the framerate can drop on slightly lower powered machines like mine and the purchasing of extra cars/tracks you want can get expensive.
9121	1	a	Its a decent enough racing sim, only problem with the free to play games is the content that you have to buy in game so that you can at least compete to a competant level,  cashcow, thats what i would say this game is to the developers simbin, i havent really played that much to be honest as the car you start off with and subsequnt others that YOU will have to buy to be able to compete, is overall what put me off the game, Either way you look at it, it is a good sim for the racing fanatics out there, just not enough for me IMO, Overall : 7.00/10.00  was an 8.00, but down marked due to lack of cars at start, and having to buy them to get anywhere decent within the game, One thing i will note is that this game has a huge online community and friendly one too, so any body reading my review,  the ball,  as they say,  is in your court now. Cheers mark117h
9123	1	a	I love this kind of gaming play I wish there was more of this kind of games No more shooter games that is what is wrong with this world today
9125	1	a	Why i dont see the others car ?
9127	1	a	Good game, but have bad physics for keyboard.
9129	1	a	the game is smooth and the graphics are great on my pc
9131	1	a	this is a good game one thang tho out of the box you cant race a pack of cars its just you and the clock unless im doing somethang rong other than that it looks awsome drive good to
9133	1	a	!!!
9135	1	a	its fun as poop 
9137	1	a	Great For Uninstall
9139	1	a	this is a good game one thang tho out of the box you cant race a pack of cars its just you and the clock unless im doing somethang rong other than that it looks awsome drive good to
9141	1	a	!!!
9143	1	a	its fun as poop 
9145	1	a	Great For Uninstall
9147	1	a	guy is there a cB MODE IN THE GAME?
9149	1	a	This is an awsome game.
9151	1	a	I found my love in it.
9153	1	a	I laugh at people complaining about poor optimisation. I run this on an i7 2600k with 16GB DDR3 1600Mhz RAM and 2 780ti gpu in sli at 3440 x 1440 with 20 to 30 cars on grid and average 60 to 80 fps with graphics on max on windows 10.  The game itself is ok and can be fun, granted the handling is average but it is fun. By no means is it a sim, thats another discussion, but if you enjoy driving and have a wheel or controller (the game is controller friendly) then you will enjoy this. Only issue is the dlc but if your sensible and wait for dlc sale in the in game store, you can pickup content as you go for a reasonable price.  RRE isnt my go to driivng game, but it is good enough that I do keep coming back to it.
9155	1	a	worth the download and has great racecars but go in knowing you will have to buy something but i recomend it for sure
9157	1	a	Recommended!
9159	1	a	♥♥♥♥ me this game is awsome
9161	1	a	i dont have the game yet, but i love it. the textures are so creamy and rich.
9163	1	a	guy is there a cB MODE IN THE GAME?
9165	1	a	Try if you like racing
9167	1	a	The game is amazing and fun. the down side is the aids of the gaming world microtransactions. if the price for aditional tracks were from $0.99 to $1.50 then i would recomend but the prices are to high for me.
9169	1	a	There seems to be a lot of negative reviews on Steam about this game, especially revolving around the pricing structure, and while I agree that the price looks quite high I have to say that I think the items are so good that to me they're worth the outlay. You get what you pay for and the quality here outshines any misgivings regarding prices.  Graphically it's stunning especially with everything turned high and running at 60fps with 22 cars on the track, for which I'm referring to DTM experience, but the hot lapping in the base game with Ai turned on gives you an insight into what the finished game will feel like and in my opinion they have got it spot on.  I can only assume that the base game is yet to be optimised because I get lower FPS on the same tracks, with only a couple of cars out than I do with the 22 cars in a full race of DTM. Same graphics settings for both but with a 10 fps drop in the base game? Sounds are incredible, I've never been so engrossed in the sounds of any game as this one and playing with headphones on just highlights the beauty of these cars. Gameplay is great especially on the Get Real setting, althought the Ai needs a little bit more speed as its currently too easy to catch and overtake. I'm currently using a Razer Sabertooth gamepad and once setup it works perfectly but I can only imagine how much more fun a steering wheel would make this and it's the game which will likely push me to make that commitment.  It's that good that I've bought pretty much most of the buyable stuff, except for a couple of livery options, within just a few days of trying it.  EDIT : May 26th 2016  After having set myself up with some decent hardware to get the most out of driving games I can say that this is my favourite driving experience on the PC. I own most if not all of the PC racing sims but there's something about Raceroom that makes it very special to me, and that's the feeling you get from the overall atmosphere that this sim creates. From the sounds to graphics to driving feel, once set up correctly this is such a cool experience with AI that can keep up and give you a thrilling racing experience.
9171	1	a	Amazing quality and realism for a free game. You only get a few tracks and a few cars though.
9173	1	a	Bottom line here , Good game , cars , tracks , sound all good , its a sim not arcade type racer , yes you need to buy the tracks and cars you want to race , Yes people moan about paying for the cars and track here is my point of view. Other games your pay 'x' amount for the base game , then pay normally more for the DLC's that follow , Here you are getting the base game , you get a few cars and tracks all for free , you can practise on those to get a feel for things , Go test drive the different disiplines and decide which disiplline you would like to follow as a carreer , then go ahead and purchase that disiplin and track pack for the chosen disiplin , my point is you do not need to choose all the disiplines and tracks unless you want to race in all ,  For me Race room is not a 'ooohhhhhh collect all cars and tracks' type game its a sim and carreer game a game where you follow a specific disipline and go from there be the best you can be in chosing race career ,  so when you get down to it , you get a game 'Simulater' that you can get good at then purchase what you want to , you have choice , becuase there are plenty drivers in each disipline , you dont have to pay for a game then pay the same price and more again for the DLC collection , you pay for what you want and its cheaper then the 'Buy Game , Buy dlc , buy dlc buy dlc , and ,,,,,,,,' you get the picture , buy the car you want in the disipline not need for the whole car pack and the tracks for the chosine disipline ,,,,,,,, we have a game 'SIM' that you can choose what you want to do , other games ulimatley you will buy the game and all the dlc , why ? becuase all your buddy's have and you need the same to play with them , here you and your buddy's will no dought get only what you all are good at ,  Bottom line good game , and ultimatly one of the best sims ever even with the buy in for what you want to do , choice good stuff Simbin good stuff.  Yes I know my spelling sucks, a floor of mine , i am working on it.... 
9175	1	a	Try if you like racing
9177	1	a	best racing game i played on steam so far! im impressed
9179	1	a	The game is amazing and fun. the down side is the aids of the gaming world microtransactions. if the price for aditional tracks were from $0.99 to $1.50 then i would recomend but the prices are to high for me.
9181	1	a	this is a great game for a good racing experiance :)
9183	1	a	I must say,...RaceRoom Racing Experience, is the best Road Racing Simulation I have used to date!!!  Hats off to All Engineers involved in this product.  Cheers, Michael Giles Tomah, Wisconsin U.S.
9185	1	a	This game looks awesome and its free. Free is never truly free, but that is the marketing model.  This game will continue to develope for years to come. This game has come a long way since 2009. Thats right, 2009. its been reworked alot of times, and its always getting better.   This is one of the most fair free to play models in the market. Each track takes hundreds of hours of work. Some of the newer tracks have the cost of laser scanning on top of the time to write it.   Nearly every game out today sells dlc. This base game is free. You $40 to $60 ahead just for trying it. If you like it, then get what you like. If not, at least you did not blow $40 to $60 for a game you only play once in a while.     The cars that come with the game are good enough to get a feel for the game, but if you like the game your gonna need to buy the tracks and cars you want. There are packs available to save you some money. You will probably spend $60 to $80 for the content you want if you like the game. All the content is about $250 or so.  I used this on my Fanatec Wheel, and my x360 controller, both play well.  At this current time most of what this game has to offer surpasses every other sim I have played including A/C. When A/C first came out, it had this beat. Now with a few updates later, it is better both graphically and in terms of physics.  I only wish the game had Daytona Road Course.  I have been a supporter of this game long before it was ported to steam. About 2009 or so. This game really does continue to get developed.
9187	1	a	This has got to be the most underrated racing game or simulation. It may not have the best visuals among racing games right now but it still looks really good. It's FFB even though not revolutionary is something that you can tweak to suit your preferences and it's fantastic when you do.  Its problem is its annoying 'race2play' (a play on 'free 2 play') UI and it also only has a very few free cars and even fewer free tracks. I bought its GT Masters and DTM 2014 experiences and, man, those are fantastic. They should make separate games for those (but give it free to us who bought them here in RRE). Or at least let us configure the game to select a default 'experience' during startup.  AI in this game seems good. They don't display the 'blind AI' or 'AI without the I for intelligence' of other racing games and simulations.  Currently this game is still missing some polish on the HUD elements. Like the sector split times really huge and distracting when we only need to know if we're going faster or slower for the current lap. The position bar's fonts look horrible. Those things are really well done on their older games (Race series) so I hope they could really improve this area of the game. Currently those look ugly in comparison to the rest of the game that I turn them off at the expense of feedback since the game does not have a race engineer to tell you what's going on.
9189	1	a	This is probably the most imersive DTM experience any game can offer. The graphics are wonderful, the car feel so great, you actually have to sweat to keep it on the track. 10/10
9191	1	a	I won't give it a bad review, but you pretty much need a wheel and pedals to enjoy this game. Xbox controller is no bueno.  Tried it out on a weekend where everything is unlocked, but normally it appears that you would have to pay for most of the stuff (which is fine, if you like the game, then buy the content). It does appear to be pretty pricey if you buy everything though, even multiple or all the packs.
767	0	a	Finally! A replacement for GTR2. This game is way better handling than other current rivals and force feedback is great out of the box. No need for endless tuning. Great racing experience. This game is worth it even though you have to purchase cars and tracks. BUT, and this is a big one, I always struggle to login to the server and this is a problem many people have, so much so that I sometimes give up and don't even play this game. The loading times are also just painful. Such a ptiy because the racing and the physics in this game are great.
9193	1	a	Great game, cant wait for multiplayer
9195	1	a	2nd best only to Assetto Corsa, Recommended,
9197	1	a	When you need something to replace your missing GRID disk then download this, play 2 min, uninstall, wait 2 years and get an email worth of 5 eur of in-game credits that you instantly use
9199	1	a	RaceRoom is a very good game. I've really enjoyed the hours I have spent on it so far.  This is the short version of the review: Pros  +The sounds are superb +The graphics are nice +The car handling is very good  +The tracklist is seems very cool +The carlist is very good (Only racecars, mind you) +The menus are easy to use +The in-game interface is easy to understand +Extremely detailed tuning +The AI is good  Cons -Very limited in cars and tracks if you do not pay for them -You need a gamepad or steering wheel to enjoy the game -Tyres seem to last unrealisticly long (Might just be me, I am not experienced in real racing) -Damage can only be enabled on the hardest difficulty (For explanation, see below) -The pit menu is a bit fiddly  This is the longer version of the review: RaceRoom is a very good simulator racing game. This is how it works: There are three difficulty settings. Novice, Amateur and GetReal. Novice is the easiest. It has Traction Control, Anti-Lock Brakes and Auto Braking. Amateur is the middle ground. It only has TC and ABS. GetReal surely does what is says. It gets real. No assists enabled. GetReal is only usable for those with a gamepad or a steering wheel. On a keyboard is utterly useless. There is a damage model, but it can only be used in the 'GetReal' mode, which seems odd to me. In the 'GetReal' mode, you can choose if you want mechanical damage, only cosmetic or none at all. The game also includes a penalty system for corner cutting. You can set it to different kinds of penalties. A slow down penalty, a drive-through penalty or a stop-and-go penalty (Be aware, you'll have to select to serve it manually. Just driving through the pits to serve a drive-through won't work). When you don't pay any money you get acces to three tracks and seven or eight (could be wrong, might be less) cars. Two circuits and one hillclimb course. You can test drive any car you like as many times as you like, but only on a specific track. For the test drive, you can select the difficulty mode. You cannot test drive the tracks, which I think is odd. The game sounds fantastic and looks very good as well.  The tuning in the game is unbelievably detailed and quite frankly scarily detailed. I daren't touch it.   Overall, I think it is a great simulator which everyone interested in racing should give a try.   (This line of text contains some extra love for the people who read the review this far. I've put more time than I should have into this review)  
9201	1	a	Not a bad game considering it is free to play. A few sound effects aren't easy on the ears but runs smooth so far. Forza is still better but this is free. It is still in an early state so there is still room for improvement.
9203	1	a	i really liked that you could use a stearing wheel with the game    but the bad thing is it keeps saying erra 404 and then it has not let me on   if it worked it would be a really good game to play  im in the middle of yes and no
9205	1	a	it is a good game but the steering is difficult and there is not much customisation towards the start of the game.(like more than one car and one track). they should take a leaf out of Forza Motorsports' book.
9207	1	a	so realistic the clutch burned and I couldn't play the game since then  10/10 most realistic feel of any video game
9209	1	a	its good
9211	1	a	Best Race Sim package on the marked right now. There is no way around R3E.       Real racing serieses      Wonderfull content options. You only need to buy what you actually drive. Want to join GT3? 3 bucks for your favourite car and you are in. ( I am kinda lying here: You need tracks as well. The sum will still be well below a full price title.)    Best Sound in genre.    Best AI in genre.    Physics are SimBin quality.    Multiplayer is top notch.   I played pretty much all Sims in past and present, besides AC, which does not come close in terms of content.  Ignore reviewers, who do not understand the economic model of the game.
9213	1	a	Really good racing sim! If you enjoy leaderboard challenges and time attack then the free game has all you might need, and if you want something a little more race-related you can buy one of the content packs that allow you to compete in online championships
9215	1	a	excellent racing simulator there is a lot of content you have to buy including cars and tracks but i will list all of the items you will have. Lakeview hillclimb, Portmiao Circuit (or Algarve GP) , RaceRoom Raceway, Aquila CR1 Sports GT, Saleen S7R, 134 Judd V8, DMD P20, DMD P21, Mistral M530, Mistral M531, Canhard R51, Canhard R52, Cougar C14-1, Cougar C14-2. This is it but there are loads of other cars that you test drive for free whenever you want and as many times as you want. The tracks unfortunately are not testable. Any DLC cars can NOT be used in races or Championships.
9217	1	a	Best F2P racing simulator, great physics, great contests, a lot of fun for petrolhead.
9219	1	a	2nd best only to Assetto Corsa, Recommended,
9221	1	a	so realistic the clutch burned and I couldn't play the game since then  10/10 most realistic feel of any video game
9223	1	a	i really like this racing game and its free
9225	1	a	Before i start i need to ell you that this should neither have thumbs up or down.  (Expand the page for the more positive stuff)  At first i posted a negative review because of its STUPID FREE TO PLAY mecanic and how they charge crasy amounts of money to play more than the bad cars (that i have not tuched since i bought DTM Experience) on Raceroom Raceway and Portimao to be able to really enjoy the game. just take a track for example, a less known and popular track costs 3€ and a legendary track like SPA and Monza costs 5€. And the cars, just to buy 1 car (with all paintjobs for it) it costs 3€. To not pay as much i recomend buying one of the EXPERIENCE packs like DTM and ADAC to get some good cars and tracks.  Apart from that stupid pay system the game is good. they update the game regulary and are adding new things now and then. The physics are good but not perfict. The sound is great. The visuals are amazing. The adaptive AI should mark a milestone in racing sims and are the greatest feature. If you pay for the stuff in game you will get an amazing game.
9227	1	a	Top ;)
9229	1	a	I enjoyed this game it had pretty good graphics.
9231	1	a	It's a great replacement for Forza or Gran Turismo, if you can't afford them (Like me). I highly reccomend this, lots of in game purchases though. :/ Runs great, even on my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ computer. Really fun.
9233	1	a	This game is realistic, fun, and not complicated. The only problem ive found with it, is of course, you can hardly run it on a mid-high end laptop.
9235	1	a	  The Overview
9237	1	a	An amazing race game. Would not recommend it if cost money, but if it is free, I would recommend. The bad thing is there is no multiplayer option. One of the best race games I ever played.
9239	1	a	good idea but really not much to do without a single player
9241	1	a	need to work out on the ui , compatibility , modes and pretty much everything .... driving experience is good thou looking forward
9243	1	a	Note that this really is not a free to play simulation. The free content is no good. To see what this is all about you have to spend cash to get the good packs.   Basically it is like this:   If you follow real life racing and have a 250 usd+ steering wheel setup and knowledge of and love for real life racing dynamics... and 100 usd+ to spend on content. Then this is your sim.   It is hands down the best simulation of actual RACING ever made and with the recent updates it is very close to life like racing. Now that adaptive ai is working it is also the best simulation for single player.   The fact that physics are developed in unison with the real DTM/TT drivers (whom you also see sometimes online) as well as the general engine being awesome makes this the best package right now if you have all prerequisites. If not you will not like it.   You need:   Expensive steering wheel set (without this, do not get it) 100 USD cash for different content (without this, do not get it)  Real life racing knowledge (without this, do not get it)  Following of real life racing and a love for actual track racing (without this, do not get it)    So, disregard the free to play thing. This is a hardcore platform for simulation racing, with a good single player structure as well.    If you like some more casual 'game' style get Project Cars If you like hot-lapping with road cars get Assetto Corsa If you like to devote 16 hours a day towards virtual league racing and disregard the rest of your life, get rFactor2   If you want a good simulation of actual racing, that is also a good single player, offline experience and need a full simulation model, get this
9245	1	a	It's OK... Pros:  Reminds me of Gran Turismo Good physics Cons: SO many paywalls! About 90% of the cars and 95% of the tracks have to be bought! Just release it as a pay to play game and give us all the cars and tracks. Don't give us a slice of the game and tell us to buy the rest. I'd gladly buy all of the game, were it to be released as a p2p game. Like I said, barely any cars for free, and two, that's right, TWO of, like, over fifty tracks. Overall, I give this game a 6/10, purely down to the realistic physics and the fact that it reminds me of Gran Turismo.
9247	1	a	Get a G920 and fast!
9249	1	a	The best thing to watch is a prebuilt dell struggle to run this game
9251	1	a	great balance between game/fun and simulation
9253	1	a	The game is beautiful and crisp. The controls on the keyboard is very difficult, I suggest to use either a gaming controller or a steering wheel. There are some cars that I never heard of which is definitely a plus.    Problem with this game is that you have to pay to play on most of the tracks. You only get three tracks and not sure how to unlock them unless you pay. If you are into paying for stuff in games then you should grab this one if not find something else.
768	0	a	Ever since the latest update the game has been ♥♥♥♥! the loading times are longer the refresh rate of the screen is slower and most of the time the game doesn't even know what to do plus the servers keep on crashing! One small thing that bothers me so much is the fact that we can't even test drive the cars anymore! how am I supposed to try out a car before buying it if I don't even know how it's going to feel?
9255	1	a	This is probably one of the best FREE TO PLAY racing simulators on the market, definitely worth downloading!  However, there is paid DLC for more tracks and cars, and there are plenty of free events to enter with legitimate prizes!  I would say 5 stars, but it deserves 4 stars due to paid DLC instead of releasing a complete game.
9257	1	a	I get a server connection error and i dont know why and it really irritates me because ive spent a lot of money on this game 
9259	1	a	I love cars and 3D racing games and this game gives a good explanation of racing with a variety of tracks and cars to choose from but there are four problems. First there is only one track you have to choose from as far as I can see and you have to pay for the rest of them and I use Aussie Dollars not USD, so that makes it even harder for me to buy the game currency. Second there are only two cars you start off with, the Aquila and the BMW. There both great I can tell you that but the Aquila has just poor steering and same goes with the BMW. Third I don't know how to earn the game currrency so that is a big problem for me. Last it said 2 hours to install and it took 7 hours and I had to wait a day for it to fully load.  I would recommend this game to car and racing fans but just look out for poor steering because the first track you use has a few hard turns and you have to really judge you turning because the turn, most of the time is hard to make and when your in first person view you see the steering wheel only turn a small amount not going in a full rotation like other games. You also have to wait a couple of seconds before the cars goes from N to D or N to R.   Overall I did enjoy the game but its just those few problems that took some of the joy out of playing the game. I would give this game a 6.5/10.
9261	1	a	Its a sim and a good one
9263	1	a	+ graphics are ok, runs in 4k, 60 fps on a GTX980TI + physics are nice and feel realistic + Ai is good, not perfect + free, buy what you want, dodge what you don't want + GT3 cars + updates + nice community + lots of tracks and cars (+) free spotter app, found in the games forum   - multiplayer is kinda dead - no full control during pitting and rolling starts, not like iRacing - no weather change, no rain, no night races - no real flag system  overall a better sim/race game than Assetto and PCARS
9265	1	a	this game is amazing
9267	1	a	the physics suck but the game looks fairly well and its free so that makes up for all of that
9269	1	a	good but i want to play with mates needs multiplayer
9271	1	a	Not much to say. Has hillclimb. 5/10, 'cuz it's generic.
9273	1	a	its awesome 
770	0	a	take to long to load and my controler dont work on it and the price for it to much for a game
9275	1	a	As of right now this game only has one track and this Teaser feels like a alpha since there is not much to do in the game as of right now. The cars mechanics are not that smooth and it can get out of control really easy if you fall off the track just a little. The graphics look decent. The sound of the car are not the best sounding. It has potential though and we will see when the time comes if this game has what it takes to become a really good racing game.
9277	1	a	Fell asleep while playing this game. 11/10
9279	1	a	RaceRoom is an excellent racing sim, one of the best actually. It has amazing graphics, physics and sounds. It runs smooth but there's one flaw and it's somewhat big. The real downside of this game is it's purchasing system and expandability. Remember, this game is free, but in reality, it's not. There is a plethora of cars and tracks, however, you only get a very small handful of each as Free to play. And I mean pretty small where I'd be dying to try the cars and tracks that you would need to buy each one separately, which to me is a gimmick.  Overall, RaceRoom is a great game and all, it's just that the developers had incorporated a very ♥♥♥♥♥♥ expansion system. In my sense, I would've rather paid for the game to get all of the features in place of it being free.
9281	1	a	Pretty good simulator, but way too expensive to really get going. No Nordschleife, and no civilian cars and not enough tracks.
9283	1	a	Having spent some time around the various racing sims, I can say this is not the most realistic, not the best looking and not the best feeling (Force Feedback) sim out there. But currently it's my favourite,  The game is free, but you have to pay for content like cars and tracks. Considering that you probably will have a few favorite rides and some favourite places to race, you don't need to buy everyting, and with that in mind the pricing is reasonable (just buy a points package and get the content you are interested in). To get everything you have to spend a significant amount of cash, but it's still cheaper than playing iRacing or something like Project CARS / Assetto Corsa with all DLC considering the amoutn of content that is available.  Now for the game itself. The graphics are good, though not mind blowing, but considering that you will be focused on turning that wheel and operating the pedals, you will forget about visuals fast. The sound on the other hand is the best in the market hands down.   Handling is fairly realistic, though not hardcore difficult like rFactor 2, with good Force Feedback once configured properly. Though it is possible to enhoy the game with a controller, a wheel is highly recommended.  Now for the sweet parts - contrary to other sims, there is a good combination of cars and tracks. You will not see stuff like 1 car per class or useless roadcars that go slow and spin out all the time - no Ferraris and SLS AMGs, no drifting. This is all about racing. And racing is good. The AI is one of the better ones, so you will not get divebombed by crazy maniacs all the time, and the difficulty setting will accomodate players of all skill levels. Not the best AI in the market, but quite good and most of all fun,  The bad stuff? No night racing or rain. Not really a big deal, since in other sims these types of races a cool to look at, but mostly hard and frustrating. Perhaps the biggest issue to me is the lack of a dynamic racing line, where the track rubbers up in places where cars drive and you have more grip there. Not really a problem, but once you try something like this in rFactor 2, you do notice it other games. Raceroom also lacks open-wheelers and does not have many classic cars, but that is to change soon. Another thing is a full flag rules system is still to be addes at some point.  All in all, of all the new generation of racing sims, Raceroon seems most fun thanks to a good selection of cars and tracks and good AI. If you are looking to get into simracing this is defo the game to try. Other sims might have better graphics or laser scanned tracks, but not the AI Racerrom has nor the amount of actual racing content we see here.

9289	1	a	By the looks of the pictures, it looks cool and AMAZING :), an_^yone who is interested in cars, racing, action-pack, it'd be the game, and the limit of speed is nothing compared to the limit of your mind ^_^
9291	1	a	this is a great game, great driving experience
9293	1	a	Race without a face  30/10

9297	1	a	Why cant i register an account? It keeps saying that i should refresh but it repeats and never stops.
9299	1	a	Fun I rate this game a ''9/10''!
9301	1	a	I'm looking for graphics, content, and cost. Here's what they are in order:  9/10  3/10  1000/10  Overall, It's a good game!
9303	1	a	Race without a face  30/10
9305	1	a	i rate this pos a 1out of 10 fix all the problems it sucks u cant turn ur stupid car and when u do u spin out of control u suck ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥
9307	1	a	EEXXXTREEEMLY HARD!!! HOLY ♥♥♥♥ IT WAS HARD TO DRIVE! IS REAL LIFE RACING HARD LIKE THIS???
9309	1	a	the physics suck but the game looks fairly well and its free so that makes up for all of that
9311	1	a	its awesome 
9313	1	a	Best sim racing games
9315	1	a	super bad handiling when using keyboard when i started out i shift into 6 gear and i start spinning out also when i go around the corners and turn a bit i start to spin out out lose grip and i try counter steering and completly off the throtle and i still lose grip so i guees play this game with a wheel, shiter and pedals good grahpics and good audio
9317	1	a	Not much to say. Has hillclimb. 5/10, 'cuz it's generic.
9319	1	a	Fell asleep while playing this game. 11/10
9321	1	a	I'd highly suggest a racing wheel!
9323	1	a	First impressions are very impressive. Drives really nice, force feedback is excellent. The track I was on was exceelent and AI behaves very well. Free to play and if you like it theres loads of DLC you can purchase. Its worth downloading just for the free go. I highly recommend it and this Race SIM is way up there with Assetto corsa and Project cars.
9325	1	a	10/10 A brilliant and enjoyable racing game fantastic for free to play!
9327	1	a	1. Leave this page. 2. Search for Assetto Corsa. 3. Buy Assetto Corsa. 4. Profit!
9329	1	a	(in gameboy comercial kids voice) LOOK AT THOSE GRAPHICS!!!! yeah... not too great of graphics honestly my magic schoolbus click to learn games i had when i was 5 had better graphics than this. and logic is only a little bit weird on it like if i turn i spin the ♥♥♥♥ out of control but other than that the games great and besides its free !!! it has a multiplayer interface that i have not tried yet but before you play you have to create an account and i had troubles with that after i made my account it said that i had the wrong password even though i know thats the password cause i just made it but its not that bad like i will play it again and make a video on it no doubt . just thought id point out some things before you play it so you know whaT to expect
9331	1	a	THE most realistic racing sim in the world. Amazing multiplayer and completely free to play!
776	0	a	The game itself is OK, but the program is so hard to get running properly.  
777	0	a	same simbin guys, same simbin race07 cars &amp; tracks, why would i buy group 5 pack when i can fire up the Retro expansion for Race 07- 74 vette 70 camaro, bmw, opel, volvo...its all there, an the tracks.  Raceroom has just repackaged all the sht from Race 07 an spinoffs/packs.. gtr evo, injection, an theres tracks online for free, Ive downloaded sebring, lime rock, watkins glen they all work fine look good.  to get the crap i already have since they give u nuthin with RR download, would cost over 100US. wtf man, an they cant even make it work pfffttt...lol
778	0	a	160 dollars in dlc. here's a better business model: make the game 15 dollars and you won't have to pray and beg for people to buy overpriced DLC.
9333	1	a	a nice free racing game!! super cool  only 1 thing.... i need to buy so many race classes and tracks... so many....
9335	1	a	It`s a fun racing game that you don`t need to pay for...!
9337	1	a	Drives 1 inch off a straight line: 'Lap invalidated due to corner cutting'  10/10 would throw PC out the Window again
9339	1	a	This is a great game if you are looking for IRacing for Free.
9341	1	a	FFB = 10/10 Sounds= 10/10 Physics = 9/10 Color saturation =8/10 Track graphics = 7/10 Car graphics = 6/10 ( 360 hand animation is not suported ) :( Menu = 8/10  CPU+GPU optimization = 8/10 Wheel suport = 9/10 Content = 8/10 Reflections/shadows = 7/10  Overall one of the Best if not the Best Simulator.
9343	1	a	Nice game
780	0	a	This game in my opinion don t have great future. Need to spent a lot of money to have decent cars to play. No logic to need to buy car by car or track by track to play happy.
781	0	a	same simbin guys, same simbin race07 cars &amp; tracks, why would i buy group 5 pack when i can fire up the Retro expansion for Race 07- 74 vette 70 camaro, bmw, opel, volvo...its all there, an the tracks.

9345	1	a	Great sim!
9347	1	a	This is a great game if you are looking for IRacing for Free.
9349	1	a	hey Project Cars,go ♥♥♥♥ yourself
9351	1	a	One of the best racing simulations out there......and its free!!!!!!!   10/10
9353	1	a	Great wheel support and loads of fun to play
9355	1	a	I don't even play this game and it's already better than Project Cars
9357	1	a	Its a good simulation game
9359	1	a	I do not like free-to-play or micro-transactions in any game. But this is SimBin. So you know you get one of the top (maybe the top) racing sim experience you can get. Personally I will support SimBin as much as I can.
9361	1	a	will be a good game with more content i.e multiplayer best realistic racer youl find on steam.
9363	1	a	Fantastic F2P game with realistic graphics and unparalleled driving experience!
9365	1	a	it Is A great game!
9367	1	a	The best f2p sim imo.
9369	1	a	Great game. Lots of fun.
9371	1	a	I haven't played many racing games. But this game is pretty top notch on the controls and the Experience Of Difficulty. Playing w/ just keybored is rough but tuning the controls and improving each tweak to you're setting, makes the game worthwhile for me. I recommend this game.
9373	1	a	is it a good drifting game??
9375	1	a	just use a steering wheel and you're gonna be ok if not.... gtfo

792	0	a	I was very excited to check out this game. Sadly, every track /server that had drivers in it apparently would cost me REAL money to purchase before I can race on it. WTF? F2P my ♥♥♥. I'll stick with The Crew and Need for Speed.
9379	1	a	Plays really well on my AMD E1-1500 w/HD Graphics (1.48GHz) 4GB RAM Loving it, it's really enjoyable! ^-^  FPS roughly 35-50
9381	1	a	Great game. Lots of fun.
794	0	a	Google 'banned for no reason' racedepartment, then google SMS simbin, and then laugh at how awful it is and how it has nothing to do with this game.
9383	1	a	Great game but needs to go VR
795	0	a	Just a ♥♥♥♥ !It looks cool in the store but now i have played it and it's terrible .
9385	1	a	good game!! its the free version of GT6/GT5  
9387	1	a	Real sim racing!!
9389	1	a	I played this game before its initial release. I didn't invest too much of my time into it, though. But the full release was great. Tons of cars and championships, realistic gameplay and physics, a must have for people who like racing games. And AWESOME if you have a racing sim setup or just a steering wheel.
9391	1	a	this game is cool but i don't know how to play it becouse i'm a counter strike player
9393	1	a	i cant start up the game 
9395	1	a	You can't call game Free2Play, if you have to pay real money to pay for tracks and competitions to play. Game lags on every crash to the wall. On the other hand, cars have nice sound and I hope they will be releasing updates and make this game better, potencial is real.
9397	1	a	HYVÄT GRAFFAT 4/5 
9399	1	a	Pretty good racing game, cool graphics! I like the phisics, but it would be better with view management!
9401	1	a	This is a great free racing sim. Very realistic graphics and physics.
9403	1	a	Without VR support i havent touched it since i got an Oculus.
9405	1	a	This is a great free racing sim. Very realistic graphics and physics.
9407	1	a	Without VR support i havent touched it since i got an Oculus.
9409	1	a	control car ♥♥♥♥ing hard ♥♥♥♥♥es  -10/10 will setting again
9411	1	a	I feel like i would enjoy this game a bunch if i put some money into it, other then that what you can do is very limited.
9413	1	a	Good game, very realistic the only bad this is that you have to buy cars on steam
9415	1	a	It was a good game until the update. I cant play it now because i have windows XP and the game no longer supports it. so 7/10
9417	1	a	not user-friendly if you're new on this kind of game, and handling the car is difficult if you only use a keyboard.
9419	1	a	When i registered and then try to sign in it wasnt letting me it said that it was incorrect anny suggestions?
9421	1	a	This game has really improved I would put it among some of the best sims racing games out there Thanks RaceRoom
9423	1	a	Never played, not properly, but I like the videos.
9425	1	a	Good Graphics
9427	1	a	This is a game for people who enjoy complex racing. I haven't tried my wheel yet but I bet it works like a dream with this game.
804	0	a	very bad   you cant setup the car the damn things wont brake dont handle like a car even in manual it sucks big time
9429	1	a	Amazing game! amazing physics, its such a great racing-sim, ver joyful to play with a nice racing wheel setup!
806	0	a	If it wasn't for the Free2Play system the game would have my recommendation  F2Play/10
807	0	a	Great i got the game, now how do i turn the car the only thing i can do is bump into walls
808	0	a	first i check on project car saw people comment said this game are better then that. so i check out and felt whynot is free lets download and play. after play serioustly.. i just spend this little bit time on this game i giving up. 1st two maps. so stingy ... i know dev hard work to make the game work but not free until so less map. too less car as well. game experience i felt grid win anytime. cant even close to real sim.   as i remember i play once on my friend gt5 . gt5 far more alot better.
809	0	a	Disappointed. Game wouldnt start. Log shows playing time but never even got to start grid.

812	0	a	It's very hard to control the car even not in any corner. I will not recommend this game unless you seeking for the real life experience AND have appropriate equipment such as a steering wheel.
9431	1	a	One of the best free2play racing games I've ever played! It's seriously amazing. I'm not a pro and I've never driven a car, but the handling feels pretty realistic imo! It's pretty hard at the beginning, but I mastered the novice difficulity in ~30 minutes. Definately give it a shot, it's free!  Edit: The AI is way too aggressive. They wreck whatever they see. I'm trying to peacefully turn, but NO. They have to bump me and make me do a 360 turn. Fix the damn AI.
9433	1	a	dont have much time on this but for free i think its good.
839	0	a	So many better options out there. Stupid A'I', bad netcode, ripoff payment system, dated.
840	0	a	Costs money to get anything good... :/ Description overrates the game, but it's free, so check it out and see what I mean. :P
841	0	a	Don't bother
842	0	a	10/10 jk this game is cancer.
843	0	a	loo0000ng loading time.. *with millions of Os. uninstall directly..
844	0	a	By far the worst racing game ever the controls are terrible and there is no AI racing only time attack modes for what i can see in the game. All i have to say is go play the forza, grid and grand turismo series they are way better then this steaming pile of crap.
845	0	a	Is this game an alpha? I'm almost offended by the fact that the game feels unfinished, but they already have a DLC on sale. Simply make the game paid then!   You almost cannot feel the game without paying (meaning one or two free 'tracks'. All the real ones are paid for), there is no story-mode, the physic is not well done (no car damage, no aerodinamics, very limited tarmac/grass friction) and you cannot assign more than one button to the same action (meaning that I need to choose if I want paddle shifters or stick, but never both).  The game feels like a copy of ACR, and doesn't live up to his competition.  Otherwise, the menu system is very nice, once you get used to it.
846	0	a	bad graphics..
847	0	a	got it PCMag/BundleStars bundle with RACO 07 a GTR Evolution... Terrible game! Randomly 'alt-tabs' me out and there is no other option than kill the proccess. Not a single ♥♥♥♥ in this game is free, everything is for som points
848	0	a	Its not worth the download. The DLC page they have in the game looks better than the MAIN MENU IN THE GAME. Says alot about the Devs...
849	0	a	Even though this is the only free car simulator, it's not that good and not what I expected by some gameplay.
850	0	a	As allways there is this horrible micro transactions. well not so micro in this case! I rather pay 50$ for a complete game then paying over 100$ for all the content you want! Shame on you game developers!
851	0	a	Trying to get a full feel of the car and it auto brakes on aproach and into the turns. I can't find a way to turn it off. Whats racing with an auto brake??? I'm removing this game and would not recommend it to anyone.
852	0	a	In options it sees my gamepad controller, but has no way to select it. Forces you to use keyboard. Uninstalled.
9435	1	a	This is pretty fun!
853	0	a	This seems like a good take on a racing simulator. But it lacks a lot.  First, the free content of the game is limited and will bore you fast (1 track, 2 cars), I feel like we could have had a bit more, even if we get free testdrives of other cars on weekends. Also there is no multiplayer apart for laptimes and that makes it just you on the same track trying to get better times.  Graphicwise and simulation was it is great, nice graphics and it gives a realistic handling.   The ingame purchases are a bit expensive for what I'd aim for, but they are good and if you can afford it really take the game further.  It's free to play, so It's a goodie to have but overal it isn't quite finished yet.
854	0	a	I literraly fell asleep to this.
855	0	a	how to register account???
856	0	a	Cool Game,But No unlocking cars,buy tracks,and crazy load times so i would not reccomend it
857	0	a	Not recommended at all, reasons? well, requires registration out of steam, non responsive web page, finaly got the registraton and activated my account, turned on the game, loged in using my registration details and i got server error, server error, server error.  After a long time i finaly made it to main menu, choose a race type, hmm all options are grey but one, fine, Singleplayer/Hotlapping, hmm choose car, buy, buy, buy, ok only 1 car here? choose track, buy, buy, buy, only one track here? a lot to buy but nothing included. Seriously this is NOT a free to play game its DAMN upgradable DEMO!!!!!!!  A question, why the hell they want a real name, date of birth, country of origin and country of residence details???? You do have to fill that in on the registraton page, without it you cannot complete the registration  Should be removed from steam, too many bad reviews about how expensie actually this F2P game can get, stinks like some kind of rip off, plus not even Steam cares about my date of birth, so why should i give it to a 3rd party? What is this, some kind of a phishing scam? A paradox, the most expensive free to play game i ever got my hands on
858	0	a	i only got one car not 3 an 1 track and can only practic
859	0	a	simply the devrlopers are plain liers the promised multiplayer over a year ago, i know damn well it doenst take this long to develope multiplayer functions and servers ther bsing way to much

862	0	a	just sits there showing foggy cars, never loads to show the menus even after an hour
863	0	a	Overly complicated with way too many ingame purcases, I would rather just pay for the game. It is very difficult to get into, go by Grid instead. (This game is not worth the download time).
864	0	a	You need to buy all cars you want to play with. Free???
865	0	a	Good sounds and bad controlls...i have just started the game and i do not undestand a thing.It is even not well optimzed. you have a lot of frame drops.
866	0	a	It's clear that, on the developer's list of priorities, the game's features and ability to engage took second place to how it would be monetised. Some of the worst habits of game publishers are on display here, and to add insult to injury, the game they're corrupting here wasn't really worth paying for in the first place.

869	0	a	how to login to the game? 
870	0	a	I will cut to the chase; it is so, so difficult to reccomend this game, even to a proper petrolhead.  When you first download the game for free, you will be bewildered with a very awkward UI menu layout. It took me a few minutes to get to the track at first, when really this could of been achieved in under 20 seconds. On the track, you will be star-stuck with amazing graphics, I will not lie about that. The graphics are up there with any top race sim. Start driving, and hooray, a good car noise, and the developers have programmed the game well to work with a force feedback racing wheel.  But that's it. Now for the negatives. The cars (even the slick racers) understeer so inaccurately. I'm no mega physics guy, but I know something's wrong when a leading class race car won't get round a bend at 40mph. Obviously there is no tyre shreak to warn you; you're on slicks. I tested to make sure it wasn't just a simulation of cold tyres = no grip, but after countless laps the car continued to behave like it had tyres 1mm wide.  Surely the elephant in the room is the DLC. You start with about 4 cars and two tracks. That is fine, it is free after all I suppose. But add the DLC costs up for all the tracks and cars, and you are looking at triple figure sums. Honestly, I'd rather just pay £35 for the game outright and get everything, without a free version.  You can take this with a pinch of salt as it's just a minor person's opinion. But playing for 2 and a half hours (which doesn't sound like much) has made me stand by those opinions. Since it's free, just go ahead and download to see for yourself. It's like a lot of modern games these days; very pretty, but no actual gameplay.
871	0	a	There is no racing unless you shell out money. You may only do a hotlap. The Menu system is difficult to navigate around.
872	0	a	this game sucks
873	0	a	Felt like I was driving a mustang. I couldn't turn very well.
874	0	a	Terrible graphics, terrible gameplay, terrible handling .... I downloaded this after reading all the positive comments but the cars drive like they are floating on air not the track ...

876	0	a	it doesnt work for me. fails to launch
877	0	a	What a waste of time downloading this 11GB game, when all you can do is race against yourself on one track.
878	0	a	This game is a joke right? It ♥♥♥♥in sucks! The AI is agressive as hell! They can slam into you, even just slightly touch you and you spin outta control, you can slam into them and they won't nudge, half the veichales picutres when choosing don't ewven show up and the handling is disgusting, just erase this game!
9437	1	a	very good reccommed
882	0	a	First off great game/sim......................if and its a big if you can actually play it,connection errors are a very big problem in this title and i can no longer play this game due to the now famous 503 error,no response atall from many messages sent to Sector 3,very very poor at the monet and one angry customer.
9439	1	a	Nice game
883	0	a	Cant play multiplayer anyome, if i click on multiplayer i go automatic to the official side from RRRE and cant back? what can i do.
884	0	a	I bought Audi TT RS for 3 bucks, and I only got one single livery? If I want to get all liveries, they will cost 7 bucks? WOW..................AC has dlc that comes with 7 cars that only cost 6.99............
9441	1	a	dis so cool game fainks stim
885	0	a	2 words..... BUY NOW and i dont mean buy the game! rather than a free game that you have to pay to play, why not just charge for the game? the game is average at best, but every car you want costs money,  you get about 3 to choose from, practice session just gave me false start regardless of how i set off! buggy game that i would not recommend even at the high price of free! you will end up spending £60 just to drive the cars you want!  couldn't see the track half the time in racing as dash was too high, not very good physics either. shame it could be so much more
886	0	a	Multiplayer contains alot of trolls with no admins to get arid of them and im a big fan of multiplayer when It comes to online games. But for this game, you get at least a couple trolls here and there in a server. They often like to ram you off the track or use their car to block part of the track. Drivers like me would rather roleplay and play the game the professional way. It only takes one troll to ruin the server gameplay and there is no body to take care of the issue. If trolls were not such a big problem, I would recommend this game, but I don't. Just about ready to uninstall this game if multiplayer doesn't get any better.

9443	1	a	Nice game
9445	1	a	1000+ hours of play-time...  Time for a review :)  So, in the past i've written early review and i was'nt alway's happy about the progress of fixing problems... But ater a while now i've discovered it is best to wait before commenting, people are'nt always up-to-date with the reported bugs! When so, an update is in the making!  As for the gameplay Depending on your in-game graphic settings, the experience can be altered by adding more or less options.Play Single Player (multiple modes available) to practice when your friends are offline!  When online? Just battle each other :)  My gamegear (min recommanded for medium to high experience): - Intel core i5 - Nvidia GTX 760 - Memory: 16 gb - Logitech G29 DF racewheel and pedals - Crew ChiefV4 - Some additional packs from RaceRoom Store
9447	1	a	Great experience! Most of the cars feels 'easy' to drive at high speeds, and i mean it like they seem to be smooth just like the real ones, Ive seen too many racing games where you reach the top speed and the car starts to wobble like its made of jelly! Seriously!? these cars are built to be stable aS ♥♥♥♥ at top speeds! and in overall the handling feels solid and you can adjust these cars endlessly. One of the few CON´s i can think is that it still sometimes feels kinda un-polished (dont mean the cars alone) and there could be more players in multiplayer... and speaking of multiplayer, most of the drivers there seems to drive clean. Sure there are some rammers but they are the ones who generally get bored of the game very early.  It also has the finest track ever made!   You can complain about the pricing of the cars but atleast you can just buy one car from each group (and test it before buying)  So overall i think this is the best racing game at the moment. AND the sound effects leave any other car game light years behind!  Try it, buy it, love it!
888	0	a	Can't say much about the base free-to-play game since I really haven't played it (just a single race) but the DTM Experience 2013 DLC is a must buy! Got on sale at the Humble Store for $6.24! This is one of the most realistic racing sims I have played...the sounds are incredible!  UPDATE: I really can't recommend this game based soley on the cash grab that it is. Even during Sector 3's summer sale the addon packs are quite over-priced. Sector 3 really nickel and dimes you for every little tiny aspect of this game. During the summer sale if you were to buy everything on sale it would have cost over $100. I bought Assetto Corsa with DLC included for less than $30. I bought Project Cars for $35 and the DLC is dirt cheap! If you have a wallet that is fat full of cash then go ahead and buy everything Sector 3 wants you to buy. Afterall, it's a great sim to race in but if you value your dollar look to a cheaper alternative.
889	0	a	It would have been a good game   If it actually runs
9449	1	a	The controls suck but its a free game so you can't get mad because that is the only downside. You move and steer with the arrow keys. The graphics, if you have a monster pc like me, are AMAZING!!!!! besides the jerky movement of the steering wheel, it feels like you are in the driver's seat!
917	0	a	Wait for Project Cars. Based on playing just 13 minutes I could already tell it was abysmal. The feel, mechanics, and animations of the car and driver were very poor. Graphics were alright, still looked sub-par however.
918	0	a	Just getting a black screen then the movie, nothing else.
919	0	a	You really do get what you pay for here.
920	0	a	The best thing about this game are the sounds. The price model is bad. You can get a better AA-AAA racing title that is just as good for the price. Their older game GT Legends GTR series and Race series are just as good if not better. If Simbin/Sector3 re-release this game as a standalone game with steamworks for multiplayer with dedicated servers and traditional DLC I may consider buying.  Get the older SimBin titles NFS Shift 1/2 and Grid 1 and Autosport and Project Cars You will thank me later Until major changes are made.........
921	0	a	
922	0	a	It looks like a good game but I can't even play it due to the loading of races bringing you back to the main menu or it crashing.
923	0	a	think of a Hamburger : Bottom Buns = Basic Game Bacon = DLCs Cheese = DLCs Cabbage = DLCs Tomato(Sauce) = DLCs Top Buns = All DLC  i cant even get to play -_- took ages to register, and end up on ERROR 503 - Service Portal not available
924	0	a	I have played a lot of racing games in my time mostly on the various playstation sytems. Looking at the screenshots of the game and the trailers it looks quite something, when you download the game however things change. Firstly the 'Free to play' element is a 5 cars on a 5 tracks quite disappointing but it cost nothing. First thing that annoyed is the braking signs that suggest that target audience is 3 year olds, colour coding? aren't the distance signs good enough for a simulator.  Anyway, after starting an event in a stick shift I was quite pleased to see one hand went to change gear when required, my illusions were shattered when I came to a corner though. I pressed the right arrow key the steering wheel imediately went to full lock and I understeered into the wall so I thought fair enough I was a bit fast but I expected for the car to at least attempt the corner, (for example gran turismo you can enter a hairpin flat and you will take a curved path into the wall). I tried the next corner at a snail's pace (light sweeper probably a 3rd usually, I took it in 1st )giving an impovement, enough that I made it round. Something that bothers me is the fact it just says speed on the display is it km/h or mph? considering I was doing 190 in first in a DTM car I doubt it's either.  Next I took a paddle shift prototype, the paddles did not move at the correct which also bothered me. Furthermore, the camera is positioned so close to the steering wheel that it seems the driver is trying to rub his chin on it. Next the sounds, it's free to play I know but I expected it least to sound like an actual race car as this was. tunnels make exhaust notes but the tunnel I entered was extremely underwhelming.  All I can say is at least it wont cost you any money just time
925	0	a	Can't believe this is a Free to play game! Have any lab rat try out yet? (p/s: don't try this out)
926	0	a	This game seems to ♥♥♥♥ out errors to a lot of people.  Pros: Pretty cars and tracks Decent physics and sound Racing and stuff  Cons: Truckload of errors while attempting to login Pay to unlock  $Milkyway error purchase unsuccessful? WHAT? It's either error this or error that. Don't touch this game if you're not made of money.
927	0	a	Just getting a black screen then the movie, nothing else.

929	0	a	One of the worst games I think I've played on here. The steering is terrible. My gamepad is set up fine but the cars are just terrible to control. Needs to be a little smoother to be enjoyable.
930	0	a	Controlls are WAY to hard, only partial controller support, terrible graphics, NOT RECOMENDED
931	0	a	free to play is not a one lap - one car - no race experience
932	0	a	This is crap. I can't drive, tutorial doesn't work no matter HOW many updates, and bad FPS- not connected to anyone.
933	0	a	One track one skin one car the rest is pay to play if you want them instently
934	0	a	I tried this and it failed to impress me. I love racing games and have been playing them for 15 years on PC. I couldn't get my wheel which admittedly is pretty ancient) to work properly, found the cars seemed to have no weight. Looks pretty enough but if actual gameplay sucks then its not worth the price of admission. In my humble opinion this doesn't hold a candle to the brilliant but old Papyrus Grand Prix Legends, which is still a challenging and enjoyable experience even ten years on. I can't recommend this game really but if you can get abetter controller it may be worth the time giving it a try but the free content is pretty limited and should really be described as a Demo not Free To Play. Disappointed as so many race games seem to be aimed at the console market, Codemasters used to produce some fun driving games but now fill their arcade racers with fantasy city tracks and boring drift courses, Isn't that what NFS was for? Perhaps I'll have better luck with AC. Meanwhile back to Grand Prix Legends ha ha. I also found the menu system here really clunky and poorly thought out, I quickly got bored with the free content and wasn't charmed enough to risk good money on this yet . I know it is still in development but it still needs a lot of work to get it sweet.

943	0	a	I love racing games and this one is the worse out of them. A huge delay with control input. I click to go forwards it thinks about it then does it 10 seconds later. Want to turn not going to happen. Tried a variaty of settings with no joy. uninstalled and never being reinstalled
944	0	a	DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS TITLE!! THERE ARE BETTER SIM-RACING GAMES!   I recommend iRacing, Rfactor2, Live for Speed, Project C.A.R.S, F1 Series, Assetto Corsa, Richard Burns Rally..... and Grand Turismo 5/6
945	0	a	I really thought this would be the next gen Simulation racer that all PC gamers are looking for, while it has all the right stuff, decent graphics, not the best, but much better than the likes of Race 07 and other Sim bin games. The sounds are great too, and the physics are great, but it's missing the most essential element: Multiplayer.  On this basis alone I cannot recommend this game, you can only do time trials so many times and for so long. Another big reason why I won't recommend this game is because, although this game is free to play, the micro transaction system is too expensive. I have done the math and nothing is worth paying that amount of money for, you even have to pay for the realism mode, I mean, who does that on a supposed racing sim?  The free stuff is not enough to keep you going for more than a few hours, there just isn't enough free content to even make this a viable free to play option.  Also, the big attraction to Race 07 and other titles are all the mods you can get, this game does not support modding, so it seems, and you have to pay for everything you want, this I'm sure has detered many previous Sim Bin fans.  If Sim Bin are prepared to drop the prices on all their tracks and cars, and introduce multiplayer, or at least bot cars, then I will consider reviewing my recommendation.  Edit: Even on 50% Easter sale on all cars and tracks, I decided it wasn't worth it. Perhaps if Sim Bin put a 50% discount on the DTM experience, then I may just buy that, as the DTM Experience opens the Beta multiplayer mode.
946	0	a	When I first saw the gameplay video and screenshots of the game, I thought it would be a realistic and exciting racing game with tons of features. Oh boy, I was wrong. When I clicked the play button, I've suffered enough already and quickly uninstalled it. RaceRoom Racing Experience is a crap game with a load of bullcrap in it and shouldn't be bought by all people for eternity.  Yes, the game's graphics and details are pretty good until your 'racing experience' being annoyed by the terrible car handling and Playstation 1 car sounds. Believe me, handling in here is screwed up and probably the most annoying thing you will encounter in the game. Cars will spin out like crazy with no control at all. This is no racing simulator, it's just a game with glitchy cars spinning around and hit each other.  So my final verdict is that, while the game has realistic graphics, the terrible handling just hindered you for maintaining the real racing experience. The game does have a lot of potential, but SimBin, the developers, executed this in a wrong way and that chance is gone forever, and it wouldn't able to compete with current racing games like Gran Turismo, Forza Motorsport, and Grid.  Although patches has been released, still, they're too late to fix RaceRoom's glitchy and broken gameplay.  And although I played RaceRoom for a short time, 15 minutes is enough for you to suffer from it's crappy gameplay.  Sorry, SimBin, but I have to give this game a 3/10 :(
947	0	a	Very poor driving experience, the game is HD but the graphics don't excel.  The menu is very hard and mazed up.  As an actual ingame footage... on every challange you are allowed to controll your car after 3 seconds on which if you continuously press the acceleration button you will lose controll of your car immediatelly. No to mention that everytime you are forced to start the game on a curve.  There are 3 dificulties that you can chose BEFORE you enter a race, once you are in it, you cannot adjust them. Novice- the one that the AI breaks like your grandma' Normal - the decent way to play this game aaand Advanced - unplayable from keyboard   Few tracks, few cars. You are forced to play a specific car on a specific race.   The game looks ok from the outside but its not worthing the time waiting to install.  Cheers, predatorX
948	0	a	This game is so c**p. You firstly have to create another account aside from your steam one. Them once you start the grapichs are aweful and then you have to pay real money to get more races and cars
949	0	a	♥♥♥♥ this game! The steering is ♥♥♥♥ed! I spin out every on every corner. I get disqualified because the game thinks I'm too horrible. Took forever to download. Takes up lots of space. Total waste of disk space. The game is simply put ♥♥♥♥ed! -10/10!!! That's NEGATIVE ten out of ten!!!!!!!!
950	0	a	was looking forward to this but sadly after installing onto windows 10. when i ran the game my mouse just heads to the top of the screen. if i pull it down it just runs up the screen again. so after running the game. the mouse heads up the screen again. so gave up playing did not even manage to get to the first race. have not uninstalled. just incase there is a fix. but for now if anyone knowa of a fix for this. please let me know. at the moment i will review this down. and when i manage to play the game i will give an update.
951	0	a	I dont like that even on novice, you cant just race full speed and not spin around like a freak in curves. Yeez guys. please

960	0	a	Update to review below: I keep getting spam emails from Raceroom despite trying to unsubscribe numerous times. Avoid.   ----- Game is a half decent driving sim but is ruined by the fact that anything that goes wrong leaves you facing the wrong way on the track. I can understand it happening sometimes, but when it is everytime something is badly wrong with the physics engine.  For reference I have played iRacing and Project Cars with steering wheel so know what end of a car is what.
961	0	a	keeps crashing everytime i try to play it
9451	1	a	great game!
9453	1	a	I don't have to play this game to see this game ROCKS, Welcome back to the Grand Turizmo Physics, in a Tweak Arcade Style UI.
992	0	a	This game forces my computer to run using integrated graphics causing it to run terribly. And so many microtransactions making the game unplayable
993	0	a	Everytime I try to launch the game on Windows 10 it crashes. Please fix.
994	0	a	I have no idea why i downloaded this, first of all it did not even open, had to verify the cache and to redownload more 600MB, well at least it worked, first glance was meh, i mean the UI is outdated, and looks like few years old. What it is funny is it detected my xBox controller, and told me its xBox controller, name it, so i did, and i clicked on race with the mouse, and the practice begins, and i am like vrom vrom, and well, nothing happened :|, i clicked the settings to find my controller profile empty, even though the game knew it was xBox controller and asked me if it was a wheel or a gamepad or keyboard. . Forget it about the control, how on earth 17GB game does NOT have a tutorial, i mean mobile games have it :|, had to push the standard buttons to change the view or anything and i had to just open the control menu to look it up ' i changed to keyboard to save the time assigning everysingle button', and i was like oh yeah its working now, thats a good sign, i guess. . i started with the first car, the control is decent, but i have to say you have to accept the fact that NO ONE without wheel and KNOW how to play will even make a few turns, no assists what so ever, i dont mind because its simulator not NFS, but Project Cars sim too, and got assists too for new drivers. . I hated the first car, so i started to looking up for another car, and i found only 1 more car is avilable the rest is locked for real money, well at least let us try a BMW for a start then let us play with Fiat :D, i mean for real, if EVEN i want to buy those cars, with the horrible cars avilable for me to test, i will NOT EVER buy another car, no way in hell. . And about the graphics, its like old flat cars with some AA and the track and the surronding is old, VERY old with only motion blur and post proccessing to make it look better, the thing is the AA and the post made the cars not realistic at all, no details what so ever, GRID 2, Dirt 3, Project cars even NFS Rivals or freaking NFS hot pursiut looks better than these cars, its just sad, the oversized game makes me think of GTA, the horrible optimaization and compressing. . IF and only IF you are smart, you could EASILY say this is either demo and remove 15 GB or something and let everyone try it and make the full game with all the cars avilable, or freaking DLCs, not forcing me to download 14GB ish to try only 2 or 3 cars, with 3 tracks, i mean what have you been drinking, i think most of the negative reviews because we had to download 14GB just to TRY the game, and with a little to nothing of content. . I have no idea why some people saying this game is good, its decent for free game yes, but the financing is s**t, you act like you force us to give this game bad review, couldnt you use your brains and make test and see if ANYONE will like the concept of downloading 14GB of NOTHING ??? . I dont know if whoever download the game and liked did NOT saw or tried any other racing games, or have plazing download speed, cause it took like 2 days to download and i am really angry because i really for the first time WASTED my time even playing it.
9455	1	a	best simulation !!!! i aggre about the cost for full game !!!hoping for some good offers !!!!
1011	0	a	could not figer out how to make my account :(
1012	0	a	Wow. Would you look at that, a game that would have been good, had they not done it like they did that garbage game NFS Shift. Its not a drifting game. The handling of the vehicles of this game are extremely horrible- at the best. Don't waste your time. I realize tires grip differently at high speed. But in real life, these kinds of cars designed to stick to the road WAAAAY more than they do in this game. Garbage, uninstalling it as well.
1013	0	a	Never recieved the activation email ... NEVAH!  10/10 would wait again
1014	0	a	laggy as hell to say the least on a high end gaming machine and not much content unless you PAY for everything in the game useless for extreme racing gamers but ok if your bored crapless
1015	0	a	This game is stupid dont have thurstmaster wheel setup... I have a Thrustmaster Ferrari 458 Italia and doesnt work. So this just sucks... dont waiste time downloading 16 gb of this crap...
1016	0	a	not that good of a game...
1017	0	a	Help  Games runs extremly laggy and slow, I been running on Full screen 1080P vsync on and off.  I7-4790K 2xR9 270X 4G  
1018	0	a	NO  IT IS ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T
1019	0	a	Ok its graphics are good but as soon as I got in a race I coulden't move. So then I checked the controls and they were are broken. So I had to rebind everything and finally got to drive. As soon as I got started driving the steering SUCKED. So then finally I looked for other cars and I saw only a few free cars and they all have terrible steering.
1020	0	a	This game forces my computer to run using integrated graphics causing it to run terribly. And so many microtransactions making the game unplayable
1021	0	a	Just another free to play game that isnt free to play - you download a huge amount of data to race a few cars and even fewer tracks - Its not even a good sim (I never felt that RACE07 was a good sim, and this just has the same problems, multiplied). The cars have way too much grip and way too much oversteer - braking is always assisted and the cars are far too stable to feel like racing cars. Unless you have deep pockets, suck at racing sims, and want to feel like youre accomplishing something, just steer clear of this one (no pun intended).
1022	0	a	Graphics are nice, but driving mechanics sucks. This is a racing game... the driving mechanics should not suck, also the car sounds are not good, they should invest more on some better car sounds.
1023	0	a	I really want to like this one, but it is simply released to the public way too early. The graphics are okay, but the colors are weird, especially in terms of sky and lighting. I also experience graphics glitches like flickering shadows or polygons and the complete cockpit disappearing for a fraction of a second on some parts of the sweden hillclimb track. Soundwise, the game is relatively good. But I find some motor sounds extremely annoying and overdone. The physics are good enough for a sim, but the force feedback currently is just wrong. It doesn't reflect the movement on screen too well, which makes driving kinda confusing. The UI simply needs a huge overhaul. The overall feeling of product quality is pretty low, when you experience things like the whole menu freezing and having to kill two ingame browser processes to make it work again. The amount of free content is a joke, while the cars are okay, the two tracks aren't. Currently, the amount of available tracks to buy is too low, and important ones like the Nordschleife are missing. The pricing policy on the content overall is an impudence.  I know that it is work in progress, but it doesn't even feel like a solid beta to me. If you are looking for great PC sim racing, you'll get the best overall package with Race07 / Race Injection and its extensions. Lots of good content, good physics and force feedback, a finished and great product for a low amount of money. And if you are really into physics and graphics are not important to you, I recommend rFactor 2. It is still in development, which moves on pretty slowly in terms of content, but it has the most advanced physics simulation and very solid force feedback plus a great AI. If you want DTM, DTM Racedriver 3 will give you much more value than the DTM Experience addon for RaceRoom. And if you want the best multiplayer racing experience, well - people seem to love iRacing (but I haven't checked that out).
1024	0	a	Where to start....  For one, you only get 5 out of the 38 cars for free. The rest, you have to buy. Now, maybe this wouldn't be nearly as bad if you could actually choose the cars, but no. You're stuck with what they've already chosen, which means you could end up driving in a class of cars that you might not want two.  Secondly, ona similiar topic, you get 2 generic free tracks out of 14.  Third.I couldn't find a way to rebind keyboard controls. The handling system felt off as such. (I know this is supposed to be played with a wheel and pedals, but I've played plenty of sims without. rFactor 1 and 2, other SimBin titles, Assetto Corsa, etc.) The UI was pretty bad as well.
1025	0	a	Sorry, but no. The UI is all over the place--it is easy to tell that it was designed for a steering wheel, but why does the main menu look like a messy CS:GO buy menu?, the game's overall atmosphere, the levels and lack of sound effects (other than the exagerated car noises)--makes the game feel lonely and soulless--even the in-game messages feel robotic. and remind me of The Office when Dwight makes a birthday banner that simply reads, 'It is your birthday.', and finally the fact that any other car or track other than the one they give you is prompted with a overlay to purchase in-game funds make this game feel like a cash grab. Sad.
1026	0	a	cant even get the activation code in my eamail, they even have problems sending email to the users
1027	0	a	Holy crap only a few cars and only 1 track I believe. And mostly you buy stuff. Dont waste your time with this game
1028	0	a	The Graphics are horrid 
1029	0	a	Like ♥♥♥♥.all must pay. but the sound in nice
1030	0	a	I.....I don't know where to begin. First it lags. I've got 4 GB RAM and it lags at the most important moments in the race. I tried everything. Game Booster, restarting the PC, everything. Second, the AI sucks. Those guys are crashing you and they're not even trying to avoid you. The game would be super cool if it wouldn't lag, that's for sure. AI is not a problem, just sometimes. So try you guys to solve the lag problem and maybe I will change my review about this game.
1031	0	a	DISCLAIMER: I DO reconmend this game if you are using a single screen setup.  I have been a huge fan of the SimBin PC games through the years, and R3E definitely has the feel that I like and a great roster of cars and tracks. I am not a fan of the pricing scheme they've got set up for it however... Also, if you have triple screens, don't even bother unless you want to play with distorted fish eye effect. They won't bother to add multi-view like every other decent sim. Maybe one day I'll be able to enjoy this game the way i'd like to.
1032	0	a	I downloaded this game with the hope that it would be a decent play. After dicking about registering with far too much information, I managed to navigate the horrific menu and get into game. I was then greeted with a lovely CTD, no problem, I'll check my drivers and try again. After several attempts and a bit of research I tried running in windowed mode, which worked! I finally get in game and then the real disappointment set in, the handling is terrible, the physics (what physics) are broken and it just doesn't feel right; you shouldn't have to pretty much switch the enging off to negotiate a slight bend in the road. Even using a controller, it appears that the controls are pretty much off or flat out, which brings me to my next point. This game just isn't optimised for controller use, seriously, controlling a cursor with a stick just shouldnt' even be considered by any devs any more.   Other people seem to be complaining about the content. I haven't had the patience to fully explore it yet, although I will keep it installed and give it another chance on another day.
1033	0	a	Physics are completely un-responsive, and the car's always feel like you are driving on slime and the car slides everywhere, thank you for creating a game where I can re-live the physics of racing games from the windows 95 area that whenever it rained on a track I would slip and side everywhere even when doing twenty miles an hour.
1034	0	a	Worst game in the world for racing , the steering is really bad you cant even drive the car. Dont bother !!!1
1035	0	a	good thing its free, your car slows down before turns even if you dont want it too, it nearly stops for no reason, also if you barely turn it completly spins you out
1036	0	a	this game is absolute crap ive had mobile games for free better than this
1037	0	a	welcome to warm butter on melting ice simulator! where, unless you have a million ♥♥♥♥ing pounds to spend on racing simulator full experience controls, you 'drift' into every ♥♥♥♥ing thing in the game. the controls for mouse and keyboard are so bad that i couldn't evenmove untill i changed the controls. even the control settings are ♥♥♥♥, you have to double click what you want to change and then click one of the buttons it actually recognises: all mouse buttons excluded. good thing this peice of ♥♥♥♥ is free, because if i had to spend £15 on this then i might have to accidentally slip and fall on to a ♥♥♥♥ing wall of chainsaws multiple times. (dont question that) the graphics might be ok; i wouldn't know. because it takes a ♥♥♥♥ing supercomputer to run decent graphics. if you have a super computer and/or full experience racing controls, then this game may be for you! if not, i advise you not to waste your time. TLDR: if you have a computer layout alike to normal humans, DONT. if you are a millionare with everything, on your own head be it.
1038	0	a	This game really is a piece of crap, take too long to load, the steering wheel does not work, just one car and a track, I definitely do not recommend it.
1039	0	a	Ok its graphics are good but as soon as I got in a race I coulden't move. So then I checked the controls and they were are broken. So I had to rebind everything and finally got to drive. As soon as I got started driving the steering SUCKED. So then finally I looked for other cars and I saw only a few free cars and they all have terrible steering.

9457	1	a	This game has a kinda mix of Project Cars and Forza Motoersport 4. For a Realistic-Racing game, I recommend it. For a Racing game, I don't. It just it isn't an open-world experience that I thought. I love the Forza series, iRacing and Project Cars, but this game is more of a non-casual racing game. In my opinion I give it a 7.1/10 for Low-End Performence and Game wise.
1075	0	a	how do you like dem microtransactions?!
1076	0	a	Don't bother unless you have money to spend on tracks and cars

1079	0	a	This Game Have Good Graphic And Track But, Suck Gameplay  Not Recommended
9459	1	a	Going to change my review to positive. I love the graphics, they are simply the best in the industry. This game take SKILL. I mean that! Not that I have that much, but I'm practicing and getting better a little more and more everyday. Also I think I like the 'BUY AS YOU NEED', model. This way you don't get a bunch of stuff you don't need or want. This applies to cars, tracks and liveries. Seting up a controller takes time and patience. This is definately a game for mature individuals. Not that I am very mature, this game is a good teacher also, what can I say....lol A big thank you for the devolopers!!! I GET IT!!  Peter
9461	1	a	+1
1086	0	a	It's a good game and all, but the startup GUI is nasty and everything is a HUGE learning curve and if you want a Forza game on the PC for free, this works, I guess...
1087	0	a	It would be really nice if the game, you know, came with all of the content. It would be even better if it didn't crash whenever you try to start a race. But other than the fact that it is basically unplayable, I'm sure it would be a fun game. Sorry, but it's a no from me.
9463	1	a	Nice but to expensive for a free game
1094	0	a	So dissapointed! I try to disable auto clutch and it doesn't work... Where is my freedom! I literally have no control over the braking at corners and it is extremely annoying!

1101	0	a	It's the worst game i've ever played ,it crashes al the time few seconds in the game *boof* crash every ♥♥♥♥ing time
1102	0	a	The only thing free about this game is the screen glitching. you cant even tune the one car they give you to drive
1103	0	a	If you want to drive a car around a track then this game is for you.  If you however want a multiplayer racing game, with good physics, good interface and overall a good experience that's worth the space it takes in storage. Don't get this game.  Recommended for: People who have enough money to spend on virtual cars in a 'free to play' game, instead of an actual game that's worth how much you payed for it.
1104	0	a	look if you wanna get this game might as well get the 50 dollar 1 its way better and cheaper
1105	0	a	just like I RACING GOT TO buy tracks and cars not good. This will cost hundreds of dollars, it's only a game , not a living!
1106	0	a	Why does this game needs my origin country and my birth date?
1107	0	a	This is one of the worst racing games I ever played! I believe that the physics are really bad and the graphics. I had delted the game after a certain amount of time. The only good thing is that it's free!
1108	0	a	Awful game. took ages to download and graphics are disgraceful. Made to much of a big deal out of it
1109	0	a	Bad game fps is pretty bad and i dont like how there are only a few cars to use in the game 
1110	0	a	Let me start by saying I really wanted to like this game. Let me also say I am not opposed to paying for good quality games. That being said I am a HUGE Iracing fan, which is hands down the best race sim ever made. Iracing is also expensive as each car and each track costs money and it's a subscription service. The differenece here is they are up frnot about what you will need to pay, this game is microtransaction hell. It's very confusing and when you do figure it out your looking at hundreds of dollars. So right there I lost interest, and I didn't even get to the bad joke they call realistic physics. Anyone that thinks this game is realistic has never actually driven a car on a track. If you can play the game with a mouse and keyboard it is not realistic. There is no way you could control a car with a mouse at freeway speeds let alone in a race.
1111	0	a	It was good previously un recently it keeps on crashed, crashed &amp; crashed. Can't even play. And every little things need to pay, pay and pay.
1112	0	a	I cant turn only a little bit but i always crash
1113	0	a	I cannot get it work :( I know I'm on windows 10 but COME ON!

1119	0	a	It's good but TOO PAY TO WIN!!!!!!!!!!
1120	0	a	Downloaded game excited to try it out and nothing....locks up every time and can't get past loading screen. Running 980ti's in SLI and supposedly it's an SLI/xfire issue. Fix your sheet people!
1121	0	a	free2play? pah only if you want rubbish cars and limited tracks, want anything good? then you have to pay 
1122	0	a	Don't be fooled by the false advertising, this is not a free to play title. What you download is actually more of a demo, as the game is filled with microtransactions. Too bad, because the game is actually pretty good but ruined with bad pricing model.  I would be more than happy if I could actually buy the game instead of being milked with microtransactions. Don't waste your bandwidth.  You are better of waiting for something like Project cars or Assetto corsa.
1123	0	a	it is a good base game ruined by expensive microtransactions and no multiplayer still. the cars handle good , graphics are good, performance is good , sounds are good. works on g25 and i suppose on all popular wheels. at the time of this review with no multiplayer and the expensive microtransactions that will have you paying WAY over $60 for a few tracks and cars, i cannot recommend it.
1124	0	a	Claims to be free, but has locked DLC content.
1125	0	a	This game is not a driving simulator, so you can buy it if you don't like simulators. If you drive in RaceRoom, you drive cars without grip, as if there was soap on tracks.
1126	0	a	this game cant go race. it just can go time attack
1127	0	a	The game feels very cheap, I couldn't change from controller back to keyboard and the controls in general are poorly chosen. Also there are limited FREE cars most you have to pay for.
1128	0	a	Doesn't Work good on my AlienWere Gaming Laptop and my laptop runs very good
1129	0	a	bad game dont get it beacause the singleplayer stinks dont spand money on this stupid game
1130	0	a	This is the most expensive 'free to play' game I ever wasted my time downloading. Nice job. Don't spend all that money you're earning in one place. I'll take my business elsewhere.  
1131	0	a	After a a 10 minute registration and the 2hour download I got into the game where there was no FOV so i felt like I was playing through a 2x microscope and to be able to control your car is impossible in itself. There is no videos settings either. I GIVE THIS A 0.25/100. NOT RECCOMENDED!
1132	0	a	This game is ♥♥♥♥ing crap I would not recommend this game 0/10 sounds is poor and controls are usless if it were on CD/DVD I would use the disc as a coster.
1133	0	a	♥♥♥♥ this game
1134	0	a	IT WONT LAUNCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1135	0	a	extremly hard to controll without controller i did not use a controller but with mouse and keyboard its impossible
1136	0	a	make the graphics like the videos or dont make a video for it at all you ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥
1137	0	a	Dont get it waste of time and it ask for info they should not need to know even if you fill it out they say they'll send you a code but you'll never get it
1138	0	a	10/10 Would delete again.
1139	0	a	The free version of the game has only 2 or 3 cars and only 2 tracks and I had to download 10GB for that! The game is very nice but you have to pay to have more cars and tracks.
1140	0	a	Garbage Physics. Not free to play if you actually want any content whatsoever. You start with 3 ♥♥♥♥♥ cars and 3 ♥♥♥♥♥ tracks. Move along...
1141	0	a	Not a good game atm. Controls are too clunky, making it difficult to drive.
1142	0	a	cant connect to server error 503 it sucks men 
1143	0	a	Free to Play in the sense that they give you a track and a car. Really more like a demo, then a real f2p. Cash Grab.
1144	0	a	Total rip off. you must pay for every single car and track, an still there is not much content, and you only can race alone on the track. the graphics are not up to date.. and the feeling of the cars is not so much realistic, rFactor 1 is still better than this. or BETTER look at ASSETTO CORSA !!! 
1145	0	a	♥♥♥♥♥♥♥
1146	0	a	Can't control a car on a decent way. Bad sound. 10 min playing and now i deleting it.
1147	0	a	Removed due to a 5.8GB update.
1148	0	a	for an F2P: only hot laps, no racing, only 3 cars, game seems to be running on Race 07's engine, and driving feels too slidy 0/5 stars
1149	0	a	Can Not do anything. do not download it
1150	0	a	Possibly the worst game I've ever played. It runs fine on my PC, but the game is just terrible. If you accelarate too quickly it waill spinout. If you go off-course, 'invalid lap' shows and you have to restart. The controls that you start off with are not like the normal WSAD. Instead, its the arrow keys. I have no idea how this is 8GB on my HDD so I would just wait for the Devs to fix everything wrong, then I would download this game.
1151	0	a	This game told me it was going to take 3 hours max to download. It took 10. Don't download this even though it is free as every time one wheel touches the corner it makes the lap invalid. Remember guys, free is not always good
1152	0	a	contrlling sucks,  hard to get around as a newbie expensive, unlike another game here that is free2play but awesome this doesn't give you anything 'free'  graphics suck did i mention controlling sucks? no, just nooo
1153	0	a	Worst game i have ever played.. Totoal waist
1154	0	a	I CANT EVEN PLAY THE GAME!? This game was.....OK when I got it before about the time it came out. But I now got it back and it gives me an error when I try to play the game. So I dont know why but from what I hear now, I dont even want it.
1155	0	a	i can't play the game
1156	0	a	aful game i play on the side and can't even see nothing and plus my racing wheel is turning to sides fix it fast

1162	0	a	Well I thought Origin asked too much (aka EA) when it comes to their microstransactions for all their games. While the client for the game might be free for Raceroom. The rest of the cars and tracks (you get a handful for free) cost approx $3/$5 respecitvely. Mind you it is just 1 Model of Car, not variations, like all BMW's M Class. Now the tracks probably are reasonable, but I have not bought 1 to see just how close to the real thing they are. If they are like the included tracks that you get for free, I might be able to see buying a track. Right now you can probably with the Easter Sale pick up 4-5 cars for around $6, tracks maybe 2 for the same $6.   Note, if you have money in your Steam Wallet, you can convert them to the currency used to buy the tracks and cars.  So I would wait and see if they do any really special promotion with multiple cars for a low price. The DTM package, has 3 cars, with multiple paint schemes/team versions, but I don't know if that is really worthwhile. They do include several tracks in the package. So for right now, with the game still, sort, in a beta to release candidate status, depends on who you talk to and what you consider aa final release. But you can clearly see they state 'Open Beta' as of April 10, 2014.

1166	0	a	Slow response time for vehicles. Poor organization. Very user UN-friendly. Uninstalled.
1167	0	a	Nice Demo...when does the full game come out?
1168	0	a	I probably had the less fun playing this game than any other racing game to date.   I booted up the game and ended up waiting about 7 hours for the confirmation email to come so that I could activate my account and actually log into the game. This is the reason for my 8 hours of play time while I left the game minimized while waiting for the email to come.   I was finally able to log in and was bombarded with the cluster-**** of a menu. There didn't seem to me to be any sort of rhyme or reason to how the menu was set up and the not-so-large amount of content was masked behind a seemingly endless menu, which was all locked behind a paywall anyway.   Once I got into what seemed to be the only track available to me, in what seemed to be the only car available to me, it took me a while to get used to not using a racing line in a game. After ten laps or so I was finally able to race around the track decently quick but was conitinuing to be annoyed by the way the game played.   The physics seemed decent enough, but as far as being any fun.. it felt completely stale and uninteresting to me. The only track available for free didn't appeal to me at all and I didn't care too much for the car either. I was using a controller to race and the game still just felt really rigid, stiff and so unexciting that after a couple more laps I decided that I was done with it.   The final product just felt to me.. well.. free. They put a lot of focus on making the game seem quite real. The game definitely has a unique feel to it that you notice all the way through, but I wasn't going to give any of it a chance when the racing itself just left me bored.  It kinda feels like a free version of Gran Turismo. Except.. not fun.. or good... From head to toe, it's just absolutely not visceral or exciting in the slightest.
1169	0	a	this game is a dishonor to race07.
1170	0	a	SO HARD TO CONTROL! DON'T EVEN PLAY IT ANYMORE!!!!
1171	0	a	This game sucks I tryed to start a race several times, but it never started. So after 5 minutes I uninstalled the game.
1172	0	a	Games Alright for a eacing game and it does have some free cars. Thats the good.  The bad is the menu system is garbage. The servers are hard to join and the races are laggy. The multiplayer is dead. good game, dumb design.  Better off buying a game that you can host your own servers, or atleast have local servers running.
1173	0	a	wont even let me login to their servers, DO NOT DOWNLOAD, LAME AS HELL
1174	0	a	just like I RACING GOT TO buy tracks and cars not good. This will cost hundreds of dollars, it's only a game , not a living!
1175	0	a	Why does this game needs my origin country and my birth date?
1176	0	a	This is one of the worst racing games I ever played! I believe that the physics are really bad and the graphics. I had delted the game after a certain amount of time. The only good thing is that it's free!
1177	0	a	Pros: -great sounds -great simulation feeling -cool camera tossing, depending on driving surface  Cons: -not Free2play! The content is on a Demo level. You can not unlock any content for free. -you have to buy every single piece of content...  -no multiplayer yet  Comment: Purchaching all tracks will cost you about 40eur and all cars will cost you about 15eur, at this given time. Graphics are not impressive, but they are still decent.  If you want to try out all the cars and tracks, this game will not exacly be a fair deal. In that case you are probably better of with another simulation racing game.
1178	0	a	Mighta been a good game I will never know, wouldn't respond to the contoller keyboard or mouse all which work on every other game I have. Read other reviews before diving in on this one.
1179	0	a	Feels a lot like a demo, only two tracks in free2play, no multiplayer modes and even the simulation mode has to be paid for. If you search for a satisfying racing sim, I recommend GTR Evolution.
1180	0	a	♥♥♥♥ 
1181	0	a	I was having a problem with closing the game..
1182	0	a	I have played this for over a week now &amp; can say that I like the driving feel on the circuits especially in keep it real mode (or whatever its called) Once you get the steering settings right its real good. Hillclimb mode however is basically crap. It simulates way to much speed &amp; doesnt feel real at all. Graphics are smooth &amp; look great, the sounds are top notch right down to the gear change exhaust pops to the race brake squeels. The dissapointment hits when you find you have 1 circuit &amp; a handfull of cars to play &amp; everything else costs. The online challenges from what I can see mainly revolve around the DTM Experience DLC which you have to pay for (think its 34.99US) When you consider the latest Grid Autosport is $49.99US on steam &amp; offers a widened track, car &amp; game mode variety including multiplayer, I think maybe a better option.  That said, I am yet to play Grid Autosport and am basing my thoughts on heresay.  In all, Race room is refined in circuit mode but lacks depth without putting your hand in your pockets.

1197	0	a	I hate it its stupid
1198	0	a	Terrible game, poor control, full of bugs. Support team is even worse, spent months dealing with them on one single issue. Still blown away at how insane the situation played out.
1199	0	a	I wouldn't waste the time to download this game, the controls are very sluggish, and this game is screaming pay to win in the future. To top it off this game though free to play only has a couple of singleplayer modes without ai, or other people. To get access to anything in the game you better have deep pockets because almost everything is considered dlc and you cant use it unless you pay real $. Also the ui's and menus feel very clunky and somewhat overly complex. Hopefully the dev's will fix some of these issues,but for right now i wouldnt waste the time. 3/10
1200	0	a	Although this game has rather excellent graphics, a simple menu and control board, it lacks explanation. Upon downloading and playing the game, I understood the controls and my objectives. However, upon completing the practice course under the guidelines I was given, I was lost as to what to do next. I tried pretty much every button and tab and either it said it was locked or I must purchase it. Another problem was that, for such a free game, there was so much and too much to purchase. They should have just made it for purchase instead of making it free and making and infinite amount of content purchasble. I was disappointed.
1201	0	a	Waste of time, don't buy
1202	0	a	Good game, not bad that you can initially get it for free, but it has a classic part that you really need to buy the pack to make the game worth it, far too much is not available in the free part. Gameplay is not quite as I expected and I feel that GT Legends by simbin and even GTR Evolution played much better, this has a real arcade feel not simulation.   All in all, not bad for a bash but certainly wont buy the pack to unlock everything.
1203	0	a	crap free to play model
1204	0	a	Massive issues just getting registered, makes you fill out a form and is meant to return a email to you and doesn't , then on the site in the choice to resend acctivation email it asks for home address phone number blood type , ok so I made the blood type part up , but why all these personal details are required I don't know.  been round and round trying to fix this , including following the link in steam from simbin and still nothing.  So I can't review it only my attempts to get the game working, which is not happening.
1205	0	a	The most fake racing simulator i played....
1206	0	a	Simly doesn't work right.  Started the game and added my controler, it detected it well, but made me map everything myself. Using a Xbox One controller which works fine on everything else.  So of course some things can't be mapped correctly, and when I try to race, it doesnt let me use the controller for a few seconds so I often start crashed into a wall, then the controlling is terriable.
1207	0	a	I am having too many game issues to give it a 'thumbs up' recommendation. For the moment I must vote 'thumbs down.' If the game and business model improves I will revisit my recommendation. imho,ymmv : )  edit updated 10/15/2015 after ~7 additional months... This game is still in beta after 30 months from release date of February 2013!!   I am currently run the ADC pack, DTM 2014 pack and WTCC 2014 pack in RaceRoom beta.  Many improvements have been made in the past few months. However, I still cannot give it a 'thumbs up' recommendation at this time.  On the positive side the FWD cars in the WTCC 2014 pack are simply lovely to drive. Good handling and excellent FFB make for a plenty of enjoyment taking these cars around any track. The awful GUI is gone!    Items that need to be addressed by Sector3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) - AI is decent and quite clean by having good player detection coding.  AI aggressiveness needs to be added to game.  AI are 'on the rails' when it comes to collisions - your car is not on the rails so if there is a collision between you and AI then you will likely spin out and the AI will continue running. AI needs more options and settings to make them more realistic and less automated.  Business model - Having items and picks split between S3 store and STEAM is simply awful. S3 needs to have all of the items available for sale grouped together. S3 needs to dump the VRP and only list currency.  S3 servers - Having two sets of authentication (steam and S3 servers) is redundant and causes more issues for end user. S3, dump your servers so players can still play RRRE if your servers are down, steam is down, or if players internet is down.  There appears to be no option to calibrate wheels and pedals in game. My gear was recognized and works well. However, I want to calibrate my pedals (set a small deadzone at start and set the travel of when I hit 100% of throttle or brake) and the game will not allow the user to do it. S3 needs to add in a calibration function like the one used in iracing or rf2.   Overall, it appears to me as if S3 has been working on building out the available cars and tracks and only recently are starting to focus on adding in features and updating features already in the game.  Ouch! As of today the game only has a 53% approval rating! : (
1208	0	a	you must pay to do most things 
1209	0	a	This game looked like fun, so I downloaded it. WORST GAME EVER! I have a few problems with this game. #1 I have a decent computer and can run racing games at about medium visual settings. This game i had to lower it to lowest settings and it still lagged a lot. #2 I use a x-box 360 controller with most of my games. this game it kept saying that my joystick was pulling left. I checked it with my x-box and it was fine. I tried with a keyboard but bad control and lag made it super bad for racing. #3 When I wanted to stop this highway to hell , it wouldn't let me. I tried for 15 minutes to get out of the game and it would just do nothing. Its like they don't want you to quit this POS. All together I would give this game a -2.5 out of 10.
1210	0	a	alright so i figured i'll gave this raceing game a try and i will say it first the game has good decent graphic if you have to good high end or mid rage pc with a quad care and a @ GB or higher GPU with 8 GB Ram sticks but this is a raceing sim and i like some raceing sim games but this one imo is terrablie first let me say i dont own any kind of racing wheel for pc or consoles ok and secondly i ws useing keyborad but all man i feel bad for the bad driveing physic that are in this game and i will these driveing meancanes are worst then anot other racing sim i have played ever if your a big racing sim and have a racing wheel then i would strongly suggest this game but if you did not own a racing wheel of any kind Don't play this game and by th eway this not a free-to-play neither it's a pay to play like most Free-To-play games out there and to the Developers and pubishs if this game I'm sorry but you guys could of then a Much Better job on this game serious like i sand before i have played better racing sims then this game
1211	0	a	I CANT EVEN PLAY THE GAME!? This game was.....OK when I got it before about the time it came out. But I now got it back and it gives me an error when I try to play the game. So I dont know why but from what I hear now, I dont even want it.
1212	0	a	i can't play the game
1213	0	a	This game is horrible
1214	0	a	Its a free game, obviously, and you can always tell it free. I don't recommend this game at all because everytime I try to log in, there is an error saying 'No Server Connection'. I have full internet connection and i can connect to anything else but this. So far, this game is not impressing!!
1215	0	a	decent game but not for my taste... 4/10
1216	0	a	Wow, that was a bad experience. The interface is confusing, the race modes are all locked unless you pay for them, and the controls are the worst I've ever seen. I've raced before, in real life, and it is nothing like this. This one needs an overhaul.
1217	0	a	8 GB for 1 race track is more than a little too much,. i'm guessing all the DLC is included from the start off. It's a cool game to play and the handling is pretty decent - and it has external wheel and pedal support at least.   It's not bad. But hardly great either. I just have it installed because I don't have any other games that support the wheel. In order for this to really be worth recommending, it'd need a few more tracks, and MUCH cheaper car/extra track unlocks.  There's some bugs where you drive through obstacles, and get disqualified for ranking a time on that lap - you have to keep driving the whole lap before that flag resets,.. it's a bit frustrating.
1218	0	a	how to use wheel???? 
1219	0	a	NOT GOOD. Incredible bad steering (with a wheel). It's free but... just not my cup of coffee.
1220	0	a	The game was fun, but it ask too much for a computer, even a good one. The control are ok, but it having too much options and it pretty hard to memorize 30+ commands here, if you don't have a racing wheel for your computer, you're going to taste the wall all the time. It could be fun to see a gameplay that is keyboard friendly here, because the game seem to force you to buy a racing wheel.   The graphics are great, the 3D models of the cars are amazing, and a lots of polygon are on them, but since they have a huge numbers of polygon, like I said before, even a good computer will suffer from video lagging. Frequent framerate drop also happen a lot(even during the loading screen)! Also, I feel a lot of time that the game look unfinished...  Another thing here is the loading time, you will have so much time to cook a dinner since it took so much time to load!!!!  The sound is ok, but I don't feel like I'm sitting in a racecar(I have a subwoofer, still, the sound have no bass sound). The motor sound flat, and not like a 'ROAR'!!!!  The main menu isn't friendly at all, since with the new update, I got much more trouble to start a race than before, oh, and the stuff that need to be bought, like cars and tracks are not identified correctly...  Another thing that not cool is to play online, you need to buy the DTM experience pack, isn't the game supposed to be free???  I do not recommend this game for gamers that never played racing simulator before, but give it a try, maybe you will like it, maybe not.  I prefer other racing simulator like Gran Turismo or Live For Speed(and LFS is keyboard friendly), but Raceroom Racing Experience is not a game, it a demo with extremely limited content if you don't buy the DTM experience... Search farther on Steam for a good racing simulator, but don't spend any money on this...
1221	0	a	I CAN'T EVEN GET ON, IT SAID THAT IT SENT AN EMAIL WHEN I TRIED TO REGISTER, WHEN I CHECKED MY EMAIL 5 MINUTES LATER THERE WAS NOTHING ABOUT THIS GAME AND NOW I CAN'T REGISTER AGAIN BECAUSE I ALREADY USED MY EMAIL! I'M ENRAGED

1240	0	a	This game is terrible do not waste your time on it! i tried to select several different tracks and every time i got done with the loading screen it always took me back to the same ONE track i played 5 times, If you want a racing Experience pickup GT4 or Forza4 or Shift 2. Thisis just awful, the controls dont feel that responsive as they should be. Avoid this.
1241	0	a	Single player game, I have to wonder why the developers took time to create this game. Takes forever to load and unload. The game control is OK but the single player is worthless. I was hoping for much more when I instlled RaceRoom but didn't get it. If it ever becomes a multi-player game I'll take a second look although now I can not tell anyone to bother with it.
1242	0	a	After initially being very impressed by this game, after slow and stale development is has slowly lost its charm and now is left in other racing sims dust.   SimBin are now masters of empty promises, maybes and excuses. Stay away from this game.
1243	0	a	Although I don't play many driving games, those that I do play provide an interface that allows you to drive the cars.  This game's controls are so hyper that I could do nothing but smash from side to side on the track.
1244	0	a	I can't turn good, every car has hard turning, I was expecting turning that would turn easier and make a turn at 45-89 MPH.
1245	0	a	this game has a good foundation but it's steering is actually unmanagable. This is someone to work on before it becomes a recommendable game.

1279	0	a	its says i am missing files idk ive looked every where to fix it but its no working for me so can someone help me i mis dll files ?
9467	1	a	I liked it . it's a little arcade but it a lot of fun to race. so just for good racing Ill give it a thumbs up
9469	1	a	RaceRoom... This game has a really good concept to it. It is about 20GB's big which means it has alot to it. It has alot of maps, and you can play online which makes it nice. The game is complicated as ♥♥♥♥ when you first start, but it gets easier. Finally found a good racing game for PC, it is also really good on FPS. Anyone can run it, trust me.  11/9 would play again
1280	0	a	if you are looking for a casual racing games not to bothered about building up your car collection get it but if you want to build your car collection don't play this because for all cars you want from the shop you have to pay and they should just make you pay for the game and then you pay for cars with in game credits
1281	0	a	4.2 Hours of accidental afk, Woops!

1283	0	a	Long story short, this game sucks.
9471	1	a	Nice but bad. 
1301	0	a	Horible game, the best part was unistalling it!
1302	0	a	Free hillclimb map had a disqualifying bug. This is a money pit, even worse then iRacing since the content does not justify it in my opinion.  The good however is that the car sounds are EXCELLENT! Physics seems good as well.   Overall I prefer Assetto Corsa, this is not for me.
1303	0	a	This was a very fun sim. Now doesnt even load. Terrible service especially for people that have paid content.,
1304	0	a	  I would not suggest this game to anyone, I love racing games, both simulation and arcade but this one, it's just too bad it decided to be a free2play game instead of a real game. It doesn't have many cars and tracks for a game that is supposed to be updated often. You have to pay for the stuff and it's overpriced, give me a all in one pack that will also contains all future content for a fair price then that would be good but unfortunately, it is not the case, you can see that the developer is just one other among the incompetents and greedy sheep of the modern gaming industry. As I can understand, if you buy one car, you can only choose one livery but I am unsure about that so do not totally trust me about this one. It is probably one of the only racing game that has DTM, the only one that I am aware of but when it comes to WTCC you're better off with RACE - The WTCC Game and GTR for GT. I'll be honest, the difficulty is pretty though, pretty much harder than every single rally games I have played (almost all of them), harder than F1 games and harder than pretty much everything, maybe that I am not used to this kind of racing (DTM), I'd love to but I hate how their game works, sell the game then that's it, no microtransactions, no in-store content or at least, make us able to buy a bundle that has everything in it and that would also contain everything in the future and no crap such as what Ubisoft did - selling a season pass then selling an 'expansion' that you have to buy even if you own the season pass. Other than that, the graphics are great but the worse point of this game is that it has no offline mode.    In short.  Negative:  1. No offline mode. 2. Overpriced content. 3. No bundle that has everying in it for a fair price. 4. Does not have a lot of content for a game that is supposed to be updated often.   Positive:  1. Great difficulty. 2. Great maneuverability/gameplay. 3. Great graphics (even If honestly, I do not care too much about the graphics as long as it is all the same everywhere unlike some games in particular).  Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this game because of its big flaws.  4/10
1305	0	a	Rubbish controls, rubbish cars!
1306	0	a	Complete dogshit, waste of time. The controls are terrible.
1307	0	a	Just buy F1 2013/2012
1308	0	a	The cars are unresponsive and overall like driving drunk 10x. I would not ever recommend this to any because of the fact they might hate me forever for doing so. -5/5
1309	0	a	A couple cars, couple variations of the same track and a large amount of mini-transactions.  Kudos to SimBin to allow you to drive more than one car instead of buying them, although the rest are for real money. It has some potential to be a fun racing simulator, but I can already see that SimBin only wants your money.  I must say, it is pretty fun for the first couple minutes, until you look at the store, ALL cars are for real money, nothing you can earn by playing; A career would of kept me playing.  If you are intrested in these types of games, spend your money on Assetto Corsa - A amazing game, definitely recommend it - Instead of this milking factory.   Not worth 10gb of storage space.  3.5/10
1310	0	a	never waste ur life on this peice of ♥♥♥♥ all uu do is spin out when u drive i waited 3h wiht slow internet for this ♥♥♥♥ truly ♥♥♥♥ unrealisktik as ♥♥♥♥ all u do is spin around and fly allover teh track and u cant get basicly anything without paying never download not free its freemium 0/10 = ♥♥♥♥t
1311	0	a	Gameplay completely unrealistic !
1312	0	a	I honestly don't know why people love this game so much. It's BAD. The frame rate is awful, and the steering is just HORRIBLE. I press the right arrow ONCE and I spun out! This game is not good. Don't be fooled by the reviews. If you're looking for a good racing game, try Trackmania.
1313	0	a	A very very ♥♥♥♥ed up game that pisses on every thing you know about racing games and implements a new mecanic that ♥♥♥♥♥ all over you.A very very bad game.♥♥♥♥ this game.

1315	0	a	This game appears good at first but quickly became a money swolowing pile of ♥♥♥♥♥ Do download is but do not give these people any money for this pay-to-win crap
1316	0	a	Motion blur is way too much, even with it disabled. Handling is unrealistic and difficult. Circuits suck. Not recommended.
1317	0	a	Absolutley no point to this game unless youre a really big formula 1 racer fanatic. its basically a simulation with 95% of all content is pay to play
1318	0	a	.
1319	0	a	This actually the only good free racing game in steam but my complaint is the control detection kinda buggy and the control profile also kind of confusing, I'm using xbox 360 controller, the game able to detect but does nothing. Fix the control detection and would recommend this game...
1320	0	a	Would not recommend this game as it has terrible controls
1321	0	a	Wow Howoverly unrealistic can you be? I bumped a car from behind and in UNDER 0.25s it finished a 360. Now I understand the need for realism in racing, its actually fun. But that isnt real at all.  Also you try to learn the game? It teaches you by throwing you head first into a super over unrealistic race where braking and cornering at the same time isnt bad... its IMPOSSIBLE. Yes when you race you don't want to do that, thats a given. But if you brake and turn you dont slow down at 1kilometre per second........ (just so you know it would take 300seconds to stop if you turn and break on the first corner of single race default) Which is completely unrealistic......  If you like realism in driving games Play Need for speed ITS BETTER THAN THIS ♥♥♥♥!
1322	0	a	Auto-brake will drive you crazy but this game drives you crazy with it, and I almost couldn't pick a car because the game wants you to buy everything. Then it told me to register for free content and ten minutes later when I signed in I got 1 car. Then you have to adjust every setting in the UI because all the normal stuff just isnt there. On top of that it is super over complicated just to get a car and drive it. The single player mode has confusing menus too, that was nice. So much potential for a game this big, over 10gb, but it falls short in all the worst ways.
1323	0	a	Can't reccomend. Don't waste your time to even download this game. It's a crap!
1324	0	a	this game suck

1328	0	a	Played when it first came out, uninstalled the game till i can wait for better playable mode.  Installed again to play with friends, everyone yelled at me for making them DL this game.  Uninstalled for the 2nd time because with alot of updates you still only use like 1 car to pick from.  If you are looking for something to play with friends just DON'T DL THIS S**T GAME!
1329	0	a	I honestly don't know why people love this game so much. It's BAD. The frame rate is awful, and the steering is just HORRIBLE. I press the right arrow ONCE and I spun out! This game is not good. Don't be fooled by the reviews. If you're looking for a good racing game, try Trackmania.
1330	0	a	I dont recommend this game, in my opinion doesnt have real physics and it feels like its closed, you dont have freedom to use maximal potential of cars.
1331	0	a	You may ask yourself about this review, that this dude couldn't possibly know what he's talking about, he hasn't even played a full 30 minutes! Actually, I played 0 minutes. Because I couldn't get to play. Here, is why.   [I have also, a link at the bottom of this review, to show you visually what I went through.]  Firstly, on start up, my mouse cursor goes straight up to top of screen at a fast rate, and IT WILL NOT STOP. The only real reason I was able to login correctly is thanks to the arrow keys and the enter button that is found on my keyboard and I'm sure many many others as well. I couldn't acess the menu option because again, mouse was all over the fkn place. LEt alone select any game modes, and it is listed that it has at least partial controller support. Which leads us to the NEXT FK UP. :D  Second! The game screwed up my controller profiler or SOMETHING, and caused me to have to restart my rig. [Which I did not want to do at the time, but I was FORCED to by this games doing. Thanks.] Here is how!  When I connected my controller to my pc, via wireless gaming adapter from Microsoft. [drivers up-to-date], it popped a notification on screen saying, 'Device Found. Profile Loaded'. My controller did not function on the menu whatsoever, and I wouldve loved to maybe see if it needed to be enabled or configured, but again I COULDN'T because of the mouse issue and no way to navigate the menu ANY OTHER WAY[keyboard/controller]. The controller will flash with a ful green circle as if its trying to connect. It scared me for a moment because before I could fully test my controllers status, I thought that this thing just screwed up my profiler and would cause me to have another task to endure to getting it fixed, [which ended up being a pc restart]. I did find that it was actually connected the whole time, before restarting, I went on to big picture mode, to find the controller was working and navigating through the menus, YET IT STILL FLASHED. Even after disconnecting and offing the controller, when turned back on, it would only flash, but still be connected. So I restarted PC and it fixed. But how did I get out of the game? Well you'd be surprised, because THAT is the THIRD topic of error I want to announce.  THRIDLY. I could not exit the game for the life of me, I had to be a ninja on top notch to figure this ♥♥♥♥ out. And after everything going on previously, my mind was already strung out. I couldn't click on anything obviously, a double esc press can't exit you out, you press escape, you MUST CLICK Yes or No buttons. But I couldn't because it was zipping to top of screen. So I tried windows button. Lol nope. So I tried to start task manager, but every time I'd go to click on it when it appeared and I was 'out of the game', It shot me back to the horror-puzzle free to play that I downloaded apparently. Because it was just that, a puzzle, on how to figure out how to get the ♥♥♥♥ to work, and it horrified me in the process. I've done enough troubleshooting today.  In short, the only thing that was racing in or about this, was my mouse cursor. And myself. It has ♥♥♥♥ed my entire day up, all of this happened and it's not even Noon yet. BRUH.   Race-outofmyfkn-Room Racing Experience. [Mouse Cursor Edition]  And devs, I don't mean to sound overly harsh, but this literally has ♥♥♥♥ed my entire mood for gaming the rest of the week, for ANY genre, just any game in general. And even if I were to get it fixed, the drive for me to play it has completely vaporized, and wouldn't be worth a fraction of a second more out of my life TBH. It probably wasn't worth all this effort anyways. This was overall, ♥♥♥♥♥ saddening.  You've really outdone yourselves, guys. Congrats. Now Devs, go out to Wal-Mart, and buy the whole team a slice o' fkn cake, how about it??   Good day. Lol [ Link to evidence  https://youtu.be/g9KMsLdSwH8  ]
1332	0	a	Absolutley no point to this game unless youre a really big formula 1 racer fanatic. its basically a simulation with 95% of all content is pay to play
1333	0	a	Controls are really baaaaad and you have to buy most of the cars ;) Hence buy a $100 steam card if you want all the cool cars in this game ;)
1334	0	a	this game uses input filtering. this means that your inputs are completely decoupled from what the in-game steering whels do.
1335	0	a	Great physics, great sound, decent graphics...boring game. Slim vehicle lineup with some great tracks (many tracks you can't find on other games). My racing group and I bought in only when the 80-90% sales were on. Simply put the pay-to-play 'free to play' nonsense ruined what should have been a serious contender for Project CARS, AC etc. It has the quality to compete, but the purchase model is stupid.  No AI use in multiplayer games also diminishes the appeal. The tracks are nice but the environment is very sterile (akin to Assetto Corsa). Great controller options and technical options but doesn't deliver much in the way of envirionmental options, etc.   This is the game which should have been great. We all openly agreed we'd have paid a normal $60 pricetag but everyone I race with is turned off by the silly pay-per-car junk. That's the only reason I can't recommend this unless you stumble upon one of their big sales.
1336	0	a	games fails to launch. tried all possible fixes (recommended by developer and users)  the request refund button does not work in steam.   running a win 10 with 16 gb ram, i7 6th gen and 2gb nvidia video card  My recomandation is not to buy this game - stay away
1337	0	a	Fairly boring.
9473	1	a	This do look awright donit!?
9475	1	a	Even though the trailer does make it look somewhat ridiculous and not very soccer based, the fast based gameplay is very gripping and the gameplay becomes addictive in a flash. Once you get over the initial rookie problems, such as the relatively unwieldy controls and pace of game, it pulls you in and forces you to play for hours. Fantastic game.
9477	1	a	Pros:   its fun  The game focuses on your own player to improve its status &amp; become one of the top players in the world it gets addicting to the point that you just want to make another turn or match its simple  the controls feels like those old SNES soccer games that we loved  Cons:  No option to make a match longer  Pointless online feature that directs you to a 3rd party site in order to sync your player's records   For an indie game with this much content its actually good.  I like the idea of improving your own player and options to do outside the match because it gives me this RPG vibe.  If you're not in a hurry to buy this game its okay to slip it until it goes on sale but yeah, this is surprisingly a fun &amp; addicting game to me.
9479	1	a	Get's repetitive after awhile, but very interesting and fun to progress your player and buy new things. It's enjoying to watch your player get better and better contract offers, even if actual matches can be extremely similar.
1355	0	a	I'll give NSS5 that, it's a relatively enjoyable game. The match gameplay is reminiscent of Sensible Soccer and other early 90's, and definitely works in a retro kind of way. The resource managing outside of matches helps build the game into a slightly larger, funner experience. All in all, NSS5 is a charming game that promises a few hours of fun.  The drawback, however, is that the game is kind of a poorly designed, buggy mess. Save files get corrupted left and right, the game freezes with alarming regularity, and the puzzling online requirement tends to make starting new games a chore (hot tip: If you happen to buy it and struggle starting a game because of connectivity issues, edit the Settings\Settings.txt file. Change the line nettimeout=5 to nettimeout=100).  All in all, I can't recommend it. There's not enough here to defend the crippling issues the game has, and definitely not enough to defend their pricing point. Steer clear.
9481	1	a	This is an amazing game! Just like any real life sport... the more you practice, the better you get. This is true in this game, which is where the leveling up really increases the enjoyment factor. Yes, you don't start out a super-star, your not, you are a rookie, but as you play it, and you improve your abilities, you become one. As you become a super-star, not only are you winning your games, but you are living the life. One of my favorite parts of this game, is how it includes off-the-field perks of being an athlete, and lets you live the life. Great great game, for all the good-sport, sports-enthusiasts out there. The game gives you several control options, my favorite, that worked well for me, was the 'game controller'.
1358	0	a	This game had incredible potential due to its extremely detailed and deep simulation mechanics. For example, drinkng too much energy drink before a game will cause your player to have stomach cramps during the match.  Sadly, the only part of the game that is solid is the life-simulation/managment portion of this game. The actual soccer-playing gameplay falls flat because of the extremely clunky controls and poor on-field presentation. Problems include that there is only one speed your player can go at (no sprinting vs walking), aiming is near impossible while running, and heading just dosen't work. Also, the game makes your eyes hurt like hell after an hour, as the players are tiny and so is the ball. Staring at a bright green field that fills the entire screen dosen't help, my eyes felt dead after around an hour of playing. TL;DR: The on-field portion of this game being bad prevents the enjoyment of the surrounding complex life-sim mechanics. Stick to the mobile version, if you don't mind the grind.
9483	1	a	Its a great game in my words. You should get it while its cheaper than its original price. Its a Fun, Awesome, and Great game. -Coolman14066
1359	0	a	This is an okay game with a bunch of flaws, but fairly easy to win once you have the hang of it and can be fun especially if you played games like footballer of the year back in the day, this is very much an update of that where you actually play the game in full (if abbreviated) rather than just shooting at the goal.  You start off as a lowly footballer who can't shoot, pass, run, dribble or anything. Day by day you can practise, buy toys, go out with the girlfriend (if you have one), try to build up a rapport with your team mates, fans, or boss, etc. Initially the main thing is to build the skills and you do training drills where you have to bend the ball, beat defenders, tackle, dribble around cones, etc. in a limited amount of time/attempts, if you do your skills when you play games improve in the appropriate area.  In terms of playing matches you start off as a sub only having a few minutes, and maybe not being picked at all. Based on doing well in various in game stats you try to get good game ratings, which will get you picked more often, or even a starting position in the team if you keep doing well. At this point you start to having to manage your energy by buying toys to keep you occupied during matches, NRG drinks (which often give you cramps during a game), etc. You also need to spend energy managing relationships if you want your teammates to pass to you, your girlfriend not to dump you, your friends not to hate you, etc. So you get into a balancing act of all these things, and you have to learn how to play the minigame puzzles (pair matching for relationships, 'simon says' for the media), etc.  The main in game challenge isn't really about winning matches, once you know the AIs weaknesses this is fairly easy (for example the quick turn to lure defenders into sliding tackles to clear the way, the banana dribble close to the goalie to lure him out and then walk the ball into the net, the direct vertical run outside the goal to curl into the same side top corner, the diagonal curling out/in balls, etc.). The problem instead is trying to use the match to improve your ranking and stats - so doing lots of safe passing in your own half to build up teammate approval without spending energy, getting some tackles in without getting cards, and otherwise building up your stats for passing/tackles/set pieces to increase your transfer value and wages higher, etc., as the benefit from just scoring more and more goals and winning games is capped - you have to become more rounded to be the best.  Overall the game is quite good fun at times, although it can be frustrating as well, and your team mates need a lot of managing/adaptation to actually be useful to you given how braindead they are, and the out of match stuff makes for a reasonably interesting balancing act. Once you are successful it does all become fairly formulaic however, as once you are fully skilled up and have largely capped out your relationships it is relatively easy to deal with any new off the field problems, and winning matches/championshops/cups is a breeze once you have the skills and know the AIs strengths and weaknesses. I am not sure I would recommend it to most people however at full price, as I doubt most will play it for long enough to really justify the price tag, and apparently it hasn't been on sale for over a year at this point, but this could be a fun game if you like the idea (and have a controller!) and can put up with some bugs/flaws.
9485	1	a	Awesome game, very good and challenging at times, would reccomend it to anyone who is a mad of football!!!
9487	1	a	Funny small game about your career as a football player, play for a club and improve your skills to play at a bigger stage, and get your chance to play for your national team.
9489	1	a	This game isn't very well looked afterby developers. I think they care more about the IOS version. probably because thats the version with micro-T's and such. There can be some annoying bugs but they arenbt game breaking. Once you get down to gameplay its actually good fun and it makes for a nice little pick up and play football experience. I find though that playing for a long time can become boring and very repetetive. Graphics are 2D but its style is good very similar to old skool Title Sensible Soccer. Overall i would reccomend to those that dont want a serious football sim and are just after that classic arcade feel sports gem.
1361	0	a	'Cannot connect to NSS5 Network'. I am connected to the internet. I am running Steam in Online Mode. If I can't connect the NSS5 Network, you can't create a new game. I am unable to play this. If a game is LITERALLY unplaable, it has dramatically failed Game Design 101.  *slow sarcastic clap*
9491	1	a	A nice rpg/soccer game for people who grew up with soccer games of 80s and early 90s  Pros: + Gameplay (Matches): Similar to Sensible Soccer serie of Amiga era. Sensible Soccer gameplay was great compared to Kick Off 2 since KO2 was too fast for my taste. (Hint: Teenagers and Fifa era players stay away, you wont get the fun of it.) + Gameplay (Rpg/Sim): Transferring yourself, training stuff, buying things and managing personal life adds a great flavour to the game. + Art: Actual matches looks too similar to Sensible World of Soccer with great animation, crowd and weather effect add-on.  Cons: - Sound: Music is bad. Sfx does its part on matches but could have been far better. - DRM system: Signing on to a server (which fails to connect most of the time) is not a good idea (PS: You dont have to be signed in to play). - Needs more improvement and rpg flavour (maybe NSS6?)  Final verdict: I've spent many fun hours with the game. It was nice remembering my teenage years which wasted on soccer games :) NSS needs its next installment. So far 7/10
9493	1	a	Not a beauty, but the combination of some manager genre elements with basic football gameplay is addicting. Also well paced achievement system.
9495	1	a	This game is taking up too much of my life...I think to myself i'll have 15 minutes or so and that turns in a hour easily...simple yet effective ideas which make a perfect time killer of a game
9497	1	a	Fun little soccer game, I'm playing it to create a basis for a future character in Football Manager, however there are a few gripes.  probably the most glaring problem is that your teammate AI can be unreliable; like they'll run straight at the other team's player and get tackled, rather than try dodging or passing the ball.  Your coach can be bi-polar sometimes with his game and post-game comments.  ball hit-box is a little funny sometimes, where you won't 'catch' the ball when you thought you would.  The refs though are pretty accurate, even though the game doesn't explain what constitutes a yellow flag (I had to actually look up what they give them for and make a guess)  Don't expect matches to be upwards of 90 minutes either, maximum is only ~15 minutes for a regular match.  If you can get past all that though, you're in for a cute little time-waster.
9499	1	a	Not as good as the app. rip in pepperoni
1364	0	a	Thought this was type of game like Sensible Soccer but I was wrong. This game is more like the old Striker game from the ZX Spectrum. You will pass many minutes in the game menus and you will need an online connection. Not the game I was expecting...
9501	1	a	NSS5 is a football life 'simulator' where you create a player and play football in any one of a ridiculous number of nations and your national team too.  The teams are based on real teams, so anyone with basic footballing knowledge should be able to tell that Stamford FC are Chelsea and that Gunners are Arsenal. Your starting team determines your starting skill and wage, your skill can be improved by doing training sessions that range from boring to infuriatingly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥zzle. When not training or playing you are either improving relationships with people you don't give a ♥♥♥♥ about so that you don't become depressed, drinking when you do become depressed, or failing to get girlfriends because they dont like your lifestyle. This part of the game hits close to home and makes me cry.  When you do get big money you can use it to buy stuff to impress women and buy PEDs which make you a better player, you can also abuse sponsorship deals for stat increasing boots and other gear. When you level up and start scoring for fun you can then demand funny money to spend on more pointless stuff that no-one would ever buy. Oh a gold chain for £2000? I forgot it was 1988 and I was Slick Rick.  The game has some always online feature that allows you to play with other players' avatars in matches which despite the fact that I play for a 4th division Scottish team always seems to be 6'8' black guys named Devarious Le'shintrella. The servers are also complete ♥♥♥ and break all the time meaning that you just play against AI characters instead.  Game is fairly fun but the fact that I always wanted to be a footballer and have a girlfriend mean that playing this game makes me self-harm and drink a lot of alcohol in real life whilst I force my player to be an alcoholic too because I never got to be a footballer and don't have a girlfriend.  Don't play if you're depressed.  P.s. if you're reading this and a girl pls add me on steam I promise to send gifts &lt;3
9503	1	a	one of the best football games ever
9505	1	a	This has been one of my favorite games for a long tim e now. I played this game on mobile and had the most fun i ever could have had on a mobile game. But this...this steps it up an entirely different level. There is no doubt this is one of the best soccer games on the market. if it hadn't have been for this game, i never would ahve gotten involved with soccer so much. 10/10-Would Reccomend
9507	1	a	Throw away FIFA and PES . . this is best football game that ever existed. I hate football . . and still I have been playing this for weeks :D. Very addictive :)
1368	0	a	Upon first impressions of the screenshots, it's fair to assume that New Star Soccer 5 would be a modern, hopefully deeper attempt at the 90s Sensible Soccer games. Besides the appearance of the match engine, I feel that this game should not be compared to any Sensible Soccer game. New Star Soccer 5 simply does not deliver the same quality of gameplay and overall polish as the 90s favorites.  In this game, there is much focus placed on the life of the athlete you play as. You will be able to choose which skills to train in, you will be able to take part in social activities with friends, teammates, and a girlfriend. You will have the chance to build your relationship with your manager and the fans, and you will also be allowed to spend money on many items and properties. Most of the time, the way you must perform these actions is by playing memory games where cards will be flashed with different images on them, then they will then be flipped over and and scrambled, and you will need to match two of a kind. That's all there is to it, and it isn't any fun.  The developer chose to implement a DRM-like system of player creation and in-game updates where you must manually create an account with a password on their servers, and every single time the game updates after a match, for example, it tries to connect again to their servers. The problem is that the connection to their servers fails almost every single time the game tries to reach them to save your progress. This means that you will need to retry the connection over and over, until it works, each time the game fails to connect to their servers, and it happens extremely often.  The career mode allows for the player to go through a maximum of 20 in-game years, and after that you will need to retire that player and begin a new career with someone new. With your player, you will go through his early development as a teenager all the way to a veteran in his late 30s. There is a simple contract negotiation between you and the clubs, there are transfers, there are relegations and promotions within the leagues, and there are international competitions for both club and country. There are some major flaws with all of these features. Very little of what goes on both in the player's career and on the pitch actually makes any sense. Match ratings are almost totally broken, with the game giving your player a low rating or a high rating apparently not reflecting anything that occurred on the pitch. Your 17 year old player will become club captain and be called up to the national team for doing nearly nothing. It's as if these events were scripted into the programming of the game no matter what you did as a player or how well you played the matches. How well your club performs in cups and championships seems to be artificially altered by more scripted programming, having nothing to do with how well you play or even if you play in the matches at all. Choosing to skip a match and not playing in it makes no difference at all in what happens in the game world or how well your club performs. If the programming of the game wants your club to win or wants you to have whatever random rating, that's exactly what will happen.  The way the match engine looks is what drew my attention to this game, and coming from playing the Sensible Soccer games in the 90s, I was hopeful to relive a modern take on those games. I was very disappointed. The match engine has many problems, including those related to your teammates' and opponents' AI. Everything seems scripted and the other players on the pitch will not do more than precisely what they were programmed to do. Asking them to pass you the ball can produce some senseless and ridiculous moments. Every match played is almost identical to the last, and can be won by using the same exact strategy as before. The controls are imprecise and can be frustrating at times. The shooting and passing mechanics perform inadequately and rarely the way you intend. It's also really obvious that the game is intended to be experienced by people playing primarily as strikers, and secondarily as attacking midfielders. Every other position won't make any sense at all. If you want to be part of the action on the pitch, you will need to travel the entire field and play out of position almost always. Even as a striker and as an attacking midfielder, if you actually want to be part of the match, you will need to run all over the place and play out of position a lot of the time. In addition to New Star Soccer 5 having all these problems and looking and feeling like a mobile game, it's just not any fun. There are rarely any moments where your actions will mean actual accomplishments, as the game is playing itself down to all the events it has been scripted to do.  New Star Soccer 5 is mediocre.

9511	1	a	I bought this game (and played it for a considerable amount of time) before it was available on Steam. Needless to say, I was addicted to it. Its simple gameplay make it very appealing as a casual game, but one you'll be playing for hours!
9513	1	a	Great fun and very addictive football game for all footie fans out there!
9515	1	a	This game is fun but I still miss NSS 3.
9517	1	a	I have loads of fun playing this game and while it has some huge flaws the main core of the game is good. The bad consists in silly puzzles, loosing 'fame' even if you had 5 assists in a match and you can only get a girlfriend if you have a certain amount of money. Training also seems a bit off in terms of difficulty, some too easy and others too hard. Prices on players are also non comprehensible.  However I did buy this game to play the core of the game and see my youngster rise to the stars, that I have done. He is now at Swansea, has won the world cup for Denmark and is world wide known, everyone wants him but his pricetag is lower than the average premier league footballer, much lower. That did not stop me from buying a joypad and enjoying playing a lot, you control a single player on the pitch and after a few trials I got the hang of it, its fun to score and assist while the coach never seems happy insulting you on every turn.  In the rise of ranks I started at the Conference North with Histon... then proceeded to Dag&amp;Red, Exeter and then Swansea. I am mainly enjoying playing the matchesand looking at the statistics, something which also has kept me playing. I can look at my history and check a lot of stuff which I have done in the past.  The rest of the game is mediocre at best, some of the stuff seems made for 6 year old kids hence many bad reviews. The price should be a bit lower, around the 5 euro mark, as it is now its a bit too expensive but I would still recommend just for the core play. You can always wait till it comes on sale however.  
1375	0	a	Dont bother, this would be good on a mobile or tablet though.
9519	1	a	i don't understand why NSS3 players didn't like this one. we have nearly same game here.
1381	0	a	A rather basic soccer gameplay (with great chanting/singing during the games), smothered in a plethora of rpg like busy work menus. Not my cup of tea.
9521	1	a	Not much to say about this game, it is perfect for the football fan who want to work on his/hers Reaction Times :P if u can get it on sale dont hessatate to buy :P
1382	0	a	If you are planing on buying this game I suggest that you not. It is a very terrable game and it sucks.
9523	1	a	I've Only Played a Small portion of this game.  I think this game is quite well done, The controls are a bit Meh.  Once I changed the Controls I felt quite Comfortable, Playing in the worst league.  Overall, It is worth it, It can get Repetitive at times, but Just play another game for a while and then come back to it, Thats what I'm doing.
9525	1	a	In first 5 mins of first half got tackled when he missed the tackle got injured then 0.5 secs later he runs as if he has 10 star pace AND HES EVEN INJURED of the field and then gets bad rating cuz got injured and apperently the firest 10 secs of a match is a good way to evaluate how you played and nearly scored 10/10 -IGN     WHEN WILL THEY FRIED FREEKIN CHICKEN UPDATE THIS GAME 2 YEARS 2 YEARS.FTW
1386	0	a	Dont buy it. It's a scam, doesn't work etc.
9527	1	a	hey is there anybody who can tell me where i can get new sat soccer 2 ? please help someone my good friend google is of no use :)
1388	0	a	There was a version of this game for free on the internet that was a lot more interactive when it comes to league games. This version is more like an old SEGA game.
1389	0	a	Love the game on mobile, they've tried to develop it on PC but they've just overcomplicated it and tried to add too much freedom. The reason people love the handheld version is because it is really simple. Now the game allows you to run around throughout the entire game, which in theory sounds good but it's really poor.  You call for a pass whilst running and your teammates pass behind you then you get the blame for calling for the pass poorly when in reality you're teammate is to blame for the hideous pass. Trying to head the ball is abysmal too. Once you get the ball, you can go on a lot of dribbles and play some nice passes in to your teammates but it's very difficult to tackle opponents and because your teammates can barely pass to you, you find yourself having played 1 pass throughout a game of 90 minutes.  It's cheap so if you enjoy the handheld version, you'll have a voice in your head urging you to buy this. However don't say I didn't warn you!  Oh yes, also the game keeps crashing. I've googled the error to no avail. An exception occurs so perhaps the developers need to try and look into what causes the exception to be thrown.
9529	1	a	Live the life of an up-and-coming superstar in this unique football career game. Start out as a 16 year old lad and work your way to the top to become a footballing legend! You need to train hard, play matches, make transfers, do interviews, stay in touch with friends, sign sponsorship deals, go to the casino, buy cars, and more! With so many distractions in a footballer's life is it any wonder that so many don't make it? But what about you? Can you become a new star?
9531	1	a	I got this game in a bundle and didn't have any expectations whatsoever. I decided to install it for the hell of it because it was only a few megabytes. Well here I am six hours later, completely blown away with how entertaining this game turned out to be.  Pros:  - So much more than just a soccer game (includes casino games, horse racing, mini games, etc.) - Basic graphics than can run smoothly on any computer (think NES/SNES) - Simple controls  Cons: - Some of the achievements don't register on Steam (not a big deal for me, but to some people it might be) - Sometimes it can be a little difficult to control your player since the controls really are simple  All in all I would highly recommend this game. 9/10
9533	1	a	Brilliant game, much better than the equivalent modes on FIFA and Pro Evo
9535	1	a	seems throwaway and the lack of steam achievement support is annoying but the real feel of progression is brilliant. Worth investing time in an old school Sim
9537	1	a	awsome to live a players life
1395	0	a	If the game worked properly it'd be fun as hell. But no matter what loading up the game causes my computer to crash. In the 90s and early 2000s I could see a game causing a BSOD issue, but in this day and age it's unthinkable. There is NO support from the designer. Support tickets on their forums range back years without replies or fixes.
9539	1	a	This is fun. Pick up and play anytime you like!
1398	0	a	Fun game when working, but really messy and is often not able to connect to the server, meaning you can't play it. Plus my player was lost on the server so i had to restart after 7 hours of playing. Not worth it.
9541	1	a	Firstly it's not remotely worth the price tag, but on a big sale it might be worth it. It can be a fun little time waster. If you ever played Kick Off or Sensible Soccer when you were younger then you'll love this. It's a game where you play as a player, not as the team, or manager. You have to train yourself to make yourself better, then try to win the approval of your boss, your teammates, your friends, and potentially a cutie girlfriend. :)
1399	0	a	I love this game!  But i think its time to give this game a huge update like -more competitions -new kits -updated competition data   And a lot more. I hope the developer will give this game a huge update soon. But i am afraid that won't happen anymore. 
1400	0	a	compared with NSS 2010 this game is very hard for me to control the player using the keyboard. Beside the game will automatically skip into next game, and the stats are more fewer, no stats like acceleration, control, etc. Better get NSS 2010 though
9543	1	a	A great arcade football game where you play as only one player at the huge field. You'll be responsible to train your player and make him rich!  I can't recommend it enough to football fans.
9545	1	a	It's rare to find a decent Cricket game since the mid-90s to mid-2000s. During this time it was a battle of two publishers: Electronic Arts and Codemasters. Early iterations of the game were fun and lacked the realism that most sports games demand. If you're considering DBC 14 I also recommend searching for EA's Cricket 96 (PC) or Codemaster's Shane Warne Cricket 99 (PS1) on eBay.   But back to more current matters. DBC 14 is by far the most authentic cricket game since the EA Sports release of Cricket 2005 for the PC and PS2. Running the game for the first time, you are met with an update that thankfully changes all player names to real names. I hope to see an update in the future that contains real stadium names too. Once in the game, you have various game options from 5-over a side to full blown test cricket. You can also create yourself and move up the ranks of world cricket.  The practice arena is great too, reminiscent of a training nets session. From time to time I find myself relaxing in the nets just having a hit. I've only accumulated a few hours on the PC version but I did so, migrating from the XBOX 360 version. DBC 14 has a solid frame rate and feels very smooth. One aspect that still needs improving is the commentary. While not bad, it's not great. It's certainly not as annoying as other sports games (like PES) but not as smooth or free flowing.   I love the camera angles in this game. When playing solo, you are shown your player from the 3rd person perspective. While this is standard fare for bowling in all cricket games, it's quite refreshing for batting and makes the game feel more authentic. Fielding is decent too and the camera angles during play are superb.  At the time of writing this, I'm in search for games during the Steam sale. However I was quite willing to drop the full price for this game for two reasons: Supporting not just a local developer, but one that is willing to put the time and effort to capture a sport that itself has captured millions around the world.
9547	1	a	Well and truly the best cricket game ever made.  It still has problems, of course, but there has never been such an in depth cricket game. Don Bradman Cricket 14 is very challenging no matter the difficultly, and when you win you feel a real sense of achievement. Avid cricket fans will love this, as there is so much to it. It's as much a cricket simulation as there might ever be.  Well done, Big Ant Studios.
9549	1	a	As someone who doesn't come from a background steeped in cricket knowledge or history (I'm American), I wasn't really sure what to expect, but cricket holds a certain novelty for me, and I wanted to give this game a try. Not only am I glad I did, but it has become one of my favorite sports games of all-time.  Tl;dr - If you're a fan of the sport, this is simply a must-have. If you have a passing interest, this game could actually help your understanding of the sport and also happens to be extremely fun and satisfying.  On the surface, just like baseball, cricket is a simple game: throw the ball, hit the ball, catch the ball, curse under your breath when you're out. Just like baseball, though, there is an immense amount of strategic subtlety, and unlike America's pastime, cricket has a much wider range of strategic nuance, offering endless combinations of fielders and bowling styles. DBC14 captures the essence of that strategy by putting players in complete control of their fielding alignments and customizing them for bowlers, batsmen, or both.  Which brings me to the crux of cricket and of DBC14 - what goes on at that little brown strip in the middle of the field. Bowlers are offered a wide array of options, especially pace bowlers. Toy with line and length, swing the ball to and fro, whatever you want to do to go for wickets. All this complexity is broken down into a relatively straightforward control scheme that is easy to learn but difficult to master. Pace bowling is definitely harder to get the timing on than spin bowling, but it's the pace men who offer the most excitement and get the most wickets.  Batting is also somewhat straightforward. Batsmen have the ability to survey the field and get ideas on how to attack it, can choose to go for a shot in the air or along the ground or play a sweep. It's all mapped out quite cleanly, but the big key I found was timing; especially with pace bowlers, getting a good feel for the rhythm of the deliverly lets batsmen time the ball up and crush it. If the player is in rhythm, it's not difficult to churn out 20-30 runs an over, especially in T20 when bowlers are more aggressive. By that same token, mistime a big swing for the ropes, and you're down a wicket. Bowling AI is smart and will adjust even within overs to cover areas where you're consistently putting the ball, forcing you to stay on your toes and play an all-round innings at the crease.  I will say that running and fielding felt a bit clunky. It was tough to know if I had hit the ball right to a man in the field because of the way the camera swings around, and (at least early on) I had a few run-outs because I got a little trigger-happy, but I also missed out on runs because I couldn't see where the ball was. It'd be helpful, too, when fielding, to have a diagram of where each button throws the ball. I still don't have it down and will find my fielder throwing at the bowler's stumps when the keeper has the other batsman dead to rights. Ultimately, though, I can forgive those things because the most important aspects of the on-field experience are just so strong.  The game has a variety of ways to play the sport, with all the Test nations, the three major domestic leagues (England, Australia, and India), and a bevy of formats covered, and if you don't like what's on offer, players can create their own content through the Don Bradman Academy, a robust customization engine where everything can be tweaked. (And, since this game contains little or no licensed content, players can create their own approximations of modern cricketers and teams). Players can also create their own leagues, tournaments, tour schedules, and even formats of the game through the DBA. It's a wonderful little tool that adds tremendous depth to what could have otherwise been a rather pedestrian between-match experience, and it might be my favorite feature of the entire game.  I guess my biggest complaints are the lack of licensed content (addressed by the Don Bradman Academy system, but it's not quite the same), and the menu music. They only included a handful of tracks that get quite tiresome after a while, and I haven't found any way to add custom music to the game. That would be a wonderful feature that would keep me playing this game forever. Heck, I'm probably playing this game forever anyway. Run, don't walk, to buy Don Bradman Cricket 14.
9551	1	a	Arguably the best Cricket game ever, and I've played many. If not, it's certainly near the top.  Nice graphics, excellent gameplay, patches released on a regular basis. There is realism, depth (batting especially will take a little while to get the hang of), and room for the community to step in and create players, teams and umpires. And there is a long-awaited CAREER MODE, where you start as a 16 year old and work your way up from County/State/Province-level to International selection.  There isn't a large amount of stadia, but this is to be expected of a first release. Clearly gameplay has been the focus and DBC14 is better for it.  In my opinion, DBC14 is worthy of the 'Don Bradman' branding. Well done Big Ant on hitting this one for six.  P.S. You will need a controller, which I think is a good move, I couldn't imagine playing this on a keyboard.
9553	1	a	In short: this is the best cricket game I've ever played.   The controls felt really strange initally, but just playing the demo and batting in the nets was a strangely satisfying experience. I enjoy all the disciplines and being able to be succesful actually requires skill. I can't claim to be very good at anything in this game, but it feels very similar to my real-life cricketing abilities, so there's that.  I've spend the majority of my time playing the career mode in this game. It feels pretty realistic, except that with some of my performances, i'm sure my county should have left me out of some games.   Is the game perfect? No. The commentary is pretty inaccurate and repetitive. There's a lot of missed catches for seemingly no reason. And although I enjoy bowling, sometimes it's really hit-and-miss about how to dismiss a batsmen. But as that's similar to the real thing, I guess that can't be a complaint.  If you enjoy cricket games, buy it. There's nothing I've played that's come close.
9555	1	a	simply fantastic, Big Ant did a brilliant job with this game! and I remember watching a friend of mine, Twistie3, playing this on a livestream, with Ross, the CEO or something like that of Big Ant, and it just blew me away, it was like something I had never seen before! So, of course I bought it the day it came out on PS3 then several months later on the PC. The mods are astounding for this game, the things some people can do, yes the gameplay can get a tad boring at times, but it's all the variety that makes it so great, so many modes to choose from. the graphics are quite fancy aswell, and quite realistic. Overall, my favourite game in my steam library (maybe 2nd to bad rats) I would reccomend DBC 14 to anyone who is a fan of cricket, and my crappy old computer can run it, so you can too! FINAL SCORE - 9.5 / 10 (only 9.5 because of all the times i have been bowled for a duck)
9557	1	a	Best cricket game out in the market
9559	1	a	Best cricket game ever made.
9561	1	a	since i culdnt play online mode yet - so far im satisfed with the pc version game look better on pc obviously! 1080p + AA ;) ive been playing offline steam dsnt seems to record those hours anyhow this game is a gem ! ppl who waited so long for a cricket game this is it! Don bradman Cricket 14 is the way to go.. hopefully there will be Don Bradman Cricket 15 end of next year -D
9563	1	a	Amazing game , the only dislike i have is the fielding when catching can be buggy ,for example the change of direction some players seam to glitch (idk how to describe it someone back me up lol) and it just looks so unnatural and awkward , also the game difficulty is very realistic , as an avid crickiter and supporter (Durham and England) i feel this game does cricket justice i struggle to win on pro never mind expert so hats off to those who do , batting is fluid , bowling the same , probably one of the best sports games i've played , the devs should feel very very proud of this game its an absolute masterpiece , one thing i would like for the next game is more name licenses that would really complete it and obviously with no other cricket games been made this shouldn't be to hard other than the cost which is a stumbling block ,however thanks some people you can download all the real name squads anyway . GREAT GAME
9565	1	a	The best cricket game out there. I know that sounds like it's not hard seeing as there are so few out there but it really is well done. Easy controls to get to grips with, there is perfect balance between it not being too hard too easy to peform bowling, batting or fielding. So many other games made catches or bowling nearly impossible due to there being such a fine line between perfection or oblivion. Also this game does not give you wickets left, right and centre. You might Five-fors, you might get hat-tricks. But they will be as often as the professionals get, you will get that stubborn batsman whom you try everything to get out and then boom a simple shot sends the bails flying and your arm raising in triumph.   One thing I hope for in the future is perhaps the addition of more stadiums, better commentary (it does get a little repetitive) and better designed character models (Jimmy Anderson looks like a caveman).
9567	1	a	The precision bowling and batting is incredible, along with very very satisfying fielding play. I most definitely rate Don Bradman Cricket 14 a 10/10
9569	1	a	Also an American who does not have a Cricket knowledge background, this is a fantastic creation of the game.
9571	1	a	Wow, finally a cricket game worth playing!!!  A couple of days in and I've created a couple of players and am enjoying taking them through their first season.   In my first match I spent 30 overs fielding at deep backward square leg and took a screamer of a catch before I worked out there is a menu option to simulate to your players next involvement either with the bat or the ball.  The leg spinning all-rounder is challenging having bowled a few overs to reset myself and concentrate on batting as the next task although the bowling mechanics are fun and challenging at the same time. The specialist batsman is great to play a few shots with, but I am struggling to keep my concentration, particularly if I've managed to get onto a couple of early boundaries (the same issue I had in real life)!  My highlights after approx 15 hours? Taking a 5 wicket haul for SA against Tassie and the 50 I scored for Derbyshire with my young opener off 13 balls!  The only gripes I have with the game are the commentary being inserted at random as about 1/2 the time it doesnt make sense (so I've taken to playing music at the same time) and the grounds...I've had an English County game and SA v Tas at the MCG! These are small issues though when compared to the important part of a cricket game...do the mechanics feel engaging, fluid and as though you are controlling your player...in short, yes!  This game is fun to play and being a cricket game has enough stats to keep a cricket fan entertained. Do I like my batting average being just under 30? No; will I keep playing to improve it? Yes!  That is what this genre has been missing since Shane Warne/Brian Lara's cricket in the late 90s...a game worth playing!
9573	1	a	First good cricket game ever with realistic controls and much excitement..Big Ant really desereve a grand salute for making this awesome game in the midst of poor cricket game industry.their hard work paid off.Everything about this game is too good.Graphics look a bit backdated,but hey who cares,when you have got this realistic gameplay?forget the days when you scored 200 in 10 overs.Its the time to bite the dust.this game will really need your every bit of skill to master.I would give 8.5/10 to this game.could have been 9.5,if there werent any glitches(minor) and a better graphic.But overall I must say,If u are a cricket game fan U gotta buy this.U wont regret it.
9575	1	a	Also an American who does not have a Cricket knowledge background, this is a fantastic creation of the game.
9577	1	a	The Best Cricket Game EVER!!! For any one who played EA Cricket 07 you know this is an outstanding cricket. May this franchise last for ever.
9579	1	a	I don`t usually write reviews, but this deserves an exception!! The cost of the game is a bit high but if you enjoy cricket you will love this. It takes some getting used to at first as the controls really are unlike any other cricket game - after a whie it is really rewarding tho. I spent ages just on the character creation screen. With the imported names option and the cool support from Big Ant Studios i think it will be years till this game is bettered. Oh.....and I`ve no game crashing bugs so far.
9581	1	a	We finally have a cricket game that surpases shane warne cricket 99 and Cricket 07 from EA. So much detail into the smaller things that matter and a fresh new way to play.   9.8 out 10 Its a master of cricket games, deserves hall of fame . Im glad to see you can play old teams and not just current ones it even brings a career mode where you star as young rising star. This game deserves every penny it asks for, i say this because if the people behind this game continue down this path there are some very exciting times down the line.
9583	1	a	The Best Cricket Game EVER!!! For any one who played EA Cricket 07 you know this is an outstanding cricket. May this franchise last for ever.
9585	1	a	Hands Down ! Best Cricket Game Ever !
9587	1	a	It really is the best cricket game ever. I am loving almost everything about this game right now. AI seems good, they put fielders where they sense is my weakness and try to remove my strong shots. Graphics are pretty good too and the game runs smoothly. But the best thing about this game is the new controls Big Ant have introduced. They make batting and bowling really fun and challenging.
9589	1	a	Definately the best cricket game ever (not counting the International Cricket Captain management games, but this probably beats them too). Great career mode where you create player and take control exclusively of him, rather than the whole team. Really nice player and team editor too, and the community creations means it's not a big deal that the game lacks licenses. You can just download pretty good representations from any team you can think of from the cricket academy.
9591	1	a	The Best Cricket Game ever.
9593	1	a	i like this game. its good to see a cricket game after long time.
9595	1	a	Best cricket game. Amazing graphics and game engine. The scoreboard could be different for each stadium and the commentary could have been better. May be in the next version they will add manager version to the game.
9597	1	a	It is undoubtedly the best cricket game ever developed. Feels amazing when you smash the ball for the six or you play a wonderful cover drive and you really feel like celebrating when you take a wicket. The BARS introduced in this game is again the USP of this game along with other in depth details kepth in mind my the developers.  Thanks a lot BIG ANTS STUDIOS for such a Great Cricket Game which the Cricket Crazy fans wanted since long.
9599	1	a	The best ever cricket game made ever. Easy to play tough to master. Great deal of satisfaction seeing that bowling with a plan rewards you with a wicket, or the batsman sees your plan and smacks you for a 6. Great realism , great controls all round great Game!
9601	1	a	Advanced graphics and good gameplay. Bummer regarding the unavailablity of players for Online Playing.
9603	1	a	Superb Cricket game ever!
9605	1	a	great game yay
9607	1	a	Easily the best cricket game ever made.  The learning curve can be steep but the rewards are there if you put in the time and effort.  It can be a bit fiddly to start with as the controls are nothing like any cricket game ever made, so persevere and you'll be rewarded.  For every wicket you take there is a sense of pride, just like when you score some runs.  For me I've found the batting to be the hardest part, whereas bowling is tough but like I said rewarding.  This game is well worth your time and effort.
9609	1	a	I know very little about cricket. All that I know is what I learned by watching it during my trips to India (where you can always find it on TV). I still suck at this game, but have gotten a little better as I have played.  With that said, this is a fun game. It seems to play like a real game.
9611	1	a	The best cricket game i have played! A must have for all cricket fans!
9613	1	a	By far the best cricket game to date.
9615	1	a	Out in my first game for a golden duck. 10/10 would buy again
9617	1	a	This is by far the best cricket game ever, after Ashes'09 i never thought we would ever get a good cricket game. This game has got a huge community which is still active, you can download squads you can upload your own team, this game is simply perfect. The only con being there is no World Cup/Series in the Career mode, yes there are different T20 cups, but still a WORLD CUP IS A WORLD CUP &gt;_&lt; . Edit - The multiplayer feature is no good now, would take ages to find someone to play with. Won't recommend it on full price.
9619	1	a	Fanstasic Cricket game, Bowling and Batting mechanics are spot on. Fielding feels strange as the AI takes the most strange a disjointed catches ever seen in a cricket game. Hopefully we see a few patches to iron a few bugs and add in a feature where the players can do replays with hot spot that would be awesome!... Worth the cash in my opinon. Good Job!!.. Come on summer so we can see the Aussie tear someone apart!!!!
9621	1	a	This is definitely the best cricket game in a very, very long time. The community is friendly and are exceedingly active with providing new bats, full updated teams, kit, team badges, etc. Extremely immersive with a very well put together career mode that will keep you busy for hours while you play through the 20 year (from age 16 to 36) career, you can of course start later in the career if you want a shorter one.  Online play is fun and challenging with tourneys being run by some people. The batting will take a lot of getting used to, but with the practice nets, practice match functions and a bunch of patience you can quickly get into it and start scoring runs.  Xbox controllers are definitely recommended as some others that I've tried do not give you the full range of control with the right thumb stick and cuts down what you can and can't do in the game.  Overall I love this game and play it as much as I can, and I definitely recommend it to any friend/family member/acquantance that's looking for a solid cricket game.  8/10 (only because there's a couple issues, but the devs are active on the forums at Planet Cricket and are working on it)
9623	1	a	Awesome Game. Best Cricket Game Ever Developed. We all should buy this game and support the Developers.
9625	1	a	Hands down the best cricket game made to date, and with a developing team that takes community input to heart.
9627	1	a	Great Cricket game after a long time 9/10 :)
9629	1	a	Best cricket game out. PRO: Custom teams Sharing of teams/players Career mode Lots of shot selections Lots of bowling options Fun community First game to do pitch degrading well. Bowling is now fun.  CON: you MUST have a controller. cannot play without. LBW is not automated - you have to know the rules.  Mainly, its really fun. if you want a quick 10over game or if you want to play a 5 day test. its all up to you.
9631	1	a	Top Game
9633	1	a	Great game! Awesome cricket game to be played Multiplayer great and career mode with single player mode is also great. Feels like real  A must have for all cricket fans
9635	1	a	This is the best cricket game ever made.
9637	1	a	This is the best cricket game ever developed.  When i first played it, the experience just swept me off my feet. I was thinking if its really possible to develop a game with so much realism.  Batting seems as if we're really doing it. In order to score runs, you've got to apply yourself. Also one could play all the possible shots in the cricketing notebook.  Edges are very realistic which was never done before in any game.  Fast bowling is a real charm with all the subtle variations possible. Although spin bowling bores me personally, its also good with all real variations.  Overall, Its an excellent game which must not be missed.

9641	1	a	Most addictive game for the cricket fans. Definitely recommended.
9643	1	a	great game so far....i play all type of cricket game...this one is real one....and multiplayer feature make its great more
9645	1	a	This is The Cricket Game, it is the best around surely it has a lot to improve thts what sequels are for but this game is a masterpiece. Made by cricket fans with love for cricket for crickrt fans and others too
9647	1	a	The Best Cricket Game Ever Period
9649	1	a	great game
9651	1	a	best cricket game to date, u like cricket buy it! 9/10
9653	1	a	love the game 7 out of ten   why 7 cause the updates have stopped needs more updates it is the best cricket game but could do with some improvment
9655	1	a	A fantastic cricket simulation, easily the best of a the decade. Wonderful support by the developers post-launch. Would recommend (buy it directly from Big Ant the developers website for a big discount) to anyone who has interest in cricket. Can't wait for the next iteration.
9657	1	a	Best cricket game till date, period.
9659	1	a	One of the most complete cricket games of all time. I have played all the cricket games which have been released before, but this game has all the qualities that a cricket game should have, the graphics are beautiful, the gameplay is smooth, the umpire decisions are accurate and the new DRS feature in the game which is known as BARS is the most innovative thing added in a cricket game, this feature was never added before in any other cricket game and was also meant to be impossible to add it, but hats off to the developers Big Ant Studios, they have done a wonderful job, the only cons for this game is that you get occassional lag spikes and stutters and it is also hard to find internet games, other than that it is a beautiful game and if you're a fan of cricket and wanna buy a cricket game, I would definitely recommend this game hands down.
9661	1	a	Best ever cricket game :)
9663	1	a	Really good graphics but very hard to but when you are a newbie like me at batting   get a NIVIDIA Geforce graphics card and a xbox 360 controller and a tutorial and you are all set  8/10 wouldn't buy through Steam but through EB Games (gamespot)
9665	1	a	One of the best cricket games ever made!
9667	1	a	Only played one match. Boycott was batting.
9669	1	a	This game is a must Buy everything about it just knocks any other cricket game out of the ball park.
9671	1	a	A cricket game afer almost 5 years - and what a materpiece it has turned out to be. All the pros and cons have been adequetely listed by others so I'm not gonna repeat the same things again.  BA Studious have got 90% of the aspects right in their first iteration itself and that speaks volumes of the effort the team has put in. I have no doubt in my mind that in the coming years, if the franchise manages to do well it will easily overtake/threaten the big brands in the market. I can only wish that the PC platform will be supported when that happens.
9673	1	a	If you're going to tie the great Sir Donald Bradman to your game, you better not mess it up. Thankfully, Big Ant studios have done anything but and have possibly made the best cricket game ever. The detail that has gone into this game is quite remarkable. From the sheer number of teams, camera angles, real-life aspects of the game (such as reviewing decisions), to the career mode, batting, bowling and fielding mechanics, etc. The whole game feels polished, despite a few minor glitches here and there.  By far my most favourite aspect of this game is the career mode. You play through twenty seasons as you take a 16 year old cricketer through the ranks from domestic cricket to the career defining call from the international selectors. Whether you get selected by your international team depends entirely on your performances on the field (it's tougher than you'd think, trust me). In fact the whole game is tougher than I expected, long gone are the days of the mannequin-style modelled cricketers belting the ball out of the park every delivery. If you try that in this game, you're guaranteed to fail fairly quickly.   Pros:  * Career mode * Online mode * Great selection of teams from the past and present * Varied amount of camera angles * Great graphics * Good commentary * Polished mechanics * More challenging than previous cricket titles. (There is, at the time of this review, no radar to indicate where the fielders are when batting or bowling. However, when batting you can briefly look around in first-person mode, which is a nice touch.  Cons:  * Licencing: No real names or brands, except Bradman, although you can get the real names of players easily by updating the teams from the community. * Can be glitchy, especially with the fielding, and strange animations at times.  * Clunky menu  Conclusion: I did not purchase this game without consideration - £35.99, or your regional equivalent, is a lot of money, but this game has been well worth the purchase in my opinion. A must for cricket fans.
9675	1	a	Best cricket game I have ever played!!!
9677	1	a	The best Cricket game out there! Made by fans, for the fans. Big Ant has really put a lot of effort to bring this game out.  There were days when I was hoping and praying that EA would put out a new game. After 2007, EA abandoned the franchise, Codemasters tried their hands on it once in a while. But, Cricket was a dead game, almost the entire community resorted to 'mods', Cricket 07 was modded to great extent to make it playable (enjoyable),   Patches to fix AI, toughen bowling, make strokes close to realistic and stuff, but nothing gave the satisfaction of a complete game.  DBC14 arrived at the scene and took it by storm, the price was high (considering I live in India, where this was close to 4k of our currency). I had second thoughts, but then I looked up the trailers, put faith in the developers and bought it.  Despite the high price of the game, which is really needed for the developers to set up a base for future titles, the game is complete. Complete in every way, except for commentary.   Pros- * CAREER MODE! * Great bowling controls * Great batting controls * Great fielding controls * Great everything * BIG head mode   Cons- * Commentary is kinda dull * Not many players to meet in Multiplayer mode.  Go ahead and buy it, you will not regret the decision.
9679	1	a	buy it its worth it great game
9681	1	a	good game on pc
9683	1	a	Best cricket game ever made.. This is a must BUY for all PC Gamers who are cricket fans...
9685	1	a	Best Cricket Game to date. Waiting for next iteration already.
9687	1	a	A decent cricket game after a long wait....If you love cricket you cannot miss this game... The AI is super at higher levels....
9689	1	a	Game play is good i means its really awesome.but some minor issues makes this game suck like batting with out ball pitch marker batting become more realistic but this game has lots of shots i mean a lot its hard to manage controls in a nick of time.batting kind of becomes a guess work if really want to play all the shots.good thing about this game is Bowling this is the best you can get but again you bowl like 20 overs in atest cricket and you dont get a wicket its really frustrating.overall its pretty good game
9691	1	a	If you are a cricket fan....then dont think and just buy it...it will worth your every penny... excellent features,physics,graphics and every thing that is included...  10/10.. thanks bigant studios for such an awesome game....
9693	1	a	One of the best cricket games out now!!  8/10
9695	1	a	Simply the best cricket game made ! Takes a while to get used to the controls but great in game physics make this a must buy for cricket fans.
9697	1	a	Yes! Finally a proper cricket game. Yes this requires a controller, but bohoo, get over it. This is an awesome game. It's hard to learn properly, but it feels like a cricket game should feel like. If you're into this sport, and have like me been looking for a more up to date experience on PC, get this.
9699	1	a	If you are a cricket fan....then dont think and just buy it...it will worth your every penny... excellent features,physics,graphics and every thing that is included...  10/10.. thanks bigant studios for such an awesome game....
9701	1	a	This right here is some top-notch next level stuff
9703	1	a	Is Don Is Good.
9705	1	a	I am crazy about this game
9707	1	a	Pros  a surprisingly detailed simulation of cricket hard to master but a lot of fun when you get it right in built support for community content   Cons: more or less equally as time consuming as real cricket
9709	1	a	Greatest cricket game ever .
9711	1	a	I don't like cricket. I love it.  Bradman 14 is the cricket game that we have been waiting for. That's pretty much all you need to know. Finally a developer has cracked the combination of making a game feel like a proper simulation of the sport. It oozes cricketness. Sure, you can play it like a hit and giggle arcade game if you want, but if you also want to make a ponderous innings in the vein of Chris Tavaré, the game is more than happy for you to go out and block every single ball back to the bowler.  The graphics are very serviceable, animations are generally good although the bowling action isn't 100% smooth, with the ball popping out of the bowlers hand at slightly odd angles, I suppose rather a tricky thing to model though when you have to allow all the variations in bowling and outcomes that result. Batting is a real joy, I love spending a while at the crease fashioning a score. And then smashing a ball down a patrolling outfielders throat having forgotten he was out there. Foolish.  Career mode is wonderful. You take control of one person. You perform their every cricketing move, if you fancy it. I generally only bother with batting myself as I am a glory hunter who prefers not to toil too hard. I've not progressed too far, but I am happy in my role as a county cricketer. One day I'll develop the patience and progress to international level. Maybe.  There's still a couple of minor aesthetic issues with the game although the devs are actively patching it at the moment. Hopefully these will get resolved.  Anyway, this review can all be boiled down to this: do you like playing cricket games on your computer? If so, buy this, you can't go wrong. Simple.
9713	1	a	Amazing Cricket Sim.  Still being updated and supported over 12 months after release. Game is well optimised.
9715	1	a	this is an amazing cricket game, i played it for 100s of hours on ps3 and can still enjoy it, this is the best cricket game i have ever played. Great graphics, more realistic, more features, its just all around better, if your looking for a cricket game you've now found the best one. I'm addicted to this game and can spend hours playing it. 10/10
9717	1	a	one of the best cricket ever.
9719	1	a	A patch already! Kudos to Big Ant for game support!!!!
9721	1	a	Good Cricket game :)
9723	1	a	why cant I play I n offline mode anymore?
9725	1	a	Best Cricket Game of all time.
9727	1	a	Best cricket game I ever played.
9729	1	a	So finally i also get DBC 2014.Its amazing game i love it too much. Only the thing is hear ting is that why DBC loose her privacy?Why its available for online play free?? Why not you control on your privacy? I paid you because i support you....for making such a amazing GAME. But when other,s peoples play free with out any cost then its heart.Do something Block those free hackable version. 
9731	1	a	As a cricket fan I have played the game for real, seen it at the top grounds in my home country, and bought various incarnations of it on the numerous consoles I have owned. When I saw this game, while browsing through the game store, my interest was peaked. I had been looking for a worthy successor to 'Brian Lara Cricket' - a great game in it's own right - and this seemed to fit the bill. I was a little hesitant about the cost, but after reading the reviews I took the plunge.  I have rarely enjoyed my first couple of hours playing a game as much as I did this one. Graphically - brilliant! Atmospherically - it's like being there. The controls are instinctive, and the ball moves dynamically depending on how the bat connects with it - as it should. I still haven't mastered the field settings but the day, as they say, is yet young. Another aspect that surprised me was the depth of history that the team choices can offer. We all have our sporting heroes and to be able to pick a team with them in it is great - even from some time ago.  All-in-all, I would highly recommend this game to all cricket fans. It is so good you can almost smell the grass. Play!
9733	1	a	Dear Sir,  I have purchase original copy of DBC Cricket 14 but the game is running very slow in my pc  Please resolve the issue immediately.  Legaly Purchase but cant update any patches how can i update new patches from stream?  Please help me for this matter   very very slow running in my pc resolve the issue sir
9735	1	a	The casual match thing doesn't work.
9737	1	a	teams must have correct players according to icc so plz correct that and remove the need of internet connection
9739	1	a	Old mate Donny B Cricket -  99.94 / 10  
9741	1	a	Game doesn't even run.  As soon as you push the start button the game just exits. What's worse is that I had to stay on the title screen for 5 minutes to be able to write this review.  Update:  The game runs in Steam offline mode, thanks for the update.  Second update:  Please don't look at the time played as I have to play the game in offline mode for now.  Awesome game, really enjoying it. Nice to have a decent cricket game again. Thanks to the developers for their quick and accurate response.  Game has a good tutorial system to teach you how to play, so far would give it a 8.5\10.  Last update:  Game now works in Steam online mode, thanks BigAnt!
9743	1	a	Not only the best cricket, but one of the best sports games period.  Pros -Career Mode and Character Creation -Cricket Academy (Allows you to mod/edit/alter players/teams/upires/uniforms etc) -Rewarding gameplay (All aspects of batting, bowling and fielding covered) -All Cricket formats covered (Test, First Class, ODI, List A, T20I, T20 etc) -Great graphics with some added filter options -Wonderful sound design including match announcers  Cons -A few small things that don't detract from the game experience I.E. Unable to change your characters batting position, bat, clothing etc once selected at the start of career mode 
9745	1	a	Graphics, game concept (Carrer Mode), level of playing are good but not very competitive and challenging after initially few weeks.  Devs have giving good precious in new stuffs like hawk eye, DRS, the stumps camera etc but graphics has disappointed. Repeated commentry lines makes me turn off my speakers while playing.  Somethings are unrealistic and frustrating, I play national game in India as well as play county game at the same time. Striker (batsman) play defensive shot of the last overs (while needing 3 runs to win of 2 balls)  Having said that, Its one of the best cricket games for PC, Good Game but needs a lot of fine tunning and more response from the developers or interactive game developers in the forums.  Tons of questions and suggestions are unanswered by them in the forums. We are kept in dark regarding the next update or what to expect in the near future in terms of game patches.  FYI, last patch was updated 3 months back, and no signs of new patches - makes me lose interest in playing these days.   Still I Would recommend the game, just for the expreince of carrer mode, seeing yourself play from club team to captaining the National team (lol in 2-3 season).
9747	1	a	Still a few bugs in this game and no where near the quality of what the 2K sports games are but for us cricket fans this is the best we are going to get.
9749	1	a	An awsome depiction of a cricket game, works like a charm. A minor thing that bugs me is how the fielders are supermen whenever i hit a shot near them but other than that love this game. Good job on this game ANT!
9751	1	a	This game is a tonne of fun. Some minor issues, AI being the biggest of those, but overall it's a great first iteration with hopefully more to come over the years. If you have loved cricket games in the past, you'll love this.
9753	1	a	Old mate Donny B Cricket -  99.94 / 10  
9755	1	a	The best Cricket game yet!
9757	1	a	Don Bradman Cricket is probably the best cricket game that I have played.    
9759	1	a	Truly a brilliant game of cricket. Sure it's not a million pounds ea sports development but it's made with care and imagination ,you might get bored quickly with the commentary Which sounds a bit like that boring bloke on the IPL if you've seen that. But there's a fantastic muted pa system in the background.... So many great features. The realistic approach towards batting, bowling and fielding is one of the biggest assets of this game which no other cricketing game was able to provide till now. Tackling license problem with smart and creative idea is just exceptional and gives a buyer an idea that how much Bigant studios are determined to give the best of this game to the users. In spite of having lack of sponsors and not having a million pounds like EA sports development have they have managed to pull off things in a great manner. However few areas where it needs advancement are Commentary it can put you off, definitely graphics can get better and better, crowd need to be alive and small glitches here and there should be sorted (Like when you get a batsman out it should come out realistic more than often its batman who leaves the ball and it hits the stump which is very rare and is not that realistic in a way.

9763	1	a	amazing cricket game
9765	1	a	I love playing this game but i think they should give bowlers more ability to take wickets 
9767	1	a	The definitive cricket game! Clearly, the creators are very passionate about the sport and it shows. Ultimately, the game is both a realistic representation of cricket and it is fun to play.
9769	1	a	Best vricket game in Ages! Still rough around the edges with regards to interface, but gameplay is fun and devs releasing updates often! Graphics are the best I have seen in any cricket game and with the ability to download player made content adding depth, I see this game being around for a while!
9771	1	a	The definitive cricket game! Clearly, the creators are very passionate about the sport and it shows. Ultimately, the game is both a realistic representation of cricket and it is fun to play.
9773	1	a	amazing cricket game
9775	1	a	thanks to the supportive staff the game runs smooth ... its the best cricket game ever!!!
9777	1	a	Awesome game. Better than any cricket game I've played. Definitely worth it! Some graphics and game physics can be improved upon but I'm not complaining.  I found a bug with multiplayer mode. When one of the controllers is disconnected, the game stops responding to the other controller. Keeps waiting for the controller to connect again. Also, I noticed that the commentry and player voices don't play sometimes. This happened for 2 entire matches. Hope the devs can get around to fixing that and release a patch.
9779	1	a	When I play the game in the amature level, I have noticed that pace bowlers of the opponant team (When I play with AI) are much slower than my pace bowlers (at least 10mph slower).  It would also be nice if there were more cricket gear options, as well as some more cricket grounds.  But dispite these few things it is a really well done game and I enjoy playing it.
9781	1	a	No finer a control scheme was ever concocted for cricket. Holding the left trigger, timing your shot and then spanking the ball in a straight-6 is weirdly exhilirating.   Commentary is a little half-arsed but it does try to emulate more successful titles (NBA 2K) and the visual presentation is lacklustre. However, the graphics and overlays at the end of the over simulate a TV style broadcast enough that they're worth watching.  Interestingly, the only licensed player is Don Bradman but the game encourages you to download 'The Community's Best' which ends up being all the official players and leagues.  Either add this one to your wishlist or just buy it outright but be warned, you MUST have a controller in order to play (no keyboard commands).
9783	1	a	Awesome game with regular update support from one of the best developers. Please do add an option of choosing between easy stroke play mode OR realistic stroke play. I am getting irritated on how each and every update, either makes the stroke play easy at the rookie level or realistic on the other patch. Many a times I play this game just to relax and would love to get an option of easier stroke play on rookie level forever untill I myself change to option to either a higher difficulty level or the realistic stroke play option.  Was playing a match, and was hitting all over the park, saved the game, shut off the pc,  next day woke up, only to see a new update downloading to play the game, and this time, the same strokes leads not even out of the inner circle with even a little bit of misstiming. I would happy accept the realistic gameplay on certain occassions and do appreciate the efforts that you put in, But no in a mood when I want to relax playing the game. Since the career of dbc14 is my one stop relaxation game since its release.
9785	1	a	I love playing this game but i think they should give bowlers more ability to take wickets 
9787	1	a	One of the best cricket games I have played.
9789	1	a	Best vricket game in Ages! Still rough around the edges with regards to interface, but gameplay is fun and devs releasing updates often! Graphics are the best I have seen in any cricket game and with the ability to download player made content adding depth, I see this game being around for a while!
9791	1	a	  Who doesn't love this game :)
9793	1	a	Excellent game. Must buy for sports fan. Not just normal cricket game where you blind smash button, you have to time your shots properly. It takes time to getting used to the controls and master the game.
9795	1	a	'10/10 to much water' 'IGN'
9797	1	a	This game is truly special if you're a cricket fan! its not perfect but considering the budget it was on it is really good, if you dont know much about cricket and you want to learn the rules this game is for you aswell! I highly reccomend this game for anybody with an interest in cricket!
9799	1	a	This is one of the nicest cricket game to come out in a while. The twin stick shot making is way better than choose-a-shot method of EA games. Bowling is also more fun than press-a-button. Especially since Spin and fast bowling uses different controls. I do wish they had the option for field radar. It does get annoying to keep looking through first person before every delivery since there really isn't any indication if there was a change in field placement. Also I really wish they would come out with a newer version of this game since it is now over two years old.
9801	1	a	This is a brilliant cricket game, by far the best I have played. Admittedly there aren’t many but this captures most elements of cricket well. The games been updated regularly and is well worth the time of any cricket fan.
9803	1	a	Absolute thriller of a cricket game, the actual best.  Only downside is that it's challenging.
9805	1	a	Big Ant Studios have crafted a very solid cricket gaming experience. Naturally it doesn't compare to the juggernaughts of FIFA and NBA 2K, but it shouldn't. It has its own distincitve visual appeal. The gameplay is the best to offer from most cricket games and the career mode is an added welcome. The only drawback is the lack of stadiums but that is a minor issue.  Great game.
9807	1	a	Awesome cricket game,i never seen such a cricket game before,Good Entertaining for cricket lover.Sound,Graphics r great.Thanks to Big Ant.If Commentators mentions the opening players name and coming to bat would be more great',It would be better if the commentators tell the real name of fielders,instead of mid-wicket has taken the catch,in the next patch.Pls add Digital score board with different colurs of score board would be better.So far no rly.thnx.Need to wait for online cricket,so it would be better to set a target post it to leaderboard then other try to get it.Pls add that option.
9809	1	a	The best cricket game but need to add keyboard controls.Its difficult to learn bowling but batting is ok.Need some more realism in IA like when left handed batsman come you should go with offspinner.In test matches batsmen play too aggresively with ODI strike rate and this needs a fix.Career mode is unrealistic as my player play every matches.The player should be dropped if is out of form and should get injured sometimes.
9811	1	a	good game and only 9 quid on ebay
9813	1	a	This is the best cricket game I have ever played. Must buy, must play.
9815	1	a	great cricket game highly recamended
9817	1	a	since brian lara cricket 1995 sega and playstaion version , I have been played almost all cricket games so far (including all ea ones ) yes ea 1999 (most pathetic one) too :) but never seen such quality cricket game as dbc 2014 is all about   DBC 2014 is something special yes, beautifully designed , excellent gameplay . even after playing for more than 100 hrs still i am unable to play pro difficulty . online gameplay ofcourse much better than other shi**** games as well.  top 3 cricket games i would say so far as follows   1. DBC 2k14 2. BLC 2k7 3. Ashes 2k9   for all cricket lovers , its my request please buy original copy . come on , within 499 INR you cant get better than this.   eagerly waiting for dbc 2k17  
9819	1	a	Fantastic...  The only aspect that could have been better... was to add advanced tutorials...  
9821	1	a	BRILLIANT GAME, best cricket game i've ever played!

Since the career of dbc14 is my one stop relaxation game since its release.
9825	1	a	I can say this thousand times but it will be less to appreciate this game. After a long time a true cricketing experience coming our way. Over all gaming expreince is new and refreshing and it makes you think about everything. There were always issues with bowling in cricket games and most of them were really bad. But in this one is a excellent approach  applied by Big Ant Games. Not only bowling looks and feeling interesting and fun, but batting is not that easy to do.  You need to play as a cricketer to enjoy the whole experience. But there are still some things which can be made better in terms of over all gaming expereice. I am sure they will be patching the bugs and make some more adjustment to enhance the game. A must buy if you have been playing crickets games all over your life. This is what you are waiting for.   Also please show your support to the team at Big Ants they have done a great job.
9827	1	a	Was a little disappointed with the need for a internet connection to play as well as requiring a Xbox Controller to play the game. As the controls ain't too complicated I've since gotten used to the controller and the graphics and realism looks good as well.   Too bad they weren't able to get actual cricketers for their commentary team though I suppose a Judo specialist and SBS soccer commentator are good enough. The customising elements of the game are great and extensive and all in all give the player the ability to play the game of cricket how, where and with who they want.   To sum it all up I would recommend this game as it is fun and to the nature of cricket there are many things that they could have improved on but Big Ant could have done a lot worse as well.
9829	1	a	Insanely fun game! A must for any cricket fan.   
9831	1	a	Great Game good gameplay. very realistic only the ambience and feel of ground is a bit mellow. Waiting for Don bradman 17 hopefully it will have pumped up audience in the IPL and limited over fixtures.
9833	1	a	I don't have too many hours played on the PC version but don't be fooled because I originally bought the game on Xbox 360 the day before official release day when the street date got broken and I've played this game a lot.  This is without a doubt the best cricket game since Shane Warne Cricket 99 and it looks so much BETTER on PC and to be honest it's probably deserving of the best cricket game ever.  I will say that bowling on higher difficulty levels can be more of a chore than a fun time and there, for me anyway, hasn't been that breakthrough from difficulty to enjoyment like there was when batting finally clicked, but I rectify this by batting as both teams and I have an amazing time.  Batting is amazing once it finally clicks, and there is a bit of a learning curve especially if you jump straight in to pro, but it will come eventually after some frustrating times. Don't let challenge mean there is no enjoyment though, in career mode I was celebrating 20 runs like I scored a century and nothing felt as good as the first 50 and then 100.  There is an amazing modding community over at planet cricket and if you're a retro lover like I am or just want the latest kits and bat sponsorship go over there right now and spend a bit of time getting the mods in to your game because the immersion that the mods brings takes this already fantastic game to a whole new level. Sometimes I just scan around the ground in awe at how great it looks.  My Career is a great addition but it is a little barebones. That's not to say it isn't fun but don't expect NBA 2K level of career either.  9/10 simply because nothing is perfect but this comes close. A must have for any cricket lover.
9835	1	a	since brian lara cricket 1995 sega and playstaion version , I have been played almost all cricket games so far (including all ea ones ) yes ea 1999 (most pathetic one) too :) but never seen such quality cricket game as dbc 2014 is all about   DBC 2014 is something special yes, beautifully designed , excellent gameplay . even after playing for more than 100 hrs still i am unable to play pro difficulty . online gameplay ofcourse much better than other shi**** games as well.  top 3 cricket games i would say so far as follows   1. DBC 2k14 2. BLC 2k7 3. Ashes 2k9   for all cricket lovers , its my request please buy original copy . come on , within 499 INR you cant get better than this.   eagerly waiting for dbc 2k17  
9837	1	a	Best cricket game ever !
9839	1	a	The BEST cricket game
9841	1	a	Best cricket game right now
9843	1	a	The only viable cricket game that exists. Game physics is really good, but after a time it becomes so realistic that the fun element just goes out. For instance rubbing the ball for swing. Agreed, it brings the game closer to reality, but it becomes too monotonous after a while. The graphics aren't great, but I am sure they will be improved in the next iteration. The camera angles also need a little reworking in my opinion. But, overall finally a game worth the wait.
9845	1	a	The best cricket game but need to add keyboard controls.Its difficult to learn bowling but batting is ok.Need some more realism in IA like when left handed batsman come you should go with offspinner.In test matches batsmen play too aggresively with ODI strike rate and this needs a fix.Career mode is unrealistic as my player play every matches.The player should be dropped if is out of form and should get injured sometimes.
9847	1	a	Best cricket game
9849	1	a	Dang, this game went above and beyond my expectations. Hands down the best cricket game on the market. The ability to create teams and players only adds to the experience. Gameplay can be difficult at first, considering so much going on. But overtime it becomes easy (as I expect most games do).  P.S. If you haven't noticed already. This game needs a controller. Unlike some previous iterations.
9851	1	a	It's a great game that allows you to follow the progress of your player from a club amateur to international captain. Despite its simplicity dbc14 makes me want to keep playing. It has a perfect balance of competition where anyone can succeed but it is still hard to master. This level of complexity is aided by the many levels of difficulty which allow the game to be played by all. The only problem I have with the game is the Ai such as your fielders missing catches or letting balls slide past through their feet for boundaries. Furthermore the umpire has left me screaming at my screen where I have hit someone for lbw plumb and the umpire still says not out even after review. Despite these minor flaws db provides hours of fun at the perfect level of competition. The perfect game for all armchair cricketers. 
9853	1	a	This is the best cricket game I've ever played. The batting is balanced: the forward defensive stroke is very safe, while the aggressive shots are likely to end in you losing your wicket - you are rewarded for playing the right shot in the right situation (as opposed to blitzing every ball for six à la EA Sports Cricket). You have little time to react to a fast ball, and split-second decisions are required, just like in real life.  The AI is reasonable - the fielding positioning is questionable, but the actual gameplay is very good. The amount of misfields and overthrows are about right compared to real life. The career mode is fantastic - you control only your player, so if you get out for barely any runs as a batsman, that's the end of your contribution for the innings: you can't then just control the next seven or eight batsman that bat after you. As a result, the games are quicker (you can simulate the bits you're not playing), and your performance is more in the spotlight.  Of course there are a few problems: the commentary is about as wooden as the cricket bats, the animations are a little bit glitchy from time to time (certainly nowhere near EA Sports Cricket or Ashes 2013 levels), and there may be a slight mismatch in run rates between the simulated and live-mode game. But these are tiny issues against an overwhelming success of a game - especially considering this is Big Ant's first try at a cricket game.  Rating: 8.5/10. Could be improved, but stands up well against any sports game ever made.
9855	1	a	Quality game if you love cricket. The career mode is particularly good and can't wait for the next one!
9857	1	a	A game that has me playing for a long time, and one that you'll never really finish because of different bowlers, batsman, fielding etc. Never truly master it. Great game, looking forward to the next one!
9859	1	a	Best Cricket Game ever  
9861	1	a	10/10
9863	1	a	Pretty much the closest you'll come to playing cricket without actually playing cricket. I am usually not a fan of sports games and have found cricket games in the past a little lame. This genre usually boils down to 'find the cheesiest method to win easy and repeat over and over'. Not this game.  Game still has some minor issues but nothing I would rate gamebreaking. In fact the only reason these issues stick out is because everything else is so brilliant.  Career mode! There's literally hundreds of hours of play there if you decide to play all the way through to retirement.  A Warning: Batting can be frustratingly difficult beyond the rookie/amateur level due to reaction times otherwise this game is beyond awesome. Bowling on the other hand is way too easy on rookie/amateur levels but starts to get realistic on pro and beyond.  Looking forward to DBC17!
9865	1	a	Awesome game, worth it! Thanks BigAnt Studios!
1401	0	a	I've been looking for a good cricket game on the PC for a long, long time and with Don Bradman Cricket 14 I initially thought I'd found it.    The Good    Bowling feels more natural than any other game I've played. Gone are target recticules that you place where you want the ball to land. In their place is a method that requires timing and finesse, and feels an awful lot more like you are actually bowling.  Batting strokes are well implemented, with the full range available to you including fancy tricks such as reverse sweeps and ramp shots. Footwork is as important to batting as it is in real life too, and if you get this really wrong then it doesn't matter what stroke you choose, you'll still be in trouble.  There are a wide variety of ways of playing the game, with all formats included. They've also got around the issue of not having any licenses by allowing you to automatically download the highest rated user mods, which quickly adds in the most important national and international teams and players. I was particularly pleased that they've included a Career mode, allowing you to take a single player all the way from local obscurity to international success.  This all sounds great right? However, after a little while a few significant issues came to light that mean I just can't make a general recommendation, as much as I want to.    The Bad    There is a massive leap in difficulty between the Amateur and Professional skill levels when you're batting. To me, this is the biggie. At Amateur level I can easily score centuries with my wet behind the ears rookie without even trying. It's so forgiving, I don't really need to concentrate much on what I'm doing at all. Switch to the next difficulty up though, and there is an enormous difficulty spike, which try as I might I just can't get over.  Don't get me wrong, I like that the game can be made that tough. Hell, I'd love to be in a position where I can work towards playing at Professional difficulty. Unfortunately, the grind and the way the game punishes you for even the slightest mistakes at that difficulty just saps any enjoyment I have, leaving me with no desire to continue banging my head against a brick wall.   There has to be some way of easing you in, some kind of halfway house that helps you grow into it. I've spent hours in the nets and in practice matches, and the feedback it gives you is helpful, but you don't get that help once you step into an actual match that matters, and the small margin for error has often left me wondering what I did wrong that got my batsman out.  Another gripe I have is the reliance on red, green and yellow to show whether a delivered ball is short, on a length or full. I know I'm in the minority here, but being partially colourblind makes this even harder. It's not bad enough that it is a deal breaker for me, but some other way of showing the difference, or even just being able to customise the colours would be really helpful.  Then there's fielding. There are a few issues here. The first is that the game doesn't provide a fielding 'radar' when you're batting, and the only way of seeing how the opposition have set the field is by going to first person view and looking around. In general I love it when a dev is this committed to realism. The problem here is I think they've gone too far. Having to do this every single time you think they might have made a fielding change is a massive drag, and becomes a real pain.  Another problem with this is the way they've implemented the camera for tracking the ball and helping you judge whether a run is on or not. A lot of the time it works, but I've lost count of when the camera angle chosen doesn't show me quickly enough for me to make a decision. In real life you'd be able to glance quickly and make a judgement, but this obviously isn't possible here.     Conclusions    This game is so frustratingly close to being amazing its ridiculous. If I wrote a checklist of all the things I want in a cricket game, this game meets almost all of them. Unfortunately, the few areas it falls short are so important, I just can't make a general recommendation.  However, I can absolutely see there is a section of the market out there that would love this, If you have faster reactions than me and/or a greater tolerance for the grind it takes to make the leap in difficulty the game presents, then go ahead and have a blast.
1402	0	a	You always have to be online for this game. ♥♥♥♥♥♥ way to handle piracy.. Please fix this big ant X( This is a rip off
1403	0	a	Good game when it doesent freeze on me all the time... and for that reason alone I would not reccommened it.
1404	0	a	The game for me didn't work and i needed a cable to connect me xbox controler and i didn't have 1
1405	0	a	Premium price for a substandard product. The editors in the game are quite powerful and featured but that's let down by the other aspects of the game. Graphics quality from the stadium models to the actual textures are anywhere from average to extremely poor. The lack of resolution options for UHD and wide screen users is disheartening (max res is 2560x1440). The menu is cumbersome to say the least and the actual game controls end up being a chore and take away any fun that is left in the game.
1406	0	a	This was a fantastic game......until buying a new PC with Windows 10 rendered it unplayable. Game would not even open, despite uninstalling, reninstalling several times. VERY annoying when you've paid money for a game that you lose after a couple of months because it's incompatible with the latest operating system. Oh well, let's hope DBC 17 is free from gremlins!
1407	0	a	 Not Recommended Because...
1408	0	a	WARNING:  You need a permanent connection online to play this game. There are also problems when connecting, even when your firewall is disabled. The developers say its a piracy issue but people without a permanent online connection will be tempted to download the pirated version to play single player mode. So read the fine print before purchasing this game.  The game is superb when getting it to play though. Its very realistic with many user options and features.
1409	0	a	I can't connect to any online game and no one can connect to the game I host. I tried it on 3 differnt connections, re downloaded the game from scratch, downloaded a beta update as I was told by Big Ant's support team. But still, the online isn't working. Also this is not the only problem, I am also not getting steam achievements. Contacted the devs and they told me that it isn't their problem that the game isn't working for me. I can play every other game online except for this crap. Big Ant fix your shiit.
1410	0	a	If you are a cricket fanatic, then yes buy away. Otherwise this game is a bit of a drag.  Whilst the gameplay mechanics are solid, with the notable exception of fielding being bloody awful, the game has some wierd design decisions.  A lot of information is withheld from you without, who's batting? what bowler are you facing? are they left arm fast, medium, slow? What condition is the pitch in? What condition is the ball in? Where are the fielders? Has the career AI captain changed my fielding set up again? (yes, yes he has) Whats the weather for the second day look like? Did my bouncer into the ribs of the batsman do anyting to unnerve them? Is it worthwhile? Should I run after hitting the ball? I don't know because the camera isn't facing the ball yet.  These are questions that you have answered in near any other cricket game. There's no point playing a career game as a bowler if you have no way of knowing what condition the pitch or ball is in, let alone that your fielding setups will occasionally change without your knowledge (minimaps guys comeon).  Some of the above info is accessible, but through many different menus rather than whilst playing it which slows an already slow game down - Except ball and pitch condition, you just have to figure out if the ball will swing or not...  Career mode is a great idea, so so much potential, but the constant loading screens and lack of information about what is happening - plus the fact that a 16 year old is just thrown into first team matches against much better players - make it so frustrating.  Great potential to be an amazing representation of cricket.. But so many odd design choices.
1411	0	a	Don't get me wrong, this is a fantastic game. I've put a lot of hours into it and I've enjoyed nearly all of them. However, I have a couple of friends who also play it, and we were looking forward to playing 2v1 online when it was announced. At no stage was it mentioned that only 2 machines could connect to a session, and as we have no way of any of us being on the same machine we can't. I understand that there's limitations on bandwidth that come with 2v2 but to only say that 2v2 online is being introduced without any mention of only 2 machines being able to connect is pretty poor in my opinion. We were also trying to get another friend to purchase it with the intention of playing 2v2, and we're glad that we tried it before hand otherwise he would have spent a lot of money on a misunderstanding.
1412	0	a	No one is available to play online becz no one is ready to accept the frnd request
1413	0	a	i loved all the old cricket games this one it to complicated. refund please!!!!!!!!
1414	0	a	The graphics need to be as clear as Ea sports cricket and the loading and internal cricket controls should have a smart synchronization 
1415	0	a	game crashes
1416	0	a	This game has so much potential but is seriously let down by the most comedy of errors.  The game advertises a '2v2' concept giving the implications that you'll be able to have a 4 player match mode, however upon discovery it turns out that its 2v2 on the same computer. So instead of 4 machines playing its 2 controllers off 2 machines.  Sub-par graphics  Awful commentary Mediocre gameplay mechanics  Honestly it's typical budget cutting from an australian developer.  Wouldn't reccommend.
1417	0	a	TL;DR – Great cricket game, poor 2014-15 sports sim title, especially when considering the price.  This is without doubt the best cricket game ever made. I have played all the EA and many Codemasters offerings from the 90s through to '11 when the last Codemasters game came out.  However, baring that in mind I cannot recommend this game. This is based on a variety of factors and especially the price. This game, as far as I am aware, has never been on sale and has stayed at £35 or $50. For that amount of money you can buy far superior sports titles that are less likely to crash, do not require an internet connection whenever you launch it and look and play better. This game has complicated controls, that aren't easy to pick up because the tutorials (last time I played) haven't been updated. The sound is just terrible, between dull and repetitive commentary (although those that like cricket might say that it is quite spot on) and poor on the field sounds I usually turn the volume off and listen to a podcast.  Furthermore, the game crashes way too much. In the past two weeks there have been a rush of patches after 6 months of silence. They made some nice changes but the whole game has been too unstable. This is especially the case considering I am not on any kind of beta channel and there is no option to only get major patches rather than the smaller ones the studio has been putting out.  The biggest issue, however, is that (based on my last playthrough) the game is NOT an accurate simulation. Between bowlers consistently bowling down leg and batsmen playing at nothing down off this is not cricket. Because it fails at its main task it is difficult to recommend the game. When including the other issues and price it is impossible, in my opinion, to give this game a passing grade. 
1418	0	a	They put in an online check, cant even start the game without it. so if you arent in range of an internet connection you are totally screwed, even for single player mode, this cuts my play time in half :( Guess this is why people end up using pirate copies, developers alienate their own player base ...  DO NOT BUY THIS, BE WARE !!!!
9867	1	a	 Blood Bowl: Chaos Edition   Many people will tell you that Blood Bowl is unfair. Other people will tell you the RNG is rigged. Yet other people will defend it with their lives. Blood Bowl is just not a game that respects you, especially if you go out there and try to win by murder. It will spank you, waterboard you and then anally invade you with spiked baseballbat that has glasshards glued on for good measure.  I have had my trial by fire on the boardgame and got butchered by experienced players. It was enough to not want to play anymore, mostly because of the discussions with the rulebook in hand. Yet, I was also constantly drawn back to it until I got absorbed by Epic and built myself a nice Eldar army. But then I got the 360 version and was hit over the head with a game that applies the rulebook to a fault. No more sneaking stuff past my opponent, no more obfuscating the rules with 'you're interpreting the rules wrong, muppet!'. Instead, I got steamrolled over and over again, until I wised up and started to take the full time allowance on a turn, always trying to get at double dice on every action that needs them. I begun to make progress, but the on-line was so horrid I turned away from the game.  Today, I decided to buy the Chaos Edition for PC on a whim. Fact is that I'm not that into GW-games anymore. I sold off my hobby some time ago, mostly because I outgrew the demographic. Whenever I walk into the GW-store, I feel like a child-molester for one and inviting a kid over to play a game of Epic just has too many negative connotations to it. Getting back in the saddle was easier than I thought, but much of that is in selecting the team that supports my play-style instead of a team that looks bad-♥♥♥ but is a dog to manage.  Blood Bowl looks very pretty to my eyes. Cyanide did not go for flashy imagery but instead kept it simple and to the point. Game music is likewise utilized and during the matches there is a duo-presentation by two dudes who sadly will have run out of new things to say after you've played a few matches.  I have not yet played with the Blitz rules, opting to play Classic-rules (Read GW-authentic) instead. The Classic-rules play by the boardgame rules and follows that ruleset to the letter, which results in nailbiting matches, as long as you play on Hard. I don't say this to be leet. On Easy, you'll win. On Medium, the AI will anally probe you. On hard, the AI gets slammed by the rules as hard as you are. How that can be, I don't know. The game was like this on the 360 too.  Winning thus depends on team-choice and choosing a team should be a factor of your playstyle. For me personally that meant a choice between the Dark Elves or the Amazons. After having tried a few games with the Dark Elves I noticed that I couldn't pull off miracle plays with them. I like to dodge and play a passing game and the Dark Elves are the proverbial team for that. (Still the best DLC I bought on the 360.) I started over, going for the Amazons this time, who all have Dodge as a natural skill. At first I felt it was hopeless, but slowly I was getting the results. After being butchered a few times, I got a handle on the Amazons and started to fight the AI to a stand-still. Some time later I managed to win a match with a miracle play, passing the ball from the midfield-line to a Catcher in the end-zone.  Blood Bowl is not an easy game. One of the first things a new player should learn is that tackle-zones are the backbone of Blood Bowl. Each pawn on the field has a tackle-zone, consisting of 8 squares around that pawn. Pawns that have overlapping tackle-zone empower eachother, making offence and defence easier. For offence, blocking an enemy pawn is a snap if it has base to base contact with other pawns that are friendly to you. For defence, understanding that tackle-zones are only good for enemy pawns entering it is key.  As you play matches, your players will level up, provided they did something that gives them points. There are many ways a player can get EXP and not all of them are obvious. Blood Bowl does however apply them according to the official boardgame rules (if you play Classic, which I recommend.) and does so rigidly. Should you ever question the game's judgement, crosscheck the decision with the ruleset, which is included in the game. I have not been able to fault it sofar. Leveling your players up will allow you to give your players extra skills. There are loads of skills, but not all of them will suit your players or your style. Take the time to read the description of skills. But most of them are obvious. The first extra skill a Catcher should get is Sure Hands. A Runner should get Sure Feet quickly. A Blitzer should keep an eye out for Break-Tackle.  Blood Bowl comes with a hefty Single Player experience. First there is the tutorial. This is scripted as heck and it won't allow you to experiment. But for new players it does open the game a little, though it won't go into specifics. Therefore it's better to play a few exhibition matches after you've done the tutorial. The Exhibition matches are perfect for experimenting, because they don't have a persistent effect on your team. Work on your starting set-up and watch the AI closely. Here you get the goods on how teams are played, which is unvaluable information for the other game-modes. Many tactics the AI employs are also good to use by you. Begin a Campaign is a set mode where you buy the team of your choice (or field one of your existing teams) and try to reach the top of the different leagues and tournies. Begin a Competion is like the Campaign, but now you set it up to your specifications before you start play. Story Mode is very different as you're free-agent coach who coaches teams that need your expertise. This time, the focus is on you and your managerial skills. And you'll be tested. Hard. World Cup is like the wolfmother of Blood Bowl. Hear you must lead your team to greatness entering nothing but tournaments and your goal is to eventually qualify for the ultimate event. All these modes can't be completed in a single evening. These modes are all in depth and content rich and successfully completing them will take your dedication and test your motivation.  Don't go into this game believing that you'll trash it on your first match. Learn from the AI, see how it handles ball-possession and see how it defends. A wise man once said that no one ever learned something from winning and nowhere is this more true than in Blood Bowl.  -Do safest actions first. -Do less safe actions second. -Do dangerous actions last. -Always guard your ballcarrier. -Buy re-rolls pre-game over stuff like Bribes and Bloodweiser Babes. -Cheerleaders and Coaches are the most helpful during kick-offs. Look for other things to buy first. -Use fouls and bribes to disable enemy keyplayers, like Catchers, Throwers and Runners. Don't waste them on rank and file. -Try to use all your re-rolls in a half, they get replenished at half-time. Re-rolls are instrumental to your play, so don't let them go to waste, use them as needed and don't be frugal with them thinking that you'll get a better chance to use them later.  I love digital Blood Bowl, but the love took a wile to take hold. Blood Bowl rewards the patient, thinking player and it really opens up to those that stick with it and gain skill. Once you get past the disappointment of playing a game that won't let you win and start to recognize what works and what doesn't, Blood Bowl is one of the more rewarding games to play.  For those that want to always win and who want to be leet 24/7, Blood Bowl has little to offer.
9869	1	a	If you like strategy and wargaming, you'll like this game. But be warned: it's hard, unforgiving, and frustrating as hell.  A lot of people buy this game without having a background in wargaming type games, and they start thinking the RNG is broken. I can understand that, because it can be frustrating to play well then get your ♥♥♥ kicked down the field because of bad dice rolls. But that's how wargames are - you're making strategy based on the odds of the rolls.  If you can get that in your head, then you can start to learn the strategies - like doubling up on blocks to improve your odds. Making use of the special skills of the various players. Changing tactics against teams based on if they pass, brawl, etc.  It took me a good 12 hours to get the hang of it, and I've been playing wargames a long time. I'm finally starting to win against the AI. I played one online game, and they other player mopped the pitch with me, so I need a lot more practice.  But if you have the patience to develop the skills, you'll find this a lot of fun (even though it's very frustrating). I also recommend looking for various online strategy guides that will help you with concepts / tactics like 'The Cage', etc. It reduces the learning curve and makes the game enjoyable sooner.
9871	1	a	This game falls in one of two categories: You will love it immensely, or you will hate it and wish you never played it.   For starters, it has a tremendously high learning curve. I've put my share of time in with both this and the legendary edition and I'm still learning new tactics. Couple that with every single team having their own specific playing style that you need to learn to a certain degree, and you have a death sentence for a new player that isn't patient enough to actually learn the ins and outs of the game.  If you can get passed that, it CAN be a tremendously fun game. There are few things more satisfying then a miracle touchdown play on the last turn of a game. It can also be so incredibly disheartening that you'll rage quit instantly. That is the nature of a game built around rolling dice though. Tragedy is around every corner.  So what is it? A sports game? Sort of. It's most accurately a competitive turn-based strategy game that isn't balanced. Some teams are specifically there for scoring and making exciting plays. Others are there to break those teams and kill as many players as possible. A third type is a gimmick sort of styled team that can be fun if you can work your way around their (potentially broken) achilles' heel.  There are 23 teams in total in this game, providing enough variety that if you feel like you're not enjoying the game, it could just be you're not playing the right team. For example, my favorite team to play is Lizards. They can bash with the best of them, but the skink ball carriers are more than capable of doing some miracle-esque types of plays that make things exciting. However, I can't stand playing with (or against for that matter) slower, more hit-aggressive teams like Orcs or Dwarves, as they don't bring as much of a high octane energy that I enjoy. The enjoyment this game brings you starts and ends with the teams you pick.   I also recommend having a friend play this with you and not just jump into a league (public or private), as that will be good practice. It will also bring less of a feeling of angst when you start, as (hopefully) either they can help you learn OR you'll learn together.   So, all in all, it can be quite fun. I recommend it, but be warned this game is not easy to play, and can be emotionally crushing if you get invested in a team only to have your star players get killed by a blown dice roll.
9873	1	a	It's Blood Bowl. What's not to like. Haven't tried the fancy 'Blitz' rules - just playing the Classic game.  If you're a fan of the 'real' Blood Bowl, but can't paint a figure to save your life (like me) or have no friends (like me) or don't have time to set up the table all the time (like me) or just want to sit down and have a quick nostalgic game of horribly wonderful how-can-the-dice-always-come-up-to-my-disadvantage-at-the-most-crucial-moment-in-a-drive (like me) - don't miss out.  Single player is surprisingly enjoyable and competitive - and there's hot-seat multiplayer, so you can deal out some Norse-style smash-mouth Blood Bowl on the big screen in the living room too.   This is Mario Kart for people who never had a Nintendo. Gratuitous swearing, cursing, beer-drinking and Pantera-listening goes very well with this game.
9875	1	a	REVIEW HAIKU  One step from the line  Your ball carrier falls down  Leaving you bitter
9877	1	a	An excellent cure for low blood pressure.
9879	1	a	Much fun, very Lil Skittles, Such rainbow, wow
9881	1	a	I was skeptical about buying this at first due to those 'unfavorable dice rolls mechanic' comments, but it's really a non-issue. The different races allow to you play whatever style you're into - ground n pound, passing, hard hitting, finesse, etc
9883	1	a	BB must be judged in two seperate ways: as a boardgame, and as a pc game. As a boardgame, it is an extremely interesting, very deep, beautifully balanced strategy boardgame. The variety of races, skills, and the fact that each team's playing style, potential and builds are truly unique and different, make it stand out. The only fact that may discourage or frustrate players, is that luck may make or break a game of blood bowl. The game is intentionally made so, that anything can fail quite miserably, or succeed quite unexpectedly, if one is lucky enough. To some players this is intense and exciting, to others it is maddening and rage-inducing. Avoid, if you count yourself among the latter. In general, it is one of the most interesting boardgaming experiences one may have.  As a pc game, it does have some advantages. It is pretty solid, and the multiplayer works excellently - it is relatively easy to find an opponent, and many times, even if one player loses connection momentarily, it succeeds in reconnecting. The community is usually friendly, and bad manners aren't that common. On the negative side, everything other than the online multiplayer is laughably bad. The game doesn't feature any interactive way to teach you the rules of BB - of which there are many - and you have to learn them by reading the pdf rulebook. The single player campaign's AI is horribly bad; so bad, that playing vs AI has no value whatsoever, as the computer's moves are illogical, and the team builds it uses are unorthodox and usually worthless. Blitz mode is amazingly awful and doesn't deserve looking at.  Concludingly, I would say, BUY THIS GAME. But only if you are fully aware what you're getting into: a deep, complex, multiplayer strategy boardgame with a steep learning curve. Oh, and visit  bbtactics.com , it will make starting up a lot easier. Good luck, have fun.
9885	1	a	Blood Bowl is an adaptation of a tabletop game by the same name that was created by Games Workshop. It takes place in an alternate version of the Warhammer Fantasy universe where all of the races decide to settle their differences playing games of American Gridiron Football.  Much of the aesthetic of Blood Bowl was nailed perfectly. The look of the more general races like the Humans resemble 1950's caricatures of Football players. While the more fantastical races like the Undead look like mummified quarterbacks. There's a significant amount of content in this release, with a total of 23 races. Each with their own unique roster of players and distinctive gameplay balance.  My favorite aspect of Blood Bowl is it's extensive singleplayer experience that also appears in the multiplayer. If your players get injured this carries over into subsequent matches, and if they die you lose them forever. Your players also level up and gain Fallout style perks. It reminds me a great deal of strategy games like X-Com. The entire game is turn based and every action in the game is determined through rolling a 6 sided die. It is a surprisingly faithful recreation of the original tabletop game, which puts off a lot of players as a result.   Blood Bowl gets frequently referred to as an 'RNG game with a mix of strategic elements'. Which I personally disagree with. The random elements to the game make the game stand out to me compared to a lot of other strategy games. Where you can have a player void his entire turn because of a botched pass, forcing you to adapt. The meta of the game as a result revolves around minimizing the amount of rolls you might have to make, taking full advantage of your teams strengths. Because of these random elements, succeeding with a plan feels much more earned than it normally would be in any other strategy game. You feel that Ork score a touchdown, you feel your team win a tournament. It all feels really good when you win.   Which brings me to my criticisms of the game. While Cyanide did a hell of a job adapting the rules, the game doesn't really explain very core fundamentals. Things like the balance between the races, roster selection, and even what particular plays are more effective over others. Blood Bowl is a game that requires practice and most importantly patience. You won't fully learn the game without losing several matches and clocking in upwards of 10 hours into it even. It takes a lot of reading guides and practice to really understand how to play it.   But that's one of the most satisfying aspects of Blood Bowl. To me it's a turn based strategy game that's willing to anger you, that's willing to grind your teeth, that's willing to paint facepaint on your cheeks and dump Gatorade down your throat. This game is one of the finer examples of injecting variety into an otherwise bland sports game, and it really makes you feel like you're playing it in both body and mind.  One last thing to note is the 'Chaos' edition to the game is the complete version, with more content than the Legendary edition. While you can play online with players from the Legendary edition, it comes highly recommended to get this version to recieve the full experience.
9887	1	a	Makes you hate that dice all the time.
9889	1	a	Considerably cheaper than the table top version.
9891	1	a	If one of your players dies on your first turn, you're doing it right.
9893	1	a	If you like Blood Bowl or playing games with turn based strategy you must play that game, you'll love it. If you have not ever played Blood Bowl you should try with this version, keeps the spirit of the game with a great diversity of races and units, with a lot of explanations about the rules. Remember you can download the rules on pdf at the internet for free. There are two ways to play a match: classic (as the original) and 'not turn based', I´ve only played classic one so I cannot talk about the other system. I really recommend it.
9895	1	a	Incredibly steep learning curve. Oh yes indeedy. If, like me, you have never played blood bowl on the tabletop then be warned, you will be smashed down harder than you have ever been smashed down by a video game.   Despite that, once you get the hang of it, it does become very fun. You might even win and those wins, oh boy those glorious wins. Campaign mode is the best underdog story you'll ever see (with your team as the underdog) and story mode will test you to the point you rage quit over and over and over.  Killed a bloodthirster with a skink 10/10. 
9897	1	a	This game is a ton of fun, though it's vast ruleset can be intimidating at first. It's based on a somewhat high level table top board game and plays out like one in video game form. Blood Bowl is a game of incredible depth and takes a serious amount of time to learn to do it well. But if you do take that time and understand that this game is all about managing risk, you'll find it very rewarding in a reasonable amount of time.   While it might seem like a relaxing sit-back-and-click type take on the sports genre, it's rather tense. Building your own teams, naming the players, and leveling them up has you second and third guessing each decision. These players become extensions of you to a point, and risking them can be difficult! The emotional and strategic depth in this game is unlike anything I've experienced. I can't reccomend it enough for fans of table top board games or fans who might be into a sports/rpg hybrid.  I had played Blood Bowl 2 on the consoles first, which gives you a pretty good understanding of the rules and the risks involved. This version is much more complete, with many more races to choose from than BB2. Like more than twice more. The graphics aren't as good but this game runs well even on my old beatup laptop. And it doesn't look bad. The controls and interface is fantastic as I always feel like I'm making the move I want to make.   I know some of the negative reviews seem to be people who had frustrating dice rolls. I promise that this game was never meant to be that hard. It's supposed to be a deep table top board game at it's core, but it's not supposed require hours and hours of research before playing. You will fail, but as long as you can understand why you fail in a rather short time you'll learn the rules pretty quickly. I'm not the biggest fan of table top games in the world and I managed to learn the rules.   Pro tip: If you want additional resources theres a YouTuber named cKnoor who has excellent beginner and intermediate level strategy videos. They helped my game immensely.
9899	1	a	This is the best version of Bloodbowl. Bloodbowl 2 may have the graphics, however this has many more teams, and less issues. i would recommend this over the newer version, and a bargain at the price for any bloodbowl fan, despite the bugs, and issues with matchmaking. However this does still feel like an incomplete release
9901	1	a	Best game ever. I run my own league. Great times. Awesome people. Feel free to join up with us... Send me a message if you are interested. New player's are welcome. Keeping this short and sweet!   As a review... Buy it if you are intelligent. If hard games ♥♥♥♥ you off... The game is not for you.
9903	1	a	Blood Bowl is a game that exists. You can play this video game, if you wish. In this video game, you command a bloodthirsty team of muscular men or busty women or weird monster things or a combination of all three and have a friendly toss-about of the old pigskin with another team. Oh sure, occasionally someone's arm breaks, or their eyes are gouged out, and in certain circumstances a player dies, but these are all minor details to be overlooked.  This is a turn based take on American Football with fantasy teams and themes, accompanied by an ungodly amount of violence, cursing and Big Moot sandwiches.  I'm not sure what more to say. It's an incredibly fun game solo and it's an incredibly fun game with friends, and a very nice take on the tabletop original game, bringing more content to a more accessible medium of gaming. Games also don't take nearly as long and the game does all of the tedious dice rolling for you. No, the game doesn't hate you, the dice does. No, it's not rigged. No, you can't roll the dice yourself. No, it's not the game's fault that your wood elf failed his dodge and is now laying on the ground with his spine shattered in several places. It's your fault. You ♥♥♥♥ed up. Get good. Get Blood Bowl!  ..  God, that was awful. 10/10 game though.
9905	1	a	This game is absolutely irritating and nerveracking. It will cause you mental instability and it will laugh as every single one of your players fall over dead. But it is fantastic.
9907	1	a	If you want a great Blood Bowl experience, buy this one, not the new one. This is inexpensive, has 23 teams, great single player support, decent multiplayer, and a faithful adaptation of the board game. Plus you can modify the game settings using a variety of house rules.
1423	0	a	This is Blood bowl: exactly the same as all the other games before except for a couple of minor, barely noticable changes as well as 3 new teams into the mix. Definately the best version so far, but thats only because of the tiny bit of extra content. Each of these games costs around $30, so if you have previous versions it's not worth getting this one. If you don't then I'd say wait for a sale; this game is NOT worth $30.
9909	1	a	I have never played Tabletop Bloodbowl so I will not compare the two.  Blood Bowl: Chaos Edition takes American Football, throws the rulebook out the window and adds in the Warhammer universe. All while your fate is decided with the roll of the dice..  This is like the ultimate luck simulator. Sometimes ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t plays work... sometimes they don't and you have the worst match in your life.  This is a good game to play with friends or in a small community. Public leagues are ok, but I feel you can have more fun with the first.  I throughly recommend this game. 8/10 Gabemas GabeN
9911	1	a	4.5 Stars - A turn based american football style game adapted from the Warhammer Universe  I had never played the board game but was instantly impressed by this game. The turn based games can punish errors quickly but the game is won when willingness to take risks and luck come together. This is all backed up with player experience, team cash management and the risk of injury or death to any participants.  The many teams can offer different plays styles from ball handling finesse to simply bashing the enemies heads in. Game play is dice controlled and nuffle can be dangerous.  Overall I enjoyed slugging away at the matches and experiementing with different team builds. I made my own strategies and really enjoyed getting my skills mix right to back this.  Pros - Turn based tactival games Team Development  Cons -  Punishes Error Matchmaking delay time
9913	1	a	This game is so much fun. It takes some time and energy to understand what's going on, but there's a deep and engaging system to learn here. Great for anyone who likes sports and wargames. I love all of the variation between the different teams and all of the options available to customize your players as they advance. The fact that they can get permanent injuries and die adds to the suspense.  The company who makes it is shady to have put out so many similar releases just to add extra teams and looks to be even shadier in the future to make people pay for individual teams with the sequel. You might be better off to just buy this complete game rather than get bled over time as they hold back content.
9915	1	a	Yes this game is not new. Yes it has bugs. Yes AI suck as hell. But still its best thing I ever bought on Steam. Awesome, fun and highly entertaining. It will take hours and hour from your life.  Just don't play with AI, play with other human beings.
9917	1	a	It was fun losing against the AI for the first week of playing but creating the teams was fun  Best losing simulator 2015
9919	1	a	I can highly recommend BBCE, but anyone should know its a board game and dices are thrown, so some games can go weird and you gotta love this or end up being frustrated. Everyone who understands that, is able to calculte his chances and can still laugh if dice outcomes go weird will have LOTS of fun. While writing this i have more than 2300 hours spent playing or watching Blood Bowl games that says much about the potential of having fun. Best way to play it for me is looking for private leagues and getting to know your opponents, so talking to them while playing makes it more of a board game again...  The only downsides are: some connectivity issues in MP for some players now and then a few bugs never got patched out running your own leagues you often miss some better administration options  But these are few and the amount of races to play and fun you have makes it up.  Since nobody knows how long the servers will run, buy it on a sale and it can still be a great catch.  (written 12/2015) 
9921	1	a	Hmmm... lets see now -lots of teams to choose from? check! -Many skills to change the play style of your team? Check! -Announcers that sometimes say the same stuff over and over? Check! -Sweat, blood and angry? Check!!!! -WHEN YOUR ELVES ROLL A BAD ROLL AND YOU GET A ♥♥♥♥ING TURNOVER AGAINST A NURGLE TEAM!!!! ♥♥♥♥ING CHECK!!!! ... ahem Its a nice game and if you like to lose and lose to al and lose even more to the small player base veterans then give it a shot.
9923	1	a	HOLY CRAP THIS GAME ROCKS! If chess and rugby and warhammer had a baby it would be this game. Bought it awhile ago on a sale and finally had enough free time that I thought I could learn this game and boy am I glad I did. My 24hr time at the writing of this is from 2 days of playing thats how instantly addicted I got to this.   Just finished a game in campaign Goblins vs Orks(me) First turn I am kicking off Get blitz KO their pogoer in the free blitz turn get 2 TDs by turn 6 by halftime all their secret weapon players have been removed by ref and they have 2 injured players so 5 man out for game they only have 11 players left by turn 14 I get 3rd TD and one more is injured and one more KO score is 3-0 Uru-Krush wins again  23 races how can you go wrong?! way better than any real sport game I have ever played. Just takes about 8 hours to get the hang of playing and then fun times ahead.
9925	1	a	Buy this over Legendary Edition if you're looking for Blood Bowl 1.
9927	1	a	It's fun if you've never played the board game version and quite useful if you have.
9929	1	a	Not a bad game . Few bugs , but a vibrant communauty of players. It s a niche market game. Adaptation from a tabletop game , the players will keep the game alive way past it s due date. worth the investment for the long run  
9931	1	a	Blood Bowl: Chaos Edition isn't much different from the Legendary Edition, though I understand most people recommend buying Chaos Edition if you haven't purchased either. They have some extra races included.  Blood Bowl is Games Workshop's blend of American Football and Rugby, and is a faithful recreation of the tabletop boardgame. Pick a race, recruit players, and have them all killed on the field by Chaos Dwarves during your first game.  BB is arbitrary, with good strategy only able to minimize the punishing dice rolls. Embrace the chaotic nature of your plans going awry, your Catcher with Sure Hands, Nerves of Steel, and Block dying at the hands of a zombie because you rolled 3 skulls and have no team re-rolls left, and watching a Gutter Runner go nearly the length of the entire field to score.  Because if you're lucky, you'll catch that little rat on the next play and break his neck, ending his career forever.  Not for the faint of heart or those who care that the dice are brutal and don't care about you.  For: people who enjoy NFL Blitz, watching Orcs beat down hapless Wood Elves, and anyone who can handle losing because the dice didn't go your way. Lots of fun.
9933	1	a	Fun, but immensely hard. Only worth it in multiplayer, though, because the single player matches are really weird and I'm not even sure what the devs were thinking with them. You start out with an incredibly basic team against what essentially amounts to supermen in the single player. Really annoying. Multiplayer is great fun with friends, though.
9935	1	a	Violent Competitive Carnage and some sports... ;)
9937	1	a	If you've never played Blood Bowl before, there is a strong learning curve. VERY stong. Once you get the hang of it, this game is fantastic, although there is the odd bug now and then, but nothing serious.  What ever way you decide to play, bashy, running, throwing, or defensive, there is a team for you. The fact that you get to level up your players makes the strategy all the more intense!  All bow to Chaos!
9939	1	a	Game is excellent and the comunity is welcoming and you will find many seperate leagues where others will be willing to teach you the basics and join ongoing leagues
9941	1	a	Best electronic version of the table top game.
9943	1	a	A bit hard to get the hang of, but a lot of fun when you do!
9945	1	a	Respectable adaptation of the tabletop turn-based strategy game from the Warhammer universe. It has its own weird quirks, but once you learn the system, its worth it. NOBODY plays real-time. Just don't.
9947	1	a	The only warhammer game I play :)
9949	1	a	A description? Extreme death chess with added infuriating dice rolls.
9951	1	a	 http://polarisportal.info/bloodbowl/season_2/videos.html 
9953	1	a	A description? Extreme death chess with added infuriating dice rolls.
9955	1	a	This game is infuriating! Sometimes for you, sometimes for your opponent. Take some time to learn how it works and have fun for months.
9957	1	a	There is no game like this game. It's freaking awesome! It does have some mistakes and bugs (come on Cyanide it can't be that difficult to fix some bugs) BUT... it's the ultimate board game ever! Play it first against the AI, then against people on-line and after... Join a tournament online to explore the total awesomeness of this masterpiece!
9959	1	a	Great fun to play with friends, Blood bowl 2 comes out Spring 2015 so you might want to wait till then. 
9961	1	a	There is no game like this game. It's freaking awesome! It does have some mistakes and bugs (come on Cyanide it can't be that difficult to fix some bugs) BUT... it's the ultimate board game ever!

9963	1	a	Great fun to play with friends, Blood bowl 2 comes out Spring 2015 so you might want to wait till then. 
9965	1	a	Given enough time and practice, Blood Bowl can be a highly rewarding experience. Where else can you watch in horror as your 9' foot tall minotaur gets tackled into a raging crowd by a halfling?
9967	1	a	Stomped a player on the ground and got ejected from the game... 10/10  Alot of people say this game is all about luck and rage alot in so many reviews but I brought it anyway and I am glad that I did. Its great fun to play!!  I lost so many matches at first until I watched some games on twitch and realised the game is not about taking chances and taking risks... The game is about RISK MANAGEMENT, forcing your opponent to take the risks and then punching the crap out of them when they pushed their luck and dropped the ball...  This game is really good fun once you understand blocking, setting up players in key positions and protecting the ball when you have it.. the tutorial is crap watch 2 or 3 games on you tube instead then trash the other team with a smile on your face..
9969	1	a	This is a board game simulator. Some of my friends who never played the board game have tried this and they hate it. I used to play the board game when I was young and I love this. It is good fun and very easy to organize online leagues with friends.  
9971	1	a	Fan of warhammer and love breaking peoples hopes and dreams? Thats what i thought, buy and enjoy the bone crushing action with all the Strategy of the board game
9973	1	a	It's one of my 'go to' games when I get bored. It's an interesting game, but you have to be prepared for failure as the odds are amost always in favor of failing... But that's how Game's Workshop games are. To properly enjoy the game you have to accept that you might lose or that a play won't go favorably. It's definitely a game about minimizing your chances at failing, it's part of the strategy and you can use it against your opponents.  Personally, I like playing the Ogre team. They don't seem like a serious team, but fielding 6 big guys really puts the hurt on the enemy team. Every injury is like an extra point in my book.
9975	1	a	Its not a perfect translation of the board game buts its the best availible. The convinence of being able to play from home instead of driving to the game store every week makes the game so worth it.
9977	1	a	You have a few bugs that'll never get tended to and this game is definitely not going to get anything else but if you've played the tabletop board game then this is a pretty true renactment. The singleplayer's AI is no good for practice against multiplayer and truely only shines when you do multiplayer.  Overall, a good game with active leagues besides the Cyanide sanctioned ones -- Try out Naggoroth open first before you do Auld league!
9979	1	a	If you're a fan / veteran of the classic Blood Bowl board game or just looking for really destruction induced mayhem in a quasi-football related strategy game, then this is worth the download. For vets, this game is EXACTLY like playing the Games Workshop lunacy we fell in love with....
9981	1	a	Blood bowl Chaos edition is a great digital edition of the classic blood bowl board game. would recomend if you are a fan!
9983	1	a	This Game is wicked!!! It is like the tabletop game came to life. It is very challenging.
9985	1	a	A nice addon for Blood Bowl. The new gamemode brings a lot of fun, if you're a fan of league gaming against a.i.  The jungle stadium looks more detailed than the old ones, and the new teams are a nice addition and fun to play. But unfortunately its only a single new arena and the teams are not well ballanced. Especially the Khorne demons are totally op. Also the full price is way to high for this.  If your a fan of Blood Bowl and get a budget price, i can recommend Chaos Edition.
9987	1	a	First, I hate the Skaven. If you play Skaven I hate you too, you have an enemy for life! Second is that BB is awesome and you shoud play but not as the Skaven. You have nothing better to do anyway. See you in the Bowl.
9989	1	a	A fun game but at the same time one of the most infuriating games i've played in years...  You can have games where the rolls just don't go your way and you are spitting feathers but then you can have a run of good luck (Like injuring your opponents best player with a cheeky stamp while they are down).  The community from what i've seen seems friendly enough and willing to help and i'm yet to encounter a bad winner.  Rolls can and will go against you, teams will make plays that are so lucky you want to claw your eyes out, but the same can happen for you...  All in All a fun but such a deep game, not something you can get good at quickly, read up on guides how to build your team...
9991	1	a	Fun! Fun! FUN!  It's quite close to the board game and I am enjoying it more then I expected I would. The RNG is erratic, true, but if you remember the board games you play then I am quite sure double one or two skulls were no rarity (especially if you roll a lot.) Besides, the opponent suffers from terrible luck occasionally as well. I remember a necromantic team needing four turns to pick up the ball *snickers* and an ogre team with three of six ogres being boneheaded.  If you liked the board game I highly recommand this game as well.
9993	1	a	Absolutley Bash 'em Smash 'em Fun !!!
9995	1	a	Such blood, much bowling. Would play again, tenouttaten.
9997	1	a	Insanely fun when it isn't mindshatteringly infuriating. This is not a shortcoming of the video game: it's just part of Blood Bowl.  Anyone who knows the meaning of the phrase 'double skulls' knows that X-COM ain't got ♥♥♥♥ when it comes to making the best laid plans gang aft agley.
