1	1	a	This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:  I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over. He didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a such an experience. Playing public servers with mods were very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse. Looking at the current e-sport scene it might not seem like much but back then it was different.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.   I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games. It's harder though.

5	1	a	No r8 revolver, 10/10 will play again.
7	1	a	cant buy skins, cases, keys, stickers - gaben cant steal our money 10/10 would play again
9	1	a	Every server is spanish or french. I can now fluently swear in both languages 9/10
11	1	a	I never played a better first person shooter. Graphics doesn't matter for gamer, gameplay only.
13	1	a	CS is one of the greatest and undermined games in history. It is, in my opinion, the best  game to ever have a crosshair. It is not a contact sport, so for the girly girls, it is an activity to indulge in.  It starts off with a team trying to kill another team.   I started playing cs when I noticed jacking off isn't the only activity to do on a computer. I started inviting a lot of friends out and getting drinks, as well as a boom box, to spend a nice summer day in the living room playing this wonderful game. I wanted to play every chance that i could. On my road of cs adventures, I encountered a couple of problems; those being that nobody was as fervent as I was about playing, and that when we did play, nobody was good enough, so it wasn't a lot of fun.  Then I discovered that I could sign up for a class with dboorn. I was overly excited, and signed up, but with skepticism at how the class was going to be. Sure enough, I was proven wrong. We started off by practicing a little bit. Then we split off into teams and started playing almost everyday of class. I made some friends, and played with people who had built up their skill gradually over the period of the course.  When I play counterstrike, the whole world disappears. Only I, the mouse, and my teammates remain. We are united in a common goal. We strive collectively towards an end we all desire. Each player has a spot to hold. They stand ready and waiting, eager for their chance to aid the team in what they hope will be a forthcoming victory. Thus, CS celebrates the unity of man, the indomitable spirit in all of us that pushes us and drives us towards excellence. When I play CS, I play until my veins pump battery acid, and then I play some more.  CS is unique among the games because it teaches all of us that no matter where we are in life, there is a role for us to play, and we can help our fellow man by fulfilling that role, and thereby our destiny. What destiny might you ask? I spoke before of unity. And it is that unity that brings us all together like one big loving family. That is the nature of counter-strike; the many working as one. One machine made of well oiled cogs and wheels, moving in unison, happy to play their part in the production of something greater than themselves. Not that these small metal objects are actually animate, I'm of course speaking only metaphorically.  Over the course of the years, I have increased in skill, but I have learned a greater lesson than how to be a better cs player. I have learned how to cooperate with a team to accomplish a goal that we all share. Even if that team is less than ideal. I have realized that cs is about more than just one's athletic ability. Instead, there is a deeper meaning behind the colt, the AK, the AWP, the deagle, the sands under my feet (in d2 or inferno). And more importantly, the teammates at my side. I love them. It is the human element of cs that gives cs its greatness.  In conclusion, I love cs. I love to win. I love pushing myself to my physical limits. It's that feeling that first drove me to the computer. For every second that I am not playing cs, there is only an unquenchable thirst to play. A thirst that grows as every minute passes by when I am outside, sitting at the television, or playing sports. I had an extraordinary time playing this game, and I will return to look at the future students of this game to see that bright eager look on their faces to remind me of how I used to feel. This review may be over, this game may be dead, but I will never stop playing couner-strike (1.6).
15	1	a	I met a lot of people who slept with my mother. 10/10
17	1	a	When you crouch, you lift your feet in the air and fall to the ground. It's allright.
19	1	a	One of the best FPS Games, the 1.6 Version will stay always in our hearts. I recommend it vor everyone who wants a tactical/action shooter.
21	1	a	Playing it since 2010. Still bad at it.   10/10 Best game in CS series.
23	1	a	Blame this game for the rise of the online multiplayer modern military shooter. Good game, great custom maps, terrible community. Not much has really changed since 2000, has it?  I don't think anyone still plays this particular version of CS though.  Edit: Wait, there are over 8,000 people in-game right now. Wow... guess I have to give this a 'yes' then because it isn't dead.
25	1	a	Best game ever! Started my gaming addiction :D
27	1	a	Playing this game since 2001. It ruined my life. Five stars.
29	1	a	Well, look at my hours played you can already tell if it's a good game or not.         (YES IT IS)
31	1	a	WE WONT FORGET 1.6
33	1	a	First of all its my first online game ever. I was very young and i was playing with my friends LAN matches sometimes for fun sometimes with bets the loser treats refreshments. xD This game its the reason that i maked my mum to buy me a PC to playing this game at my home. With the time i learn how to modding on CS 1.6 servers,plugins and more stuffs about PC. After this i learn how to aim on the enemy head, how to fire inside the walls, how to hear someone with his steps and HOW TO FIGHT!!! I have played many FPS(First Person Shooter) Games that they called me hacker of my fast killing. I had so fyckin good and bad moments on that game that i will not forget never. For others its only a game for me it was MY LIFE! This wasnt a review but a little story.  SO COUNTER-STRIKE FTW â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ES!!
35	1	a	   Old but Gold.   
37	1	a	  Pros  - No crates which you can waste your money. - You don't pay for the extra maps. - Less Russians. - Less cheaters. - Very alive game (after 16 years). - More than 11, 000 active servers (according to Gametracker).  - You don't need actually PC to play this (you can run it on a Calculator). - More mods than games on Steam. - You can spray in the game. - You can buy MP5. - You can use Flashlight and Nightvision. - You can choose a character. - You can play Assassination mod. - You can use Bunnyhop. - You can play CSGO MOD.  And other stuff I can't remember....
39	1	a	I only write this because of how nostalgic I feel. The game that gave me my passion for shooters. Hands down, in my opinion, best game made in history.  This game, I cannot explain how many emotions it gave me, and thousands or millions of other players.  Cs 1.6, please stay alive.   Pros- Everything Cons- Nothing
41	1	a	10/10 Would get 'Fire in the hole' tattooed on my â™¥â™¥â™¥.  Again.
43	1	a	'The original Counter-Strike is the raw, uncut cocaine of shooters' - Honest Game Trailers
45	1	a	I tried it a few times.
47	1	a	Counter-Strike is a great series. Though the real change they made was in CS:GO, Counter-Strike has been one of my favorite FPS games of all time. If you prefer a fast based shooter, this game isn't for you.  Counter-Strike can have exciting moments where it's you VS 5 others, or where you have no defuse kit with only a few seconds left to defuse the bomb  A comparable version of Counter-Strike's defuse gametype is the Call Of Duty 'Search and Destroy'
49	1	a	Compared to CS:GO, this is pure gold. Joined a French server where I asked if they could speak english, and they did. Someone said no rush and everyone listened. The community is way more friendlier and the game isn't about how volvo can make more money.
51	1	a	The First Crush , You Just Cannot Forget Her
53	1	a	After 17 years (13 if you want to count from 1.6 steam) there's still 2976 servers running.   Nuff said.
55	1	a	This game will never get old &lt;3
57	1	a	There's nothing to say about this... :)   Legend  
59	1	a	This game is unlike the other counter strike games. This game requires a different type of skill. You have to become used to the recoil each weapon has. You also have to become familiar with the different advantage points of each map. I personally think this is the best counter-strike game.
61	1	a	I've had lots of fun with this game. Graphics are outdated but community is still here to support it.
63	1	a	Ah, this is where it all started from.. The mecca of online competitive scene.. I still remember bunking my extra classes, and play this game in a bunker of a gaming center, during my school days. I didnt think, that it would take root inside of me, that would fruit up, some years later.  Come the post graduation years, and I found myself playing this again, this time.. on a competitive level and making sure I had fun, the entire time I spent, whistling away at this ..  Fond old memories.. Still growing strong.. Still making more and more, as we keep walking through the life..
65	1	a	If you dont like 1.6 then you can suck some balls
67	1	a	Graphics is not everything! :) Old school love.
69	1	a	Counter-Strike is a first-person shooter game from Valve, the first of the Counter-Strike series.  Play the world's number 1 online action game. Engage in an incredibly realistic brand of terrorist warfare in this wildly popular team-based game. Ally with teammates to complete strategic missions. Take out enemy sites. Rescue hostages. Your role affects your team's success. Your team's success affects your role.  Counter-Strike is a round based game where you play as counter terrorist or play as terrorist. As a counter terrorist, your task is to prevent the terrorist from planting a bomb and detonate it or rescue a captured hostages and lead them to the hostage rescue zone, while the terrorist team has to do the opposite. Weapons has hard recoil so you can't just spray and pray, short burst fire can save you in critical situation. Before the round begins, you can and need to buy weapons and equipments with money, you get money by winning the round or killing the enemy team. This type of gameplay encourages team work.
71	1	a	*Goes in-game *Sets server requirements *Joins a server *Empty *Joins another server *Cursed at in rapid Spanish *Asks for tips, says 'I play CS:GO' *Gets cursed at some more *Gets a kill *YOU HAVE BEEN KICKED FROM THIS SERVER*
73	1	a	One of my all time favourite games! You never get bored playing this. You may not find its graphics to be very cool as per today's standard; but, old is gold!
75	1	a	This game is awesome.  + still a lot of full servers from all countries  + you can find many friends in this game  - Unbelievable ugly graphics (â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ that. this game is 15 years old. )
77	1	a	2k9 --&gt; 2k16 :'(  So much time, a lot of memories :'(
79	1	a	This game appears to remain No. 1 FPS Action games since 2000 for around 8 to 11 years. It is a intense game as your health and your exposure is important as well sticking together with your team mates at all costs. You should maybe try this game and learn the routes in common CS maps like dust or assault. Go on try it!  However they are a several downsides to this game like the weapon nerfs like the recoils and smoke grenade failing to detonate airborne and the lame Tactical Shield. And cos this game is so popular that thousands of servers host this game online, that some PC criminals tend to take advantage on players like using hacking or server addon hacking materials. So you maybe best to stay clear of weird or dodgy servers with extreme adult material and Steam cannot unban victims who got hijacked and VAC banned, so please be careful!  But if you are old and wise enough to handle this intense action game...BUY IT, SOLDIER!
81	1	a	More than 15 years and yet best FPS ever made.
83	1	a	Wordless.... very very good.

93	1	a	gods creation
95	1	a	Best FPS game of all time. It's a shame only a few people still play it. Great for older Counter Strike players and newer ones to experience what older players had with this game :) This is where Counter-Strike is love Counter-Strike is life really have a meaning.  After several thousand hours in the game I still love and cherish it. A must have for any FPS player out there.
97	1	a	Pillar of Online FPS gaming.  This game will never die no matter how many new versions are launched :)
99	1	a	The â€œTest of Timeâ€ Award  This award is for the game that is just as good today as the day you first played it. Newer games may come out, but it doesnâ€™t matterâ€¦ youâ€™ll always come back to play this one.  ;)
101	1	a	Dropping in an old review here. Always a fun game but too bad the newer versions has taken over.
103	1	a	While people are outside playing Pokemon GO I'm playing a real game.
105	1	a	I still remember this from my childhood, It was the first FPS game that I ever played in a computer.  8.5/10
107	1	a	I don't like because Steam blocked redirections from server to server. I know that people using it to slowhack, but now... servers with redirection are unusefull..  Also, VAC not working good for Counter-Strike 1.6. Maybe it could be good for some update, or something...   I can give you anything you need for it.  Contact me.  Kinds and Regards, drag1c.
109	1	a	Such a highly reccomended game for those who want to get it, playing this game in 2016 reminds me of the old style games i used to play on the playstation 2.  I recently came back to play this game due to the fact Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is simply a great game and wanting to seen the origin.  10/10
111	1	a	I've never met so many Brazilians in my life! 10/10
113	1	a	Old good game never dies.  I remember first time playing this game when I was in elementary school. Hiding teacher to play this game with friends is very fun, you should let your kid have experiences like this.
115	1	a	Best competetive game of all time.
117	1	a	Nice game
119	1	a	This game is just amaizing. If you have a game with cheaters then change the server with admins that actualy do stuff right like cs.kopideja.lv  Yes The graphics are outdated and the physix may make no sense but this is what started it all... If you havent played this and you play other CS games then you know nothing about this game... Buy it play it and enjoy  For me this game is more fun than CS:GO or CS:S because its calssic and was a my favorite childhood game 10/10
121	1	a	A must have classic.
123	1	a	  miss this game â™¥
125	1	a	Think you got skills because you came from CS:GO?  Think you got skills cause you came from COD?  Think you got skills cause you just bought fallout 4 and still got money left on your steam account?   Well let me tell you a story.         You're going to suck â™¥â™¥â™¥.       Alot of â™¥â™¥â™¥.
127	1	a	Perfect for anybody who like shooter game. Just be careful when searching server though.
129	1	a	best bhops 2003

133	1	a	Consumed my teen years. LANs lans and more lans. Memories.
135	1	a	Counter-Strike was the game that changed everything for me in FPS games, coming from older games like the FPS Game Blood back in (1997) when I was only 10 years old and Half-Life, Counter-Strike changed everything for me it was litterally the best thing ever.  The quality of the game was never about the visuals for me but about the game play and performance and Counter-Strike litterally had it all in my opinion.  Even today after so many years, I occasionally come back and play Counter-Strike just because it is one of the greatest Counter-Strike versions flat out, anyone disputing this are most likely people that started playing either Counter-Strike: Source or Counter-Strike: Global Offensive first then tried Counter-Strike but if you played it in the right order there is no disputing this, because this game might frighten most the new generation that has expectations to visual graphics having to have a certain standard before they will even touch it.  Counter-Strike is not about the visuals, that is just a bonus, if you want visuals then you probably playing the wrong game, Counter-Strike was never Battlefield nor CoD which probably to many looks visually stunning.  If you want quality in a game then Counter-Strike is one of the best games to play and get, hence why I am recommending this game.
137	1	a	Awesome oldschool game ;)
139	1	a	Play this game to understand why we say this game is the best FPS of one in the world.  Counter-Strike is release over 10 years. but a lot of player still play this game. (including me).  Why? Because is so easy, fun, and memory. I am play Counter-Strike started in 2002 to now. is over 10 years.  Is like Half - Life . This game is revolution in FPS.
141	1	a	  Get outta there, It's gonna blow!
143	1	a	The best competitive first person shooter ever created.
145	1	a	pleying it after school itz very funny
147	1	a	Still the best of counter-strike! :) keep it alive
149	1	a	it was one the best fps games back in a days.. would go back in time when this game was still popular   10/10
151	1	a	A game that is so much fun and nostalgic.  Brings back so many memories.   Always in my heart. &lt;3  10 / 10 - Still fun nowadays.
153	1	a	It's a very good game &lt;3 ^^
155	1	a	This was the first game I ever played, and the game which made me love gaming.   Bless you, 1.6

159	1	a	This game was so fun before css and csgo
161	1	a	Classic which started the legendary CS franchise.
163	1	a	This game is one of best games for me. I recommend this game to all, but i recommend buying Counter Strike: Conditon Zero and completing the game on hardest difficulty two times. Then play Counter Strike. This is one of old generation games so I wanted to buy This game is one of best games for me. I recommend this game to all, but firstly buy Counter Strike: Conditon Zero and complete game on hardest difficul two times. Then play Counter Strike. This is one of the older games so I wanted to buy it first because i wanted see what it was like before. I played that game, my older brothers played aswell . So when you play this game you have the feeling that you went back in time and played it. Gameplay has been perfect for years. The grapichs are still awsome to me, I play a lot of Black Ops 3 on ps4, this is way better than that for me. So if you have pasion and love to games first play Counter Strike , trust me you will had a lot of fun.  I rate the game10/10.
165	1	a	Old but gold!
167	1	a	Counter-Strike 1.6 ruined many hours of my life!
169	1	a	GREATEST GAME OF ALL TIME!
171	1	a	Buy Condition Zero instead if you want to play with bots. And Global offensive if you want to play multiplayer. But wait, I'm not done yet. Your PC/laptop can't handle CS:GO or CS source but still wants to play Multiplayer? Then this legendary FPS game is the right place to do it.
173	1	a	Classic masterpiece full of minimalistic concept of 'shooting bad guys'. 7/10
175	1	a	=100,000 hours
177	1	a	10/10
179	1	a	Great game. A must have for any Steam user.
181	1	a	The best
183	1	a	1.6 is love, 1.6 is life
185	1	a	Counter-Strike is a pretty old game of 'shooter', which was developed in 1999, and since 2000, supported by Valve. This game immediately caught on millions of players around the world. The game is a confrontation of terrorists and counter-terrorists, representing the forces of good and evil. Objectives of the opposing sides differ depending on the map, in which the battle.  And here is my thoughs..  This is the most entertaining video game i've ever played since 2007. I think i've played this game like 2000hrs i guess, played only the cracked version in that day... I finally i bought this game and it's worth 10 bucks indeed. I still play CS 1.6 because i had an amazing childhood with it! By that i didn't mean online or with bots but i had lots of LAN-party's in my country and my friends still play it though but theres still Lan-party's sometimes in my country ^^ The game is still fun and it never gets boring! I mean todally this game has lots of gamemodes which is ZM/ZE/CSDM/GUNGAME/FURIEN/SURF/DEATHRUN/BASEBUILDER and more and more and more... It's just fantastic! :D  10/10 Would recommand it!
187	1	a	This game an immortal :D
189	1	a	Still the best CS ever made!
191	1	a	Thanks for a great childhood
193	1	a	It's an verry competitive game with a lots of acction and a lots of mods. The old school shooter.
195	1	a	Classic of Counter-Strike. The best game for more than 10 years. If you've never experienced it, just get it.  100% recommend.
197	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing nostalgic m8. Best sound N/A. Best Graphix N/A. Nothing better than good ol' 1.6.   And I am an Ex. Team 3D player.
199	1	a	-Love to shoot people with real life guns with different names? -Have you ever dreamed to kill terrorists and even be a terrorist? -Love playing the same, universal map over and over just because it's the only map you'll ever know? (*cough* dust2) -Have you a desire to work as a team to complete objectives? -Do you know how to speak Brazilian-Portuguese and Romanian? (Awesome because many servers have players that have Brazilians, Romanians, and many other South American/Eurpoean players) -Love nostalgia? -Love to have fun? -Love getting an extra game with bots in it for free?  -Love randomly dying from wallbangs?  Great, you've come to the right game. Seriously though, despite the somewhat smaller North American community (Which is still big for the old game it is) it's probably one of the greatest games i've ever come to play, and i've only had it for about a year, and i'm gonna add hundreds of thousands of hours playing this. I don't even have actual friends that play with me yet I can still have fun with this game. From the countless recoil patterns to remember from all the guns, to the extremely friendly community (for the most part) and playing all these classic maps. Yes, of course there's hackers, you'll see a few of them, but they don't ruin the game. Either the server's admin can just ban them or you can just go to a different server, it's not gamebreaking or anything. And besides, if you get this you also get Counter-Strike: Condition Zero, which has bots. Hell, you can even download Zbots for 1.6, and it waypoints for you! Definitely get this game. This game stands the test of time.  10/10 Would throw brick-looking grenades at terrorists again.
201	1	a	If you can't get Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, this is great replacement for it. It's not as popular, but it still has a big amount of players. Some servers may be in languages you can't understand, but the game is still very fun and requires a great amount of skill. One of the best first person shooters, that still holds to this day from 1999. Although the game's graphics...aren't really the best. Even then, you can get skins, map textures, etc. to spice the graphics up a little bit. Though to me, graphics don't really matter. Highly recommend this game. 9.5/10
203	1	a	I've been playing this game for 10 years (7 or 8 years on non-steam), and it still amazes me with the fact that people are still playing this game.   Met bunch of amazing people, learned english more than what school has taught me, joined and left great community every now and then; this game has a huge impact on my life, from personality to the way I see the world (not exaggerating).  Some people claimed they have slept with my family, some claimed they are not a hacker (while their crosshair moves furiously, claiming it was an earthquake), some other claimed they can play better if their ping was lower and some other claimed they have tracked my IP and are on the way to kill me. What a super friendly community.  Best multiplayer fps game in the history of mankind, never gets me bored with tons of user-made mod, and one thing that this game never cease to amaze me is the fact that this game has a better hitbox than CS:GO (come at me CS:GO plebs)  1.6/Counter-Strike, would get rekt by a player playing in the earthquake again
205	1	a	Counter-Strike is a first-person shooter video game developed by Valve Corporation. It was initially developed and released as a Half-Life modification by Minh 'Gooseman' Le and Jess 'Cliffe' Cliffe in 1999, before Le and Cliffe were hired and the game's intellectual property acquired. Counter-Strike was first released by Valve on the Microsoft Windows platform in 2000. The game later spawned a franchise, and is the first installment in the Counter-Strike series. Several remakes and Ports of Counter-Strike have been released on the Xbox console, as well as OS X and Linux.   Set in various locations around the globe, players assume the roles of members of combating teams that include counter-terrorists and terrorists. During each round of gameplay, the two teams are tasked with defeating the other by the means of either achieving the map's objectives, or else killing all of the enemy combatants. Each player may customize their arsenal of weapons and accessories at the beginning of every match, with currency being earned after the end of each round.
207	1	a	legend in FPS game. legend is still alive. This is CS 1.6 !!!
209	1	a	Very good game, the best counter srike so far. 
211	1	a	I don't care what anyone else says, but CS 1.6 is the #1 FPS and it will never die. :)
213	1	a	Played since 1999
215	1	a	CS is fast paced, intense. this game will not disappoint. The 'just one more round' addiction factor is very high. I've been addicted since 2007. I don't have a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing vision for what i am saying. I'm making this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ up as I go. Buy it, download it, whatever; just get on board and if you enjoy it you will NEED it!  Counter-Strike 4 life.
217	1	a	Once bought, your f*cked. 10/10
219	1	a	the best game for RPG and it was very old and till now it is the most epic game :D
221	1	a	.
223	1	a	The greatest game ever made, with Half Life in second. The father to competitive shooters. I'm happy to be back playing it
225	1	a	Ruined my life
227	1	a	Addictive Multiplayer game for me from Years. Till date the only Game i Like to play Online with friends. Love it!
229	1	a	Great Game :))
231	1	a	Play this game. ItÂ´s awesome.
233	1	a	im not 12 u idiot im 13. my dad works for valve and if u win im calling hacks and texting him on my nokia to tell him to ban your computer from the internet you noob. my mom owns microsoft so ill break ur windows noob.  if u use mac u need to die.  this game is ok
235	1	a	The best FPS game in history !
237	1	a	So i buy this game to become good at counter strike but i don't good because 1.6 is hard so i buy source to become good at counter strike but source is hard so i buy global offensive to become good at counter strike but i become silver 1 and realise game is not hard... life is hard and friend once told me to kys (kappa your soul) and i think it is great idea! Any way if you good at counter strike game it is fun if not deinstall game because if you're bad at game you are bad. Overall great game but also bad. Yes thank for read!  Btw Paradise Hillz is ugly â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Thank for read!
239	1	a	Best Esport game of 21th century .   Good :   -easy to play -no cheaters ( maybe 10% if you play on random pubs) , in CSGO 60% cheating. -best game for tournaments as 5x5 -not boring , you can play again and again to improve ur skill  Bad :  VALVE did not support number one online action/esport game before die  was a lot of bugs   9.7/10  Recommend!
241	1	a	nice game...very nice
243	1	a	Excellent, superb, babelicious game. Ruined my last year of Jr. High and a few of my High school years, would ruin again 10/10.  Excelente juego. Arruino unos aÃ±os de escuela, arruinaria de nuevo 10/10.  PS  I miss my WON ID.
245	1	a	For me it is one of the best games on steam community :)
247	1	a	10/10
249	1	a	What a greade game had real good times whit this
251	1	a	Yeah... the old Counter-Strike.... Everybody know, what CS is.. Counter-Strike - My rating - 9/10   Why or Why not to play this old classic ?  Positive:  ItÂ´s a legendary game, and if u playing games like CS:GO etc. u will like it, cause it will be legendary in your library. Almost everybody played CS 1.6 'from start his cs:go career' Counter-Strike 1.6 is latest and best version on the game, and if u purchase CS, u can play it, if u will download it, thereÂ´s is some chance, that u cant play it (Win 8 etc).  Most of legens/proÂ´s in CS:GO played CS 1.6, itÂ´s like beginning, and it could be your beginning!   Negative: No more good tournaments on CS 1.6 (On CS:GO are tournaments like EMS, Dreamhack etc.) Graphic+Gameplay - Graphic sucks... but its still better then WarZ:P Gameplay.... yeah, crouching sucks, aiming sucks... u know... bad gameplay, if u see CS:GO, when is all so smooth, u will hate CS 1.6... but if u play CS 1.6 before then CS:GO, its good for you, and u will like it (probably:D)  So... my opinion is: ItÂ´s legendary game, everyone, who likes FPS must have this in his/her:P steam library. :)   
253	1	a	Best Fps game ever
255	1	a	Greatest game ever.
257	1	a	The best game ever
259	1	a	Flashbang my face
261	1	a	Best game in the world! :-)
263	1	a	The best of all.
265	1	a	This game is the Game of the Millenium...It's the only game that is played from 2000 to today. Every PC is capable to play this game, even the one that didn't got their driver updated on 2003(Probably). So yeah, if you are a fan of old-school, this game is for ya'.
267	1	a	...
269	1	a	Nice Game TO play !!

285	1	a	The best Action Game Ever
287	1	a	I enjoyed so much playing this game :)
289	1	a	Its old game Bat steal playing all world.. :)
291	1	a	(I've deleted all the comments on this because I wanted to give a serious review about this game and delete my older one, so here ya go)  This is the older Counter-Strike as most people know it. Some people usually don't find enjoyment in playing it due to it being either 'out-dated' or 'glitchy'. I personally tend to enjoy this game from time to time because it's an original game made from the first Source engine, and old school shooters in general ain't too shabby either. Due to the game having a small amount of space to fill in your computer, it rarely ever lags, which makes sure of no interruptions to your enjoyment. It's also just as Competitive as the present Counter-Strike games, though there isn't any seperate Comp gamemode, unfortunately. But that's something that Valve decided to save for later purposes I suppose. Still the King of FPS Games (IMO), I would definetely recommend playing this if you enjoy tactical teamwork in your Online Gaming.
293	1	a	Old school! Played this game from the VERY beginning and I still play it. Not as good as I used to be, but I can still hold my ground for an old guy! :D Recommend all players that like FPS games to get this and play it. Still lots of servers out there and still lots of players.
295	1	a	Recommend delete Counter-Strike:Source &amp; CS:GO !
297	1	a	Its an Awesome game... wud spend ma whole lyf playing dis game :)
299	1	a	No skins no updates good recoil control good servers less russians better servers old style :) I love it .
301	1	a	One of the best games ever out there. Yes, it is old but it is JUST amazing. Much better than CoD; and just as good as Battlefied 3 or 4 maybe :P. There are many things tod if you get bored of the tactical playing in games. You can bhop, deathrun, surf and a lot of other things. This honestly should be a $60 game for how good it actually is. So just get this game as it is simply amazing!
303	1	a	No skins no updates good recoil control good servers less russians better servers old style :) I love it .
305	1	a	A masterpiece you won't ever forget!
307	1	a	10/10

311	1	a	cs the best
313	1	a	Old but gold! :)
315	1	a	CS1.6 indeed the best multiplayer game in the FPS world. I have literally grown up playing this game and still have not got bored having played it for over 10 years now.
317	1	a	The Best Game
319	1	a	Great FPS game, recommended! 
321	1	a	It is a good Co-op game for online gamers.
323	1	a	I've been playing this game since 2004, this game is mind blowing awesome. If you're not looking deeply into graphics, but just want to have fun playing, then this game is for you. Multiple gamemodes, will keep anyone amused. If you don't have it, then what are you waiting for? Get it now!
325	1	a	The Best Game !
327	1	a	(RADIO): Fire in the hole! You got flashed and got stuck in the corner by a teammate (RADIO): Fire in the hole!,(RADIO): Fire in the hole!,(RADIO): Fire in the hole! And both die from a grenade gg nice game will rush again with him
329	1	a	Death is a great teacher. Failure in Counter-Strike is, as it always has been for this series, the greatest way to learn where you should have gone, what you shouldn't have done, and how you could have done better. Counter-Strike players spend a lot of time learning -- consequently, they are always getting better.
331	1	a	Played this game for the first time in 2008. Since then I have clocked more than 5000 hours, that's how addictive its multiplayer is. Father of all FPS in MP. Plus has several mods deathmatch, hns, kz, gungame, scrim, zombiemod and paintball. It's been 14 years and the game is still going strong atleast in the Indian scene.
333	1	a	the wallbangs are real 10/10
335	1	a	it`s ok.:)(2k14) Edit:It`s ok?!That`s all i had to say then? Kinda unfair, given that this is the game of my childhood. Was i a normal grill who loved to spend her whole day with friends back then when it was still OK and actually encouraged to play outside? YUP. But was i also a little geek who couldn`t wait to get back home from school and viciously murder anyone in my path of winning the match?Hells to the yeaah. Note: Can you believe i`m in Medical school, after all of that?  Rainy day cs-playing is the best thing in the world, hands down. This game never gets old.If you haven`t played cs, you`ve lived for nothing. Peace!^^
337	1	a	One of the first games I played, brings back so much memories.  And its â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing fun.
339	1	a	2nd Best game from VALVe games after Half-Life 1, even with new VALVe games but this one is still amazing, played it for ages and still!
341	1	a	Thanks valve for â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing up the game. still awesome though.
343	1	a	:)
345	1	a	Great for older Counter Strike players and newer ones to experience what older players had with this game :)
347	1	a	I still remember this from my childhood, It was the first FPS game that I ever played on a computer.
349	1	a	Counter Strike 1.6 Helping People Expand their Russian Vocabulary Since 2000

357	1	a	..:)
359	1	a	Best Game ever Old Its Gold :)
361	1	a	Loved it &lt;3
363	1	a	This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:  I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over and he didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I don't remember a day when I was so happy like back then. So, the journey started. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a whole experience. Playing public servers and maybe some servers with mods was very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.   I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO, but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games.
365	1	a	The god of classic fps.
367	1	a	A game you can play forever:)
369	1	a	Game will be played forever
371	1	a	hi,  thanks for the cs

411	1	a	Using an AWP is cheaper than â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing my mother and no one wants to see either. Go play CoD.
413	1	a	10/10
415	1	a	Old but Gold :)
417	1	a	Counter-Strike 1.6 is one of my best games I've ever played even if I played alot of games, The graphics doesn't matter but the gameplay is the important :)!
419	1	a	Classic FPS.
421	1	a	I haven't written a review in a while but I'd like to do one for this game. Before CS:GO came out I played this game every now and then after school but I normally played Source. I started playing this game after I remember the difficulty and skill needed to handle the aiming in this game and honestly after all these years this game is still amazing, if you get the 'These graphics are â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥' mindset and focus on the gameplay it's amazing. It's fast-paced and some of the modded maps are insanely detailed. Amazing game with amazing replay value.
423	1	a	Mind blowing graphics, better than 2034 source 3 engine physics too.
425	1	a	The best of its time.
427	1	a	Top old times game. So... what are you waiting for? just buy it damm
429	1	a	Best classic game that I've been playing for years, if it wasnt for CAL falling apart, the release of other verisons of counter-strike such as condition zero, source, and global offense. I would still be playing competitivly
431	1	a	Best game 4ever, no game is gonna beat this
433	1	a	Mother of First-Person-Shooter games! This 14 years old game is still in the top 10 most played games, was and will always be the world's number 1 online action game. Once you play this game, you will never get bored of it, even if you were unskilled in classic mods, there will always be a good and funny mod that will suits you. Still haven't bought this game? Go get it! Fully recommended - 10/10!
435	1	a	:)
437	1	a	It is a very good, classic game, which started the multiplayer shooter game series of Counter Strike.
439	1	a	buy counter-strike 1,6
441	1	a	Counter Strike 1.6 is a box with million unforgivable memories of mine inside. Great coop which you will never get bored by. Most liked deathmatch and zombie mode.
443	1	a	Old game...But GOLD game!
445	1	a	:))
447	1	a	Classic is always Best &lt;3
449	1	a	6/5
451	1	a	In my opinion, it's probably the best counter strike game out there and yes, better than cs go. ;)
453	1	a	HeatoNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
455	1	a	Omg, This Game is 1st best games in 2009-2011. &lt;3 i will never stop playing,  NEVER    
457	1	a	One of the best game i've ever played in my whole life! This game was the best ,this game is the best ,this game will be the best.
459	1	a	Good old game, but time is up!
461	1	a	  Old but Gold
463	1	a	Game which dragged me in gaming, as outdated and old it is, the best memories for me lies within this game. I mainly played because of mods, which were great, like Zombie Mod, Death Run and WC3FT Mod
465	1	a	Game gives me 20-30 fps :D But the memories :)
467	1	a	9/11
469	1	a	Not long before this game becomes yet another timeless tale of gaming's glorious past, and far from dead is that past.   Newcomers to PC Gaming: Point is, it's a classic, and mandatory if you own a PC. So in short, straighten the hell up, ignore your idiot friends nagging you for a game of League or DOTA or BF4 or Planetside or whatever other garbage you've convinced yourself is good, and start from the ground up when you build your collection.
471	1	a	Seriously im playing this game because of kreedz mod and climbing other than that is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ but still cool tho
473	1	a	Can shoot terrorists and be terrorist. Can plant bomb as terrorist.  Counter-Strike predicting ISIS before it even existed confirmed? More updates as they come.   UPDATE: Valve has replied to my message, and only said 'Never email us again or we will ban your Steam account'. Yes. So I wondered, what if I ran this through my decoder machine? So I ran it through my decoder machine. And it came out as this lonely message: Trump did 7/11.  What could it mean? I'm not really sure. I'll keep you guys posted.   UPDATE #2: I've done extensive research, and it appears that this decoded message either means that Donald J. Trump owns a large chain of convenience stores, or that he is an international terrorist threat. At this point I'm not entirely sure which it is. If you have insight into this topic, please reach me at  xXilluminartyboizXx@internetexplorer.com . Thanks.   UPDATE #3: This might be my final update. I found a note slipped into my underwear when I woke up this morning. It was adressed from Valve. I opened it, naturally. Inside was one, simple sentence: Trump sees all.   Guys, listen, I don't know for sure if Trump did 7/11, or he made ISIS, or anything, but it's been fun trying to figure it out. If I don't make it to another update, and they get to me first, just tell my hamster Poochins that I loved him. Peace out.
475	1	a	Cool

489	1	a	one of the best fps game!
491	1	a	THIS GAME IS AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!
493	1	a	Counter-Strike is the best first-person online shooting game. Because it depends only in your own skills. There are no advantages like in Call of Duty series, you will need to aim correctly, know the recoil of your gun and shoot your enemies to death.
495	1	a	(-:
497	1	a	The classic. If you haven't played it yet give it a go (oh the pun) and don't let the lack of ShineyGrafixâ„¢ disappoint you. I have both the later Source and currently latest GO versions but still come back to the original version from time to time because it is still fun and its classic style is still completely fine... and a lot of people who still play CS regularly shares my view.
499	1	a	I like this game very much and.. LOVE IT .. :D In this game i liked strategy, team work and competitions, in specially i like to play with people, with friends:)
501	1	a	despite it's graphic this game is one of the best fps first shooter games , u will enjoy it with a low recoil and a smooth game that nearly require no money.
503	1	a	I don't have to talk much about this game... It's so perfect! I know people who have got about 4000 hours on this game :o and they are not bored yet:)

543	1	a	Very Good Game &lt;3
545	1	a	The classic action FPS: Counter-Strike, has made a huge impact on my gaming life, ever since I was a pre-pubscent,6 year old child. Enjoying various betas and versions throughout it's development, the game has evolved from a mod for Half-Life, to one of the most viewed and played eSports.   If you haven't already, buy it,play it and enjoy it. I have nailed countless of hours on different accounts I've had, and of course the non-steam versions  10/10
547	1	a	u don't have NoSpread lel, this game only for Legit.

569	1	a	Play the world's number 1 online action game. Engage in an incredibly realistic brand of terrorist warfare in this wildly popular team-based game. Ally with teammates to complete strategic missions. Take out enemy sites. Rescue hostages. Your role affects your team's success. Your team's success affects your role.

575	1	a	Still the best shooter out there. Nothing can beat 1.6. Get some mates, play on a well configured server and enjoy this masterpiece.
577	1	a	Here's my story, I went over to my friend's house one day, he was playing CS. I tried it for myself, I was instantly hooked and have been for over 10 years with the counter strike franchise. Best online action franchise ever for the pc in my opinion. Counter strike is like a drug that you will never be cured from, trust me.

691	1	a	Wanted a physical copy of this game , rather than purchasing it online, to leave my children a memoir of one of the gr8test games in history, but anyway... this will do the trick more or less. +1 , the only game i really knew how to play and i really enjoyed playing.
693	1	a	:)
695	1	a	Very nice old school game.
697	1	a	#1 !

709	1	a	This game... Lots of memories. Lot of spent time playing this game in childhood, still having nostalgic feelings. I still play this game sometimes and it still makes me happy. c:
711	1	a	Really good game.. Its old but it is still good and funny.. Mostly i enjoy playing modes like Jailbreak/furien mode. I recomend this game.
713	1	a	The game is very beatiful and full of emotions while playing online. All the gamers, harcore gamers, have to play it. It is just about skills and trainings.
715	1	a	One of the best fps games out there, tho' the graphics arent as good as the current gen games but this is a worth to try game. Playing this game for like 4 years or so absolutely incredible game period.. :)
717	1	a	A great game!!!
719	1	a	:) 
721	1	a	Seriously the bestest game ever :D
723	1	a	Play it if you like mexicans who can't afford a computer to play csgo
725	1	a	;)
727	1	a	Du â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥!
729	1	a	awsome game world's number 1 game awsome
731	1	a	This is my all time favourite game. It is one of the first game I played. This game has been with me until now and I am still playing it with a big joy. It may be old but there is no other game that can replace it in my life.
733	1	a	Easy to learn. Hard to master.
735	1	a	This Game Is a classic master piece. And has AMAZING replay value. As a young gamer my self growing up in a world where most casual gamers are xbox humping, cod playing, graphic â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s. It is shameful that this game is not played. This game made and broke friendships and made a childhood for many people. Even if you dont play the game often. Please just get it for it to be in your library. 8/10 for some bugs and a now strange community. But nonetheless a great game.
737	1	a	so old, but gold.
739	1	a	Call of Dutyâ„¢ ripoff
741	1	a	This game changed gaming as a whole. One of the best FPS of all time, if not the best. But its all about the gameplay. Its how CS plays that will get you. Huge online community, thousands of mods, nostalgic graphics, excellent gameplay, nice sound effects even if they r outdated. CS 1.6 is my favorite FPS and is much better than Global Offensive in all aspects. I played this game so much before i got Steam, this game is just spetacular. Even in non-steam gaming, lan houses,competitive play, CS 1.6 is still incredibly popular. 10/10, congratulations to the developers.
743	1	a	So, fall asleep love, loved by me... for I know love, I am loved by thee. Read more at  http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes_of_the_day.html#zvQY7U3Ax27DSMXQ.99 
745	1	a	Great game. I have no words. The controls, graphics, and the gameplay are really good, especially for the time. It's fun, there is a lot you can do too. Would definitely recommend this game.
747	1	a	The chat was overfilled with people blaming for hacks.  I like it that way.
749	1	a	The Best FPS :D
751	1	a	Yes Counter-Strike ! The Best FPS Game Ever !  I always Play on this game it's super cool !
753	1	a	This game is perfect and awesome!!!
755	1	a	Classic game. Love it &lt;3
757	1	a	While starting to show its age, Counter-Strike is a classic that you just have to play!
759	1	a	A briliant FPS game. Fast Paced Action. Skill Required = Good FPS
761	1	a	This is the game that started a genre, every shooter since CS has copied its competitive team-based style of play. Its the original to a legacy, and many people still play it to this day. It has older graphics for people who might not have an expensive computer, plenty of dedicated servers, and the core gameplay that is known worldwide is right here where it belongs.  But obviously you know this already unless you've been spending your life playing on Xbox and playstation. Right?
763	1	a	A Very good game indeed..... proves that graphics dont matter, gameplay does
765	1	a	1 Word 'Classic' :D
767	1	a	BUUUM ! Head shot!
769	1	a	The best game I played
771	1	a	Good game no scamms like in tf2
773	1	a	The most addictive thing , EVER!
775	1	a	We will never forget about 1.6 , at its time this game was not only a game , it was a sport , a purpose , a way of living , i've been playing this since the beginning(back in 1999 or 2000 can't remember for sure :D) and i don't know what the world of gaming would have been today without it , so Counter Strike will always remain the king :D
777	1	a	FOREVER THE BEST!
779	1	a	=)
781	1	a	brb gonna learn russian
783	1	a	Obviously good.
785	1	a	My favorite game til now, just ruined my life 5/5 ~
787	1	a	this is an awesome game old but gold &lt;3
789	1	a	Very cooool game :)!!!! I Llike This GAME :d
791	1	a	So many years with us, but still the best game ever. :)
793	1	a	One of the best games I played and playing till now ^_^
795	1	a	Still the best FPS. Even after playing CS GO, 1.6 will always have a place in my heart.
797	1	a	The greatest multiplayer shooter experience I've had since Quake 1. The e-sport scene also helped it alot, it's the only computer game I've really followed when it comes to e-sports (back when I followed the CPL etc). The design of the game was simple but very effective and delivered a multiplayer experience that few other games can match. The Call of Duty and Battlefield titles, although good in their own right, never drew me in like Counter-Strike.
799	1	a	csik is for real mans
801	1	a	This game will always have a place in my heart,I grew up with this one.It also doesn't require a good PC,you don't need to worry about ranks too,simple as that and don't be put off by the graphics...By the way you can still find surf/bhop servers so it's worth it!
803	1	a	hmm. trying to earn a few batches.
805	1	a	Old but gold !
807	1	a	Nice game, i recommend it!
809	1	a	Old school game.
811	1	a	why the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ not?
813	1	a	After 16 years of existence, this legendary game is still in the Steam top 10 most played multiplayer games in the world. it's one of the best shouter games ever made !! you can't get bored of this one, trust me i have about 1.3k hours here on steam &amp; more than 2k on the non steam version =) but ppl left it to play 'modern games' like cs go &amp; battlefield &amp; COD .. what a shame !! there still some alive communities &amp; servers so don't be afraid ... but the sad thing is that there are many cheaters (you will get used to see them anyways, thank god there are many admins who can take care of them) i love this game so much but after all maybe this it's the right time to let it go. maybe one day i will comeback to find it alive again like the old days, maybe one day :) anyways, i totally recommend this game for everyone! don't be shy go buy it now if you didn't already do !' this is a must have one !'
815	1	a	10/10 Would review again.
817	1	a	Playing with people within this game made me a bad person.  Playing with people within this game made me reetarded.  Playing with people within this game has formed a tumor inside my brain.  Playing this game will make you a homosexual.  And you will like it.
819	1	a	Awesome game! Never had so much fun with any other game!
821	1	a	Nice game :D
823	1	a	Get in position and wait for my go !
825	1	a	This is not a game. This is a life.  I'm so sorry that there are too much cheaters on servers, but if Valve can make it better , it would be great :D Remember old good times, waiting to start a new match between Na'Vi and fNatic &lt;3 And all other teams... Then somebody made a cheat, and destroyed a game. This game changed many lives, many people. I think this game become the world best game ever. For me, it's the best game. I play it every day, but it isn't like sometimes. Now graphic is important. Well, it isn't. I know that this game is dead already... I want to get it back, but there is no way to do that.  Cheaters are everywhere now. In every single game. You can buy cheat for CS:GO for 5$ I think... My friend bought it. I asked him : ' Why did you bought that ? Isn't it better to enjoy playing the game without cheats? ' He told me: ' I want to beat everyone. I want to be the best. No one can stop me now. '  I don't know why are you doing it, this is beautiful game. When I played it for the first time, it was awesome :D Finally a game that I can play with my friends on LAN. And, till today, I'm playing it. I never downloaded a cheat. I don't need that. I want to learn how to play, to be the beast in the world... Now everyone is wanting money, money money... I heard about CS:GO Lounge aka CS GO betting site. Now everyone is watching matches because of skins, to get free money... Well, when I was young, in 2005. I waited with my friends a CS 1.6 match. It was beautiful. Now i sit here, and watch this CS:GO matches... So many people watch matches... But 90% watch them because of f***ing bet...  It will never be like sometimes... Or we can change everything...  Valve please, get this game back to life &lt;3  Thanks.
827	1	a	Great
829	1	a	I always love returning to this classic game. Only love for this one &lt;3
831	1	a	Counter-Strike is the best game ever!

851	1	a	Old but Gold . ^^
853	1	a	Old School Rules B-)
855	1	a	Old but Gold . ^^
857	1	a	This is an excellent and classic game, every FPS player should play this game.
859	1	a	Counter-Strike - a series of computer games in the genre of team first-person shooter based on the engine GoldSource, originally appeared as a modification of Half-Life games.  You have to compare, so this game I will compare with Ð¡S: Source and CS: Global Offensive    Pros:    1. Battle PVP.   The multiplayer game is fully revealed the potential of the idea of the game. The most interesting part of this is. Under the bot can already tune in, but not in the real players. They can deceive, to negotiate, to use cunning tactics to create unusual ambushes.   2. The atmosphere and realism.   In all games, Valve is always a great atmosphere and I was impressed. It is evident that the developers have tried to do everything in this game, as in real life. For example, the sounds. Unfortunately, Valve released a patch in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive with new sounds and they made a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.       Minuses:    1. Cheaters.   Well, as without these â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s? These sons of dogs prevent us from playing. Creators of cheats have always been one step ahead of the creators of the VAC anti-cheat. Valve is trying to improve its anti-cheat and have it turns out.I say that Valve do nothing, not worth it.   2.Graphic arts.   She was good at Counter-Strike as long as did not come out Source. I'm not picky about graphics, but after 30 minutes I start to hurt your eyes. Yes, and in general, this game proved to all that the graphics in games are not the most important thing.   3.Termination of support.   All good things always come to an end, and Counter-Strike is not an exception. The game goes more and more players, server empty.More Valve does not release an update for Counter-Strike and does not support it in e-sports.     Conclusion:     Despite the fact that in this game there are downsides, even if they have, but still this game is legendary.  If you ask me, as you Counter-Strike, the fond memories flooding back me, maybe I can cry .Game, which was able to give me a lot of positive emotions..  
861	1	a	After years, it`s still very fun to play with friends.
863	1	a	Best FPS game I've ever played . 'Rise above all'
865	1	a	The best FPS game to ever touch the PC industry, up to this day, no one has been able to properly replicate it, that is all.
867	1	a	I like this classic game! All textures,all weapons....I think this game was the first, and I hope to be still, the best!
869	1	a	The best porn game ;)
871	1	a	Nice Game LOL
873	1	a	Should be free . Still one of the best games!

883	1	a	Best FPS game of all time. It's a shame only a few people still play it.
885	1	a	Counter Strike Is Best Game In The World:*
887	1	a	.
889	1	a	  Old but good game!
891	1	a	Most favourite game of my childhood &lt;3
893	1	a	Old But Gold
895	1	a	The game of my childhood.
897	1	a	This is my favorite game .
899	1	a	This is real good game!!!!!!
901	1	a	Counter-Strike was one of the first video games I have ever played and will always be up there in my list of favorite games.  I had just installed it. It was my first multiplayer game and I though I'm too new to play against players so I played only with bots slowly progressing from easy to to the hard ones. Then one day I joined a Dust II DM server. It was chaotic, but fun. I didn't even know the map then, but I learned it by playing lots of DM. I slowly climbed the integrated server ranks and made friends with one of the admins...then after a while the server disappeared.  After that I found out about deathrun. I was horrible at it, but the regulars helped me and I started visiting the server more and more. Apparently the same server chain had a gun game server too. Now that was amazing. Completely different people played there, but again friendly ones. After a couple of months the server chain was shut down...  I continued playing aim, awp, jailbreak and other mods. I didn't even play the classic mode, it wasn't of that big interest to me, though after a couple of months I stopped playing CS.  I can't not recommend this game, because I have so many memories from it. Nostalgia.
903	1	a	This game sucks.
905	1	a	It's cs1.6 and your on Steam, if you don't have this then please follow these steps:  1. Uninstall Steam. 2. Kill yourself.
907	1	a	+++
909	1	a	.
911	1	a	THe best online multiplayer game ever
913	1	a	Ruined My LIFE :P 
915	1	a	Happy Birtday 17 Years....Old but Gold
917	1	a	Cool and classic.who love this oldschool game.you can try!
919	1	a	Old, but gold! 9.5/10
921	1	a	No matter what they do to newer versions of the game, this will be the best one.
923	1	a	What is there to say, this game started the insane multiplayer fps mania. If you are interested in custom modes (zombie mode, deathrun, bunnyhop) or just want to check out the roots of this amazing series of games, you ought to give this one a shot, but if all you care about is dust2 24/7, you should get CS:Source or Case Opening Sim.   9/10
925	1	a	nice game old school
927	1	a	IT IS A GAME FOR PROS JOIN IT AND BE A PRO
929	1	a	steampowered urpok pachemu name etot?
931	1	a	The best
933	1	a	it's ok
935	1	a	Been playing CS since 2003. Despite what the box on tactical ops says no really it's not better than counter strike. CS is the best first person shooter in my opinion. The reason 1.6 is better than GO or Source is because it's about player skill not graphics. The hit boxes are much better. In order to be a great player you need to know how to execute movement even bunny hop.   Best game ever.
937	1	a	very much better tha csgo AND YOU KNOW
939	1	a	it's ok
941	1	a	1337
943	1	a	its a perfect game for learning precision in shooting games! i recommend it :P

947	1	a	The classic game that everybody relates to :Fun,Skill,Good Memories ......And HAX !!!!! 
949	1	a	Old but gold. :)
951	1	a	I don't think the original Counter-Strike needs an actual review, so I would just be giving it a recommendation. Consider this review a mere recommendation.
953	1	a	condition zero is better from its community which is mostly 40 year olds, this is full of sqeakers so its kinda cancer you know? haha.
955	1	a	The time that your head was the size of a pillow :D

971	1	a	Hello there i need help. I got a cs complete gift which i used on my account which was already having a cs 1.6 copy but after i used my gift (in my library) my 1 cs 1.6 copy is gone kindly help
973	1	a	Classic Shooter, good
975	1	a	THIS IS MADNESS!
977	1	a	Nice GAme
979	1	a	-This is my opinion your experience may vary-  counter strike a name that almost anyone will recognize. Before I played counter strike I knew that it was a game loved by thousands even millions and that people play it every day.  =The Graphics=  this game's graphics are good (IMO) and it may not look to good by todays standards, they hold up just fine.  =The Gameplay=  The gameplay in Counter Strike involves starting out with some money to buy equipment, you earn more mony by killing members on the opposing team rescuing hostages, deactivating bombs, or plant and explode the bomb, also 1 life per round so work together.  =My Verdict=  I love this game the people who play it are pretty cool most of the time and the game can really suck you in and $10 may be kinda steep in for a game this old but it comes with  -Counter Strike -Counter Strike: Condition Zero -Counter Strike: Condition Zero Deleted Scenes  wich all come in the $10 asking price and I would give this game a 9/10
981	1	a	:)
983	1	a	This is probably the game that set the foundation for Steam. This game has aged quite well, with its balance of original team based strategy and maps like de_dust 2 are legendary. This is without a doubt one of the greatest computer games of all time!
985	1	a	The best game in the world. ~ 
987	1	a	Best game ever. The joy it gives when playing with friends is unbelievable .

1019	1	a	The best shooting game you will play in your entire life.
1021	1	a	Still the best.
1023	1	a	GUWNO BO NIE DA SIE CELOWAÄ†!!!!!1 A W SNAJPERCE NIE MA CELOWNIKA   ENG ITS CREYP COS U CAN'T ADS!!!!!! AND THERS NO CROSSHAIR ON SNIPR RIFEL!  9/10
1025	1	a	Very nice game

1033	1	a	Nice game
1035	1	a	Omg I Love This Game &lt;3
1037	1	a	The best Game
1039	1	a	Is this the classic game, but the best. 
1041	1	a	All good old Counter-Strike. Still better than beta CS1.0, 1.1 and 1.5 with a few new standards and fixes, but now is a new age with a CS:GO, cuz CS 2.0 we won't see soon enough. :)
1043	1	a	UNDOUBTEDLY MY ALL TYM FAVOURITE...:D
1045	1	a	YES, long live counter strike 1.6 - the best game ever.
1047	1	a	awesome game truly an nyc game with tactics, guns, different maps, etc
1049	1	a	This is my favourite game :)
1051	1	a	:)
1053	1	a	Best of Counter Strike!
1055	1	a	The best competitive multiplayer FPS experience for low end computers. Even an old laptop can run this probably. Bit of a learning curve with weapons. Condition Zero expansion has Half-Life style campaign though not as groundbreaking, but also additional mp maps and a singleplayer bot mode that is goal oriented and challenging.
1057	1	a	Great this game!
1059	1	a	life = 1.6
1061	1	a	most awesome game ever.  i play it since betas in 1999.   keep on rockin'!

1071	1	a	I like the recoil on all the cs 1.6 wapons. Specually on the dgl and the ak. Move this recoil to csgo :)
1073	1	a	this is old school game very popular in the world and I love this game ! Unreal epic battles and mm , good weapon and a lot of fun in this game ! Buy it and live more funny 
1075	1	a	Almost 15 years old, 11th most played Steam game in 2015. Should already tell something.
1077	1	a	The best game ever with the best gameplay.. :))))
1079	1	a	Was the best game ever:)

1105	1	a	Not much to say, really. The pinnacle of first-person shooters, that still manages to live on today. The community is not what it was, let's say, 10 years ago. However, this game still manages to be an enjoyable experience for anyone wanting a good old wholesome first-person shooter experience. Highly recommended, though if you haven't bought it until now, don't buy it, due to the lack of support from players, and the high difficulty of the online play.
1107	1	a	Best Game for ever   This game will never suck  and will never be an outdated game
1109	1	a	Old School enough sayd!
1111	1	a	^^
1113	1	a	Best game of my life..

1117	1	a	Played better than most of russians then get banned from server.  10/10 would rek again more russians
1119	1	a	I still play this because I'm a hipster
1121	1	a	Old But Gold :)
1123	1	a	Great Game =D
1125	1	a	Best.FPS.Ever. You may have noticed I have very little hours, that is because, as a young duck, I used to play this game 24/7 at cybercafes vs randoms who played it, basically a LAN there, brings tears to my eyes the experiences I shared with this game and the people at that 1 cybercafe :_(.
1127	1	a	Cool
1129	1	a	NIce game
1131	1	a	+
1133	1	a	Everything at all !
1135	1	a	Amazing game, I would highly recommend to curious CS:GO players.

1153	1	a	the best game of the world, forever in our heart &lt;3
1155	1	a	The one and only!
1157	1	a	cs 1.6 forever
1159	1	a	Classic.
1161	1	a	Warning this game will prevent you from going outside :c
1163	1	a	The legend of func_vehicle is eternal, all bless Nipper, mapper of ages.
1165	1	a	Started at the very beginning to play counter strike at 1.3 and since then it was my favorite online FPS game. Played it very long and have to say since than it was and still is perfect. Sad but its old, and lost its support. Still coming back to remember everything. But now spending time on CS:GO.. If you have an older machine i recommend it to play, cause there are still many servers, and game mods active!
1167	1	a	Awesome game been playing for years
1169	1	a	you can't go wrong with counter-strike
1171	1	a	It will remain one of the best games in history of CS :) Pitty steam can't track hours from back in the day.
1173	1	a	old school out of time ^_^
1175	1	a	Hard as f***. Got destroyed by 12 year old korean children.  
1177	1	a	Playing the original  (kinda, after the mod-play anyway)  CS game in 2015 has a certain nostalgia factor, bringing back fun  (&amp; sometimes bleh)  memories for those who played and supported it during infancy. 15 years ago, I couldn't have imagined Counter-Strike becoming the competitive FPS-gaming standard that it is today, especially with its latest leap into CS:GO. (Global Offensive, even while taking changes as they come, is the new favorite goose-- Carrying the Law of Newer, Faster, Bolder-- But even there, the core CS spirit &amp; experience is true. And always slowly evolving...)   It's good to look back at how far this franchise has come, as even with each controversial change or update, I know each decision is calculated with the desire to keep moving forward-- While  (hopefully)  staying as true to it's core as possible.   LONG LIVE COUNTER-STRIKE.  &amp; LONG LIVE DIXIE MAFIA. 
1179	1	a	One of the best action games in the world :|
1181	1	a	Nice game...
1183	1	a	Best game of my life
1185	1	a	Winners Train, Losers Complain.
1187	1	a	This is a great game! I'd check out Source now, Im headed over to check out GO right now and see how it compares CS:S is legendary though, so its going to be tough to beat!
1189	1	a	I really like the game, but I couldnâ€™t find the stupid cake.
1191	1	a	nice game I love it :D
1193	1	a	Still Best Game In The World xD Old school &lt;3

1283	1	a	...
1285	1	a	+++++++
1287	1	a	I`ts my first game i`m play with non-steam 500Hours !
1289	1	a	This isnt a bad game. I played this game when i was young and learned playing this game with friends.
1291	1	a	A classic, just a great game in general.
1293	1	a	Counter Strike: Source with carboard walls! Love the feeling when I get wallbanged from the other side of the map! Can be runned on a toaster! Thanks for the great childhood :) 10/10

1303	1	a	No soft,play hard go pro ;)
1305	1	a	â™¥
1307	1	a	the best
1309	1	a	Still one of the best multiplayer games to ever be made. This is still my favourite CS
1311	1	a	.
1313	1	a	Best multiplayer EVER!
1315	1	a	I didn't play much but it looks like a cool game.
1317	1	a	The best game of all time counter strike 1.6 &lt;3
1319	1	a	I think every huge counter strike fan should own this game. This was the beginning of the online fps genre and was a huge point in online history
1321	1	a	Half-Life: Counter-strike has redefined online play. This game has more potential and more online gaming goodness than any other game I've ever played. Finding good servers is always a concern when it comes to online play. As perhaps the most popular multi-player game in town, CS features literally thousands of servers at any one time. You'll almost always find guys to play with. 
1323	1	a	Nice game ^^
1325	1	a	still the best counter-strike together with condition zero, good times :)
1327	1	a	Classic :D
1329	1	a	The first and always the best fps game
1331	1	a	.
1333	1	a	The best game i ever played! Most of my friends are addicted to this game and it's like a drugs,when you start to play,you can't stop :)
1335	1	a	&lt;3 this game made my childhood
1337	1	a	  â™¥
1339	1	a	An old classic but is still fun to play.
1341	1	a	Really Addictive Game With Great Players
1343	1	a	worth playing ;)
1345	1	a	;]]] +
1347	1	a	this game is perfect i suport this , i love this i hope never to die this game :D
1349	1	a	A classic which is still very much alive!
1351	1	a	Counter-Strike has come a long way and to see this game really brings out how much it has come. I feel as this game is not just a time waster but a reason to still be on the Internet. But In 1999, I crawled out of Counter-Strikeâ€™s wretched â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ to become the man I am today. And, now, Iâ€™m tasked with rating the game. How does one even rate his mother?  In sixth grade, I would wake up for school at 5:30 AM, but then I started getting up at 4:30 just to get a couple rounds in before class. Call it dedication or a sickening obsession, but I was hooked on CS (nevermind my neighbor who broke into my house to play while I slept!) It was more than a game. It was my social hub, my iTunes visualizer, and my brief entryway into game design (which didnâ€™t go very far.) It is and remains a standout multiplayer shooter that paved the way for things to come with Call of Duty and Battlefield.  Being eight years since the excellent Source remake, Valve has decided itâ€™s time to give the game another facelift. What started as a Source port for consoles became a more ambitious project that included PC. While there are no radical departures in Global Offensive, it is without a doubt a reboot. Valve has just hit the reset button on the series, once again. As drastic and premature of a maneuver it may be, there is no denying that Counter-Strike remains an addictive and rewarding competitive shooter like no other.  In sixth grade, I would wake up for school at 5:30 AM, but then I started getting up at 4:30 just to get a couple rounds in before class. Call it dedication or a sickening obsession, but I was hooked on CS (nevermind my neighbor who broke into my house to play while I slept!) It was more than a game.

1353	1	a	Greatest cs of all time
1355	1	a	:)
1357	1	a	  I love this game a lot!
1359	1	a	YOU JUST NEED TO KNOW THE MAPS , THATS ALL , GO PLAY JUAN DEAGLE 1.6
1361	1	a	Still the best game :)
1363	1	a	You look at the GUI of CS 1.6 and you think what a lovely eyes they have &lt;3
1365	1	a	  bot bot botï¼
1367	1	a	addictive
1369	1	a	Classic.
1371	1	a	Going 1 time, you won't be able to stop!
1373	1	a	Very good game and loadÂ´s of fun !!
1375	1	a	10/10  Roses are red CTs are blue I cant bhop And that is true
1377	1	a	Day 355:  Everyone still have HLDJ.
1379	1	a	best online game
1381	1	a	the best.
1383	1	a	This game ruined my life but its the best fun i ever had. Would recommend for everyone. 10/10
1385	1	a	the best game ever
1387	1	a	pure white cocaine of fps games
1389	1	a	easy
1391	1	a	Great game for competitive play even today, all skill and no skins. No eye candy or anything like in Counter-Strike: Global Offensensive, but yes Global Offensive is always another great game.
1393	1	a	I went from CS:GO to this after 1K Hours on CS:GO and I still think this game is gorgeous. I'm really sad that I started to play 1.6 just now, and also that I missed the 1.6 golden era. Even if the physics and almost everything else is really different and 'strange' I find it more relaxing to play but at the same time harder then GO. A lot of players don't even know about this game, but people listen me! If you love CS in general you have to play this game at least once and please don't crack it...you'll find only russians on that versions and everybody knows how they play at CS ;)
1395	1	a	I don't think I have enough in-game hours to review this.
1397	1	a	The Best : )
1399	1	a	This Game Is one Of The Best Games On The word
1401	1	a	+++
1403	1	a	This game is awesome! Thanks!

1425	1	a	Best â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing game ever made, nothing like that dogshit game League of Legends. 1.6 has everything, multiplayer, great community and actually good balancing, League can't get any of that â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ so it's left outside with the other â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ games like â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing Starcraft and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing Halo.
1427	1	a	And thus a legend was born..

1531	1	a	&gt;Look for servers &gt;'Hmm this looks nice' &gt;'JAJAJAJAJA DELICIOUSO' &gt;*Awp 8 people in 1 round* &gt;'PUTÃ€ GRINGO, ES UN MARICÃ“N Y USOS WALLERO' &gt;You have been permanently banned from the server  Admins also have the ability to mess with your config and sensitivity for some reason  10/10 would get hacked by a mexican again.
1533	1	a	i wanna add bots how's thaat ? 
1535	1	a	Probably the best game of all time !!!
1537	1	a	where are the skins?
1539	1	a	best game with csgo
1541	1	a	i bought cs but i am dont have counter strike zero why ?
1543	1	a	Best shooter ever!
1545	1	a	very nice game! if you wanna be good cs:go players you must start from this game!
1547	1	a	Best FPS game i've ever played. Highly addictive..
1549	1	a	Counter-strike is an amazing game i have pretty much grown up playing this game it never gets old totally in love with the game , you can pick it up pretty cheap way worth the price for all the hours of fun you can have check it out !
1551	1	a	Even it's like 15 years old or more , it still leads the way for us , maybe not on classic modes , but for custom game-modes it's ... the perfect game , so many different ways to script plugins , ideas that attract people ... It may be underrated due to newer versions of CS , but as I said , you can't get the same , great and satisfying result in modding the game as in CS 1.6 . A great job , since 2000 :)
1553	1	a	Still better love story than twilight 11/10
1555	1	a	This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:  I remember back in 2010 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over. He didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a such an experience. Playing public servers with mods were very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse. Looking at the current e-sport scene it might not seem like much but back then it was different.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2012. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.   I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games. It's harder though.
1557	1	a	The best ego-shooter ever
1559	1	a	The best version of Counter-Strike!
1561	1	a	1
1563	1	a	Very nice game =)
1565	1	a	I just bought it recently in steam But I've been playing it since my childhood It was my first FPS Game  simply... THE BEST 10/10 &lt;3 XOXO
1567	1	a	Great game
1569	1	a	n1ce gamer 
1571	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥'s tight. 10/10
1573	1	a	no russians to delete my last brain cells
1575	1	a	money in my mind
1577	1	a	11/10 good throwback
1579	1	a	I thinks its best to say this. Theres still 16k people playing a day. That has been said enough. Buy this game now  at least no russians á‘´ Ì¿áŽ² Ì¿á‘·
1581	1	a	Old is Gold
1583	1	a	cs 1.6 is love, cs 1.6 is life.
1585	1	a	this game is juste, simply, clearly perfect, no game could ever get any close to it, i have CS:GO and yet i enjoy a lot more cs 1.6 then CS:GO  good points: - a classic but amazing gameplay suited for thousands and thousands of fun playing - a load of modifications and moded servers with a multitude of skins for best looking game possible (like Zm mod,ZE or BaseBuilder....) - low requirements for it, but yet it allows to play with soooo many people on internet on many servers, as anybody could run this game - very amazing low download size making it pretty much portable (400~Mb of download is still much less then other games) - and ofc, the nice spent hours with friends killing each others as well as working together (RIP to old friendships broken by this game too :P) - diversity of communities to enjoy a sociable envirement and getting new friends Bad points: - graphisme are not good for those who are getting used to nowadays games (some people might overcome this point by simply loving the simplicity of the game) - presence of annoying cheaters on servers and the small management of such problems - no single player mode and even if you fight bots, its not fun.  i think thats all for my review, i've been playing this game for like 4 years now and i still freaking enjoy it and i really recommand it to anyone with powerfull and low pc, it creates unbreakable friendship relations :v
1587	1	a	I love this game.  All of my teammates always say nice things about me. They never tell me they slept with my mom. And the best part about my teammates is that if I get bored of them, I can reroll new friends and even give them cute names. I can even convince the other team to only use knives while I mow them down with machinegun fire. My teammates even protect me and use their body as bullet fodder. And if I get mad? I just type something in the screen and they all die for me so I can win.  It's the happiest and friendliest game on earth.
1589	1	a	Been over 15 years and it's still alive. Never tired of playing it. Original gameplay has been great already and now with mods created by players. CS never dies, it respawns.
1591	1	a	193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193193
1593	1	a	The ancestor of the modern fps game and the longest game i have ever played. I have played this game since i was 10, and now i am 22. Just started playing csgo(the newest generation) this year, and probabaly wont play 1.6 anymore, but i will remember it for ever.
1595	1	a	1.5/1.6
1597	1	a	CUKAM
1599	1	a	My first shooter.
1601	1	a	Nice game 
1603	1	a	I recommend this game more than i recommend losing virginity
1605	1	a	My life &lt; Counter Strike 1.6. Bought this game a bit too late... wish I would've been around to play it back in it's prime.
1607	1	a	Ruined my life :'(
1609	1	a	  This is Amazing Game I Love It I am Playing Since 2009 :)
1611	1	a	Counter-Strike is the mainstay of competitive shooters, with the kind of prestige the likes of Call of Duty strives so hard to achieve. A number of gameplay modes ranging from what used to be the highly popular VIP to the traditional hostage and bomb maps, to eventually leading directly to two now-released sequels and one upcoming release leaves plenty to keep one busy.  'Remember your roots.'  With simple designs to keep things tight and easy to practice (yet nearly impossible to master), Counter-Strike proves that a good shooter can stay in the forefront for over a decade.
1613	1	a	A classic is a classic. Long live 1.6.
1615	1	a	the best game made to date  No mechanics alike insanely amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1617	1	a	Love this wonderful game, it's also my first game on steam and still it's my favourite.

1667	1	a	its a nice game
1669	1	a	Games may come, Games may go.  But nothing's ever gonna replace CS 1.6!  'OLD BUT GOLD'
1671	1	a	wh  vac soon
1673	1	a	Its a famous game, with good entertinment fro FPS game lovers
1675	1	a	Best childhood game!!
1677	1	a	Best fps game ever - hands down.
1679	1	a	Really worth buying it if you have some friends to play it with. Doesn't matter how many years have passed, you can always put togheter your old buddies to play some Counter Strike 1.6
1681	1	a	This game is a timeless classic. It's one of the perfect FPS' that will ever be made. The movement, wall spamming, hitboxes, and map choices are what make this game the best. I've been playing this game since around 2003. Have played tournaments, been an admin for many clans, and strat caller for matches. This game takes serious skill to get good at. There is a huge learning curve, and that's what seperates this from other games, and noobs and pro's. The people who will get good at this game, are the ones who put the time and effort to learn everything. While the game can be a pick up and play game. Expect your â™¥â™¥â™¥ to get handed to you, as veterans of the game still heavily play this, and they'll out shoot you 9/10 times. I have been called a cheater countless times in this game, and it all comes from me playing this day and night as a child, and my skills has also transferred into other FPS games. If you get good at CS, you'll more than likely be very good at other FPS games like Over Watch, CoD, 007, etc. Thats why I nominate this game for, The â€œTest of Timeâ€ Award. My friends think I'm dumb for playing a game developed in the 90's, but there's a reason for it. As I said, this game is the perfect FPS. It's a game I will play until I die. I can buy any new game on the market, and I'll be returning to this game shortly after. Take it from someone who has invested a lot of time in this game to get good. It's going to seem scary at first, as you will get rekt. But you will develop friends from within the various communities, and you will get better over time. And this skill set will make you better at other FPS games. CS 1.6 forever!
1683	1	a	the game that started it all..
1685	1	a	Still better than any other Call of Duty.

1775	1	a	its a cool game i never liked so mutch anithing else like cs 1.6 fast moves fast aim like the recoil like evrything neat game
1777	1	a	This game is a proof that games do not need to have good graphics for it to be fun &amp; addictive. It's one of the games which gives you the oppurtunity to go online &amp; have fun with your friends :D
1779	1	a	This game makes my chizzle wizzle
1781	1	a	Pssss!
1783	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
1785	1	a	This is the one of the best game ever i am playing from 2000.
1787	1	a	Awesome Life Time Game..
1789	1	a	belea
1791	1	a	A fantastic game that improves your fluency in the foreign languages. Every server you visit has the charming alure of Mexicans and Brazillians; an honorable bunch of players who praise your skills with phrases such as 'filho da â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥!!!!!!', 'xiter!!!' and 'jajajajaja'. They are also very skilled players ingame; I often see a single player moving at the speed of sound, headshotting everyone in a blink of an eye, and getting all the praise from his fellow brethren, usually in the form of 'xiter fdp!!!'. Overall, I recommend this game to all individuals seeking to have a fun, non-hacker, non-english gameplay experience.
1793	1	a	This is the Best Game i ever played in my life
1795	1	a	Play It :)
1797	1	a	Dis Is the good game all need buy dis game

1807	1	a	one of the best games i have ever played!
1809	1	a	Really nice game loved it 1.6 is 1.6 ;)
1811	1	a	Cradle of all FPS Multiplayer games for sure!!! played approximately 8 years, spent over 10 000 hours (non steam) during my lifetime, &amp; worth every single minute of playgame !!!! Shame, nowadays there arent many good players, so kinda makes it boring !
1813	1	a	A must have for any PC gamer.
1815	1	a	Dat cyber-cafe memories.
1817	1	a	Great fps for someone who is just looking for some fighting action. graphics are still great for such an old game and servers still get filled!

1857	1	a	best game ever with loads of competition
1859	1	a	game is awesome :D i play this game 9 years but on steam is better :DDDD
1861	1	a	The original FPS shooter game. You should also look into Counter-Strike: Source if you like a more modern version.
1863	1	a	I recomanded this game for is nice. 
1865	1	a	Addicted :| !
1867	1	a	That`s game is fantastic :D
1869	1	a	If you liked one point six of Counter-Strike you might have enjoyed Coldplay.  Also, you're a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing hipster who needs to get off the Gameboy and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing play a game that isn't older then my mother.  BBQhtc - My mother is a saint...
1871	1	a	I wish it was still as active as it was back 8 years ago. Guess we gotta focus on CS GO now, oh the good ole' times.
1873	1	a	This has always been my favorite and a classic to my collection. No matter what, I will always have this game.

1891	1	a	Favorite game ever to chill out and veg on
1893	1	a	Best ever shooting game played in my life i &lt;3 with this game.....
1895	1	a	In my opinion, CS is the single greatest first-person shooter ever created. Complex, addictive, challenging, intense, precise, and infinitely replayable, CS was the defining game for an entire generation of gamers. But be warned, this game is absolutely brutal if you are new to shooters.
1897	1	a	The best shooter,period.No game will ever come close to this one.Love it!
1899	1	a	Back to old fps game? yeah this is the best! Counter Strike is the best online fps game i think..

1915	1	a	my game is best

1935	1	a	10/10
1937	1	a	The most favourite game of mine :D
1939	1	a	good game ,but cheaters.. :/
1941	1	a	.
1943	1	a	Most Legendary game :)
1945	1	a	Truely a game which signifies the value of 'Old is Gold'.... This shows that 'Graphics doesn't matter but Gameplay does'.... The Parent of First Person Shooting Multiplayer... Even though it's been more than a decade since its release but It's still one of the most favoured online games in the world. A must play for any die-hard First Person Shooter lover.
1947	1	a	Such an addictive game! (y)
1949	1	a	the best game ever!
1951	1	a	The Best Game Ever !
1953	1	a	Love everything about this game &lt;3
1955	1	a	Old is Gold
1957	1	a	game cool
1959	1	a	why needed to kill this game? it was and will be the best fps shooter ever, feel like CS:GO just a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ ...   i think the worst idea ever is the 'promod delete', thats a greatest game than Global :)   Im playing since 15 years, had 30+ lan event in Hungary, and i think just should have to use global achievement, LOUNGE (skins,trading,betting,etc..) and matchmaking functions, we have been a great geam what every counter player like, and want to play in any event...   the real counter strike will never die! and original half life engine is the best ever!
1961	1	a	loved this game for years!!!
1963	1	a	Great game, best FPS of all time.

1997	1	a	Great game
1999	1	a	It'a awesome game &lt;3
2001	1	a	Counter-Strike destroyed my life. I had been playing HL deathmatch, and was waiting for team fortress 2 (some of those early TF2 screens are still etched in my brain) I came across a new mod called Counter-Strike, it had just been released, Beta 1 there were only 3 maps I think and the player models were so similar that in the darkend corridors of Mansion you couldn't see who was what, so there was team killing galore, even a console command for extra money, but it was awesome, I'd never played anything like it. So I played it. ALLOT. I'd come in from college stick it on and play untill I was ready for bed, screw school work I had people to shoot in the face! Anyway I failed my A-levels and got stuck with crappy jobs, but looking back, it could possibly have been worth it, because damn I had fun! I don't know what its like nowadays, I did get fed up with the bunnyhopping AWP gits and from what I gather that is the way the game went, but this was it, where it started for me, and if you haven't played it once then you should just so you know where all your call of duty and all that balls came from.
2003	1	a	Great Game &lt;3
2005	1	a	Counter-strike(1.0 - 1.6 not source) is one of the greatest esport fps games(if not the greatest) in the gaming history and is still worth buying today. Graphics doesnt matter for a good gamer, gameplay does...:D
2007	1	a	Counter-Strike is a first-person shooter in which players join either the terrorist team, the counter-terrorist team, or become spectators. Each team attempts to complete their mission objective and/or eliminate the opposing team. Each round starts with the two teams spawning simultaneously.  The objectives vary depending on the type of map, and these are the most usual ones:  Bomb Maps: The terrorists must carry a bomb, plant it on one of the designated spots and protect it from being disarmed by the counter-terrorists before it explodes to win. The counter-terrorists win if the time runs out with no conclusion. Hostage Maps: The counter-terrorists must rescue a group of hostages held by the terrorists to win. The terrorists win if the time runs out with no conclusion. VIP Maps: One of the counter-terrorists is chosen to act as a VIP and the team must escort this player to a designated spot on the map to win the game. The terrorists win if the VIP is killed or if the time runs out with no conclusion.
2009	1	a	legendary game

2017	1	a	Awesome oldschool game.
2019	1	a	BETTER THEN ALL !
2021	1	a	One of the best games, not to even mention first person shooter games, of all time. After 16 years or so since it's release it's still got an avid active following. Speaks volumes for it's addictiveness and replayability.
2023	1	a	After all these years this shooter remains to be a classic that can't be ignored. This game was a major turning point in the history of FPS, and this game is what made online multiplayer competitive gaming so popular.

2085	1	a	Cool game and its awsm (Y)
2087	1	a	Really Good Game!
2089	1	a	^^
2091	1	a	Over a decade later and this game is still the most-played game on Steam and for good reason; solid gameplay, controls, user-generated maps and mods; the list goes on.   This FPS personally serves as a model of comparison whenever I play any other first-person games.
2093	1	a	It was the best game ever made before valve â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ it up!!!And yes i still hardly recommend this hardcore shooter!
2095	1	a	Counter-Strike...  This game is the reason to why I got a Steam account in the first place. I got this game six years ago from a near friend of mine. Everytime I was at his place we used to play this together in turns; he played for a while, maybe 2-3 deaths then I played. We had such a great time. But... the problem was that outside his house we couldn't play the game together.   At the time my dad didn't allow me to buy the game, so my friend ended up giving it to me as a christmas present. Since that day we played it all the time. One of our favorite servers was Eropid (HS Only). He (my friend) ended up beeing in 4-5 place for a while on the server.   Overall, I've had a great time playing this game, and still enjoy playing it today. The game was the start to my FPS gaming interest and since then I've bought every CS released.  I recommed this game to anyone who wants to start play FPS games; as it is a great starting game. I also recommend that you play it with your friends; that way you will get the most fun out of it!   Thanks for reading, and enjoy!   - nitÃ©

2207	1	a	The better version of CS:GO
2209	1	a	I play this game since I was like 14 years old . Teamwork game in most of the times .  Solo game if you are pro . 
2211	1	a	A classic game
2213	1	a	This is the best game ever. Stands the test of time.
2215	1	a	Classic old school game. Still worth it! One of the first and classic FPS games EVER! I highly recommend it and even after at least 15 years there is a playerbase of over 15 000 people. 10/10.
2217	1	a	.
2219	1	a	First Counter-Strike game and the best in my opinion. Everything from models, sounds, game modes, maps is terrific! I recommend this over new installments in the franchise :)
2221	1	a	Classic, never change 1.6. Pls. I went back for a few hours and man it felt good. I played 1.6 first when I was 6.
2223	1	a	The best game, 100% recommended.
2225	1	a	One of the best multiplayer games out there.
2227	1	a	Once loved it, now, full of cheaters, VAC doesn't work like it should, people uses illegal CFGs, scrolls, scripts, ducks right in front of you, you were once a great game... 10/10 would still play it if remaining players didn't turn out to be such illegal noobs.  Back in 2002 THIS WAS THE GREATEST GAME
2229	1	a	its nice game,buy it and make sure
2231	1	a	...
2233	1	a	10/10 would headshot you in the face again
2235	1	a	Surely a pick for fps gamers.
2237	1	a	 No skins, 10/10. Buy this game.
2239	1	a	Since 1999 till todays date 2016 THIS GAME IS LEADING GAME IN THE WORLD  &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 But Ruined by CSGO :D :D gONNA LOVE IT TILL I DIE
2241	1	a	:)
2243	1	a	One of the Best FPS games ever made.
2245	1	a	Since I grew up with Counter-Strike: Source, I can't give a full review on how I feel about this game. But concerning that I am very into the Counter-Strike series I'd have to say this would be a legendary game for me if it was in my time.
2247	1	a	Really enjoyed this FPS. Was the first game i played on a PC and loved every minute of it. Great for first time and more experianced players. Easy controls and have to say that the game runs very smooth. Will highly recommend it guys moving to the PC world from console as I did.
2249	1	a	The Best Game
2251	1	a	I like this game ;).
2253	1	a	Very nice game and very old school FPS :D
2255	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
2257	1	a	The first Counter Strike in the franchise and the community is still there and there are plenty of people who still play it and they are not toxic at all.
2259	1	a	The original Counter Strike came out in 1999 and is still good. El Classico. If you can find a chance to play it, I would highly recommend it. Unlike it successors, you can feel and hit crisp shots that just aren't available in latter versions of CS. 10/10 Would recommend.
2261	1	a	The birthplace of a great idea.
2263	1	a	I get sexually aroused while playing this game.
2265	1	a	Nice game! :D
2267	1	a	:)
2269	1	a	The best old-classic game; walls are made of paper and you can cross with any gun a double-floored concrete but I rly rly rly rly laaik you CS1.6 
2271	1	a	oSAMA
2273	1	a	Can play hours on the game. There are better alternatives but for low graphics this is a good game :D :P
2275	1	a	cool
2277	1	a	I am glad they only started recording playing hours in steam games when i started working full time. I've spent so many hours in this game... Only multiplayer game that I played and still play from time to time.
2279	1	a	:*
2281	1	a	easy game for relaxation
2283	1	a	Been playing this game since it came out and I love it. I wanna take some time to thank the original developer for this exiting game.
2285	1	a	is good game for ever
2287	1	a	My childhood game &lt;3
2289	1	a	Very nic game! 
2291	1	a	 It was very good at his time, and now...   a little bit.  
2293	1	a	The Best Game Fo all Gamer's !
2295	1	a	Been playing this game since 2007 AND I LOVE IT!!!
2297	1	a	~!!!
2299	1	a	IS THE BEST
2301	1	a	Counter-Strike! Awhh what can I say about this master piece? well, It's one of the best first-person shooters that have ever been made, still today you can find tons of peeople playing online! Don't be fooled by how many ours I've got playing this game on steam, I've played since early 2004, this game is practicaly my childhood. LOL You cannot compare this game to CS:GO, with modern graphics and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, yet both of them are incredible on its way. I love the fact that you don't have scope blur when you walk, the fact that M4A1 and USP have enough bullets. Love it!   I rate it 15/10 
2303	1	a	Even after over 16 years on the video game market, Counter Strike claims thousands of followers.  Guns feel just right Maps feel just right Graphics look just right and isn't outdated at all(Youngsters not accustomed to late 1990s PC graphics might disagree).  You will play CS 1.6 FOREVER. I'll probably play CS 1.6 zombie mode until the I have arthritis.
2305	1	a	  Best game for all time!!
2307	1	a	Normal computer games !!
2309	1	a	:]
2311	1	a	  the best game
2313	1	a	The best game :)
2315	1	a	Classic.
2317	1	a	Old but gold
2319	1	a	One of the best 1st Player game.
2321	1	a	Good game but CSGO is better imo
2323	1	a	Yes its A Very Nice Game .. :)
2325	1	a	Old memories *-*
2327	1	a	  1111111111111111111111111111
2329	1	a	One wordd to describe this game:CHILDHOOD.
2331	1	a	Awesomly Fantastic game
2333	1	a	Best game! Immortal!!!
2335	1	a	LOVE COUNTER-STRIKE :D
2337	1	a	EPIC and LEGENDARY game
2339	1	a	The Best game ever made!!
2341	1	a	Comparing the game to CS:GO.    Pros:      Variation in lighting (darker rooms), along with flashlights and nightvision.    No background/ambient sounds in most maps (clear sound) (easier to hear footsteps and gunfire).    You can wallbang most things/walls in most maps.    Buying amunition (more depth in economical strategy).    MP5 ('nuff said)    Movement is much smoother and bunnyhopping is much more consistant and fluent, you feel much heavier in cs:go.    You can run the game on a toaster.    Character selection (I just think its pretty awesome).    Spraying (spray paint), boobs make for a great strategical distraction.    Customizing textures, maps, models ect. is great, you can mod almost anything you want, unlike in CS:GO.    No marketing system (skins), this one is a bit of a debate, personally I'm ok with skins (I've even spent money on it myself), but I prefer to mod a game rather than having to pay for a nice looking gun. Skins, simply put, are a way to milk the players money. Im thankful that CS 1.6 doesn't have this.    CS 1.6 has a classic/nostalgic feel to it, some people will like that, some people won't.    People still play the game, proving the game isn't dead yet.    There are many different and interesting modded game modes in 1.6 such as surfing, zombie, bunny hopping, jailbreak, deathmatch, gungame.     Cons:      Matchmaking in CS:GO is better, it is simpler and places you in a server with people around your level.    Grenade physics are awkward and hard to learn.    Viewing and casting games is much better/easier in CS:GO.    Few weapons are viable in CS 1.6, mostly just the AK, M4, AWP, Deagle and MP5    Sometimes bad/terrible hit registration.    Tactical shield.    No ranking system, personally, I don't care about having a pretty symbols with a bunch of arrows and stars, or having stupid rank names like 'SERGEANT MASTER ELITE SHOOTER PERSON', the only reason I'm putting it on this list is because ranking helps put players with other players that are about the level. In 1.6, any new player will find themselves playing against people leagues better than said player.    I did mention before that modded servers were great, but it can also be a problem, there are few classic CS 1.6 servers that aren't modded, most of them being deathmatch servers with 32 players, it's hard to find normal CS game modes.    Hacking is a issue in CS 1.6, worse than in CS:GO. It's harder to get VAC Banned in 1.6 and there aren't any features like Overwatch in CS:GO, to make it easier to detect hackers.    Servers can change your bindings and send you to other servers, this isn't a big problem as there are ways around it but it's still present.    The game no longer gets any updates, I know this isn't the games fault but there are still exploits and bugs in 1.6.   Some people will agree these pros and cons and some won't. I'm not saying this game is necessarily better than CS:GO, but it sure is a fun experience. I would definately recommend this game to anyone who likes FPS games, especially people who play CS:GO. The game takes a while to get used to but once you do, you will find yourself playing this game for days. I havn't played this game too much, so theres probably a lot I'm missing. That concludes my review.
2343	1	a	It's a great game, join us! =)
2345	1	a	classic counter-strike
2347	1	a	Cool FPS game.Highly recommended!

2353	1	a	Nice game!
2355	1	a	Nice fps game
2357	1	a	Why not
2359	1	a	Easy to learn , but hard to master.
2361	1	a	When you just want to shoot people in the face and rage because they shot you in the face, play this.
2363	1	a	No doubt it was called the god of mp games. :)
2365	1	a	My favourite game. At leats 6000 hours.

2379	1	a	 Two certainties
2381	1	a	Definitely a classic game, where it all started. If you're into CS then you must pickup this game and give it a try!
2383	1	a	iS-Cs
2385	1	a	  &lt;3 love it *__*
2387	1	a	.
2389	1	a	That is a very interesting game, a very nice shooter game.
2391	1	a	What i like in this game: Gunplay, good gun sounds and they give suitable physical impact, although animations haven't aged well ;) Teamwork/cooperation aspect, not very complicated, no real different player classes, but obviously a sniper won't go to assault tasks with the primary weapon at least Highly customisable, skins, sounds, textures, makes this game fitting for so many different kindsa players with a relatively little effort  Then, things i don't like in this game: Graphics, that's the only thing really, but the good thing is the simple old graphics make everything clear to see and distinguish
2393	1	a	cs 1.6 forever
2395	1	a	  CS 1.6

2443	1	a	I've been playing CS 1.6 since it's release in 2000 and I haven't stopped since, it's a great game.
2445	1	a	Game Of the Century It is.
2447	1	a	Hello,i have been playing this game for almost 8 years now,and as it seems,the game started to be less popular due to cheaters and hackers! I would recommend everybody to purchase this game and try it out,there is a lot of servers that use WH/AIM Blocks and are not able to cheat on the servers. Valve is banning more and more people with Valve Anti Cheat so yeah,keep up the good work Valve!
2449	1	a	A classic.
2451	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ 10/10

2461	1	a	55
2463	1	a	Counter-Strike: Ok, after 9 years of unlimited fun with friends, I have finally quit counter strike. Counter strike, in all of its versions, its just a great FPS game that anyone can enjoy it. Its a great game and all, you just cant stop playing it, you can just sit and play with your friends for days with out stoping. The huge weaoponary option you can choose and the smooth and sound of the game, its just f*cking addicting. With this games I've met so many different people and unique friends. This game is literally G(OLD). To all the young players who are looking for a good cheep and fun game to play with their friends, I highlly recommend on this. I've got (with steam record) 2,484hrs record in counter strike IN TOTTAL,,, and who knows how many more hrs in a non official steam version of this game.... Great Game. GG WP. And too all the people who will keep playing this game, all I can say, as always, GL &amp; HF &lt;3

2475	1	a	Classic multiplayer shooter, one of the best!
2477	1	a	:)
2479	1	a	very nice game
2481	1	a	A great game to play, if you are used to CS:GO this game will have a massive learning curve to it. The style CS 1.6 has developed is very different than from what CS:GO needs.
2483	1	a	Overrated, but it's good.
2485	1	a	very good game play
2487	1	a	Really good, skill game, I spent a lot of hours playing this game (Not on this account), probably better than CS:GO. :)
2489	1	a	One of the best First Person Shooters on the planet still to this date!
2491	1	a	I Like This Game :*
2493	1	a	A classic in the genre. Still a lot of players playing it. Not the best looking multiplayer FPS out there, but very fun to play.

2555	1	a	Simply My Life Is CS , Still the best fps game
2557	1	a	Why are you reading a Counter-Strike review? You should already own it. Just buy it. For yourself. Now. :)
2559	1	a	This game sucks.
2561	1	a	$1000+ for my new comp and all i play is CS 1.6

2573	1	a	level design reminiscent of the cincinati landscapes
2575	1	a	One Of The Best Games !;)
2577	1	a	Best of the Best  Master of all FPS games
2579	1	a	Play Hard Play fair Go Pro
2581	1	a	If you like shooting the bad guys then this is one of the games for you. When Counter-Strike was originally released in 2000, I didn't play it because I was like 1 year old. I play it now because of the fast/slow paced actions and the guns. There are a bunch of guns in Counter-Strike that you can use. There are little guns that are cheap, and big guns that are expensive. But here lies the problem with Counter-Strike... people don't even use all of the guns! Whenever I find onto a server, all of the players are only using the black gun, the brown gun, the silver gun, and the green gun. Even though there is a bunch of weapons, they aren't really all used much of the time. In the end, I play Counter-Strike because my computer is afraid of Counter-Strike: Source.
2583	1	a	My first FPS game onlinr, awesome experience,best maps, overall really loved it
2585	1	a	This game has shields O.O
2587	1	a	Very Nice! Great time! 2006 best dreams...
2589	1	a	its super hard to play if you have played csgo before it
2591	1	a	This is one of the greatest games I have ever played, full of modifications, active and cool!! Can't say more.
2593	1	a	Best game ever... fact
2595	1	a	Been playing this game for 5 years plus and it isw still absolutely fun. Quite in fact a better game than Counter-Strike source or Couter-Strike condition zero. Great Gameplay (Scrims or for fun) Many mods I've played are quite good like Zombies, Trouble in terrorist town, surfing, and jailbreak. All are very nice to make the game relavent and quite new. I highly recommend thisw game.
2597	1	a	For low computers is this game oldschool,but still GOOD classic game.If you have good PC you are playing cs:go. If you have a bad pc you are playing 1.6 ðŸ˜ƒ
2599	1	a	This game is awesome
2601	1	a	haven't played it enough to make a good review but it is an alright game from what i've experienced
2603	1	a	Wonder if this game will get old...
2605	1	a	It's like the most played game ever in the history of fps games.
2607	1	a	Still a great game, worth playing for anyone who likes the Counter Strike games. Don't let the outdated graphics turn you away from this, who said graphics mattered anyways right?
2609	1	a	One of the best FPS ever. :X
2611	1	a	Counter Strike is the most popular fps game we played in windows pc.
2613	1	a	very very nice game :D goooood job
2615	1	a	It's â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing Counter-Strike. What are you reading this for? BUY IT ALREADY.
2617	1	a	The next best version of Counter-Strike after the now defunct CS 1.5.
2619	1	a	Recomand!
2621	1	a	its like csgo but it isnt â™¥â™¥â™¥ and you can get away with micspam and wallhacks and all kinds of goofy mods without valve forcing you to use viewmodels so you can see their fancy skins
2623	1	a	Hands down the best Counter-Strike ever made. It have the fun in it that no other game have. The feeling when u play for a example a Warcraft server. The time you put in and playing that game for so long. Don't buy CS:Go. But this sh*t 10/10
2625	1	a	The original Counter-Strike. The one who gave life to both CS:S and CS:GO. I first played this game when i was 7 (over 10 years ago) and i never forget how difficult it was for me to kill an enemy. However, this is great game and game that certainly belongs in the 'Top 10 Games of All Time'.
2627	1	a	You are a pro gamer? Want to play against other pro players? This is for you!!!!!!!!!!!!! This game deserve a golden medal!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Masterpiece!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 10 out of 10 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2629	1	a	hye, thats prettu guud
2631	1	a	Best shooting game ever!
2633	1	a	A cheap and simple FPS shooter. 10/10
2635	1	a	Classic and yet still the one of the most entertaining FPS-style shooters that has ever set foot on earth. Gameplay mechanics are fun and yet challenging. Game provides many different gamemodes from regular deathmatch-bomb plant mission to platformer style of gamemodes. Overall an awesome game and I recommend it to anyone who has any cs experience or has any interest in FPS-shooters :)
2637	1	a	Is an nice game
2639	1	a	Does this even need a real review?
2641	1	a	BEST CS EVA
2643	1	a	Best game ever can't believe it's still alive.
2645	1	a	Counter-Strike is only available to play in multiplayer; no bots. So you're forced to connect to someone else's server and put up with randomness and repetitive maps. And of course, it's the GoldSource Engine and all that entails.  Counter-Strike: Condition Zero is considerably more fun, in my opinion. You get all the same weapons, but there's a pseudo-story mode, AI bots to play with, and different objectives and a variety of maps you hop around, all of them challenging you in new ways. Kind of like the current campaign contracts in Global Offensive and Team Fortress 2.  Get this game (package), especially if it's on sale. If not for the classic-ness (or nostalgia), then get it for the great single-player experience with Condition Zero.
2647	1	a	cheaternoob
2649	1	a	Cant beat a Classic... unless you just kill it with a bunch of bot servers. Still the king of the online fps.  For the record CS1.4 on the WON ID system (Way before SteamId's) was the best version.
2651	1	a	Pure cancer i like it
2653	1	a	Oldest Counter-Strike is the best, because people play 4 fun, they want to be better and better. People don't play to upgrade their 'ranks' like in CS:GO.
2655	1	a	It's a 2000 game style but it steel like old school games. Low quality,low pixels that's the reason why this game is so popular.
2657	1	a	Awesome game. First FPS I ever got good at and still to this day I can load it up and have fun playing this game. This game has a lot of history behind it and it probably the foundation for a lot of the new FPS most notably CoD(Call of Duty). Thanks to this game I learned how to play an FPS properly and will alway enjoy playing this game no matter how old it is!
2659	1	a	the best game in the world, a child â™¥
2661	1	a	Absolutely recommended.
2663	1	a	++
2665	1	a	VERy GOOD GAME !
2667	1	a	Most popular game for low computers!
2669	1	a	BEST GAME !!
2671	1	a	Life is 1 but, Counter Strike is 1.6
2673	1	a	Still the best Counter Strike ever created to this day.
2675	1	a	The game is good, I'm playing it for 2-3 years and I am stupend, good graphics and good resolution, I recomend this game is interesting
2677	1	a	A GREAT!!!! First Person Shooter that requires skill and not spray and pray :D , I suggest anyone to buy this game
2679	1	a	Pretty much the best FPS evar!
2681	1	a	This game never gets old. The only thing you can improve is your skill 10/10.
2683	1	a	The classic which is Counter-Strike.  A game that has been a platform for many competitive FPS games. Also a platform to E-Sports becoming prevalent in popular culture.   Buy this game and reminisce of what CS once was.   It is perfect and it works every time.
2685	1	a	Take new price please!! Is best game 4ever
2687	1	a	its okay i guess
2689	1	a	  8700 hours :D
2691	1	a	Old but Gold!!
2693	1	a	;)
2695	1	a	It's cool classic!
2697	1	a	Great FPS game :)
2699	1	a	Totally awesome game playing from many years in love with this game
2701	1	a	My Love â™¥
2703	1	a	old is gold...awesome game
2705	1	a	The real version of Counter-Strike classic..... played like crazy during my childhood.....
2707	1	a	KlubPenguin1234ABC: Put The awp down you nuuub u suck uninstall the game  Trolliee341: I Can Keep this awp you 2 year old. KlubPenguin1234ABC: I WILL HACK YOUR WEBKINZ ACCOUNT!!!!! 
2709	1	a	The OG to CS:GO.
2711	1	a	Best game..Start playing and you end up having addiction to this game..
2713	1	a	The gameplay is old-fashioned and fun. The community is casual, immersive and usually lacking the children. It's everything you want from a game you play in your spare time.
2715	1	a	If you like classics, here is something you should probably get. A mod from half-life released one year after half-life it is still one of the most played games in the world bringing players from all over the place to enjoy together. It has a rather simple gameplay and you're able to get most of it in a few minutes but at the same time it requires training if you want to be able to play well.
2717	1	a	Better than Source, better than GO.   But for some reason, people always prefer graphics over actual balanced gameplay.
2719	1	a	My name is Bob.
2721	1	a	Recommended
2723	1	a	I love this game because way to give headshots better than cs go and sometimes players in the severs calling me hacker if they dead by me ImfaooðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜˜ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¿ðŸ™ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸
2725	1	a	Oh, you are a bloody hacker and i cannot shoot you through your heart. 10/10
2727	1	a	Nostalgia Nostalgia! There is no nostalgia in that it sets good to have this life counter strike!
2729	1	a	Best game, my first fps game :D
2731	1	a	The original just simply can't be beaten
2733	1	a	Awsome :))
2735	1	a	An amazing game with an abundance of hacks to choose from for those that want more from their games.
2737	1	a	This game is fun. It have got bad graphic but that is ok . I recommend It.
2739	1	a	Fire in the hole simulator 1999 edition
2741	1	a	another one bites de_dust
2743	1	a	The best game there was and there will be! Great balance and impressive legendary games.
2745	1	a	very good game trust me i been in this business for years.
2747	1	a	....
2749	1	a	this game was the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ its the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, dont â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ with this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ cos this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ suprerior to your â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
2751	1	a	Great game.
2753	1	a	Just recently started playing this game. But so far it is so much fun, have not played it with friends yet but when I do it will be 10 more times the fun.
2755	1	a	oldest in the class, still the best.
2757	1	a	Back to the classics! Never forgetting the thousands of hours I played this game, looking through every mod and searching for tons of unofficial versions of the game, because I couldn't afford it. I started playing 5v5s in Source and now I am searching for PUGs in 1.6 too. It will be so fun when I find some!
2759	1	a	One of the best games ever made ;) Definitely in FPS' Hall of Fame.
2761	1	a	The best game valve made after Cs:Go but the updates made the game very poor :( wish it could be like in the past
2763	1	a	Good game.Classic's !
2765	1	a	10/10 would play again!
2767	1	a	I really like this game.It's old but so good!
2769	1	a	Best FPS of all time.
2771	1	a	Very addictive game ðŸ˜ƒ
2773	1	a	Better than CSGO Why? Less Russians  No Hackers Guns does not do fast aims Less rage than CSGO But bad graphics and low quality 8/10
2775	1	a	I remember skipping school and going to internet cafes to play this game... good times!
2777	1	a	:)
2779	1	a	Classic. Loved it when it came out and I still play it sometimes.
2781	1	a	It has a simple concept. Nothing complicated.
2783	1	a	Played a few min good game
2785	1	a	 It all started here.   I could also say ' I born here '.  What can I say, just the best game I've ever played!
2787	1	a	Just like the good ole' days

2811	1	a	Old school and awesome ;D
2813	1	a	nice game, playing this game sometimes too feel nostalgia.
2815	1	a	CS 1.6 4 life!
2817	1	a	best tho :^D
2819	1	a	One of the best, if not the best oldschool games out there!
2821	1	a	:)
2823	1	a	This is the beginning. This is where all started. Awesome game of all times.  Up until CS:GO came out, no other FPS shooter compared to this games phisics.
2825	1	a	old is gold ^_^
2827	1	a	thebest Game &lt;3 I LOVE
2829	1	a	Used to be my favorite game till I was introduced to CS:GO. This game is the basic for all the players whom have just started to play CS. They should slowly grow up simply by starting off from this game.
2831	1	a	Great Game....Can play ofline and Online too.
2833	1	a	Best multyplayer shooter
2835	1	a	.
2837	1	a	So I joined CS at CS:GO, and I just bought this. ITS AMAZING!
2839	1	a	its an awesome game ever
2841	1	a	my first game
2843	1	a	this a good game i like the maps and the community in the game  
2845	1	a	All-time classic iconic multiplayer. 10/10.
2847	1	a	Best oldschool game ever, and still playable... but only one think is frustrating me is cheaters...
2849	1	a	Invaded by ethnicities with bad computers and awful ideas with their server management, it is now impossible as of today to get a decent match without paying for ESEA, even in PUG servers.  Not being racist, this is what actually happened. Surf servers and Fun servers finally died around 2011, whilst vanilla servers that ain't running dust 2 all day long died before Steam even came out, and all that's left is a bunch of latino-controlled servers with â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥-awful maps and enough plugins to give you a seizure and a thousand hats.
2851	1	a	this is perhaps the first game that I play on PC
2853	1	a	I.LOVE.CS This Game IS SOOOOO FUN Too Bad The fanbase is dead for this game but i got csgo and cscz but when i hit Z,X,C It crashes So i recomend CSCZ
2855	1	a	You better have a really beefy pc to run this game
2857	1	a	cheated
2859	1	a	The best game ever.
2861	1	a	Russian and Spanish simulator

2923	1	a	Still one of the best shooters ever
2925	1	a	Is The Best Shooter
2927	1	a	Counter Strike is a great game. Even though it has outdated graphics it still has great gameplay. There are different game modes. 1 is where you have to defuse a bomb or plant a bomb and the other you have to rescue hostages and thats just to name a few. You will definetley enjoy playing this game.
2929	1	a	Bought this game (CS anthology bundle) back in 06 from a gaming store in Lamington road and it has been fun playing this every now and then whenever there are good public servers for this game. This game introduced me to STEAM platform as it was a very popular mod of Half-Life. It has been worth every penny to buy this game and I still play it more than I play CSGO.  I get reasonable pings (&lt;50) and I am on MTNL in Mumbai.  If you are newbie lookin to buy I'd recommend you buy the Valve's complete pack during a major sale.
2931	1	a	I'M REALLY GLAD THAT I BOUGHT THIS GAME,BRINGS ME BACK MEMORIES FROM CHILDHOOD!
2933	1	a	This is a classic game, I have playing this since my childhood :) I am joking not since childhood since game launched. I recommend this game to my all friends.
2935	1	a	Still awesome

2955	1	a	Best FPS Game of all time. 10 years later here i am still playing this game, it groomed an Entire generation of Players and made way for Pro Gaming on internation scale.  Counter Strike is LOVE . Counter Strike is LIFE!  10/10
2957	1	a	it's alright
2959	1	a	Nice game
2961	1	a	Best FPS of all time
2963	1	a	...
2965	1	a	What, there's no skins ?
2967	1	a	Very â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ recoil . 10/10 would play again.
2969	1	a	No FPS will ever beat this one . Enough said.
2971	1	a	History !!!! &lt;3
2973	1	a	Despite its age, this shooter has not lost its appeal and is still one of the best shooting games of all time.
2975	1	a	What else is there left to say about Counter-Strike. Are you a FPS god, love fancy knifes, guns and killing all your friends? Then this game is probably for you. For everybody else, us FPS noobs, this is a fun past time with your equally bad friends. Learn how to crouch, how to hide and how to be called a 'stupid, sniping c**t'. Just buy the game already!
2977	1	a	Nice game
2979	1	a	This game should win steam award for game, which is best through time. Competitive play in gaming started by counter strike serial of games.
2981	1	a	Counter-Strike, Gta 3 and Age of Empires 1 are first games that i played on my first pc. I still own all three of them on original cd and til this day i occasionally play them. They bring back some good old memories when i was a kid :)
2983	1	a	Grew up on this staple diet of face banging and still go back to play after 9 years!
2985	1	a	I like this game
2987	1	a	It's csgo but cheaper and it's easier to aim and you can run it on a potato PC
2989	1	a	Best FPS game ever made. Also: Matt is the best at it.
2991	1	a	2016/2000
2993	1	a	  Hey There Counter-Strike 1.6 Is The Best â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ the REST
2995	1	a	One of the best multiplayer-shooter ever! A real must have! Unforntunately 90% of players are cheating :( So sad!
2997	1	a	Great Game
2999	1	a	very good team based game
3001	1	a	Nice game :)
3003	1	a	I'm into old games. Ye. c:
3005	1	a	Will always remain the top game in my eyes
3007	1	a	Old school first person shooter. Great game, no doubt.
3009	1	a	Classic, the fundamental game of all these days shooters
3011	1	a	=)
3013	1	a	10/10 Best Game With Good Graphics but need to update
3015	1	a	I still play it sometimes.
3017	1	a	 PROS:  + great gameplay + big active community + great choice of weapons + huge amount of mods + lots of community created maps, weapons, AI, soundtracks, etc.   CONS:  - rare issues with graphic cards (especially for laptops) - has replacement in form of newer CS games   Comment:  What is there to introduce? This is a FPS game that most gamers know and the ones that don't should. The laughable half an hour I have displayed here was just testing out the newly bought game. In reality I have played many many many hours with my friends. I played it in high school. I played it in college. I played it with friends after work. While the graphics may be old and this game replaced by its' younger sibblings it still holds out the test of time. While I am no longer able to get my friends together and play this , this game will always be a fond memory for me. And who knows maybe I will pick it up some day again. What I can do is recommend this game to anyone who has not played it or people who are thinking about pruchasing this digital copy. The basic concept of terrorists vs. counter-terrorists is really fun and with the modding community the amount of variation is almost limitless. So grab it if you can, it is very much worth it.
3019	1	a	The best game ever played :) enjoing abou 12 years :) thanks valve
3021	1	a	Classic.
3023	1	a	The first game that struck down like lightning, stole our souls and maked us fight with parents to make them understand that you can't PAUSE an ONLINE game.  I remember the early day's of playing and the less than professional LAN parties we arranged in someones house. I can't think of ANYONE in my hometown that did not play this game (BEFORE STEAM even existed) This was the game that brought us all together on weekends, schoolbreaks and we even went as far as moving large CRT monitors just to game. I would like to see the lazy youths of today arrange a LAN where everyone had to carry a large 19inch CRT monitor with them :)  All the drunken insanity of 20youths in a basement-LAN (NO INTERNET!), killing eachother and sharing files on DC++. This was GOOD times or maybe Im just nostalgic about it...  It stole my youth, costed A LOT of keyboards (JÃ„VLA AWP BÃ–G?!) and drove our parents insane. AND NO UPDATES BREAKING THE GAME ALL THE TIME LIKE CS: GO.  What you bought was what you got and not a different game every month due to updates...  10/10 would waste my youth on this game again
3025	1	a	This is my childhood game :) thanks Counter Strike's developers for developing this such a great game!
3027	1	a	  Very fantastic game Very fantastic game
3029	1	a	i dont know any game better than this...
3031	1	a	The classics and one of the best from my childhood.
3033	1	a	  Very fantastic game Very fantastic game
3035	1	a	i dont know any game better than this...
3037	1	a	This (mod) game is the reason I bought Half-Life. It had that certain formula that elicits all the right neurotransmitters to keep addicted and craving more.
3039	1	a	This game made me who i am now. Amazing player in FPS games. I really love this game and i hope you do so
3041	1	a	Awesome game. All computers can open, but you will have skills and play so much time this game. Soooooooooooo I can't say anything. :) This game is all times mutiplayer!!! :D
3043	1	a	  Legendary team shooter of all time!  
3045	1	a	Sucks â™¥â™¥â™¥ but hell of a game.
3047	1	a	Awsome game 10/10
3049	1	a	Still the best fps
3051	1	a	Oldschool Classics!
3053	1	a	Best game in the world :)
3055	1	a	The REAL Counter-Strike.  100% Skil, no â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t skins and what not.
3057	1	a	'Test of Time' award was made for this game imo...
3059	1	a	Old but GOLD
3061	1	a	The Retro feeling when playing this game just dosen't let me stop coming back to 1.6
3063	1	a	10/10 my life is this game
3065	1	a	It's OK.
3067	1	a	very fun fps game
3069	1	a	Old, but still a great classic. If you like classic FPS games, recommended.
3071	1	a	This game might be old but it's gold I really recommend this game very fun
3073	1	a	An overwhelmingly great shooter. This game takes skill and tactics, and lots of teamwork. The community isnt perfect though. There are lots of dumb trashtalking players and people that whine whenever they die. If you can ignore that, then you will have an amazing experience.
3075	1	a	Where are the cases, and no knives? 0/10
3077	1	a	189.1.171.113:27027 EAC@MAXIGAMES
3079	1	a	Oldschool game, but it's fun.
3081	1	a	Have a PC that you bought in the 1990s? Want the discount global offensive experience without the crate opening bullsh*t? Do you want to play a true first person shooter? Are you looking to impress your crush with shooting skills although you don't have any? Do you want to appear like a whiny edgy â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ in front of your parents while giving your friends lessons on when to rush A or B?  This is the game you play.
3083	1	a	My Life &lt;3
3085	1	a	UMP 45 the best weapon!

3091	1	a	UMP 45 the best weapon!
3093	1	a	Good old CS it's a good game if you're looking for nostalgia.
3095	1	a	What can I say?  It's just the best game I've ever played, and it's my favourite game. So simple, and loads of fun, many mods, exciting, entertaining, utterly exciting and 'addictive', and there's always new maps.  There's many new games with better graphics, but Counter-strike is the best, and will still the best first-person shooter ever.  Oh, and I knew Steam by this game.   +10/10
3097	1	a	remember ! if u shot to wall on de_nuke or whatever map, u will get double kill or annother lol kill on annother map xD fkin hilarious &amp; bay for noaimed pro players, this can be callled start ramp to csgo. Coz u dont need aim there &amp; csgo also.
3099	1	a	beast
3101	1	a	This game was nearly the first one I have ever played and still is in top 10. Don't be surprised that I have so little hours played onto my account, becouse I am still playing onto my half-life version with official cd-key.(played like 1000+ hours). This game is totally worth buying if you like playing in cooperation with friends. 2 team are tying to kill each other with one life. Point is: Terrorists are supposed to destroy a bombsite and Counter Terrorists are supposed to defend it. It works the same in hostage rescue, CT has to take hostages to safety. But if you are looking for a counter strike and good graphics, don't look here. Try CS:Source or Global Offensive.
3103	1	a	A true revolution in first person shooters. A feat of engineering. Masterpiece in art. Simple yet in every way functional. Something which has embedded itself in even the oldest adn dustiest of HDD's. A creation unerasable by even the gods themselves
3105	1	a	this is a goood game and he is my favorite game
3107	1	a	16 years old and over double the players playing at once than the newest CoD. That should tell you something
3109	1	a	If you hate this game, visit the doctor.
3111	1	a	A true revolution in first person shooters. A feat of engineering. Masterpiece in art. Simple yet in every way functional. Something which has embedded itself in even the oldest adn dustiest of HDD's. A creation unerasable by even the gods themselves
3113	1	a	Never forgotten classic
3115	1	a	beast
3117	1	a	game play 10/10 servers 8/10 anti-cheat -1/10  if u like old school aim games  just buy it
3119	1	a	Very old FPS with an awesome AK-47 recoil (Í¡ Í¡Â° Íœ ã¤ Í¡Í¡Â°) I play it on a potato at +69fps and I die cuz I'm noob. So wat ? Buy it and get me if you can. (ï½¡â—•â€¿â€¿â—•ï½¡) I'm recommending this game if you play on a Pentium IV with your r3t@rÄ‘ friends. Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
3121	1	a	Am I really writing a recommendation for this game?  Counter-Strike  or CS 1.6  is a classic game which started off as a Half-Life 1 mod way back in late 1999, and was later sold in 2000 which required both Half-Life 1 and the game itself. Where as now, you only need the game itself on Steam.   Counter-Strike was one of the biggest multiplayer FPS games ever made, due to it being playable on many computers, and just an overall really fun game. It has no doubt made a huge impact on the world of FPS. Especially in the competitive scene such as e-sports where 1.6 is still being played today.  However, it has aged. A lot. Especially in comparison to Counter-Strike: Source. So a lot of maps are quite spacious and don't look as realistic as many would expect to todays standards.   I actually prefer CS:S over this game as I just like the feel of it more.  I honestly don't know why I'm reviewing this game, as I'm sure everyone on my friends list here has played it. But just incase you're that one odd person out that for osme reason hasn't played it - try it out, and see whether you like it or not. 
3123	1	a	WOW THIS GAME JUST NEVER GETS OLD :) ONE OF THE BEST EVER! EPIC!
3125	1	a	Despite all the yuears that have passed , Counter-Strike is still one great online shooter that is fun and challenging to play . However be warned : You will be killed countless times until you master this game .  Final Score : 8/10 ( Great )  Full video Review :  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ap_HeTcwY2c 
3127	1	a	It's classic FPS shooter game which I have been playing since it's been released and I still play it. Can't let it go entirely. If you are looking for a game with many different modes available this is a game for you. Example of available mods(servers with special modes are available online) are zombie mod, plague mod, paintball mod, soccer mod, jailbreak mod, gungame mod and many more!
3129	1	a	it's like CS:GO....but losing isn't even that bad in this one. which makes it better. no ranks which is also nice
3131	1	a	Still fantastic after all these years. The game that molded a generation.
3133	1	a	One of the best FPS.
3135	1	a	!!!!!!!!
3137	1	a	!!!!!!!!
3139	1	a	Best FPS ever. I have a lot of memories with this game.
3141	1	a	World best game :)
3143	1	a	Tbh after a lot of hours on Warzone my opinion hasn't changed.This game is great.
3145	1	a	.
3147	1	a	Tbh after a lot of hours on Warzone my opinion hasn't changed.This game is great.
3149	1	a	Classic! One of the most fun older games that I own. The community is still large and thriving! Give it a try!!!! :)
3151	1	a	very good game, you should try it :D
3153	1	a	I buy the AWP and I win.  I recommend this game whole heartedly.  10/10
3155	1	a	10/10
3157	1	a	VALVE PLEASE ADD RANK SISTEM IN COUNTER STIKE 1.6 !! Like this post if you want RANK SISTEM in Counter ! VALVEE please 'FINAL UPDATE' &lt;3 &lt;3 SPAM everywhere, Gaben must see this :) RANK SISTEM &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
3159	1	a	The best game!
3161	1	a	better than cs:go
3163	1	a	The other Counter Strikes are just a game (good game if you prefer)! THIS IS COUNTER STRIKE ! THIS IS IT ! ITS THE ONLY COUNTER STRIKE ! PLAY &amp; KEEP YOUR HEAD DOWN WHEN YOU'VE BEEN KNIVED ! *** NOTE:Check My Review of Half-life 1, its a long review and its actually all about counter strike ! i give this game 10/10 Reviewed By IMMORTALEADER
3165	1	a	 CS 1.6 Is Love CS 1.6 Is Life      Best shooter in History of Gaming   
3167	1	a	The only reason why people are buying this game now, is for them just to say 'yea, Ive played cs 1.6'.
3169	1	a	it's older than the people who play cs go.
3171	1	a	No ranks No smurfs No cheaters No russians No headshots in leg No 57 in 8 (Glock) Deagle has better accuracy than awp 10/10
3173	1	a	One of the best classics, still has more players than CoD :D :D
3175	1	a	This game is so competitive. This sport takes $15 bucks to play but if you want to play the game properly it'll take 16 years to master, this is the one stop shop for the PC Master Race when looking for a Multi-Player First Person Shooters.
3177	1	a	BEST shooter of my childhood  ( Junior High School )
3179	1	a	One of best games in da world.. :)
3181	1	a	most awesome game ever
3183	1	a	great game........
3185	1	a	Old but gold :)
3187	1	a	this is counter strike: source, it's a video game.  10/10 it's counter strike: source.
3189	1	a	Best FPS Game ever, I will never chance my opinion. :-)
3191	1	a	This game is still awesome.
3193	1	a	An iconic game, perhaps the best game of all time, please buy it. 10/10
3195	1	a	Can't find any people who speak english. That's okay, because I'm Osama.
3197	1	a	The game is great. Has the full potential, the graphics and gameplay are doing it.
3199	1	a	My story began with the Counter-Strike of 2007 to the end now
3201	1	a	Old School is always the best.
3203	1	a	Seriously Counter Strike is awesome all of them Go,Source,The original all amazing! So go on buy them...im serious....do it...NOW.
3205	1	a	Very good game! And easy to play even for begingers! I totaly recommend this game!
3207	1	a	Long live cs 1.6
3209	1	a	It's a good game but i got some kinda grapical bug and i need very much help and i can't see my grapical settings just cuz somthing makes me see a little bit of the menu screen would like some help :D
3211	1	a	Of course I do. This is probably one of the best FPS games of all times.
3213	1	a	i bought the counter-strike complete pack and i've never regreted buying it
3215	1	a	Pretty epic classic
3217	1	a	Very Cool game
3219	1	a	huge classic, everyone should own this
3221	1	a	The good old Counterstrike never seems tiring and boring. I still play it till date alongwith Counterstrike : Global Offensive. Valve should release update for the remaining bugs and glitches and revamp the graphics keeping the gameplay same.
3223	1	a	my life &lt;3 
3225	1	a	The oldest game I have, and its great. I played a bit of it recently, and the maps have certainly changed (since I went looking for maps om used to in CS:GO, which are Inferno and Dust II). So I do recommend this game, but if you want better, get either CS:GO, OR the CS Complete Pack.
3227	1	a	Better than CS:GO for sure
3229	1	a	I only played a little, but it was fun.
3231	1	a	very cool game!
3233	1	a	full skills this game ;D
3235	1	a	Best action game
3237	1	a	Probably the best game ever. Flawless.
3239	1	a	anyway is better than go
3241	1	a	the king is here
3243	1	a	Virginia Tech Massacre Columbine High school massacre
3245	1	a	Not the best Game, but the popular game.
3247	1	a	I love this game
3249	1	a	If you didn't play this but play CS:GO, you probably like to pretend you did.
3251	1	a	I wish I could give a comprehensive review on this classic shooter, but I'm not allowed to play it anymore.  I have 1.6 hours played.
3253	1	a	latinos ruined it
3255	1	a	LIFE IS 1 , BUT COUTER-STRIKE IS 1.6       CS 4 EVER  
3257	1	a	The best game ever
3259	1	a	It's awesome

3275	1	a	oldskull x claassic x legendary  200000/10
3277	1	a	Possibly the best ever, this is the first part of the world-known seriies: counter strike, graphics aside this game takes full consentration and skill to be good at, not the first time i've played this game, but i just got it for my account, brings back the memories, a must buy for every fps-fan
3279	1	a	nice game for low graphic
3281	1	a	i love this game

I got banned from racist mod :( 0/100000   Out of 100000 points it got 0 points.
3303	1	a	Hole in the Fire!
3305	1	a	OMG YES!!! This is the real cs not like CS:GO wich was ruined by valvE. This is still 100000% no mod game at starting and you decide if you want mods. If you want to try Counter Strike YOU HAVE TO buy this game at first!
3307	1	a	The best game in the world ^_^
3309	1	a	It has been 2 years since i played counter-strike in my other account. I have at least 400+ hours in this game on another account as i loved it very much, As far as i know, I have CSGO now and i play that instead. I missed this game very much. I hope to get it again. This is just like the other CS games, You play as a Terrorist and Counter Terrorist. The objective of the Terrorist is to use the C4 and blow up 2 area's, Either one could do. A or B. While the Counter-Terrorist's objective is to Stop the bomb from being planted, If it is planted, They have to eliminate all Terrorist and Defuse the bomb. It takes around 5 second's or 10 to defuse, It depends if you have a defuse kit. It's a good game and i recommend it.
3311	1	a	my frend borowed account and cheat, i play alot and can i have a new acount or maybe team can look into problem and not vac ban me anymore? cs is very good game please help :)
3313	1	a	THE BEST GAME EVER!!!

3319	1	a	best game of all time
3321	1	a	Ruined my life. 10/10
3323	1	a	Love this game to be honest, great game which has its ups and downs, base of my PC gaming career, best game franchise based off of Half-Life what can i say.
3325	1	a	Better than global offensive &lt;3
3327	1	a	Played this since 2003, addictive game.
3329	1	a	  Still better than CS:GO.
3331	1	a	game of my life &lt;3 
3333	1	a	Good GAME and BEST FURIEN MOD.
3335	1	a	One of the games i've enjoyed, the original is always the best the say but i do recommend to have a look on the newer versions as well, it is a great game serie. I've played the Counter strike games and Half Life for quiet a while and i can't complain, 1+
3337	1	a	.
3339	1	a	the best competitive FPS i've ever played. long live 1.6 ...
3341	1	a	cool
3343	1	a	The best game in the world, the jipiroca is going pew pew.
3345	1	a	It's the best starting point of all gamers.
3347	1	a	Cheaters!

3361	1	a	the best game ever...
3363	1	a	You have to be pro to play it... like me
3365	1	a	After all this years playing on NS i finally bought it ! Good game worth the money. Totally recommended !
3367	1	a	How to be cs:go pro  1. Buy c-s 2. Launch it up and leave it on for 2 weeks straight 3. get over 100 hours of c-s and then brag about it on your next cs:go comp game how you played with the best pros back in the day  10/10 still best game and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s better than cs:go
3369	1	a	 Counter-Strike, in all of its versions, is just a great FPS game that anyone can enjoy. It's a great game and all, you just can't stop playing it, you can just sit and play with your friends for days without stopping from doing it. The huge weaponry options, which you can choose, the smoothness of the gameplay and sound of the game, it's just really addicting. With this game, I've met so many different people and unique friends. This game is literally G(OLD). I recommend this masterpiece to all the passionate Action &amp; F.P.S. players who are looking for a good, cheap and fun game to play with their friends. All I can say, as always: Good Luck &amp; Have Fun! &lt;3  10/10 
3371	1	a	best game in the world!

3431	1	a	Counter-Cstrike 1.6 is one of the best FPS games. You can do almost anything in it, which is pretty awesome, at least for me, when the player can modify things to his/her liking. You can choose from many modes, ex. Knife, Awp, Aim, Deathmatch, Surf, KreedZ, Zombie, CoD MW2, W3 FT and so on. You can change models/skins, try almost anything if not everything. It is a shame that so many people did not see its potential, but ofcourse, the time goes on &amp; the era changes, but no matter what, Counter-Cstrike 1.6 will always be my n1 OldSql game. Frankly speaking, I reccommend to try out this game to any FPS game lover, because I think he/she will not regret it. It is year 2o15 &amp; its community still lives, maybe with one foot in grave, but lives on. Thanks for any reader &amp; his time reading this.  Regards,  iMINDâ„¢ 
3433	1	a	The Best Online Game.........It Never gets OLD!!!!  EDIT : My Bad, Its Old Now :P
3435	1	a	Old but gold.

3439	1	a	  This community is better than the CSGO community  10/10
3441	1	a	.
3443	1	a	This game is not bad but still better than Twilight
3445	1	a	Counter-Strike is one of the most popular games in the world, and for me, one of the best games ever. It doesn't have a beautiful graphic if you compare with other games, but who cares? It's so fun when you play with your friends in a LAN. This game is awsome!
3447	1	a	The start of something magical. Nice nades, Gabe.
3449	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this Game!!!

3457	1	a	.
3459	1	a	Very disgusting graphics, can't believe this game was made in cry engine 4.
3461	1	a	shoot to kill
3463	1	a	Truely the best game ever, never gets old.
3465	1	a	For achv...
3467	1	a	A true classic! :D
3469	1	a	This is a game I've played with friends ever since I was very young, so it means a lot to me. It is the definition of classic games and fun to play with just friends where nobody is extremely good and everyone just have fun.
3471	1	a	i dont like tactical shooters but counter strike is one of the best fps games there are tons of peple playing fun mods on servers it is hard for new peple if you played call of duty or tf2 you can go in as a one man army but in this game its not like that if you go by your self you will get killed one problem i have with the game is if you die your out for the round and if your new you will get killed alot overall 9/10 great fun game but HARD
3473	1	a	Buy CS:GO instead
3475	1	a	Good memories on this game  get this game
3477	1	a	Its 1.6, the best counter strike ever made.
3479	1	a	Classic &amp; Awesome. Still too many cheaters but pay attention to play VAC Secured servers.

3497	1	a	Finally i buy that game! Awesome! :D (i`m not a VALVE`r now) &gt;:)
3499	1	a	Nice game!
3501	1	a	Get this game if you love repeatedly hearing sounds of 'Fire in the hole!', not respawning after you die and having to deal with players hundreds of times better than you when you first begin playing. If you enjoy a game of frustration with a terrible community who will look down on you for not having reflexes like a cyborg, this is the right game for you. Also, if you don't already have this game, you are a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Please either buy it or leave Steam immediately.
3503	1	a	Great.
3505	1	a	Perfect fps game
3507	1	a	My first contact with this was long time ago.... so fun !!!!!
3509	1	a	This game has really aged well.    Must have for any steam user.

3585	1	a	its a good game :p im kinda doing a challange
3587	1	a	Yes turns you into a hs God that is all 
3589	1	a	This game is THE best action shooter ever made, it's gameplay is very well balanced and you have many options and tactics to do.    Actually, if you play CS:GO, then this game is exactly the same except that the graphics are from 2000. But this does not matter. Gameplay is far more enjoyable then graphics!   And if steam was built aound this game, well, then it must be some good stuff.
3591	1	a	The BEST fps of all time and my personal favorite game of all time CS 1.3 was the first game i ever played and 1.6 was even better this is a must buy!
3593	1	a	Awesome game, kept me addicted for nearly 10years
3595	1	a	Even if it is an old game, this is AWESOME. :)
3597	1	a	This is a great game :D
3599	1	a	The classic 1.6 CS ... its just the best for me . Far better than CS source and still better than CS GO. Totally worth giving it a try. Still lots of people play this version of CS . All the community ... all the mods and free skins . all the game modes (zombie , laser , classic, prison etc) Its just the best out of all CS games
3601	1	a	Old is GOLD!!!
3603	1	a	It doesn't have amazing graphics so it drives Trash-Talking kids away from itself.   Would Callout B Site When at A To trick CTs Again. 11/10.
3605	1	a	The best game ever. !
3607	1	a	It's Counter Strike, it's a good game series.
3609	1	a	Just one thing i would like to say is that i can live without my girl friend but not without counter strike. :) ;)
3611	1	a	Deaded&lt;/3
3613	1	a	top

3633	1	a	Just great no toxic people,no trollers,no griefers no racism just a great game!
3635	1	a	This is the mother of all FPS games :D
3637	1	a	Counter-strike(1.0 - 1.6 not source) is one of the greatest esport fps games(if not the greatest) in the gaming history and is still worth buying today. Graphics doesnt matter for a good gamer, gameplay does
3639	1	a	very goo game.recomend for all people who want to pley a goo dgame,
3641	1	a	Unlike CS:GO, with getting expensive knives and later after you finally figure out how to use it you get shot by a noob. This game offer's true Russian Language Speaking Lessons, I have now learned fluent Russian and somehow learned German along the way. It works like a true Russian Language Speaking (and German) simulator should,   8/8 m8.
3643	1	a	it is still a nice game to play:D
3645	1	a	it's like cs.go but better   ...  k@pp@
3647	1	a	must have game. If you don't believe me try it for yourself!
3649	1	a	no need to review a game like this......today's dads still playing it......todays teens still playing it......todays kids has just started playing it......this game never gets old.
3651	1	a	BEST GAME OF ALL TIME &lt;3
3653	1	a	The best shooting game ever.

3663	1	a	Played first time 13 years ago and got totally hooked up, awesum game.
3665	1	a	The most intoxicating, the most classic CS ever. Best for oldschool players! ;)
3667	1	a	Wait, what is this? Counter-Strike?! Yes.. It's Counter-Strike.. the old FPS Game.. I've loved this game very much.. It's my Childhood Game.. This game doesn't have it's amazing duper 2014 graphics, but instead.. It's the gameplay we're talking about... So the Gameplay.. It's very fun but bit serious if you can ask me.. this game made me very serious at some period of time but the gameplay is still pretty fun.. and to derp around with it.. such as editing it's textures and etc.. I've seen people having troubles playing this game online because full of try-hards or any pros out there.. well there's no bots included in Counter-Strike but you can go practice at Counter-Strike Condition Zero, it has bots..  This game isn't free and you have to buy it. I'll only suggest people who really likes Old FPS or Competitive Gaming around here!~ Game on mates! I highly suggest you buy this game for the people who really likes FPS here..
3669	1	a	this game fun when i stuck in russian internet cafe in forest but now i live in glorious european i can play csgo!!!!  ( only poor chinese and russia play this, sometimes a german))

3687	1	a	1.6 was a revolutionary shooter inspired by some of the greats like Team Fortress Classic. There's a reason why Counter Strike is practically a house-hold name now, and why it's one of the most popular multiplayer games. Because it's a powerhouse of effective design and balance.

3711	1	a	Counter-Strike has changed a lot from 2000 to (present-day) 2015. Even with the release of CS:GO, Counter-Strike 1.6 still remains a favorite for me. There are still many dedicated servers with ten or more people in them. The graphics are outdated of course, especially in maps like nuke, but they still look decent on a few maps . This game is the beggining of one of the game series out there. I would give this game 8/10 and would reccomend this to any retro-style gamer! ;)
3713	1	a	The good old days.

3731	1	a	best shooter of all times
3733	1	a	A classic. That is the best way i can describe this game, but if you only played CSGO or even CSS and then you decide to go on a nostalgia trip to test the game, prepare to feel like you are in a very alien environment. The 2 hours that i tried, yes tried, to play the game were filled with learning the controls, adapt to the different recoil and aiming system in geral and then dying over and over again by the more experienced players  I recommend the game if you want to expand your gaming history horizons and give it a try, but you can expect frustration and rage. Its a piece of gaming history and it should be preserved as such, but new gamers will probably never get it.

3747	1	a	Worlds best game, sad we're not able to play this game anymore. RIP 1.6 2003~2012
3749	1	a	One of the best competitive games of all time. You really feel great while playing this game. Addicting and brutal!
3751	1	a	+ Good price + Good models + Fun + Good game for shity PC  - Toxic community zzz
3753	1	a	Best FPS game of all time 10/10
3755	1	a	If you're looking for great fps skill shooter with nice community, this game is for you
3757	1	a	The best online shooter i ever play, but after AVA :P
3759	1	a	Best FPS out there, no doubt. With so many different mods, maps and time it takes to get bored with this game, I just can't think of a better FPS game. Best of all, it's all fun usually - except when you get kicked from a lithuanian/polish server for speaking english or asking to ban a wallhacker.  9/10  ...because server list is so big and many of the servers are full of bots, only serving purpose to redirect players to join someone elses server. It can be hard to find a real server.
3761	1	a	worst game ever rip off of call of duty and has really crappy graphics and weres batman in the game like seriously screw all yall people who played this game 0/10 WILL NOT RECOMMEND
3763	1	a	+1

3799	1	a	I really love this game,it is fantastic :)
3801	1	a	Counter-Strike makes you work to enjoy the content, and you'll have to put many hours of play into it before enjoying the feeling of conquering it.  Weapons are a huge part of the series too, with CS:GO not an exception. Each round provides a cash sum based on your previous performance, and with this you can purchase armour, projectiles and weapons. Firearms range from standard assault rifles to shotguns and sniper rifles, and you'll want to experiment with each one to see which works best.  What makes Counter-Strike such a popular series - and what will no doubt make CS:GO the next big PC shooter - is the thrill of the ego chase. As you die, often continuously, the frustration is outweighed by an aspiration to do better. In a game where success is pinned on attention to detail, death often triggers an internal failure analysis that the player will mull over while waiting for a new session to load. It becomes a spiral of egging yourself on to do better - and if you become a good player, the game becomes a stage for you to parade your skills.  Global Offensive builds on the CS series by going through a significant checklist presented by its community and marking off as many points as possible. Gun game as its own separate mode? Check. Competitive capabilities built in? Check. Map balancing here and there? Check, check, check.  As a result, there are numerous upgrades that will adjust gameplay while also making accessibility far better. The wide range of grenades, for example, will likely make play more tactical - laying down incendiary grenades will thwart rushes, while decoys, which fake gunfire and fool radar points, are brilliant tools for messing with the minds of established players.  The actual core shooting will be a huge talking point for many months to come. It has been tinkered slightly and gives weapons a noticeably floaty feel, which doesn't sit well to begin with. We eventually found ourselves enamoured by it, and the impact of hits add a real tactile distinction to play.  It's what doesn't work, however, that is most notable. Regular mode has no new maps added to it, while all the new guns seem somewhat cosmetic. Global Offensive has also removed some of its middling weapons such as the MP5, essentially pushing even more players to stick with the AK and the M4. Sometimes it gives the impression that there is in fact less valuable content than in previous CS releases.  If one assumed this was Counter-Strike Source with a visual mod installed, there would often be little to shake that impression.  There's also now a split between casual and competitive servers - however, many players aren't yet aware of the differences, mainly because the distinction isn't made obvious enough. It becomes even more confusing if you join a community server with all hosts of mods installed on it, which have perhaps taken casual mode, turned friendly fire on and essentially made it as close to Source as possible.  At times, arranging games in Competitive Mode feels like a chore. Joining a five-on-five war is simple enough, but attempt to lobby up with a group of friends and join a game, and you'll often hit a snag. Myself and a few others tried to find a competitive game with no luck, simply being told that no servers were currently available.  When you finally do join, it works fine, but the wait and work required to find a game seems like a drawback. We eventually gave up and resorted to using IRC to find matches, as we would with Source.  Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is not the key evolution point that we were hoping for, and the response from the community often reflects this view. On many occasions, other players used phrases such as 'same old' to us.  This is elementally Counter-Strike Source with some fine-tuning under the bonnet, and Valve appears to have acknowledged this with the reasonable RRP attached to it.  And yet the core DNA of the game has not lost its appeal. This is still a glorious experience that sets a benchmark for all multiplayer shooters. Valve's objective with Global Offensive was to draw together the active communities of both the Source and trusty 1.6 edition. It clearly has a good chance.
3803	1	a	Old but Gold.

3829	1	a	Best shooter ever
3831	1	a	Very fun game, It's a classic and the only reason I use steam in the first place. If you're a fan of the series pick this up now.
3833	1	a	After 14 years still a great game. Forget the console games computer rules....
3835	1	a	old but â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥

3849	1	a	Old good thing. Enough said!
3851	1	a	The Best
3853	1	a	This game.. ohh, it's a legend. 16/10
3855	1	a	.
3857	1	a	Game for all times :D

3861	1	a	WOW, this game, man. This freakin game!!! It's amazing! Valve made a good choice hiring the guys who made this. Praise Lord Gaben!
3863	1	a	FIRE IN THE HOLE
3865	1	a	What an amazing game! I would recommend it to anyone.

3879	1	a	Definitely fun if you take the time to practice and get good at the game, takes a lot of skill and time!
3881	1	a	I may not be good at this game but I consider this the perfect FPS.

3885	1	a	11/10 game took my life, would let it take life again
3887	1	a	i want to go home

3899	1	a	Still the best
3901	1	a	best cs?
3903	1	a	GabeN be praised for this product.
3905	1	a	This is the beggining of what we call 'modern FPS'. This game is pure skill. If u are a CoD 'aim down the sight' fanboy, don't try it, you're wasting your time. This game is for skilled players only. No aim. No help. Just your and your target.
3907	1	a	getting 6-7 FPS .....lagging like hell....-_-....steam sucks......ma config is 1 gb ram , cor 2 deo, 1 gb graphic card
3909	1	a	Brought game. Learned to speak Russian in a week (9.5/10)
3911	1	a	good game, played this since 03 &lt;3
3913	1	a	yoyo best game ever
3915	1	a	Computer doesn't meet requirements, and Valve won't give me refund.
3917	1	a	This game is very nice.
3919	1	a	*joins a random half-full server *hears a bunch of foreigners yelling into their â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ mics *leaves server  10/10 would try and find an English player again.
3921	1	a	This old cs. Also like to play some times
3923	1	a	It's a great action game , my early playing game. I like the action, the maps but I don't like sometimes becase all players are buying AWP and then the game is so boring. If I were the programmer of this game I allowed only AWP on the team. Another thing is that in game must be a leader , to focus the action of all team.
3925	1	a	A little better than Pac-Man.
3927	1	a	10/10
3929	1	a	Decent game with low price!
3931	1	a	Even with the small amount of hours that i have i find the game fun, the only reason i have a small amount of hours is because i spend all of my time playing csgo.  10/10
3933	1	a	Highly recommended! LEGEND!
3935	1	a	this my beast game &lt;3
3937	1	a	Just great
3939	1	a	I cant aim in this
3941	1	a	Recommend this game to everyone, go buy this game.
3943	1	a	This game is so (1) it makes me want to cry. It's a (2) piece of (3) and it should be (4) as a (5). If you want to have a (6) and (7) time, you can go ahead and get this (8) piece of (9). Thus ends my conclusion of this (10) and (11) pile of (12).         1.Awesome 2.Absolutely Fantastic 3.Fun 4.recognized 5.Message from the heavens 6.great 7. happy 8.amazing 9.excellence 10.fabulous 11.fantastically awesome 12.goodness
3945	1	a	Great game, been playing since '04. All the community servers are trash, though.
3947	1	a	I bought a gun, killed some terrorists while spamming 'Fire in the Hole' and 'Cover me', and defused a bomb somewhere.  When I got home (after 10 years of service) , I played some Counter Strike.  Good game.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Please rate this up. I am poor and I need to buy more guns.
3949	1	a	good old times!
3951	1	a	pros:  no skins no russians cons: c4 exploits everywhere ak47 is op
3953	1	a	  Guys, help me, i can't uninstall it, it's so hard to unins, i'm so confused
3955	1	a	Awesome game spent more than 2000 hours totally
3957	1	a	A good game that will probably never die out
3959	1	a	100,000,000,000 Times better than csgo, cancer is almost non existant in this game, everyone is friendly, if ESEA, ESL or CEVO still had a pug / scrim service for this I would uninstall cancer strike : p90 offensive in a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing heartbeat and play some proper counter strike!
3961	1	a	like cs:go, but worse graphics
3963	1	a	I could find more honour in fighting an enraged bear whilst simultaneously eating the â™¥â™¥â™¥ of my cheating ex. Buying bullets was a good idea 15 years ago, why are you still playing this game? Go get shot in real life and die if you enjoy thinking you're that hardcore. - my review in the style of the baiting you will learn to love when you play this game.
3965	1	a	Very good game ! Best of csgo
3967	1	a	  .
3969	1	a	+rep me please
3971	1	a	Fun and remerberable game what has the classic feeling of Half Life. Fun since start and worth all money. Some 'bugs' in the audio but i'll deal with it. I recomend to people who likes classic FPS games. 9/10 cause setting are not so optimiseable. 
3973	1	a	my bread and butter
3975	1	a	Best online multiplayer competitive game ever made. A game with such masterful dynamics where both brilliant individual skill and team strategic ingenuity play equally important role in the final goal of triumph. Perfect in all aspects. Definitely won't get a decent successor in near future.
3977	1	a	  ....
3979	1	a	THIS GAME ROCKS!! THIS GAME SHOWS THAT WE DO NOT NEED EXTREAME GRAPHICS TO MAKE A GOOD GAME!! 1000+ hours and still having fun!! recommended 100%!!
3981	1	a	Man this game is my favorite since this really is a classic and it really doesnt need a beefy computer to play and theres still people playing it today!
3983	1	a	she thicc
3985	1	a	even my mom plays this game
3987	1	a	cs is (still) ok
3989	1	a	Good classic game, its fun to play.
3991	1	a	One of the best FPS shooters, that combine both playbility and realistic close combat action. Recommended for all that want to experience most iconic title :)
3993	1	a	cool
3995	1	a	Also recommend this game, this is the type of FPS. There are a lot of servers online, where you can have fun, and feel like a Zombie or jump on deathrun. I would recommend the game 11/10!
3997	1	a	.
3999	1	a	Its been 7 years i still play this game. I dont know why but i attracted towards gaming because of counter-strike 1.6. This game gave us many great moments in cs history. I know people nowadays play cs go but they should know 1.6 is father of cs go. PURE OLD IS GOLD !
4001	1	a	Where has the time gone wish people still played this game like they always had .
4003	1	a	A classic. Fps history right here.
4005	1	a	yes great game
4007	1	a	I recommend it!!! I like to play this game 10/10 :D
4009	1	a	As i got PC... I dont remember any other game that was so easy to just 'click &amp; play' :)
4011	1	a	:3
4013	1	a	I recommend it. Because of the skins. They are awesome.
4015	1	a	Counter strike: Source is better... but I like the cover for this one better.....
4017	1	a	Very good classic Counter Strike. Much better then CS:GO!
4019	1	a	u play a elite strike force dat works 4 a big crorporation  you'r employees r goin on strike due 2 pay bein not enough and hard work and 2 long to work... they r srsly â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ of and they want da game to be fair for them cos its not fair to work in this way...  but this is whe're you come in.... u are gonna teach them a lesson about cporpate politics LOL that means u r going to shot them  it is very reaistic u get to shot the m15 gun and the ak57 and ur characters use different cloths so u can tell which ones your meant to shoot
4021	1	a	Precision FPS. You are rarely rewarded for spraying your weapon, its all about controlled firing for headshots; somthing that is unique to this release.
4023	1	a	best game on the worlds
4025	1	a	This MMORPG is off the chain! The story line is really intriguing and the in-game NPCs are just a delight! 2 thumbs WAY up ur butt
4027	1	a	if you like old shooters then this game is for you 
4029	1	a	Bhop
4031	1	a	Was a pleasure ... while it lasted.
4033	1	a	My precious ;P
4035	1	a	Best game tbh :)
4037	1	a	Unlike other FPS's from 1999 this one still has servers.
4039	1	a	Mouse Facing Glitch ~ 10/10
4041	1	a	Since 8 years ago this game stays no. 1
4043	1	a	8/8 Would do random headshots with the Galil again
4045	1	a	number one
4047	1	a	Who needs new call of duty or battlefield, when we got this? 'The Legend' 10/10
4049	1	a	Ruined my life, 5 stars.
4051	1	a	The sniper scope looks exactly what it looks like in real life
4053	1	a	Best shooter :-)
4055	1	a	Best FPS game in 2000, still is today. Better than COD. 11/10
4057	1	a	I love this game. That was the first game where i was start and i love it forever &lt;3
4059	1	a	This will serve as a recommendation to all games in the CS series. THEY ARE ALL BETTER THAN CALL OF DUTY. JUST GO GET IT!
4061	1	a	Nice game, try it!
4063	1	a	cs is love cs is life &lt;3
4065	1	a	:)
4067	1	a	Still the best game out there
4069	1	a	Very nice game.
4071	1	a	Very good game!
4073	1	a	why i cant config video. Now more large.
4075	1	a	10/10. This is where real skill comes from.
4077	1	a	Old game but still one of the best :)
4079	1	a	I recomend this game for bad PC-s. 
4081	1	a	CS FOREVER :)
4083	1	a	Great Game
4085	1	a	:)
4087	1	a	Finds new friends and learns something
4089	1	a	The Best Multiplayer game ever!
4091	1	a	Old but good
4093	1	a	Back to sources... Souvenirs
4095	1	a	I love this very old shooter game. This game is amazing for its crazy graphics and how it plays. Amazing game in general.
4097	1	a	the best
4099	1	a	Best shooter of all time. It is old but so much people are still playing it. You need skill and good reflexes... and do not camp or snipe... because I will knive a n00b!
4101	1	a	game of the century ;3
4103	1	a	Nice game
4105	1	a	Im still doing my config.
4107	1	a	I remember when i played this game in2005 it was so cool at this time but now..

4111	1	a	Graphics gave me cancer  11/10 ign
4113	1	a	Despite my hilariously low count of, 0.6 hours, on record, I can attest to you that, nay, I have played this game(and it's 'sequels') to the ends of time. I've literally sunk close to 15,000 hours into the various derivations of CS over the years.  I found out about CS from some #IRC chat I used to frequent back in the day(it might have been an ICQ chat with one of them). Namely, I started with the first ALPHA(yea, not beta, ALPHA). I can recall the loading screen and everything. From there, I progressed through the initial betas, introduction of maps, and various weapons(anyone remember the OLD cs_siege, complete with working apc and sniper tower?), etc.  I then became a player in various 'leagues'; I won't name drop, but I was a baller at one time.  So, yes, this game is good. Some people recommend CSGO as the 'modern' return of 1.6, but I disagree. CSGO is better than CSS, yes, but still not on-par with 1.6, nothing will ever be :(  Goodbye WON-servers.
4115	1	a	highly recommended to live no life
4117	1	a	A classic game, still good and played to this day, though I'm not pro enough to use the AWP
4119	1	a	Old-school as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, best game if you are good at shooting games.
4121	1	a	10 years and still playing , 1.6 will never die.
4123	1	a	The best of the best....
4125	1	a	Classic game &lt;3, My first fps game :D
4127	1	a	11/10 BEST GAME

4135	1	a	
4137	1	a	If you dont own it your missing out.
4139	1	a	This game is just a classic. If you think you are a gamer you should know
4141	1	a	No bots if you suck at online or have crappy wifi connection tho
4143	1	a	I Recommend This Game.
4145	1	a	the best game ever made!
4147	1	a	  123
4149	1	a	9/10
4151	1	a	There is only one thing I would like to know about this game. Why is there an Auto-aim option in the mouse section of options. I have never tried it and I don't know if it works but I just think it is strange.
4153	1	a	No bots. Sad. :&lt;
4155	1	a	Best game of all time :)
4157	1	a	Nice game :P
4159	1	a	If you dont take into account that this game is 14 years old... IT IS AWESOME!
4161	1	a	classic game. everybody should have played it atleat one time.
4163	1	a	I died... alot 4.8/10 to much water

4167	1	a	I love counter-strike 1.6
4169	1	a	OldSchool Good Game ;)
4171	1	a	Like it, in my opinium the best CS, now i can play it cause they fixed the hacked masterserver.
4173	1	a	Very good game :) Recommended.
4175	1	a	Incredible for a game released in 2000. Being the first Counter Strike game, it contains items, physics, sections that can't be found in CS:GO. This game is what paved the way to my personal favorite CS:GO. I would really recommend this game to see what it felt like in the early 2000s.
4177	1	a	10/10
4179	1	a	Life is 1.  CS is 1.6   :)
4181	1	a	My childhood game, a very nice game, with good graphics that I enjoy playing even today when Source and GO is out. Very good.
4183	1	a	~.~
4185	1	a	awesome sauce 
4187	1	a	Played this as a kid (lol) probably the best game ever made, and the best thing is - no cases no skins no ranks - skill is the only thing that separates you from the general mass
4189	1	a	The source of cs gamess :D  +rep
4191	1	a	Not Just a game but my LIFE playing since 2010 and it was worth buying my favorite game ever 11/10
4193	1	a	Probably the best game in the world.
4195	1	a	#Old But Gold  #Best Shooter Ever

4207	1	a	CSGO on cocaine
4209	1	a	CS
4211	1	a	i love the game just one question, why did valve change the old models? heres the problem the guys hand model in the beta is fine but the steam 1.6 version his skin is to pale to be skin. the old player models were fine but in 1.6 they are just blah. the old title screen it looked fine in the beta it always reminded me of the map de_dust but 1.6 it reminds me of like a news report thing about to come on TV. the hostages sure they look better with the bland orange suits and the white suits with ties, but the scientist models for the hostages look better because for example would you see a guy in a orange suit in a freezing cold place like office? alright i think i am done with saying all the problems with cs 1.6 now
4213	1	a	Classic.
4215	1	a	If you like shooting that is not just all run and gun and take a little thinking, then this is the game for you.
4217	1	a	:3
4219	1	a	+++
4221	1	a	This game is the best 10/10
4223	1	a	Well...... I started playing this game about 9 years ago, now I'm 16, but this game is still one of my favourites. I really enjoy playing this game with my good friends. In this 9 years, we had a good time. It has been a legend to our generation.
4225	1	a	Classic:D
4227	1	a	The original Counter-Strike, Valve made a multiplayer masterpiece here; it is almost faultless, apart from its old graphics.  14/15 - 'Good'
4229	1	a	Classic great game, if you have not played it you should!
4231	1	a	Oh...it's only the best team based first person shooter of all time.
4233	1	a	Hell yeah!!
4235	1	a	This is a good game i recommended to you. This game is old bath a good game for nolifers. If you play this i recommend a server Ladie.lt this is a good server. This server is of Lithuianian country.
4237	1	a	this game is pretty cool
4239	1	a	Very Classic Game In The CS Community i really do recommend it love it!
4241	1	a	just a good first person shooter. nothing great but for its time its good
4243	1	a	This game is the best game ever
4245	1	a	Best Game Ive Ever Purchased!
4247	1	a	 The unlikely mod that changed gaming forever.
4249	1	a	+This game still have appeal  - Runs slightly higher cpu then TF2 does (Edit: V-sync on can reduce load by half)
4251	1	a	Fired at a person and I actually killed them  10/10, already more polished than CSGO
4253	1	a	CS 1.6 FOREVER
4255	1	a	does anyone knows this game? ^^
4257	1	a	still better than cod
4259	1	a	10 years of pure fun &lt;3 10/10
4261	1	a	This is where the best FPS franchise started!
4263	1	a	WOW THIS GAME IS LIKE CSGO BUT WITH BAD GRAPHICS WTF IT EVEN HAS DUST2!!!1!!!11!11!!1!
4265	1	a	i love the cs series and valve game in general so i would definetly recommend all of the counter strike series
4267	1	a	the classic. the feels.
4269	1	a	I get my â™¥â™¥â™¥ wooped by people who have been playing since electricity was discovered.
4271	1	a	nice game but needs a workshop.
4273	1	a	The best game ever!!&lt;3
4275	1	a	3742 hours of gameplay. What else i can say about this game :D
4277	1	a	always will be the best game ever
4279	1	a	In my opinion, I prefer this one over CS:Source. Not that CS:Source is bad or anything, it's just the newest update that ruined it. PS Teamwork is highly recommended. Also! Don't forget to get this and CS:Condition Zero (Which comes with this and it's only $10 for 2 games in one ^_^
4281	1	a	luv thr gmae v bu t hsvaer wrto get hacks hehehehz
4283	1	a	my fav. game.  i haven't got bored playing this game and also became a skilled player :).

4301	1	a	Best game of all time.
4303	1	a	Servers are too far fps and are not :'( 
4305	1	a	That one game where a bullet can pass through a 2 foot thick concrete wall and a 5 foot long crate, and the assault rifles have 12 random recoil patterns each.
4307	1	a	Although it has poor animations and graphics, it is still one of the most played games, and it's still running. This game is created to test out players reflexes. With great skills, comes great VICTORIES.  Put your skills to the test with this Counter Strike, one of the best first player shooting game ever released, with more than 1000 of servers online 24/7.
4309	1	a	got arrested at the air port because my headphones came out and everyone around me heard â€œthe bomb has been planted.â€  10/10 would get arrested again

4321	1	a	Best game ever made. Too bad volvo decided to destroy it and force us to play the pointless cs:go. Seriously, why not both? Why removing all the support and updates from the best fps game ever made?
4323	1	a	-SUPER FUN -old but gold -broken  -super smooth -XD
4325	1	a	Cs 1.6 was the game before css and csgo I enjoyed it really much back then still loving it but i'm playing csgo now

4329	1	a	Geforce is still supporting this game
4331	1	a	Nothing beats a classic.
4333	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ nuggets. try to shift walk - join new server try to crouch - join new server
4335	1	a	If you like counter strike source but hate the gun physics, try this game. Still a bunch of people playing after all these years
4337	1	a	Cs 1.6 was the game before css and csgo I enjoyed it really much back then still loving it but i'm playing csgo now

4369	1	a	The Best for ever
4371	1	a	Counter-Strike:  I started playing cs when I was just 4 years old .  Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT.  CS is one of the greatest and undermined games in history. It is, in my opinion, the best game to ever have a crosshair. 'Very Addictive Game :p
4373	1	a	sick game.
4375	1	a	best of best
4377	1	a	  Its not just a Game.......................... 
4379	1	a	swelll team based fps
4381	1	a	10/10
4383	1	a	If you're a die hard CS fan you need to play the game that started it all. CS 1.6 was such a good game from the start and only got better. This game started so many things for eSports that many cannot truly appreciate.
4385	1	a	Waiting for Half-Life 4 -.-
4387	1	a	It's not the hours of games that the player ! : p  My first FPS of 2004..... I gets it wrong with this new account! Best game !! 20/20
4389	1	a	OMG RUSSIA IS BAD DONT SAY BAD BECAUSE IM BAD BOY FOR CS 1.6 AND PRO PLAYER DONT HATE DONT INJURE IM DONT KNOW IM SAYING
4391	1	a	This is old games and many people play this games, many india player beacause the india play CS1.6 crack server
4393	1	a	Probably the best cs game ever  Buy it already plebs
4395	1	a	COOOL
4397	1	a	After 6 years of playing it in cracked versions from torrent, I finally bought it
4399	1	a	counter-strike is a good game for the most part, adding characters and stuff to the half life franchise and universe... there are several canon discrepencies, but they can be ignored for the gameplay and overall storyline (and even how that fits into the orignal half life game :D)  overall its worth paying for and playing...
4401	1	a	The Best Game 4 Ever Nice Fps Nice Gameplay  :D
4403	1	a	Full of cheaters, don't buy this game.

Taking back sunday? Thursday? Pffftt this is way more garbage tier than that.

4479	1	a	The best Game ever. Buy this legendary game and play the world's number 1 online action game. Engage in an incredibly realistic brand of terrorist warfare in this wildly popular team-based game. Ally with teammates to complete strategic missions. Take out enemy sites. Rescue hostages. Your role affects your team's success. Your team's success affects your role. Dont think twice BUY IT . You will not regread.

4485	1	a	This is the only Counter-Strike game worth mentioning. 10/10 always and forever.
4487	1	a	It might look like a tiny Half Life mod, but look closer and you'll see that It's got a lot you can learn. Takes time to be skilled at this game. Really fun to co-operate with your friends. Please, if you're a CS:GO player, try this game out!

4521	1	a	Counter-Strike is a game that I recommend because: - is one of the legends from the category shooting - is cheaper than the rest from the category shooting - is a method to banish boredom  - is a good method to increase your performance at aim - you can easy change the type of default skins by the skins from internet - have a fair VAC staff - and... why you don't try?  Enjoy!

4567	1	a	  cool classic game :D i like this
4569	1	a	The game that singlehandedly started the FPS genre on the PC - and we're not talking about CoD. That's a different mess. Especially around BlackOps3.   What more do I need to say?
4571	1	a	Old School Game One Of The That Make My Childhood Happy 10/10
4573	1	a	Â¡Good game!, one of my favorite VALVE games.
4575	1	a	'Worst game ever, worst graphics' The graphics are that bad because the game is older than your mothers fanny and the game is awesome itself. Brings all the good memories back. For example when I was 7, installing the cracked version of that game and then just shooting anyone who gets in my way without controlling the recoil. (â•¯Â°â–¡Â°ï¼‰â•¯ï¸µ â”»â”â”» and lol traded this game for some crappy AK-47 in CS GO. Huehuehuehuehue. I give it 8/8 m8. pls liek no hate no homo tenks. Oh and btw the funniest thing about this game is brining your CS GO skills there, doing 1 hit kills and then getting banned from servers for 'hacking' Like I've joined a sever once, done 7 headshots in a row without dying, then some speccy â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ is sayin': 'wh and aim off or im banning you.' So yea this game is fabulous 8/8 would rate again.
4577	1	a	Get this game is beastz
4579	1	a	Good game when it game out. Super Toxic now
4581	1	a	this game is like 10 dollars get it

4587	1	a	good game for play 
4589	1	a	Counter-Strike is a first-person shooter game in which players join either the terrorist team, the counter-terrorist team, or become spectators. Each team attempts to complete their mission objective and/or eliminate the opposing team. Each round starts with the two teams spawning simultaneously.  The objectives vary depending on the type of map, and these are the most usual ones:  Bomb defusal: The terrorists must carry a bomb, plant it on one of the designated spots and protect it from being disarmed by the counter-terrorists before it explodes to win. The counter-terrorists win if the time runs out with no conclusion. Hostage rescue: The counter-terrorists must rescue a group of hostages held by the terrorists to win. The terrorists win if the time runs out with no conclusion. VIP escort: One of the counter-terrorists is chosen to act as a VIP and the team must escort this player to a designated spot on the map to win the game. The terrorists win if the VIP is killed or if the time runs out with no conclusion. A player can choose to play as one of eight different default character models (four for each side, although Counter-Strike: Condition Zero added two extra models, bringing the total to ten). Players are generally given a few seconds before the round begins (known as 'freeze time') to prepare and buy equipment, during which they cannot attack or move. They can return to the buy area within a set amount of time to buy more equipment (some custom maps included neutral 'buy zones' that could be used by both teams). Once the round has ended, surviving players retain their equipment for use in the next round; players who were killed begin the next round with the basic default starting equipment.  Standard monetary bonuses are awarded for winning a round, losing a round, killing an enemy, being the first to instruct a hostage to follow, rescuing a hostage, planting the bomb (Terrorist) or defusing the bomb (Counter-Terrorist).  The scoreboard displays team scores in addition to statistics for each player: name, kills, deaths, and ping (in milliseconds). The scoreboard also indicates whether a player is dead, carrying the bomb (on bomb maps), or is the VIP (on assassination maps), although information on players on the opposing team is hidden from a player until his/her death, as this information can be important.  Killed players become 'spectators' for the duration of the round; they cannot change their names before their next spawn, text chat cannot be sent to or received from live players, and voice chat can only be received from live players and not sent to them. Spectators are generally able to watch the rest of the round from multiple selectable views, although some servers disable some of these views to prevent dead players from relaying information about living players to their teammates through alternative media (most notably voice in the case of Internet cafes and Voice over IP programs such as TeamSpeak or Ventrilo). This form of cheating is known as 'ghosting.'
4591	1	a	old school
4593	1	a	the nostalgia is real 11/10 
4595	1	a	This game is basically just CoD with bad graphics. I rate it 10/10
4597	1	a	Still great game I hope CS will live on forever :D 
4599	1	a	One of the best childhood games i have ever played! 10/10 !
4601	1	a	For those who, put negative reviews, well not for those but for all of them, you write negative review just because game lags, it's only your problem, much of the people has no problems with this game, this game can be ran easily on potato pc, same if you got a VAC ban that's your problem, that's your problem if you're stupid and can't play legitimately, many cheaters in your opinion?? Find another server don't sit on one server, or go to Steam-only server. People play this game only for fun, there are no ranks(not talking about server's specific ranks), that's the most important thing. Of course teamgame on this mostly dissapeared, people play only by theirselves, but that's good, you know why? You will never get nervous if your teammate fails to defuse the bomb or something like that, because you play by yourself. Talking about game modes, oh God there are so much modes, starting from Surf ending with Zombie Plague. You can play this with your friends easily, cause there are no rank restrictions. The ban system and other things like amx_ban or amx_kick are highly fixed and upgraded at maximum. You can put whatever skins you want from CS:GO and so on, and use it without any restrictions. This old - school game is being massively played for 16 years now and i think that after 10 years he's going to be played still.  Highly recommended!
4603	1	a	The graphics might be bad, but who cares? People said that Wind Waker was bad only for the graphics, but once you played it, it was AWESOME. Same with this game, the graphics might be bad, but what do you expect from a game that was amde in 2000? But once you play this, it's really fun.
4605	1	a	I recommend any CS game
4607	1	a	A classic and always will be! must get for classic game lovers!
4609	1	a	Best FPS for Valve. I love this game. You should really buy this epic game and its franchise.
4611	1	a	Its okay, i guess.

4621	1	a	A classic and always will be! must get for classic game lovers!
4623	1	a	The games dead. Its basically worthless to anyone in USA unless you want to play with third worlders. Even then theres only a few servers it looks like. I would rather die than play with South Americans. Anything south of the US border is just hell ( I have never had a positive experience online with these people and if you know anything about geopolitics I need not go into that), so I advise not dealing with these peoples idiocy and just going with CSGO these days unless you want to LAN this game.  One of the greatest FPS games to ever come out and will forever remain a classic but also a game that can still compete design and gameplay wise with games released in more current times. We will never have the natural form of support from players and ESPORTS ever again. This is before ESports was just a way for devs to market and shill a game. This was from when people who liked to play a game competed and not just a bunch of rich kids trying to win monetary prizes like ESports is now (who else could play CSGO all day erry day in this economy?)  People got behind this game because they liked it, instead CSGO is all about market manipulation and human psychology manipulating with less consideration about gameplay because they want the most monetary return. If the idiots will pay hundreds for a digital knife skin then why would any company invest in gameplay that won't have direct returns like a digital nongood would have?  The video game market is full of idiots who will dump money into anything now just so they can distract themselves from the politcs, economics, and slowly declining living conditions of the western world. Bread and circus in its truest form.  CS 1.6 is from better days, more honest days. When people who wanted to make games, and people who wanted to play games were very closely related and the average IQ of someone who was online was higher than now. These days every idiot has an internet connection. That is to say, the target audience then was just better than the target audiences of todays games. This is exampled many times in economics. Mediocricity Sells.
4625	1	a	i love this game :)

4633	1	a	Just One of The Best Games Out there  â˜†Well its just one the best classics   â˜† One of The Steam Golden Titles  â˜†Has a really Great Community  â˜† If Ur a Cs Go fan then why dont u still own it    ................... OLD IS GOLD.....................
17	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥ off I can't get refund
4635	1	a	It's the original CS on Steam! You just can't go wrong with this one.
18	0	a	My negative vote is for this Steam version only. CS 1.6 is a great game but for some reason valve removed bots and the main menu music in this version so I can't recommend getting this version.
19	0	a	I remember playing this game on WON. This was one of the best games on the market until GO came out. I've wasted so much time playing this game and I regret every second of it. Waste of time and it'll turn you into a homeless nerd with no friends.
4637	1	a	Great. Simply Great.
20	0	a	2 Thumbs up!!!
21	0	a	It's â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.

4639	1	a	CS 1.6 the best game of all times !!!
23	0	a	CLIENT MODEL WORLD IS NULL !!!  wtf is going on, i have vertyfied the game, and went into the folders and deleted all the things in cs-download, and it still dosent work !!
24	0	a	I can't think of a single reason why someone would install this today. Used to be famous but is now archaic and empty. Those servers that do exist are full of non-English speaking hackers.
4641	1	a	just buy this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ masterpiece and love every second of it.
25	0	a	Only â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing brazilians play this game.
26	0	a	I like old games, I mean, i grew up playing the Lands Of lore RPG's. This game was awesome when it came out for its time..but i like to move on with the times and experience newer, better games. I want to push my rig, and going back to a game from 2000, wont be doing much for me. I can understand why alot of people have trouble letting go of the past, and playing all the games they did when PC gaming started to become more relivent, but common, there are so many better looking, newer games out there that people dont give a chance. Even CSGO needs a buff,graphically and mechanically but thats just me.
4643	1	a	When-ever I want to have a break off counter strike : Global offensive, I play this game! ^_^
4645	1	a	My old school tactical fps.Its still have a classic atmosfere and gameplay.My best game from 90s.
4647	1	a	;]
27	0	a	hello....not good, maybe anyone can help me, i cant play counter strike, every time i connect to some server, sometimes it allowed me to play but sometime not, its connectic to other servers all the time, like reconnecting....showing that loading bar...precaching items or something like that....very sad i both this game only yesterday, one more thing...tried to purchase a gift for my friend...they took my money, but didnt gave my friend a gift, nothing.....
4649	1	a	hory shet
4651	1	a	Classic....
4653	1	a	Legendary! Counter Strike 1.6 - as it should be.  The game has stood the test of time, an yet still out does Counter Strike Source, as one of the most remembered, well designed, fun multiplayer shooters of the last decade.  9/10
4655	1	a	Best game ever, good old times :)
4657	1	a	Howdy partners, y all â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s need to grow da â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ up and play some GO.
4659	1	a	One of the best FPS game.
28	0	a	you cant add the bot to your game so basicly it's kind of pointless to play the game
29	0	a	people said it was the best cs of all time so i figured i would pick it up. when i got into my first game, i had problems looking around... this didnt stop. im stuck sometimes looking at the ground and as much as i move my mouse im still looking at the ground. sometimes im looking at a wall, and i move my mouse as much as i can. but the mouse keeps going right back to the same place on the screen. please help, i cant play until this problem is fixed.
30	0	a	This game is crap
4661	1	a	Obsolete ever since blaah, gaah, etc. became impossible to find. Used to spend hours on this, not anymore though.
4663	1	a	Well this is my childhood game.When I was like 5 my dad instaled me the multiplayer one. It was nice but I didnt get a kill so I closed it and never open it again until now. :3
4665	1	a	I shoot bullets at a person, and they die from it.  Sometimes they do not.  Sometimes they shoot me.  Very deep storytelling.
4667	1	a	I dont own this one either.
34	0	a	incredibly hard to get a vac ban
35	0	a	DON'T FALL FOR NOSTALGIA BIAS  Pros: -classic feel  -people still play it(barely) -no skins(almost)  Cons: -80% of the players are hackers and do not speak english(so no real teamwork) -real servers with the gamemode actually being a CS type are almost non-existant -actual enjoyability comes from whether or not you like to deal with the above  This is one of gamings most treasered games and it is sad to see it get like this. Nostalgia can only get people so far and it is a shame thaat few people explain the reality of this game in their reviews. The fun is not totally gone, although it is something you have to really try to find. The gameplay is as you would expect it (at least when you find a server that doesn't have CSGO surfers on it), nothing has changed and thats good. The problem is the community. It is hard to find a server with a team you can communicate with because of the major language barrier the game now has.  Communication is key in this game as you would expect, and it is very rare because almost everytime you get on a server it is from a central american area and the players mostly speak spanish. Making it difficult as you would expect.   The amount of hacking in this game shameful, it is more common than it is in CSGO and is a real problem that makes the experience more bad than it already has become.  The server types are just like what you would see in an old game, modded to hell with new terribly unenjoyable game modes. If you were to see you would find many gameplay modded servers that give you trash that nobody wants to see (surfing).   Take away the nostalgia bias that everyone tosses out and you will see that this game is a former shell of itself. It has all the elements of a typical old PC game that only a few people will try hard enough to enjoy. The enjoyment can still be found, but at a heavy heavy cost. RIP CS1.

4673	1	a	Old but gold !
4675	1	a	 I love Counter Strike, I should end it here. But I'll be honest and say I grew up with Source, wasn't old enough to experince 1.6 sadly. But giving it a try, it's very different, having to buy ammo, see what the original maps looked like before being changed in Source. And dealing with pros that somehow can deal with the game choppyness and inaccuracy. I'll stick with Source, but great game!  9/10
4677	1	a	Bought it at 2004 best game!
39	0	a	i have ban alot of time i whant a play
4679	1	a	Good Game but dont play if your donald trump lots of mexicans kinda unplayable cause whenever i join a server i gotta revert my controls or i get sent to another server and will do it mid game sometimes kinda annoying
4681	1	a	Many people in this game have been playing since 1999+, and certainly have the skill to prove it. This game changed the gaming industry greatly, and is of very high quality, though ages like anything but a fine wine. Only get it if you have someone you know that can teach you how to play it. Otherwise stick with CS:GO.
42	0	a	I got banned from this game in 2002 by VAC just because I logged in from a computer with hacks installed in a LAN SHOP. It has been 11 years since I was banned and I still can't play Counterstrike with my account. I am already 25 this year, even prisoners in democratic nations are given 2nd chance but not STEAM. Shameful!
43	0	a	Why the helll my server is keep changing all the time and how i can stop that?
44	0	a	NONONONONONONONOONNONOONO  WTF HAPPENS? I buy the game and i just try to play it.  List of servers: '[FREE VIP]' 20/32 users in ALL servers. When i enter the message of the day never gets out when i press 'OK'. Server disconnect and automatic send me to another server. JUST FEW servers works fine, and not so much fine.  CSS Location Folder: God.. i was searching the problem about that â†‘â†‘â†‘ and i just found a note block just says.. 'Have a nice huge d*ck up your as*!' and another folder with insult too.  WTF Valve? i gave the game to a friend to check if was just MY error but no. He also get the same '''error''' than me.  Maybe the first things i saw was just an error.. but founding a folder that was insulting me? I dont think so Valve, i can report this '''''error'''' but i didn't.  I buy this game just for enjoy my old times.. So i prefer download it pirate.  PS: I never touch any file or change something. Again, idk how Valve can do this and i don't think was a 'hacker'.

76	0	a	  This is just a s.hitty unrealistic version of Call of Duty! Don't buy this c.rappy knock off, it looks like a f.ucking Iphone game.
77	0	a	First please read the review because there are a lot of fanboys who downvote all negative ones just because you want me to think perfectly of this game!  Well first of all i wanna say i dont have much to say other than this game is amazing i have played it my entire life but not the steam version a pirated version and please dont hate me for that but the most stable version of this game is pirate version wanna know the reasons why? ok fine here they are: 1.CL_flushentitypacket error which is extremely annoying given the fact that it will lagg you out and it cant be fixed because most of the servers are against the fix and usually that fix doesnt even work. While that error occurs on pirated version too it occurs really rarely while on steam version it doesnt stop the whole damn game and it is either the server that will kick you for using that fix or VAC that will kick you if you are lucky and ban you and you arent even using the third party software!!! its a console FLIPPING COMMAND!!! 2.There are a ton of servers that have a virus that will rebind all of your keys to join their server once you join the server for the first time and honestly i dont know how will this benefit either the owner of the server or you because you cant even play the server normally you will just reconnect all over again when you try to do something and in all honesty if you do such thing on your server â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you and i hope you get cancer. But you might be thinking how is this connected to not buying this game? well simple and i have 2 reasons for that. First reason is that why do you want to spend money on a game that has this type of issue and second of all the reason why this is a biggie is that in pirated version of the game you can change your binds and it will all save but unlike the steam version the 'Synchronizing feature' will save stuff but if you change the binds it will come back because people who use this exploit can work their way around it and trust me you will encounter a lot of servers like that. But trust me i dont hate this game in fact this is the game that got me into pc gaming back in 2004 but is it worth it buying a game that doesnt benefit you in any way as a legal version? of course not but its not me thinking that this game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ in fact its evolutionary its perfect and i have spent 1000+ hours outside of steam version and i gotta say i have been getting a lot less errors and a lot less â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t messages from vac for me trying to fix this error and a lot less problems than i had with the LEGAL VERSION THAT SHOULD BE MORE OF A QUALITY THAN THE ILLEGAL VERSION!. And im not promoting piracy in fact i think its lame but this is the game that should be pirated because it doesnt offer anything good in legal version in fact it downgrades a lot but when there are 50000 people that are hidden off your charts of cs 1.6 just because they wanna play normally and pirate the game there is something seriously wrong with the legal version and i really dont recommend buying this its the same as the pirated version but with more game breaking stuff! 
78	0	a	bad game  all cheatrs

HOW CAN I PLAY THZE GAME IF I DIDNT OWN IT?!?!?!?!?!??!  â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ u steam
124	0	a	Counter-strike, my childhood! Brings bad memories back...  One of the first Valve games, and this one is a total â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. I understand why Half-life sucks so much, but how famous multiplayer trash shooter can be so badly made?! There is two teams, terrorist team and counter-terrorist team (both acts like scumbags). Your goal is to kill other team or place the bomb as terrorist. Allahu akbar! Never seen this before, bad guys can actually win. Its terrorism propaganda! Counter-strike playerbase is worst part of this, they dumb as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and hot headed of course, alot of cheaters who cant play fair, this makes this game completely unplayable and innocent people get VAC ban (like me). Valve dont want to take responsibilty, they want to have fun with their â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing Steam money and spit on us! There is only one official game mode, kill each other and take score. Pfff, we need more! Like capture the flag, zombies and singleplayer (officially) i dont know what else to say, those freaks done so little about this game.  0/10 Blood-Brain win
125	0	a	I love CS as much as the next guy. But you will have more fun with Counter strike: Source or Counter strike: Global offensive. Why do i say that you may ask? This is filled to the brim with hackers nowadays to the point where it's basically unplayable. I personally like the classic feel of CS, but Counter strike Global offensive is still fun in it's own way. Get css or csgo. You'll thank me later.
126	0	a	I thought I would receive comfy nostalgia with a small but nice community, instead I got a bunch of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥-talking mexicans 14/88 it's not like you think it would be
127	0	a	I really would like to recommend this game, it's amazing, but this game is infected with hackers. The Valve Anti-Cheat in this game has gone wrong, it would never ban a cheater but bans innocent gamers. A friend of mine got banned from this game, five years ago, and he still can't play, even the prisoners IRL have second chances, but not in a game? Really Gabe Newell?
128	0	a	still sucks after 15 years

131	0	a	Was good... Now... Now it's full of hackers, non steam players with toaster computers that cant speak basic english, and bot servers.
132	0	a	Counter Strike is even fight between highly trained American anti-terrorist team using latest in military technology to battle a group of really â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ madmen possessing crude bomb and surplus from USSR 1980's army supplies. Despite all training and technology terrorists still have good chance of blowing up market therefore much like real life.  Game is currently full of hackers who fly on top of map so unless you hack or like getting aerial teabag please play better Counter Strike Sauce or Counter Strike Go game. This game has had its day and only exists for historical purposes. I remember times when internet cafe and mosque full of this game. No more.
133	0	a	No good quality servers, and most people are hackers or get a cracked version of the game and threaten to DDOS you. Get CS:CZ, CS:S, or CS:GO because they have bots to play with if you can't even find a server. Might have been good 15 years ago but now it has been left to rot.

143	0	a	There is a huge lump in my throat as I edit this review. If you own this game and reading reviews for fun, keep scrolling. So this game is only MP without mods and its dying atleast here in my country(India) and its $10 which is way too expensive in terms of our currency. Get the physical copy of Counter-Strike Anthology from a local/online retailer which will have half the price of this game alone without any sale! RIP Counter-Strike 1.6 :(
144	0	a	havnt played it a lot but source is good
145	0	a	play to have fun â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ !!
146	0	a	If you were a fan of this game back in the day you'll feel nostalgic and want to buy it but don't, it doesn't hold up if you've done any gaming of any sort since then.
147	0	a	From this game i remember the good memories . I don't like good memories 
148	0	a	Does have some multiplayer, but all the modes are gimmicky and not fun. Not many english servers either.
149	0	a	This will always be the best counter-strike ever, but I can no longer recommend it. 90% of servers are hosted by mexicans so if you don't know spanish.....2bad... Try CS:GO or CS: source.
150	0	a	it's a great game, but i don't recommend because nowadays there is a map rotativity of just two or three maps
151	0	a	  Is Counter-Strike: Global Offensive worth to buy?
152	0	a	There is no point in playing this game. I was banned for using hacks when I have never used any hack programs on my steam account. Wasted $10 for this game. Good luck
153	0	a	it's way too â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ to play!
154	0	a	dont buy this is crap 
155	0	a	ratchet
156	0	a	when I play offline there is no bots

159	0	a	i dont know is it ebcause i didnt play it when it was first out but to me it seems â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ theres no competive mode and the graphics arent good either gameplay is good but id just get global offensive
160	0	a	i dont know is it ebcause i didnt play it when it was first out but to me it seems â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ theres no competive mode and the graphics arent good either gameplay is good but id just get global offensive

162	0	a	IT STOOPID, GET GO, 0/420
163	0	a	Not worth the nostalgia, clunky and slow. You're better off getting Counter Strike : Global Offensive
164	0	a	This game sucks for 4 reasons: 1. Its now outdated, and there are better/newer ones. 2. Its purely multiplayer, not even bots to practice. 3. Its super boring even if you play with people you know. 4. People complain if you loose. Chill, its just a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing game! Thats about it. I dont suggest this to anyone unless they want to waste their money.
165	0	a	Loved this game and i played it 7 years but now it has no scope.If you want to play, you can play for fun only~
166	0	a	16 years after it's release people are still palying it, which, in my opinion, says a lot! People are dumb as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥...
167	0	a	This version of CS is obsolete. Your game can get hacked if you join the wrong server. It happened to me. Now when I try to join any server it just sends me to a foreign server with bots.  i reformatted and reinstalled and now i can play. its not an easy thing to fix.
168	0	a	-Do you like empty servers? -Do you like a long list of empty servers? -Do you like servers with nothing but junk map after junk map and none of the originals? -Do you like boring themed gun play? -Do you like a chaos fest of 32 players on a small map? -Do you like to waste your money?   This game is for you! Once a great game, but no one plays it anymore. Which is a shame, CS:GO is trash.
169	0	a	its glitchy
170	0	a	This game is pretty much not fun anymore, if you want to play it, crack it. Its not worth 10â‚¬ anymore its just bad.
171	0	a	im love counter strike im myth counter strike 
172	0	a	because of the worst updates that valve made for this old and beautifull game i wont recommand it anymore

176	0	a	Is old
177	0	a	Only people who still play are either Spanish or former Pro's.
178	0	a	It was my favorite game, but since steam tried so much to screw this game with all that useless updates that ruied it...and it dosen't work on windows 8, plus they got out D3D the only option that you had if you have windows 8, now...its a piece of crap, if we are talking about cs 1.6 when steam gived a **** about it, then its a 10/10 but now its just a 5/10 or 4/10 RIP cs 1.6 THANKS A LOT STEAM! :(
179	0	a	dont buy it ... when u will have some error and u cant find a solution no one will help you ... i cant play for almost 1 month because error ' connection problem ' at this game only !!! and i tried everything and no thing is helping ... new steam &amp; new cs &amp; new windows &amp; new antivirus ... and no one at the steam team really care !
180	0	a	This game is old for now we have the 'Counter Strike - Global Offensive' it's really better and very nice game   the CS1.6 is really old sucks texture but old times it was great.
181	0	a	get css its safer i tried to join 2 servers it loaded for a bit then failed manged to enter the first one for 2 seconds then gone then some arabe dude on steam added me 5 seconds later and he was playing cs 1.6 wtf i didnt even enter server for 2 seconds â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ im outta here deleted this game and blocked that dude XD hell no here proof  http://steamcommunity.com/id/tabdeli

191	0	a	Spent nearly 2 years on this. Don't know why
192	0	a	One will find it is quite easy to encounter persons of highly polished skills in the original version of the Counter-Strike games. This is evidenced by thousands of hours on many of the players records; keep in mind that Steam has not been tracking game hours for a good few years after it first came out with this mod!  I highly suggest one passes by this out of date game, as classic as it may be. I compare an exaggeration of the experience for a new player to that of being anally entered, spontaneously, by barbed nethers. Overwhelming, painful, and a strong sense of defenselessness.  One would do well to instead spend their time playing the latest, 'sexiest' version, anyway. After all, the gameplay is an evolution on the one this game has to offer. I also recommend passing over the current middle-child version: Source.
193	0	a	in 2011, I would have recomended this game, but sadly, it has degenerated beyond recognition. its sad to see such a great game fall. you need only join a server once to see that cs 1.6 is no more. get cs cz or cs source as theyre better choices these days.
194	0	a	It was better before 2010 when there were not so many hackers. Now is full of hackers... in CS:GO are like 30%-50% of hackers but in cs 1.6 there are over 60% hackers. Poor game now.
195	0	a	AFTER I BOUGHT OFFICIAL CS 1.6 ON STEAM, I WAS KICKED FROM 7 OF 10 SERVERS BECAUSE OF 'FAKE CS CLIENT'. HAIL GABE. 
196	0	a	That's a good game
197	0	a	A fun walk down nostalgia lane. That being said, I haven't seen a reason to replay this game in some time.
198	0	a	Never Play This Game Ever Period End Of Story.............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
199	0	a	I find it impossible to improve at this game in any way.
200	0	a	Not many servers anymore. No point in buying.
201	0	a	Cant connect to any servers Reasons: Fake client i was on idle And other reasons I JUST GET KICKED AND ANOTHER ONE THE SERVER IS FULL BUT NOT! I rate this 1/10 its good but the servers man and wheres the bots? WASTE OF MONEY
202	0	a	Second worst FPS game i have ever played after CSGO
203	0	a	really bad game all time if i press 'g' or 't' its connect to server
204	0	a	Old but gold. But CSGO &gt; CS1.6  Buy this game only in bundles with CSGO. Because game itself is outdated. Still there is plenty unofficial server you can play with awesome gamemodes yo couldn't find in CSGO.
205	0	a	i love counter-strike and all the others but the only problem with it is that it doesnt have a bot system for offline
206	0	a	in this game u shoot and its sucks
207	0	a	What was probably considered then to be the definitive shooter it has now become a boring somewhat empty game with either pros or trolls. 6/10
208	0	a	Honestly it does nothing to explain to the player the concept of accuracy and it ruins the experience, how with just a crosshair am I expected to understand the difference between it being a little wider and a little narrower. Its a fun shooter don't get me wrong, but the whole crosshair â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t is bad and should have been reworked instead of kept in every CS game
209	0	a	â€¢ Old game. â€¢ Old graphic. â€¢ Old engine.  But never get bored.
210	0	a	we cant play single player with bots anymore? not recommanded 
211	0	a	full of veterans
212	0	a	For Nostalgia only the game has aged horribly, not only the graphics, but also the gameplay, and the multiplayer is overrun with cheaters and nerds, ugh, some games are better left in the past, where they belong
213	0	a	This is great if you like â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ things like bloated adminmods and wanna be CAL-i rejects
214	0	a	Won the game in less than an hour. 10/10
215	0	a	This game sucks cant hit â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
216	0	a	its time for cs go
217	0	a	i've god VAC BAN and i dont use cheats ,if u can help me send me an email to  60centx@gmail.com  Thanks
218	0	a	Can't join any servers, I only play alone :(
219	0	a	Classic game. Very innovative at its time and it's fun to play. You should get its second remake Counter-Strike: Global Offensive though which is improved in almost every aspect of the game. Only get this if you're a nostalgic freak :-)

221	0	a	Counter-Strike, this one also known as Counter-Strike 1.6, is a team-based multiplayer realistical/military shooter. And a very well known one at that. It was first available as a free mod for Half-Life 1, being patched regulary up to version 1.6, until recently it got it's way onto Steam, as a serapately sold title.  So, how is the player base? Counter-strike 1.6, being popular self, has an active player base. You will see many servers, up to 32 players. At very least there are many Russian servers, as it had a cult following over there, can't really see past them. On bad side, most seems to prefer 'Terrorist plant C4' mode and then De_Dust2 is the most played map. A lot of servers run small mods, that may alter balance or other small things. And most of it, playerbase had a lot of time to play and master this game, so new players will be more frustated than having fun learning.  Counter-Strike is a very well known realistical FPS. It gained it's popularity while being free mod for popular Half-Life, because it provided something else what wasn't overused yet - realistical shootouts (using models of real weapons, you know) in team multiplayer. Unforgiving and furious. Or unbalanced and twitchy one-shot kills with headshots. Whichever one you prefer.   Counter-Strike has two types of map. First, 'de', is a mode where counter-terrorists have do defends few market spots on map from terrorist. One of the terrorists spawns with C4 in inventrory and has to bring it to one of the marked spots to plant it adn start to countdown of T's victory. Roles change as Terrorists will have now to defend this place from CTs, who's aim now are to defuse the bomb, in which case CTs will win the round, no matter how many more Ts are left. Pretty interesting mode and most played, otherwise this game would have been camping fest. And if one site is too well defended, Ts can go to another one. And then there is a second type, 'cs', in which CTs have to to rescue hostages by bringing them back to base. The problem there, is that hostage NPCs aren't perfect (though good enough) and since CTs have to rescue them all, Terrorist can camp in one of the spots around them, since CTs will have no choice but to come to win. Much less played and even if it does, it goes like your everyday Team Deathmatch, just killing all of opposite team. Much simpler anyway.  Now, the core gameplay... There are few rounds. Each round starts with each team spawning on their side of map. There is no respawning during round, once person is dead he is out, so you will have to worry much more about getting insta-killed. There are no items placed on map itself either (on correct, official maps), no kind of medikits. In spawn place, you have 15 seconds to press 'b' button (or whichever you set) to bring up 'buy menu', where you purchase weapons and equipment for the round witht he money that you earned so far. Yep, when round ends everybody gets some sum of money to spend, with winning team getting more, an ingenius design decision that helps losing team to get steamrolled even harder. What you can buy there is a pistol, primary weapon and any of the equipment. (Yep, if it doesn't smell like prototype of modern military shooters) Once past purchase screen, you are free to run and shoot. And here comes the art of recoil and aiming. For you see, one of the more important thing that is used in this game is accuaricy of your weapon. If you move it drops. if you jump, it drops. It drops while you are shooting too. Thus it becomes more importanly to get good position, making assaults more compilated, and you often have to relearn to shoot, making few clicks instead of just holding down mouse button. You will have to be often walking instead of running, to keep accuaricy while moving (it also makes you silent, so do it often), or just stand and crouch sometimes. Burst shooting is better there and for long range targets you want to be just click few times. Another important thing is that you can shoot through some walls with more powerful primary weapons. So don't be surprised for people shooting through door, walls and even just over the corner, it indeed does small damage to whoever is behind. The game also emphasises aiming because it supports headshots and they do a MASSIVE damage. And you also got three kinds of grenades. Explosive (HE), which explodes, good for throwing into chokepoints. Flashbang, which blinds whoever looked at it when it blows for few seconds, quite annoying but good for stroming into room. And Smoke Grenade, when you don't want enemies to see you coming and don't want to be under direct fire, good for open spaces with snipers (who instakill you when you peek around corner). Protip: You run slightly faster with knife out.  And well, while on theory it sounds interesting, as well as empashises teamwork. here comes the downfall of the game. The weapons, while make people with gun fetish happy, are badly balanced around each other. There are just best and bad weapons. From pistols Desert Eagle is the best, they behave as backup when you got no time to reload primary weapon. Shotguns are theorically good for close range but in this game they are useless and Assault Rifles can kill even better at close range. Sub-Machine Guns category had advantage of no accuaricy drops while moving, but are still inferior to Rifles. Rifles category has two best guns: all-range assault rifle like AK-47 and all-range sniper rifle like AWP (which doesn't even require headshot to one-hit kill), exactly what majority of people use. The only Machine Gun is 'pew pew pew can't hit'. And all-range is all-range, random is random. You may run and shoot in general direction of enemy and pull off a headshot from your AK-47 by luck. Or you may walk around corner, thinking of your next grandious tactical plan, just to get headshotted in insta-second by guy with sniper rifle from close range. It's just so full of cheap and frustating, the rage is probably the main thing that keeps players coming back for more, not honest fun, as well as luck of possibly pulling few magical headshots. Slow-down when being hit doesn't seem to be good idea either, making it harder to get away from the choke points. And random spread is not actually random, it just randomly follows one of the pre-set pattern. And yes, if you will learn them, you will be able to control your shooting better and get on top. Exactly what puts apart newbiews and elites, and exactly what elites seem to boast about when they want to say that Counter-Strike 1.6 is the best because it takes more skills and time to learn, with artifical challenges like this one that makes little sense. And well, once you spend your time to learn them, you will still find out on top that it didn't make the game any more amazing.  But you know, it's not too bad. It does teamwork well. Sometimes the game just works. When you work along the team, round the corners and storming the next room, where you follow teammates, supporting each other. Provide covering fire to the corner. When upon entering next place, each one covers his own direction, as some of the rooms just have too many places from which enemies can shoot you (smoke grenade and flashbangs help in these cases). And it's pretty damn nice at those moments, until they get ruined by something stupid, something you don't feel like could be prevented. Yea, getting shot by sniper.  And yes, this game has good enough sounds. No music, sadly. The graphics are quite HL1 high-definition era, but otherwise are fine enough. The levels are a bit of bland though.  Can't really recommend it. Because everybody who will like such games are already playing it. And player base of this game had too much time by now, that they will be just way too skilled for new players, who will just get destroyed and it will take a long time to get onto same level. It's not like there aren't enough military/realistical shooters anyway.

233	0	a	terrible game.    waste of money.
234	0	a	I just bought Counter-Strike and I can't play it because the mouse aiming doesn't work. I really want my money back.
235	0	a	Very boring, played it a few times, and never played it again. Waste of money.
236	0	a	One of the most over-rated game ever. Other mods died while CS didnt die when it should have. The lack of changes and improvements to the base game trough years is utterly disgusting and not a proper excuse. Character slows down when its shot? Server side location tracking instead of client based for better accurate data? Years behind other mods, that died.

After steam updated the fpsengine and made other changes to the game after more than 10 years of good gameplay, I would rather say that this is a now a rip-off. The game doesn't work properly and the developers isn't listening to the players when they're updating the game.   If steam would roll back the game to before they update I would recommend this game because of the good gameplay. At the moment because of the update I just want my money back!

246	0	a	Outdated graphics, and my bullets wont hit ever except when im really close. Why would anyone buy this when there are free games like battlefield:heroes that have better graphics and control better. Also, the amount of hacking in this game is tremendous, i join a server and about 30% of the people playing are using some form of hacx. The biggest rip-of off my life.

254	0	a	wasted too much of my life on this one
255	0	a	The servers are dead,Vac anti cheat is dead so mexicans and hackers rule the semi-alive servers. Vote trump to make counter strike great again.Also God is dead. All gold source games removing Sven coop and half life are dead
256	0	a	wrost gaem i evre prayed
257	0	a	Because I'm such a huge fan of CS:GO and CS:S, I decided to purchase and play the original Counter Strike. However good the game may be it's all based on petty nostalgia. If you were to compare the game to CS:S or CS:GO you would realize how inferior it really is to the two. You might say that CS:GO turned crap once Valve added cases and payed cosmetics, and in turn that makes CS 1.6 better than CS:GO. To that I say CS:GO has better graphics (no surprise) and better controls, if it's the payed skins that turn you away from the game then just don't buy skins/cases/keys. Overall I would say based on CS 1.6's time period it's a revolutionary game, however compared to modern choices the game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.  5/10

4717	1	a	A clusterâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ of prepubescent children. Famous for the useless â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ people stick on their servers. Also home of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and according to Hilary Clinton causes the most school shootings after Doom. Cunter-Strike is a Massively Multiplayer Online First Person Shooter mod for the hit online electronic computing internets machine game 'Half-life' made many years ago.   It is aimed at brainless 13 year old boys and lifeless nerds who think it's cool, not knowing it's a secret recruiting tool for the special forces. Though of course no one can actually get into them, and real tools who can't distinguish between gaming and IRL bad ideas join the army. (Please note, if you're playing this game, you are gay. There is no hope, other than learning how to play better.)   Note: Requirements include being a â™¥â™¥â™¥ and looking like Brian Peppers.

4837	1	a	What can i say, the all time greatest. Just buy it to support the e-sports.
4839	1	a	Pretty good.
4841	1	a	Classic. I and much of the community moved on to Source or CS:GO, but this game will always be fun. Back when this game wasn't on Steam, a couple of friends and I played this on LANs. I still revisit this game from time to time, half of it for the fun, and half of it for the nostalgia.  There is still a very active multiplayer community so you'll definitely get your money's worth. Get some mod's, make some friends, have a blast!
4843	1	a	This year , 99 is make a best Multyplayer shooter ever , realy , good job VALVE ! :D
4845	1	a	Pure classic - you must buy this game if you're a fan of FPS compared with TeamPlay.
4847	1	a	very nice game
4849	1	a	classic.
4851	1	a	Still a great game after many years!
4853	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
4855	1	a	The only extremely good Counter-Strike game, unforunately they updated it and things got a bink wonky, but it's still more impressive than CS:GO.
4857	1	a	Great game.
4859	1	a	+1
4861	1	a	The game is very fun for its age and I have had a lot of fun playing this. This game means a lot to me and to some of my friends. This game was my first ever multiplayer game when I started playing it in 2007, when I didnt have steam and had to pirate it, sadly. I'm fairly sad that it is dying, but it had a good run. 10/10
4863	1	a	This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:  I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over and he didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I don't remember a day when I was so happy like back then. So, the journey started. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a whole experience. Playing public servers and maybe some servers with mods was very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.   I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO, but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games.  I am glad that I lived through the golden era of shooters and if I'd have to rate it, it'd 10/10 ofcourse,
4865	1	a	+
4867	1	a	BEST GAME !
4869	1	a	VAC is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t RIP CS :/
4871	1	a	Best game in the history!  Join HidenSeek today and be awesome!
4873	1	a	It's a world filled with racists, 12 year olds, drug addicts and Mexicans. They call it - CS 1.6
4875	1	a	The real pillar of all FPS games ever to sprout out into the competitive scene. It's been around for as long as I can remember and has literally changed the eSports scene. Very balanced and runs on one of the smoothest engines every made for a first person shooter. The game is outdated now and its successor CS:GO is doing a good job at satisfying the professional scene while maintaining a very challenging and exciting gameplay
4877	1	a	;;
4879	1	a	I don't need to say anything about this masterpiece.   CS:GO has been out for 2 years now. As a long time CS fan (Yes the hours on STEAM are short but if they logged the data on my game disk there would be at least 3000 hours on it) Counter-Strike 1.6 just gives me a certain feeling none of the later CS games give me. Listen, if you happen to be reading this because you are thinking of buying it, get it. It will be one of the most action-packed amazing $10 you'll ever spend.
4881	1	a	LIke this game !
4883	1	a	.
4885	1	a	Legendary game with absoludly fantastic gameplay :) I spent about 2000h on nonsteam version of this game and then i bought it, becose i got a respect to the developers and becose i loved and i still love this game. 11/10 there wont be any same and great game as 1.6.

4923	1	a	EAC is trash... CAUTION
4925	1	a	Almost 7 years of playing this game and still goin' on! I hope it will not die because of global offensive. It will be a good idea to introduce steam achievements/trading cards for it, because it's a very played game

4929	1	a	Classick!!!
4931	1	a	..

4945	1	a	My first love when I was 8 :D
4947	1	a	Counter-Strike is one of those games that still has people playing on servers 15 years later and probably still will due to it's addictive and competitive gameplay. Strongly Recommend it. 10/10
4949	1	a	the best game until csgo release
4951	1	a	a verry good game and verry old !!!!!!!!
4953	1	a	One of the best shooters ever made. No levels, no accessories for your guns, no 'cheat' guns... just you and your skill.  Lots of hours spent in this game and so much fun I have had with it.   8.5/10  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Uno de los mejores shooters de la historia. No hay niveles, ni accesorios, ni armas 'chetadas'... solo tÃº y tu habilidad.  Muchas horas jugadas en este juego y me he divertido mucho con Ã©l.  8.5/10
4955	1	a	I've spent so many hours playing this game, meeting new people.  I you've never played this game... what's wrong with you?
4957	1	a	What better than a classic, there's nothing really left to say about this game. It's wonderful, totally worth of it's entire price, that isn't that much either.
4959	1	a	Counter Strike is a game that teaches you how to use your eyes to there full potential.  You must be a fast thinker and good at stratigic thought.
4961	1	a	.....
4963	1	a	This game is so good man 10/10 IGN Even 'Counter Strike Source' is more dead than this even here in 2015 its still funny Man trust me so funny!
4965	1	a	Classic~

4977	1	a	Just a fun old school game
4979	1	a	;)
4981	1	a	Man awesome game been playing for years now thats all i can say :)
4983	1	a	I found that once I lowered my resolution to 640 x 480 I became 70% better at the game. Makes heads bigger and easier to aim at so it's pretty similar to CS:S. gg ez noobs get rekt fgts easily 9/10 go buy it
4985	1	a	very cool game :D
4987	1	a	This has to be one of my favorite CS games of all time :)!

4991	1	a	/thread
4993	1	a	The years have mold this game very nicely for the past 14 years this game has gone down as the FPS that started the series off with bang this game has everything from tatical game play to zombie infection modes. The game is made for all the FPS junkies out there its 14 yrs old but still puts smiles on all the gamers faces as they play this forever great series of games from the gaben overlord all hail the valve group for giving us this amazing game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4995	1	a	The old games its the best!!!!
4997	1	a	Addictive,But...Awesome!
4999	1	a	The best
5001	1	a	juz loved it :)itz really nc
5003	1	a	I played this game when it was just a third party mod for half life. I cant tell you how many hours of my life I spent fragging my friends. It is still my old standby and even though steam took it over eventually they preserved its life for an online game. I recommend you play the classic whenever you get a feeling for nostalgia.
5005	1	a	Can't get enough of this game, even after 12 years!
5007	1	a	One of the best games in this world !!!
5009	1	a	Nice game :D
5011	1	a	Best game 10/10 . If you have time you should play it :) Worth it's money,even for an old game,still rocking the shooters market.
5013	1	a	They broke the mold with this one.
5015	1	a	only game worth playing.
5017	1	a	&lt;3 this game :p XD :D
5019	1	a	I can think back to the days when I had this game on CD, It was amazing. This game IS still amazing.  The game is refreshing to play and is jam packed filled with fun! It is my favourite game from the series due to the fact that this game relates back to the times when I first started computer gaming and is a classic which everyone will enjoy!  Pick this game up now!
5021	1	a	Nice game
5023	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ the bomb-diggy.
5025	1	a	the best
5027	1	a	:)
5029	1	a	Best first person game ever....^_^ Do u love first person game..dont have graphic card....this is the game meant for u.......^_^
5031	1	a	A simple 3D shooter game. Needs a lot of skill, some strategy and some brain of course.
5033	1	a	Old is still Gold. Best online action game ever!
5035	1	a	great one!
5037	1	a	Evergreen game .Still play it with friends
5039	1	a	wish i played this a few years ago tbh
5041	1	a	If you haven't played it yet your not really a gamer!
5043	1	a	CS 1.5 or 1.6 was the birth place for me, to be a PC Gamer - 10/10 !!
5045	1	a	Old school player ! Love this game.
5047	1	a	great game
5049	1	a	Awesome game.. A must play FPS
5051	1	a	Great game, proving graphics aren't everything. Recommend buying the game and enjoying the PRO experience!
5053	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
5055	1	a	Jumped into a game, got shot, respawned got shot, respawned got shot. Although this happened i probably should of looked at controls and realised i could buy other guns and stuff. still a good game 6/10
5057	1	a	NIce much better than valve!
5059	1	a	Good ol' CS 1.6, best played on LAN.
5061	1	a	:)
5063	1	a	Very cool and balanced game. Superb gameplay and unbelievably good for tournaments. Once you've played it you'll never regret it. The only bad thing about this game is the community. It's full of scrubs, lamers, scammers, spammers and hackers. Its very hard to find a good and clean from all those dudes server, but when you do find it, you will forget all about them and will enjoy all your hours of play.
5065	1	a	The best 'realism' Half-Life mod as it's the one everyone remembers. Causing incalculable rage in dialup users for years and years. If you're bad you're a nub, if you're good you're a hacker, if you're just mediocre then you're just right.
5067	1	a	The best ever.
5069	1	a	.
5071	1	a	Cool game.
5073	1	a	Nice game!
5075	1	a	Well, what can I say? You know what to do.
5077	1	a	Rating: 10/10  The game which basically brought me to the world of gaming. From 1.05 to 1.6 I have spent enormous number of hours playing this game and even it's now getting old and pushed out by CS:GO, I still have nostalgy. Best non-story FPS at that time and still better than many modern FPS movie-based games.
5079	1	a	Same old CS... Good game, one of the best shooters of all time.  Nowadays it's graphics seems a little outdated. But HL engine still works pretty nice.  Still better and less robotic than CS:GO.
5081	1	a	$$$
5083	1	a	really awsome game really recomend it
5085	1	a	Pretty Dope
5087	1	a	Great game and classic FPS game! Should play if you like shooting and..shooting :D
5089	1	a	Great game
5091	1	a	So good, Classic FPS game. Alive for decades!
5093	1	a	Best Counter Vs. Terro game
5095	1	a	If you pick up this game now, you will most probably get wrecked by people who have mastered the game. Just a warning. Bloody good game though.
5097	1	a	Great game. Spent untold countless hours with it.
5099	1	a	Greatset of all time
5101	1	a	Enough said ;) BUY IT!
5103	1	a	Can't wait for Counter-Strike 2.0
5105	1	a	Nice game

5211	1	a	.
5213	1	a	0_0
5215	1	a	There really isn't much to say about this game that most people don't already know. It is a classic in any and every definition of the word. Although the graphics are now considered quite dated, it somehow doesn't change the appeal and visual accessibility of the game itself. Perhaps newer gamers and people trying it out for the first time in today's gaming world will never develop a bond that veteran CS players will forever cherish with the old school counter-strike, but for us, this game will always be the go-to first person shooter and will endure as the trend-setting sage of all future shooting games to come. Rivaled only by the likes of the Battlefield series (though obviously not comparable as they are essentially different games albeit being first-person shooters both), counter-strike is an absolute treasure and for the pennies you could snatch it for, it is definitely worth your while as well. If you do not have this game, please buy it.

5259	1	a	5/5
5261	1	a	The granddaddy of FPS!!!!
5263	1	a	Great game..
5265	1	a	Best game ever made... Domination of movemenet, shooting mechanics - recoil... Exaclty what a FPS game need... When developers of this game genre learn that this 2 things are the most inportant for good FPS, they will make a game as good as CS 1.6 is... CS:GO does not have these major aspects, and doesn't deserve name of Counter-Strike (IMO). As a third very important thing for FPS game, I would say the animations... The animations of player models such as runnig, walking, crouching, gun holding/fireing/reloading etc... Graphics isn't so important, doesn't need to be sooo good, but decent due to visibility...
5267	1	a	Over 1000 Hours and still playing!
5269	1	a	Really nice game!!!
5271	1	a	Best game ever , I played it since 2004
5273	1	a	10/10
5275	1	a	Great and cheap multiplayer awesomeness!
5277	1	a	Its the most ultimate game a person can ever play !!! Love Everything about it !!!
5279	1	a	Good game, but keep in mind its hard to find pcw now when cs go came out!
5281	1	a	It's decent.
5283	1	a	This game has a odd aiming system compared to CSGO and CSS so this is a true classic and it is still fun today but it does show its age a little. 8.9/10
5285	1	a	True good memories , couldnt forget it ~
5287	1	a	HELLO I HAVE PURCHASED CS ANTHOLOGY ,BUT WHEN I AM TRYING TO INSTALL TO UPDATE STEAM IT ALWAYS SHOWS FATAL ERROR ,THERE IS NO INTERNET CONNECTION ,HOW CAN I RESOLVE THIS ISSUE BECAUSE IF I DO NOT UPDATE IT ,I CAN NOT LO GIN TO PLAY .PLS HELP ME.
5289	1	a	....
5291	1	a	Doesn't need no intro.. I mean come on, this is CS1.6. The godfather of all competetive tactical shooters! Best FPS to date. _O_
5293	1	a	Best of the best
5295	1	a	fun to play wid frnds
5297	1	a	!
5299	1	a	Best game ever...spent more than 10 happy years playing it. Beware of cheaters tho. GL &amp; HF
5301	1	a	One of the Best First Person Shooters Ever  the thing that makes this game so awesome is that you will always have competition and theres no excuse for losing or winning because the only thing that can make you good in it is experience there are no in-game purchases and its really hard to get pro or even decent as it doesnt have auto-recovery as many FPS nowdays Highly Recommended
5303	1	a	The legendary 1.6. Worth all the money, eventhough there is cs:go and css. BRILLIANT!
5305	1	a	Great game and what I suggest is getting it on steam because it comes with condition zero and it's better like that because condition zero has a campaign and normal counter-strike is great with multiplayer so get this game
5307	1	a	good game but can be frustrated! :D
5309	1	a	Play Hard Go Pro
5311	1	a	this is like , old is gold :)
5313	1	a	Do I need to say why do I recommend this? Because this is freakin' awesome! That's why...!
5315	1	a	Whenever I play this game I have the urge to go back to high school then smoke some dank buds and tell my mom to go to hell. Linkin Park 4 ever.
5317	1	a	great game.
5319	1	a	i never played it
5321	1	a	preety much the best game of all time
5323	1	a	One old, but good thing :)
5325	1	a	Got old but still good ^^ recomanded
5327	1	a	...
5329	1	a	Well, when it comes to an good old fashioned cops n' robbers chase, it doesn't get any better than Counter Strike. Sure some might call the 90's graphics outdated and the weapons unbalanced. That's why some just buy the other games such as GO or source. IF you doesn't have any problem with sweet and smooth nostalgia, then Counter Strike is for you! :D
5331	1	a	Cool
5333	1	a	No Classes, Bad Level design, no fish AI. It's horrible.  11/10, srsly buy it, its better than Call of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Money Stealing â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s Modern Season Pass.  It's the father of todays fps(grandfather being the quake and doom games) and it's still fun.
5335	1	a	AWesome game!!! one of my favourites.
5337	1	a	Can enter only original, new mode surf ski server manages a unique mode Who publishes a candidate for Admin Ielhhh join now =] 84.94.214.173:20889    $$$$$$ Cs 1.6 $$$$$$
5339	1	a	its a cool game 
5341	1	a	i don't currently have much hours on the game but from a beginers standpoint it's a really solid game. just has a pretty steep learning curve and i still die more than i kill but when you do kill someone it's pretty cool that guy has to wait like 3 minutes before he can play again. 8/10
5343	1	a	Great!
5345	1	a	Perfect game :)
5347	1	a	This game is awesome, thanks valve for making it. I know its very old tho =D
5349	1	a	Nice Game !!!
5351	1	a	Epic-super-awsome box game thing
5353	1	a	I like this very much!
5355	1	a	Not B + R Friendly. Came for the dusters, stayed for the rats.   11/10
5357	1	a	Best FPS competitive shooter on steam. Better than CS Source and CS Global Offensive. A lot of cool mods to. Idk if they have leagues still but make a team with friends and have fun, or meet new people in public servers.
5359	1	a	that's classic  
5361	1	a	click click booooom!
5363	1	a	It fuâ€ªâ€«â€¬â€­ckin sucks, It suckin fuâ€ªâ€«â€¬â€­cks, It fuâ€ªâ€«â€¬â€­ckin blows, It's a piece of shâ€ªâ€«â€¬â€­it, and I don't like it.
5365	1	a	nice game..too cool to play
5367	1	a	Steal good game
5369	1	a	pretty good game hopefully they will get the pro mod out.....other then that a badass game for sure

5433	1	a	Old School
5435	1	a	1.6 the best
5437	1	a	Old but gold
5439	1	a	Counter-Strike, it is literally impossible to be a PC gamer and not know what this game is. They're all great. Go play them.
5441	1	a	What a fun game. As a single play mania it was a little bit shame to see no bots in Counter Strike but there were still many servers running so you'll have no problem playing it. Since there were no active asian servers because Nexon got hold of asian market with 'Counter Strike Online' I had to play in a Brazilian server which made me go through horrible lag but even with the lag it was still enjoyable. Gear up, You can still enjoy the beginning of Counter Strike series.   +) Easy and straightforward game play. Shoot on sight. +) Optimized Aiming.
5443	1	a	The best game &lt;3....
5445	1	a	Old School &lt;3

5475	1	a	The Best
5477	1	a	Awsome Game.

5519	1	a	Classic FPS of my generation. Enjoy &lt;3
5521	1	a	Buy Steam accaunt 6 $ 
5523	1	a	That is so good :) !
5525	1	a	A timeless classic. This game got me started on steam. I wasted many non-recorded hours of my life on this game. The buggy vehicles are the most fun vehicles I've ever played with in any game ever. I can't believe they left vehicles out of the source engine games. I also miss nipper maps and the community surrounding them.
5527	1	a	ItÂ´s counter strike, just buy it.
5529	1	a	The first FPS/Game I played on PC and to be honest those years playing CS1.6 (5+years) were simply AMAZING !  At the time the gameplay was perfect ! the game was really easy to handle and understand, the graphisme ? When it came out it was really good and enough, then the game never grew up and we never had patchs / new versions. But it was still fine as long as we could all developpe our skill and create new strats.  We got a lot of mods like zombie deathmatch gungame jail and for me the best mods Hide'N'Seek, Kz, Deathrun etc...  To be honest those years were truly a pleasure to play.  Thank you so much to create a game like that.  Without counting that now we have new versions and eSport is growing everyday!
5531	1	a	It's an awesome game.I wish for a long time to buy it on steam and finally I did it.And now I am enjoy it.I have more possibilities and more 'doors opend'
5533	1	a	BEST GAME OF THE WORLD
5535	1	a	great game
5537	1	a	,,Need Help' I need Cs 1.6 Set launch setub please help me.    
5539	1	a	!
5541	1	a	The best
5543	1	a	Cool + rep
5545	1	a	The Best &lt;3
338	0	a	The best game in the world at one time. But now, it's time to admit that other, newer games have taken its spot. There's little reason to play the original CS other than for historical curiosity.
5547	1	a	It hasn't aged that well, but it still holds a lot of nostalgia. It also lacks offline deathmatches with AI bots. Otherwise, it's a great game.   FINAL RATING: 82 out of 100
5549	1	a	Well it's an oldschool csgo, i would recommend this game to the guys/girls with the .... not so high tech computer!! :)
5551	1	a	
5553	1	a	Counter Strike: everybody know what this mean.
5555	1	a	Is a good game from our childhood
5557	1	a	.
5559	1	a	OLDIE BUT GOLDIE !!
5561	1	a	This game is just.. LIFE. Especially the mod Hide 'n Seek
5563	1	a	Defining FPS since 1999.
5565	1	a	great game
5567	1	a	Best game since rocket league, uhm no wait
5569	1	a	Counter-Strike 1.6 is easily one of the best shooters out there. I have good history of making teams and playing against other teams or just having fun with friends in public servers. It was out of this world when it came out and in my opinion had the best professional scene at the time. I played it on and off for about 7 years.   Bud sadly CS 1.6 doesn't hold up for me. Until playing CSGO I was still very into the game. After playing CSGO for few months I tried playing CS 1.6 again, but the graphics and shooting mechanics are just awful at this point, it just doesn't hold up.  If you are new to gaming or just Counter-Strike, you should probably skip this game and just go right to Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. It's an amazing upgrade from an amazing game.
5571	1	a	Cs 4 Life
5573	1	a	This was the beginning of an obsession. I love you.

5607	1	a	wtf is dis awp they all talk about
5609	1	a	classic !
5611	1	a	It's a good game and i really like it, but the trouble is: The players who have Counter-Strike 1.6 cracked, 70% has hacks. Please Valve, resolve all hackers. Thank you for reading my review Valve. Oh, wait. I wanted to say something. THIS GAME NEVER GETS OLD &lt;3 :*
5613	1	a	Great game, best cs
5615	1	a	0ld But Gold.............
5617	1	a	:)
5619	1	a	Best team fps ever.
5621	1	a	2 minutes of silence for all the deaths in de_dust2
5623	1	a	.
5625	1	a	.
5627	1	a	I do not have much to say on Counter-Strike/CS:1.6 but with it being the first stand-alone game modification for Half Life using the (Gold) Source Development Kit it turned out pretty well even in the 1.0/1.5 mod, oh yes and the hostages on 1.0 where scientists, due to the fact the developers didn't make some hostage NPC models in time for the release and the Hostage models where still NPCS and came out later in 1.6. And during Beta Version 4 (B-V4) Valve became interested in the game that was being developed, hired the developers for valve to help make it better, and in a few years the original developers quit making the game and let Valve take control of it. If you like the classic First Person Shooters from around 1995-2002 this is basically the game for you. Also you can shoot through almost every wall with every gun in the game. I give this game an 9/10
5629	1	a	best game for all of lovers (y)
5631	1	a	!
5633	1	a	Addictive :D
5635	1	a	I RECOMEND THIS GAME BECAUSE THIS GAME IS REAL GOOD GAME

5643	1	a	Incredibly good game.

5671	1	a	90s'
5673	1	a	I've been playing CS Source and GO for a while now, I bought the valve pack and thought it'd be fun the play those games since i've always been a Half-Life fan. I've played it when i was younger, and it brings back memories.  The game is really nice, still to this day. I love playing new maps, do scrims and have fun with my Competitive team.  Would recommend! Although most servers are Spanish, it's still fun if you don't know the language.
5675	1	a	:)
5677	1	a	This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:  I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over and he didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I don't remember a day when I was so happy like back then. So, the journey started. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a whole experience. Playing public servers and maybe some servers with mods was very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.   I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO, but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games.  I am glad that I lived through the golden era of shooters and if I'd have to rate it, it'd 10/10 ofcourse,
5679	1	a	This game I don't like because they are all using a cheat... Otherwise its good :)
5681	1	a	BEST GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED IN MY LIFE I MOSTLY PLAY WITH MY FRIENDS ONLINE LOVE IT I WOUD RATE 5 STAR OUT OF 5
5683	1	a	classic!
5685	1	a	Best cs i`ve ever played. You need strong aim, hard brain and not the best computer to master this game. Played this between 2002-2009, old graphic but perfect balanced and maps with clearly edges .  Its my favoured shooter between 2000-2010. Buy and play it
5687	1	a	This first person shooting game is quite good. but the developers might have worked on the Bugs. Its pretty much addictive. Best for LAN gaming, less suitable for Internet gaming in India
5689	1	a	It's a must have, no question asked. If you don't own it, go to the nearest mirror, slap yourself, look how stupid you look. Once you're done with this bad advice I gave you, return to your computer &amp; add the game to your Steam cart &amp; purchase it right away. [Don't do tomorrow what can be done today.]
5691	1	a	the one and only, forever &lt;3
5693	1	a	!!!!!! 
5695	1	a	:)
5697	1	a	Counter-Strike is a classic team-based multiplayer game combining fast gameplay with a simple map system of planting/defusing bombs and rescuing/holding hostages. The game established many basic multiplayer features that are now taken for granted in newer multiplayer games.
5699	1	a	ok, i love the game, but i kinda messed up the resolution, and now it makes my game huge and i cant see most of the screen. what do i do to fix it? 
5701	1	a	This games community is not that ruined as its rivals
5703	1	a	Graphics Does'nt Matter
5705	1	a	let's come back to the best game ;D 
5707	1	a	Quite simply the best first person shooter.
5709	1	a	its very fun game , but its hard for newbies
5711	1	a	A classic. Can't beat it
5713	1	a	Still great, after so many years.
5715	1	a	Nice game
5717	1	a	i love this game but now iam going to cs.go bay cs
5719	1	a	Classic and still played
5721	1	a	one of the best cybergame!
5723	1	a	Nice game for people who have got a wooden PC like me...
5725	1	a	Still playing!
5727	1	a	Very nice ... oldschool game
5729	1	a	This is a great game. Very different from go
5731	1	a	My favorite game of all TIME
5733	1	a	AWESOME GAME !! IN THE WORLD LOVE TO PLAY IT ! :D
5735	1	a	.
5737	1	a	The most classic FPS game. Counter-Strike is a mod of the legendary Half-Life by Valve. Even if it was released at 1999, people still play it due to its essential playabillity. It contains a lot of different gamemodes and you can easily learn how to play it. I recommend it.
5739	1	a	recomand !
5741	1	a	Best game in the history!  1.6 Never die!
5743	1	a	Old is gold :)
5745	1	a	Better than source
5747	1	a	The Greatest Game Ever Created, My Childhood. I'll always have a spot in my heart for 1.6 If 1 review has every lead you to try a game, let this be the one, you're not a gamer until you've played Counter-Strike 1.6 PERIOD.
5749	1	a	3123213
5751	1	a	Ahh... Good old times.
5753	1	a	First game i got on steam. played it so much. best version of counter-strike no doubt.
5755	1	a	Been playing Counter-Strike for years, although I've never seen a Counter-Strike game in which the 'Terrorists' are caucasian I must say they're still fun games. The X-Box version had the 'terrorists' be oriental, which made me question the game slightly, but it does not ruin the fun factor. Would recommend to anyone who enjoys games. Why buy 'COD' when you can buy this wonderful timeless game that doesn't cheat you of your money but makes it worthwhile, get bored? Lots of custom servers to play. Enjoy.
5757	1	a	Probably the best shooter ever.
5759	1	a	I really miss this game :(
5761	1	a	.
5763	1	a	Every one that plays this game is not english. period.
5765	1	a	Here's my 12 word review for this beautiful game. Every time i play this it takes me back to my childhood.
5767	1	a	not as awful as the other ones
5769	1	a	My Love &lt;3
5771	1	a	
5773	1	a	Wat can i say, if u love fps games, playing with friends, having fun, crusing people and saying evey better player who is better than u a hacker....then this is the perfect game for u :P
5775	1	a	It's a classic!
5777	1	a	Fun but when i try to move it doesnt let me but when it does its fun (it lets me move5% of the time)
5779	1	a	My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him: 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately!'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me: 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through.' I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.
5781	1	a	8/8
5783	1	a	Nice game :)
5785	1	a	#1
5787	1	a	This game is a bit old, sure, but it was revolutionary back in its day. The first time I played this, I was hooked - both into Counter-Strike, and Steam as a whole. I love the simple yet complicated game-play. Brilliant, fast-paced multi-player action, with also single-player (and co-op) missions for Counter-Strike: Zero lets you experience quite a rush. If you enjoy this title, be sure to pick up the later CS titles, too; Global Offensive and Source. Definitely recommend this to everyone, both young and old, new and experienced.
5789	1	a	good old 1.6 love is in the air &lt;3
5791	1	a	bought it. played it. got it taken off me for some reason.   I would buy again.
5793	1	a	My childhood in this game &lt;3
5795	1	a	This game actualy take my Life :v i cant stop playing it since i kicked my enemys a$$ out ! to all who say 10/10 dont make me laugh it deserve more than 999999999999999/10 you fools !  its all about good memories &lt;3 love yA
5797	1	a	Wall banged through an entire concrete building. 10/10
5799	1	a	I have been playing 1.6 before, now it's kinda memories for me.
5801	1	a	The best shooter !
5803	1	a	Best childhood Game Still Playing with Homies Still Better Than COD And It's Better Than csgo
5805	1	a	123
5807	1	a	Nice Game &lt;3 I Like It :D
5809	1	a	*_*
5811	1	a	old but gold
5813	1	a	I liked it, but now it lacks a player community. Fun, Good and aweosme! 
5815	1	a	Good game. Classic :)
5817	1	a	Greatest game of its time!
5819	1	a	One of the best first person game
5821	1	a	AWESOME MUST HAVE :D
5823	1	a	Is incredible game!!!!! :)))))
5825	1	a	Although i have minimal play time on this game, its because i play CSGO a lot more but this game was a blast to play as even though it has low resolution, it brings fun in a nut-shell however if you love CSGO this one is a bit more complex. The slight lag you may get doesn't matter as its minimal. 9.5/10
5827	1	a	..
5829	1	a	i love this game!
5831	1	a	This game is very good to play on low-power PC since it is old and it even can make you better at CS:GO since the basic gameplay mechanics are extremely similar. I use this game as something to do with my ADHD hands while listening to music which i find to be great (just turn the game sound down and join a Deathmatch Server)
5833	1	a	Great shoot game!
5835	1	a	5*
5837	1	a	Old ain't bad!
5839	1	a	One of my first games, I LOVE IT  (but still I prefer cs:go, because its refreshed version)
5841	1	a	I love this game 100000 / 1
5843	1	a	An original classic, Counter-Strike. Even though on my old account I only had 400 hrs compared to my 1,200 on Source, This game was still amazing. Now, CS:GO will take over, but I still enjoy playing 1.6 every once and a while.
5845	1	a	:* this game
5847	1	a	I really like this game.
5849	1	a	Been playing it since it came out...
5851	1	a	pretty fun except for them hackers on gun game.
5853	1	a	! :)
5855	1	a	I played it a lot many years ago. Now, I returned to it. Since I am grown up man, I feel like computer games are not important in my life anymore. BUT!!! I played Counter-Strike again, after 6 years... and... it's still on. It's still so brilliant and addictive and genius. Really, I like it, I LOVE IT!!! I never forget about it. I am acting like a counter-strike-teenage-boy again and I fell I made a right decision, returning back to this game...
5857	1	a	Still the best CS
5859	1	a	eah
5861	1	a	It can run on my beast Windows 98 Machine 10/10
5863	1	a	Nice game !
5865	1	a	greatest fps of all time. rip     
5867	1	a	Well, best game ever. cant stop myself playing it.
5869	1	a	Counter-Strike is just simply one of the best FPS games out there in the PC Gaming Industry! Trust me, it's really worth buying! same goes with it's sequels :D
5871	1	a	old school rocks ofcourse :)
5873	1	a	The best game ever.
5875	1	a	Â¨One of the best shooter games in the world, the master piece that made Valve go to the stars and kick some Treyarch assesÂ¨
5877	1	a	This game ruined my life. Played beta-1.5 30 hours at a time. Easily have hours clocked in the 6 digits between versions, just not on this steam account. Stopped going to school. Stopped eating. Dropped out
5879	1	a	Legendary.
5881	1	a	Nice game
5883	1	a	i remember when i was in high school playing this ahhh the good ol days where you could play a match without being threatend to be swatted anyhow carry on playing the game
5885	1	a	The original classic at its best!
5887	1	a	1.6
5889	1	a	5 years back was really addictive game. 10/10
5891	1	a	A Classic Combat and Strategic VideoGame, Everyone remembers playing Counter-Strike after School.
5893	1	a	This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:  I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over and he didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I don't remember a day when I was so happy like back then. So, the journey started. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a whole experience. Playing public servers and maybe some servers with mods was very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.  I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO, but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games.  I am glad that I lived through the golden era of shooters and if I'd have to rate it, it'd 10/10 ofcourse,
5895	1	a	This game is realy good! Old but gold!
5897	1	a	The mother of all FPS The gameplay is so perfect giving the player the whole control over the character's movement at all times that it tests the players skills. It's a perfect example of a game which is easy to learn but hard to master
5899	1	a	Get on a non-steam server. Wreck everyone. Get banned/destroyed.  10/10 would give my soul again.  P.S these hours are just on steam, i've recently purchased this game, i've played since when i was 4 years old, like 20 hours a week, so 602 hours is just like a .. extra i've played, now i'm 16 years old.
5901	1	a	Vey interesting and good fps game, you all should try this classic game
5903	1	a	!
5905	1	a	One of the best FPS's ever created, while obviously being old &amp; CSGO being the new stuff, there are still small &amp; nice communities left on 1.6 making it worth playing still.
5907	1	a	Best shooter from 2000 till now. Like everything.
5909	1	a	It's nothing like CS;GO as far as mechanics go. I say this because of how you control your character and spray control seems to be very different. The AK-47 has completely random spray pattern. It's not consistent! However the game itself is good, and provides a fair challenge for those who consider themselves to be good at CS;GO. Trust me, you will struggle at first.
5911	1	a	Nice game :)
5913	1	a	Best work till now from valve :D
5915	1	a	A very well made FPS. The grand father of CS:GO  It has a lot of bugs indeed but sometimes it's cool to play with a bunch of old friends :-)
5917	1	a	Still the best FPS
5919	1	a	
5921	1	a	Counter strike is a game that teaches you how to use your eyes to there full potential. You must be a fast thinker and good at stratigic thought. I have NEVER enjoyed a game as much as i do with cs
5923	1	a	.
5925	1	a	Running and shooting has never felt so easy.
5927	1	a	I don't remember how I managed to log this many hours into this, I do not remember at what point in my life this was. Irregardless, timeless classic from what I remember.
5929	1	a	Good multiplayer shooter! Very fun.
5931	1	a	the game of heros
5933	1	a	BEST GAME EVER MADE, with the exception of previous versions like 1.5. I've been playing this game since internet cafes were prevalent and I STILL can't get enough.
5935	1	a	10/10  Would get wrecked by Russians any day.
5937	1	a	The first ever Counter-Strike game that started it all ! The game that marked a generation and taught us that we can run faster with a knife,you will not regret buying this game.   Score: 10/10
5939	1	a	Might be the best game ever made in the history of FPS shooters! 10/10
5941	1	a	...
5943	1	a	One of the best game ever made!
5945	1	a	The best game !
5947	1	a	Nice game .
5949	1	a	reakemduyou bleat'
5951	1	a	1.6 the game i was competitive in :)
5953	1	a	Classic. Probably the best CS.
5955	1	a	The hand models, animations, weapon textures, and custom maps all make this game an enjoyable experience. Oh yeah but just add functional bots so I dont have to download â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Z-Bots, which, are not realistic in any way possible (aimbot, movement patterns, staring contests with enemies).  Although the game is a classic representation of how modernized tactical shooters should be produced, the hackers are always going to be there to ruin the fun. Also, some seriously dysfunctional hit detection occurs during most matches. Also, not trying to be too judgemental, but the game would have been a lot easier to play if the crosshairs had center dots. I say this because Source and G.O. have center crosshair dots, which make aiming much more persistent.   ***8.5/10***  Final Statement:  It's a damn ugly game, but that's what makes it good. Once modded, it can look like it runs on a completely different engine. However, the detail and missing physics are not present due to the limitations of GoldSrc's dated capabilities. Oh, and this game does not deserve to be ran with mods. Just simple and complex retextures of the weapons provided within the game. I would like to tell you that this game is better than Source and G.O., but half the community sticks to the newer iterations rather than the original.
5957	1	a	10/10
5959	1	a	BEST GAME! :)
5961	1	a	544hours on record, not for nothing, best classic ever
339	0	a	Nah, this game is fun but glitch as hell serch for a popper game..
5963	1	a	+++
5965	1	a	I missed this game. This is the best game of all time!
5967	1	a	.
5969	1	a	great game
5971	1	a	cool
5973	1	a	Play hard, go pro!
5975	1	a	i was told to be done with it through  Closed shutters, flooded floors, i wanted to sail out the front door.  morning anew I'm counting the texts you sent me  I'm trying hard to take this well, but the cradle has been rocked and my feelings are a stir.  and I'm not really sure how to approach this landing despair  and so many eyes on me, i felt like commiting suicide  open the door, 40mph, dead forever more  and so little time, we we kids just exploring,  trying to find a way out of this surburban story   And that my friends is an Emo song straight out of the state of New Jersey. Taking back sunday? Thursday? Pffftt this is way more garbage tier than that.
5977	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing neopets is better then this piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game
5979	1	a	The best game ever !
5981	1	a	No FPS game will ever come close to the original Counter-Strike. It's a shame the days when everyone played it are over.
5983	1	a	This Game Is Best
5985	1	a	addictive
5987	1	a	Counter-Strike amazing. Play it.
5989	1	a	:*
5991	1	a	Still the best FPS since Doom2
5993	1	a	:)
5995	1	a	Old but still gold
5997	1	a	10/10
5999	1	a	One of the best games ever made.
6001	1	a	Best game in the genre!
6003	1	a	;)
6005	1	a	The best (CS) game of all time obviously. No talk. No questions.
6007	1	a	It's K.
6009	1	a	4/5
6011	1	a	.
6013	1	a	Classic..
6015	1	a	Awesome fps  gamehttp://store.steampowered.com/app/10/#  too much competitive &lt;3
6017	1	a	Wins Counter-Strike Source and Counter-Strike Global Offensive
6019	1	a	Cannot beat a classic, if you love counterstrike source or counterstrike global offensive play 1.6 if you haven't original always
6021	1	a	Old but very beautiful game
6023	1	a	Inventor of the First Person Tactical Shooter genre a.k.a. MMORPG. Also the first known instance of anger came from this game.
6025	1	a	Verry cool, verry nice, i like it!
6027	1	a	CS 1.6 is the best version ever made. The best FPS game ever made. I have spent thousands and thousands of hours in this game. Still today it will be a bliss to play this game if you like FPS games. Definetely a  MUST  have.
6029	1	a	Old but gold
6031	1	a	dis gaem is like gabens mouth, nice
6033	1	a	NICE GAME ITS BEEN ALOT OF YEARS SINCE I PLAY THIS GAME NEVER GETS OLD :D !!!
6035	1	a	Reminds me of old school gaming
6037	1	a	The most influential FPS game of all time. Probably the best one too.   11/10 i â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing love this game.
6039	1	a	Best game, thanx
6041	1	a	one of the best games ever.
6043	1	a	Counter - Strike Is a game which most off the ppl play in india.... its very intresting game.. I Like Counter - Strike Very Much... xD
6045	1	a	After all these years this shooter remains to be a classic that can't be ignored. No other shooter is as accessible, easy to play, simple nor skillful as this. It can be enjoyed anywhere with the 64MB portable version for LAN parties. It's all about aim, accuracy, quick reflexes but does have a strategical element since it is a tactical shooter and there's no respawning. This game was a major turning point in the history of FPS, and this game is what made online multiplayer competitive gaming so popular.
6047	1	a	:)
6049	1	a	Game is Love!!!!
6051	1	a	idk how can i review this game i dont even have it in my library i have no idea whats going on
6053	1	a	Nice game
6055	1	a	
6057	1	a	The best FPS (First-person shooter) video game ever!
6059	1	a	knowledge is power
6061	1	a	this is a great classic from the 90s
6063	1	a	...
6065	1	a	10/10 still better than any call of duty game 
6067	1	a	I've played this game since I was around 6 years old back in 2002 and it still makes me laugh and have fun whenever I launch it to this very day. Over 12 years of endless entertainment. No other game on this planet has given me more entertainment and enjoyment than Counter-Strike 1.6 has and I doubt no game ever will.  Reason i've only got 38 hours here is because I no longer use the account I originally played cs 1.6 on.   func_vehicle is what makes this Counter Strike game the best out of all the others in the franchise.  Find a server that has car maps or maps with func_vehicle entities and you will have endless fun running over teammates and enemies in all kinds of hilarious and goofy vehicles not giving a care in the world.  You can drive a fork with a meatball on the end of it. Do i need to say more?  Mods on this game are amazing too. There is a mod where you can catch pokemon, level them up, train them and use their skills. Call of Duty mod that is suprisingly better than cod its self, Warcraft mods, zombie mods, basebuilder and so on...  There is even a map for the jailbreak gamemode that has driveable snowmobiles.   1337/10
6069	1	a	Thumbs up mate.
6071	1	a	Old but gold!
6073	1	a	The classic genre-defining FPS. Counter-Strike may be 16 years old but there are thousands of servers with an overflowing amount of players. The difficulty curve is no joke. But once you get used to it, you never get tired of tea-bagging dead players after a headshot. Since it is only multiplayer, you get practically infinite replayability.  8/10 - A Big Heavy Dose of Fun
6075	1	a	I like this game
6077	1	a	Endless game. Buy this game if only you are immortal.
6079	1	a	Good clasic game to revise on and realise how far this game has come :)
6081	1	a	Classic CS

6093	1	a	Very good game best game in the world, better than cs go â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ cs go play cs 1.6 KOSOVO IS SRBIJA â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ SAD!!!! I LIKE RUSSIA
341	0	a	Really Great Classic But Every server I go on I get kicked and banned because people kick me because im not good enough for them and that's not fair is it? well oh well some times.We cant just sit down and enjoy the classics.....

6145	1	a	Old, but gold a.k.a. timeless classic. 10/10 would bang again and again.
6147	1	a	I purchased the Condition Zero Pack and I am very impressed by the game. The only thing is that You should'nt charge the same price for this as just the standalone game. Still one of the best games ever though!    10/10
6149	1	a	I Like this game
6151	1	a	Counter-Strike is an old and challenging game that requires skill and is incredibly addicting.
6153	1	a	classic shooting game, loved it since the first minute
6155	1	a	Great game...I probably.. ya i have about 20k hours in this game. they didnt start counting hours until 2009 so ive been playing since 2000... I played alot of leagues during this era. Been called a hacker more than 1000000 times... Times has changed so time to move onto csgo... If you dont have a mic dont play this if you dont have common sense dont play this if you are hard of hearing dont play this game if you have lack of teamwork, dont play if you dont want to spend 1000s of hours on learning how to play the game.. dont play. takes years and years to become even half way decent...  10/10 would play this all over again from the start of cs.  Now since its 2015.. the game is still alive sorta.. just get csgo and good luck on ur adventure. hope all the best.

6169	1	a	Old But Gold ;)
6171	1	a	Rarely any game nowadays gives you so much control, the game can be perfect extension of your hands, there is barely any limitations in movement as well as in shooting.
6173	1	a	A must-play game in my gen haha
6175	1	a	Best game of all times. 10/10

6219	1	a	The best team shooter game ever!
6221	1	a	The only game that lets you have a 5 kill streak and a defuse with 300+ ping
6223	1	a	That moment of pure passion when your enemy's lifeless body slumps to the ground, and to the top-right of the screen you see your name and feel your score increase.  You might have played this game for 50 hours, or you might have played it for 5,000; but it doesn't matter how experienced you are, because it's all about that moment.
6225	1	a	This game is a legend in Poland
6227	1	a	It's old but timeless. I don't like this game as much as team fortress but it's no doubt a great game. If you like old-school(ish) shooters, than this is for you. Theres still over 20,000 people online too!
6229	1	a	Simply a timeless classic
6231	1	a	Awesome since ever
6233	1	a	best game ever... brings back many old memories :)
6235	1	a	:)
6237	1	a	Best game on earth
6239	1	a	First of all, let me start by saying this game used to be my religion 10 years ago, so I am probably biased.  So many years after its inception, the graphics for Counter-Strike do look pretty dated. of Compared to the quality standards of most of today's shooters, the original Counter-Strike (and likely its predecessors, which very much live in the same vein) may feel a bit rough, unpolished or even at times a bit corny (hostage sounds :p). Still, at it's core, the game is a fast-paced, trigger-reflex shooter.  Edit: I forgot to also include that you can use 'high definition' skins, textures and remodels for pretty much all assets in the game, so the game does have some degree of leeway and customization visually. Back in the day that was one of the things that made this game the bees knees for me. Swapped out my in-game AUG with the model and txt information an LA80, hell yeah! Not a fan of desert eagles? How does a .44 magnum revolver give you the feels? You can also edit the sound files. I remember downloading some sound pack that made Rob Zombie's Dragula play as the round start sound effect and it was almost a month until I finally changed it, to the point where now, 10 years later, I still expect to hear Dragula when I play Counter-strike. These are the things that make me feel nostalgic and think of the late 90s and early 2000; they became iconic for me.   This game is all about making your shots count before the other guy gets his in. Deaths come quickly, wins feel rewarding. The games are split up into objective-based perma-death rounds. If you are a terrorist, you may have to plant a bomb (edgy, I know, but remember how old this game is- concepts came way before 9/11 and the explosion of modern terrorism, etc) and if you found yourself on the Counter-terrorist team, your objective would be to find and secure or disarm the bomb before it's detonated. Each round can also be completed deathmatch style by wiping out the enemy team (indeed, this will usually happen in most cases as each team pushes towards their respective objective)  Occasionally, due to the respectable size and intelligent layout of the maps, there will come situations where there are only one or two players left alive on each team and both teams must aggressively pursue the objective. You've never experienced tension until you have 40 seconds to defuse a bomb and you don't know where the devil who planted it went. You attempt to disarm it while there's still time. You hear footsteps behind you. Your hair trigger reflexes can save you. Will you come out on top?  There are still hundreds, maybe thousands of public Counter strike servers available, and a good number of players to populate them (though many servers are ghost or bot servers also). Most of them (95%) will run some sort of addons and plugins but they install automatically on the fly as needed on your client so you dont have to worry about extra downloads. These addons will range from subtle things that enhance game functions like realtime stats, to comical sound effects (I've heard the 'HEAD SHOT!' callout from Unreal Tournament in CS more than I have from playing any UT game) to absolutely ridiculous and gamechanging, to the leveling Warcraft 3 hero addon where you can get a chain lightning spell XD to being able to deploy a parachute whenever you want to to avoid any fall damage.  It is a bit old, so if that word alone scares you you may want to avoid the original CS (and possibly the newer ones as well, as they play very similarly) but if you enjoyed the Half-Life series (the engine) and you like modern shooters and want to try one with some good pace, try Counter-Strike. Where a game of Call of Duty or the like would typically degenerate into a full on bloodbath where nothing is sacred and everyone is shooting you from behind, Counter Strike has pacing; every round can play out completely different from the last, depending on the tactics used by each team and the route they choose to take towards their objective.   It's far from perfect, but it will always have a special place in my heart. &lt;3  There was a time, when, if you wanted to flashbang your team and hear their cries of anguish, this was pretty much the only game you could do it in.  10/10 for flashbang memories
6241	1	a	One and only. The roots. First love.
6243	1	a	Cel mai tare joc &lt;3 The best game &lt;3
6245	1	a	Cool game, old but good.
6247	1	a	I prefer a preemptive strike, so I start each match by swatting all of my enemies.
6249	1	a	Better than CS:GO .
6251	1	a	best of the best
6253	1	a	
6255	1	a	If you have ten dollars to spare or if you get it in one of the valve bundles or in a humble bundle or something to that extent DEFINITELY check it out. I may only have 75 hours on this as of now but I used to play it all the time before I knew it was on steam. If your a person who doesn't mind graphics but likes counter strike I would definitely buy it because, while I don't necessarily like classic on this version all of the custom maps and game modes make well worth ten dollars. *Alert* A lot of the gun names and the amount of guns is pretty different from CS GO but there are probably guides and once you get past your first hour-ish its fine.
6257	1	a	This game is awesome. Especially CSGO.
6259	1	a	This is a good game that can run on bad computers.
6261	1	a	)))
6263	1	a	There's a lot of potential in this game, Valve please don't leave it, we need your patches. Gaben, please add skins and destroy them cheaters with your almighty power.
6265	1	a	TO many cheats for this childhood game ! :-)
6267	1	a	This game was my childhood this was litteraly the best FPS ever. you should get it on sale its worth it.
6269	1	a	master piece!  one of the best iconic games in fps genre
6271	1	a	Classic game.
6273	1	a	the best game
6275	1	a	Very good game so much mods 8/10 ;) reason not good graphic i know 1999 :) and much ns kids a noobs
6277	1	a	This is the game I grew up on, and it still has active servers! If you needed a hint, there it is. Go buy the game and at least see what old games used to be like :)
6279	1	a	Is Nice game!!!
6281	1	a	10/10
6283	1	a	LIKE OMG THIS GAME IS LIKE ANCIENT. IF YOU STILL PLAY IT â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING KEEEEEL YOURSELF!
6285	1	a	The golden classic. If you haven't played this game I don't know what is wrong with you. No, seriously... just buy this masterpiece and play it. The original Counter-Strike is still better than CS:GO. There, I said it. The player base might not be what it used to be but if you have a game that has around 50 000 active players a month on steam and is over 15 years old at the same time, you have a really great game. The graphics do not hold up to today's standarts in any way shape or form but that is to be expected. Either way the gameplay is still amazing and most of the maps are balanced.
6287	1	a	Better than csgo
6289	1	a	I bought this game because of memories when I was playing CS 1.6 and all I can tell is that this game looks bit different than 1.6 :D but that doesn't matter.    PROS
6291	1	a	Its good but im not really in to it.
6293	1	a	-favourite CS -better than cocaine -lot of hours played uhm..addicted -graphically its not like one of these modern shooters (hahahaa) with the best leet-graphics,but for a 16 years old game its still perfect include the basic sounds! -after 500.000 defused/planted bombs its still funny and it keeps you entertained for tons of hours -a game worth more than it costs -after 16 years I stopped it to play, because at some point u have to say goodbye old times  -old but gold 
6295	1	a	It's a nice game, a nice multiplayer game, you can buy it if you want, very cheap.
6297	1	a	great game
6299	1	a	No R8 revovler, 10/10 would play again.
6301	1	a	Can't beat a classic.
343	0	a	cant even play it because screen for some reson is super sized and i cant adjust it because you cant get into the opitions 
6303	1	a	My childhood fps shooter &lt;3
6305	1	a	Will stay the best tactical multiplayer game for ever. 10/10  BEST GAME EVER.
6307	1	a	This game used to be awesome. But now , everytime I try to play I get redirected to fake servers. I have reinstalled. Formatted my pc 3 times , but nothing bears fruit. I please urge Mr. Dave to look into this matter. I dont know but after the launch of GO these things became frequent. My friends and me are very unhappy and disappointed at this. I want the old game back. Please help , making this game secure , so that this goes on for generation without harrasement by slow hackers. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE. KEEP THE LEGACY GOING.
6309	1	a	Absolutely great! I'm really dissapointed I didn't get this game years ago!
6311	1	a	10/10 better than CS:GO, no knives.
6313	1	a	Cool game.Still from 1999 but still cool.
6315	1	a	No â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.  11/10
6317	1	a	One thing I need to comment on. Why can't I customize a game and play with bots? Besides that this game is a gem obviously. Playing on the italy map led me to buying csgo, and I can't even get bored of it. My gameplay was on another edition not from steam so don't pay attention the gameplay hours.

6347	1	a	After countlessly playing CSGO, Counter Strike original called me for no odd reason. I decided to buy it and wow, the game does lack graphics and resolution, but brings so much memories to almost 4-5 years ago! It's a classic. I hope they could remaster or somehow bring back Counter Strike original so its graphics do get improved and see how different they both looked from year 2000 till today   11/10 :D awesome game, brining back heaps of memories.
6349	1	a	The old â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥!

6375	1	a	The classic that set an entire subgenre of FPS games. I played the beta, and played that for YEARS before buying and installing 1.6. That's when I first got my Steam account. Then I got CS:Source. Then, it was others. Thirty games later, I still love the original CS. I was a member of 76th AD on Day of Defeat, and I regularly hung out on Vir's Pub in Vancouver long after the release of CS:S. There's a reason this game has more hours logged than any other for me (over 1400 hours, at last check); it never gets old. I sometimes have to remember to buy ammo, since CS:S tied ammo to the weapon, but this game was truly my first love in the FPS genre.  Seriously, just get it. It's always good to have the classic. And seriouslyâ€”I only play CS and CS:S in the series; CS:GO's pay-to-win system is not what I look for in a game. Bide your time, build up your funds, and then unleash the fury. It's that simple. No, I'm not good enough to do pro gaming. I'm not even really good enough to make it on the amateur circuit. But I did get good enough to be an even match to my friendsâ€¦ all without paying for deus ex machina.   I don't play WoW for similar reasons: I refuse to pay a monthly fee to play a game. Yes, there are free (libre) servers out there. My stepson runs one. But the point is that if I buy the license to the game, I should be able to play all I want without having to pay a fee. Pay-to-win is arguably worse than pay-to-play; it creates an unbalanced play experience, and I refuse to participate in that.   Bearing that in mind, that's why I love CS and CS:S. It's just you, your skill, and an adversarial challenge. There's no buying your way to victory. I hope Valve can get back to that in future releases.
6377	1	a	This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:  I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over and he didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I don't remember a day when I was so happy like back then. So, the journey started. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a whole experience. Playing public servers and maybe some servers with mods was very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.  I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO, but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games.  I am glad that I lived through the golden era of shooters and if I'd have to rate it, it'd 10/10 ofcourse,
6379	1	a	Counter-Strike is a cool game. I play this game in 2015 and it's still good.
6381	1	a	+
6383	1	a	dont run crack programs you can get vac band i got sow i know
6385	1	a	This is the 'Rosemary's Baby' of video games, a video-offspring of demonic potential...the best multi-player game of 2000, bar none.  A heart-pounding, visceral experience that gets under your skin. The 'just one more round' addiction factor is very high. When you play it properly, with team work that clicks like a well-oiled machine, the game offers a sense of accomplishment and comradery that is simply amazing.
6387	1	a	Be the best, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ the rest
6389	1	a	The best of the best 10/10 :)
6391	1	a	Awesome oldschool Game! In the past i played it over 10k hours and it's just Awesome!

346	0	a	This game was amazing but now it feels really clunky and pointless interms of gameplay. There is a safe way of playing this game and that is to spray like crazy. Sense this game is very old headshots are far to easy to land making sprays all the more cheap, you are litterally being rewarded for being a reckless player.  if you want to get a better feel of Counter-Strike just get Counter Strike: Source. Its pretty much CS but fixed with a better physics, online sync, and better hit detection.  This game doesn't hold up with games today.
6419	1	a	Is My Life !
6421	1	a	The original.
6423	1	a	Great game for that good, proper skilled shooter experience. Not like the new cod's nowadays. Great game that will last for a long time.
6425	1	a	+
6427	1	a	Oldest shooter game. The best game of my childhood.
6429	1	a	Good game, most popular!
6431	1	a	cool
6433	1	a	BEST GAME FROM 2000!
6435	1	a	purty decent
6437	1	a	My kids will play this game until their eyes become raisins... and if they say that Counter Strike 1.6 sucks, they will be grounded until they move out.
6439	1	a	I would like to write a little review for this game and Express their personal opinion. We all know the most popular and everyone's favorite FPS game is Counter Strike 1.6. What is it so good? First of all it's dynamics. The scene, when you get out from behind the corner and clamp in five, watching as their lifeless body falling dead to the ground, is fascinating. Not many will wail my rating for the game 10 out of 10.
6441	1	a	- Joins a game - Gets tons of kills - Checks scoreboard - 50 kills and 2 deaths  10/10, would get a 25.0 KDR again.
6443	1	a	An old classic!!!!!!
6445	1	a	The best game of my childhood. Love it.
6447	1	a	One of the best games ever.
6449	1	a	coolest game ever
6451	1	a	This was once a popular FPS mod for Half-life, a popular game of 1998. I have ever single Counter Strike game including a steamed version of Counter Strike 1.0. But I do not have the Korean version of Counter Strike and CS:GO is mostly because of its toxic community, anyways I give this game a 10/10.
6453	1	a	Old but gold
6455	1	a	^_^
6457	1	a	bring me the old times, thanks
6459	1	a	Good Old times. 
6461	1	a	this game never gets old
6463	1	a	the best game for me
6465	1	a	This is best game ever
6467	1	a	Old games the best :D
6469	1	a	OK!
6471	1	a	Great game. Great hitboxes.
6473	1	a	First game=Death Second game=Death Third Game=I suck at this game.
6475	1	a	Good game, very good. buy it already:)
348	0	a	Dont Buy This Game!  If you can buy the cs pack with all games for like 4 pound then sweet, give it a go, but if your like me and new to playing csgo you are not going to find the original that good.  Yes it would have been good back in the day, but csgo is were its at, and alot more fun, if you like hacking, and people harrasing each other, then play this game.

6493	1	a	This game, this game, this game.  This game is still alive at the moment im writing this.  This game is amazing and should really try it out. I bought a counter-strike: condition zero disc in december 2004.I lost it in 2006,found it in jan 12 2016.Wrote the code that was found in the disc,then i got this game and condition zero and counter strike:condition zero deleted scenes.  When i found this game, i couldn't be more happy in my life.

6541	1	a	bEST OF THE bEST
6543	1	a	Oh , the memories ...
6545	1	a	CS:GO but with less features, more Russians, and graphics comparable to the original Half-Life.
6547	1	a	Counter-Strike is a multiplayer spin-off game to the Half Life franchise. Set in the same universe except focused on the HECU Marines themselves. There is no plot to this game, it's purpose is to establish a fun co-op multiplayer game that allows gamers to either fight it off or team up around the globe. There is a selection of different locations for the areas and different types of game play to create endless possible features wether you play as the marines or the terrorists is all up to you. This game was so successful it established a large fan base and spawn a few sequals. If you want to play a classic online multiplayer, you can't go more classic than this. If you manage to gather some friends who have their own Counter Strike games installed on their PC, then you will be all set.

6633	1	a	)
6635	1	a	It's awesome
6637	1	a	Best game to play if you have a potato. It still is a very fun game despite dated graphics. However, if you have a good computer and can run the newer games, then there isn't much point to playing this one, unless you're like me and enjoy playing older games. The gameplay is rather different from the newer games. For one, this one is much harder. It feels like the first Rainbow Six at times.
6639	1	a	classic counterstrike
6641	1	a	start the game ----------- get into a server---------------first round------all the server starts to say fire in the hole fire in the hole firf rifrifrfirfirifri ------------ the awp scope is made in paint app --------guns are useless sub guns are useless too --------- the game is AWP and m4 and ak-47----- any thing els suck  but still love it 10/10
6643	1	a	Counter-Strike is the best competitve game ever made. Thanks to CS, I traveled many countries around the world and competed against the best players.
6645	1	a	Must have game for a gamer.
6647	1	a	1

6659	1	a	was fun when it first came out, still fun in 2016.
6661	1	a	::))
355	0	a	People still play this game? I was forced to buy it due to ex g/f. She was actually a professional, as in got paid, counter-strike player.
6663	1	a	need more chickens
6665	1	a	Yes!! awesome, best childhood memories. 10 years and still playing.
356	0	a	this game is sh*t literaly. Most of the servers are ok but when you shoot your gun you really cant tell where your bullets are landing after that. Also the registration is crap as well. Dont buy this game unless you want to get sh*tted on by a bunch of perubian butt pirates who cant afford anything or run anything else besides this terrible game.
6667	1	a	CS 1.6, the best game of all time. You should rather grab one copy of a new CS:GO game.
6669	1	a	Fun game to cheat in
357	0	a	Osm Loved To play :)
6671	1	a	I love this game :v
6673	1	a	One of the best game ever, i will play this in 50 years to!
6675	1	a	It's just awesome :D
6677	1	a	The game functions just like half-life with a few twists. Realy good game but CS:GO better. This game still has players today if your intrested in purchasing this game.
6679	1	a	.
6681	1	a	This is always going to be a great game in the eyes of CS fans
6683	1	a	The best!!!!

6703	1	a	Great graphics... â¤
6705	1	a	Fun shooter !
6707	1	a	Great game, it was originally a mod for half-life 1 but valve picked it up and what a great choice that was, it has now become one of the most successful PC series to date with CS:GO being one of the most played PC games ever
6709	1	a	Nice game !
6711	1	a	Old School...
6713	1	a	.,,..
6715	1	a	Great game, better than all others Couter-Strike series. CLASSIC.
6717	1	a	Great game, extremely entertaining. 5/5
6719	1	a	Classic FPS!
6721	1	a	â˜ºâ™¥.â™¥â˜ºâ™¥.â™¥â˜ºâ™¥.â™¥â˜ºâ™¥.â™¥â˜ºâ™¥.â™¥â˜º
6723	1	a	Wow this game was not even the smallest bit â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
6725	1	a	Best Game Ever Played! &lt;3
6727	1	a	  fire in the hole
6729	1	a	  CS All the best of all time
6731	1	a	Old But Good =D I Like It
6733	1	a	All I can say is WOW! Has anyone tried this game? It's an FPS game but it's so sweet! Just shoot um in the face mang!
6735	1	a	great game mate
6737	1	a	its good yes
6739	1	a	Good old game. It can be used (by servers) as 'sandbox' for creating FirstPersonShooter prototypes (which does not work in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive). It has simple mechanics which you can learn in few seconds and you can keep getting better (for example with bunny hop). There is only one big problem - cheaters. But it can be solved by playing only on VAC secured servers.
6741	1	a	Tbh I have spent more time in De_dust2 Compairing with my Parents :D now you know how much I love this game
6743	1	a	Mm need some changes ?
6745	1	a	Simply the best FPS game ever, no matter how good are the graphics nowadays, this one still own them in gameplay + teamplay
6747	1	a	Nothing will ever beat the original.
6749	1	a	10/10 best game. consumed my lief 10/10 ign
6751	1	a	Cool game :D
6753	1	a	Athough this isn't my first counter strike game nor my favorite, I still get this huge sense of nostalgia towards it. That late 90's FPS feel and the gritty nature of a low-budget mod gives the game it's charm.   Some things have not aged well, such as a search bar for server and the lack of customization options for your crosshair; i dunno, maybe I'm just spoiled.   This is probably the most difficult in the series for newcomers to get used to, but once you get the hand of the often clunkey controls and movement, it'll be an enjoyable experience.  
6755	1	a	Played it a bit. It's ok!
6757	1	a	the classic
6759	1	a	The best of all time, and cheap also :) 5/5
6761	1	a	A real classic from the 90s, this game is still MUCH better than newer titles, like Call of Duty and Battlefield.
6763	1	a	Definitely the best FPS hands down!
6765	1	a	BEST GAME!
6767	1	a	10/10
6769	1	a	This game is awesome! I was playing this game when i was younger and i really enjoyed it! I really recommend this game to try out! I know this game is old but good!
6771	1	a	Old great game, with a better story then pocahontas.
6773	1	a	Although the game is more than 16 years old, it is still a very nice game and many people play it.I strongly recommend buying it.
6775	1	a	I really love this game. The best Lan Game ever. I love it since 1999.
6777	1	a	very fun game! have so much memories from this game and will never forget &lt;3
6779	1	a	Haven't played too much of this, but I can see why alot of gamers were hooken on this for years and still occasionally come back to it. Its completely worth it.
6781	1	a	Best shooter ,ever !
6783	1	a	The best one :) The beginning
6785	1	a	  Nice and fun!!! :)
6787	1	a	192.168.1.1:27020
6789	1	a	Trumps president.... Well you know how they say, Only a 100 nukes needed and you can cause a nuclear winter causing mass famin, have fun sleeping this week
6791	1	a	Had this game as a kid alongside Half Life without internet connection and no bots. Basically had nothing to do with it except roaming around.
6793	1	a	Better than GO
6795	1	a	Very nice game ma friends, you can shoot peiopple and duck veri nice, jumping is aLLso avibiible very nice. i give 5 out of 4 stars tri it out
6797	1	a	CS is love,CS is life. 
6799	1	a	the best shooter the history of PC
6801	1	a	Where to begin? I was fortunate to be there at the beginning.   I downloaded Counter-Strike, the Half-Life mod, in August 1999 during Beta 3 after a kid at school recommended it. My group of friends fell in love.  Hostage and VIP missions were my preference, with Militia, 747 and Oilrig absolute favorites.   Sixteen years later, here I am, still playing the series. We may have left the first game behind, but the memories stay with me always.
6803	1	a	      Question   Answer       Can i spray   ( Í¡Â° ÍœÊ– Í¡Â°) yes if your a girl( Í¡Â° ÍœÊ– Í¡Â°)       Curry   Yes 100% the curry was magical       Should you buy this game   not really get cs source     
6805	1	a	!!!
6807	1	a	the best game *_* i love it so much
6809	1	a	10/10
6811	1	a	There's no need to be an expert in FPS to know this game. It's a classic that marks a generation of online gaming and competetive events that still last to date.
6813	1	a	Old School â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ &lt;3 
6815	1	a	Great game, even though its graphics are not the best, gameplay is what most matters here
6817	1	a	Absolutely one of the best fps games i've played. People still talk that CS 1.6 (Counter Strike) died, it is a lie: it still standing up. Of course, is not a swarm of people who still play, but some still play the game.
6819	1	a	This is in my opinion one of the best games ever to exist in history of video games. This game is balanced as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ compared to cs go. This game is a lot more fun and requires skill and dedication and not luck. 10 / 10 This game gave birth to legends we got today such as GeT_RiGhT, F0rest and Neo!
6821	1	a	Why i cant refund this game I purchased accently 
6823	1	a	I like how this makes me feel like I'm permanently in S.W.A.T and can't get out. 9/10
6825	1	a	This game is so good
6827	1	a	Its is an amazing game really enjoyable! it is also fun playing this with friends! 10/10 RECCOMEND
6829	1	a	  The best fps game in the world.

6839	1	a	Awesome game,must buy it!
6841	1	a	One of the most played FPS games ever made, with thriving scenes surrounding pretty much all of its versions. Worth checking out for its competitive scene alone, this game set the bar for all tactical shooters to come.
6843	1	a	  Best will always be the Best *-* Like they say Old but Gold ^^
6845	1	a	This is a great game that really stood the test of time. It's hitscan can even been seen as better than cs go. The shooting is smooth

7105	1	a	Old but gold!  This game was the best experience in my past. It won many awards and was the world number one in online gaming. I played it over ten years in many clans and 5on5 teams, in few leagues and many cups.  My best experience was the 6 months in Electronic Sports League Pro Series 2005 and in Electronic Sports League World Cyber Games 2005 Qualifiers.  This old game never had so many cheaters and players under 13 as the new one Counter-Strike: Global Offensive...  I miss the gold old time!
7107	1	a	Still the best Counter strike on Steam ;)
7109	1	a	One of the best fps ever
7111	1	a	Hey, that's pretty good. This game has stood the test of time and is still one of the most popular and well-known games.
7113	1	a	I love this game, my childhood
7115	1	a	You wanted to know what your big brother did in your old pc? Did he watch porn all day like you? did he play something?  This is the answer 
7117	1	a	The best multi-player game of 2000, bar none.
7119	1	a	Still the best game in the series.
7121	1	a	Why are you even reading these reviews, you already know what this is and waht it's like...
7123	1	a	Nice game
7125	1	a	Counter-Strike 1.6 what an awsome game! This is so nostalgic! If you are looking for better graphics go for Counter-Strike - Global Offensive.  10/10 (for the nostalgic)
7127	1	a	ABSOLUTELY BETTER THEN NERFED CS GO.ABSOLUTELY I PLAY CS FOR 11 YEARS AND I GUESS EVERYBODY WILL SAY RECOIL CONTROL WAS BETTER IN CS 1.6 THAN IS CS GO RIGHT NOW.â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ CS GO.6 HITS -98 WITH â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING SILENCER ARE U â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING KIDDING ME
7129	1	a	This game is pretty much just as good as Counter Strike Source just with older and outdated graphics and sound. You can play Counter Strike 1.6 with bots by getting Podbot MM:  http://podbotmm.bots-united.com/main_pb_page/index.htm  . A great game!
7131	1	a	HOW TO PLAY COMPETITIVE IN COUNTER STRIKE 1.6
7133	1	a	In a nutshell: 10/10 - Really good game for being what it is, an old classic.  What is Counter-Strike? - This is basically SWAT team simulator 2000, it's a pretty competitive 5v5 FPS shooter where you must stop the terrorists from a range of objectives, such as rescuing hostages, defusing bombs or killing terrorists before they plant their bomb, even escort missions where you must escort a buddy to a helicopter! As terrorists your goal is to well, kill the Counter-Terrorists, to put it bluntly.  Will it Run on my Computer? - Considering my cheap Lenovo G580 with integrated graphics can handle this at 60fps, unless you use a really outdated PC (like, a computer made before 3D games were commonplace) I'm sure your fine.  Parent's Guide - I'd say FPS games are generally a no-no for parents who care about what their children play, and actually, this game, if you go into settings and turn blood off, its actually not too bad, I'd say 13+ is appropriate.  Graphics - (Note: This game was released in 2000, excuse what is terrible graphics nowadays), pretty good graphics, all the characters are in pretty good detail and the guns look nice and pretty realistic-looking.   Gameplay - I will say, it's quite fun, but I will tell you, this is a game meant to be played with friends or meant to be played with players who are good at teamwork, your entire team could lose simply from one player on your team not going with your team's plans.  Is it Worth The Price? - Yes, absolutely, if you want to see where CS:GO started, get it for sure!
7135	1	a	This game is still no.1
7137	1	a	First time I've played this game was on 2008 or so.. I still remember how excited I was playing this game for hours each day.. Even if I don't have many hours of Counter-Strike on Steam, I played it Non_Steam Mode. I recommend this game to any person who like shooting games! ^^

7271	1	a	game even if not played by as many people as before (not played at tournaments, and releasing 'updated' version of it) still has this something, that surely would catch eyes of many people interested in that sort of games. dynamic gameplay and not too bad graphic are for sure advantages of cs 1.6

7427	1	a	The one true CS.
7429	1	a	play hard go pro!!!!
7431	1	a	Why did it update ?
7433	1	a	In the '80s my tape-mate Richard D. Reynalds disappeared down my extra 8-track speakers clutching opiate presciptions and blues mixtapes. I remembered his parting words: 'FUc k John Coltrane's Newphew -- I'd tear my Pseudo Goldfish in that Flyinglotus-eater. Take my Taxi-card, I'm off.' But three avenues deep, I regarded his winter jackettas nothing more than a Sony stance. My first-draft redeemer is a real VB! Wow!!   And don't pose me a steam, you neglector Flying Aphex! True Macho  What did we teach?ageispolis is famous for its slow-burning ziggurat. Check it, mountain-chair gig at 2!!! 
7435	1	a	It truly was one of the best first person shooter games at the time. I still play it to me graphics dont matter, the playing of the game matters.
7437	1	a	The best
7439	1	a	This is the best game ever made. EVER.  
7441	1	a	The best FPS ever!
7443	1	a	Hands down the best multiplayer FPS ever. Even 12 years after its official 1.0 release, its still the most played action game online. While other big online multiplayer FPS's have come on gone with a lot of fanfair(i.e. Battlefield 1942, COD 2, Battlefield 2, UT 2004, Counter-Strike:Source, Quake Live, COD 4, etc etc etc) this game has remained a constant favorite in E-Sports and amonst FPS fans. Lets hope CS:GO can continue the CS tradition of teamplay, great maps, competitivness, and unmatched gunplay. LONG LIVE CS!
7445	1	a	Undying legend....that's it..

7513	1	a	I strongly recommend this game. Awesome graphics, cool modes at very cheap price $ . And one of the best multiplayer game i've ever played
7515	1	a	This is most skillfull game!
7517	1	a	We all know Counter-Strike, and we all played it at least once. We all love it, and we all still play it nowadays. Great, fun, working on any PC, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ or new gen. Great game.
7519	1	a	Brilliant gameplay, lots of options, graphics are very good for a game that's old and made 1st November 2000. One of the best first-person shooter games aroung it's time 10 years after Half-Life.
7521	1	a	Why not buy it? Its classic, it requires low requirements, and more importantly, its FUN! People who are new to this may be frustrated when playing this but eventually when you understand how the game works you will be good at it. Its always good to have games like this that has low requirements, so if you go play on your friends pc or if you just simply want to play this, i can pretty much guarantee that this game should work well and will not WASTE your time. In fact, it'll KILL time if you are bored. Just have to get yourself hooked up into this and you are all good. Just be sure to also find good servers, mostly with alot of people haha! So, give this game a try!
7523	1	a	Fun times in the good old days.
7525	1	a	This game is the best Counter Strike game EVER!

7539	1	a	Counter-Strike it's really amazing, but today really it's bad we can't play good, just before are good. Server are Sh~# PPL are Sh%$ really it's BAD  People Play free, Play Clean, Play to your mode, and OFF HACK, OFF cheating , OFF Scripting, OFF ALL    Play Fun :)
7541	1	a	Yes , this is awsome game
7543	1	a	Play this game now!  Join us!
7545	1	a	Why should I even recommend this game to anyone new to this if they get their asses kicked by the real Counter-Strike professionals who have been playing this little bad boy since it was released. I think they're the only ones who actually play this game anymore. It's not even played in many e-Sports tournaments anymore since there are newer games out there (sad tho').
7547	1	a	all time favourite game till this day.

7561	1	a	:)
7563	1	a	The counter strike 1.6 game can't be quit. Easy to get used to the people so that he is unable to switch to CS: S, or CS: GO. Maybe the reason I think my favorite FPS game.
7565	1	a	For OldSchools!
7567	1	a	Play this game
7569	1	a	This game will never get old!
7571	1	a	An amazing classic! It excels from killing zombies with a violin to flying around a knife map using a Pidgeot!
7573	1	a	EPIC Game Better than all other fps games exept CSGO but If you dont care about graphics and love the competitive scene then play this game :)
7575	1	a	bad file consistency a rha h cnt play :/
7577	1	a	:)
7579	1	a	My First Counter-Strike game if my memory doesnt fail. Must have ha hours of fun with it!
7581	1	a	Pretty much the best game ever. period.
7583	1	a	Its a great game first version of counterstrike and the best of them all, 1,6 ftw pro game
7585	1	a	Most fun i've ever had playing an fps game on pc. So much better than call of duty, and probably has better graphics too.
7587	1	a	Still the master of all tactical shooters out there! &lt;3
7589	1	a	Always in my heart. An all time classic that I can never forget. I still love to play the eagle catch the chicken on de_dust 2. This game is just FUN! I don't give a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ about the graphics but this is better than all of the other.
7591	1	a	Best FPS game ever! Legendary... a lot of fun!

7613	1	a	CONNECT 46.174.50.29:27211
7615	1	a	Best online Shooter ive played also because you can mod it for fun. This game takes more skill than a multitude of other games and for anyone to ever miss out on this game is doing a complete disservice to onesself note to get the original onscreen multiplayer skins set the game models to not be HD in the video options menu
7617	1	a	best game ever ctreated (Y)
7619	1	a	The original game that started it all.   Innovative, challenging, and teambased multiplayer.  It takes years to master, but once you do, it's an amazing feeling.  9/10
7621	1	a	Fun game , but outdated !
7623	1	a	I Love it...!!!
7625	1	a	BEST GAME TheDoctorE

7631	1	a	cs is the best
7633	1	a	If your reading this, that means you have a steam account. Which means there's no reason you shouldn't have this game in your library already.   Btw dont waste your time with CS Zero
7635	1	a	Cs for life
7637	1	a	Great game that spawned a great franchise
7639	1	a	What are you waiting for!! Go Play!!

7655	1	a	great game so fun get it if u love cs and want to see what the first is like
7657	1	a	The grandfather of all modern First Person Shooters!  This is the game where i learned the fundamentals to being a good team player.
7659	1	a	Very cool game. Lately the book club has been trying to learn to communicate with Mexicans and Spanish people so this game really opened a new world for us, letting us dive into the daily lives of a Mexicano and their struggles in the virtual world of Counter Strike. I will be recommending this to my book club and spanish class.
7661	1	a	
7663	1	a	What can I say. The game that made competitive FPS what it is today!
7665	1	a	Long played counter :) what to say just CS !
7667	1	a	this is the best game i have ever played :p lol
7669	1	a	olldd but golldd the best game ever!!!!
7671	1	a	For some reason it does not work on my fresh 13.04 ubuntu installation with wine. When I want to join ANY cs server I get the message, that blabla map is not  correct.
7673	1	a	Very nice game :)
7675	1	a	Best game of all time!
7677	1	a	Movements much more better than the new fancy schmancy CS:GO movement!
7679	1	a	Why are yo playing a game over a decade old?
7681	1	a	It is and always will be the best and most addictive multiplayer game ever created!
7683	1	a	For the love of god, let a newbie at least get a few kills before headshotting him with the pistol from a few miles away...sheesh...
7685	1	a	The best game ever!
7687	1	a	One of the most played and known games in the world. You can't get bored of this game. Really recommand it.
7689	1	a	=]

7719	1	a	COD IS JUST A BETTER VERSION LOL
7721	1	a	classic best game
7723	1	a	BEST Shooter I've ever played. Tested by millions of people. It left only good feelings
7725	1	a	....
7727	1	a	If you are not into achievements, unlocks, stats and all that bs then this is the best fps out there to date. Pure tactics and aim skills are what matters.  Too bad it's been dropped from esports and overtaken by GO and it's awesome weapon skins, and soon to be TF2 hats. 
7729	1	a	coooool and awesome game! worth the money!
7731	1	a	fun fps but there is a high learning curve. Suprisingly fun after 15 years.
7733	1	a	.
7735	1	a	best of the best.
7737	1	a	This game is a must buy. If you don't care about graphics and such, this game is a gem. The community is pretty.. died. Atleast the competitive community. Anyways, this game is a must buy!
7739	1	a	Ruined my life. Five Stars.
7741	1	a	The best
7743	1	a	Played from February 2000 - September 2004.  The one that started it all. The original.  G.O.A.T.
7745	1	a	nice best game of the world &lt;3
7747	1	a	Best fps Game ever known
7749	1	a	It's an oldschool classic!
7751	1	a	de_dust is still a blast after all these years. The game runs well even on laptops!
7753	1	a	I stil play this game today its that good, anyone who dont have this game should get it immediately!
7755	1	a	play this its badass
7757	1	a	This game is really good ;)
7759	1	a	Most Addicting FPS of all time
7761	1	a	old school game :)
7763	1	a	Steam has been born on this game, few years later still one of the best FPS game n ofc graphic doesnt matter in this case.
7765	1	a	ok im not amazing at this game but it the best out of all of them. i think it takes A LOT pratice to get decent lol well to me im not great but if you got a couple of friends, hey might as well play this game
7767	1	a	Buy CS:GO instead of this  its a good game tho
7769	1	a	Really good tactical game, balanced and very fun to play, an old but gold. Get it free by reediming Half-Life 1 retail version's code.
7771	1	a	Really good game for its time! if you have a time machine, go back in time when it was popular and buy it!
7773	1	a	SUPER COOL GAME
7775	1	a	Love this game....
7777	1	a	Very Good Game Like It :)
7779	1	a	Awesome Game! If you don't have it, you should!
7781	1	a	cs 1.6 forever!!
7783	1	a	my beast game &lt;3
7785	1	a	Addicted &lt;3
7787	1	a	Counter-Strike has always been the best FPS. Global Offensive goes back to the roots and Is a great game for anyone.
7789	1	a	arhhhhhhhhhhhhh best game ever
7791	1	a	Game that makes you skilled.
7793	1	a	Revolutionized FPS gaming &amp; pretty much made it what it is today. Literally was the greatest FPS games back in the day.
7795	1	a	steam, wtf... cd update screw my fps ... really? why? al least an answer...
7797	1	a	.....
7799	1	a	Why can't I run Counter Strike 1.6? It's running half-life and gives me some kind of error message, and then I press OK on that, and it closes down...WHAT THE HELL?!
7801	1	a	THIS UPDATE SUCKS ON STEAM.NOT LAUNCH CS 1.6
7803	1	a	it has stopped working , giving an error library 4 not found.. it was running fine till date and now suddenly its not -_-
7805	1	a	Some stupid update, cannot even load the game, what is this crap? I've been playing it for 1 year and no problems, now i just done this update and i cannot even load it? what is this
7807	1	a	cs 1.6 is crashing after the update... please fix asap!
7809	1	a	what's wrong with counter strike ? if i want to play it's says 'couldn't load library'
7811	1	a	0/5
7813	1	a	You will hardly find a better FPS game.
7815	1	a	really good game guys i recommend it.
7817	1	a	Great!
7819	1	a	Hello, my name is Jesus, I will now proclaim that this gaime is ok. Have fun in life cya in heaven byebye pls no coperino pasterino

7825	1	a	This is what got me into FPS  with my pentium 3 750 mhz, 128 gb ram, geforce mx 32 mb video card...  ahhh the good old days
7827	1	a	^_^
7829	1	a	I would definitely recommend this game for Counter-Strike or FPS players.
7831	1	a	best game of counter strike by far nothing ever compares to it
7833	1	a	Great game, most time plaing this :P
7835	1	a	the mother and father of all fps games!
7837	1	a	Great Game! Its Old But Worth Buying!!
7839	1	a	Well I guess since I have 117 hours clocked into this game *cough cough* steam bug *cough cough* I am obligated to write a review for this game. So this game is most definetly timeless as it is basically super smash bros melee to Counter-Strike:Source/Counter-Strike Global Offensive's super smash bros brawl. This game is unique as when you die you don't respawn until the next round meaning that your team can lose by having all of it's members die. As well, you need to buy your weapons or take them from the bodies of your enemies instead of just finding them scattered across the battlefield like other games of it's time did. Today the game can seem a bit outdated with a lack of ragdoll physics making aerial deaths look weird and unnatural as well as the obvious outdated graphics which can be 'fixed' with a hd patch that just looks weird and unnatural compaired to games made at the time of the patch's creation (2003). Overall I would recommend this game if you buy the retail copy or if they fixed the bug that is the only reason why I have logged 117 hours into the game.
7841	1	a	i love it...awesome game...play hard go pro....:P
7843	1	a	NU IMI MAI MERGE COUNTER STRIKE CS 1.6 INTRU IN JOC SI IMI APARE HALF LIVE MA POATE AJUTA CINEVA?
7845	1	a	:)
7847	1	a	CANT PLAY GAME COUNTER STRIKE PLZZZ HELP FATAL ERROR :(
7849	1	a	:)
7851	1	a	Its really a one of the fabulous game i have ever played
7853	1	a	This is the OG game. #Classic. #Oldschool. The godfather of FPS shooters. There's a reason why it still has a strong playerbase, even stronger than it's successor CS:Source. Even with CS:GO out, it still has a healthy number of players. The gameplay and balance is still unrivaled. This was the platform Valve used to become the powerhouse it is today. Highly recommend even in 2014.
7855	1	a	Very Nice Game :) !
7857	1	a	Good old game , Altough its old , we still love it , and we still play it. Its counter stike :D ! Give a thumbs up if you agree with me
7859	1	a	This game is fkin awesum. Just bought it and already hav 4 hrs on it &gt;:). its addicting dudes
7861	1	a	greaqt games for the nancys
7863	1	a	I can't stop playing that !
7865	1	a	the best game in EU
7867	1	a	This game is such an original classic, its graphics were ahead of its time back in 2000 and still dont look that bad, the gameplay is what that makes this game such a hit, the gameplay is straight to the point for a shooter. The gamemodes are addictive and i think all of them are just as good as the other
7869	1	a	why it! wruth me : ''failed to initazile authentication interface. Exiting... ''
7871	1	a	It is impossible to play this.  Gl if you try, I even tried noob servers and still got owned.  Any Fps looks like an EZ pz game compared to Counterstrike.
7873	1	a	The Classic Counter Strike , this is the old â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥!
7875	1	a	.
7877	1	a	this game although old still is very good game and it takes actrually some skill in it to 
7879	1	a	This is Great Game   Let's play Togeter
7881	1	a	what can i say ? most played fps ever with a reason
7883	1	a	If you want to learn spanish,russian,swedish language play this game.
7885	1	a	i remeber when this was a free Mod for half-life
7887	1	a	cs 1.6 one of the best and addictive fps games ever made
7889	1	a	Great
7891	1	a	.
7893	1	a	the best online multiplay action game
7895	1	a	Actually retired
7897	1	a	If i could find out how to play this game it would be awesome i click on cs and then i see a black screen and then steam main menu is there ? 
7899	1	a	cs 1.6 4ever !
7901	1	a	Very fun game, graphics are disappointing and just not nice, I personally live in Israel, Israel has a lot of multiplayer servers and their sons loads admit most enjoyable so it makes up for the graphics ...  Also has the option to fight against bots you can practice with it or simply pass the time, I wish there was such a nice single player.  So in short, if you are looking for a game with many Indians, multiplayer servers, easy and fun then this is the game for you!
7903	1	a	Have been playing since 6.5 and there are still 12 year olds flaming me in voicechat 10/10 for tryhard authenticity
7905	1	a	You know, I don't mind this game.
7907	1	a	:)
7909	1	a	the GOAT.

7919	1	a	One of the best mods ever became such a legendary game!

7961	1	a	Classic superb multyplayer game, But till STEAM the hot air is out. Is it the servers? the players? The stupid fan-mods? I donÂ´t know....
7963	1	a	:)
7965	1	a	Classic.
7967	1	a	this game prove that graphic dosen't matter!!! Game play matter!!!!
7969	1	a	bes game of the world
7971	1	a	Working on Debian as a charm, even with Xorg's radeon driver! :-)
7973	1	a	Great game :D
7975	1	a	the game speaks for its self ! ONE OV THE ALLTIME BEST FPS GAMES ON THE PLANET #FACT!  this was the game that got me in to pc gaming meny yrs ago.
7977	1	a	Jucam Un Ce Se :)? 
7979	1	a	;)
7981	1	a	addictive! I'm going to flunk all of my classes!
7983	1	a	Here we are 14 years after the game Relase.... And tull this very they i still pick up the game and play hours a day. For 9 dollers this games is a great buy.
7985	1	a	A clasic. Tied with Source as the best game of all time.
7987	1	a	Fun game. Worth the buy.
7989	1	a	Probably the best shooter ever made (and it will probably stay that way). This game literally changed the way how shooter games are today. Well done Valve, well done !
7991	1	a	Nice game!
7993	1	a	Nice game))
7995	1	a	This game started the FPS franchise. Well technically it didn't, but it started it for me dammit.
7997	1	a	:)
7999	1	a	Awesome to the max =]
8001	1	a	this game is a legend! CS 1.6 For Life!
8003	1	a	The Granddaddy of all FPS Multiplayer Games, CS is unapolgetic and based on skill alone! Its a game that not afraid make you feel like you really suck.....but you keep coming back for more everytime!
8005	1	a	The best on the world
8007	1	a	This was, is and will be the most popular First Person Shot game ever. I rly dont like the new one GO version of Counter Strike. This is legengary game and it will be active and popular for many years from now on.
8009	1	a	This game played a huge role in my childhood :D Still the best fps for competitive play, but unfortunately steam ruined this game with the latest updates :(
8011	1	a	There's nothing about Counter-Strike 1.6 that hasn't be said already, the game will always remain flawless in many gamers eyes throughout the world. Tactiacl shooter at its finest, Cs 1.6 offers not only perfectly balanced matches and good maps but intense sneaking, real quick scoping, amazing weaponry, strategies and SO much more! It is the easiest game to just pick up and play, and it would totaly fit in 'Things any human beings should try atleast once.' list.

8059	1	a	Who can not love the good old classic Counter-Strike? I played this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ religiously when I was younger, had some good times. The game has gotten pretty outdated, and there's large traces of hacker â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s. Regardless, still a monumentally epic game.
8061	1	a	I will â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing kill myself if I end up playing it

8143	1	a	best game  i playing cs from 2007
8145	1	a	Good Game!!! Epic!
8147	1	a	loshedo
8149	1	a	awesome game love it best in the whole world
8151	1	a	classic but great
8153	1	a	classic fps game, everyone knowing this game 'Counter-Strike' since 2000 until now this game still famous !!!
8155	1	a	classic ;D
8157	1	a	Still good after all these years
8159	1	a	Old School Awesome!
8161	1	a	Still the game that has had it's share in building the foundation of multiplayer gameplay. Really one of the first games which demanded tactical gameplay, good aim and sometimes a bit of luck to be victorious.  Though the community is not that big anymore, you should ask yourself: 'Can you really call yourself a gamer if you haven't played counterstrike?'
8163	1	a	Really good one.
8165	1	a	cs 1.6 = Addiction &lt;3
8167	1	a	Grande counter!!!!
8169	1	a	Best FPS game, its so awesome get it its totally worth it
8171	1	a	Old game is gold game :D
8173	1	a	love it&lt;3
8175	1	a	as
8177	1	a	If you need to be told what this game is, I'd prefer it if you weren't on my team in any FPS, ever.
8179	1	a	still a awesome game!!!!!!!!
8181	1	a	One of the greatest games ever made. Not active now, but in its prime this game was amazing.
8183	1	a	This game is just awesome!
8185	1	a	:)
8187	1	a	Counter Strike 1.6 â™¥  What else their is to say?
8189	1	a	This game is one of the best games i have ever played!!!!
8191	1	a	The multiplayer FPS that started it all. Might be a old game, but its better than COD, also, even though the graphics are â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, that doesnt mean the game is. Instead of picking your loadout, you get in-game money to buy weapons from a menu. There are no attachments to the weapons. There isnt THAT much to say, but its still very good. Final Verdict 10/10 Classic.
8193	1	a	Either everyone uses Aimbots or I really suck. Probably the second one.
8195	1	a	Time proven classic that will always be most fun us born in 80' last century !!!
8197	1	a	Tactical and Strategic game and a lot of team work :) Nice game...... I Love to play CS 1.6 every time I open steam. n1 :D
8199	1	a	.
8201	1	a	pretty good
8203	1	a	Still ages well in many ways. In addition, it's probably the only GoldSrc game that still has players on it, and for good reason. CS's game mechanics are tried and true, and they still hold up despite two sequels and almost two decades. While CS: GO is my personal favorite, CS 1.6 is still damn fun, and given that it's an older game, you can play it on literally anything nowadays. There's a single-player mode with bots, perfect for newbies or lone wolves, but make sure you've practiced before hopping online, or you'll get destroyed. tl;dr you can't go wrong with this game.
8205	1	a	Ah, the one and only CS 1.6.....so many memories here. This game was my childhood. Big YES.
8207	1	a	-_-
8209	1	a	A game of skill. Master this game and you'll be able to dominate in any other FPS games.
8211	1	a	The game that started it all (well, almost)... simply a classic
8213	1	a	Well, this is the one that basically started it all... An entertaining game that despite being old, its gold!  Cheap and a whole lot of fun.
8215	1	a	The best oldschool tactic Shooter :P
8217	1	a	Get the complete pack when it's on sale and you can play some fun maps with your friends !
8219	1	a	+1
8221	1	a	This game as its released a long time ago, but it still carries the compitive sense, unlike the new versions of counter strike (source and Go), playing this game is fun and i think it would remain as a favourite game as much as i play anymore games.
8223	1	a	revolutionized first person shooters
8225	1	a	Old.
8227	1	a	Simple mechanics, fun community, old but gold!
8229	1	a	Old is Gold :D 
8231	1	a	Best online shooter of last years, old but damn good
8233	1	a	a very good game 
8235	1	a	!
8237	1	a	a no-â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t old shooter that is actually fun to play. Get it.
8239	1	a	It doesn't need to be recommended.
8241	1	a	This is the best game ever!!
8243	1	a	The most competitive game ever.
8245	1	a	I like this game.
8247	1	a	#1
8249	1	a	Very Good game the Best!
8251	1	a	Good Games!!!!
8253	1	a	Classic game. Great shooter even today! 7/10
8255	1	a	1 of the best classic games
8257	1	a	An amazing old shooter that is really great fun with friends after you get some experience.
8259	1	a	Just the best
8261	1	a	Since 2002,since it appeard in Romania,it's the greatest and the funnest game i've ever played.
8263	1	a	old is gold
8265	1	a	. 
8267	1	a	Best Classic Action Shooter Ever Was Created!
8269	1	a	Very good game, the movement is fantastic is fantastic.
8271	1	a	è¶…å¥½çŽ©!!!  It's the best online game I played, it can make joy for you and your friends, also you can play with your friends. When all the players die, you are lonely, you have to fight for another enemies, all the teammate put the hopes on yourself, and you will never forget that feels!
8273	1	a	Great game
8275	1	a	Simply the best online FPS video game out there.
8277	1	a	10/10
8279	1	a	Still the greatest shooter of all times
8281	1	a	da grafics r bad but dis game is still good
8283	1	a	the best
8285	1	a	Ehh, its ok I guess
8287	1	a	its Awesome
8289	1	a	You can also play ping only at the beginning of a great
8291	1	a	This is one my favorite games of all time. Everybody should play this game
8293	1	a	Just 4 statistics ! =D There's not too much to say, epic game will never die .
8295	1	a	good for players looking for a good fps starter
8297	1	a	Classic CS (Counter-Strike) never gets old, Ka_ maps were the best game type for me, loved round after round dodging blade swings and countering with a sweet headshot, no game mode more tense than Knife Arena, getting stormed at by several opposing team members hungry for frags, using all skill and wit at a 5:1 ratio and coming out victor.. EPIC!
8299	1	a	The team based multiplayer FPS game that started it all, in my opinion. Classic game.
8301	1	a	the beest &lt;3
8303	1	a	cs 1.6 is probably the best yet team based fps game, go is a step up from source but its a very debatable topic that it is AS good as 1.6. Definately not better though.
8305	1	a	Good game!! Very nice!!
8307	1	a	I really like the game, but I couldnâ€™t find the stupid cake.
8309	1	a	A very good game!
8311	1	a	A game when you can play with you best friends :)
8313	1	a	.....
8315	1	a	Counter -Strike is a great FPS simply about terrorists doing things like bombing supplies or keeping people hostage while the Counter-Terrorist try to defuse the bombs or save the hostages. This game has many great mods and maps that make it fun to come back to. No wonder this game used to be the world's number 1 online action game. If that isn't enough you get Counter-Strike: Condition Zero with it. I would give this game a 9 out of 10.
8317	1	a	filete la wia !
8319	1	a	:#
8321	1	a	This game is legendary HANDS DOWN
8323	1	a	.

8337	1	a	The best shooter. Ð¯ Ð¾Ñ‚Ð²ÐµÑ‡Ð°ÑŽ =)
8339	1	a	PlayHardGoPro
8341	1	a	The Most Aggressive, Awesome,Shooter That dated back then when it was made.It Was the best shooter ever since Halo Combat Evolved Came Out. And It's still popular today.So I,personally think you should buy it.It's Only 10.00,And then,if you have kids let them play it when there older,And then let their kids,kids play it,And so on and so on... So Really Buy This Game To Experience What The Gameplay Feels Like.

8397	1	a	'In D2 camping in T spawn with awp is so 2005...'
8399	1	a	This game was saved because of the AMX Mod X scripting, otherwise I believe it would have been dead years ago.
8401	1	a	An abslutly amazeing millitary team based tatical shooter. This is a great game for LAN parties and team vs team games. Also very fun to just play yourself online. 9.3/10
8403	1	a	Good for netbooks.
8405	1	a	In the beginning, there was Counter-strike. Classic tactical team-based shooter.
8407	1	a	My first love.   This game made me to the gamer i am today. Everyone will agree that Counter-Strike was and still is that awesome uncle of Fps.  9.5/10
8409	1	a	Pretty much set the bar for modern day FPS
8411	1	a	I spent 10 years playing this game. What more can be said?
8413	1	a	nothing can beat Cs
8415	1	a	Classic game very fun.. everyone should own this game 
8417	1	a	Recomended!
8419	1	a	Easily the best American Football game I've ever played
8421	1	a	bomb has been planted , go go go  Hehe The best counter strike to play with , The newer ones may have new features and better graphics but this the version to start counter strike gaming with , Extremely simple to get used to the mechanics and well balanced .  Go on find a Dust 2 24/7 32 players public server and enjoy the game
8423	1	a	A real classic game. I lost track about how many time I've spent playing CS
8425	1	a	you should play this because i made a lot of maps for it. if you would like a copy i will buy it for you.
8427	1	a	9/10 Great Game, Worth having in your steam account!
8429	1	a	good game but complicated story
8431	1	a	Everyone should have played Counter-Strike 1.6.  This game defined online MP shooters, and is still played to this day.
8433	1	a	Best fps of all time, was in 1999 and still is in 2011
8435	1	a	The original recipe of counter strike. Play it or Die!
8437	1	a	Best! buy it ^^
8439	1	a	What can I say, nostalgia and a great childhood. This was one of my first games back on my old steam account when I was around 8. I hardly remember my first experiances but I remember staying up and playing this all night once(first all nighter :3). Of course not just because of nostalgia but excelent gameplay, excelent movement, and perfect balance. 10/10 
8441	1	a	Very good game ! Best ! :)
8443	1	a	The original Cunter Snipe! The only nonsource game actualy played by people!

8479	1	a	Awesome game! Excellent variety of weapons and maps. Great feel. Not like any other FPS i have ever played. 100/10!
8481	1	a	The legandary game
8483	1	a	The classic orginal that started one of the best FPS MP games of all time! This game is still really good, and a classic now, but there are not as many servers as there used to be. It is great to go back and visit though.
8485	1	a	This is a best game ! ever !
8487	1	a	Best gave what i ever player xx
8489	1	a	Counter Strike is the best FPS Multiplayer Action(Shooting) game i have played till now...
8491	1	a	Gameplay: 10/10 LAN Fun: 3/3  Good Servers: 2/7  Counter-Strike, perhaps the most competitive game of it's time, hasn't aged well graphics-wise, but the gameplay remains more precise and consistent than most FPS games today. This game is a  great  LAN game for get-togethers, but otherwise you may have come too late on perhaps one of the greatest games of all time. Servers that I have connected to show that I have horrible ping, and the lag assures me of that. I have come across a server or two that I can connect to and enjoy, as well as being vanilla-CS, considering all the servers that mainly run modded games (which is about 4/5 of the servers). So here are the reasons to buy the original Counter-Strike:   Pros  -Can run on a potato -Plays smoothly no matter the settings. (However, you can connect to a server somewhere in Latin America or the Middle East, and lag like heck.) -Great fun to play with friends, as it can get really competitive, but at the same time your friends may not have this ancient gem, so this is dependent on the situation. -Solid gameplay. Nothing else really compares to the precision that went into it over the years. -Large map selection, as well as custom-maps found all over the internet. -Mods, but many are not as good as some of the others. You have to dig through garbage to find the fun ones.   Cons  -Very few good servers -Hard to convince people that don't already know how great this game is to buy it, considering it's more than a decade old. -So...many...sound...file...downloads...from...servers... -Custom maps are very rarely as balanced as maps packed in with the game.   Verdict  If you've got the money, and are curious as to what this legendary game is like, then it wouldn't be a complete waste, but if you are coming here from the latest CS or CoD or Battlefield, without having played other older FPS games, then you might regret the buy because this is a game that is quite outdated in terms of UI and such, and might not be appealing.  Overall 7/10 now, after more than a decade since release.
8493	1	a	i have problem with cs 1.6   when i open cs 1.6 show to me black screen  'black screen' :( 
8495	1	a	horrible gfx
8497	1	a	Old but still gold! Amazing how people keep playing this! Still a fun game c: Happy to be able to play it again ^^
8499	1	a	I recommend playing it !
8501	1	a	its the best FPS there is, Just a tip if you a kid. If you buy this game, its really hard....
8503	1	a	Hellio guys plz help me when i am run Counter Strike it works fine i see ct then the black screen show's up and Half life ahs stopped working :/ plz help me
8505	1	a	Top Game, it's one of those games you must own.
8507	1	a	my mouse is stuck while playing counter strike i can use the arrows button only to turn left or right its only with this game , there is no problems with counter strike source or other games .. please help   thanks .
8509	1	a	Counter Strike is a classic game. Fun, addictive, and customizable. It's incredibly easy to mod, texture and map for so you could expect a whole lotta mods.  Pros: -Great gameplay, bit of a learning curve but it'll become second instinct soon enough -Servers are still up, even for such an old game it still has a whole crap-ton of servers.  -Modding community is GREAT -Cheap, as in really freakin cheap, not indie game cheap, but still very cheap Cons -Most people who you will play with have been playing for longer than I have been alive. Expect to get pwned very very often -Netcode is a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, adjusting settings using the console takes a hell of a while -People are sometimes way too serious when playing -For Graphics junkies: Graphics are pretty damn old-looking (what the hell do you expect it's GoldSrc)  While it's not a perfect game it still provided me with tons of fun and I love playing it. It's a bit slower than CSGO and the weapons behave differently.   Conclusion: If you want a nice classic shooter that's light on the pocket and the computer then this along with Half-Life should be in your library
8511	1	a	The best FPS created. It is because of this game that the FPS was revolutionized, be it in the competitive scene and the casual scene. Nothing can compare to the greatness of this game.
8513	1	a	Nice Gamer
8515	1	a	a:D
8517	1	a	cool game
8519	1	a	It's just Counter-Strike, i don't know what to say...

8525	1	a	 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HJ0AiLQqM   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7eLDF_yDpk 
8527	1	a	CS 1.6  It will search for you. It will find you. And someone in the game will probably kill you. If you are noob that is.  10/10 Would kill noobs again.
8529	1	a	Counter-Strike is an almost perfectly balanced mix of teamwork and individual skill with enough depth and nuance to inspire countless esports competitions.
8531	1	a	nice game ever
8533	1	a	just the best of the all games in the world 
8535	1	a	This is a classic game. It still to this day has a huge player base. Yet the ones that still play are true die hard CS fans. Most are very skilled and have been playing the game sense day one. Still one of the best CS I have ever played. Before anyone asks I run this game on windows 8 and it works like a charm. I HIGHLY recommend this game to anyone looking for a classic FPS experience.
8537	1	a	Like a baws !
8539	1	a	Rumored to be a CS:GO clone.
8541	1	a	The Original and possibily still the best (minus the riot shields). If you love nostalgia as much as I do, and you don't own this game but used to play it at LAN cafes maybe? Get it already!
8543	1	a	Old school Counter-Strike, it's just the best.

8669	1	a	: )
8671	1	a	i will never stop playing this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game...i loVe it!!!!!! ^_*
8673	1	a	Great game.
8675	1	a	I recommend to other players its very cool.
8677	1	a	I've played this game for years never forget
8679	1	a	The best fps ever made!
8681	1	a	Counter-Strike 1.6: the very first game I played using steam... I used to play it alot... Now there are Counter-Strike games with better graffix. But the original is still damn good!
8683	1	a	In my opinion: CS is the best game ever made! CS 1.3 was my personal favorite update, but 1.6 is and always will be amazing. I still pub a de_dust2 server daily.
8685	1	a	Old, but good!
8687	1	a	1337
8689	1	a	WonerFul and interresting game
8691	1	a	if you never played counter strike before  get ready to be scrubed on       you nub
8693	1	a	The legacy speaks for itself. One of the greatest mod-â™¥â™¥â™¥-games ever.
8695	1	a	Like Half Life 1, Counterstrike is an undeniable classic.
8697	1	a	Even though i was VAC Banned (seriously don't remember hacking or anything).  This game is still better that CS GO and CSS in my opinion. I don't know how to explain it, i honestly think it's just nostalgia. But i don't think i will ever hate this game...  As the other games. Counter Strike has ALOT of gamemodes (Zombie , Deathrun , Hide 'n' Seek , etc.)  I would suggest you buy this game if you like CS GO or CSS
8699	1	a	most addictive game ever made!
8701	1	a	It's wasting to much of your free time.
8703	1	a	Worlds greatest first person shooter game!
8705	1	a	Classic game I still like it. It should be cheaper.
8707	1	a	play on
8709	1	a	Classic game. 8/10
8711	1	a	This was my childhood in a nutshell
8713	1	a	very nice and good game
8715	1	a	The Best and the Legend among MP games :) &lt;3
8717	1	a	From a multiplayer and competitive point of view, its the best or second best game (to Q2) in existence Graphics are somewhat dated
8719	1	a	Classic of classics.
8721	1	a	Old but Gold!!
8723	1	a	CLASSIC AND A MUST HAVE GAME!!! I highly recommend this game to everyone who enjoys killing games! It a rather simple game with simple onjectives either to deactivate the bomb, kill the other players, or rescue hostages. In my opinion its worth every dollar! :D
8725	1	a	This game is epic!
8727	1	a	This not Game This is My Life )))
8729	1	a	I've started the game with the version 1.5:)

8763	1	a	Great game to spind late nights with. The time just flies into space and you wake up in another time the future. excelent game then and certainly is now.
8765	1	a	This is the game that ruined my childhood ! I literally was playing it all day long ( previously was playing on non steam) It was one of the best games back then, but now CS:GO has taken its lead, so i recommend you buying Global Offensive.
8767	1	a	really good game
8769	1	a	This is a classic, would recommend. Its okay 10/10
8771	1	a	Hands down the most addictive team-play based game out there.

8799	1	a	I grow up on CS 1.6, but now it is unplayable. a lot of garbage on servers a lot of music and useless things. low download speed, and everybody hack everywhere. Please make something with this game, just need some patch, for disable downloadable contetn, and useless things...
8801	1	a	CEL MAI TARE JOC!!!
8803	1	a	This is game was good ten years ago...and still is
8805	1	a	i think this games a piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, cuz my game froze up and crashed, so i restarted my comp, and loaded cs go, come to find out i am banned from competitive play for a week....... ty steam for having such â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥in great laggy servers..... â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ers...

8821	1	a	Old,but awesome game.I play HNS.Hide 'n Seek.I recommend it you can try to buy it.
8823	1	a	This is still the ultimate FPS in terms of skill and balance. I have yet to find another game that has come close to the level of skill required to become a professional.
8825	1	a	this game is awsome !
8827	1	a	I have been playing this game since I was very young. Now, I'm still playing it. I still remember the times when I was playing with my friends on our own server; such great days back then. 11/10 without any doubt.
8829	1	a	Counter Strike is one of the best first person shooter in the whole world, its so funny to play hns and other gamemodes! Yes i recommend this awesome game! 10/10 little cats!

8867	1	a	This game will always be my favorite counter-strike and it's a game from my younger years that I enjoyed. Not alot of people play it anymore but it's still good. I'd just get a bunch of friends to buy it and have a 5v5 lan. c: :3 &lt;3
8869	1	a	This game is a legend. Such a game will not be ever. It will never die, will live on forever! 
8871	1	a	Best in the Counter Strike series, have been playing this mostly since 2004. Sadly, there are only fewer players and servers now...
8873	1	a	#1
8875	1	a	Very old game, but is still one of the best fps games ever. This is accepted as the best Counter Strike ever and I can agree. The mechanics feel great and the weapons are all very fun to use. rating 10/10  Chris
8877	1	a	Best Game I eveR playeD..
8879	1	a	Go go go , play the game.

8887	1	a	Well, the graphics hurt the eyes, but the gameplay is still pretty decent.

8891	1	a	:)
8893	1	a	Game that 'll never RIP
8895	1	a	best game online..play it
8897	1	a	for some reason running Counter Strike Source and exiting makes the computer think it's playing CS but other than that good game although I probably only played for 533 seconds rather than 533 hours
8899	1	a	One of the most revolutionary FPS Online games ever. It's an superb FPS Team Tactical shooter game that has few different game modes with lots of great maps! Highly recommend it to other's out there that is looking for great competive challenging online gaming.
8901	1	a	Counterstrike 1.6...recommendation...  ...  'Since 1999 - There's no need for it'  - asH  10 / 10 Punkte
8903	1	a	This game is still popular ! I recommend it to everyone!
8905	1	a	best online action GAME!! 
8907	1	a	A really nice game :D
8909	1	a	Just 1 Word : AWESOME ! 
8911	1	a	The game that started the Counter Strike franchise and probably one of the best. Counter Strike didn't have the graphics but it had the gameplay we all know to love in a CS game.
8913	1	a	wish u comeback!!! =/
8915	1	a	this will always be one of my favorite shooters, great fun game.

8951	1	a	The best online first person shooter ever made.  EDIT: It's sad when a game released in 1999 is better than a game that came out in 2012.
8953	1	a	Love this cs,I Remeber for ever
8955	1	a	GREAT â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ GABEN! I r8 8/8 m8 its rly gr8
8957	1	a	Since ~ 2003
8959	1	a	Its as outdated as the Nintendo Entertainment System but it will always have a special place in my spleen.
8961	1	a	The king of all FPS games.
8963	1	a	The Best Game
8965	1	a	i love this game
8967	1	a	one of my most favorite games of all time.
8969	1	a	Classic! nuff said!
8971	1	a	This is my favourite game and also from my point of view the moust interesting shooter game ever made. Is best to play it with friends or with other people to test your skills.
8973	1	a	Classic, I like it just as much as CS:GO and the community is great. No competitive option for normal players, but still fun when playing with friends.
8975	1	a	its really nice game i know its old but its really still batter than call of duty
8977	1	a	this game is so old that every fps player owns it xD  
8979	1	a	old school game ....it was a pleasure to play it thanks valve
8981	1	a	Best game ever, all the mods make the game worth buying and playing even in 2015!
8983	1	a	The world will NEVER forget this game! I am really proud of it!
8985	1	a	Cool game ^^
8987	1	a	I know what you're thinking. 'Did he fire all 7 shots or only 6?' Well, to tell you the truth, in all this excitement, I've kinda lost track myself. But being this a .50 Desert Eagle, the most powerful handgun in the game, and it is a one-shot kill with a headshot, you've got to ask yourself one question. 'Do I feel lucky?' Well, do you, punk?
8989	1	a	This is by far one of the most fun online shooters ever. If not the best ever made, And in my opinion the game that pretty much started the genre. Ive been playing the game off and on since it's release and still to this day it never gets old. The game runs really good on modern pc's and it's really a game that when your doing good you really feel a sense of accomplishment. Plenty of fun maps to play on, plenty of servers to play on, plenty of customization options. This is one game that you can really taylor to suit your style. Plenty of user created skins for your weapons that can really make this game look amazing. And I still prefer counter strike over counter strike source. I don't know, call it nostalgia or whatever but there really is something about just good ol' counter strike 1.6 that is just simply magical. It truley is a classic in every sense of the word. And STILL is just as enjoyable (if not more enjoyable) then any online shooter on the market today. So glad I got to grow up with this game. I would definitley recommend it to any fan of competitive online first person shooters. Come Join the fun.
8991	1	a	Very good game! I like it! Lets play. ;)

9061	1	a	Very Good Game :)
9063	1	a	Well I can Remember standing in line for this game on day 1. it was on a cd and this is well before steam was invented.  you had to install the retail patches yourself back then it was a pain. thank goodness they brought out steam hey. anyway this was my first online game I ever played and I've not stopped since. I still play counter strike to this day 15 years later but im on csgo nowadays. this game lost me my girlfriend so thanks valve haha   overall amazing game 10/10
9065	1	a	My very first game on Steam, great game however I do not recommend it anymore as most servers has viruses which redirects you to a russian server and NOBODY WANTS THAT!! &gt;:(  But it's a great game and will always be one. â™¥
9067	1	a	Best game of its time, and recent times.
9069	1	a	Best game of 90z,
9071	1	a	got this game free in a giveaway.  Hours of fun ahead! 
9073	1	a	im a counter strike fanatic and always will be, this i think is the best in the series it is what created and started the demolition modes in most fps games and fps multiplayer games, there is even a freakin nexon korean mmofps of this (i play that alot), this game and game series rules if you do not own it what is wrong with you ?! its part of PC FPS history!!!
9075	1	a	
9077	1	a	FIrst game in inventory!
9079	1	a	cool
9081	1	a	The best FPS game there existed on earthrealm!!
9083	1	a	this is the best FPS first person shooter around, it might be an old one but still has extreme amount of players and servers online, it is this most real life shooter i have evry played and i recommend it for any FPS or first person shooters out there. HAPPY GAMING EVERYONE
9085	1	a	Nice game
9087	1	a	the best!!
9089	1	a	.
9091	1	a	nice game relative good graphics
9093	1	a	Boom Headshot, the best game ever
9095	1	a	This game is very fun! its just G[old]
9097	1	a	March, 1998... Two iconic games released.. FOR SOME REASON THIS ONE IS STILL FUN... O.O
9099	1	a	BEST GAME EVER MADE !
9101	1	a	The Start Of it All...
9103	1	a	Better graphics than Witcher 3
9105	1	a	:)
9107	1	a	Still the best counter strike game !
9109	1	a	Having only played CSGO for the past year or so, it is really nice to see what that game was rooted off of. I now know playing 1.6 what all the hype about Counter Strike is and the history behind it. 1.6 for it's time period was such a benchmark game. Really awesome!
9111	1	a	Classic!
9113	1	a	One word for CS Its 'Awsome'
9115	1	a	Old school lovely game
9117	1	a	This game is very old,but it is still one of the most enjoyable and played games.I read in a comment that,for gamers,the graphics aren't important,but the gameplay is.When we talk about Counter-Strike 1.6,it is very true.
9119	1	a	Classic..
9121	1	a	Polecam fr2ps.
9123	1	a	Oldschool is still cool &lt;3
9125	1	a	If you think that de_dust2 is boring you can play its lego version on pokemon diablo2 warcraft mod bunnyhopping shooting green beams and lightning bolts at zombie chickens. Easy modding.
9127	1	a	15 â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing years son.
9129	1	a	...
9131	1	a	I love this game!!! Buy it!
9133	1	a	Best game of the first decade of the 21st century, and, along with its sequal, global offensive, best team based tactical shooter there is. 10/10.
9135	1	a	one of the most amazing action games of this generation... we hope that the game is played even by the next generation :D
9137	1	a	I liked this game once. It looks like minecraft o.o
9139	1	a	CS deep on our hearts since 1999! â™¥ Is not outdated at all, is the same ex-girlfriend that wants to suck the life out of your being.  I also recommend CS GO over Source:  http://store.steampowered.com/app/730/  Spread the love! ;)
9141	1	a	Hands down best FPS game ever. #nesc #1447 #ureshii
9143	1	a	what else i can say .............. its the best fps game i ever play specially with friends and groups it have the connection type with players
9145	1	a	I love this game
9147	1	a	Really? Do I really need to comment this?
9149	1	a	Still the best CS ever made!
9151	1	a	the only game I play lol
9153	1	a	Who likes getting rekt at video games?  This is the game for you :D
9155	1	a	After all these years this shooter remains to be a classic that can't be ignored. No other shooter is as accessible, easy to play, simple nor skillful as this. It can be enjoyed anywhere with the 64MB portable version for LAN parties. It's all about aim, accuracy, quick reflexes but does have a strategical element since it is a tactical shooter and there's no respawning. This game was a major turning point in the history of FPS, and this game is what made online multiplayer competitive gaming so popular.
9157	1	a	Want to enjoy a FPS but don't want to spend 14.99 on CS:GO or Call of Duty? This is a great game for the price, Pretty much the same as CS:GO but not as good graphics. Lots of people still play this so it is still fun. 10/10
9159	1	a	It's good.
9161	1	a	Legend game&gt;love this
9163	1	a	Never before has a multiplayer game blended all the elements of true competition and sweat-soaked-shirt anxiety as well a Counter-Strike (CS). You probably already know CS as one of the most popular modifications for Half-Life. It's been available for download for over a year, at least in beta form. But unless you've got a super fast Internet connection at your house, you may not have played it yet as the nearly 100 megabyte download may be daunting for those of you not fortunate enough to have a high-speed connection. Thankfully CS has turned into a full-blown retail game and, while the two versions of CS are identical, it certainly worth shelling out $30 for this stellar title...plus you get a few more multiplayer goodies in the retail package to boot.   Let me start off by saying that the Counter-Strike pack is a stand-alone product. You don't need the original Half-Life to play this game. In the retail package you get a full version of CS as well as Team Fortress Classic, Opposing Force multiplayer, and the Wanted, Redemption and Firearms mods. The entire pack is overflowing with multiplayer fun, but, of course, the real focus of the retail release is Counter-Strike.   There is a single-player component to CS and, while it provides a good primer, this mod is all about online action. You basically play a game of cat and mouse, with the mouse being a terrorist group and the cat a squad of counter-terrorists. As a terrorist, you're goal is to plant a bomb at a specific location or hold a group of hostages. As a counter-terrorist, it's your duty to defuse said bomb or rescue the ill-fated hostages. Taking out all players on the opposing side will also assure your victory.   CS is an action lover's dream, with games lasting only four or five minutes (if that in some cases) because, unlike Half-Life, one shot to the head can mean instant death. CS is the perfect mix between fast-action and realistic damage. You can't just absorb bullet after bullet and expect to walk away. Working as a team is a must and, while you're in the game, taking the lone wolf approach will often get you killed...and fast.   It's the team-based tactics that make CS so fun. I can't stress how important it is in this game to act as a team. If your team is on the defensive side you'll all benefit by creating a cohesive strategy. If you team is on the offensive side, you will all benefit by sticking closely together as well. I'm sure you've seen movies or television show demonstrating this 'Conga Line' style of infiltration. Well, that's exactly how your team will have to act. This creates a fantastic game balance that will keep you coming back for more. It'll also keep you from thinking about your school work, your job, and interaction with your loved ones, and often work around the IGN offices will be put on hold so we can clog our network with CS.   Visually the game will not disappoint. While the Half-Life engine isn't the prettiest beast out there, there is plenty of animation that creates a smooth look and feel, and the gun models are some of the most realistic looking of any shooter available. The environmental textures look realistic enough and complement the provided camouflage well enough for you to be hidden, but not be invisible. As in real life, the distinguishable difference between good guy and bad guy is a little difficult, but the balance to this is if you can't tell who it is then you probably won't be able to hit him with your gun. Now, if you've purchased sniper rifle, you should have plenty of scope magnification to tell the difference between terrorist or counter-terrorist, but otherwise you may be taking out a team member from afar.   As good as it is, a couple of features of this game really stood out as frustrating... at first. But over a period of time they actually became enhancements to online multiplayer gaming. One feature is buying your weapons at the start of each round. This takes a little getting used to at first since, in most shooters, you just run around picking up weapons at your heart's content. Usually by the time you figured out which guns, grenades, and armor you were going to take in your early games, the bad guys would come over and kill you. But a couple of tries later, after getting the gist of things, you're off in no time. The other feature that took some getting used to was the 'wait and watch' feature after you get killed. Once you sustain a lethal injury, you have to wait for the next round to start before you can join in again -- you don't just spawn again and start shooting. This actually adds a ton of anxiety to your efforts of staying alive and completing your objective. But like I mentioned before, the rounds are short, so you shouldn't have to wait too long before you can jump in the action again.   Not surprisingly, the user interface is very Half-Life-esque. Gamers who have played Half-Life or any of the other mods for the game will have no trouble with the menu system. Even for the first time user the interface is easy to use or fumble through. The only thing that even slightly tripped us up in the interface is the 'Update' on the server page. First-time users may be confused into thinking this meant update my version of CS. Not true, it actually means update the list of game servers. But the rest of the interface is easy to understand and even easier to navigate.  Just about the only aspect of this game that we could make negative comments about is the sound. Sure, the realistic guns sounds are spot on, we just wish the same amount of attention to detail was given to the rest of the sound in the game. Some levels have lighting and thunder. When the thunder crashes it sounds a little wimpy. We were hoping for some deeper bass and clearer sounding claps from the lightning. In most of the level the user can go inside or out side of buildings, the sound of their footsteps should also change to reflect what type of surface they are walking on. The sound of footsteps getting closer and closer could also have been improved. As it stands now, it's hard to tell how far down the hallway or street a bad guy is from you by sound alone.  So how long does the magic last? Well we've been playing this game for over a year now and we still can't get enough of it. Are we tired of it? Hell no! We're still surprised by how fun this game is. This game actually made some of us squeal like little school-girls after getting sniped from an unexpected angle on high. On the other hand some of us were drawn to stand up and scream obscenities at the monitor. I guess we'll just have to get them next time!   In a nutshell, if you're looking for the next step in online first person shooters, then look no further. CS is fast paced, intense, and satisfying--this game will not disappoint. This is truly one of the best mods for one of the all time greatest first person shooters ever, and the retail package of CS is simply bursting with multiplayer goodness. If you like to play shooters online, get this pack!
9165	1	a	Great game I've spent way much hours than these 2k on my acc. It brings your memories back!
9167	1	a	Oldschool is always the best!

9287	1	a	still one of the best games i've played on the computer
9289	1	a	Hands Down. It's Counter-Strike the GOD DAMN SEXY Half-Life Mod. No Other-Mods that makes HL into an AWESOME Multiplayer FPS Game. Introducing Bomb and Defuse , Hostage , etc.   Pros :  - Gameplay is Fun!  - A Hell lot of Server  - Large Community ( did i said large. i mean â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing huge )  Cons :  - The Steam Version doesn't have Bots ( except cs:cz ) 
9291	1	a	...
9293	1	a	This is not a game but a religion, a way of life. If you are not upto the competetion better stay away from it.
9295	1	a	awesome game,i use to play cz before but now i realized cs 1.6 is by far the best game i ever played
9297	1	a	never gets bored of this game :)
9299	1	a	Best game, i playing CS for 8 years, and i never stop playing the game. memories
9301	1	a	This Is the best game in teh world. BUY IT NOW
9303	1	a	The best FPS I have ever played. From the original beta versions in 1999 up untill version 1.6 I all love. Some more than others but the basic gameplay is just awesome.  It is highly addictive and frustration levels can rise to highest possible but the fun of teaming up and achieving the kills / goals is just a rush ;) Okay, the graphics are not the greatest anymore, but the fact that after all these years I still pick up the game and play it says enough for me.   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FiGwvCZ1X0&amp;feature=related   Check it out! :P
9305	1	a	CS
9307	1	a	the best fps game ever...everything about this game is awesome. real addictive.....love this one
9309	1	a	Counter-Strike is one of the most nostalgiac experiences i've had. With that being said I enjoyed the steam version for my 24 hours playing it. However there is a great bit of lag on most servers in this game although I shouldn't have any. Putting that aside however Counter-Strike is still one of the most revolutionary games for its time. The multiplayer may be dying down and I have yet to convert to go which I dont know if I will. If you got this with Half Life you remember getting this with it. This is still the same fun game from that period that has come to be a cult classic. It plays very well and is fun to play with friends. Although I may find Team Fortress 2 more enjoyable from my short time playing that game, I shall still enjoy Counter-Strike for what it was.
9311	1	a	I just &lt;3 this game !
9313	1	a	Best for the Best!!
9315	1	a	
9317	1	a	1.6 4 life.
9319	1	a	Nice game!
9321	1	a	thumbs up !!
9323	1	a	!
9325	1	a	Fun and stuff
9327	1	a	^^
9329	1	a	10/10
9331	1	a	It is one of the best FPS game available online. Even today its craze has not ended. From a NaVi player i heard that steam version provides very low lag due to which i purchased the game and for sure i was 100% satisfied. You would not believe my ping dropped to 19~21 from 200~1500.
9333	1	a	Nice game :D
9335	1	a	great game 100/10
9337	1	a	The stripped-down FPS that delivers raw competition and insane replayability.  My childhood wouldn't be the same without this game. Too bad i'm old now. I should have kept up.
9339	1	a	What a GAME!!
9341	1	a	Its a to class game.
9343	1	a	Really reccomended game!
9345	1	a	1337
9347	1	a	I love this game!
9349	1	a	Still the most epic game ever created. Yes CS:GO is great, and is a definite CS reviver, BUT, 1.6 will forever be the game that ruined our lives!  Commited thousands of hours to 1.6, 1.5 and all previous iterations. Started way way back when it was still a mod for HL1. Growing up and watching the game grow and turn into what it has become has been a truly great experience.  This game is still alive, and you can still have hundreds of hours of fun on it, so give it a go :)
9351	1	a	Its aight, not the best tbh.
9353	1	a	cool
9355	1	a	Better than csgo, 10/10 would buy again
9357	1	a	tis is real classic
9359	1	a	i love this game this game is awesome!
9361	1	a	Counter-Strike set the foundation for online competitive team-play FPS. And it's still a viable game over 10 years later.
9363	1	a	Recommend!
9365	1	a	remembers me good times :)
9367	1	a	This game is 10/10
9369	1	a	Still the GOAT!
9371	1	a	Great game.
9373	1	a	great game
9375	1	a	you cant see the sun again if u install &amp; play it
9377	1	a	Best game ever still to this day.
9379	1	a	Amazing shooter!!! it would definitely be in my top 10 shooter games of all time
9381	1	a	this game is awesome
9383	1	a	Still the best competitive FPS
9385	1	a	A great competitive game, with mostly a great community! I love this game and I really managed to make some new friends :).
9387	1	a	This game are best VERY BEST's !!!! 2001. Oh yeah, 1992 1.5 &lt;3  Like GAME &lt;3 !!!
9389	1	a	+1
9391	1	a	This game is byfar one of the best fps game I have ever played! I remember when I used to play this on the original xbox and had so much fun playing it. I was really sad when my controller broke and I couldn't play it anymore but soon after that I got the xbox 360 and started to play COD and GTA. Then, I started playing on PC and all I played was Minecraft until I downloaded steam and I found Counter Strike. I had no idea it would come with CS:CZ so I decided to play it and it was more fun than CS. I enjoy to play this game and I'm sure that I will continue to love this game!
9393	1	a	.
9395	1	a	Play the original that started it all. complete with no skin no crates no keys and a whole lot of nostalgia!
9397	1	a	Still nice after all these years. Just need to get all those annoying cheating kids off your back
9399	1	a	nice, what'eva!
9401	1	a	classic game that will not die
9403	1	a	the good old days

9411	1	a	This is the game that got me into CS and furthered my career in this game lovd it from the start and enjoying every minute of it! If your on CSS come and join me on the Australian DTK ( Dying To Kill) Servers, i am an admin on De_dust 2 deathmatch! looking forward to kicking some â™¥â™¥â™¥ with you! mwhahah
9413	1	a	Best of classic!
9415	1	a	Old game, but its class
9417	1	a	Well... isn't it a classic? CS should not require a review. You should get it, whether it's 1.6, CS:S or CS:GO.
9419	1	a	Good enough for FUN. BEsides that try Global Offensive.
9421	1	a	Still one of the better FPS-games!
9423	1	a	Play to Counter Strike 5x5
9425	1	a	[-_-]
9427	1	a	cool
9429	1	a	Get a gun and do headshots. Sounds easy dosint it?
9431	1	a	When I was 17 years old, I escaped 34 days from school to play this with my friends and I didn't pass in school that year .  Now it's 11 years later and I still consider that year the best in my life .  11/10 would escape from school again .    
9433	1	a	Even if this game is old, it's pretty amazing and fun. Some mods kinda suck, but classic remains the best.
9435	1	a	Yes I very recomand this game !!!!!!
9437	1	a	10/10
9439	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥'s mad whack awesome
9441	1	a	People only still play this because they have bad computers are just jealous and claim 1.6 is better than source. But on the topic, this game is what started it all. If it was never created, there wouldn't be Counter-Strike:Source.
9443	1	a	This is the best game of all the CS games. The only downside is that it is an outdated game, and it's not really worth getting into it now. If you're barely getting into Counter-Strike, then just go for Global Offensive, it's the better choice for the new players.
9445	1	a	Old but gold
9447	1	a	Old school game. This game change the wolrd.
9449	1	a	*-*
9451	1	a	it's like sex for the first time
9453	1	a	Counter Strike is an first person shooter that was released in the late 90's.  Whats it about?  Well Counter strike is an online first person shooter where you either play as an terrorist or an counter terrorist.  The terrorists objective is to transport a bomb to a bombsite located on each map marked as (A) or (B). Whilst the counter terrorists main objective is to stop the terrorist force from planting the bomb.  Theres also a gamemode where the terrorists will have hostages and the counter terrorists objective is to rescue the hostages before the time runs out.  Game ends when the counter terrorists has saved all hostages or the terrorists has whiped all counter terrorists.   Is it worth buying?  Since this is an really old game and the graphics are really outdated compared to the games we have today i would still say this game is worth buying.  The game is over 15 years old but still has a alot of active players and playing with friends make it even better.  Counter Strike also has alot of maps, mods and other stuff that makes the game better in any way.  Graphics. 7/10 Sound. 8/10 Gameplay. 10/10  This review is based on my own opinion and noone elses!
9455	1	a	cool
9457	1	a	Very cool game, me liked ;)
9459	1	a	game of all time.Old woman cs 1.6
9461	1	a	Counter-strike is like a fine wine. It gets better with age. That is to say, the more time goes on, the higher quality players remain, resulting in a great game today.
9463	1	a	Awesome game of all the times
9465	1	a	BestGameInHisotry #FPS
9467	1	a	:
9469	1	a	Great Game!
362	0	a	;)
9471	1	a	This game is just as good as it was 10 years ago. It's the Tetris of FPS. You will still find tons of people to play with (half of them annoying kids, just like 10 years ago) and find yourself neglecting your modern games...
9473	1	a	10/10
9475	1	a	I love this game!
9477	1	a	A old but gold game  From 1.6 it was the beggining,don't forget , a LEGEND game , and I still enjoy this when I play
9479	1	a	:)
9481	1	a	simply i kike this game too much !  i m not a good gamer but soon i would be a good gamer of cs 1.6 :)))
9483	1	a	Best online shooter in the world of all times
9485	1	a	yep it's the original countre strike, be a terrorist or a counter terrorist and shoot points to score, beautiful smooth gameplay, much better than that crappy source engine updates, come up with a good spraypaint logo to reach the bonnus round, i like the surf levels as well, valve when will you finally listen to the community and make surfing an actual game mode? it is a very respectful game for it's age and i give it a good score in the end.
9487	1	a	one of my all time favorite games... this is a classic. i will never forget the fast paced action this game encompasses due to my youth. i played countless hours of this and loved every second of it.
9489	1	a	^_^
9491	1	a	B17B4367...,.,.,.,...., 4 Terrorists / 3 Counter-Terrorists
9493	1	a	eh, classic
9495	1	a	This was the beggining of the Couter-Strike game.This was the most fun game i played for a few years , im glad that they keep making new games.The only thing i can say is keep up the good work!!
9497	1	a	Write a review for Counter-Strike Please describe what you liked or disliked about this game and whether you recommend it to others. Please remember to be polite and follow the Rules and Guidelines.
9499	1	a	U Had to start somewhere &lt;3

9525	1	a	One of the best games ever made.
9527	1	a	.............
9529	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing high game
9531	1	a	I've played it off and on for the past 8 years of my life. It is a true classic game. And it is still alive!! The multiplayer community is alive and thriving! You won't have to deal with annoying Russians (depending on if you actually pick a Russian server...) or 8 year old FPS kids. Pick this game up if you love classic, FPS action with an amazing community.
9533	1	a	.
9535	1	a	Best of best, classic 1.6. I hope itÂ´ll never lose players.
9537	1	a	i can't leave this Game forEver &lt;3
9539	1	a	Good Game i love thi 10/10
9541	1	a	Best FPS game ever made and works great on mini laptops! :D
9543	1	a	Love it. Can't stop playing!
9545	1	a	A real classic!
9547	1	a	Instead of writing a long, drawn out, TL;DR review, I'll just give a summary of what that review would be:   Best game ever.
9549	1	a	My childhood in essence
9551	1	a	game is great(as ypu know it) but valve isn't working on it at all now cares about counter-strike:global offensive, there is too many servers with players downloaded it from some other site for free R.I.P. CS (1999-2012)
9553	1	a	21
9555	1	a	Aswesome Game Loving It &lt;3
9557	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
9559	1	a	CS:GO is defiantly better, but this brings back better memorys.
9561	1	a	+10
9563	1	a	Best FPS of all time
9565	1	a	This Is Very Good Game.
9567	1	a	1.6 â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ 
9569	1	a	123
9571	1	a	blah blah good game blah, this isnt where i parked my car?
9573	1	a	one of a kind
9575	1	a	This game may seem 'stupid' to some people, becasue of the graphis. This game is exactly like CSGO and the only difference is the graphics. Otherwise, everything is the same thing (excluding camos).
9577	1	a	Well, this game is kinda old school, but still gold, like this, i'm playing it like from 2009, but i'm still likeing it.
9579	1	a	This game doesn't need a review.
9581	1	a	Good and fun game!
9583	1	a	Only game to play, end of story.
9585	1	a	Not very many players online, but still a fun game. I play this when I get bored of CS:GO.  My only gripe is that somehow malicious servers can override your controls. For example, a server overwrote my keybind configuation so that every time I pressed w, it would connect to their server.
9587	1	a	Nice game, mann awesome game mode :)
9589	1	a	the orignial that started it all nuff said
9591	1	a	Very old fps shooter still at the top charts! SmaLler file that steam
9593	1	a	Back in past :D
9595	1	a	This game is immortal! She will never forget.
9597	1	a	Now i can spray in a lower res
9599	1	a	the best game in the world
9601	1	a	A really good competitive fps, CS:GO is more recent so it has a bigger playerbase if you are looking for the game everyone plays.  PS:Beware of the russians PPS:Cyk4 â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
9603	1	a	This game is very addictive and fun if you are looking for a realy good old game this one is for you
9605	1	a	The reason why counter-strike got that big in my eyes.  1.6 still have a space in my heart.   10/10!
9607	1	a	After all this time? Always..
9609	1	a	*kggghh* Fire in the hole!! *kggghh*
9611	1	a	its a great game but flaws pros: graphics,gameplay,guns,servers,(people still play) cons:lag,most servers are in other countries (i live in the us), but if you are a fan of fps go back to the classics 8/10 
9613	1	a	COOL GAME AND NICE GRAPICS 
9615	1	a	CS 1.6. n0thing but headshots.
9617	1	a	Rate : 10/10 Actually i am a lover of CS. I mean ALL cs editions.
9619	1	a	This is a classic game and has been great for years!
9621	1	a	It's a pretty good game.
9623	1	a	This game is a wonderful coop and multiplayer game  Yhe best game that was played of most players in 2000 - 2007
9625	1	a	You shoot people and they shoot back
9627	1	a	I still pop in to play every now and then and I feel like a young kid again.
9629	1	a	One of my all time favourite games! You never get bored playing this. You may not find its graphics to be very cool as per today's standard; but, old is gold!
9631	1	a	Very good game, lots of fun! 9/10
9633	1	a	Old but gold
9635	1	a	The Game Number One on Line!!! excelent game despite having many years continue being  the best game of accion and estrategy.
9637	1	a	Yes best game!
9639	1	a	The best CS Game Ever !  I feel This game was made for me xD
9641	1	a	BEST classic game!
9643	1	a	Fire in the hole!
9645	1	a	^^
9647	1	a	The beggining of the competitive FPS scene in gaming.
9649	1	a	old shool game... brings back memories
9651	1	a	
9653	1	a	easy game
9655	1	a	Way better than global offensive, no over priced skins, no kids teamkilling you for no reason, no ranked\esport (so less Toxicity than GO). too bad it's abandonated,like source.
9657	1	a	13 yrs this game dominated online games
9659	1	a	Sometimes when people see other people's discussions about thing that they dont spend much time on, they believe this opinion wont be good 9 times out of 10. As for me, i've been playing this game for 10 years and only in 2015 i got it in steam. If i could count the hours i had played, i would have been about 8-9k hours. So, i think every person that likes shooters started to play this game in the beginning. Recommend it for everyone
9661	1	a	Nice and best fps game ever have played 6 years and still love to play it :)
9663	1	a	6/10
9665	1	a	It's fun LOL.

9669	1	a	Let me just say one thing: Who likes to play Counter-Strike 1.6 just play! As the saying goes, Spomenite childhood !! The game is excellent, but other versions of Counter-Strike is also awesome:) The very rare I go because I play Counter-Strike: Source, and other games .I advise everyone to play. If you have not played in Counter-Strike 1.6 - That you have not had a childhood = ((
9671	1	a	Go CSGO, I own cs 1.6, go is better the css, and 1.6, cs 1.6 can help alot understanding the 2 other main valve games, css, csgo.
9673	1	a	This game still bawls
9675	1	a	The time spent on this game &lt;33
9677	1	a	if there was a game that would let you shoot â™¥â™¥â™¥ out of you disfunkcional p3nis anyway 3/3 would suck

9695	1	a	cool this game :D and in VIP AND ADMIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
9697	1	a	.
9699	1	a	The fundamentals of Counter Strike can be viewed here through her origins. It is recommended for nostalgia, not immersive gameplay or graphics. A toaster can run counter strike.
9701	1	a	Historical. Mystical. Magical. Amazing. Old school sh*t !! (y)   WrAp3r,
9703	1	a	Was a fun game, until 1.3 came around. It was fun until people stared to camp the bomb sites, before that it was braveheart with guns. When that stopped so did the fun.
9705	1	a	#1 online action gaem,
9707	1	a	.
9709	1	a	Best game I have ever played. Will be hard to compete. RIP
9711	1	a	Why are you reading reviews?
9713	1	a	10/10 would throw grenade again

9717	1	a	You could work a bit at sound, to hear steps higher than guns :D
9719	1	a	.

9775	1	a	Its the best game i ever played.
9777	1	a	One of the best games i have ever played.  Must play...
9779	1	a	Truely a classic, I'd play this game over Global Offensive any day.
9781	1	a	Best FPS of all time.
9783	1	a	greatest mutliplayer fps off all time
9785	1	a	Still a great game.
9787	1	a	Great
9789	1	a	only cs 1.6
9791	1	a	The original, fun to play from time to time. Still, go and paly CSGO
9793	1	a	Nice game. 
9795	1	a	Hi. I have played thousands of hours of CS 1.6. Since then we have had CS: Condition Zero, CS: Source and now CS: Global Offensive. Which one is the best one? So, i still find CS 1.6 to be the most addictive, but the technical limitations are maddening by today's standards. For example, the detection of whether a player has been hit on 1.6 is just not accurate and it's frustrating. Yet that may be one of the reasons why 1.6 is so addictive.
9797	1	a	remember of the past ^_^
9799	1	a	Best game of all time. To bad it's dead now.
9801	1	a	The game that started it all!!!

The hours I've spent on this game from 2002 to 2009 gave me some of my laughs and let me meet some good, bad, and memorable people. Some that I still see and talk to. First picked this up in 8th grade at Gamestop which came with the classics bundle like TF1 and stuff :) great times
9889	1	a	Best game ever. You should definitely buy this and feel the nostalgia!
9891	1	a	This game is a classic game, this game is a must have by many steam users!
9893	1	a	Maybe comeback
9895	1	a	Classic. Try Zombie mod
9897	1	a	Good old cs 1.6
9899	1	a	Fire in the hole in C.S. 1.6 it's like â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ in CS:GO !
9901	1	a	I Love The Game !!
9903	1	a	what started it all
9905	1	a	Great game, one of my favourite games ever. This game and Quake III Arena are masterpieces of the online FPS genre.
9907	1	a	After so many years still the best fps ever made 10/10
9909	1	a	There are 3 games in the Counter-Strike series. There is Counter-Strike Source. Then you have the middle aged brother out of the group, Counter-Strike Condition Zero. Sure these two updated and improved versions are some what good. But the oldest brother is the best. Counter-Strike 1.6. Thought it is the oldest out of all the three, it seems to me that it's the most played and respected game out of them all. I mean sure the other two may be fun. But there is no match up to what the real game. What I mean by this, Counter-Strike 1.6 is the orignal and by far best Counter-Strike ever made. So basically this game may be old but it is the most played and fun out of the three.   Reason being, Counter-Strike 1.6 has the most active and filled Steam Community. The legit and good players of the Counter-Strike series have stayed with the old school. Even though 1.6 may not have as good as graphics as Condition Zero or Counter-Strike Source. It is the most played and talked about around the gaming world. You dont see big gaming websites talking about Condition Zero events. There are no big major Condition Zero events. All of the good and legit players are basically all playing Counter-Strike 1.6. Sure there is some talk about Counter-Strike Source. But non the less, Counter-Strike 1.6 takes some skill to play and become well known as a top notch player. As in Counter-Strike Source there are many messed up things with aim and registration. So really even the slitest baddies can get somewhere with Counter-Strike Source. For as in Counter-Strike 1.6 there is a good amount of skillz needed to play the gama. Atleast to play good.   Soon I hear that a new Counter-Strike is coming into play. Sort of a combination of all three games. Condition-Zero, Counter-Strike Source put some play into it. But see they do not use anything from Counter-Strike 1.6. Theres another good reason why this game is going to be just like Condition-Zero and Counter-Strike Source. Sure people may play the game for a while when its comes out. But all in all Counter-Strike 1.6 is going to be the best Counter-Strike game in the series. Like stated earlier graphics dont matter to me. As well as they dont matter to real gamers. If you play a game cause of it's graphics, then im really sorry to tell you that you are not a real gamer. Its said but true. Games are never about the graphics. Its what the game is and if people enjoy playing it. Sure graphics are sometimes nice. But Counter-Strike 1.6 does not have the greatest graphics in the world and it is one of the most well known and played games in the whole gaming world.
9911	1	a	.
9913	1	a	The most awesome shooter game of all time .
9915	1	a	:)
9917	1	a	Counter Strike is my life.
9919	1	a	This is a wonderful game &lt;3
9921	1	a	Its like normal coumter strike, but with mexicans and not russians
9923	1	a	Such play. Very shooter.wow. Doge recommends
9925	1	a	Best graphics 101010101010/10
9927	1	a	
9929	1	a	Counter-Strike is the OG multiplayer FPS. Grab your guns, choose a map, and kill enemies.
9931	1	a	This game is not new player friendly becaus there are only competetive player left in this game or over all hard mods to understand. Counter strike Global offensive is much more new player friendly so I recomend you picking up that game insted if you are new to counter strike.  but for you guys that know how to play cs you can pick up this game though it is prity hard to find english speaking servers and servers with no mods.

9983	1	a	Remains an old classic. The mechanics of the movement in this game is simply art. The way that you can gain boost by using a simple technique called 'bhoppin' aka 'bunnyhopping' is just overwhelming amazing. The graphics brings you straight back to the childhood, sitting there jumping around with your Desert-Eagle and AK-47. As said, an old classic, a must have game.
