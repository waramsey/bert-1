3125	1	a	Think Mario Kart or Worms for lovers of platformers. You can easily dip in and out of this so you can either play a couple of quick rounds or spend longer trying to improve.  Personally I find it funny when I manage to show a rare moment of brilliance by clawing my way to the front of the pack only to destroy myself in a comedy of errors in quick succession. Your mileage may vary.   Sometimes you'll get stuck with a group that favours voting for the same couple of fan made levels which I personally find a bit tedious to play but there is a good variety of stages both official and fan made.  It's up to you whether you want to just play casually or build on your skils and work you way through the level rankings but either way there is fun to be had and it never feels like a real chore.

20	1	a	My Take: A frantic paced game where you attempt to reach perfection on each level and will not rest until you have five stars. Rude gesture to all the protesters out there.   Graphics: Simple polygons, but everything is distinctive enough that you can make out what's what during high speeds.  Sound: Enough entertaining noises to distract you from how annoyed you are.  Music: Not good enough to listen to on its own, but well suits the pace of the game.  Controls: Standard look and movement bindings, but I should figure out better bindings for the other actions. I end up accidentally pressing a wrong key at inopportune times.  Did I Finish It: Not 100%, but I got to the end.  Will I Play it Again: Depends on how much content is in AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!!, which I have yet to play. It's is supposed to have the same levels remastered, so I'm going to say no.  Should You Buy It: If the above holds true, they're the same price so don't bother.

4447	0	a	This game could EASILY have become the best sim racing game on steam but is completely ruined by its terrible paywall system that they have. The visuals are very pleasing to the eye and the physics and sound add up to it to make the game feel like a very high end sim. Sadly the microtransaction hell that Sector 3 threw in really ruined the perfect opportunity to make the best simulator for racing fans to enjoy.   Its very depressing because RACE '07 and GTR 2 were both excellent and iconic simulation racing games. Maybe if they had followed the path of their previous games, RaceRoom wouldve been a simulator far better than Assetto Corsa, iRacing, or rFactor2 couldve ever been.  but no matter what i say, this is gonna get downvoted to hell because fanboys cant take having their beloved software being judged, and thats absolutely pathetic.    'Scores'
4584	1	a	The best sound and FFB of any racing game at the moment and everything else is on par with the others such as Assetto and pCars. Buy into it as much or as little as you want. Stand out for me is Zolder, Portimao, Laguna Seca and of course the Nordshleife.
5551	1	a	Respectable adaptation of the tabletop turn-based strategy game from the Warhammer universe. It has its own weird quirks, but once you learn the system, its worth it. NOBODY plays real-time. Just don't.
5154	0	a	Well I thought Origin asked too much (aka EA) when it comes to their microstransactions for all their games. While the client for the game might be free for Raceroom. The rest of the cars and tracks (you get a handful for free) cost approx $3/$5 respecitvely. Mind you it is just 1 Model of Car, not variations, like all BMW's M Class. Now the tracks probably are reasonable, but I have not bought 1 to see just how close to the real thing they are. If they are like the included tracks that you get for free, I might be able to see buying a track. Right now you can probably with the Easter Sale pick up 4-5 cars for around $6, tracks maybe 2 for the same $6.   Note, if you have money in your Steam Wallet, you can convert them to the currency used to buy the tracks and cars.  So I would wait and see if they do any really special promotion with multiple cars for a low price. The DTM package, has 3 cars, with multiple paint schemes/team versions, but I don't know if that is really worthwhile. They do include several tracks in the package. So for right now, with the game still, sort, in a beta to release candidate status, depends on who you talk to and what you consider aa final release. But you can clearly see they state 'Open Beta' as of April 10, 2014.

4556	0	a	It looks good. It runs relatively well (when you can defeat the twin bosses of patch updates and network connectivity issues). However, as I won't shell out an excessive amount of money to unlock the full 'experience', this game isn't for me. I understand that you get what you pay for, but I'd rather drop $50 on a solid racing sim instead of being nickle and dimed for half a game.

4599	0	a	Its fun, you can use controller for this and it is very sharp and visually pleasing. However, the biggest problem is you can only get so far before you realize you must pay alot of money for new car, vinyl and track. There is no earn yourself a new ride with dedication and racking podium finishs. you spend the money just to race with new vehicle or tackle a different that was not already given to you. if you hate to pay-to-play... please stay away from this game it is no for you.  Not to be recommended to the Need for Speed (of any kind) / arcad'ee kids. If you were looking for alternative to Forza Motorsports on Xbox or an answer to Playstation's Gran Turismo, u may survive. This games mechanics and handling is similar to the console sim racers, but this PC sim is way much more serious then the console racers. this serious racing sim has a massive leaderboard filled with nothing but competitive times that other user across the world have placed. it more fun to race against ur friends times then some â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ pro race driver from Germany. it will be a pain in the â¥â¥â¥ if u hoped to be immersed in the game.  Again, the controls are solid, the game is sharp and presentable. but the pay to play more will most definitely kill your good vibes.

4468	1	a	In short: RaceRoom Racing experience is a great racing simulator to those looking for cut-throat competitive AI in offline racing. The multiplayer is shaping up to be great, but in its current Alpha state it's not quite there yet. If you're on the fence, try the free content first and if you're looking to spend a few bucks, consider either DTM '92, ADAC GT Masters 2013 or 14, or the WTCC '13 pack. Money well spent. Look below the review for a comprehensive list of Pro's and Con's after the verdict.   Visually  R3E is a competitive title, on par with Assetto Corsa. Track textures and detail are what you expect them to be in a 2014 racing sim. Everything looks quite sharp and well detailed. Car interiors are nicely modelled as well, leaving only very few wishes to be desired. A few upcoming titles might look a bit better, but we'll see to those as they get released.  Ligthing, color and saturation in R3E seem very life-like and real. Lighting conditions can be selected from one of 5 presets: Sunrise, Morning, Noon, Evening and Sunset, with full real-time transitions coming later down the road.  In the  Sound  department, R3E really starts to shine. Or roar. Compared to other simulation titles like Assetto Corsa, Game Stock Car Extreme and rFactor2, the cars and engines in R3E sound like they have the punch they claim to have. The sound has just the right amount of reverb to immerse you and make you think you are sitting in fact inside of the car you are pretending to be driving at your PC.  On the  driving  side of thins, there is a lot of good to report as well: The physics feel similiar to other hardcore racing sims like rF2 or GSCE. It becomes immediately apparent whenever you push the car too hard, resulting in oversteer and overshooting a corner or massive oversteer and spinning out - or if you are lucky - just a major slide of the ideal racing line.  The game does communicate what is going on under your car really well through the  Force Feedback . With a little practice you can judge pretty well just by feel if you are about to lose the rear of the car, or whether your rear tyres have just locked up. This is really important in a racing sim, and in this regard R3E is comparable to Assetto Corsa and Game StockCar Extreme, but still a little off from rFactor2. To be fair, the FFB in rF2 is unmatched by any other sim.  If you're not up for racing against other people over the internet, R3E's AI will give you a good challenge. They can be either set to a fixed difficulty level (from 80 to 120%) or alternatively to Adaptive AI, which will ramp up or soften the difficulty depending on how well you do against the AI. In general, Adaptive AI is pretty good at giving you just the right challenge. You have to work really hard for a Victory, but at the same time the AI don't leave you in the dust and you always have some other cars to race against. In their general behaviour the AI race hard against you, but fair. They don't bump you out of the way, but they will use gaps to overtake. They will defend their position with defensive lines and not just stick to a single racing line. (I'm looking at you there, Gran Turismo.) In comparision to Assetto Corsa, the AI in R3E is more aggressive, but still fair.  Unfortunately the game is missing an AI agression control, like rFactor2 and Game StockCar Extreme have. I'd like to tweak the AI not just in skill, but also in agression.  Now, some time for  Multiplayer!  There are no dedicated servers available yet, so you have to hope that your favorite track/car combination is currently running on a server hosted by Sector3 studios. The servers are 'jump in and drive', meaning that if you don't pay attention you might end on a server that has just finished Qualifying and you start a race from the back of the grid. Netcode in Multiplayer is really solid. No cars warping around, no â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t contacts and bumps between cars that are 2 meters apart on screen. The community is okay, you get the occasional idiot who wrecks half the field and other people rage quit whenever they lose too many positions for their tastes, but additional features like ranking systems and wrecker bans are on the horizon for the Multiplayer, as well as Dedicated Servers for everyone.  Now for the most controversial part about this simulator:  The Store &amp; The Pricing : Out of the box you have access to two circuit tracks, a hillclimb track and a bunch of cars from different classes. In my opinion that's decent content for a free portion of a game. Some people might disagree, but everyone is entitled to their opinion I guess.  Tracks and Cars can be bought with  Virtual Race Points  or  vRP , and after the latest update with hard earned cash directly. This alleviates my previous criticism about having to essentially give Sector3 free money in exchange for virtual currency. Prices are not that cheap, but they are reasonable. A new car or track will generally set you back 2â¬ to 4â¬. You can get bigger discounts if you buy more stuff in bulk, or if you get stuff in packs: The DTM '92 pack with it's 5 cars and a ton of liveries is ~10â¬ compared to ~18â¬ when you buy them all individually. Additional discounts are granted to everyone who owns cars and tracks of a new pack: For example, I get a huge discount on ADAC GT Masters 2014 pack, because I already own most of the tracks and cars in R3E already. I think that's a fair system.  There is an option to  Test Drive  all the cars on the RaceRoom Raceway that is included in the game. You can also take part in the free competitions that are changing regularly. Those competitions feature a rotating set of cars and tracks. You don't have to own them to drive them, and if you're fast you might even win a prize!  Recommendations for your first purchase(s):  * DTM '92 pack (5 cars with a lot of liveries) * DTM Experience 2013 (3 cars, ton of liveries, 9 tracks) * WTCC 2013 pack (5 cars, ton of liveries, 3 tracks) * ADAC GT Masters 2013 (7 cars, ton of liveries, 6 tracks)   Verdict : If you have tried this sim half a year ago, please do come back and try it again! The driving physics and Force Feedback have been vastly improved, along with the new and fairer store pricing &amp; discount system. R3E drives just as well as Assetto Corsa, rFactor2 and Game StockCar Extreme. It has the best single player AI on the market, apart from GSCE and the largest selection of content (sans Modding) of the currently availlable sims.   Pro's  * Good Graphics * Great sounds * Very competitive AI * Good driving physics and FFB   Con's  * Multiplayer a bit bare-bones at the moment * Game can get expensive if you want to have everything
4766	1	a	This game looks awesome and its free. Free is never truly free, but that is the marketing model.  This game will continue to develope for years to come. This game has come a long way since 2009. Thats right, 2009. its been reworked alot of times, and its always getting better.   This is one of the most fair free to play models in the market. Each track takes hundreds of hours of work. Some of the newer tracks have the cost of laser scanning on top of the time to write it.   Nearly every game out today sells dlc. This base game is free. You $40 to $60 ahead just for trying it. If you like it, then get what you like. If not, at least you did not blow $40 to $60 for a game you only play once in a while.     The cars that come with the game are good enough to get a feel for the game, but if you like the game your gonna need to buy the tracks and cars you want. There are packs available to save you some money. You will probably spend $60 to $80 for the content you want if you like the game. All the content is about $250 or so.  I used this on my Fanatec Wheel, and my x360 controller, both play well.  At this current time most of what this game has to offer surpasses every other sim I have played including A/C. When A/C first came out, it had this beat. Now with a few updates later, it is better both graphically and in terms of physics.  I only wish the game had Daytona Road Course.  I have been a supporter of this game long before it was ported to steam. About 2009 or so. This game really does continue to get developed.

4758	1	a	There seems to be a lot of negative reviews on Steam about this game, especially revolving around the pricing structure, and while I agree that the price looks quite high I have to say that I think the items are so good that to me they're worth the outlay. You get what you pay for and the quality here outshines any misgivings regarding prices.  Graphically it's stunning especially with everything turned high and running at 60fps with 22 cars on the track, for which I'm referring to DTM experience, but the hot lapping in the base game with Ai turned on gives you an insight into what the finished game will feel like and in my opinion they have got it spot on.  I can only assume that the base game is yet to be optimised because I get lower FPS on the same tracks, with only a couple of cars out than I do with the 22 cars in a full race of DTM. Same graphics settings for both but with a 10 fps drop in the base game? Sounds are incredible, I've never been so engrossed in the sounds of any game as this one and playing with headphones on just highlights the beauty of these cars. Gameplay is great especially on the Get Real setting, althought the Ai needs a little bit more speed as its currently too easy to catch and overtake. I'm currently using a Razer Sabertooth gamepad and once setup it works perfectly but I can only imagine how much more fun a steering wheel would make this and it's the game which will likely push me to make that commitment.  It's that good that I've bought pretty much most of the buyable stuff, except for a couple of livery options, within just a few days of trying it.  EDIT : May 26th 2016  After having set myself up with some decent hardware to get the most out of driving games I can say that this is my favourite driving experience on the PC. I own most if not all of the PC racing sims but there's something about Raceroom that makes it very special to me, and that's the feeling you get from the overall atmosphere that this sim creates. From the sounds to graphics to driving feel, once set up correctly this is such a cool experience with AI that can keep up and give you a thrilling racing experience.

The UI is all over the place--it is easy to tell that it was designed for a steering wheel, but why does the main menu look like a messy CS:GO buy menu?, the game's overall atmosphere, the levels and lack of sound effects (other than the exagerated car noises)--makes the game feel lonely and soulless--even the in-game messages feel robotic. and remind me of The Office when Dwight makes a birthday banner that simply reads, 'It is your birthday.', and finally the fact that any other car or track other than the one they give you is prompted with a overlay to purchase in-game funds make this game feel like a cash grab. Sad.

This feels like GTR!', then Googled the company and realize - it's Simbin!  The physics and force feedback is way better than Assetto Corsa, my previous favorite sim racer. And like I mentioned, the sound and sense of speed, is insanely good. Also this has more and better tracks. AC has modding, but I want good and solid original content, which Raceroom really has.   The pricing model is indeed stupid. Though apparently they have massive sales over the year, I heard you got the entire game for like $50 last Black Friday.

5440	1	a	Graphics, game concept (Carrer Mode), level of playing are good but not very competitive and challenging after initially few weeks.  Devs have giving good precious in new stuffs like hawk eye, DRS, the stumps camera etc but graphics has disappointed. Repeated commentry lines makes me turn off my speakers while playing.  Somethings are unrealistic and frustrating, I play national game in India as well as play county game at the same time. Striker (batsman) play defensive shot of the last overs (while needing 3 runs to win of 2 balls)  Having said that, Its one of the best cricket games for PC, Good Game but needs a lot of fine tunning and more response from the developers or interactive game developers in the forums.  Tons of questions and suggestions are unanswered by them in the forums. We are kept in dark regarding the next update or what to expect in the near future in terms of game patches.  FYI, last patch was updated 3 months back, and no signs of new patches - makes me lose interest in playing these days.   Still I Would recommend the game, just for the expreince of carrer mode, seeing yourself play from club team to captaining the National team (lol in 2-3 season).

5529	1	a	Blood Bowl is a game that exists. You can play this video game, if you wish. In this video game, you command a bloodthirsty team of muscular men or busty women or weird monster things or a combination of all three and have a friendly toss-about of the old pigskin with another team. Oh sure, occasionally someone's arm breaks, or their eyes are gouged out, and in certain circumstances a player dies, but these are all minor details to be overlooked.  This is a turn based take on American Football with fantasy teams and themes, accompanied by an ungodly amount of violence, cursing and Big Moot sandwiches.  I'm not sure what more to say. It's an incredibly fun game solo and it's an incredibly fun game with friends, and a very nice take on the tabletop original game, bringing more content to a more accessible medium of gaming. Games also don't take nearly as long and the game does all of the tedious dice rolling for you. No, the game doesn't hate you, the dice does. No, it's not rigged. No, you can't roll the dice yourself. No, it's not the game's fault that your wood elf failed his dodge and is now laying on the ground with his spine shattered in several places. It's your fault. You â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up. Get good. Get Blood Bowl!  ..  God, that was awful. 10/10 game though.

Just go and jump with AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!! for the awesome =D

4452	0	a	RRE is a very good game - the physics and everything seem to be spot on, but I can't recommend it due to how the purchasing system works in combination with other factors which mean you don't get your money's worth. You'll have to spend well in advance of Â£50 to enjoy most of what this game has to offer and while that in itself is not much of an issue, the fact the server framework seems totally unreliable means you'll be sitting around twiddling your thumbs a lot of the time.   Sometimes the game won't work, sometimes it will. Your friend just down the road from you may be tearing his hair out because he can't get the game started after the latest patch, though it could be you doing the very same the following week while his game miraculously comes back to life. Throw in the Diablo III-style 'always connectedness' (where you simply have to be connected to their servers even for single player games) and what you have is a game that can be thoroughly frustrating.

5511	1	a	 Blood Bowl: Chaos Edition   Many people will tell you that Blood Bowl is unfair. Other people will tell you the RNG is rigged. Yet other people will defend it with their lives. Blood Bowl is just not a game that respects you, especially if you go out there and try to win by murder. It will spank you, waterboard you and then anally invade you with spiked baseballbat that has glasshards glued on for good measure.  I have had my trial by fire on the boardgame and got butchered by experienced players. It was enough to not want to play anymore, mostly because of the discussions with the rulebook in hand. Yet, I was also constantly drawn back to it until I got absorbed by Epic and built myself a nice Eldar army. But then I got the 360 version and was hit over the head with a game that applies the rulebook to a fault. No more sneaking stuff past my opponent, no more obfuscating the rules with 'you're interpreting the rules wrong, muppet!'. Instead, I got steamrolled over and over again, until I wised up and started to take the full time allowance on a turn, always trying to get at double dice on every action that needs them. I begun to make progress, but the on-line was so horrid I turned away from the game.  Today, I decided to buy the Chaos Edition for PC on a whim. Fact is that I'm not that into GW-games anymore. I sold off my hobby some time ago, mostly because I outgrew the demographic. Whenever I walk into the GW-store, I feel like a child-molester for one and inviting a kid over to play a game of Epic just has too many negative connotations to it. Getting back in the saddle was easier than I thought, but much of that is in selecting the team that supports my play-style instead of a team that looks bad-â¥â¥â¥ but is a dog to manage.  Blood Bowl looks very pretty to my eyes. Cyanide did not go for flashy imagery but instead kept it simple and to the point. Game music is likewise utilized and during the matches there is a duo-presentation by two dudes who sadly will have run out of new things to say after you've played a few matches.  I have not yet played with the Blitz rules, opting to play Classic-rules (Read GW-authentic) instead. The Classic-rules play by the boardgame rules and follows that ruleset to the letter, which results in nailbiting matches, as long as you play on Hard. I don't say this to be leet. On Easy, you'll win. On Medium, the AI will anally probe you. On hard, the AI gets slammed by the rules as hard as you are. How that can be, I don't know. The game was like this on the 360 too.  Winning thus depends on team-choice and choosing a team should be a factor of your playstyle. For me personally that meant a choice between the Dark Elves or the Amazons. After having tried a few games with the Dark Elves I noticed that I couldn't pull off miracle plays with them. I like to dodge and play a passing game and the Dark Elves are the proverbial team for that. (Still the best DLC I bought on the 360.) I started over, going for the Amazons this time, who all have Dodge as a natural skill. At first I felt it was hopeless, but slowly I was getting the results. After being butchered a few times, I got a handle on the Amazons and started to fight the AI to a stand-still. Some time later I managed to win a match with a miracle play, passing the ball from the midfield-line to a Catcher in the end-zone.  Blood Bowl is not an easy game. One of the first things a new player should learn is that tackle-zones are the backbone of Blood Bowl. Each pawn on the field has a tackle-zone, consisting of 8 squares around that pawn. Pawns that have overlapping tackle-zone empower eachother, making offence and defence easier. For offence, blocking an enemy pawn is a snap if it has base to base contact with other pawns that are friendly to you. For defence, understanding that tackle-zones are only good for enemy pawns entering it is key.  As you play matches, your players will level up, provided they did something that gives them points. There are many ways a player can get EXP and not all of them are obvious. Blood Bowl does however apply them according to the official boardgame rules (if you play Classic, which I recommend.) and does so rigidly. Should you ever question the game's judgement, crosscheck the decision with the ruleset, which is included in the game. I have not been able to fault it sofar. Leveling your players up will allow you to give your players extra skills. There are loads of skills, but not all of them will suit your players or your style. Take the time to read the description of skills. But most of them are obvious. The first extra skill a Catcher should get is Sure Hands. A Runner should get Sure Feet quickly. A Blitzer should keep an eye out for Break-Tackle.  Blood Bowl comes with a hefty Single Player experience. First there is the tutorial. This is scripted as heck and it won't allow you to experiment. But for new players it does open the game a little, though it won't go into specifics. Therefore it's better to play a few exhibition matches after you've done the tutorial. The Exhibition matches are perfect for experimenting, because they don't have a persistent effect on your team. Work on your starting set-up and watch the AI closely. Here you get the goods on how teams are played, which is unvaluable information for the other game-modes. Many tactics the AI employs are also good to use by you. Begin a Campaign is a set mode where you buy the team of your choice (or field one of your existing teams) and try to reach the top of the different leagues and tournies. Begin a Competion is like the Campaign, but now you set it up to your specifications before you start play. Story Mode is very different as you're free-agent coach who coaches teams that need your expertise. This time, the focus is on you and your managerial skills. And you'll be tested. Hard. World Cup is like the wolfmother of Blood Bowl. Hear you must lead your team to greatness entering nothing but tournaments and your goal is to eventually qualify for the ultimate event. All these modes can't be completed in a single evening. These modes are all in depth and content rich and successfully completing them will take your dedication and test your motivation.  Don't go into this game believing that you'll trash it on your first match. Learn from the AI, see how it handles ball-possession and see how it defends. A wise man once said that no one ever learned something from winning and nowhere is this more true than in Blood Bowl.  -Do safest actions first. -Do less safe actions second. -Do dangerous actions last. -Always guard your ballcarrier. -Buy re-rolls pre-game over stuff like Bribes and Bloodweiser Babes. -Cheerleaders and Coaches are the most helpful during kick-offs. Look for other things to buy first. -Use fouls and bribes to disable enemy keyplayers, like Catchers, Throwers and Runners. Don't waste them on rank and file. -Try to use all your re-rolls in a half, they get replenished at half-time. Re-rolls are instrumental to your play, so don't let them go to waste, use them as needed and don't be frugal with them thinking that you'll get a better chance to use them later.  I love digital Blood Bowl, but the love took a wile to take hold. Blood Bowl rewards the patient, thinking player and it really opens up to those that stick with it and gain skill. Once you get past the disappointment of playing a game that won't let you win and start to recognize what works and what doesn't, Blood Bowl is one of the more rewarding games to play.  For those that want to always win and who want to be leet 24/7, Blood Bowl has little to offer.

The beginning of SpeedRunners is a bit problematic for example it took me a while to figure out how to change the controls. And the story is only useful because of the new characters you can get, but the dialogue is painfully cliche. It's obvious that this is truly a great game but I would only recommend getting it if you have someone else to play with. KILLZONE gives this game a 7/10. Fun.

I'd gladly buy all of the game, were it to be released as a p2p game. Like I said, barely any cars for free, and two, that's right, TWO of, like, over fifty tracks. Overall, I give this game a 6/10, purely down to the realistic physics and the fact that it reminds me of Gran Turismo.

This is true in this game, which is where the leveling up really increases the enjoyment factor. Yes, you don't start out a super-star, your not, you are a rookie, but as you play it, and you improve your abilities, you become one. As you become a super-star, not only are you winning your games, but you are living the life. One of my favorite parts of this game, is how it includes off-the-field perks of being an athlete, and lets you live the life. Great great game, for all the good-sport, sports-enthusiasts out there. The game gives you several control options, my favorite, that worked well for me, was the 'game controller'.

123	1	a	Got this for the steam treasure hunt, spent way too many hours playing it since then. Great game!
4578	1	a	This review has to be a very mixed bag. First off let me say I've been with this game from the start. From closed beta till now. I've seen it go from meh.. to a very decent game. Probably one of the best racing titles I've ever played. I always knew that if anybody could get a racing title right it would be these guys. It has the possibilites of blowing GTR 2 out of the water. Yes it could be that good!  However there are some very serious issues here. One is the pitstops. Flat after the Oct. 20 patch they don't work. I understand that pitsops in custom championships are coming and that's okay. They weren't originally advertsied to begin with after all. I can live with that. Impatiently but I'll live till then. However it's the broken pitsops in ADAC 2014 experience and DTM 2014 experience that upset me. Can't say about DTM 2015 as I don't own it and from the looks of it I may never. Working pitstops were advertised for the DTM and ADAC 2014 cars. Heck I owned the DTM 2013. It was the only reason to buy the newer set.    In ADAC 2014 the player's car drives straight through the pits without stopping. Resulting in disqualification for not stopping. In DTM 2014 your car stops but the pit doesn't seem to count. You guessed it resulting in your disqualification. These were advertised features. We have to assume they had this worked out before the advertised it , right? Guess not!    There are many other issues and to their credit they working on them. As the recent hotfix suggests but it's not enough. One main quirk if you decide to step into this game, is BEWARE THE PATCHES! They generally break twice as much as they fix. One over the summer brought the whole fool game down. In it's current state I couldn't recommend this game unless you are very patient. And it will be tested, trust me! It is a near brilliant racing title with lot's of racing fun though and if and only if you're willing to hang with it you will love it and hate it and love it and hate it.... You get the picture. I gave this title a thumbs up because it doesn't totally deserve a thumbs down! However you have been warned!   As for the 503 errors that everyone is experiencing. I can't say as mine thankfully have been limited. I must be living right or lucky. Also I need to add that I play only single player not multiplayer. So my review can't address any issues there as I haven't seen them. I really would like to give this game a thumbs sideways but can't. Hence the thumbs up.

The short version and all that you probably care about is the fact that... it SUCKS!!! Ok, with that said you can stop reading or continue if you want details. First off, this game is online, LAN, or hotseat only. No singleplayer. Yep, Multiplayer only. Also the interface is terrible, the sound is underwhelming, and the dungeon creator is abhorrent. The only redeeming factor seems to be that the character models are interesting. I am a fan of Cyanide and enjoy Games Workshop, but this game is crap. The only thing keeping me from being disappointed in this game is the fact that I got it as part of a Bundlestar deal where I paid less than $1.00 USD for it.

8	1	a	Basically the most amazing game ever.
259	1	a	A Puzzle game about a base jumping person. Or is it an adventure game. Or one of those arty farty indie 'life story' games about a suicidal person falling to their death and realising how thrilling life can really be when you do something spontanious. Cheered by the thrill of falling, and the daring of spraypaints and high fives from observers.   No idea.  What I do know is this game is a strange kind of fun. The idea is simple enough - fall from a great height and collect as many points as you can before you hit the bottom. Be daring and 'kiss' the lips of buildings, spray paint your logo wherever you can, wave to your fans are you plummett and make that soft landing. The more style you put into each trip to the bottom equals more money; more money equals more goodies and unlocks. Simples.  There's a strange sort of anti-oppression narrative tacked in there too, for those who seek reason for madness. However, it's a lot more fun to just pick up and play this game in small bursts. Long play throughs will probably lead to burn out. No joke.  That's not to say that this game doesn't have it's frustrating moments, but that's more to do with the game's levels and ramping difficulty rather than any ill-fated design decision or game breaking bug.   So, if you're looking for a 'pick up and play' kind of game that can fill a 10-20 minute gap here and there then I do believe 'AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! for the Awesome' could be the game you're looking for. It often goes cheap in the various Steam Sales too, so there's always that if you're really unsure about picking it up.

478	1	a	AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! For The Awesome holds the record for longest game title. All joking aside, this is a game about jumping off of buildings. (Im serious) You have to get the highest score you can by flying close to buildings and making your descent as creative as possible, all while trying not to die at the same time. This game gives you a rush of excitement and adrenaline as you descend between and around other buildings while at the same time playing a rocking soundtrack. Don't worry about a shortage of levels, there are tons! I'm not sure if this has oculous support (not that I have one at the moment), but if it does, this is THE game for oculous. Just try not to throw up. 10/10 would suicide again. Very fun.

The cars mechanics are not that smooth and it can get out of control really easy if you fall off the track just a little. The graphics look decent. The sound of the car are not the best sounding. It has potential though and we will see when the time comes if this game has what it takes to become a really good racing game.

3909	1	a	Outrun your friends in a unique 'racing' game with endless possibilities (thanks to the level editor).  To start off, the visual design of this game is absolutely fantastic- inspired by typical comic book designs and streamlined character spritework. The sound effects and overall sound design is quite nice and really fitting as well. Even though the game uses the same music while racing for the most part, they've somehow managed to make sure that it never really gets old or in the way.  The concept is simple: Run so fast that your friends get ripped into the void and explode.  With an assortment of power ups, tons of both great developer AND workshop made levels- there's almost no end to how much you can play this. Speaking of which, the level editor is great in this game and anyone interested in levels creators should take a crack at this one.  Sometimes you manage this perfect streak of constant speed, from boosters, items, slopes, and grappling (oh yes, the grappling), and it's surprising how satisfying it is to do so. Meanwhile you scream at the top of your lungs SPEEEEEEEEEEEED as your friends get torn apart by the edge of the world eating them alive.  Tons of characters with different colour palettes to choose from so that you can pick your favourite appearance, none of which affect any parameters so there's no concern of character imbalance.  If you're looking for a lighthearted racer and have some friends (preferrably around your same skill level because it DOES matter), this is a must-buy. It's on sale pretty frequently and it's generally pretty cheap too.

121	1	a	This is the greatest game I've played since Super Mario Bros. 2. It features a foul-mouthed degenerate who enjoys jumping off buildings and landing on the hard pavement below.   The game features some of the best voice-acting I've heard in a video game, but what really stands boner out is the games ability to give you a massive gamenema.   I enjoyed this game because it is a good suicide emulator for people who like to jump off high places and flip off walls.   Game gets a 8/10 for having large amounts of falling and that's about all. Also, there is a level where you have to catch falling babies before they hit the pavement, but it's impossible because they have rockets attached to them pointing to the ground below.  I got kicked in the groin alot by the big dinosaurs and uniformed japanese officers.   This game has everything, even a game inside it, it's a game within' a game, kinda like Pokemon Puzzle League.   To quote a great man 'Game is good game'  Get it.
415	1	a	Well, now that it doesn't support the Consumer Version 1 or any runtime past .6, like I don't really have too much of a point to play it. The game itself isn't bad though. I don't recommend it for anyone that heard it supports VR because at this point unless you have a DK1 it doesn't.  I do recommend it for non-VR users though.
3097	1	a	Whether you play with your friends or againt random people on the innternet you're guarenteed to have a blast with this game. That being said, if you ever want to seriously rank up, you're going to need a lot of practice. The skill platforms between ranks in this game increase exponentially.

4404	1	a	An entertaining F1 game, that brings you the intensity of a F1 race and the graphics to back it up. Although, the unaware A.I. and the infuriatingly broken penalty system keep this game from being a top tier racer. ~7.9/10  Pros: -Good Co-Op Career -Graphics are good -Physics and feel of the cars are good Cons: -A.I. -Damage System -Penalty System  All in all, a fun and competitive racing game.

5502	0	a	If you are a cricket fanatic, then yes buy away. Otherwise this game is a bit of a drag.  Whilst the gameplay mechanics are solid, with the notable exception of fielding being bloody awful, the game has some wierd design decisions.  A lot of information is withheld from you without, who's batting? what bowler are you facing? are they left arm fast, medium, slow? What condition is the pitch in? What condition is the ball in? Where are the fielders? Has the career AI captain changed my fielding set up again? (yes, yes he has) Whats the weather for the second day look like? Did my bouncer into the ribs of the batsman do anyting to unnerve them? Is it worthwhile? Should I run after hitting the ball? I don't know because the camera isn't facing the ball yet.  These are questions that you have answered in near any other cricket game. There's no point playing a career game as a bowler if you have no way of knowing what condition the pitch or ball is in, let alone that your fielding setups will occasionally change without your knowledge (minimaps guys comeon).  Some of the above info is accessible, but through many different menus rather than whilst playing it which slows an already slow game down - Except ball and pitch condition, you just have to figure out if the ball will swing or not...  Career mode is a great idea, so so much potential, but the constant loading screens and lack of information about what is happening - plus the fact that a 16 year old is just thrown into first team matches against much better players - make it so frustrating.  Great potential to be an amazing representation of cricket.. But so many odd design choices.

3091	1	a	One of best Indie competition games ! A must-have for speedrun lovers
387	1	a	If you have the original AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! and really want a few more difficult levels, stop reading and get this game. You can even transfer your old save so you won't lose any records.   If you're new to AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!!, it's a game about skydiving off buildings, staying close to buildings as you're falling to collect points, but also trying not to die. You unlock a few neat items like spray cans (bonus points if you tag municipal buildings), coffee (temporary time slowdown), a glove (points if you thumbs-up fans and flip off protesters).   It's a game that kills you for running into things but gives you points for style which requires you to get really close to running into things.   The devs have an odd sense of humor (it seems like a few of the levels are based on in-jokes, one of which is actually explained in an unlockable bonus video). If you're familiar with other Dejobaan Games works, this has the same general tone.  The level system is a bit annoying. Unlock new levels by spending in-game currency, and you only get in-game currency by matching or beating records on previous levels. If you buy levels in the wrong order, you'll find yourself unable to continue because you can't meet the score requirement on the levels you bought and the only 'adjacent' unbought levels are pricey.  In theory you would continuously get better at the game to continue, but in practice it means you're farming easy to medium difficulty levels to squeeze out the last couple points you can. Also, the theme of levels is mostly totally unconnected which means that some levels require entirely different sets of skills (dodging a lot in tight corridors vs. wide open spaces with few point-scoring objects you have to fly to).   However, the levels themselves are well-designed and unique enough to be entertaining, and the fast-paced arcade-style falling mechanic feels really fluid.   One other thing the game has going for it is the art style. It's bright and colorful and in-your-face, which fits with the gameplay seamlessly (though some might find it a bit over-the-top).   Ultimately, watch a video of the gameplay and imagine about 100 levels designed around the same central theme.  If you can get it as part of a bundle or on sale, it's definitely worth it.   If you like the fast-paced feeling of rhythm or racing games and enjoy arcade-style skill-based point collecting, this is definitely for you.

5379	1	a	This is the best cricket game ever developed.  When i first played it, the experience just swept me off my feet. I was thinking if its really possible to develop a game with so much realism.  Batting seems as if we're really doing it. In order to score runs, you've got to apply yourself. Also one could play all the possible shots in the cricketing notebook.  Edges are very realistic which was never done before in any game.  Fast bowling is a real charm with all the subtle variations possible. Although spin bowling bores me personally, its also good with all real variations.  Overall, Its an excellent game which must not be missed.

1480	1	a	After all this time, this game is still fun 2play with your friends. One of the best indie games that achieved great success
5185	0	a	The game was fun, but it ask too much for a computer, even a good one. The control are ok, but it having too much options and it pretty hard to memorize 30+ commands here, if you don't have a racing wheel for your computer, you're going to taste the wall all the time. It could be fun to see a gameplay that is keyboard friendly here, because the game seem to force you to buy a racing wheel.   The graphics are great, the 3D models of the cars are amazing, and a lots of polygon are on them, but since they have a huge numbers of polygon, like I said before, even a good computer will suffer from video lagging. Frequent framerate drop also happen a lot(even during the loading screen)! Also, I feel a lot of time that the game look unfinished...  Another thing here is the loading time, you will have so much time to cook a dinner since it took so much time to load!!!!  The sound is ok, but I don't feel like I'm sitting in a racecar(I have a subwoofer, still, the sound have no bass sound). The motor sound flat, and not like a 'ROAR'!!!!  The main menu isn't friendly at all, since with the new update, I got much more trouble to start a race than before, oh, and the stuff that need to be bought, like cars and tracks are not identified correctly...  Another thing that not cool is to play online, you need to buy the DTM experience pack, isn't the game supposed to be free???  I do not recommend this game for gamers that never played racing simulator before, but give it a try, maybe you will like it, maybe not.  I prefer other racing simulator like Gran Turismo or Live For Speed(and LFS is keyboard friendly), but Raceroom Racing Experience is not a game, it a demo with extremely limited content if you don't buy the DTM experience... Search farther on Steam for a good racing simulator, but don't spend any money on this...
5095	0	a	This is the most expensive 'free to play' game I ever wasted my time downloading. Nice job. Don't spend all that money you're earning in one place. I'll take my business elsewhere.

279	1	a	As I'm typing this review, I literally just realized that the 'A's' on the title aren't completely at random, they have a pattern. And that's pretty awesome. You know what else is awesome? This game.   'AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! for the Awesome' is a Base Jumping Simulator developed by Dejobaan Games and Owlchemy Labs, and it has an awesome sense of humor. You may have noticed how much I've used the word 'awesome' outside of the title. That's because it is the best word to describe this game. It's not beautiful, it's not revolutionary, it's not unforgettable, it's just awesome. You know the 'Awesome' smiley face that you see on the internet every once in a while? Yeah, that kind of awesome. But exactly why is this game awesome? Let's take a closer look.   First of all, this game has no story. At all. There is no main character; the game is in first-person so it looks like the person jumping is you! Why are you jumping? I don't know, because it's awesome, maybe? Is there some kind of hidden lore that I'm missing? Probably not, and if there is, it's VERY well hidden.   The presentation of this game is decent. There are no real characters in this game, meaning that there are no 3D models of any creature. So what we can judge is the buildings and structures that you'll be falling dangerously close to (or on to). The great majority of the shapes that you will see in this game are rather basic. Buildings are rectangles; there's some rings here and there; most platforms are squares; etc. Really, the most complex-looking model that you're going to see in this game are mountains. The textures are not impressive or super-detailed, either. The Heads-Up Display isn't anything spectacular or admiring to look at. And actually, it's OK for this game in particular to not look like it was made by Square Enix. Because you're constantly falling non-stop, you will never have time to take an in-depth look at all the objects in the levels. Honestly, it's better that way, because it won't distract you from trying not to fall to your doom. So in short, this game looks simplistic; it looks as good as it needs to look.   OK, here's the important one: the gameplay. In 'Aaaaa! for the Awesome' (that's the short way to say it), the goal is to jump off the building at which the levels starts you on and reach the bottom while making as many points as possible. In order to gain points, you must 'fly near stuff' as the game says, which will earn you 'Hugs' and 'Kisses.' Early on in the game, you will gain the ability to thumbs-up your fans, flip-off angry mobs, and spray municipal buildings with graffiti. A lot of levels also have breakable score plates and special plates that may or may not help you. The controls only consist of 4 keys on the keyboard and the mouse, and it does support a gamepad. But due to the game's simple controls, I don't find a gamepad necessary; the mouse and keyboard work just fine. Whenever you complete a level, you will gain a certain amount of Teeth and Kneecaps based on your score, and you can use these to unlock other levels. Now that I explained the gameplay, how enjoyable was it? Well, the game is fun. The slight feeling of vertigo that you get from falling thousands of meters in the air is pretty exciting. Despite how dangerous and realistically stupid of an idea it might be, you will always want to 'fly near stuff' as much as possible to ensure that you get the highest score, and for those who are competitive, you will probably try one level several times until you see 5 / 5 stars with a huge score sitting beside it. As you progress, the levels will become increasingly more challenging, though I don't believe the game ever got to a point where I just wanted to rip my hair off. But the game is not perfect, however. It is simple and easy-to-learn, but I personally didn't find 'Aaaaa! for the Awesome' to be noticeably addicting. If you want to beat the game in one sitting, you can probably do it in 3 - 4 hours, but it will start feeling repetitive and tedious after about an hour of playing. It's also worth noting that the game will not tell you your score until you finish or fail the level. But probably the biggest problem with this game is the lack of a level editor (at least there isn't one as far as I'm aware). The game offers 81 levels, and that's... sufficient, but I feel like this game could benefit SO much from User-Generated Content! I don't know if the developers are still willing to work with this game, but if they ever come back to it, please add a level editor. But as it stands, 'Aaaaa! for the Awesome' can be a fun game if played in short bursts, but I wouldn't advice binge playing it.   I guess let's talk about sound design for a bit. The game offers a techno-rock soundtrack that fits the general mood and style of the game, but it's not something that I may have a MIGHTY NEED to put on my MP3 player. There are actually a few pieces of voice acting in the game; the two you will hear the most is a man and a woman telling you how many Hugs and Kisses you have. There's also some videos narrated by the developers, and these videos will either be tutorials or talking about random things because yes. Oh, and let's not forget about Kevin... with the news. As far as sound effects go, I think they're mostly stock sounds of angry mobs, cheering, and hitting things. I do think they could have done a better job with those sound effects, particularly when you fall and break every bone in your body. The game tells you that you just broke everything, but it doesn't sound like it.   So all in all, what do I think about 'Aaaaa! for the Awesome?' It's definitely a fun game that does everything that it does good enough, but it's nothing mind-blowing. It knows what it wants to be, and tries to be nothing more. If you like awesome stuff, you'll like this game. And with the added support for Virtual Reality, it makes the game even better for those who own a VR device, though unfortunately that number isn't too high. Mind you, I'm a cheap booger, so I got this game from I believe a Humble Indie Bundle because I wouldn't pay $10 for it. But if you think this game is perfect for you (and specially if you own a VR device), go for it.

4632	1	a	fantastic - this game offers a full-blown simulation game for free ( yes ok the free content is not very much ), it has a very nice feel to the game when driving the cars over bupms and curbs, the way the cars can suddenly bite you in the â¥â¥â¥ when going around a corner is great fun - i cant say how real it is because ive never drove the road version of the cars let alone the racing counterparts! But it feel real to me, also the car sounds are amazing. My favorite of the cars is the classic touring cars. the other great thing is that you really can run this on a low end system because not only is there 15,000 quality settings to adust you can also set the amount of AI cars visible at once - i run at high to medium settings ( with expection to shadows which are off and refection quality, they kill my machine ) with 18 cars visible with a 750ti gpu and a AMD a6 duel core 4.4ghz cpu AND IT LOOKS AMAZING!!! the only bad thing is that most dlc can only be bought with the in game store ( uses your steam wallet ) and the prices are a bit steep if there not on offer.

5174	0	a	This game looked like fun, so I downloaded it. WORST GAME EVER! I have a few problems with this game. #1 I have a decent computer and can run racing games at about medium visual settings. This game i had to lower it to lowest settings and it still lagged a lot. #2 I use a x-box 360 controller with most of my games. this game it kept saying that my joystick was pulling left. I checked it with my x-box and it was fine. I tried with a keyboard but bad control and lag made it super bad for racing. #3 When I wanted to stop this highway to hell , it wouldn't let me. I tried for 15 minutes to get out of the game and it would just do nothing. Its like they don't want you to quit this POS. All together I would give this game a -2.5 out of 10.

5009	0	a	Update to review below: I keep getting spam emails from Raceroom despite trying to unsubscribe numerous times. Avoid.   ----- Game is a half decent driving sim but is ruined by the fact that anything that goes wrong leaves you facing the wrong way on the track. I can understand it happening sometimes, but when it is everytime something is badly wrong with the physics engine.  For reference I have played iRacing and Project Cars with steering wheel so know what end of a car is what.

4615	1	a	EDIT: Here's my video review of R3E after playing for a month:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91oxmTnvR1k   First, I'll address the nay-sayers problems with the 'pay wall': Go to the RaceRoom Shop (not the DLC Store) and purchase your vRP credits there. With $65 you can get 10000 vRP which is *much* cheaper than buying it in-game or using Steam Wallet and you'll be able to buy pretty much all the content in the DLC store. Next, wait for things that you want to go on sale. Test drive the cars that you want to buy in-game first to make sure you like them. Please note: you *do not* have to own all cars in a class to race against a full field. If you only like the Corvette Z06, then just buy the one or two liveries that you like and when you race against AI, you'll still see McLarens and Mercedes-Benzs out on track. I picked up the ADAC GT 2014, WTCC 2015, American Track Pack, and Audi Sport TT Cup 2015 (one livery) for $27. That's *very* reasonable for a dozen tracks and a dozen cars and a few dozen liveries.  Last note on the DLC: *do not* purchase the DLC through Steam as the discounts don't apply there.  Now, as far as the driving, the FFB is detailed and informative with many settings to adjust how much each effect is weighted in the steering. You can also define clutch bite point, clutch and brake sensitivity, dead zone, upper and lower limits, as well as tune the shifter debounce timeout - and many more options. The graphics are good and the sounds are great - you can tune how much suspension squeak, tire scrub, transmission whine, etc. The AI are generally pretty good and make for a lot of fun in tighter races. I haven't tried out the online functionality.  Aside from the Portimao circuit and Lakeview Hill Climb stage, all of the free content is pretty boring and doesn't do a great job of selling the sim's potential. The Audi Sport TT Cup 2015 car is what really sold me on the sim and with its push-to-pass 10-second boost system it makes for awesome racing.  The main downside to this sim is that it *requires* a 100% always-on internet connection to the Sector 3 servers, even for single player practice. If your internet goes down for a moment or you lose connection for an instant, you're immediately booted out of the game until your connection is satisfactory again. As of this time, there is no offline mode and even slight flutters in internet connection will cause issues. It appears to have something to do with the anti-cheat mechanism they use (there are regular tournaments with leaderboards and prizes, etc) as well as the content management system to make sure you're only using DLC that you own, coupled with the online stats profiling (it logs how many laps you've done in each car at each track, how long you've spent off-track, etc) and the online telemetry upload for replays and such. It's annoying if you don't have a stable internet connection, so keep that in mind.  The sim is quite good with lots of good quality content and highly polished FFB and sound effects. I'm playing with a TrackIR 5, Logitech G25, Renovatio SRD-9c dash, on Windows 10 Pro 64-bit (Core i7-6700, 16 GB DDR4, 512 GB M.2 SSD, GTX 970) on a 34' ultrawide (21:9) display at 3440x1440.

If the  pricing model is putting you off , try the free content for a few minutes. If you like that,  wait for sales . Last black friday you could buy all content for the price of a normal racing game, as if the freemium model wouldn't exist.

4255	1	a	SUMMARY Speedrunners can be really fun as long as you have friends to play with. If you play with your friends, 15e is totally worth cause you can spend a lot of time in it. However if you play it solo, this game actually quite sucks.  88/100  PROS - amazing and fun to listen soundtrack - gameplay is really fun - graphics are simple ( low hw needs ) but they look good - the game has its own physics which make sense and are creative  CONS - the game sometimes doesnÂ´t respect even its physics - I experienced many bugs and internet connection issues which made the game unplayable - almost unplayle on keyboard ( controller needed )
339	1	a	The levels from the first game are beautifully remastered. One of my favorite twitch games of all time. Get it! It's awesome~
5562	1	a	Stomped a player on the ground and got ejected from the game... 10/10  Alot of people say this game is all about luck and rage alot in so many reviews but I brought it anyway and I am glad that I did. Its great fun to play!!  I lost so many matches at first until I watched some games on twitch and realised the game is not about taking chances and taking risks... The game is about RISK MANAGEMENT, forcing your opponent to take the risks and then punching the crap out of them when they pushed their luck and dropped the ball...  This game is really good fun once you understand blocking, setting up players in key positions and protecting the ball when you have it.. the tutorial is crap watch 2 or 3 games on you tube instead then trash the other team with a smile on your face..
4987	0	a	Klunky controls but great graphics, if you got a new pc and want to see it looking great at work download it but otherwise not worth the download. although it is free so it your loooking just to kill time its not the worst choice

If you want to grab a game and play it competitively, this is your game. It won't be long until you see how far you've gotten. Now how do you begin? Well I recommend grabbing some friends and playing with them for a short while so you can get used to the controls and all the maps. As you play through the game you'll recognize there will always be better ways to run them. With that being said now go have fun with this game!

359	0	a	This game is horrible  
5288	0	a	This is an okay game with a bunch of flaws, but fairly easy to win once you have the hang of it and can be fun especially if you played games like footballer of the year back in the day, this is very much an update of that where you actually play the game in full (if abbreviated) rather than just shooting at the goal.  You start off as a lowly footballer who can't shoot, pass, run, dribble or anything. Day by day you can practise, buy toys, go out with the girlfriend (if you have one), try to build up a rapport with your team mates, fans, or boss, etc. Initially the main thing is to build the skills and you do training drills where you have to bend the ball, beat defenders, tackle, dribble around cones, etc. in a limited amount of time/attempts, if you do your skills when you play games improve in the appropriate area.  In terms of playing matches you start off as a sub only having a few minutes, and maybe not being picked at all. Based on doing well in various in game stats you try to get good game ratings, which will get you picked more often, or even a starting position in the team if you keep doing well. At this point you start to having to manage your energy by buying toys to keep you occupied during matches, NRG drinks (which often give you cramps during a game), etc. You also need to spend energy managing relationships if you want your teammates to pass to you, your girlfriend not to dump you, your friends not to hate you, etc. So you get into a balancing act of all these things, and you have to learn how to play the minigame puzzles (pair matching for relationships, 'simon says' for the media), etc.  The main in game challenge isn't really about winning matches, once you know the AIs weaknesses this is fairly easy (for example the quick turn to lure defenders into sliding tackles to clear the way, the banana dribble close to the goalie to lure him out and then walk the ball into the net, the direct vertical run outside the goal to curl into the same side top corner, the diagonal curling out/in balls, etc.). The problem instead is trying to use the match to improve your ranking and stats - so doing lots of safe passing in your own half to build up teammate approval without spending energy, getting some tackles in without getting cards, and otherwise building up your stats for passing/tackles/set pieces to increase your transfer value and wages higher, etc., as the benefit from just scoring more and more goals and winning games is capped - you have to become more rounded to be the best.  Overall the game is quite good fun at times, although it can be frustrating as well, and your team mates need a lot of managing/adaptation to actually be useful to you given how braindead they are, and the out of match stuff makes for a reasonably interesting balancing act. Once you are successful it does all become fairly formulaic however, as once you are fully skilled up and have largely capped out your relationships it is relatively easy to deal with any new off the field problems, and winning matches/championshops/cups is a breeze once you have the skills and know the AIs strengths and weaknesses. I am not sure I would recommend it to most people however at full price, as I doubt most will play it for long enough to really justify the price tag, and apparently it hasn't been on sale for over a year at this point, but this could be a fun game if you like the idea (and have a controller!) and can put up with some bugs/flaws.
127	1	a	A visually stunning game with perfect sound effects to match the gameplay and a great soundtrack. If you love flying or gliding in games, you will love the feel of this game.
538	0	a	This game easily the most brutal and unforgiving game I have ever played. If you can mange to get it to stop crashing and freezing your graphics card, you will be treated to ridiculous elasticy physics and frustrating glitches (like your bike folding in half on a regular basis).  The learning curve is extremely steep, which is reflected by the nearly impossible achievements. In order to become half decent at Trials 2, you will need to study replays and practice infuriating sections of track for hours on end, and even then you have no hope of touching the leaderboards.  So unless you have a lot of time on your hands, and like extremely difficult challenges, think again before you choose this game.
4603	1	a	Racer check this out. The best racing sim at the moment!   Such an immersion gives you none! Sound, gfx and speeeed :D This is really an experience!  For some months i have turned my back and was in iRacing and Loeb Rally. Now after the last patch - 31/3/2016 - my racer heart is pumping stronger :D Nordschleife is out!  The new Nordschleife is a beauty and huuugggeee fun to race online with enough racers! - (btw I prefer online racing).  R3E gives you an amount of content, AI-racing is becoming better and better and you have the mp-part - which lacks of some features so far. With the AI you can race after the patch on SPA and Nordschleife with up to 100 racer grid. Starting from the back and fighting to the leader is fun sometimes for me. Lets hope for a bright online future ;D The multiplayer needs more online racer and more polish by the devs.  The controls are superb for me: In use is here a G27 with a Th8RS shifter and from time to time i like to race in the right sofa-mood with my xbox-controller in 'Sound'-view ;D   Try the free part and there is the possibility to try all cars on one track. Check it out! Absolute worth it!  For more infos visit the devs-forum:   https://forum.sector3studios.com/index.php?find-new/1901361/posts   Have fun!  Harryo  PS: Leave the FOV on 1.0 - real FOV cockpit view - and change the seat-position to your liking. You will have the best feeling so far your screen is big enough ;D   PPS: Just now the devs have released the Audi R18 :D i have to go! Cya on the track and drive with respect online!  Edit: 08/2016  Do you prefer online racing? Check Iracing: way better online system, bigger community and more more social racer.   R3E is for me now in between. Back to iracing for more multiplayer fun.

5303	0	a	Upon first impressions of the screenshots, it's fair to assume that New Star Soccer 5 would be a modern, hopefully deeper attempt at the 90s Sensible Soccer games. Besides the appearance of the match engine, I feel that this game should not be compared to any Sensible Soccer game. New Star Soccer 5 simply does not deliver the same quality of gameplay and overall polish as the 90s favorites.  In this game, there is much focus placed on the life of the athlete you play as. You will be able to choose which skills to train in, you will be able to take part in social activities with friends, teammates, and a girlfriend. You will have the chance to build your relationship with your manager and the fans, and you will also be allowed to spend money on many items and properties. Most of the time, the way you must perform these actions is by playing memory games where cards will be flashed with different images on them, then they will then be flipped over and and scrambled, and you will need to match two of a kind. That's all there is to it, and it isn't any fun.  The developer chose to implement a DRM-like system of player creation and in-game updates where you must manually create an account with a password on their servers, and every single time the game updates after a match, for example, it tries to connect again to their servers. The problem is that the connection to their servers fails almost every single time the game tries to reach them to save your progress. This means that you will need to retry the connection over and over, until it works, each time the game fails to connect to their servers, and it happens extremely often.  The career mode allows for the player to go through a maximum of 20 in-game years, and after that you will need to retire that player and begin a new career with someone new. With your player, you will go through his early development as a teenager all the way to a veteran in his late 30s. There is a simple contract negotiation between you and the clubs, there are transfers, there are relegations and promotions within the leagues, and there are international competitions for both club and country. There are some major flaws with all of these features. Very little of what goes on both in the player's career and on the pitch actually makes any sense. Match ratings are almost totally broken, with the game giving your player a low rating or a high rating apparently not reflecting anything that occurred on the pitch. Your 17 year old player will become club captain and be called up to the national team for doing nearly nothing. It's as if these events were scripted into the programming of the game no matter what you did as a player or how well you played the matches. How well your club performs in cups and championships seems to be artificially altered by more scripted programming, having nothing to do with how well you play or even if you play in the matches at all. Choosing to skip a match and not playing in it makes no difference at all in what happens in the game world or how well your club performs. If the programming of the game wants your club to win or wants you to have whatever random rating, that's exactly what will happen.  The way the match engine looks is what drew my attention to this game, and coming from playing the Sensible Soccer games in the 90s, I was hopeful to relive a modern take on those games. I was very disappointed. The match engine has many problems, including those related to your teammates' and opponents' AI. Everything seems scripted and the other players on the pitch will not do more than precisely what they were programmed to do. Asking them to pass you the ball can produce some senseless and ridiculous moments. Every match played is almost identical to the last, and can be won by using the same exact strategy as before. The controls are imprecise and can be frustrating at times. The shooting and passing mechanics perform inadequately and rarely the way you intend. It's also really obvious that the game is intended to be experienced by people playing primarily as strikers, and secondarily as attacking midfielders. Every other position won't make any sense at all. If you want to be part of the action on the pitch, you will need to travel the entire field and play out of position almost always. Even as a striker and as an attacking midfielder, if you actually want to be part of the match, you will need to run all over the place and play out of position a lot of the time. In addition to New Star Soccer 5 having all these problems and looking and feeling like a mobile game, it's just not any fun. There are rarely any moments where your actions will mean actual accomplishments, as the game is playing itself down to all the events it has been scripted to do.  New Star Soccer 5 is mediocre.

4314	1	a	SpeedRunners is a hype game and a unique one, a kind of game you don't see on the market and will never see again on this kind of scale.  First things first; get used to those slippery controls. I grew fond of them over time, but be aware of the controls. You'll slip and slide everywhere!  Second, this game offers a large variety of characters that, while they don't have any unique powers, consist of things like a DINOSAUR, a CRAZY WITCH CAT GIRL, and yes...OCTODAD. If Octodad doesn't sell this game for you I can't help you.  Third, if you're still reading, the game has many interesting and cool maps to try and memorize that always have some challenge for newcomers and veterans alike. They're all very fun, and have colorful imagery and effects.  Overall, SpeedRunners is a 9/10 in my book. It's extremely fun, and great to play with friends. However, characters should have unique powers, and that's really my only critique. Go and buy it now that it's out of Beta!

524	1	a	Never have I loved a game more. Never have I hated one so so much. Trials can be very addicting trying to get that 'perfect run' but at the same time oh so frustrating when you fall just short of the end. The best part is that it is never the games fault when you fail. And you always know it. It is incredibly rewarding to finally get through a track without falling, or shaving off just a few tenths of a second off of your time. It's a game that you can play when you only have 10 minutes to play, but can spend hours absorbed too. The controls are tight. There are only 4 buttons to push, but control is deceptively deep and nuanced. The crashes can be hilarious. The tracks are well designed and the difficulty ramps up appropriatly from carefree first levels to the insidiously difficult hard tracks. There is a fairly punishing learning curve about 60% of the way through the tracks, but so satisfying when you get some of the more advanced techniques down. Most games I get excited about have a whole lot to do with the story or the atmosphere of the game. This is one of the very few in recent memory that stand pretty much 100% on the merit of the gameplay itself.

5301	1	a	This has been one of my favorite games for a long tim e now. I played this game on mobile and had the most fun i ever could have had on a mobile game. But this...this steps it up an entirely different level. There is no doubt this is one of the best soccer games on the market. if it hadn't have been for this game, i never would ahve gotten involved with soccer so much. 10/10-Would Reccomend

Great stylized graphics (seriously, just watch someone else play and pay attention to the level artwork in the background). A catchy big band soundtrack that's totally unique. Snappy gameplay that allows you to get better, inches at a time.  The most fun you can have with this is to start playing along with three friends who haven't played before. Figure out the game mechanics together and accept your defeats gracefully.

4499	1	a	I've played rFactor2, Asseto Corsa, iRacing and Project Cars as well as RaceRoom. They each have their pros/cons, but for sheer overall experience ('fun') I'll play RaceRoom: Bathurst in the Audi R8 is a blast. The total immersion of sound, force feedback, driving feel, is awesome. As for free-to-play, well, that's just to get you going. If you want a real game, you can pick up a racing series pack for a few bucks that will give you a bunch of tracks and cars along with a mini-career. I've got the DTM 2013 and ADAC 2014 packs, there have decent variety.

19	1	a	First of all: The title is awesome and it's a great example for the kind of humor that Dejobaan Games stands for. Now, what is this game about? There's no real story to speak of. You are some guy, who does BASE jumps from very large buildings. Don't mistake this game for some sort of simulation though, you don't just jump off of real skyscrapers, but rather interesting and fictional constructions and there is quite an array of things to do on your way down. The game is very highscore oriented, so the most replay value comes out of reaching the best score you possibly can on each level and while that could sound dull to some, I really enjoyed playing it.

5245	0	a	This was a very fun sim. Now doesnt even load. Terrible service especially for people that have paid content.,
4652	1	a	Raceroom is a great racing simulator. It has good physics and graphics, and AMAZING sounds. Simbin has done a great job capturing the feel. Now, the downside I'm goign to point out is that this is not entirely free to play. It is essentially a base game with a couple cars and tracks. Extra tracks and cars must be bought. Raceroom is constantly being updated with new content, if you want to buy stuff wait until it goes on sale. Everything eventually will go on sale for at least %50 off. If you ever need any input the raceroom discussion board is a great place as well.   ==In Short==: Awesome Racing Sim, but Not Truly FTP. 
4608	1	a	It was good before, but after the new company Sector 3 got in charge it`s becoming excellent. It`s a simulator not an arcade game.  Pros:  Graphics 9/10 Much Improved lately Physics 10/10 Sound 10/10 Gameplay 9/10  Cons:  No offline mode, even for single player you always have to connect to their servers. Their Servers have sometimes problems and you cannot play it till they manage to repair them.  Content prices are expensive. I bought most of the content on sales  I cannot comment on Mutiplayer as I use only Single Player but heard there are mostly fair players.

5269	0	a	This game appears good at first but quickly became a money swolowing pile of â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ Do download is but do not give these people any money for this pay-to-win crap
727	1	a	People told me before I bought it that this game is a Mario Kart in 2D.  They were totally right. I used to play a lot of Mario Kart Wii when I was younger and got better and better at it with each race I did.   SpeedRunners works a lot in the same way. You'll pass through the same levels over and over again, but you'll always find a new technique to go faster or trick your opponents.   With time, you'll get better and better, and after a few hundred hours, you'll be as skilled as the hundreds of other good players out there. All it takes is some practice.  I love this game. It's so fun and interesting, especially the multiplayer. :3

5512	1	a	If you like strategy and wargaming, you'll like this game. But be warned: it's hard, unforgiving, and frustrating as hell.  A lot of people buy this game without having a background in wargaming type games, and they start thinking the RNG is broken. I can understand that, because it can be frustrating to play well then get your â¥â¥â¥ kicked down the field because of bad dice rolls. But that's how wargames are - you're making strategy based on the odds of the rolls.  If you can get that in your head, then you can start to learn the strategies - like doubling up on blocks to improve your odds. Making use of the special skills of the various players. Changing tactics against teams based on if they pass, brawl, etc.  It took me a good 12 hours to get the hang of it, and I've been playing wargames a long time. I'm finally starting to win against the AI. I played one online game, and they other player mopped the pitch with me, so I need a lot more practice.  But if you have the patience to develop the skills, you'll find this a lot of fun (even though it's very frustrating). I also recommend looking for various online strategy guides that will help you with concepts / tactics like 'The Cage', etc. It reduces the learning curve and makes the game enjoyable sooner.

4750	1	a	I laugh at people complaining about poor optimisation. I run this on an i7 2600k with 16GB DDR3 1600Mhz RAM and 2 780ti gpu in sli at 3440 x 1440 with 20 to 30 cars on grid and average 60 to 80 fps with graphics on max on windows 10.  The game itself is ok and can be fun, granted the handling is average but it is fun. By no means is it a sim, thats another discussion, but if you enjoy driving and have a wheel or controller (the game is controller friendly) then you will enjoy this. Only issue is the dlc but if your sensible and wait for dlc sale in the in game store, you can pickup content as you go for a reasonable price.  RRE isnt my go to driivng game, but it is good enough that I do keep coming back to it.

5524	1	a	If you like Blood Bowl or playing games with turn based strategy you must play that game, you'll love it. If you have not ever played Blood Bowl you should try with this version, keeps the spirit of the game with a great diversity of races and units, with a lot of explanations about the rules. Remember you can download the rules on pdf at the internet for free. There are two ways to play a match: classic (as the original) and 'not turn based', IÂ´ve only played classic one so I cannot talk about the other system. I really recommend it.

4994	0	a	I really thought this would be the next gen Simulation racer that all PC gamers are looking for, while it has all the right stuff, decent graphics, not the best, but much better than the likes of Race 07 and other Sim bin games. The sounds are great too, and the physics are great, but it's missing the most essential element: Multiplayer.  On this basis alone I cannot recommend this game, you can only do time trials so many times and for so long. Another big reason why I won't recommend this game is because, although this game is free to play, the micro transaction system is too expensive. I have done the math and nothing is worth paying that amount of money for, you even have to pay for the realism mode, I mean, who does that on a supposed racing sim?  The free stuff is not enough to keep you going for more than a few hours, there just isn't enough free content to even make this a viable free to play option.  Also, the big attraction to Race 07 and other titles are all the mods you can get, this game does not support modding, so it seems, and you have to pay for everything you want, this I'm sure has detered many previous Sim Bin fans.  If Sim Bin are prepared to drop the prices on all their tracks and cars, and introduce multiplayer, or at least bot cars, then I will consider reviewing my recommendation.  Edit: Even on 50% Easter sale on all cars and tracks, I decided it wasn't worth it. Perhaps if Sim Bin put a 50% discount on the DTM experience, then I may just buy that, as the DTM Experience opens the Beta multiplayer mode.

4480	1	a	This game has been receiving loads of updates recently and the more i play it the more i want to. Plenty tracks and cars to choose from to get you going for free.   The game is very brutal to you for your mistakes. Using Apex Hunt for practise will get you understanding the car and track. Hitting corners within cars capability feels sweet with regard to how you have car balanced in relation to amount of speed, braking or acceleration; depending on the line you take. You have to set the car up for each corner to hit that sweet spot of being in control or not.  Brake too hard for a corner and you will lock up and drift wide until you regain grip, brake to late and carry to much speed into corner you are greatly penalised for your misjudgement.   There are loads of Challenges, Competitions and other race modes.  Still finding new features each time I take time to navigate through all the in game options one of which that caught my eye was the ability to capture video and take screenshots from the automatically saved replays from your best lap time for each car and track combination.  7.5/10   Edit 24/11/2016  This games's physics, look and feel with evreything else about this game has just hugely changed for the better. Brilliant racing simulator. Most defintely worh checking out if you like motorsport.  Like a fine wine this game just improves with age.  9/10

738	1	a	This game is a sorta mix of Mari Party meets Mario Kart meets nearly perfect platforming.  Meaning that it will destroy friendships, ruin lives, make you rekindle them in the same moment, and the entire time you keep going 'just one more round'  A game that on paper I thought wouldn't work but ended up being yet another great title that I played a ton of.   Plays best with friends, but the community is very friendly as well.
16	0	a	Clever title, clever mechanics, clever bits of story/extra material.   There isn't too much more that's good about the game. While it's fun to play for a bunch of the levels, it slowly decends to a kind of perfectionist/point â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ style of gameplay where you can only advance if you play previous levels to excess to get more teeth (in-game currency) and allow you to unlock more levels. I wouldn't mind so much if the teeth values for most levels were significantly lowered, but having to play and 5-star the easiest level 200 times to unlock the next level is tedious. Other than the occasional ARG content, it's not worth playing past a certain point mid-way through what's available and leaves much to be desired.  If you really want to play it: unlock all the little extra videos/audio content first, then see how far you can get. The extra little tidbits are genuinely hilarous by virtue of surreal humor.   Generally: give this a miss.

308	1	a	Fantastic game, and probably the closest I'll ever get to a new Jumping Flash.
5296	1	a	Fun little soccer game, I'm playing it to create a basis for a future character in Football Manager, however there are a few gripes.  probably the most glaring problem is that your teammate AI can be unreliable; like they'll run straight at the other team's player and get tackled, rather than try dodging or passing the ball.  Your coach can be bi-polar sometimes with his game and post-game comments.  ball hit-box is a little funny sometimes, where you won't 'catch' the ball when you thought you would.  The refs though are pretty accurate, even though the game doesn't explain what constitutes a yellow flag (I had to actually look up what they give them for and make a guess)  Don't expect matches to be upwards of 90 minutes either, maximum is only ~15 minutes for a regular match.  If you can get past all that though, you're in for a cute little time-waster.

4451	1	a	Update: This game keeps better and better. The developer is really making a great effort in making this game better with every patch released. Really cool that there are always new packs.   No idea why the mixed review this game got. After the last update (march 16'), this game has to be one of the best sim racing games out there. FFB is just epic and the sound is really top notch. Have GTX 980 ti 6GB so the graphics are really good when maxed out and with fps ranging from 150-160 fps there is nothing to complain about. Also with a huge muticlass grid (99 cars i think) and bmw M6 GT3 (coming very soon), R3E is a must buy for any simracers out there. GTO and formula junior were just released and bmw m6 gt3 coming soon what else would one ask for. And yeah any car can be test driven before buying. Is there any other game that offers this?

Knock all players off the screen 3 times in a row to win.   Speedrunners is truely fast paced. Whilst I have not played the campaign mode yet, I don't think the story is or would be too appealing, and that's perfectly okay with me.  Holy shinoa the artstyle. The game has a sort of comic book or cartoon type of feel, and every level's design has something fresh and new for the formula. Not to mention, this game has integrated Workshop support, allowing any joe-schmo to make very complicated or stupidly easy levels.  God diggity doozle these controls. The controls are amazingly tight and are perfect in competitive modes. If you mess up, that's you.  Overall, Speedrunners is worth every cent. I could not find any flaw and if you want to have a good time with friends, do yourself a favor and buy this.  My (True) rating: 10/10

5319	0	a	Love the game on mobile, they've tried to develop it on PC but they've just overcomplicated it and tried to add too much freedom. The reason people love the handheld version is because it is really simple. Now the game allows you to run around throughout the entire game, which in theory sounds good but it's really poor.  You call for a pass whilst running and your teammates pass behind you then you get the blame for calling for the pass poorly when in reality you're teammate is to blame for the hideous pass. Trying to head the ball is abysmal too. Once you get the ball, you can go on a lot of dribbles and play some nice passes in to your teammates but it's very difficult to tackle opponents and because your teammates can barely pass to you, you find yourself having played 1 pass throughout a game of 90 minutes.  It's cheap so if you enjoy the handheld version, you'll have a voice in your head urging you to buy this. However don't say I didn't warn you!  Oh yes, also the game keeps crashing. I've googled the error to no avail. An exception occurs so perhaps the developers need to try and look into what causes the exception to be thrown.

68	1	a	It's a good game. Not great, but good. It hasn't aged terribly well and/or looks like a student's game, particularly with the models and random other images strewn throughout to try to distract you. There's a lot of replayability though, with leaderboards and really just trying to improve your own skills. It's not enough to keep me playing for that long, but it's a decent romp.

4564	1	a	Gday,I think this game is one of the best if not the best sim i have played.I have put many hours in other sims like Assetto corsa,GSCE,etc,Raceroom has set the standard i think...The sounds in this game are second to NONE,the way it makes you feel you are acually at the track.The FFB and the road feel spot on.If you like simbin games you will love this.It has pitstops and the AI isnt as bad as what people say..it is much better than AC,s AI,but not yet as good as GSCE AI,,this game is still in beta tho,If you love racing sims as much as i do you have to try it out..Its a free to play game with 3 tracks and 5 free cars,The content they have for sale is well worth it,you can also test drive any car anytime before you buy it.The only thing i dont like about this game,and its the only thing,is that you have to be online always..even to play single player, you have to be on the server..I really hope they change this as my internet is not the best all the time.Happy racing......Cheers
426	0	a	This is a game that has a really neat mechanic and idea, but doesn't have the sort of gameplay that keeps me engaged for very long. After playing it for 20 minutes, I feel like I won't get much more out of it. What it does do, it does very well. Maybe try before you buy.

4676	1	a	I stopped played it after couples minutes since I don't like the way to handle the car. It's too stiff, and once I done a wrong control I have to restart the race instead getting back to drive. A car selection is also very limited (without spending money like buy a pack, of course). But it has a good graphic, and the game it self have a potential.  6/10 for me.

5448	1	a	Awesome game. Better than any cricket game I've played. Definitely worth it! Some graphics and game physics can be improved upon but I'm not complaining.  I found a bug with multiplayer mode. When one of the controllers is disconnected, the game stops responding to the other controller. Keeps waiting for the controller to connect again. Also, I noticed that the commentry and player voices don't play sometimes. This happened for 2 entire matches. Hope the devs can get around to fixing that and release a patch.

5486	1	a	This is the best cricket game I've ever played. The batting is balanced: the forward defensive stroke is very safe, while the aggressive shots are likely to end in you losing your wicket - you are rewarded for playing the right shot in the right situation (as opposed to blitzing every ball for six Ã  la EA Sports Cricket). You have little time to react to a fast ball, and split-second decisions are required, just like in real life.  The AI is reasonable - the fielding positioning is questionable, but the actual gameplay is very good. The amount of misfields and overthrows are about right compared to real life. The career mode is fantastic - you control only your player, so if you get out for barely any runs as a batsman, that's the end of your contribution for the innings: you can't then just control the next seven or eight batsman that bat after you. As a result, the games are quicker (you can simulate the bits you're not playing), and your performance is more in the spotlight.  Of course there are a few problems: the commentary is about as wooden as the cricket bats, the animations are a little bit glitchy from time to time (certainly nowhere near EA Sports Cricket or Ashes 2013 levels), and there may be a slight mismatch in run rates between the simulated and live-mode game. But these are tiny issues against an overwhelming success of a game - especially considering this is Big Ant's first try at a cricket game.  Rating: 8.5/10. Could be improved, but stands up well against any sports game ever made.

5415	1	a	I don't like cricket. I love it.  Bradman 14 is the cricket game that we have been waiting for. That's pretty much all you need to know. Finally a developer has cracked the combination of making a game feel like a proper simulation of the sport. It oozes cricketness. Sure, you can play it like a hit and giggle arcade game if you want, but if you also want to make a ponderous innings in the vein of Chris TavarÃ©, the game is more than happy for you to go out and block every single ball back to the bowler.  The graphics are very serviceable, animations are generally good although the bowling action isn't 100% smooth, with the ball popping out of the bowlers hand at slightly odd angles, I suppose rather a tricky thing to model though when you have to allow all the variations in bowling and outcomes that result. Batting is a real joy, I love spending a while at the crease fashioning a score. And then smashing a ball down a patrolling outfielders throat having forgotten he was out there. Foolish.  Career mode is wonderful. You take control of one person. You perform their every cricketing move, if you fancy it. I generally only bother with batting myself as I am a glory hunter who prefers not to toil too hard. I've not progressed too far, but I am happy in my role as a county cricketer. One day I'll develop the patience and progress to international level. Maybe.  There's still a couple of minor aesthetic issues with the game although the devs are actively patching it at the moment. Hopefully these will get resolved.  Anyway, this review can all be boiled down to this: do you like playing cricket games on your computer? If so, buy this, you can't go wrong. Simple.

551	0	a	Playing Trials 2 is like going to a restaurant, and ordering the chili.  First, you're impressed. It's pretty good! The meat is tender, the onions and beans are flavorful, the broth is robust.  Then, the cook comes out and adds some Cayenne pepper, to give it just a little spice. Superb! Well done!  And then the cook comes out again and adds some more Cayenne pepper. Well, I mean... why? It's quite good the way it is. You can still taste the other ingredients, and it's not bad, but things are kind of getting overwhelmed by the spice.  And then the cook comes out once more and dumps a gallon if Cayenne pepper into your dish. Now you're irritated, but you know there's good chili in there, right? You take a bite, and try to ignore the spiciness, but even when you find a great big chunk of meat or something, all you can taste is spice. Spice, spice, spice.  Difficulty is good in a game. A little spice is more than nice. But when your game's gimmick is that it gets so difficult that you can no longer taste the enjoyable stuff, well... what's the point? Who wants to eat THAT dish?  A bad chef is one who sucks at chili. An unforgivable chef is one who ruins good chili. The same goes for game devs - good game, ruined because some idiot was all like 'XTREEEEEEEM MEANS HARD, RIGHT?' I will not be purchasing any games by Red Lynx again.
4483	1	a	Great game, almost up there with titles like Asseto Corsa, rFactor2 and iRacing in terms of realistic driving.  One of the most immersing sounds in this genre, and nice looking graphics.  It's F2P but the price of the content seems a bit higher than it should be.  8/10

5027	0	a	Just another free to play game that isnt free to play - you download a huge amount of data to race a few cars and even fewer tracks - Its not even a good sim (I never felt that RACE07 was a good sim, and this just has the same problems, multiplied). The cars have way too much grip and way too much oversteer - braking is always assisted and the cars are far too stable to feel like racing cars. Unless you have deep pockets, suck at racing sims, and want to feel like youre accomplishing something, just steer clear of this one (no pun intended).
274	0	a	Buy this if you think Microsoft Excel is too exciting for you.  Seriously, very sorry to say, but I think it's an absolutely horrendous game. Zero excitement. Zero. Bad graphics (worse than many cell phones today). Zero thrill. Insanely boring.   Gameplay goes like this:  -&gt; you walk (more like slowly inching your way) off a 'building'  -&gt; you 'fall' (more like slowly drift) towards something supposed to be downwards  -&gt; you steer clear of stuff (big blocks/pixels) on your way down, and try to hit various targets on the way down etc.  -&gt; you deploy your 'chute' (which is stated to be a helicopter-thingy?) and land  -&gt; repeat ad naseum.  No render of a ground or imminent dangers. Just blocks and stuff magically hovering in mid-air on your way down. No resemblance to an actual base-jump, or parachute-jump for that matter, whatsoever. You can unlock different places to 'jump'.   Why not make it go fast, like a real jump? Why not add the whooshing sound of air, or add the instability from the air resistance that rushing towards the ground gives you? Why no content or graphics? Why doesn't anything look like real buildings, or real persons, or anything real? I've tried countless games, in a broad spectre of genres, all the way from the Sinclair ZX and Commodore in the 80s, but this really burns itself on the retina and memory as a really, really bad gaming experience.  I will, however, not tell you how this game is with Oculus Rift, because I haven't tried it. Maybe it's better? Could be. Seriously, it could be. Maybe the VR-goggles can transform crap to tolerable.  Personally, I doubt it. But hey, each to his own.
5514	1	a	It's Blood Bowl. What's not to like. Haven't tried the fancy 'Blitz' rules - just playing the Classic game.  If you're a fan of the 'real' Blood Bowl, but can't paint a figure to save your life (like me) or have no friends (like me) or don't have time to set up the table all the time (like me) or just want to sit down and have a quick nostalgic game of horribly wonderful how-can-the-dice-always-come-up-to-my-disadvantage-at-the-most-crucial-moment-in-a-drive (like me) - don't miss out.  Single player is surprisingly enjoyable and competitive - and there's hot-seat multiplayer, so you can deal out some Norse-style smash-mouth Blood Bowl on the big screen in the living room too.   This is Mario Kart for people who never had a Nintendo. Gratuitous swearing, cursing, beer-drinking and Pantera-listening goes very well with this game.

My racing group and I bought in only when the 80-90% sales were on. Simply put the pay-to-play 'free to play' nonsense ruined what should have been a serious contender for Project CARS, AC etc. It has the quality to compete, but the purchase model is stupid.  No AI use in multiplayer games also diminishes the appeal. The tracks are nice but the environment is very sterile (akin to Assetto Corsa). Great controller options and technical options but doesn't deliver much in the way of envirionmental options, etc.   This is the game which should have been great. We all openly agreed we'd have paid a normal $60 pricetag but everyone I race with is turned off by the silly pay-per-car junk. That's the only reason I can't recommend this unless you stumble upon one of their big sales.

Pros:  - So much more than just a soccer game (includes casino games, horse racing, mini games, etc.) - Basic graphics than can run smoothly on any computer (think NES/SNES) - Simple controls  Cons: - Some of the achievements don't register on Steam (not a big deal for me, but to some people it might be) - Sometimes it can be a little difficult to control your player since the controls really are simple  All in all I would highly recommend this game. 9/10
4665	1	a	8/10 for a beta its OK but I really hope to get more tracks soon. and more cars....   loads of fun for a noob like me . the hill climbs are relaxing . the UI is good . could use some hover tool tips over the more advanced settings .

313	1	a	Let's pretend for a moment that you want to make a video game. Let's also pretend that you don't have any 3d modeling or artistic ability whatsoever. How do you resolve a conundrum like that? Simple: abstract art!  This is the approach that the developers of AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! for the Awesome took when developing their base jumping simulator. There's a certain edge to the game, certainly, and it's got some style, but I just can't get over the fact that it'd be a lot more fun if the buildings I was flying past at high speeds looked like actual buildings.  Also, the buildings float, because this is the future. And because this is the future, base jumping is obviously now the way that you're going to take down the evil authoritarian government that somehow took over. Presumably you're angry because of the flying buildings...who knows?  Still, it's fun for a bit as a sort of combination racing/puzzle game.

It is really handy if you want to make a decision for example you want to decide wich game you play the guy who wins chooses the game. 4 pack recommended but if you want to play online it's also fun because you can rank up. And the developers are interested in your experience for example map making contest!

4489	1	a	R3E is really a terrific racing sim! It was perhaps launched too early with many features lacking or functioning badly, but recently, though still in beta, it has really delivered in my opinion.  I also have the 'other two' contemporary racing games, AC and pC and I must say that I find R3E most fun of these three. For example, I think BMW M1 Procar is even more fun to drive in R3E than it is in pC which I find a blast in pC also. R3E is not perfect, at least yet, but it surely has its strengths. Sounds are just awesome and with the recent 9GB 'patch' they got even better. FFB is also best of the three games and it deliveres the road feel really well and doesn't even require hours of tinkering with settings to get it right. AI is also the most competent of the three by a big margin, so R3E is perhaps the best choice for the single players at least until AC and pC improve their AI algorithms. Graphics are also quite good, although not on par with pCars, but on the other hand, R3E runs also very well on my three monitor setup.  But hey, physics are the most important thing, no? Here R3E fares also well. Physics aren't perhaps the most accurate on the planet, but still very believable and with awesome FFB I like the driving feel a lot. I say it again, I think R3E delivers the most fun experience of the three. Still, R3E is by no means arcade racer and leans heavily towards simming side of the genre.  As said and at the time of writing, R3E is still in beta and a work in progress. It is still quite polished and offers pretty much full experience already. It has no weather or full night, but it is otherwise pretty much a full deal IMO. Things I dislike the most are annoying load times, which surely improved with the latest patch, but are still on the annoying side especially on the menus. Micropayment system is completely a matter of opionion and it really doesn't bother me. You can have just one experience set and that gives you several tracks and a class of cars and that's basically all you need. If you wan't more, different packs give good value for money and you get discounts for the packs of the items you already may own.  If you like sim-like racing games don't hesitate to try the R3E. You can do it for free, but of course with very limited options for driving.

4693	1	a	Hey everyone,  RRRE is worth your time.  RRRE is a absolute hidden treasure of a racing sim buried under a unattractive business model and hidden behind terrible loading menus. (i believe soon to be fixed) Dig beyond, and you will be rewarded, handling, dynamics, visuals, sound. It has it all. Its also beautifully optimized and can run well (and still look great) on older rigs, but when you have the horsepower crank it up for amazing visuals. This game has continually gotten better and better as the SIMBIN team from the great Race07 continue to work and improve this absolute driving masterpiece.  Do yourself a favour pic up Hockenheim in sunset with some gt3's and just sit back and enjoy.  dig.

4147	1	a	This game has been an amazingly pleasant surprise. I picked it up in a Humble Bundle and forgot about it. I had some friends over for the weekend a few weeks later and randomly remembered it. We fired it up, and proceeded to play from 8pm until 6 am. Since then, they've all picked it up and we play several times a week. The game is full of laughs and subleties you would never expect! I still find ways to go a little faster and boy does it feel good when you hit that super speed and keep it going for several screens' lengths! Play with friends and don't start without them! Learning Speedrunners alongside a group of friends and laughing it up is some of the most fun I've had in months!
136	1	a	Funny, off-beat, slightly weird, and definitely insane, AaAaAA!!! is worth every penny just for Nebin the radio announcer alone. The levels are fun, twitchy, demanding, and always something different. With titles like: 'Crandall Tower now with Extra Pea Soup' and 'The Illuminati are just People with Lamps' the game is a treasure trove of non-sequiteurs that is perfect for 3am gaming when the insomnia is making the hallucinations kick in.
518	1	a	OMFG this game is reeeeealllllly hard......it makes me almost cry. But if you like challenging game, this is right decision for you. This game will show you what is challenging.
4641	1	a	First of all i want you to know that ive tried every other Sim out there, Iracing, Rfactor 1/2, AC, GSC and other older titles.  This for me right now is the most promising sim out there, the packs it has are really good, DTM, WTCC, ADAC, DTM 92, Group 5 cars.. awesome. I would say the content they have is only rivaled by iRacing.. however this sim is a whole lot cheaper.  The physics are very good, the graphics are some of the best (forget Pcars, that is not a sim) and the sound and immersion are THE BEST.. there is a truly great comunication with the developers and the content/updates are coming out at a great pace.  Try it out.

4467	1	a	Gameplay is awsome. Sounds are awsome. I dont recommend you play this with a keyboard tho. You can join competisions and championships online that update all the time. They have a replay system built in thats super easy to use and actually works really well. The game is free but only comes with 3 race tracks and a couple of cars, but buying other cars and race tracks are cheap and isnt really the issue with this game like everyone says it is. To be honest there are no issues with this game so if you feel like geting into sim racing but dont feel like buying assetto corsa or anyother game, then I strongly recommend downloading this, and also, Ignore the hate. All hate for this game is because people are to cheap to spend a couple of bucks for other tracks and cars.
4318	1	a	I've shared many laughs and glorious kills/deaths with my friends on Skype while playing. It's very simple at a glance, but under the surface, there is a lot of strategy and skill.

414	1	a	AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! For The Awesome holds the record for longest game title. All joking aside, this is a game about jumping off of buildings. (Im serious) You have to get the highest score you can by flying close to buildings and making your descent as creative as possible, all while trying not to die at the same time. This game gives you a rush of excitement and adrenaline as you descend between and around other buildings while at the same time playing a rocking soundtrack. Don't worry about a shortage of levels, there are tons! I'm not sure if this has oculous support (not that I have one at the moment), but if it does, this is THE game for oculous. Just try not to throw up. 10/10 would suicide again. Very fun.

81	0	a	Having played through most of this game, I can safely say that I didn't enjoy a single minute of it.  The idea of base jumping through futuristic, laser-skyway cities has some definite appeal, but when it amounts to simply traversing around elongated blocks at a steady pace with some retro acid-trip inspired background trying to compete for eye focus, the product leaves you wanting.  The humor is 'LOL so randum XD' and the devs shamelessly plugged themselves into a number of levels. The game is basically built around high scores, in the same vein as classic arcade games. But when the leaderboards are dominated by hackers (a million points in the tutorial level? Please) with no moderation in sight, that takes out the possibility of an ePeen simulator.  One positive about this game is the level design. Some of the courses are really cunning, and I like game designers that twist and bend the rules of their own game to make a variety of new experiences.
457	1	a	One of the best implementations of a short game for the rift, the levels can seem pretty similar after a bit, and too bad there is not more absolutely crazy impossible levels, but none the less I love this.

You only get three tracks and not sure how to unlock them unless you pay. If you are into paying for stuff in games then you should grab this one if not find something else.

4760	1	a	Bottom line here , Good game , cars , tracks , sound all good , its a sim not arcade type racer , yes you need to buy the tracks and cars you want to race , Yes people moan about paying for the cars and track here is my point of view. Other games your pay 'x' amount for the base game , then pay normally more for the DLC's that follow , Here you are getting the base game , you get a few cars and tracks all for free , you can practise on those to get a feel for things , Go test drive the different disiplines and decide which disiplline you would like to follow as a carreer , then go ahead and purchase that disiplin and track pack for the chosen disiplin , my point is you do not need to choose all the disiplines and tracks unless you want to race in all ,  For me Race room is not a 'ooohhhhhh collect all cars and tracks' type game its a sim and carreer game a game where you follow a specific disipline and go from there be the best you can be in chosing race career ,  so when you get down to it , you get a game 'Simulater' that you can get good at then purchase what you want to , you have choice , becuase there are plenty drivers in each disipline , you dont have to pay for a game then pay the same price and more again for the DLC collection , you pay for what you want and its cheaper then the 'Buy Game , Buy dlc , buy dlc buy dlc , and ,,,,,,,,' you get the picture , buy the car you want in the disipline not need for the whole car pack and the tracks for the chosine disipline ,,,,,,,, we have a game 'SIM' that you can choose what you want to do , other games ulimatley you will buy the game and all the dlc , why ? becuase all your buddy's have and you need the same to play with them , here you and your buddy's will no dought get only what you all are good at ,  Bottom line good game , and ultimatly one of the best sims ever even with the buy in for what you want to do , choice good stuff Simbin good stuff.

This game rocked my sox for a period of a couple of weeks, and again everytime I choose to pop it open. Bright colors, cool music, and incredibly challenging environments would lead me to say that this is one of my favorite games of all time.   TL;DR Buy this!

4454	1	a	Just bought R3E last week due to the black friday deal with all content for 49.99â¬ and must say I'm absolutely blown away by it; it's just a fantastic and truly immersive experience.   This is my first review so felt I had to give my opinion to help balance out some of the redundant criticim and negativity surrounding this game/sim.  Pros:  Sounds (Outstanding!) AI (A lot better than AC or Pcars) Official series Excellent FFB Tracks - although not laser scanned look and feel absolutley spot on. Graphics - Very good, not the best by any means but much better than expected. Great car selection Physics - I'm certainly no expert but has overtaken AC as my new favourite ( Pcars, AC, and Iracing are the only sims I've used)  Cons:  Pricing structure -I only bought this due to the deal making it the same as buying a normal game for Â£40. I'm really not a fan of the free to play model or Iracing's subsription and single content purchasing.  And what's sad here is I almost denied myself a fantastic sim because of this. If it werent for the deal I'd not have bothered so hopefully the developers can rethink their pricing structure and offer the content for sale altogether like a regular game.   This really exceeded my expectation. It's honestly hard to describe but something just feels right about driving the cars in R3E. A real must have in any sim racing enthusiast's library!  Edit: Looking through some of the negative reviews here and many of them are just rediculous. Yes, the game's certainly not perfect but giving negative reviews for the fact that the game 'needs' a steering wheel when it's designed as a proper simulation is just stupid. Also saying the game is â¥â¥â¥â¥ because you have to buy cars and tracks again is just stupid. Do people actually think free to play games are free?? I certainly don't agree with how the pricing model works but I certainly dont expect to get things (of any real value) for free...

So of course some things can't be mapped correctly, and when I try to race, it doesnt let me use the controller for a few seconds so I often start crashed into a wall, then the controlling is terriable.

4662	1	a	This is the best sim since Grand Prix Legends. Simply the most fun you can have with your clothes on. Period. If you love race cars &amp; racing this is as close as you can get to the real thing. They even give you a couple of tracks &amp; 3 cars for free, Whats to complain about. Yes Multiplayer is in alpha. So if you do that then you can expect problems. But the single player game is great against the ai. Works fine &amp; is stable on my Pc. Try it. You won't be disapointed. But as said by others. Buy your upgrades direct from the games website. Not through Steam. You can purchace from your steam wallet. It's not perfect yet there still working on it. But it is good.... Very good! Bought some tracks including one I've actually driven on &amp; it's spot on. When you crash it doesn't even cost you anything!!!! Hell I love this game already &amp; I only had it a few days! Works well with a joystick. So you don't have to spend a fortune on a wheel. Now I've got the thing calibrated good bye life...... :-)  Sure if your looking for arcade forget it. You will hate it. Go and waste your money on something else. Bore your brains out after 15 hours. This will take you that long to get into it. Trust me I'm only just starting. This can only get better, With more tracks coming online all the time it will be alot better. And when they sort the multiplayer........... Bought 7 tracks &amp; 20 cars for Â£20 so don't believe the doom merchants. Much cheaper from the games website than on steam, This is one game I don't mind paying for DLC''s as it will keep the game in developement. Real world physics. Awesome sound that deserves some decent speakers. And after all they give you so much for free. How you can whinge about that. If it doesn't work on your system then at least it hasn't cost you anything. I have paid good money for other race games that won't even run on my Pc or have no controller support. This game is quality.

4573	1	a	YOU SHOULDN'T VIEW THIS AS A FREE TO PLAY GAME.  Yes it's listed as free-to-play but it's really more of a base platform for future games (listed as DLC). You get a few cars and less than a handful of tracks to try out, but the rest of it requires money. You should approach this as something like DCS World, where it's used more of a launcher for other games/addons.  While the whole pay a metric â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥on of money for cars sucks, and something I wish SimBin/Sector3 never did, the actual DLC is topnotch. I wouldn't even call it DLC because the amount of content is equivalent to a whole new game. It still runs on the gmotor/ISImotor engine so graphics aren't the best but it's still stunning and clean. Physics aren't the best and it still feels very gMotor-y, but they still feel amazing to drive and believable. AI reminds me a lot of GTR2, fast, aggressive and (for the most part) clean, they do tend to divebomb from time to time. The thing that stands out the most is the sounds. Hands down the best on the market when it comes to racing sims. You can hear subtle variations in engine tone, track surface, debris and the little squeeks and creaks of your suspension and chassis. You can even tell which tyres are locking up based on sound. Total immersion.   It had a really rough (and imo, horrible) start but SimBin finally got their act together and I'm starting to enjoy it more and more. It's not at the level of AC, iR, or rF2 but it's damn good.

736	1	a	This is another one of my favorite games of all time and I have been playing it since the xbox 360 days. Destroying your friends has never been more satisfying. Also has a friendly community, (not at all toxic) which is a nice change from LoL. With its' full release the game has never been in a better state and I love all the new features it has brought to the table. Would recommend this game to anyone even if this isn't near their taste of gaming. Also all of the workshop content that users make keeps the game very fresh because original maps can get old eventually. Personal rating has to be 9/10 for its' amount of fresh content, trail making, fair pricing, the amount of fun with friends, and replay-ability the game has. (Speedrunners 2, please?!?) Love the game guy!

481	1	a	Fantastic game! I used to get up every morning and drink coffee and play for 20-40 before work. So much adrenaline!  Pros:  Tons of levels (so many it'll take 10+hours and hours to unlock them all) The game starts off a little 'easy' but ramps up in intensity at a very good pace Tons of neat music Weird â¥â¥â¥ relaxation tapes scattered around to help you 'chill out' (and they actually work) FULL of weird punny/awkward things. I genuinely laughed pretty hard at some You can base jump from space! On the idea that we learned how to build on air You get 'bones and teeth' from passing stages to unlock more stages Everyone in the world needs more 'Hug's and Kisses'  Cons: Breaking every single bone in your body I somehow lost all my progress (all my 'currency' and unlocked levels) when I switched computers and I didn't play AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! for the Awesome for about 6 months. It only happened once and has been fine for a year or two now. I actually enjoyed unlocking all the levels again! I just miss the crazy hard trippy levels that were hard to get to.    The music, the fun graphics, free falling from space, whizzing back and forth avoiding flying cars and electric cables ect.... This game is the whole package of 'cool'  11/10 I love this game. I still boot it up and enjoy it immensely. I've never played a game like this.

5335	1	a	Arguably the best Cricket game ever, and I've played many. If not, it's certainly near the top.  Nice graphics, excellent gameplay, patches released on a regular basis. There is realism, depth (batting especially will take a little while to get the hang of), and room for the community to step in and create players, teams and umpires. And there is a long-awaited CAREER MODE, where you start as a 16 year old and work your way up from County/State/Province-level to International selection.  There isn't a large amount of stadia, but this is to be expected of a first release. Clearly gameplay has been the focus and DBC14 is better for it.  In my opinion, DBC14 is worthy of the 'Don Bradman' branding. Well done Big Ant on hitting this one for six.  P.S. You will need a controller, which I think is a good move, I couldn't imagine playing this on a keyboard.

Pros:  Graphics 9/10 Much Improved lately Physics 10/10 Sound 10/10 Gameplay 9/10  Cons:  No offline mode, even for single player you always have to connect to their servers. Their Servers have sometimes problems and you cannot play it till they manage to repair them.  Content prices are expensive. I bought most of the content on sales  I cannot comment on Mutiplayer as I use only Single Player but heard there are mostly fair players.

All the pros and cons have been adequetely listed by others so I'm not gonna repeat the same things again.  BA Studious have got 90% of the aspects right in their first iteration itself and that speaks volumes of the effort the team has put in. I have no doubt in my mind that in the coming years, if the franchise manages to do well it will easily overtake/threaten the big brands in the market. I can only wish that the PC platform will be supported when that happens.

4456	1	a	Very good racing sim. Playing with a logitech driving force gt and i get a very good force feedback from the car, you can really feal the track and the traction of the car. The physics are really good and the sound is just amazing. You get 3 cars and 1 or 2 tracks in various configurations for free, but the rest of the cars and tracks arent all that costly, even more when you compare it to iracing. I just got the WTCC 2013 pack, with 5 cars and 3 tracks for little more then 10euros and there are a lot of content in discount. A great bonus over other racing games where you need to buy cars is that in Raceroom you can try all the cars before you buy them, they let you get a few laps around a track to see if you like it. If you really like racing games you should try this game out, you will not regret it, besides its free to play, so just try it.

So much detail into the smaller things that matter and a fresh new way to play.   9.8 out 10 Its a master of cricket games, deserves hall of fame . Im glad to see you can play old teams and not just current ones it even brings a career mode where you star as young rising star. This game deserves every penny it asks for, i say this because if the people behind this game continue down this path there are some very exciting times down the line.

You can fully customize your kart and player sometimes resulting in hilarious and ridiculous creations. It is definetly meant to be played with friends as it is way better (AI can be as smart as a banana) and there are no active servers. Hours of pure and legit fun.

394	1	a	AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! for the Awesome in my opinion was a fun game. The basics of the game is to jump off buildings and score as much points as you can by falling as close to objects as you can and going near as many different objects as you can. They slowly add more mechanics throughout the game like tagging government buildings, giving thumbs up and fans and the middle finger to protestors, and activating a coffee mode where things slow down for a brief moment.  The original levels are enjoyable for a bit but I found myself starting to be burned out by them once they were almost all done. The game was just starting to feel stale and repetitve. Finally i grinded through the last of the original levels and started with the 'Awesome' levels. The awesome levels restored my faith and enjoyment in the game. The game was a lot faster and certain levels added a checkpoint system. The 'Awesome' levels also have a hard to follow storyline. After completing a level you will hear a broadcast message if you listen to them all the final one will be about you 'Player one' help support an uprising for supporting base jumping.  All and all I had a fun time with this game for the most part and I would reccomend it people who are on the fense about buying it.

458	0	a	Hmm hmm. What to say about this game. The negative is basically meaningless 'cause I'm just really 'meh' on this one. I don't hate it and it can be entertaining but it's not that compelling or deep and rather reptetive after a while.  The visuals are kind of bland, for one. Funny, right, unique, but still very bland. I liked Drunken Robot Pornography's aesthetic a lot, but this game is just not as interesting visually. Musically the songs are all okay I guess? I guess. There's basically no plot except for a radio announcer guy who I ignored after the fourth or so time he appeared because just kidding there's no plot. Yeah, ehh.  The gameplay itself is a more arcade-y score-attack type of thing, which is fine, but not my kind of gameplay. I'd rather the game be about completing hard levels than completing a lot of easy-to-average levels really well. Progressing in the game isn't hard but I have no drive to sink in the time it would take to 5* everything, at all. The controls tend to be decent enough though a bit sluggish-feeling, and the parachute mechanic is kind of trash, but it's all fine on a basic level. There's just too much of it with too little variety. I didn't even finish the main game levels (all the added ones though, which at least were decently interesting and more varied).  I mean yeah, if that kind if gameplay is your thing, go for it I'd say. It's not really my thing. So I can't review it positively. EHH.

You almost cannot feel the game without paying (meaning one or two free 'tracks'. All the real ones are paid for), there is no story-mode, the physic is not well done (no car damage, no aerodinamics, very limited tarmac/grass friction) and you cannot assign more than one button to the same action (meaning that I need to choose if I want paddle shifters or stick, but never both).  The game feels like a copy of ACR, and doesn't live up to his competition.  Otherwise, the menu system is very nice, once you get used to it.

3165	1	a	i found this game by watching some youtubers and i thought that it looked like a good amount of fun, however i didnt have much money so i was a bit hesitant to buy it. After a couple of months i recieved a notification that the game was free for the weekend so epople could try it out. after about 10 hours in two days i bought the game the moment the trial ended. its an absolutely great game which i have never regretted buying because it has gameplay which is always entertaning. whether you're struggling to keep up with a pro, slowing down for a noob or having an intense match with someone on par you can always have a laugh about the result. And probably one of the greatest hings about this game is the community, this game gets nowhere near the same amount of toxic players as other games, almost all of the players are friendly happy people (i honestly believe that in all of my time playing i've only come across 10 toxic players and 1 bot). as a result i could not recommend this game enough and encourage you to get it as soon a you can.  I look forward to seeing you on the race track.

5519	1	a	BB must be judged in two seperate ways: as a boardgame, and as a pc game. As a boardgame, it is an extremely interesting, very deep, beautifully balanced strategy boardgame. The variety of races, skills, and the fact that each team's playing style, potential and builds are truly unique and different, make it stand out. The only fact that may discourage or frustrate players, is that luck may make or break a game of blood bowl. The game is intentionally made so, that anything can fail quite miserably, or succeed quite unexpectedly, if one is lucky enough. To some players this is intense and exciting, to others it is maddening and rage-inducing. Avoid, if you count yourself among the latter. In general, it is one of the most interesting boardgaming experiences one may have.  As a pc game, it does have some advantages. It is pretty solid, and the multiplayer works excellently - it is relatively easy to find an opponent, and many times, even if one player loses connection momentarily, it succeeds in reconnecting. The community is usually friendly, and bad manners aren't that common. On the negative side, everything other than the online multiplayer is laughably bad. The game doesn't feature any interactive way to teach you the rules of BB - of which there are many - and you have to learn them by reading the pdf rulebook. The single player campaign's AI is horribly bad; so bad, that playing vs AI has no value whatsoever, as the computer's moves are illogical, and the team builds it uses are unorthodox and usually worthless. Blitz mode is amazingly awful and doesn't deserve looking at.  Concludingly, I would say, BUY THIS GAME. But only if you are fully aware what you're getting into: a deep, complex, multiplayer strategy boardgame with a steep learning curve. Oh, and visit  bbtactics.com , it will make starting up a lot easier. Good luck, have fun.
383	1	a	Funny and fun. I would recommend.
4322	1	a	Awesome game to play with friends, has depth, great gameplay and is tons of fun, what else to say?
4663	1	a	great racing sim. wide selection of detailed cars/classes and courses that are updated quite frequently. offciall DTM, WTCC, ADAC series, with all cars, liveries and tracks. amazing sound. FFB is great, strong, detailed and realistic. the settings are not too complicated to adjust to personal taste. people complain about it being not being free...of course it isn't, but you pay for what you are interested in, and there are always things on sale.  overall, one of my favorite sims. the devs are always improving it and adding new content.
1175	1	a	Speedrunners is a great game to play with friends, Speedrunners is a great game to play alone. No matter how you play it, speedrunners is a great game worth every penny. Don't be discouraged by the fact that it's still in early acess, because it still has a decent amount of developer maps, and a seemingly infinite stream of good player created maps. I have played for quite a while, and the only bug i have encountered out of all the games I've played, was a small item glitch, and that should say something. If you haven't already bought it, stop trying to convince yourself not to and buy it!  TLDR:  early acess? yes.  no quality content worth your money?  ABSOLUTLEY NOT

Its lack of polish, unrefined and floaty physics, and just general quality-of-life features show just how far RedLynx have come over the years. This is a very barebones game, but it was necessary for the devs to get to the point that they're at now. As it stands, this is a decently fun little time-waster, but the Miniclip sponsorship signs in the background show you exactly what kind of mindset you should approach this with.  Overall, I recommend skipping this version and picking up Trials Evolution or Fusion instead. Or, you could even play their mobile app, which is also very good.

4670	1	a	Let me start off by saying this is an incredible game. There's lots of content and the game is growing bigger step by step. I'm going to dive into some subjects a lot of negative reviews talk about and try and explain my viewpoint on them.    Multiplayer    The multiplayer is currently still developping. There are dedicated servers, and you can create your own lobbies. Multiplayer at the moment isn't very crowded, however you can have some good and fun races.    Payment model    Contrary to the Free to Play tag this game isn't free to play. A better tag would be Free Demo, but it seems this can't be helped. I'm going to compare the game with league of legends, because it's a well known free to play game. In league of legends you earn in game currency for playing, and that currency can be used to buy things. Next to the ingame currency there is a currency buyable with irl money. In RaceRoom, there is no ingame currency, just vRP, which can be bought for irl money. That's also why I don't think the Free to Play tag applies.  Now on to the paymeny model. Paying 50â¬ upfront for a game and unlocking all the content is very nice, but there will most likely be content you don't like or feel like playing. In RaceRoom, tracks, cars, trackpacks and carpacks can be bought seperately. Say you don't like DTM, but do like GT2, then you can just buy the GT2 cars. One thing to note is that if you want all the items, you'll be looking at a price quite a bit higher than 50â¬. But to put his into perspective, in league of legends you pay +- 10â¬ for a champion, in RaceRoom you pay +- 2.5 euro for a car.  I should also note that content can be tested for free, so you have an idea whether or not you like it.    Interface    The interface has been upadtes, is new easy to navigate and comprehend, but you still need a mouse to be able to quickly navigate menu's    Some personal insight   I do believe you need a wheel to play this game. You can you a gamepad, but then you're just not getting the complete experience.   The sounds in the game are incredible, especially with the new transmission sound update.  Graphics are great and the game runs on older hardware however there is only Dx9 support if I'm not mistaken.   As an ending I'd say, try the game out, test drive some cars, and if you like it buy some cars you enjoy driving.

4374	1	a	First off, this is one of the most intense games I have played. The platforming is rock solid, the grappling hooks are perferctly implemented, and the powerups aren't too overpowered. The game is well balanced, and even if you are behind, you can catch up in a flash. It's incredibly easy to pick up and go, and practice makes perfect. Even though this is still in early access, it has very few bugs, with the exception of occasional lag, which is to be expected. Easily one of the best multiplayer experiences I've had. Also, the characters are wonderfully weird, and the game doesn't take itself too seriously, which is something triple A games have a big problem with. Buy this game right now, you will not be disappointed. Plus, it's only $15, which is a steal. Start your speedrunning, grappling hooking, ice beaming, box dropping escapades today! 9.5/10.

Graphics quality from the stadium models to the actual textures are anywhere from average to extremely poor. The lack of resolution options for UHD and wide screen users is disheartening (max res is 2560x1440). The menu is cumbersome to say the least and the actual game controls end up being a chore and take away any fun that is left in the game.

Causes his hook to swing him backwards out of screen. I win the round. Disconnected from game. Friend says, 'This game is literal trash'. Uninstalls speedrunners. Go to write this review. Tell friend about it. He says, 'If you post that review i'm banning you from discord.' Good. I don't need him. Only elite speedrunners on this friends-list. Post anyway. Losing a friend has never felt so good. 10/10

386	1	a	An exhilarating (and often fatal) game that you'll probably have fun with. Even as you smash into things at less-than-safe speeds over, and over, and over again &gt;:D
5544	1	a	Blood Bowl: Chaos Edition isn't much different from the Legendary Edition, though I understand most people recommend buying Chaos Edition if you haven't purchased either. They have some extra races included.  Blood Bowl is Games Workshop's blend of American Football and Rugby, and is a faithful recreation of the tabletop boardgame. Pick a race, recruit players, and have them all killed on the field by Chaos Dwarves during your first game.  BB is arbitrary, with good strategy only able to minimize the punishing dice rolls. Embrace the chaotic nature of your plans going awry, your Catcher with Sure Hands, Nerves of Steel, and Block dying at the hands of a zombie because you rolled 3 skulls and have no team re-rolls left, and watching a Gutter Runner go nearly the length of the entire field to score.  Because if you're lucky, you'll catch that little rat on the next play and break his neck, ending his career forever.  Not for the faint of heart or those who care that the dice are brutal and don't care about you.  For: people who enjoy NFL Blitz, watching Orcs beat down hapless Wood Elves, and anyone who can handle losing because the dice didn't go your way. Lots of fun.

4411	1	a	What an incredible racing game and this is coming from someone who didn't appreciate F1.  The graphics are pretty even by 2016's standard. At first I couldn't compete in qualifying against AI which put me in the last position consistently. Then I started to learn the tracks better and I began to improve in qualifying sessions. 19th out of 24, 18th, 7th, then eventually 1st and 2nd!! The reward feeling is incredible as you win your races.  In career mode you have to also master your race strategy which means knowing which tire set to choose and when to go to pit. Temperatures of brakes and tires are simulated so if they are cold you will find yourself sliding in corners. As I started to do well in dry races, I encountered another challenge in the dynamic weather. When it gets from sunshine to rain, you need to time your pit wisely to change tire set. New tires are cold and take time to adjust to the rythm of racing so you can't just push your car mindlessly. I struggled bad when weather turns from dry to wet until I learned when to pull a pit stop and to watch out for the temperatures of both my brakes and tires.  Again, this is a beautiful F1 game that's pretty with immersive sound effects. You can feel the competitiveness from the AI. Whoever coded the AI deserves a medal!  Buy this even if you just have a slight interest in F1.  UPDATE July 13th 2016 After I bought F1 2013 which is deemed by many to be the best F1 title from Codemasters yet, I'm loving F1 2012 even more. While F1 2013 is a bit prettier than F1 2012, it suffers from water spray not being shown in replays. I often record my games and post the videos on Youtube as a personal album of sort and this water spray bug bugs me very much especially from an F1 title vaunted very much to be the best yet from Codemasters. F1 2013 AI is also much tougher and I simply cannot keep up with the AI. In races where I could get into podium in F1 2012, I must settle with 5th-6th place instead in F1 2013. Some people may like the tougher AI but not me. Thus, F1 2012 is very much the more accessible game. As for the vaunted handling of F1 2013, I found it to be an overstatement. Cars in F1 2013 may be more twitchy at slow speeds but that doesn't necessarily make them more realistic....only more difficult to control at slow speeds. High speed handling in F1 2013 is on par with F1 2012 if not slightly more arcade (easier to drive). I regret buying F1 2013 at full price in fact because of the marginal value it has over F1 2012 which I bought for very cheap. Aside from the lackluster DLCs F1 2013 has no obvious edge over F1 2012. Certainly nothing to justify buying it at full price considering Codemasters has maintained the F1 2013 at full price for 2 years without any discount whatsoever being offered.  Here's a little comparison between F1 games that I own: F1 2012: Great value, great handling physics, capable but not overwhelming AI (AI is at the sweetest spot imo), a minor bug in helmet visor texture, still looks good for 2016's standard, cars have V8 engine with awesome sound and you get to race as or with Michael Schumacher (2012 is his final racing year)  F1 2013: Bad value since it's not been discounted for couple years now, at slow speeds the cars are more twitchy while at higher speeds the cars feel a tiny bit more arcade than F1 2012, rather overwhelming AI that can shock new players, bug: AI water spray isn't being shown in replay, a bit prettier than F1 2012, cars have V8 engine with awesome sound though there's no longer Michael Schumacher in the game, DLCs allow you to race in 1980s and 1990s F1 cars although the track and team lists are lacking.  F1 2014: Good value when discounted, handling is quite a bit more arcade compared to previous iterations and suffers from understeer, good AI that's not as overwhelming as F1 2013, bug: AI water spray isn't being shown in replay, prettier than F1 2013, all teams are unlocked from the start in career mode so you don't have to start in a low tier team, has unlimited replay option that alleviates any worry of you ruining a race due to short lapses of concentration, cars have new turbocharged V6 engine with underwhelming sound...

4635	1	a	I'm going with a 'yes' to 'do you recommend this game ?', but that 'yes' needs to be qualified. If you want an easy arcade style game, as a lot of the other reviews suggest to me, then move on, this isn't a game, it's a serious simulation. Like most serious simulations, you can't expect to get everything in one download. You buy the base and then you add the elements that interest you, just like people did with scalextric or electric train sets back in the good old days :) The advantage of this offering is that the first part is free. It doesn't include a lot, but if you have some patience, there is enough to get a feel for what is on offer and decide if you want more.  I have tried both Assetto Corsa and RaceRoom Experience this past week. My first impression was that Assetto Corsa was better. It cetainly has the better interface and the option to set up the cars to some degree is attractive. RR3 has some problems with it's server and the current Nvidia drivers, but, while frustrating, these are not major issues, assuming these will be fixed in the near futures. Both simulations promise multiplayer options, although it looks like the RR3 option will be limited to the DM Experience DLC for now. For me the availability of the DM Experience tips the odds in favour of RR3 for the moment, but I'm happy to follow both for now and see what the future brings.  One final word regarding control options. I haven't tried either simulation with a mouse/keyboard option and I don't think this would be much fun. A PC xbox 360 controller is what I am using at the moment and I find it adequate for the for the 'amateur', as opposed to 'novice' level of skill.

I really like the selection of cars and tracks, and the cars in each class are very well balanced so that every car is a potential winner. They've also really nailed it with a good mix of classics and modern racing series like DTM and WTCC.  The controls, force feedback and sound is nothing less than fantastic! Beats everything else on the market hands down. Graphics are also top notch. The game has had a rough start, but now it's really starting to shine.  Laser scanned Nordschleife is also coming soon, which will make the game even more better. :)

454	1	a	Like and AaAAa 1.5, with all the old levels plus half as many new (and more awesome) ones, but it's also got fancier graphics, controller support, and the ability to transfer your data over from the original game, so if you're an AaAaa! Fan, get this, and if you haven't played the original, just skip that and get this one instead.
436	1	a	Bargain-priced title with plenty of content, a lot of excitement, and a satisfyingly high yet not-frustrating difficulty level. Buy this if you like speed and challenge in your games.

4481	1	a	I'm fairly new to PC Simulation gaming, the main reason I bought my rig was for Race Sims and so far my time has been spent mostly on RaceRoom Racing Experience. I can't quite put my finger on why.   the game feels much, much smoother than the other two i've played (Assetto Corsa and Automobilista), i'm yet to give others a go. Along with having a superior sense of speed, I believe the cars handle much closer to their real life counterparts, mainly because i've been behind the wheel of an open wheeler and it bought back a few key memories and feelings.   Annoyingly, the game is a money pit, but hey, the base game is free and i'd be more than happy to invest on just the GT series and WTCC series, but... That's not me, I need them all!!! I've had a blast in the masters and WTCC series so far. I'm really, really hoping they can pick up a WEC license at some point, then this game will literally be my go to.   The tracks seem pretty solid, Brands Hatch feels really solid, incredibly close to the real version, this is the only track I know from person so the only one I can really push. Other tracks also feel solid, Force Feedback seems to be creditable with a nice road feel and tyre lean coming through the wheel nicely.   RaceRoom seems to be the only game to give me a close race all the way through the race, others seem to have the ai drop off a little at stages. My one annoyance with RaceRoom is that I seem to blast the Qualifying 1 or 2 seconds faster than second place but then the ai stick with me through the race, even though my lap times barely drop off from qualifying. Not that i'm complaining, I love bumper to bumper action that the WTCC delivers.   But from my amature opinion, I'd chose RaceRoom over Assetto Corsa and Automobilista, but only for now, Assetto Corsa seems to be going places fast, especially now there's a console version to push the developers a bit. Automobilista is a fantastic sim too, so â¥â¥â¥â¥ing fun, i've never even heard of the developers but they've done a banging job! As soon as they get their hands on a new graphics engine, things are going to go pretty sweetly for them. I believe they got there's engine from the first version of a very popular racing sim with an insane tyre model. They're sticking with it because they know the engine so well which is fair enough, it does need updating though XD   But yeah... Add WEC with multi category racing and i'll fall in love with RaceRoom.

5473	1	a	Was a little disappointed with the need for a internet connection to play as well as requiring a Xbox Controller to play the game. As the controls ain't too complicated I've since gotten used to the controller and the graphics and realism looks good as well.   Too bad they weren't able to get actual cricketers for their commentary team though I suppose a Judo specialist and SBS soccer commentator are good enough. The customising elements of the game are great and extensive and all in all give the player the ability to play the game of cricket how, where and with who they want.   To sum it all up I would recommend this game as it is fun and to the nature of cricket there are many things that they could have improved on but Big Ant could have done a lot worse as well.

4805	1	a	I love cars and 3D racing games and this game gives a good explanation of racing with a variety of tracks and cars to choose from but there are four problems. First there is only one track you have to choose from as far as I can see and you have to pay for the rest of them and I use Aussie Dollars not USD, so that makes it even harder for me to buy the game currency. Second there are only two cars you start off with, the Aquila and the BMW. There both great I can tell you that but the Aquila has just poor steering and same goes with the BMW. Third I don't know how to earn the game currrency so that is a big problem for me. Last it said 2 hours to install and it took 7 hours and I had to wait a day for it to fully load.  I would recommend this game to car and racing fans but just look out for poor steering because the first track you use has a few hard turns and you have to really judge you turning because the turn, most of the time is hard to make and when your in first person view you see the steering wheel only turn a small amount not going in a full rotation like other games. You also have to wait a couple of seconds before the cars goes from N to D or N to R.   Overall I did enjoy the game but its just those few problems that took some of the joy out of playing the game. I would give this game a 6.5/10.

37	0	a	' A Reckless Disregard for Gravity ' is a game based on a simple concept: jump off a high point, do some sick tricks to earn points, and land on the ground safely. Despite many positive aspects, the game is marred by several technical and aesthetic choices made by the developers.    The Good:    * Unique use of humor.  * Excellent sound track and sound effects.  * The base-jumping mechanic is a new, innovate way of playing games. It is a joy to jump from your starting point and hear the rush of the wind blow across your avatar's ears.  * Flight controls are good enough to seem realistic but forgiving enough to let you make a few mistakes and have fun.   * Plenty of unique ways to score points: getting close to objects, staying close to objects, giving spectators a thumbs-up or an obscene gesture, and spraypainting graffiti were all things I found within my first hour or two of play.    The Bad:    * For the world's first base-jumping game, the game feels remarkably NOT like base-jumping. Rather than zooming along the side of tall skyscrapers and landing on the ground, the player instead navigates an obstacle course of abstract, floating blocks that stand to 'represent' buildings and lands on a final circular block that is meant to represent the ground. If the player overshoots 'the ground,' he continues to fall. Yes, you can actually miss the ground. Interestingly, the levels that feature base-jumping off a mountain feature a well-modeled and detailed mountain that actually resembles something like a real mountain. (If you are going to use aestheticized shapes to represent real-world objects, why not do it consistently?)  * Every aspect of the game, from the UI to the action portion, looks and feels like a first-generation iPhone game. From the big, finger-friendly buttons conveniently placed on opposite corners of the screen, to the simplistic level design, to the generic graphics.  * The simple level design gives the game a very low difficulty level. I understand the point of the game is to score points and not just to reach the bottom of the map, but I wish there were a few more levels where it would be a challenge to reach the landing pad.  * Although there are several dozen levels (80), the variety of them is lacking. Each level is essentially the same as the last; none of them seem more or less fun than any others.  * No backgrounds in any level. Every level has a simple color gradient for a background. How about at least a simple sky wallpaper?    The Ugly:    * The game has a horrible name. There is no way I am going to talk to my friends and be able to mention this game by name, which hurts word-of-mouth recommendations. It's as if the developers  chose this name because they wanted to come first alphabetically, and then later released '1...2...3... Kick It' when they realized that numbers precede letters in Steam's alphabetizing system.    Verdict:    Watch a few videos of the game online. Wou will have more fun watching other people play the game than doing it yourself.

470	1	a	This game is really great with the oculus rift dk2 and surprisingly a whole lot easier to control as opposed to playing it without VR. The problem is that it hasn't been updated to work with the latest rift runtime yet. I fortunately have a secondary computer with win7 and have runtime 0.6 on it but not everyone who has a dk2 will have that option.  I'm giving this a thumbs up and I recommend only if you have a DK2 with runtime 0.6 or if the developers update to run on 0.7+ If you don't have a vr set I recommend this when it's on sale. It's a descent game that will keep you entertained if played for a few minutes a session.

4552	1	a	Reason's to get this game.  1: It's a Simulator. Meaning real life-like driving, if on Get Real difficulty. Other difficulties are fun to play as well, depending on your driving skill.  2. The ability of being able to buy games with-in the simulator that allow you to experience even more real life-like driving content.  3. If you are not fortunate to buy the games with-in the simulator, then this game come with 3 free cars with skin packs plus 3 tracks with different routes.  4. Again, if not fortunate to pay for the games you also can race for content, do well and you along with 10 possible others can win content.  5. Regardless of any content you may or may not of bought, there is always players out there that you can challenge yourself against. A community to find drivers and challenge there records or them yourselves in multiplayer, you choose.  6. This game takes skill to play and if you like to test your skill without the 'DEATH' chance, then the creators went a step farther and allow you to buy for your home reality chambers. Fully customizable driving frames that allow you to take control behind a steering wheel having the feel of a real life like racing experience.  7. The initial simulator is 'FREE'  8. Much more inside.....

There can be some annoying bugs but they arenbt game breaking. Once you get down to gameplay its actually good fun and it makes for a nice little pick up and play football experience. I find though that playing for a long time can become boring and very repetetive. Graphics are 2D but its style is good very similar to old skool Title Sensible Soccer. Overall i would reccomend to those that dont want a serious football sim and are just after that classic arcade feel sports gem.

5246	0	a	  I would not suggest this game to anyone, I love racing games, both simulation and arcade but this one, it's just too bad it decided to be a free2play game instead of a real game. It doesn't have many cars and tracks for a game that is supposed to be updated often. You have to pay for the stuff and it's overpriced, give me a all in one pack that will also contains all future content for a fair price then that would be good but unfortunately, it is not the case, you can see that the developer is just one other among the incompetents and greedy sheep of the modern gaming industry. As I can understand, if you buy one car, you can only choose one livery but I am unsure about that so do not totally trust me about this one. It is probably one of the only racing game that has DTM, the only one that I am aware of but when it comes to WTCC you're better off with RACE - The WTCC Game and GTR for GT. I'll be honest, the difficulty is pretty though, pretty much harder than every single rally games I have played (almost all of them), harder than F1 games and harder than pretty much everything, maybe that I am not used to this kind of racing (DTM), I'd love to but I hate how their game works, sell the game then that's it, no microtransactions, no in-store content or at least, make us able to buy a bundle that has everything in it and that would also contain everything in the future and no crap such as what Ubisoft did - selling a season pass then selling an 'expansion' that you have to buy even if you own the season pass. Other than that, the graphics are great but the worse point of this game is that it has no offline mode.    In short.  Negative:  1. No offline mode. 2. Overpriced content. 3. No bundle that has everying in it for a fair price. 4. Does not have a lot of content for a game that is supposed to be updated often.   Positive:  1. Great difficulty. 2. Great maneuverability/gameplay. 3. Great graphics (even If honestly, I do not care too much about the graphics as long as it is all the same everywhere unlike some games in particular).  Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this game because of its big flaws.  4/10

I have a lot more good time with RRRE than I expected! The big con however is the content princing ... but the content quality is really the highest I found as game DLC.  As comparison I play Assetto Corsa, Dirt Rally (and sometimes Project Cars...).

It looks like it should be scary/sickening, but it isn't, it just thrilling. The developers have done a great job with the VR port - it is one of the best available at the moment.

128	1	a	I know this Dejobaan game came before Drunken Robot Pornography, but I played DRP first, and amazingly, that game was actually easy compared to this one. Despite the fact that this game is frustrating as hell, it is still amazing. Graphically, right from the first spit second of the menu screen, this game is a thrill to play. Unlike DRP, this game says exactly what it entails, and that is the sound you'd be making if you were the protagonist in this game. You jump off a building, you scale buildings for points, you meet score quotas to earn stars which, in turn, earn you teeth which you use to unlock new levels. Again, like DRP, Dejobaan proves that you don't have to be complicated to be an amazing game. Just pair stunning visuals with great music and COUNTLESS levels. I've been playing this for a hours and i still haven't unlocked them all. And for a game where all you do is fall, that's pretty damn good.

A good game to waste your time on when your bored or are looking for a challenge. If you have a fear of heights it will be ok since you never really hit the ground! XD

338	1	a	This is one of those games that is so funny/quirky that it's impossible to write a funny/quirky recommendation. Really all I can do is quote the game's intro:   'In the year of our Lord, nineteen eighty two, polystructures fell from space. Massive but light, they touched the atmosphere, and stuck.  Scientists made new materials. Builders made new cities. Families made their homes thousands of feet above ground level. Art made the floating super-sculptures, and culture made the floating caviar socials to regard them.  In the year of our Lord, twenty eleven, you cannot look up from beneath a city and see the stars.  But you can look down from above it. And you can jump.  The jumps you make are not about art. They are about a reckless disregard for safety.  The jumps you make are not about culture. They are about a reckless disregard for regulation.  The jumps you make are not about science. They are about a reckless disregard for gravity.'  And that's the least nutty part of the game.

The bugs are so bad you can't even play it. So... â¥â¥â¥â¥ing... bad... This is the first bad review I've done and I will change if the dev's fix it. Have posted on forums, with other people joining in having similar, stupid â¥â¥â¥ issues. At first the devs made a joke about it, then they said they're working on it... a month and a half later nothing. Crap developers making crappy games that shouldn't be on steam. Anyone who posts a positive review of this game is a complete â¥â¥â¥â¥ing moron.   http://steamcommunity.com/app/15560/discussions/0/616189106706421199/   And the link they removed is to the steam discussion I had with the problems that they can't or refuse to fix. Ya... real professinal. Anything that doesn't look good for them, censor all they can. Look up mouse sensitivity and input issues in the forums. Don't let them hide behind lies. Oh and all the comments on this, and people rating negative reviews as unhelpful, it's all the company's cronies doing it. Scam upon scandal. Be wary

400	1	a	The ultimate anti-platformer. BASE jump through floating futuristic cities and try not to splat against anything on the way down!  The idea with this game is not to play it for long periods of time. Five to ten minutes is generally all you need to feel satisfied with it for quite some time. Once that happens, put the game away for a while. Play it too long, and you start driving it into the ground (pun intended).  'AaaaaAAaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!!' is great as a hot-seat game, too. You'll love it.

5378	1	a	This is the best cricket game ever developed.  When i first played it, the experience just swept me off my feet. I was thinking if its really possible to develop a game with so much realism.  Batting seems as if we're really doing it. In order to score runs, you've got to apply yourself. Also one could play all the possible shots in the cricketing notebook.  Edges are very realistic which was never done before in any game.  Fast bowling is a real charm with all the subtle variations possible. Although spin bowling bores me personally, its also good with all real variations.  Overall, Its an excellent game which must not be missed.

Blood Bowl: Chaos Edition takes American Football, throws the rulebook out the window and adds in the Warhammer universe. All while your fate is decided with the roll of the dice..  This is like the ultimate luck simulator. Sometimes â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t plays work... sometimes they don't and you have the worst match in your life.  This is a good game to play with friends or in a small community. Public leagues are ok, but I feel you can have more fun with the first.  I throughly recommend this game. 8/10 Gabemas GabeN

4458	0	a	The graphics are great, the physics feel authentic and there's no question that a lot of work went into making this a high-quality racing sim. The business model is sketchy (at best) and resembles EA over the last few years--- free games are probably around to stay, but excessive microtransactions don't have to come with them. I'd gladly pay $20 for unlimited access to all of the content in the game--- or $40 if it included community-creation tools. Just my two cents: proceed with extreme caution.

239	1	a	This Game is absolutly amazing, it totally understands what it is trying to do and does it perfectly. The only question is do you understand what it is trying to do?  If you are wondering to yourself 'wait in these clips it seems like you could just go on the outside of these courses' the anwser is yes, yes you can. And have absolutly nothing in your way so you can master the movement without getting frustrated. Getting frustrated? THE GAME HAS A SOLUTION TO IT!!!!! It will go through breathing exersices with you to calm you down. This game does not take itself seriously it knows from moment 1 that it is made for fun and the challenge is there if you want it, but only if you want it.   This game has a huge varitety making me reccomend it to casual gamers and Hardcore gamers because you can progress from level to level fairly easily for casual but if you want to 5-Star every level it will give you a good challenge.  Getting the movement down to a useable level is really easilly but mastering it is really hard.   I absolutly love this game from start to just leaving it in your library for every-once-in-awhile play.

However, since this is a  MULTIPLAYER ONLY GAME , only in a blue corn moon will you find somebody else to play with. I cannot recommend a dead game, no matter how good or fun it was.  They eventually added sorta-singleplayer, but it's just not the same as the other games in the series. Instead look for Blood Bowl or something else similar. This game just isn't worth your time or money.   DO NOT BUY THIS!

4497	1	a	Looks like a worthy successor to RACE 07 series. Still needs a bit of polish especially in the multiplayer department, but is a lot of fun as it is right now. After a few tweaks the physics/FFB system feels quite natural. The devs keep working on improving the game and it's visible. Competitions are one of my favourite modes. They are a great way to improve multiplayer experience, as it's a nice incentive for drivers to improve track knowledge and setups by competing with others.
5458	1	a	This game is truly special if you're a cricket fan! its not perfect but considering the budget it was on it is really good, if you dont know much about cricket and you want to learn the rules this game is for you aswell! I highly reccomend this game for anybody with an interest in cricket!

Basically, the game simulates you falling off a building, and you have to make it to your target without hitting other parts of the building. To be honest, I found the game quite offensive due to the nature of falling out of buildings. I felt really scared once I jumped off and I thought it was real for a second.   I don't recommend this game if you have vertigo, which I have.   I rate it 9 out of 11.

I like the idea of improving your own player and options to do outside the match because it gives me this RPG vibe.  If you're not in a hurry to buy this game its okay to slip it until it goes on sale but yeah, this is surprisingly a fun &amp; addicting game to me.
39	0	a	Very quicly loses its appeal. Nothing stands out in terms of gameplay, sound, graphics or replayability. Gameplay is even fickle at times, it's tough to say what will cause you to lose the level or what you will 'bounce' off of. Played for as long as I did to try and unlock all the levels, but I had a really hard time trying to force myself to play. Not willing to go back to previous levels to get more in-game currency to unlock variations of the same mechanics copy and pasted across a wall of cubes. Not even sure if the game is 'beatable', I'll be placing this title in the 'abandonware' category of my library.

5509	0	a	TL;DR â Great cricket game, poor 2014-15 sports sim title, especially when considering the price.  This is without doubt the best cricket game ever made. I have played all the EA and many Codemasters offerings from the 90s through to '11 when the last Codemasters game came out.  However, baring that in mind I cannot recommend this game. This is based on a variety of factors and especially the price. This game, as far as I am aware, has never been on sale and has stayed at Â£35 or $50. For that amount of money you can buy far superior sports titles that are less likely to crash, do not require an internet connection whenever you launch it and look and play better. This game has complicated controls, that aren't easy to pick up because the tutorials (last time I played) haven't been updated. The sound is just terrible, between dull and repetitive commentary (although those that like cricket might say that it is quite spot on) and poor on the field sounds I usually turn the volume off and listen to a podcast.  Furthermore, the game crashes way too much. In the past two weeks there have been a rush of patches after 6 months of silence. They made some nice changes but the whole game has been too unstable. This is especially the case considering I am not on any kind of beta channel and there is no option to only get major patches rather than the smaller ones the studio has been putting out.  The biggest issue, however, is that (based on my last playthrough) the game is NOT an accurate simulation. Between bowlers consistently bowling down leg and batsmen playing at nothing down off this is not cricket. Because it fails at its main task it is difficult to recommend the game. When including the other issues and price it is impossible, in my opinion, to give this game a passing grade.

250	1	a	 I THREW...MYSELF...ON THE GROOOOUUUND !!!   This game is extremely fun, not much to say...you jump off stuff and fall trying to avoid stuff that will break you like the little insect that you are, while trying to stay close to said stuff...yeah...if base jumping/gliding feels stupidly dangerous to you IRL, you'll love this game because you can have a small fraction of that and the ability to do it again if you fall to your worthless death...pu*sy.  The music is great, the humor is good, I can't see why you wouldn't have fun with this title.  Play this game with a controller, or joystick.  I can only imagine how this game would feel on Occulus Rift...or even with a nice setup consisting of a good monitor/tv and a pro sound system :)

72	1	a	Personal Rating: 6/10 Genre: Daredevil Stunt Arcade Score Attack Plays like: Pilotwings (Skydive levels), very few games like it.  Very unique game about..well falling from great heights. Every level begins with the character jumping off a skyscraper and falling at high speed. You must hit score blocks and perform simple stunts to increase your score. Playing dangerously will reward you more points which is the main goal of the game. Nailing a perfect rating on each course will take many many hours. If you're looking for a very different type of game and love achieving high scores, this is the game for you.

4577	1	a	Alot of reviews from people that won't give this game much time - Granted, I spent a good while getting the graphics and feeling (FFB etc) right but you will love it once you find that sweet spot. I find the physics of every car much more alive and engaging than similar vehicles on say, Project Cars or Assetto Corsa, with the force feedback (Using a G27) and the sounds being top notch. Easily the best of any racing sim IMO.  The mix of content is fantastic and the track list is a brilliant! - A load of tracks you actually want to drive, not a load of soul-less modern build tracks. Not many games can boast the opportunity to jump from a mental super tuned Zakspeed Capri, to a 2014 WTCC Lada, to a BMW Z4 GT3 then in to a 1992 Audi Quattro DTM. And then choose to take each either up a hillclimb, round Bathurst or to Indianapolis!  And the graphics, once dialled up are great. I run a GTX970 and that runs everything maxed. Yet while you can see its a game, everything looks very real.  The whole, 'free to play, but each thing costs extra, so you end up spending a tone if you get in to it', idea sucks. But with the prices being no so bad, it could be worst. I could be in to iRacing.  Give it a try. Buy some decent content and let the game develop over time as you get in to it and you will love it. The Sector3 forum is a great place to check up on what to expect in future releases aswell and what the team are working on - plus, if you don't like something, post it on there and they will have a look and you never know, they could sort it more to your liking.
4567	1	a	its a full on racing sim not just some arcade game. download if you enjoy sim racing games. in my opinion it would play best with a wheel 
5425	1	a	As a cricket fan I have played the game for real, seen it at the top grounds in my home country, and bought various incarnations of it on the numerous consoles I have owned. When I saw this game, while browsing through the game store, my interest was peaked. I had been looking for a worthy successor to 'Brian Lara Cricket' - a great game in it's own right - and this seemed to fit the bill. I was a little hesitant about the cost, but after reading the reviews I took the plunge.  I have rarely enjoyed my first couple of hours playing a game as much as I did this one. Graphically - brilliant! Atmospherically - it's like being there. The controls are instinctive, and the ball moves dynamically depending on how the bat connects with it - as it should. I still haven't mastered the field settings but the day, as they say, is yet young. Another aspect that surprised me was the depth of history that the team choices can offer. We all have our sporting heroes and to be able to pick a team with them in it is great - even from some time ago.  All-in-all, I would highly recommend this game to all cricket fans. It is so good you can almost smell the grass. Play!

4816	1	a	RaceRoom is an excellent racing sim, one of the best actually. It has amazing graphics, physics and sounds. It runs smooth but there's one flaw and it's somewhat big. The real downside of this game is it's purchasing system and expandability. Remember, this game is free, but in reality, it's not. There is a plethora of cars and tracks, however, you only get a very small handful of each as Free to play. And I mean pretty small where I'd be dying to try the cars and tracks that you would need to buy each one separately, which to me is a gimmick.  Overall, RaceRoom is a great game and all, it's just that the developers had incorporated a very â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ expansion system. In my sense, I would've rather paid for the game to get all of the features in place of it being free.

5534	1	a	4.5 Stars - A turn based american football style game adapted from the Warhammer Universe  I had never played the board game but was instantly impressed by this game. The turn based games can punish errors quickly but the game is won when willingness to take risks and luck come together. This is all backed up with player experience, team cash management and the risk of injury or death to any participants.  The many teams can offer different plays styles from ball handling finesse to simply bashing the enemies heads in. Game play is dice controlled and nuffle can be dangerous.  Overall I enjoyed slugging away at the matches and experiementing with different team builds. I made my own strategies and really enjoyed getting my skills mix right to back this.  Pros - Turn based tactival games Team Development  Cons -  Punishes Error Matchmaking delay time

The jungle stadium looks more detailed than the old ones, and the new teams are a nice addition and fun to play. But unfortunately its only a single new arena and the teams are not well ballanced. Especially the Khorne demons are totally op. Also the full price is way to high for this.  If your a fan of Blood Bowl and get a budget price, i can recommend Chaos Edition.

4150	1	a	SpeedRunners is a fun side-scrolling game that makes me think that Indie developers could do a lot better. (No hate pls.) Cons- -No one currently plays on the multiplayer -The only DLC is youtuber DLC Pros -Works for bad computers on medium settings -The fact that this game has no flaws except for the DLC.
4534	1	a	Picked this up since it was free, figured I'd give it a try. First night playing, it was ok. The graphics are good. The physics seem good while providing a challenging driving experience. Although it did take me another day to get my FFB sorted. There really is no explanation for what some of the settings do. (or a short rather canned one)  Once I got my FFB dialed in, the game/sim really started to shine. I use the Logitech G27 with pedals and H-shifter. A wheel really is the preferred way to get the best experience, though I'm sure there are a handful of controller users out there who can rip it up pretty good.  The sounds really are pretty amazing. Especially when you start to drive different cars. Considering I've got 12 hours and 128 laps under my belt in one weekend, its safe to say I'm hooked.   If the devs can continue in the right direction with development, R3E has a lot of potential to be great! And don't be turned off by paid content until you at least try the free stuff. Other racing sim organizations (not mentioning any names) do the same thing.  =====Update 02/13/2015======  After 1100+ laps and over 2 days of total in game time I can say I'm still hooked. The most recent update Feb 2015 improved the AI and optimized the graphics. Dedicated servers are coming soon. I believe this year which will open up online racing leagues.  I own almost all the cars. All tracks and all packs but the hill climb. Yes a little pricey, but worth it IMO. The devs stay in constant contact with the community which is more than I can say for other games/sims. New tracks and cars are still in the works, the most recent upcoming new track, Sonoma and the Cadillac CTS VR coupe to be released soon as paid content. R3E has only gotten better since I've been playing it and it was pretty good when I started with it anyway.   R3E is definitely to be taken seriously among other race sims currently on the market.

4533	1	a	I tell you what... Driving a car in this game is absolutely amazing. Great FFB, car movements are so realistic, sounds are awesome, graphic is absolutely good and a weaker PC can handle it perfectly. But!!!!! Driver and steering wheel animations are not really good, but of course you can turn off these. About the content... Free content is terrible, so if you want to ENJOY the game you have to pay a lot(in cases). Typical P2E (pay to enjoy) game, which destroys the soul inside me... And THIS is, where developers made a terrible mistake. Would be better if we should pay...let's say 40-50 euros for the game and then all further content will be available. I bet, much more players would play this really-really good game. One of the best sim I've tried!! If you have the money (I have it, but this paying system f***s my brain to hell) this game is one of the best choiche. 6/10 because of the money suc*er dev team :(

4445	1	a	RaceRoom is an excellent sim racer made by the same people behind Simbin, makers of Race 07 and other great sims. It's worthy of serious consideration by everyone who loves sim racing. Don't be fooled by the many bad reviews, there's a good reason for them, which I'll explain later. There's also more good news later.   https://youtu.be/itBXrA2QEEM   http://youtu.be/I7URfx-CpwE  Raceroom offers a large collection of cars (75 in total) and tracks (25 in total, many of which have several different layouts) and 3 competitions (2 DTM and ADAC) which are called 'Experiences'. These Experiences give you full seasons with teams and drivers. In short, there's a lot of variety in this game.  I haven't put many hours into this game yet, but so far I've found the racing 'experience' to be extremely good. Physics are very realistic and the AI seems pretty good too. One very nice feature is the ARI (Adapative Racing Intelligence) which adjusts the difficulty level automatically to match your skill and experience. At first I wasn't impressed with this since the AI drivers were driving too slowly, but apparently the difficulty level starts low and increases over time. After a few races the AI had adapted to my level and started to provide some decent competition without being overly difficult to beat.  There are three racing modes; Novice, Amateur and Get Real. Novice is a bit of a joke since it actually brakes for you as you approach the corners. Amateur has realistic physics, but with traction control, ABS and zero damage. Get Real turns the driving aids off (but damage is still optional). It's a pity I couldn't configure all these things separately, I'd like to have driven on Amateur level but with damage turned on for example.  Now the bad news...  Many people have criticised this game for being free to play but with very little content. That's true, but what do you expect for free? You get 5 different cars and 3 tracks (each with several variations), more than enough to evaluate the quality of the game and give you some great racing fun for no more than the price of the download.  Think of it this way, the 'free to play' game is just a demo, the REAL game is in the addon packs. Three of the DLCs currently available on Steam are 'Experiences' - full seasons with tracks and cars - DTM 2013 and 2014, ADAC 2014. It actually makes more sense to buy these as DLCs rather than buying a whole new game every year, as with the F1 games. The fourth DLC is just a car pack, not an 'Experience'.  Here's where the problems begin...  The three Experience DLCs contain a lot of duplicate content. They mostly use the same tracks and some of the same cars. For example, the two DTM packs only have 1 track and 1 car different. This makes buying all the DLCs a waste of money, because you're paying for mostly the same content that you've already bought.  To confuse matters even more, there are many more packs you can buy that aren't available as Steam DLCs, as well as individual cars and tracks, some of which are not available in any packs. You can buy them in-game or from their website. These are bought using the in-game currency of vRP points, so you can't see what they cost in real money. However, if you add the items to your cart you can see the cost.  I created a spreadsheet to show what's available in each pack, which you may find helpful;   http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=445609150  Whoever came up with this ridiculous marketing/sales model should be fired. It confuses buyers and can result in wasted money buying duplicate content. Judging by the number of negative reviews, this has backfired on them, which is a pity. I hope they don't go bankrupt again because of this!  Fortunately, there is some good news...  While experimenting with adding various packs to the cart on their website, I discovered that they DON'T CHARGE FOR DUPLICATE CONTENT! They know what cars and tracks you own, so you don't pay extra for what you already have. So if you already own DTM 2013, DTM 2014 will be cheaper as a result. I wanted to buy all the tracks but was loathe to buy the European Track Pack for just one extra track, but when I added it to my cart, it cost less than a pound extra, less than half the price of buying that track individually!  So, it's okay to buy ONE Experience pack from Steam, but if you want any more, buy them from their site instead. Also, don't worry about duplicate content, you won't be charged for it.  Even more good news, the more packs you buy at one time, the cheaper they get. There's a cumulative discount, so if you're going to buy any packs, buy as many as you can afford to save more money. I bought 7 items and got a 16% discount. If you buy all the packs I think you get a discount of around 30%  To give you an idea of cost, I spent less than Â£30 to get all the tracks and about a third of the cars. I could have gotten all of the tracks cheaper than that, but I wanted some extra cars as well. Two tracks are not contained in any pack. Buying all the packs would cost around Â£70 I think, but unless you're a collector who has to have everything, it doesn't need to cost that much.  CONCLUSION: I highly recommend this game to all sim racers. Those who prefer casual or arcade racing should probably avoid this game (but by all means try the 'demo' first). The DLCs, packs and points method of selling this game is overly complex and confusing, but if you like this game, don't be put off by that, it's well worth the hassle, and it's much cheaper to buy the extras direct from the game or their website, NOT FROM STEAM!

4505	1	a	For racing enthusiasts or performance car fans this is a definite add to the 'garage'. The sound effects are first class as mentioned in many reviews. Definitely music to the ears and makes the adrenaline pump, simply outstanding. Having completed my racing license and tracking several sports/race cars over the years, I find the physics very good. Professional high calibre racers would be better suited to comment on the precision of the various cars.   It would be great to have a career mode introduced to add to the immersion, this would bring me back to the track more often.  The negative reviews with thumbs down due to pay to play model are both unfair and unrealistic. RacRroom make it possible to drive a couple cars and tracks free to sample the game, same as a demo of many other games/sims. Then if you like it, help keep the franchise going by purchasing some cars, tracks or both. If you don't enjoy it, nothing invested. For five or six bucks you can have a couple cars and learn to drive them properly. To truly learn a car and track takes a fair amout of seat time, so there is no need to drop a whole bunch of money right off the bat anyway, then, add as you go.  Having only sampled the online competions they seemed ok. This is not what I'm after personally so really have no valid input regarding online human v human competition.  In summary, this an excellent and fun sim; for a performance car or racing enthusiast you can't go wrong with RaceRoom.

4407	1	a	A good game but the penalty sistem is really annoying! It gives penaltys to the player for minor incidents and other cars are forgiven for bumping you hard. And the pit exit of some tracks is bugged because the game gives a penalty for crossing the pit-lane line, when the car is still controlled by the AI. I have to save rewinds for that moment for not, my race is going down hard. These kind of issues are gamebreaking, at least for me, but overall i recommend the game for the fans of F1 (if they can pass over little flaws)!!!
5193	0	a	The free version of the game has only 2 or 3 cars and only 2 tracks and I had to download 10GB for that! The game is very nice but you have to pay to have more cars and tracks.

32	1	a	 Motion sickness, the game.   The title of the game is accurate. There's not a whole lot to say here - it's a well designed, simple concept that's extremely fun. I don't see myself playing this to the point of obsession, but I will definitely play until I unlock everything and see what else I can do with it.   For those of you who are like me, and entirely too afraid to actually participate in extreme sports like base jumping, this will confirm your belief that you're really not cut out for it. You will be perfectly satisfied to sit in your chair, breathe in through your nose, out through your mouth, and imagine yourself floating to the ceiling.   A fun little game that doesn't take itself too seriously, and has enough silly humor to make you smile - note that you won't laugh uproariously, but I don't believe that was the point of this, anyway.   Gameplay is top notch, soundtrack is fun and funny, and I will definitely enjoy any time period in which I play this game, but I seriously doubt I will get addicted to it. One of those rare gems that's worth anyone's time, even iff you just have a few minutes to kill. I, personally, enjoy games that don't require a huge time investment in order to understand what they're about and have fun with them, and this is definitely the type where your boredom will die for a bit.   Plus, after you play for an hour or so you'll exit and still feel like you're playing it.   Neat. 8/10.  (Small edit: I mean it's not very addictive. I meant to say that it was fun, but I don't see myself getting addicted to it. Fixed.)

You can not unlock any content for free. -you have to buy every single piece of content...  -no multiplayer yet  Comment: Purchaching all tracks will cost you about 40eur and all cars will cost you about 15eur, at this given time. Graphics are not impressive, but they are still decent.  If you want to try out all the cars and tracks, this game will not exacly be a fair deal. In that case you are probably better of with another simulation racing game.

5345	1	a	Wow, finally a cricket game worth playing!!!  A couple of days in and I've created a couple of players and am enjoying taking them through their first season.   In my first match I spent 30 overs fielding at deep backward square leg and took a screamer of a catch before I worked out there is a menu option to simulate to your players next involvement either with the bat or the ball.  The leg spinning all-rounder is challenging having bowled a few overs to reset myself and concentrate on batting as the next task although the bowling mechanics are fun and challenging at the same time. The specialist batsman is great to play a few shots with, but I am struggling to keep my concentration, particularly if I've managed to get onto a couple of early boundaries (the same issue I had in real life)!  My highlights after approx 15 hours? Taking a 5 wicket haul for SA against Tassie and the 50 I scored for Derbyshire with my young opener off 13 balls!  The only gripes I have with the game are the commentary being inserted at random as about 1/2 the time it doesnt make sense (so I've taken to playing music at the same time) and the grounds...I've had an English County game and SA v Tas at the MCG! These are small issues though when compared to the important part of a cricket game...do the mechanics feel engaging, fluid and as though you are controlling your player...in short, yes!  This game is fun to play and being a cricket game has enough stats to keep a cricket fan entertained. Do I like my batting average being just under 30? No; will I keep playing to improve it? Yes!  That is what this genre has been missing since Shane Warne/Brian Lara's cricket in the late 90s...a game worth playing!

As soon as I got started driving the steering SUCKED. So then finally I looked for other cars and I saw only a few free cars and they all have terrible steering.

46	1	a	This game is pretty quirky. It's unique and certainly very challenging but, for me at least, it wasn't interesting enough for me to want to finish the game. The challenge on most levels is just about memorising the layout and finding the path with the highest score. There are plenty of levels though.
447	1	a	Really fun game. I payed like a dollar when it was on a Humble Bundle and this games music is so cool. Everybody should have this in their library. The game is fun and alittle pricey but still well worth it.
21	1	a	AaAaAA!!! is a strange and unusual game. The premise being simple, score points by being wreckles while you base jump from floating structures. The gameplay is simple enough, control your decent, gain as many points as possible by 'hugging' and 'kissing' strucutres, hitting scoreplates and flipping off protesters.  Part of AaAaAA!!!'s charm is that it's completely tongue-in-cheek as far as 'the man' goes. It's a strange game that no one else has really managed to pull off with a correct mix of apathy for political agendas.  Even the title theme gives a good hint as to the attitude of the game. While it may be oler, it's still a great experience to hop on every once in awhile and stands out as a shining unique experience.
242	1	a	I've booked quite a few hours playing this game over the last year. Great Game where you fall from the top of a building weaving between buildings, kissing and hugging them. you even get to flip people off to score points...lol. Tons of levels and replayability. Graphics are simple but work fine for the game and while I do not have own one it supports Occulus Rift....seriously sweet.  Dejobaan Games is my favorite Indy developer.

468	0	a	An incredibly cool experience...for the first ten minutes. I loved how original the whole concept was. However, the appeal was quickly lost. I think the biggest drawback for me was that the whole graphics scheme was SO COOL but I think its just a bit outdated.   The menus were another let down. I would have enjoyed something slightly more linear or maybe just something a bit more organized. That coupled with a bit of repetition was enough for me to lose interest.   I personally wouldnt recommend it.
4614	1	a	Great game.   I've played Forza, GT...love GT6, but damn! Raceroom is fun. I bought the WTCC addon (but I love WTCC) and it's a blast to drive. The FWD physics is awesome...awesome = realistic durining corning and hard braking. Then I bought the GT3 addon (everything was bought during Xmas sales) and it was a blast, I still need traction control but perfection comes with time (plus i'm using the xbox controller). Buying some of the tracks is a bit lame, to be honest but that's how this developer pays their employees.   I use a 8 core AMD , 32 gbs o' ram with 2 gtx 760's...more than enough for this game. It runs AMAZING.   If you love racing give this a shot and get the some of the addons while their still on xmas discount.
5576	1	a	Such blood, much bowling. Would play again, tenouttaten.

4820	1	a	Having spent some time around the various racing sims, I can say this is not the most realistic, not the best looking and not the best feeling (Force Feedback) sim out there. But currently it's my favourite,  The game is free, but you have to pay for content like cars and tracks. Considering that you probably will have a few favorite rides and some favourite places to race, you don't need to buy everyting, and with that in mind the pricing is reasonable (just buy a points package and get the content you are interested in). To get everything you have to spend a significant amount of cash, but it's still cheaper than playing iRacing or something like Project CARS / Assetto Corsa with all DLC considering the amoutn of content that is available.  Now for the game itself. The graphics are good, though not mind blowing, but considering that you will be focused on turning that wheel and operating the pedals, you will forget about visuals fast. The sound on the other hand is the best in the market hands down.   Handling is fairly realistic, though not hardcore difficult like rFactor 2, with good Force Feedback once configured properly. Though it is possible to enhoy the game with a controller, a wheel is highly recommended.  Now for the sweet parts - contrary to other sims, there is a good combination of cars and tracks. You will not see stuff like 1 car per class or useless roadcars that go slow and spin out all the time - no Ferraris and SLS AMGs, no drifting. This is all about racing. And racing is good. The AI is one of the better ones, so you will not get divebombed by crazy maniacs all the time, and the difficulty setting will accomodate players of all skill levels. Not the best AI in the market, but quite good and most of all fun,  The bad stuff? No night racing or rain. Not really a big deal, since in other sims these types of races a cool to look at, but mostly hard and frustrating. Perhaps the biggest issue to me is the lack of a dynamic racing line, where the track rubbers up in places where cars drive and you have more grip there. Not really a problem, but once you try something like this in rFactor 2, you do notice it other games. Raceroom also lacks open-wheelers and does not have many classic cars, but that is to change soon. Another thing is a full flag rules system is still to be addes at some point.  All in all, of all the new generation of racing sims, Raceroon seems most fun thanks to a good selection of cars and tracks and good AI. If you are looking to get into simracing this is defo the game to try. Other sims might have better graphics or laser scanned tracks, but not the AI Racerrom has nor the amount of actual racing content we see here.

5308	1	a	I have loads of fun playing this game and while it has some huge flaws the main core of the game is good. The bad consists in silly puzzles, loosing 'fame' even if you had 5 assists in a match and you can only get a girlfriend if you have a certain amount of money. Training also seems a bit off in terms of difficulty, some too easy and others too hard. Prices on players are also non comprehensible.  However I did buy this game to play the core of the game and see my youngster rise to the stars, that I have done. He is now at Swansea, has won the world cup for Denmark and is world wide known, everyone wants him but his pricetag is lower than the average premier league footballer, much lower. That did not stop me from buying a joypad and enjoying playing a lot, you control a single player on the pitch and after a few trials I got the hang of it, its fun to score and assist while the coach never seems happy insulting you on every turn.  In the rise of ranks I started at the Conference North with Histon... then proceeded to Dag&amp;Red, Exeter and then Swansea. I am mainly enjoying playing the matchesand looking at the statistics, something which also has kept me playing. I can look at my history and check a lot of stuff which I have done in the past.  The rest of the game is mediocre at best, some of the stuff seems made for 6 year old kids hence many bad reviews. The price should be a bit lower, around the 5 euro mark, as it is now its a bit too expensive but I would still recommend just for the core play. You can always wait till it comes on sale however.

4677	1	a	First of all I'm a big racing sim nut, I dont go for those other titles like need for speed, get a console if you like those games. Over all I like this game, its very easy to pick up, very good graphics and physics, and enjoyable, I only have the DTM add on so far and am enjoying it greatly, I've tried playing with both gamepad and steering wheel and the enjoyment is there for both. what I dont like is the amount of DLC's you end up paying for, I really wish the games industry would migrate away from this, unfortunately this game is by far the worst I have in my steam account for this, and the main reason I havent bought more packs. overall yes its a good game, the multiplayer states its still in alpha, so there are better games out there, personally iracing does what this lacks very well. as for Ai, I hate to say it but Project cars probably has the best AI I have come across in a modern racing game. For those who havent got this game yet, should you get it? yes, but choose a DLC pack that you will like and stick with, dont go crazy buying all the packs.

5334	1	a	As someone who doesn't come from a background steeped in cricket knowledge or history (I'm American), I wasn't really sure what to expect, but cricket holds a certain novelty for me, and I wanted to give this game a try. Not only am I glad I did, but it has become one of my favorite sports games of all-time.  Tl;dr - If you're a fan of the sport, this is simply a must-have. If you have a passing interest, this game could actually help your understanding of the sport and also happens to be extremely fun and satisfying.  On the surface, just like baseball, cricket is a simple game: throw the ball, hit the ball, catch the ball, curse under your breath when you're out. Just like baseball, though, there is an immense amount of strategic subtlety, and unlike America's pastime, cricket has a much wider range of strategic nuance, offering endless combinations of fielders and bowling styles. DBC14 captures the essence of that strategy by putting players in complete control of their fielding alignments and customizing them for bowlers, batsmen, or both.  Which brings me to the crux of cricket and of DBC14 - what goes on at that little brown strip in the middle of the field. Bowlers are offered a wide array of options, especially pace bowlers. Toy with line and length, swing the ball to and fro, whatever you want to do to go for wickets. All this complexity is broken down into a relatively straightforward control scheme that is easy to learn but difficult to master. Pace bowling is definitely harder to get the timing on than spin bowling, but it's the pace men who offer the most excitement and get the most wickets.  Batting is also somewhat straightforward. Batsmen have the ability to survey the field and get ideas on how to attack it, can choose to go for a shot in the air or along the ground or play a sweep. It's all mapped out quite cleanly, but the big key I found was timing; especially with pace bowlers, getting a good feel for the rhythm of the deliverly lets batsmen time the ball up and crush it. If the player is in rhythm, it's not difficult to churn out 20-30 runs an over, especially in T20 when bowlers are more aggressive. By that same token, mistime a big swing for the ropes, and you're down a wicket. Bowling AI is smart and will adjust even within overs to cover areas where you're consistently putting the ball, forcing you to stay on your toes and play an all-round innings at the crease.  I will say that running and fielding felt a bit clunky. It was tough to know if I had hit the ball right to a man in the field because of the way the camera swings around, and (at least early on) I had a few run-outs because I got a little trigger-happy, but I also missed out on runs because I couldn't see where the ball was. It'd be helpful, too, when fielding, to have a diagram of where each button throws the ball. I still don't have it down and will find my fielder throwing at the bowler's stumps when the keeper has the other batsman dead to rights. Ultimately, though, I can forgive those things because the most important aspects of the on-field experience are just so strong.  The game has a variety of ways to play the sport, with all the Test nations, the three major domestic leagues (England, Australia, and India), and a bevy of formats covered, and if you don't like what's on offer, players can create their own content through the Don Bradman Academy, a robust customization engine where everything can be tweaked. (And, since this game contains little or no licensed content, players can create their own approximations of modern cricketers and teams). Players can also create their own leagues, tournaments, tour schedules, and even formats of the game through the DBA. It's a wonderful little tool that adds tremendous depth to what could have otherwise been a rather pedestrian between-match experience, and it might be my favorite feature of the entire game.  I guess my biggest complaints are the lack of licensed content (addressed by the Don Bradman Academy system, but it's not quite the same), and the menu music. They only included a handful of tracks that get quite tiresome after a while, and I haven't found any way to add custom music to the game. That would be a wonderful feature that would keep me playing this game forever. Heck, I'm probably playing this game forever anyway. Run, don't walk, to buy Don Bradman Cricket 14.

This is it but there are loads of other cars that you test drive for free whenever you want and as many times as you want. The tracks unfortunately are not testable. Any DLC cars can NOT be used in races or Championships.

22	1	a	Great music, good idea behind the game but hard to master.  Why? Because if you want to make good scores, you have to be precise and avoid crashing on the buildings.  This game is about jumping from the top of a building (or a mountain or anything else) and to pass near every obstacle, to make a tag, to flip the bird or to make a cool gesture, to break plates with points on them, etc etc..  The graphics are good but the real strong point of this game is the music. Dat soundtrack.  Anyway, I really enjoyed that UFO from Dejobaan... if anything, it's thanks to Aaaaa that I played other games by them like Drunken Robot Pornography or The Wonderful End of the World.  Really recommended for fun.

However, upon completing the practice course under the guidelines I was given, I was lost as to what to do next. I tried pretty much every button and tab and either it said it was locked or I must purchase it. Another problem was that, for such a free game, there was so much and too much to purchase. They should have just made it for purchase instead of making it free and making and infinite amount of content purchasble. I was disappointed.

4938	0	a	It's clear that, on the developer's list of priorities, the game's features and ability to engage took second place to how it would be monetised. Some of the worst habits of game publishers are on display here, and to add insult to injury, the game they're corrupting here wasn't really worth paying for in the first place.

5431	1	a	Not only the best cricket, but one of the best sports games period.  Pros -Career Mode and Character Creation -Cricket Academy (Allows you to mod/edit/alter players/teams/upires/uniforms etc) -Rewarding gameplay (All aspects of batting, bowling and fielding covered) -All Cricket formats covered (Test, First Class, ODI, List A, T20I, T20 etc) -Great graphics with some added filter options -Wonderful sound design including match announcers  Cons -A few small things that don't detract from the game experience I.E. Unable to change your characters batting position, bat, clothing etc once selected at the start of career mode

5237	1	a	RaceRoom... This game has a really good concept to it. It is about 20GB's big which means it has alot to it. It has alot of maps, and you can play online which makes it nice. The game is complicated as â¥â¥â¥â¥ when you first start, but it gets easier. Finally found a good racing game for PC, it is also really good on FPS. Anyone can run it, trust me.  11/9 would play again

5432	1	a	Graphics, game concept (Carrer Mode), level of playing are good but not very competitive and challenging after initially few weeks.  Devs have giving good precious in new stuffs like hawk eye, DRS, the stumps camera etc but graphics has disappointed. Repeated commentry lines makes me turn off my speakers while playing.  Somethings are unrealistic and frustrating, I play national game in India as well as play county game at the same time. Striker (batsman) play defensive shot of the last overs (while needing 3 runs to win of 2 balls)  Having said that, Its one of the best cricket games for PC, Good Game but needs a lot of fine tunning and more response from the developers or interactive game developers in the forums.  Tons of questions and suggestions are unanswered by them in the forums. We are kept in dark regarding the next update or what to expect in the near future in terms of game patches.  FYI, last patch was updated 3 months back, and no signs of new patches - makes me lose interest in playing these days.   Still I Would recommend the game, just for the expreince of carrer mode, seeing yourself play from club team to captaining the National team (lol in 2-3 season).

4293	1	a	This game is amazing with a group of friends, especially when you get super agile!
4261	1	a	It's literally just a game about going â¥â¥â¥â¥ing fast. Also has items to screw over your opponents. Has workshop support, mostly for maps. It also has plenty of maps to choose from in the vanilla game. The only negative about this game is that it puts the 1st place runner on a disadvantage, because of the way the camera works. So basically, The first place runner will have a smaller field of view than all the other runners.  Edit: also, you get lots of skins throughout the game as you level up. They're really cool. I think they're 70% of the things that make me keep playing the game, to be honest.

146	1	a	While full immersion, force-feedback enabled first-person base jumping games are still a ways out of the reach of current technology, Reckless Disregard makes me hopeful for the future. In the meantime, I will utilize my high suspension of disbelief stat and create my own immersion while plummeting to my death in this game.  Good times!
537	0	a	If you came looking for more Trials after playing Trials Evolution, this is a big downgrade. Mainly the controls are extremely sensitive and finicky and just handle poorly, which makes this whole experience much more frustrating than it needs to be compared to the others in the series, which are much more fun.
4200	1	a	Speed Runners is anamazing game that grasps so many concepts.When you look at the game and watch some videos about it you think that it will get boring, YOUR WRONG. This game is amazing because of how many characters there are and how competitive it is when you do ranked matches. If you don't like competitive matches then you can always just do quickplay which is casual and is fun. I love in the game how it has so many characters and all of them are so unique. I also like how there are so many different power ups this allowing you to be almost blown up but then to grab somebody and replace them in your spot. As you get better in the game you master the ways of shortcuts allowing you to be dead last and then end up being first. Trust me get this game. Even though this game is worth the 16 dollars this type of game should be 10 dollars. If you are unsure about buying then wait and get it on the next sale it is worth it. 9.99/10 because of price

4414	1	a	Kinda disgusted at this crappy attempt to make a few more bucks with little effort done to do it properly.  The lack of a tutorial mode or even a manual meant I spent ages working out how to teleport more players into a game and eventually I found out how through an online forum.  In saying that, you can get past that part eventually by just learning on your own. What really grated me was the misleading comment about playing against the computer ai. That is total bulls**t. The only option to playing against the ai is a lame exhibition mode, unlike the bloodbowl series where you have proper single player campaigns.  Don't waste your money on this one.

381	1	a	This game is awesome, just like it says. It's an adrenaline rush, and it's stupidly fun. It's completely random at times, but the actual gameplay has stunning graphics and great background music. So far no bugs. The controls are fairly good, sometimes they can be tricky when you have to wasd-ctrl-leftclick-rightclick-space all at once, but that doesn't come up often enough to be annoying. Just enough to be challenging. Don't take it too seriously, get past the tutorials and into the fun. Should bear a motion-sickness and epilepsy warning though. Also, turn down the volume before you start, or you might get a nice headphone-blast in the beginning. Totally worth it. I have no regrets.

5503	0	a	Don't get me wrong, this is a fantastic game. I've put a lot of hours into it and I've enjoyed nearly all of them. However, I have a couple of friends who also play it, and we were looking forward to playing 2v1 online when it was announced. At no stage was it mentioned that only 2 machines could connect to a session, and as we have no way of any of us being on the same machine we can't. I understand that there's limitations on bandwidth that come with 2v2 but to only say that 2v2 online is being introduced without any mention of only 2 machines being able to connect is pretty poor in my opinion. We were also trying to get another friend to purchase it with the intention of playing 2v2, and we're glad that we tried it before hand otherwise he would have spent a lot of money on a misunderstanding.
3201	1	a	If you need local activity, buy this game. Plain and simple. I cannot even review the 1 player because I've never played haha. This is one of the ultimate couch gaming experiences. I can play with my 8yr son or my 30 year old fiance. This is a great game for all ages that never gets old. I would even pay full price!

4539	1	a	After almost two years of floaty physics, stuttering, bad communication, outrageous prices and lack of racing, R3E is finally turning around.   Regular sales bring the content to more sensible prices, the force feedback has been tightened up to give better information about the car, the physics are more precise and very detailed and the setup makes a big difference. Most of the racing right now is in the DTM series, but the challenges are fun and allow you to try several cars and tracks without paying a dime.   Visually, it's a bit bright and bold, but the environments look good and clear. Visibility and details are high, and the shadows passing on the dashboard look really nice. The performance on High settings with 8x AA with a 750ti is 60 fps when there's only one car, so I think the optimization is pretty good as well.  The sounds are probably the best you'll hear in a racing game, whether it's the samples themselves or just the richness of the chassis squeaking, the transmission, the tires, etc. Everything is there and sounds great. No other game comes close.  The interface is still complex and confusing, and some options are only available from the main menu. The FFB is very adjustable, but the settings are not explained much, so it takes a lot of fiddling to get everything right. For me, that means G25 and TH8RS. The modern cars don't default to auto-clutch, which is lame.   Because the game looks and sound so good, and now that the FFB is finally letting the new and tighter physics shine through, Raceroom is becoming a killer racing game. I never thought it could be possible, but out of this could arise a GTR3 people have hoped for. In the meantime, doing time trials, challenges and racing in DTM is a lot of fun.  To newcomers: skip the free content and go straight for the competitions, this is where the higher quality content is. It cycles through cars and tracks regularly, so you can sample stuff until you find what you like. The freebies are still the old wobbly garbage from 2012, it seems. I think everything will be updated over time.

215	1	a	From the most disinterested newcaster, to the unusual guides to making cookies, AaAaAA!!! is a game that will pull you along for the fall (literally). You are a base jumper in a floating city the seems to have a 'â¥â¥â¥â¥ the government!' attitude, and you jump off buildings, falling close to other buildings to gain points. If this doesn't seem interesting to you then you need help.  You can graffiti buildings, flip off spectators, smash into birds, break through scoring glass, fly so close to rugged mountains that you'll lose your belly and â¥â¥â¥â¥ yourself laughing at some of the in-game antics.  Buy this game, you'll never regret it.

147	1	a	Fun game for what it is. Its like a game where you jump off a building trying to either pass through point circles or 'touch' other buildings while falling. A bit tricky to get a good score. Played the heck out of it during the Portal 2 Arg. Then never touched it again.
4962	1	a	Great experience! Most of the cars feels 'easy' to drive at high speeds, and i mean it like they seem to be smooth just like the real ones, Ive seen too many racing games where you reach the top speed and the car starts to wobble like its made of jelly! Seriously!? these cars are built to be stable aS â¥â¥â¥â¥ at top speeds! and in overall the handling feels solid and you can adjust these cars endlessly. One of the few CONÂ´s i can think is that it still sometimes feels kinda un-polished (dont mean the cars alone) and there could be more players in multiplayer... and speaking of multiplayer, most of the drivers there seems to drive clean. Sure there are some rammers but they are the ones who generally get bored of the game very early.  It also has the finest track ever made!   You can complain about the pricing of the cars but atleast you can just buy one car from each group (and test it before buying)  So overall i think this is the best racing game at the moment. AND the sound effects leave any other car game light years behind!  Try it, buy it, love it!

4402	1	a	Comes close to the most fun I've ever had couch-playing. It's a great party game: + fun + 2-5 minutes per game (can change players quickly so it doesn't get boring for anyone) + ultra easy to learn + impossible to master + so much to unlock  but not a perfect game: - laggy online multiplayer - few online players - story is just an extra long tutorial - Trails are way to expensive  I personally wouldn't buy it as single player or online multiplayer game. For couch multiplayer it's a MUST-HAVE though!

5352	1	a	Hands Down ! Best Cricket Game Ever !
5336	1	a	In short: this is the best cricket game I've ever played.   The controls felt really strange initally, but just playing the demo and batting in the nets was a strangely satisfying experience. I enjoy all the disciplines and being able to be succesful actually requires skill. I can't claim to be very good at anything in this game, but it feels very similar to my real-life cricketing abilities, so there's that.  I've spend the majority of my time playing the career mode in this game. It feels pretty realistic, except that with some of my performances, i'm sure my county should have left me out of some games.   Is the game perfect? No. The commentary is pretty inaccurate and repetitive. There's a lot of missed catches for seemingly no reason. And although I enjoy bowling, sometimes it's really hit-and-miss about how to dismiss a batsmen. But as that's similar to the real thing, I guess that can't be a complaint.  If you enjoy cricket games, buy it. There's nothing I've played that's come close.

5451	1	a	Awesome game with regular update support from one of the best developers. Please do add an option of choosing between easy stroke play mode OR realistic stroke play. I am getting irritated on how each and every update, either makes the stroke play easy at the rookie level or realistic on the other patch. Many a times I play this game just to relax and would love to get an option of easier stroke play on rookie level forever untill I myself change to option to either a higher difficulty level or the realistic stroke play option.  Was playing a match, and was hitting all over the park, saved the game, shut off the pc,  next day woke up, only to see a new update downloading to play the game, and this time, the same strokes leads not even out of the inner circle with even a little bit of misstiming. I would happy accept the realistic gameplay on certain occassions and do appreciate the efforts that you put in, But no in a mood when I want to relax playing the game. Since the career of dbc14 is my one stop relaxation game since its release.

4780	1	a	Best Race Sim package on the marked right now. There is no way around R3E.       Real racing serieses      Wonderfull content options. You only need to buy what you actually drive. Want to join GT3? 3 bucks for your favourite car and you are in. ( I am kinda lying here: You need tracks as well. The sum will still be well below a full price title.)    Best Sound in genre.    Best AI in genre.    Physics are SimBin quality.    Multiplayer is top notch.   I played pretty much all Sims in past and present, besides AC, which does not come close in terms of content.  Ignore reviewers, who do not understand the economic model of the game.

5491	1	a	Pretty much the closest you'll come to playing cricket without actually playing cricket. I am usually not a fan of sports games and have found cricket games in the past a little lame. This genre usually boils down to 'find the cheesiest method to win easy and repeat over and over'. Not this game.  Game still has some minor issues but nothing I would rate gamebreaking. In fact the only reason these issues stick out is because everything else is so brilliant.  Career mode! There's literally hundreds of hours of play there if you decide to play all the way through to retirement.  A Warning: Batting can be frustratingly difficult beyond the rookie/amateur level due to reaction times otherwise this game is beyond awesome. Bowling on the other hand is way too easy on rookie/amateur levels but starts to get realistic on pro and beyond.  Looking forward to DBC17!

4446	1	a	Definitely one of the very bests racing simulators available today.  The biggest pros are:   - incredible tracks (highly detailed, with very good lightning effects and filled with alive crowds). - sound which simply is totally amazing - very good, detailed FFB - very good competitive AI - consistent vehicle choice - there are actual real racing series represented (WTCC, ADAC, Hillclimb, Historic DTM), not just some random cars from different classes - good multiplayer, even thou it's still in alpha phase it's highly playable without lots of bugs - very impresive development pace - this game is getting better witch each update, and updates are quite frequent - It is possible to test drive each car before you buy it (you can test it as many times as you wish on one test track). This is great way to really choose only the ones you really enjoy driving, no need to blind buy and regret money you've spent.  cons: some important features, like flags are still missing, but they are on the road list.  The games is incredibly immersive, you can really feer like you've been on the track in raceday for real, all parts of it are very well balanced which gives very consistent quality (not like Assetto Corsa, where you get really stunningly looking cars along with tracks which are mediocre at best, poor sounds and totally useless AI).  For me it is currently definitely number one, I highly recommend it.  As for all those negative comments - just look at the time spent in game by the persons that gives negative comment - it says alot.   Also, please bear in mind that this is simulator - you HAVE TO own decent wheel with good FFB to really enjoy it, otherwise if you use gamepad or even keyboard (!) you will have hard time and lots of frustration trying to control the car. Sorry guys, it's not NFS, you wouldn't try to drive real car with keyboard.

102	0	a	Achievement progress at time of writing: 5/7 (71%)  This is more like a puzzle game, with stages in which you need to base jump, get close to structures, perform actions, and land within a target. It's pretty simple mechanically, though it wasn't very engaging. There is almost zero story, just something about it being the new sport of the future.  What you see in the trailer is pretty much the game. I personally did not enjoy it all that much.

5273	0	a	You may ask yourself about this review, that this dude couldn't possibly know what he's talking about, he hasn't even played a full 30 minutes! Actually, I played 0 minutes. Because I couldn't get to play. Here, is why.   [I have also, a link at the bottom of this review, to show you visually what I went through.]  Firstly, on start up, my mouse cursor goes straight up to top of screen at a fast rate, and IT WILL NOT STOP. The only real reason I was able to login correctly is thanks to the arrow keys and the enter button that is found on my keyboard and I'm sure many many others as well. I couldn't acess the menu option because again, mouse was all over the fkn place. LEt alone select any game modes, and it is listed that it has at least partial controller support. Which leads us to the NEXT FK UP. :D  Second! The game screwed up my controller profiler or SOMETHING, and caused me to have to restart my rig. [Which I did not want to do at the time, but I was FORCED to by this games doing. Thanks.] Here is how!  When I connected my controller to my pc, via wireless gaming adapter from Microsoft. [drivers up-to-date], it popped a notification on screen saying, 'Device Found. Profile Loaded'. My controller did not function on the menu whatsoever, and I wouldve loved to maybe see if it needed to be enabled or configured, but again I COULDN'T because of the mouse issue and no way to navigate the menu ANY OTHER WAY[keyboard/controller]. The controller will flash with a ful green circle as if its trying to connect. It scared me for a moment because before I could fully test my controllers status, I thought that this thing just screwed up my profiler and would cause me to have another task to endure to getting it fixed, [which ended up being a pc restart]. I did find that it was actually connected the whole time, before restarting, I went on to big picture mode, to find the controller was working and navigating through the menus, YET IT STILL FLASHED. Even after disconnecting and offing the controller, when turned back on, it would only flash, but still be connected. So I restarted PC and it fixed. But how did I get out of the game? Well you'd be surprised, because THAT is the THIRD topic of error I want to announce.  THRIDLY. I could not exit the game for the life of me, I had to be a ninja on top notch to figure this â¥â¥â¥â¥ out. And after everything going on previously, my mind was already strung out. I couldn't click on anything obviously, a double esc press can't exit you out, you press escape, you MUST CLICK Yes or No buttons. But I couldn't because it was zipping to top of screen. So I tried windows button. Lol nope. So I tried to start task manager, but every time I'd go to click on it when it appeared and I was 'out of the game', It shot me back to the horror-puzzle free to play that I downloaded apparently. Because it was just that, a puzzle, on how to figure out how to get the â¥â¥â¥â¥ to work, and it horrified me in the process. I've done enough troubleshooting today.  In short, the only thing that was racing in or about this, was my mouse cursor. And myself. It has â¥â¥â¥â¥ed my entire day up, all of this happened and it's not even Noon yet. BRUH.   Race-outofmyfkn-Room Racing Experience. [Mouse Cursor Edition]  And devs, I don't mean to sound overly harsh, but this literally has â¥â¥â¥â¥ed my entire mood for gaming the rest of the week, for ANY genre, just any game in general. And even if I were to get it fixed, the drive for me to play it has completely vaporized, and wouldn't be worth a fraction of a second more out of my life TBH. It probably wasn't worth all this effort anyways. This was overall, â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ saddening.  You've really outdone yourselves, guys. Congrats. Now Devs, go out to Wal-Mart, and buy the whole team a slice o' fkn cake, how about it??   Good day. Lol [ Link to evidence  https://youtu.be/g9KMsLdSwH8  ]

309	1	a	Picked this up as part of another bundle, but ended up being surprisingly fun in its own right.
4734	1	a	Its a decent enough racing sim, only problem with the free to play games is the content that you have to buy in game so that you can at least compete to a competant level,  cashcow, thats what i would say this game is to the developers simbin, i havent really played that much to be honest as the car you start off with and subsequnt others that YOU will have to buy to be able to compete, is overall what put me off the game, Either way you look at it, it is a good sim for the racing fanatics out there, just not enough for me IMO, Overall : 7.00/10.00  was an 8.00, but down marked due to lack of cars at start, and having to buy them to get anywhere decent within the game, One thing i will note is that this game has a huge online community and friendly one too, so any body reading my review,  the ball,  as they say,  is in your court now. Cheers mark117h
45	1	a	Only got this game mainly because of the competition, but its actually pretty fun. The basics is you use the wasd to controll your characters while hes falling and you do stuff during the fall to gain points before you get to the end and land...  The design is strange and the presentation sucks, but the core gameplay is actually fun and you unlock new 'abilites' during the way to keep the core game interesting. Add to that you can unlock any level you want from the level select screen you wont get bogged down on one level you cant get through. Gain rank in a level, 1-5 stars, gives you 'teeth' points and these points are used to unlock new levels. The concept works.  The resolution could have been better, but I recommend it while its on sale at 75% off and the competition level is the first one to the left you can unlock next to the introduction text boxes. The ach is pretty simple and you can also view it on Youtube if you serach the level 'Mash Face Against Mountain'.

575	0	a	The Extreme Paintbrawl of kart-racers. You're stuck with the AI since the community (rightfully) died and said AI can be gamed to always lose if you just hit escape and go into the menu. They begin running directly forward and never changing direction.  Custom servers also a crapshoot - it refused to let me play another mode/level than 'Punchbowl' and 'tag' no matter what I set it to.  I didn't really think people needed to be warned away but damnit, if I'm gonna play this for a bit, I'm gonna write about it too.

340	1	a	Even though Im not good at this game I love it!! Its got a whimiscal take on those first Skydiving games on older phones, pre smartphone not old smartphones, where you had to fall through hoops to get points. Here you get to fall through flosting buildings, weave in and out of tight spots, and then land. The gameplay is lots of fun and the movement controls are a bit slow, I kind of wish they could be a litle more crisp especially for weaving through the tight spots, but the game was designed to emulate skydiving, so its not really a big surprise.   Pros: Simple controls; Its a fun game  Cons: The movement feels slow to me, but i am NOT good at this game;  For me this game is really fun i would recommend buying this game on sale as 10$ is a little pricey in my books for this kind of game, but then again i am a pretty frugal person, but this game is totally worth a look when its on sale, since you can usually get all of Dejoban games in a collection for super cheap.

The game really comes into its own once you have got competent at all the basics and played most of the basic mode levels then charge in to the 'awesome' mode which is much faster and honestly even more fun. Just like in real life, hugs and kisses are very moreish, and in the week I've been playing it I keep wanting to come back to it for about an hour at a time. Plus I keep getting amusing chat reactions to 'Gagaman is currently playing AaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!!' which is a bonus.

4132	1	a	  At the time I wrote this review, I obtained it through family sharing. I have now purchased this game.  this game is wonderful. active community, great maps, exellent soundtrack (please make us able to buy the ost, i'll buy) and the gameplay? PERFECT! It's got that mario kart feeling, where even if you're 2good4quickmatch (there's a great ranked mode), you still fear for your life cuz you know that one pleb behind you might find out he has the golden claw equipped (which is like a blue shell, but more vicious), and that alone can f*ck you up real good. the items are diverse, and most of them have drawbacks (badly timed bombs can boost the ennemy, the blue sh- i mean golden claw makes you stop running when used, ect.). recently, they added trails (appears when running 2fast), i don't mind them, but some are obnoxiously large, and can distract you. (small edit: there's now an option to hide the trails)  Most content (appart from trails, i think) are locked through leveling, which i think could maybe be earned faster? (pun not itended) they also added dlc, which adds characters based on popular youtubers (ex: PewDiePie, Markiplier, ect.) and yea it's cool  as a final verdict, i rate this 5/7 (joke)  EDIT: Heard of the g 2a key fiasco. they take revenues from tinybuild, and it ain't fair. I'll buy this game ASAP, and please buy games from official sellers, like steam.

4600	1	a	RaceRoom Racing Experience is a thing where you put the lads on the line so they get to the end faster than the other people. Choose from over one gender of driver to completely personalise your profile. Interaction and User experience is more akin to that of a misaligned shoulder cavity but please don't count that against it, it doesn't know any better. Believe me when I say I'm not sure what RaceRooms are but I think we can all agree that this world would be better if I didn't even know they existed.

4621	1	a	Play Simracing since GTR2, so i have a good overview about SImgames. Now we have some good Simracing games like Assetto Corsa and Iracing. The difference between this two games and RRRE is that the Forcefeedack are much more real then the other two games. Enginesound from all cars are more real and you think youre inside your dreamcar.   short pro and contra list:  +Engine Sound +ForceFeedback +collision detection (much much better then Assetto Corsa) +Racing Tracks (not all laserscanned but real similar to the real tracks) +Racecars (DTM13/14,WTCC13,GTR1/2/3/X,GTMasters,Daytona,Procars and much more) +OnTrack Settings like (control, HUD,Sound, etc.)I miss that in Assetto Corsa +dedicated server still in development (comming soon) +RealRace Drivers use this game to train (Sometimes you see one of your Racestar ingame) +everycar have a own setup what you can edit how you want - steering options for everycar +MP: Friends shown as a star in the Serverlist  -/+Microtransactions (You can buy a complete Pack like GTMasters or DTM 13/14. -/+Multiplayer in Alpha Stage (some stuff is missed) -just few onlineplayers -Multiplayer: Training/Qualitime: Players join during sessions, a join lag destroy your Laptime -Setupguide is missing (example. Assetto Corsa explain ingame what every option mean) -MP: Loadtime while joining a server take a long time (maybe 2-3 minutes)   Most stuff is in development and the devs are working hard.

5029	0	a	I really want to like this one, but it is simply released to the public way too early. The graphics are okay, but the colors are weird, especially in terms of sky and lighting. I also experience graphics glitches like flickering shadows or polygons and the complete cockpit disappearing for a fraction of a second on some parts of the sweden hillclimb track. Soundwise, the game is relatively good. But I find some motor sounds extremely annoying and overdone. The physics are good enough for a sim, but the force feedback currently is just wrong. It doesn't reflect the movement on screen too well, which makes driving kinda confusing. The UI simply needs a huge overhaul. The overall feeling of product quality is pretty low, when you experience things like the whole menu freezing and having to kill two ingame browser processes to make it work again. The amount of free content is a joke, while the cars are okay, the two tracks aren't. Currently, the amount of available tracks to buy is too low, and important ones like the Nordschleife are missing. The pricing policy on the content overall is an impudence.  I know that it is work in progress, but it doesn't even feel like a solid beta to me. If you are looking for great PC sim racing, you'll get the best overall package with Race07 / Race Injection and its extensions. Lots of good content, good physics and force feedback, a finished and great product for a low amount of money. And if you are really into physics and graphics are not important to you, I recommend rFactor 2. It is still in development, which moves on pretty slowly in terms of content, but it has the most advanced physics simulation and very solid force feedback plus a great AI. If you want DTM, DTM Racedriver 3 will give you much more value than the DTM Experience addon for RaceRoom. And if you want the best multiplayer racing experience, well - people seem to love iRacing (but I haven't checked that out).

4996	0	a	Very poor driving experience, the game is HD but the graphics don't excel.  The menu is very hard and mazed up.  As an actual ingame footage... on every challange you are allowed to controll your car after 3 seconds on which if you continuously press the acceleration button you will lose controll of your car immediatelly. No to mention that everytime you are forced to start the game on a curve.  There are 3 dificulties that you can chose BEFORE you enter a race, once you are in it, you cannot adjust them. Novice- the one that the AI breaks like your grandma' Normal - the decent way to play this game aaand Advanced - unplayable from keyboard   Few tracks, few cars. You are forced to play a specific car on a specific race.   The game looks ok from the outside but its not worthing the time waiting to install.  Cheers, predatorX

529	1	a	Never have I loved a game more. Never have I hated one so so much. Trials can be very addicting trying to get that 'perfect run' but at the same time oh so frustrating when you fall just short of the end. The best part is that it is never the games fault when you fail. And you always know it. It is incredibly rewarding to finally get through a track without falling, or shaving off just a few tenths of a second off of your time. It's a game that you can play when you only have 10 minutes to play, but can spend hours absorbed too. The controls are tight. There are only 4 buttons to push, but control is deceptively deep and nuanced. The crashes can be hilarious. The tracks are well designed and the difficulty ramps up appropriatly from carefree first levels to the insidiously difficult hard tracks. There is a fairly punishing learning curve about 60% of the way through the tracks, but so satisfying when you get some of the more advanced techniques down. Most games I get excited about have a whole lot to do with the story or the atmosphere of the game. This is one of the very few in recent memory that stand pretty much 100% on the merit of the gameplay itself.

273	0	a	Gameplay: Controls feel awfully inaccurate, pretty bad for a game that is all about precision and speed. You fall down a couple hundrets predesigned levels in first person view and touch the walls or fall thru rings/squares for extra points. Nothing ever changes. Bored me real quick. Graphics: Ok for a small indie titly nothing really great tho.

4969	0	a	The best thing about this game are the sounds. The price model is bad. You can get a better AA-AAA racing title that is just as good for the price. Their older game GT Legends GTR series and Race series are just as good if not better. If Simbin/Sector3 re-release this game as a standalone game with steamworks for multiplayer with dedicated servers and traditional DLC I may consider buying.  Get the older SimBin titles NFS Shift 1/2 and Grid 1 and Autosport and Project Cars You will thank me later Until major changes are made.........
5147	0	a	I have played this for over a week now &amp; can say that I like the driving feel on the circuits especially in keep it real mode (or whatever its called) Once you get the steering settings right its real good. Hillclimb mode however is basically crap. It simulates way to much speed &amp; doesnt feel real at all. Graphics are smooth &amp; look great, the sounds are top notch right down to the gear change exhaust pops to the race brake squeels. The dissapointment hits when you find you have 1 circuit &amp; a handfull of cars to play &amp; everything else costs. The online challenges from what I can see mainly revolve around the DTM Experience DLC which you have to pay for (think its 34.99US) When you consider the latest Grid Autosport is $49.99US on steam &amp; offers a widened track, car &amp; game mode variety including multiplayer, I think maybe a better option.  That said, I am yet to play Grid Autosport and am basing my thoughts on heresay.  In all, Race room is refined in circuit mode but lacks depth without putting your hand in your pockets.

4493	0	a	It's a good game. But WAY too expensive.   To buy all the tracks alone it would cost over Â£80. The game is basically a demo for a HIGHLY overpriced game.   All in, it's unfortunate that this is the economic model we are given. If there was a free to play element with perhaps a War Thunder style tech tree or something (Not sure how it would work but still) it would be possibly the pinnacle of racing games on steam.   Unfortunately what the end user is presented with is a game that would cost in excess of Â£150 to fully unlock with no option to earn any of the unlocks by actually playing the game.   It's a massive shame. I wish it wasn't like this. It was fun to play.

You are just jumping but you do not actually control the trucks, you just do the set up and gas, but no turning. So no reason to play more than 20 minutes of fun in my opinion.

5037	0	a	DISCLAIMER: I DO reconmend this game if you are using a single screen setup.  I have been a huge fan of the SimBin PC games through the years, and R3E definitely has the feel that I like and a great roster of cars and tracks. I am not a fan of the pricing scheme they've got set up for it however... Also, if you have triple screens, don't even bother unless you want to play with distorted fish eye effect. They won't bother to add multi-view like every other decent sim. Maybe one day I'll be able to enjoy this game the way i'd like to.

5538	1	a	I can highly recommend BBCE, but anyone should know its a board game and dices are thrown, so some games can go weird and you gotta love this or end up being frustrated. Everyone who understands that, is able to calculte his chances and can still laugh if dice outcomes go weird will have LOTS of fun. While writing this i have more than 2300 hours spent playing or watching Blood Bowl games that says much about the potential of having fun. Best way to play it for me is looking for private leagues and getting to know your opponents, so talking to them while playing makes it more of a board game again...  The only downsides are: some connectivity issues in MP for some players now and then a few bugs never got patched out running your own leagues you often miss some better administration options  But these are few and the amount of races to play and fun you have makes it up.  Since nobody knows how long the servers will run, buy it on a sale and it can still be a great catch.  (written 12/2015)

5332	1	a	It's rare to find a decent Cricket game since the mid-90s to mid-2000s. During this time it was a battle of two publishers: Electronic Arts and Codemasters. Early iterations of the game were fun and lacked the realism that most sports games demand. If you're considering DBC 14 I also recommend searching for EA's Cricket 96 (PC) or Codemaster's Shane Warne Cricket 99 (PS1) on eBay.   But back to more current matters. DBC 14 is by far the most authentic cricket game since the EA Sports release of Cricket 2005 for the PC and PS2. Running the game for the first time, you are met with an update that thankfully changes all player names to real names. I hope to see an update in the future that contains real stadium names too. Once in the game, you have various game options from 5-over a side to full blown test cricket. You can also create yourself and move up the ranks of world cricket.  The practice arena is great too, reminiscent of a training nets session. From time to time I find myself relaxing in the nets just having a hit. I've only accumulated a few hours on the PC version but I did so, migrating from the XBOX 360 version. DBC 14 has a solid frame rate and feels very smooth. One aspect that still needs improving is the commentary. While not bad, it's not great. It's certainly not as annoying as other sports games (like PES) but not as smooth or free flowing.   I love the camera angles in this game. When playing solo, you are shown your player from the 3rd person perspective. While this is standard fare for bowling in all cricket games, it's quite refreshing for batting and makes the game feel more authentic. Fielding is decent too and the camera angles during play are superb.  At the time of writing this, I'm in search for games during the Steam sale. However I was quite willing to drop the full price for this game for two reasons: Supporting not just a local developer, but one that is willing to put the time and effort to capture a sport that itself has captured millions around the world.

4694	1	a	A very good free to play racing game that could be a bit better in control. What it lacks in fluid controls though is forgiven for its great amount of detail that SimBin put into the environments and cars. The biggest problem though is that you must be online at all times and only about three to four cars and courses are available to you right away. The other cars and courses must be bought in order to use them. Other than that this game is a great download for those who enjoy games like Gran Turismo or Forza Motorsport.

33	1	a	A lot of people seem to like this. I have no idea why. It a freefalling game where you have to do 'stunts' to gain points really. Except, it doesn't look like a freefalling game. Yes, you have the feeling you're falling down, but that's it really. It's all in first person perspective so there's no actual character involved as well. The idea is cool, but its execution is kind of poor. It would've been so much cooler to have a realistic freefalling game. Like the realism of Mirror's Edge and the freefalling/parachute gameplay of Just Cause 2. But that's all just in hindsight. So all in all; it's ok. There aren't a lot of games with this sort of gameplay so I can't really recommend any better alternatives.  [Rating: 70/100]

5030	0	a	Where to start....  For one, you only get 5 out of the 38 cars for free. The rest, you have to buy. Now, maybe this wouldn't be nearly as bad if you could actually choose the cars, but no. You're stuck with what they've already chosen, which means you could end up driving in a class of cars that you might not want two.  Secondly, ona similiar topic, you get 2 generic free tracks out of 14.  Third.I couldn't find a way to rebind keyboard controls. The handling system felt off as such. (I know this is supposed to be played with a wheel and pedals, but I've played plenty of sims without. rFactor 1 and 2, other SimBin titles, Assetto Corsa, etc.) The UI was pretty bad as well.
4199	1	a	  Great game! In this game you simply just try to run faster than your opponent. ItÂ´s very fun with friends. Power ups are awesome. Some players are salty but it doesnÂ´t matter. ItÂ´s not a pay to win game. You can unlock skins and characters by leveling up. There can be little bit glitches but it doesnÂ´t affect the gameplay a lot.. I recommend this game for all kinds of players. If you donÂ´t have friends... GET SOME FRIENDS TO PLAY THIS GAME WITH!
5133	0	a	I probably had the less fun playing this game than any other racing game to date.   I booted up the game and ended up waiting about 7 hours for the confirmation email to come so that I could activate my account and actually log into the game. This is the reason for my 8 hours of play time while I left the game minimized while waiting for the email to come.   I was finally able to log in and was bombarded with the cluster-**** of a menu. There didn't seem to me to be any sort of rhyme or reason to how the menu was set up and the not-so-large amount of content was masked behind a seemingly endless menu, which was all locked behind a paywall anyway.   Once I got into what seemed to be the only track available to me, in what seemed to be the only car available to me, it took me a while to get used to not using a racing line in a game. After ten laps or so I was finally able to race around the track decently quick but was conitinuing to be annoyed by the way the game played.   The physics seemed decent enough, but as far as being any fun.. it felt completely stale and uninteresting to me. The only track available for free didn't appeal to me at all and I didn't care too much for the car either. I was using a controller to race and the game still just felt really rigid, stiff and so unexciting that after a couple more laps I decided that I was done with it.   The final product just felt to me.. well.. free. They put a lot of focus on making the game seem quite real. The game definitely has a unique feel to it that you notice all the way through, but I wasn't going to give any of it a chance when the racing itself just left me bored.  It kinda feels like a free version of Gran Turismo. Except.. not fun.. or good... From head to toe, it's just absolutely not visceral or exciting in the slightest.
