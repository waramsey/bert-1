2437	1	a	An excellent game that is, in my opinion, the best Total Wat game so far. The game handled the transition from the Medieval period well, incorporating the shift towards democracy, parliaments, better technology, gunpowder weapons and the New World very well.
1785	1	a	Great strategy game. love it.
4078	1	a	I loved doing Linebattles online, and singleplayer.  Until my computer took an arrow... to the computer.
103	1	a	Definitely worth buying.
2276	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game .... i CANNOT reccomend this game. My admiral dies at the beginning of the battle as he drops through the ship. Battle only starts for 2 second and 300/300 person ship becomes 298/300 ... people just randomly drown at start of naval battles. This game sucks and is the main reason i will never preorder a total war garbage from this company. SEGA oR ca ... I can however only reccomend this game if you mod it. I got a mod called 'DarthMod '... it makes this game look like the trailers or a movie. This game as it is ... is garbage, physics is garbage, AI is garbage, sound efffects and music is garbage. It NEEDS this MOD to be even worthy of playing.
91	1	a	Super-fun 1-player beat-em-up / tower-defence game.
4642	1	a	One of the nicest indie game I've ever played. You destroy ship to get XP and ressources to buy bigger, better ships to be able to destroy more ships. Each planetary system has 2 factions, and you can choose one faction or the other in each system. Later in the game, you can destroy some zombie ships, and it gives a little more challenge to the game. There is even bounty hunters that are not part of any factions and that can hunt you down if the bounty on your head is big enough. There is one big problem in this game : there is a time when you need to grind a lot. I've played 24 hours and I still haven't finished the game because I need to grind the XP and the ressources to go further in the game. It's truly a good game and I had a lot of fun playing it but it takes a lot of time to finish.
627	1	a	Orky Orky times! = Fun times!
4967	1	a	It's a pretty little top-down space shoot-em-up in a randomly generated size-adjustable galaxy (so there's replay value). I like to dive in now and then and advance a few levels. One unusual item is a list of 'coming soon' features on the menu screen. The 'and bounty hunters' bit is definitely new since I last played, and I seem to see a few new ship blueprints, so obviously they are hard at work adding DLC. Can't go far wrong with this one if you like old style space shooters.
5147	1	a	Awwwwwwwwwwwww yeah. This game is awesome.
2987	1	a	Defiently one of the top Total War games.
1414	1	a	With the Release of Empire, real modding has been disallowed and locked outside of tweaking a few stats. However, the game itself is very playable if it becomes a bit monotonous as you move outward building your Empire. The Battle AI could do with reading the Art of War, but it is acceptable and formations do mostly hold up though there is little real opportunity for real battle tactics against the mob the AI throws at you as you can form, sit, wait, and destroy the enemy as they attack too easily as they use no guile or formation past the opening moves.
1001	1	a	Strategy and killing orcs, what more can you ask for?
5001	1	a	Hey guys. Check out Space Pirates and Zombies. I got it cheap a long time ago and dismissed it originally. The game is actually a blast. Think Asterioids on steroids mixed with Space Run, and a hint of FTL.
4574	1	a	I'd forgotten how good this is. It changed since the first time I played, I think...  Nothing earth-shattering, but if you enjoy the game after the first few solar systems, you'll probably enjoy the rest. And there's a PLOTS too. And you can skip the 'voice acting.' :P
3175	1	a	simply the best :)
796	1	a	Orcs Must Die! is a beautiful game. That's not just the graphics, though the art is highly stylized and very fitting of the game's comical atmosphere. OMD takes the addictive mechanics of the tower defense genre and the fast-paced gameplay of an action RPG and creates a hybrid that works far better then would be expected. At first it just gives you a new tower every level, but then you get magic gauntlets and paladins and skill tree and meta-upgrades; there's a tremendous amount of content in OMD, and a tremendous number of orcs waiting to break through your defenses and charge your portals. If only you had aimed that fireball a little more accurately or placed those tar traps a bit further apart...  Oh well, 'Retry Level.'
1326	1	a	'Your general is dead' k rip thx  Oh yes, oh yes. Now for my pros and cons list Pros: Lots of Units Lots of Countries Lots of Annexing Lots of Capturing Lots of British Lots of India Lots of Trade Lots of Negotiating Lots of Generals Lots of Boats Lots of Horses Lots of cannons  Cons: A lot of the countries, when trying to negotiate with them, are either big jerks or â¥â¥â¥â¥ing stupid. Ex:  Me Offers: All Tech 5000 Dollars 4 Regions Indefinite Military Access Access to Trade Routes Demands: Military Access: 5 turns  NPCs: No 
3493	1	a	This game is great! Many happy hours conquering the world!
1314	1	a	After 100+ hours I have to say for anyone wanting a good strategy game it's well worth * what are they listing it for now * the price.  Pro's -Combat requires some strategy you dont just auto win. -Long campaign   Con's  My navy ships never really worked the way I wanted
2812	1	a	I was going to beat this freebie for the weekend game in time for 4th of July, but after 27 or 46 hours, or however long straight I played this, it froze on me.  Oh well. It would of been a hell of an easier ride if I knew then what I know now about the game. Especially in the American 4th act.  I recommend buying it, even though I won't.
3169	1	a	If you have been looking for a game that incorporates complete full scale wars, then Empire: Total War is your game. The graphics are great, the realism is amazing, and there are huge ammounts of soldiers dueling it out with mount and musket.
515	1	a	Kill some orcs
2759	1	a	Played as the British and destroyed/raided/blockaded every town and port in France.  10/10 would attack France again.
3019	1	a	low audio
3453	1	a	For those who like 'Total War'-games, but think they haven't had enough gunpowder and cannons in them will like 'Empire: Total War' very much. Politacl and economical aspects of this game are quite good, even if AI is sometimes â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ and makes most irrational decisions. But for most of the time AI is behaving and makes good opponent or ally. Battles are engaging and tactical. Player have good array of different kinds of strategies that she can use in different scenarios. No two playtroughs are same. If you like turn based and real time strategy games and enjoy warfare of 1700s this game is good catch. It is fun, intense and can put your skill as general and head of the state to test.  p.s. It is cool to be able to deploy finnish hakkapeliittas to battlefield in this game :)
692	1	a	MORE SPIKE TRAPS!
384	1	a	If you want to fight hordes of Orcs and can't afford Warhammer 40k then this is your game! this game is fun with an awsome soundtrack that causes cavities of the brain.
4652	1	a	This is one of my favorite indie games on Steam - a true gem. Even though it's made by a two-man team, this is an awesome 2D space combat game. It's not laden with overly complicated interfaces and rule systems like a lot of strategy games, yet has enough customizability and complexity to keep the player engaged. Ignore the story, and focus on configuring your ships. My 40 hours on a single playthrough is proof of how much fun I had. Some may find the combat repetitive eventually, but I found the steady trickle of new weapons enough to keep me invested. I love this game and am very excited for the sequel!
2744	1	a	Really good game but way better when you play DarthMod Ultimate Commander (DMUC)!!
2846	1	a	This is an amazing game. I really enjoy the historicle aspect of the game and the way you are able to control your soldiers movments. Empire: Total War has acomplished things other games in the same genre could not.  P.S. Sorry for any spelling errors I can't spell to save my life.
881	1	a	Crazy fun, totally worth it
5078	1	a	30 Hours of pure fun, probably the best indie game ive ever played.

2201	1	a	A great game, It was unfortunately hindered by bugs and performance issues, At first. Now it's patched up and ready to go!.
1543	1	a	It has its flaws like some texture glitches and historical flaws (if you that much of a stickler), But who cares about glitches when you can cheat using esf editor and make the most powerful country on your first turn then invade russia in the winter and have massive sea and land battles with great multi player battles it is fun to actually play a 4v4. It is also one of the better total war games. They always talk about stuff like how 'were working on graphics' I think that empire total war has the second best graphics in the total war series.
3867	1	a	Best ever advanced strategy. You will have best ever spend ho..weeks
2460	1	a	The gold standard for European theatre strategy games. A must for all fans of Sharpe.
985	1	a	Surprisingly fun and addictive!
1311	1	a	First, I need to say I am a fan of history. I love history. I also enjoy video games. So when these two things are combined, they make something awesome. This game is amazing! The graphics are a little dated but still are pleasible. Other than that I have no complaints. If you enjoy history, get this game. Trust me.
1156	0	a	I only blame steam for selling a game that doesnt have support , or atleast they should mention ' warning this game doesnt have a support ' it crashes for me as soon as i start it and at the menue the game crash and something writen in weird language apeare , I posted in the forum but no replay then i found out this game doesnt have support so if you are lucky it will work and if you have any issues thats it you lost what you paid ( sorry for my horrible english -_-)
244	1	a	Killing Orks! Not as Spacemarine this time, but still with a Warhammer, if you preordered.  The Game is comparable to Sanctum, but has a lot more levels and depth. You get an insane amount of Traps, Levels and also Perks later in Act 2. I really enjoy it.  Could have more Achievements though :p.
2286	0	a	The game refuses to play on my Mac. Click 'Play' button on the startup screen and CRASH!
4948	1	a	Four words: space pirates and zombies. Enough said. Or maybe not quite enough said. This game is more fun than you can ever imagine.
2010	1	a	The only game where you can invade Russia , in the winter.
897	1	a	An addictive 3rd person strategy defense romp. This game throws you into the role of the last warmage defending rift portals against waves of orcs, ogres, goblins and more. The maps make you think carefully about where to place your arsenal of various traps. Traps such as brimstone which scorches the ground or your very own army of elven archers. Some clever cutscenes placed here and there give emphasis on a story, uncommon in this genre. To add to longevity each map has 3 difficulties, leaderboards, and skulls you must earn to improve your traps.  A fantastic game for any fan of action or strategy games!
1287	1	a	You enter enemies to weaken them, powerups to improve them, yourself to fix your combos... recursively!
559	1	a	Holy crap this game is addicting. Now at the time of writing this recommendation, I haven't beaten it yet...BUT...man this game is just sooooo good. It's just...cuz...like....URRRGGHH! Tower defense gameplay, with third person shooter gameplay. GReAT mix. The graphics are awesome, sound/music is great, and level design hits the sweet spot. You've GOT to get this game. I was able to get this when it was on sale and MAN what a steal that was. HIGHLY recommend this game. Lot's of fun ^_^
4166	1	a	This was my first Total War game, and it really made me fall in love with the series as a whole. What is most impressive is the campaign, with nine playable empires and the whole world map on offer, which makes planning ahead all the more important. The long campaign spans from 1700 to 1799, giving the player the chance to establish a strong economic base (one of the most enjoyable aspects is dominating the map by the end of a campaign). The battle gameplay is also good, with a wide range of histrorically accurate units to choose from, with lends a very strategic element to each battle, as the player has to no how to counter the troops of the opposing side; a skilled player can gain victory over a numerically superior army. The online gameplay is solid, with only occasional lag issues. There are only a few minor downsides. There are occassional glitches and freezes (approximately one every fifty battles), Cavalry is very underpowered, which limits their effectiveness. They are useful against unprotected artillery and countering other mounted units, but one small infantry group can rout a far larger cavalry force. Finally, the general, while very important, has a limited range of gameplay options; the same level of morale is offered regardless of where the general is in relation to the rest of the fighting force, as long as if the general is alive or on the battlefield. Overall however, Empire Total War is an amazing tactical and historical experience, which I would gladly recommend to anyone. I would give it a score of 8/10
313	1	a	The only critism is the lack of some sort of multiplayer/Co-op. This game is awesome!!!!!!
612	1	a	I get why the Orcs need to die, I really do. But do they HAVE to die? The game never explains why they have to die, or why the wan't to capture the time portal's so badly. Surely their primitive hierarchy of wants and needs can be satisfied with the help of some magic. We don't even know the full story, maybe the portals are Samuri-Jack style way to the past before evil mages took over the orcis agricultural utopia that once existed before hand. We just cant know for certain and for that reason I am a consiencous objector to killing orcs as a TF2 inspired scout-mage until the developers explain why the orcs absolutely 100% MUST die.
1425	1	a	best of the series.
1165	1	a	This is definitely a step up from their initial release with Renaissance. Basically every aspect seems to have been improved and campaign maps tweaked. Quite a few new side quests have been added as well :) Totally worth it on a 50% or better sale!
13	1	a	Wasn't expecting much from this. Wasn't expecting much at all. Then I played the game and slapped myself in the face. Later I looked in the mirror and berated myself for being an idiot. Then I wiped away my self-inflicted tears and went back to my computer with new tears in my eyes... tears of joy brought by this game.
2472	1	a	Still the best Total War to date 2014
2709	1	a	I absolutly love this game I have enjoyed every campaign more than the last and with 1000 hours on the clock that means alot. I think Sega should make a game like ETW and its twin NTW in the middle 1800's to the world wars to create a time with the evolution of the traditional calvary transformation into the tank and small battles of the modern day guerilla warfare that displays a map of the whole world, with concluding this I suggest to sega to work together with paradox plaza to create (GTW) Global total war.  ps. I hope my advice and expertice can help message or email me at  weroberts2001@icloud.com  for any questions about this game or any advice i can share with you and will be pleased to do so. 
4669	1	a	Super addictive space hot-rodding combat game. Very replayable due to generated universe. Low price for a lot of fun. Highly recommend!
1730	1	a	Best new features in the serise hands down. That makes the game more fun.
694	1	a	If you have played Dungeon Defenders, this feels just like it expect it's single player. It is a great game, all the traps and weapons feel really nice and the game will always give you a challenge.
967	1	a	Leave those poor orcs alone damn it !
145	1	a	Orcs Must Die is a tower defens / shooter video game.  I'm personal really big fan of this games. You not only try to defens yourself and the portal with traps and towers. Because you have the option to fight your own. Charcter has a small amount of upgrades and new weapons to unlock and choice. It's has a very big number of challanges to complete to clear the full game. Very nice to play alone.. and alone because there is no freaking multiplayer... for this buy part 2. Easy to control video game and playing it with a controller plays very nice.  No co-op multiplay still.. a must have game for the tower defense / shooter lovers. I give this game a 8/10.
1190	0	a	While I really like the game play and the fighting mechanics, It is really hard to get started in any quest. The random encounters are way to overpowered for any level 1 party to get starred I had to give up. Do not buy.
2732	1	a	A very good all around great game. The bugs have been worked out and the game near perfect.
4392	1	a	Better than the reviews ever stated
389	1	a	Hilariously fun.
5259	1	a	This is, like, a message from the Resistance, man. F*ck you too, dudes, just say no to cannibalism! ZOMBIES are REAL!!!!
385	1	a	Most awesome tower defense game ever. There is a tough difficulty curve, but I've never felt cheated or forced into buying the DLC. In fact, I've beaten all the levels (even on Nightmare) without it. There is tons of replay value with this game due to the sheer number of weapons and traps and maps available.   I love this game from the humor to the artwork to the gameplay.  The only thing I felt it was lacking was co-op, something that the second game brings in.
5301	1	a	Bought it, kept playing, still remember it fondly.
4691	1	a	Asteroids meets Serious Sam?
1317	1	a	I would def recommend this game! One of my favorites of all the Total War strategy games.  1. Huge map encomapssing the whole world 2. quite a large variety of nations and units 3. easily 400-500 hours of gameplay 4. Favorite of all the total war games so far.
2529	1	a	Empire total war is a brilliant strategy game about my favourite period in history:the eighteenth century. As in other total war games you start of on the campaign map that is similar to the civilization games, but when you encounter an enemy on the map you go into a real time strategy battle with large armies of various kinds of soldiers , naval battles, fort sieges, and land battles. Fantastic game I love it
1753	1	a	If u like line warfare this is the game for u  10/10
2569	1	a	Empire, the first time we all got to the see the dream killing warscape engine. For those of you looking for a great total war video on its many problems I recommend Dr. Reynold Sanity on youtube. If you can stand Australian cynical and somewhat offensive humor he makes a lot of great points. Nails it on the head.  For the price I would pick the game up but just watch your calavary chase after a routed unit and yea..... Watch as the entire unit chases one man while the others run in the opossite direction and then just sit around. Even after uncountable patches this game is still rather messy. The AI while no longer creating armies of 7 cannons and a single skirmisher (not all the time) is a bit better, they are still pretty bad even by total war standards. On the plus side they will form large fleets and armies. Id ignore the campain all together. It culminates in fighting a British army who only buys native horse musketmen who are the best guys you want to gaurd a fort and man the wall.   Random agent spawning is frustrating as well. Still if you like the time period get it or napoleon. Stay away from Rome 2. While many praise shogun 2 for its polish it is still hurt by the warscape engines lack of collision detection and only allowing 1vs1 melee. Enjoy watching your men circle a single unit and get cut down one at a time.   For the last great melee total war you want medievil 2. Although Shogun is pretty solid. They just need to really overhaul or just go back to the old engine with better looking models.  Still have to recommend.
864	1	a	There are Tower Defence games, and then there are games like Ork's Must Die. I very action packed game with a major focus on letting the player getting some insane kill counts and the like along with some brutal animations to follow. It ramps up the challanges as you progress, and offers allot of tools for you to pick, choose, and play around with to figure out what stratergys go best with your play style. This game also never once holds your hand, expecting you to figure things out on your own and run with it.   If there are any real flaws towards this game, it's base price at times feels a wee steep in my pocket for a 20 stage ( x2 if you count nightmare mode's alt mob waves ) single player experance with maxing out skulls, and climbing the leaderboards the only thing left once done with it. But admittily for $15, you are getting something that looks and plays like a full buget game as well, and that's pretty nice for a new devloper.  Regardless highly recommended.
1495	1	a	Native American eviction simulator 11/10 would genocide again
4269	1	a	LOVED IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
829	1	a	Loved. Every. Moment.
1973	1	a	This game, unlike most strategy games is great. It is mostly correct historically, and the campaign makes sense
1710	1	a	empire total war is a cool and fun game where you fight nations and grow and conquer , the game is awesome the battle on land is amazing fun and stratigic with alot of replayability , however the thing that is most disappointing about the game is that sea battles are not fluid and fun , the reason i bought the game because i thought it is the best age of sail game but its not what i expected but it is playable and you might like it
1411	1	a	Best strategie game ever  its complex huge and means what it calls total war  if you give yourself time you can have days of good strategie  i like it more as rome 2 ot shogun 2 because its unlimited you havend a generals limit or else  that what i say before total war
1564	1	a	After putting in a few days worth of my life into this game over the past few weeks I feel slightly more qualified to write a review now. This is the second Total War game I've played, I put a few hundred hours into Medieval II so I won't be comparing it to any other TW games.   Campaign Mode: 8/10 Battle Mode: 7/10  Naval Battle: 8/10  Land Battle: 6/10 Soundtrack: 9/10 Multiplayer: 5/10 Overall: 8/10 I would definitely recommend buying this if youâre a fan of strategy games however I would wait until itâs on sale simply because of how damn buggy it was. I had my first save game corrupted after about 50 turns and after that I had numerous crashes and bugs. The AI was pretty brutal on the campaign map but almost laughably easy to fight against in battle modes, there were numerous times where I could fight off armies numerous times larger than my own simply by letting them charge and eat my canister shot.  
2038	1	a	I just can't get enough of this game. Epire Total War 2 please but fix RTW 2 first, lol.
3266	1	a	almost no lag with high graphic settings  depends on the amount of units really but your hardly ever going to have maximum amount of units at once ever
3307	1	a	One of the best games ever
2352	1	a	Get it. Install DarthMod. Explode.
604	1	a	Good orginal.. innovative game.. and cheap if on sale.
4723	1	a	VENT ALL THE ATMOSPHERES!
5095	1	a	Really fun game, although it does not look appealing at first, it is a really good game, if you are into these kind of games that is.
4286	1	a	The first battles with lines of riflemen which would make Fall of the Samurai the brilliant game it is. Naval battles which were fun and challenging. An era we haven't played in too often. Great game for its time, still worth to be played.
3131	1	a	One of the many installments of the Total War game series, Empire Total War is really a bit different from the earlier installments. First off, the graphics look great and the gameplay is nice and smooth. In Empire Total War you can actually fight sea battles (which was not possible in earlier installments) which can be a real pain in the â¥â¥â¥, but rewarding and fun at the same time. The premise is quite simple: choose one of the many populations and expand your territory and crush your enemies. Many changes have been made in the gameplay (in respect to e.g. Rome Total War) which make for a more realistic gameplay. For instance, you can now demand a besieged city for its honourable surrender and every city has it's own 'Town Watch' so you don't have to leave garrisons in all of cities. However, not everything is better than its predecessors, for example: you can't hire mercenaries anymore, there is a fairly limited number of different types of unit and the AI has not improved as drastically as some of the other aspects of the game. All in all, Empire Total War is a brilliant game which looks nice, works smooth and can indeed be challenging. However, after a while it is not difficult to learn the weak spots of the AI (and there are quite a few) and you will notice that almost all battles will have the same pattern. Still, you will have quite a lot of fun (and sometimes frustration) from playing this game.
1289	1	a	Have you ever wanted a fresh cup of tea made with the freshest and finest of Indian tea?  Maybe you wish to invade India and create an empire of tea and corruption? Maybe you just hate the French with such an unreasonable passion that you want to invade them for nothing? Or becuase they are French? Have you ever hated freedoms and liberties?  Maybe you just want to crush the American Revolution and Tax the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of them for high quality tea? Ever wanted to sink a Spanish Armada just becuase its too Catholic for its own good? Or maybe, just maybe you want to demonstrate the beauty of gunpowder to the savages of the Americas? Maybe you want to murder a people in order to force them to grow you opium? Maybe you want to murder a people in order to force them to buy said opium? Either way the Chinese and Indians won't mind another Opium War...  At the end of the day, if you are a war mongering, tea drinking, bayonet using, people oppressing, gentleman of Her Majesty's finest of British Empires then this is probably a good game for you...  And if you like RTS's then this is a good choice... Worth every penny... every penny you made selling opium you sold to the Chinese...
3115	1	a	This game is far from perfect.  The worst thing is that you cannot save during battles, or during the opponents' turn. If various computer opponents attack you ten times between your turns, you never get to save, and unless you auto-resolve the battles, each battle may run 1-2 hours and you might have 10-20 hours of fighting before you can next save the game. For me, the game was very stable, but leaving it dominating my gaming computer for a week or more without being able to save did not feel good. Once you start to dominate, you rarely have to fear attack, and this type of long, drawn-out slug fest turn disappears, but until then, expect to leave the game running all the time... And you never get to save in mid-battle.  Saved games are huge on your HDD. Big enough that I stopped keeping my saves from the beginning and end of each turn, but started to recycle a group of 10 saves instead. Beginning and end of turn, and beginning and end of every battle. In a hundred turn game, they add up unless you recycle.  Ships. Nice to see ships, but the battle system felt really contrived. For example, the sailing ship fights give small ships a longer range than larger ships. That's the opposite of reality. Secondly, ships can only run away once per turn - again, that doesn't reflect reality, where small ships could run away from the big battlewagons each and every time they saw them, and only had to fear frigates. Then there's the whole: spin your ship like a top strategy. It just didn't work with big ships in reality. But it works in Empire. Spin one direction, fire. Spin the other direction, fire. And yet...it's fun to watch your ships batter the other side's ships to pieces.  Seiges. Are handled terribly. The computer just doesn't know how to attack a fort very well, or defend a fort very well. If you wait a couple of turns, a more sensibly managed battle takes place just outside the fort, but tying up your army for two turns anywhere is frustrating.  Setup. Even outside forts, the computer can give itself some utterly terrible opening setups - most terribly when it entrenches its artillery.  Armies. Armies start out tiny. Not simply poorly armed and trained: tiny and poorly armed and trained. Why?  Stacks. Are limited to 20 units. Battles are limited to 20 units PER COUNTRY. So if you have three stacks of twenty units, you only get to deploy 20 units at a time. Toughest and most satisfying battle I fought was against a stack of 20 French units, reinforced by 20 Spanish units and several French units. None of my units routed, despite fighting against 40 enemy units at once, and having one opponent's units (the French) getting reinforced by a fresh unit whenever a unit of theirs routed. Oh, normal difficulty - you're the best!  Government leaders. Are random and can have HUGE effects on your ability to wage war. It'd be nice to be able to disable that wildcard, 'cause mostly I enjoy the battles. And for that matter: it'd be nice to have a summary of the effects of all your government leaders.  All that bad, and still...watching my little men kill the little enemy men is fun. And so is taking over the world. I don't know why. About 100 hours at the keyboard for a grand campaign? I think I played three of 'em. Russia, Britain, Britain. Britain is by far the easiest.
1655	1	a	one of the best RTS's i have played
1633	1	a	My god, I have played this game more than I like to admit but it has all been worth it. Great period, HUGE campaign map, tons of political, technological, and strategic ways to map your conquest. While the vanilla version is good, it isn't great. Get one of the many mods that rebalance everything and make it more fun/innovative once you get bored.  Get it, mod it, love it.
3927	1	a	by far one of the best games i have ever played its good enough to make it onto my honorable mentions on my top 10 best games of all time the total war series was an amazing idea for games i have not played all the games though but i will play every single one the game is so amazing it feels like a true war it fullfills what ive wanted in a game just warfare in an older time it amazing its got decent graphics that are very easy to put up with and a descent story the games very addicting my final verdict will be 8/10
2923	1	a	Great Game
2388	1	a	Excellent game, I still play it and that with 300 hours on record!, relitively historicly accurate ( no not exactly haters, mostly I said ).   My personal suggestion ? , get this game play through vanila , then get ' darth mod ' and install this and run, its a little buggie but it allows 40 divisions on map! , this leads to some epic fights that can take a while to win yes, but it ' feels ' more like the battles should.   Navel combat = Excellent, having the HMS Victory put a broadside into a spanish war gallon and watching its powder keg ignite is impressive.   Buy , play and enjoy just make sure your computer is closer to the ' recommended ' then the ' minimum ' specifications.
492	1	a	this is a great tower defense game. good music, maps are quite challenging, many weapon (I missed the gunbow when moved to Orcs must die 2), traps ....and interesting winning pose.
2874	1	a	this game is really fun. lots of amazing graphics, i got over 200 hours on it so it will last a long time, if you like the board game risk you will love this, turn base/rt at its best
3719	1	a	This game is fun 
3416	1	a	very good even at year 2012 with a pop of 516 million and an income each turn of 4 million pounds
3910	1	a	I love this game go over 300 hours played. What i love is the graphics and the game play. I bought the historical units love them. What i hate is the AI it is oftem dumb and dosnt know what to do. I watch a unit of calvary run down 10 units of line infantry but never attack. Also during a sieg the AI never attack but with three units and they had three huge armies attacking. They could of won but i did with 8 units. Dont get me wrong this game is amazing. Warning you need a good computer and good graphics card. If you get that this game is unstoppable.
1555	1	a	This game is an absolute must have! Combining this game with great mods like Darth Mod or Minor Factions makes this game an incredible experience. This has got to be my favourite Total War game.
1137	1	a	uhh you kill orcs... funny ways... do it..... buy it.... now....  I am hobo and I approve this message
392	1	a	This game was the reason I came back to steam after four years of not using it. It's an absolute blast! It's a mix of Tower Defense and First Person Shooter with some good comedy thrown in. It's a must-play for any Tower Defense fans.
2975	1	a	The best TW game in my opinion. Why? - Awesome Naval combat - Global scale - My favourite period in history - Sikh Infantry rocks! - Nothing better than the sound and smoke of a 1000 muskets dropping the enemy's entire front line in 5 secs
4945	1	a	(edit- after finishing it) Brilliant space combat game made by two people. A balance between action and strategy, leaning a bit on the action side. Collect resources, crew, research data, blueprints for tech, and different ship hulls. My main critisisms are lack of variety in missions and crazy difficulty spikes in the last chapter. Best game I've played on steam in a long time, give the demo a shot!
2713	1	a	This game is great.  There is no other way to say it. It is fun, strategy, militaryistic game that has heaps of play time and potential. If you like the 1700's then you will love it. You can be heaps of different factions and it is pretty realistic. Great game. Absolutley love it.
619	1	a	fun and hard (sometimes) and addicting game, that i can't stop playing. my type of humor too.
62	1	a	Ok so this game represents everything wrong with society in my opinion, What the actual â¥â¥â¥â¥ is so bad about Orcs that we just need to keep killing them and killing them and killing them. Like I bet if we just treated them fairly they would be just really chilled out and help us out and â¥â¥â¥â¥ but noooo just because they are stronger than us (Insecurity much?) and have different colour skin (Racism much?) we have to spike them and shoot them and smash them up. Y'know what? â¥â¥â¥â¥ this. I wanna be an Orc.  10/10 would think I'm playing Sanctum again.
1441	1	a	Starts as Spain Bad choice Britain declares war Lose provence  Anex New Spain Rake in cash RIP Great Britain  10/10 would defy the laws of the universe again
1775	1	a	worth my time 
1879	1	a	Favorite total war in my opinion, and I have Rome 2 and Shogun 2 also. First of all, the game feels so smooth compared to the other total wars, especially if u dont have the best computer, and theres even a Road to Independence mode. The mode features the colonists in Jamestown the first chapter, and slowly progresses to the making of the declaration of Independence in the third chapter. Now to a few bad things, THIS GAME IS OLD so it does not have the BEST graphics and does not have more than 20 matches going on at a time in multiplayer. The AI is â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ (In all total war games) so they pretty much just all charge u at once unless u put the difficulty on expert. And in my opinion, the worst aspect of the game, THE TIME LIMIT! Grand Campaign and Road to Independence have a time limit, forcing you in the wonderfully brilliant campaign, to hurry up. OVERALL. the game is nice and fun, but does have a few problems which could easily be fixed, but wont be because the game is old.   P.S. idgaf about the grammar mistakes bruh because i dont  P.P.S. I know i didnt put a period at the end of my sentence there. That was to show i really dont GAF. P.P.P.S. or P.P.S.S. (I dont know) 10/10 IGN would free America again.
199	1	a	I want a present.

1509	1	a	-Released Brittania from France because I thought it would hurt them -Turns out they weren't greatful, and they started out with a mega army -France bribed them/seduced them -Brittania joins france in an alliance -I declare war on Brittania with my allies, then france joins, then italy. -I started the first world war.  10/10 would start a world war again
3671	1	a	Empire: Total War is a game including depth, action, and a healthy dose of enjoyability. Fans of the Total War series and the RTS genre will find much to enjoy in the turn-based main segment and real time battle segment. No longer do the towns of your nation become filled with a variety of buildings, nor do your armies become irredemably damaged with the loss of a single general. The streamlined processes of improving upon your existing constructions and leader recruitment ensure that you do not become overladen with construction projects or mourn the death of your only warlord. The number of agents needed to create a properly functioning nation have been reduced to an assassin/spy, religious figure, and researcher. However, these agents are recruited as before, but generated by buildings affiliated with them, such as entertainment structures, religious centers, and schools. The long awaited naval battle has been added, and, while not perfect, is as exhilirating and epic as a colonial era combat should be. Speaking of combat, the land battles can be titanic engagements with death, gunpowder, and screams galore. However, smaller conflictsd involving only a handful of units can move slowly and be a bore if not sped up. In addition, the early versions of Empire were riddled with bugs that ruined gameplay, specifically in land battles, but that have mostly been patched out. The diplomacy function, while enjoyable as each nations has expressly different goals, can be annoying as on easier funtions the rival nations can be push-overs while being unrepentant, unforgiving warmongers on harder functions. These issues make Medium difficulty the most appropriately functioning setting. Empire may not be a perfect game, and it does have some noticeable flaws even as most problems have been patched out, it still ranks as one of the greatest in the RTS genre, and as one of TW's finest creations. 9/10
3017	1	a	One of the best strategy games ever! The maps and the playability is out paralel, much action but mainly lots of thinking and lots of things to do in the campaign ap cenario. Worth it so much!
176	1	a	Blow off some steam and embark on a journey whose purpose is the total slaughter of orcs seeking a better homeland. Crush their dreams. 
1601	1	a	Man what to say about this game. It's another of this Total War series masterpiece... This game teached me to love Imperieal warfare era. It's a old game that I still play nowadays. Also it's sucessor Napoleon is a great game but this game offers some great mods and different timeline(playstyle). I recommend it a lot, and if you are taking a hate for CA about them being a DLC â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ it's your profit for buying and playing ther older games especially now they are cheap.  The only problem would be the not so great Campaign AI. But to fix that there are a lot of mods. I really recomend DarthMOD empire. Makes the game much more realistic/historical and really hard.  Overall 9/10
4696	1	a	I have to say, it does bring back some of what I've missed about older games. I give it a 'yay'. :)
5214	1	a	I got this on sale thinking I might get an afternoon out of it but I got so much more.   One thing I noticed, this game has an addiction factor much like the civilization games. Every mission you do makes you want to push on to see what's next, got to get that next ship or that next weapon.   GRAPHICS: are very detailed for a 2D game and throw out some nice effects, for example the explosions are pretty decent with bits being blasted off as you bring down a ship slowly, crew being sucked out of a breach in the hull and there are some rather nice backdrops with small details you can appreciate when you zoom in.   SOUND: isn't overbearing, there is an effect for everything but it just lacks a little punch for my tastes. I would have liked the weapons to sound a bit meatier, right now they sound like pings and pops. The explosions however do sound pretty good when you blow up something big. There is some interesting and funny radio chatter that will put a smile on your face.   MUSIC: very much suits a game of this type, it doesn't try to overshadow the sound effects or deafen you when you're in a firefight...which is almost always. It's the kind of music that sticks in your head when you're not playing the game.   Your currencies are well balanced and you never have too much, you will of course always run out but then there's always a way to make back the lost currency, unlike a lot of games where you have way too much money and nothing to spend it on, I really do hate that in a lot of games.   I'm blown away by how addicting this game is without feeling like it's a sugar rush. What I mean is that it won't give you all of the cool stuff in the first 5 minutes of the game and then you have to grind for another 50 hours without anything awesome to discover. No, this game is one of the best paced games I've ever played and the balance of leveling, tech points and weapon acquisition over the course of the entire game will give you the feeling that you ate the whole cake, not just a bunch of icing or just the cake without icing.....if you catch my drift.   At the time of this review, I've clocked 45 hours but I'm still having a blast, still have a lot to discover and upgrade but at the same time I kinda don't want to finish this game. You know something is good when you want it to go on. I just hope SPAZ 2 has that same feeling....
5043	1	a	Game rocks! I bought it for 2 bucks and put 50 hours in it. I love the different ships you can aquire and there's so many builds and ways to play! The is a blast to play and the controls are great. It's a really arcade-y feeling game but there's so much depths and upgrades to get (and the upgrades aren't just linear ones).
556	1	a	One of the most helarious tower defence games Iâve played. I do very much enjoy this genre and orcs must die does shine as one of the best. Even though the gore and the graphics design is 'cartoony'; mowing down the hord with well placed traps or jumping into the frey with a meele weapon is still extremely satisfying. The humor is well done but taylored for younger players with reasonably subtle hints to more adult subjects. The plot is simple but entertaining non the less. The maps can be quite fendish but once you work out the best arrangement it all falls into place and you can work on that high score.
4437	1	a	I am a big fan of the AOE series, and history. This game is brilliant, although the AI may be silly at times *cough, Napolean* it still has unique gameplay and good graphics, as well a Pretty decent uprgade system. I loved the fact that different units would take up a certain amount of population, e.g. A dragoon would take up 2 population where as the a musketeer would take up 1. There is a huge variety of map choices and with the Asian dynasties pack and The war cheifs DLC, the selection choices are endless, they vary from the Amazon River, The Andes, Anywhere in the US and even the Great silk road in Asia.   Best feature for me? The Expansion Packs were actually expansions that changed the game in multiple ways and added on to the complete/full base form of the game. normally DLC nowadays is required to get the full package of what the final product should've been. AoE3's Expansion Packs ARE NOT DLC. The Expansion Packs in AoE3 add on to the game content enough to make it feel like a different game within a game. The Expansion Packs aren't neccessary to fully enjoy Age of Empires III; however, having them improves upon the player experience greater.  If you enjoy real time strategy games, enjoy managing an economy, epic large battles, and don't like excessive micromanaging then this is the game for you. It offers brilliant combat with amazing scenery. The unit mapping is rather brilliant and the variety of maps keeps you constantly wanting to play more.
5331	1	a	Children play Call of Duty Boys play Battlefield  Men play ARMA
1746	1	a	Tried the demo and really liked it. Bought the game and am playing the hell out of it. Cant believe i missed this one for so long. Great Game!!
1940	1	a	Iv only had this game for a while now and i have to say its one of the best games iv played in years. I recommend you buy ASAP
48	1	a	This game helped me discover something important about myself. The fact that I apparently can never get tired of watching orcs die on traps.
4925	1	a	Spoilers in the title, guys. The third act Zombie reveal would have been better if we werent expecting it, but it did create a creeping sense of dread. Looking forward to future games by these guys.
339	1	a	Fantasic mix of tower defense and shooter.  Great humor and wonderful story. A must for strategy fans looks for something new.  Highly recommended.
5279	1	a	BUY. THIS. GAME. That is all.
3028	1	a	thats so cool game ever i have scene
2979	1	a	Truely epic.
1580	1	a	One of my favourite games of all time. Has an excellant campaign and units. A few small problems that arent really very noticeable and a load of mods. This game is fantastic and a must buy for anyone who likes military history, history, strategy games or the TW series. Excellant game and a job well done.
4264	1	a	This game has problems. Text is blurry and too small if you have a monitor that's 1600x900 or 1366x768, that is easily fixed with a mod though. The campaign map is laggy and stuttery on even NASA's computers. Again, easily fixed with a mod. There are a few little problems like this that will keep you from enjoying the game, but with 20 minutes worth of configuring can be solved. Once you fix the game properly it's completely amazing. The scale of this game is just outstanding. Playing as the Dutch means you start with provinces in Europe, India, and America. The battles are cool as hell too. Once you get the fire by rank ability you can really unleash your muskets and the ferocity of line battles comes to life. This game is a flawed gem but it's still better than Napoleon. Shogun 2 is better imo but if you are interested in Europen history or American history I'd pick this. Also Shogun focuses more on melee combat where this is more aimed at line battles with thousands of riflemen.
1806	1	a	Amazing game that definitely makes you think. Perfect for RTS fans
2363	1	a	This is the best total war game ive ever played
4583	1	a	This is a really enjoyable game. I good blend of Space and Pirates. I've yet to really encounter zombies though, so I can't say if they are in good measure or not.
846	1	a	very short, but sweet none the less  good balanced gameplay, strategy is used, but it could be expanded a lot
2189	1	a	the hardest game of the total war franchise followed by shogun and rome total war the game is so hard I never play the game because i get my â¥â¥â¥â¥ kicked by native americans which shows how hard this game is.
3788	1	a	This was probably the last time I still had expectations in the lead up to a TW game. Having played Rome, Shogun, Both Medieval games I was used to the TW style. I loved the time period and Sea battles, building fleets was so much fun and the Battles looked amazing. Overall a 7/10 game that provided a fair few good hours of gameplay for me. The last time I can remember that a TW game wasn't just a reskinned copy of a previous game (Napoleon) or a DLC dominated cash cow.  
1712	1	a	If only multiplayer campaigns.
4151	1	a	great game although the ai sucks and increasing the difficulty of the game just gives the ai buffs but thats why we have mods like darthmod and imperial destroyer. Plus I really like the era of the 18th century. I just love conquering cities and forcing the populace to convert to my state religion :D now i know what the spanish feel when they were forcing our ancestors to convert to Catholicism.The only thing that i do not like about the game is the fact that i get no response from host most of the time i try to play multiplayer but overall i recommend this game if you like muskets tricorne hats ships from the golden age of sail forcing your conquered subjects to convert to your religion and watching scientist and rakes kill each other in a duel to the death!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3464	1	a	Grand scale total war.............great game for sure
2432	1	a	IMHO, the best part of the Total War Series. No Warcraft-like Commander superpowers like in the prequels, and a nice economic system that hits the right point between simplicity and complexity. Highly addictive.
3321	1	a	2nd best TW game.  Nothing like watching an unorganized group of savages charge your line of disciplined minutemen.
2485	1	a	its an oldie but i got 707 hours locked in on it enough said
226	1	a	Killing orcs have never been this fun!  P.S. Also you can kill kobolds, gnols, ogres and other nasties.
2945	1	a	Great game!
1427	1	a	Awesome game. Although a rather late review. It is a great game with a nice number of bugs. :)
4137	1	a	it would be nice to be able to play the grand campain would be good
3009	1	a	Great dynamic and diverse strategy game. Like tactics, hundreds/thousands of units and epic battles? Then play this game!
3534	1	a	Still my favorite of all the Total War series. Grand Campaign alone is more fun to play than EUIV.
4673	1	a	Sweet game altogether! first game i accualy want to buy for once. found the cheats too which isn't too much of a cheat. hint hint hold alt f7
4298	1	a	  Grate game i only wish there were some mods i could use
4329	1	a	Great game! Very accurate historical events. Awesome gameplay and factions to use.
5209	1	a	Very interesting game to design your battle ship and fight humans or zombies. Collecting componets and looking for the favorate combination in battle are always addictive.
2398	1	a	Amazing game-I'd give it 5 stars. Tons of choices, Naval, Land, realistic Scenarios, and a sweet Campaign. Awesome graphics, nice attention to detail, from the wood on the fences, the muskets, the soldiers' uniforms, the grass, truly epic. I would reccomend this game to anyone who likes strategy and historic events/military. Best game on the market for military and strategy nerds, i would say.
119	1	a	Good game! It can get challenging and have you truly under pressure but good strategy and using some basic evil intuition will have you mulching orcs into a pleasant and nutritional sauce! Bathe in that stuff youngster... it'll keep you sharp and youthful inside long past the point where hope and happiness fades into a bitter diy tincture that doesn't heal the wound that won't close... yes.... a most excellent orc genocide simulator! Bonus creatures included for happy end!! and it had a very good sequel also! :D
3514	1	a	Really cool Large-Scale rts. The 'controlled chaos' that this game introduces is CRAZY. Beware, however, this game is not for the new rts player. 7/10
3931	1	a	Not even the best line infantry can stop the charge of sikh warriors and war elephants. Steamrolled my way through India, the mid east, Russia and Purssia. Maratha supremacy mutha fukas.
3783	1	a	It's an incredible game, with fantastic gameplay.
1040	1	a	What a great twist on the tower defense genre. This game will have you killin orcs for hours
4999	1	a	Tried this on the Free-Weekend-Thing. After two hours into the game I can say that it is worth 2 Bucks.  + easy too navigate and organise your fleet + lots of ships and stuff to upgrade + decent amount of tactical stuff to concider + good interface + non hectic, more or less relaxing gameplay  - repetitiv - boring 'story' (havent seen any zombies yet, maybe there will be smth like a story?) - the npcs all have pretty ugly faces  But yeah, if you see this game for sale grab it. The Metascore of 73 or what it is is pretty accurate. It is not a bad game!
2086	1	a	-Starts up game -Awesome intro, game looks appealing -Selects Grand Campaign -Selects United Provinces, because I see a lot of potential in them -Starts off constructing buildings in Amsterdam -Suddenly out of nowhere, Spain declares war on me -â¥â¥â¥â¥ -Emasses a 1200 man army in Netherlands, and a 400 man army in Gutch Guyana -Decicively defeats the Spanish at Amsterdam, Cuba and Brussels -Signs a peace treaty with Spanish, annexing Brussels and Cuba, all seems g -Frace declares war -.... -Sends army to Paris and quickly defeats them, annexing Alsace-Lorraine, and gives Paris to Great Britain -Bavaria, Wurrtemburg Hannover and Westphalia declare war on me -Im starting to get the hang of this -Annexes Wurrtemburg, Hannover and Westphalia and gives Bavaria to Prussia -Poland, Russia and Courland form a coalition against me -Great Britain and Prussia come to my aid, yey -Loses to the Polish at Konigsberg, but wins after -Poland declares war on Austria and fully annexes Austria -I invade the Austrian provinces -After that, I invade Warsaw and Vilnius -Poland is destroyed -To make peace with Russia, I give Lithuania, Minsk and all of Polands eastern provinces to them gives the rest of my captured provinces to Prussia -And I live a happily ever after....   -BUT WAIT -Guess who's back? Back again? Spain is back, tell a friend! -Spain invades France and Cuba and captures them -They enter my territory and I halt them a Brussels -I defeat them at Paris and win at Madrid and Cuba -I annex the rest of Spains colonial empire and give Madrid to Great Britain -The year is 1749 -Whelp, gg  11/10 bruv
4141	1	a	Blockaded one port in the Netherlands. I put them in national dept.    9/11 Would (Insert funny phrase here) again.
1979	1	a	Empire: Total War had a really shaky launch plagued by horrendous load times and lots of bugs. Now that most of those have been sorted out, it's a solid entry into the Total War franchise that keeps the deep strategic goodness of the previous games while trying new things (eg. research, lots of minor nations, etc.). Some of it succeeds and some fails, but ultimately E:TW is worth grabbing for fans of the franchise. It seems easier than the games that came before it however, so fair warning there.
1269	1	a	I truely can't understand how I'm so addicted to this...
2769	1	a	A great game to play if your into U.S history and how the U.S gained there independece. Its really good on graphics and its online gameplay
1348	1	a	Great game, classic. Better if you add Darthmod.
127	1	a	Love this game! :D Got it for my B-day years ago.
2406	1	a	Major Defeat 111/10
771	1	a	There are these orcs. They must die. ALL OF THEM.  This game owns. (also I wrote this recommendation so I'd get a steam gift thingie achievement)
538	1	a	Pretty Cool Tower Defence! Its a little bit challenging i love that!Can't wait to try Orcs Must Die 2 :D
4081	1	a	This is where they began the trend of disappointing oversimplification of regions... But before it gripped them too tightly. As a result you have massive, sprawling Imperial conflicts over three continents with beautiful infantry forces, slightly anemic artillery and... I think there were some horses around too... The AI is as ever, ropy and the path finding needs a slap but there's a tech tree this time and they 'fixed' the bug that made England invincible the first few months. Ahhh, who cares - just get it, load it up and march on Paris, you know you want to! 
4515	1	a	SPAZ is a fantastic example of a game that nither takes itself seriously nor cares what you think. Its a fantastic and fun SCI Fi Cyber punk game with a grat sountrack and tons of humor. If you want something to play all the way through or just to flip on when you are bored, then SPAZ is definitely a great choice.
2672	1	a	One of the best if not the best strategy game ive ever played. Complete control over all game aspects terrain range accuracy. it is very realistic and also historiclly correct. one of my favorite games so far
2588	1	a	Very enjoyable still think its the best Total War so far
468	1	a	Challanging game! but a really nice tower defense!!! RECOMMENDE!!!
1691	1	a	Great game *IF* you have Darthmod, as Darthmod turns this game into a great game with intelligent ai, realistic sounds/ effects, realistic unit ranges etc; however, if one does not wish to bother with mods at all, then i would skip this game and move to a diffrent total war title.
1663	1	a	Beast game to play with friends and its all so very fun to play by yourself but i reccomend that you get all the DLC's for the best possible game
430	1	a	Great game. Addictive tower defense style-game with a decent amount of variation between weapons, towers, maps, and mobs. Recommend for any tower defense lover.
1586	1	a	Empire: TW &gt; All other Total War games Empire: TW &gt; All Civ games Empire: TW &gt; Every other game It's fun
3231	1	a	As someone who has logged 350+ HOURS into Empire Total War, I can safely say that this is is one of the most enjoyable and strategic of the Total War franchise. If you have any interest in strategy games or history, pick this up. Seriously.
4613	1	a	All altogether billiant mix of fleet tactics and trigger-happy WASD action that will leave you wondering where this game was for the last 10 years. SPAZ evokes nostoligic memories of Solar Winds and Star Control -- games from a simpler time, but adapts with beatiful graphics, fast and liquid gameplay, and well-placed rpg elements. With a name that includes the word Zombies, I passed on the game originally, but it's quietly short-listed its way into my heart, and onto my top 5 indie games of the year.
2856	1	a	&gt;Plays as United States. &gt;Forms NATO in 1840s with European nations. &gt;Fights Ottomans, and African powers for WMDs &gt;Russia invades the crippled Ottomans, and begins skirmishes with NATO  &gt;Tfw I accidentally begun the Cold war a hundred years earlier than intended.
3763	1	a	The Cockney badger approves
2865	1	a	Most people say Empire was the worst total war made. I highly disagree and believe it has its potential to enjoy if you like the series. (best naval battles of any total war)  Singleplayer 8/10 Multiplayer 5/10
2390	1	a	Suprising that this game is a little similiar to Napoleon Total War but this game is so much better and more fun. I was looking for this type of total war for awhile and I love this game so much. Better than Napoleon in many ways
4448	1	a	Do you like video games? Do you like RTSs? Do you like not having to have 300 apm to keep a constant stream of resources coming in? Then you will like AoE 3. If you don't go hardcore or of Asian descent and play strategy games like a casual (like me) then you will also like this game. What I mean is that the macro from Age of Empires II was VERY watered down in AoE 3. Sure you still need some form of it like all RTSs, but the amount has dropped very much so. And I LOVE gunpowder units. Nothing is more satisfying then seeing 100+ musketiers poppin caps in each other like this is Chicago.   The addition of Home City shipments is another feature that I like. Basically you choose around 20 shipments (they are cards that you put into a deck and you pick new cards everytime you level your home city) gain experience from various actions and once you accumulate enough you gain the ability to call in a shipment to your town center. Cards are also Age related and most can only be used once. The cards can range from calling in military units, villagers, economic shipments and buildings, and upgrades for many different things. And some cards affect all your allies. There is a lot of different strats you can go with a deck.  As I mentioned earlier you have Home Cities for each civ. Basically when you first start the game you choose which Civilization you want to be, then you choose your home city name and your explorer name ( you can put any name you want for both, great feature ) then you go into a game. You gain exp as you finish games, gaining levels for your city. Then you can unlock new cards. Some cards are locked until later levels ( it goes something like 10&gt;25&gt;40 I think) but from what I have since they aren't that much better, still useful though. If you want to play a different civ you have to make another home city for them and can also name that anything you want, along with the explorer, starting back at level one ( Unless you play the DLC, for some odd reason you start at level 10 with 10 unlocks. So just play the Asian DLC since it has everything for the other one and the base game.) Each Civ has different cards available at the start and to unlock although about half are universal.  Onto the gameplay it is mostly the same as AoE 2. With the addition of Trade Routes and Native camps (which supply extra resources and unlocks special respectively) it adds some degree of map control. There probably was already map control on AoE 2 but I know little of how the meta is for it. If there was I'm sure trade routes and native camps add even more since the extra resources are a huge bonus ( They start off giving only Exp and can be upgrade 3 times with the last being a train, another feature I like. And the free exp is HUGE to getting early home shipment points) and natives can harass early on. Natives also don't add to pop limit but you can only train a certain amount. Having more than half of all the trade posts and native camps gives you the option to start a Trade monopoly victory, which gives you victory in 5 minutes if they don't destroy any trade posts/native camps, helps if the enemy is turtling hard. You also can only build one castle and thats from a shipment you get (Russians can build more I believe). And if the wagon it starts off as gets destory you don't get another. Stone was also removed as a resource. Also, cannons and muskets. Pretty much the two man things you will build, or at least for me. Still plenty of archers, cavalry, swordmen, pikemen, etc. A lot of civs have more than one special unit, and they aren't built from the castle only. The population cap is set at 200 and that has mixed feelings but I'm fine with it. The graphics are great even though I run it on low. Haven't played the campaign nor the multiplayer, just skirmishs.  Overall, a great game and a must buy for any RTS fan. Even if it is slightly watered down from AoE 2 the new additions to it and time setting are amazing, great gameplay, and good graphics.  40 dollars though? Damn, definitely worth at at any sales price, but who even buys triple A games over 30? Still worth it at 40.
3792	1	a	Possibly my favorite video game of all time. Insanely addicting if you like historical types of games.
5273	1	a	Seems grindy at first but it's pretty addictive and you don't mind playing missions over and over to advance and explore its universe. I suppose it will get repetitve eventually but it's been a lot of fun so far...
866	1	a	Fun, quirky tower defense game that is simple to pick up, and allows you to defend your castle the way you want to. With all of the DLC(new weapons/traps), you are given a wide array of weapons and traps to set up to help you kill invading orcs. Just take a look around your map, learn the path the orcs are going to be taking to get to your Rift(the 'main base' you're trying to protect, if you will), pick your arsenal for the map, and let it begin! Each Rift will allow only a certain number of orcs to be let through, but let any more than the maximum run through it and it's game over. Campaign lasts a good 7-11 hours depending on how fast you play and how good you become at the game, and then the rest is just playing the game because it is a fun way to pass the time. Recommended for those who enjoy strategical games.
4694	1	a	Great game, wish it was multiplayer. Picked this up in Humble Bundle (bought the bundle just for this) and was extremely pleased.   It's 2D top down. Zombies, pirates, and upgradeable space ships. Pretty neat concep and story line. Love the developers.   This game isn't for everyone, but there is no reason to hate on it. It's not the longest game ever, it does get repetitive in the end game.   I wish they had a version for Android. This game can run on really low spec systems and reminds me a lot of the first stages of Spore. It's a great simple game to have on the go that you can casually play and log off at a moments notice.
5065	1	a	It's a really good game! A little repetitive if you want to get everything, but that's true in many games.
3787	1	a	Amazing game, very close to the first Rome as my favourite TW game.
1872	1	a	It was crap when it came out, but after darth mod, game was perfect!
4394	1	a	By far the best of the Total War Series. Ambitious, beautiful and almost limitless replayability. A solid game and I wish the ones which came after it were at the scale of this one.
3091	1	a	This for those who are intro making their history. Also GUNS!
4007	1	a	After playing a decent amount of Shogun2 I've only recently been encouraged to go to E: TW and played some early games on vanilla, but was initially pointed to the DarthMod so that's where I went and have to say it's all that and a bag of chips so far. I expect many more hours to come...
1175	1	a	Despite all the drawbacks starting right from the beginning, the Reincarnation is a solid version of the game; I played to the very end and could enjoy it a lot. With more natural enemies, some new magic animation, graphical twitches and other new features in the game, it's only pity that due to bankruptcy the add-on with Mounting Clans was cancelled. Yes, it's not the original D1-2 style kind of game, combat particularly, probably they intended to get more HOMM-mish gameplay but still a very descent game after all. I can definitely recommend it, especially if you like this series.
4862	1	a	Fun retro space mining-shooting-something-something. It reminds me of the classic Starscape, but done even better. Very highly recommended!
2935	1	a	I was testing out one of the Native American factions in a custom battle and was totes stomping and had a buncha guys left vs a british cannon unit,  but once the cannon started firing all of my Iroquois got scared by it and started routing and I lost. :(
2404	1	a	Austria colonizing india, Ottomans Colonizing America, Indian tribes defeating my 2000 british army, 3rd turn USA formed, Polans annexes Russia, France conquering London. 10/10 would replay again.
4260	1	a	Let there be War!
3299	1	a	I spent 80 years colonising the Americas to get the rescources to go fighting in Europe. After 100 years i had the whole of America including portions of South America and the West Indies. I didnt send a single ship to India and the far east.  Massive, excellent game.
645	1	a	Think of a tower defence game with a controlable hero. Now replace towers with 100 other cool ways to kill an orc. (like a bladed vacuum that tears fools to shreds) Boom there ya go.  No real story, but that's not really the aim of the game. Just kill â¥â¥â¥â¥.
1886	1	a	The British army was weak. It's last city still standing.   I Decided to only put 1 General Unit to battle.    I won.
4198	1	a	Damn I love this game.
1820	1	a	This game is so epic.
3155	1	a	Great turned based and real time strategy game. Easily my favorite of the Total War series. Its not without its issues, no game is, but nothing is insurmountable to ruin the game.  Great gameply, great time period, and great battles (naval warfare is awesome). Excellent game.
3182	1	a	745 Hours in four years. it speaks fot itself.
5025	1	a	A game that is poorly named and very well put together for being done by a 2-man team.
4133	1	a	Don't play this without Darthmod.  Excellent game with most of the world at your disposal.
1709	1	a	Although I am not incrediably far in the game yet, I really like the game so far. It's very fun to play battles that you create personally or the campaign. It's got a lot of good content and great gameplay overall. I would reccomend this to anyone.
1831	1	a	big epic battles this is what i love about total war
1766	1	a	I love the total war series! I am not really interested in the campaign for this game. I soley bought this game to play instan action for the USA during the revolutionary war era and i was not disappointed i am a big fan of RTS games and i enjoyed this game.   9/10
3190	1	a	Great game if you're into imperialism and RTS'.
3224	0	a	Empire total war would have been a good game but the Ggame has too many bugs and is unable to work on windows 7 without crashing.   The general gameplay is good and graphics are well presented but the constant crashing once you have too many units and areas under your control make this game unplayable (that being cannot finish). This is well documented in many forums and the developers are very out of touch with their customer base but not fixing the errors correctly.  If you can pick this game up for 2-3 dollars then it will give you a good insight into total war games but be warned you will not finish a large game.  
5158	1	a	This game is BAWLIN' yo! Spaceships be pew pew like you never SEEN! I flew one and I was like 'WHAAAAAT!' Are you serious SPAZ?' Mean people in the police faction though. This one chick wouldn't even let me holla. I was like 'please you ugly anyway'.
3332	1	a	Good little game if you like to muck about abit and if you like a good turn based strategy game :)
5071	1	a	Still one of the best indies that I ever bought. End-game could have been better though.
32	1	a	I got this game for .99 cents when it was on sale, I thought it wouldn\'t be much fun but the opposite is true. This game is a surprising rendition of a classic TD but has a very unique element to it, You are the Character setting traps and slaying orcs with a crossbow. This game with all its unique trap combos, my favorite the Floor Burner with a spring trap to make them endlessly run through it again and again, makes the gameplay enjoyable, there are a few annoying maps but all in all a great game   Lets take a minute to go through the pros and cons  Pros- The game is surprisingly addictive slaughtering orcs over and over with a trap combo  The game has unique traps and different map levels each time so you don\'t get used to the same strategy  The headshot feature is my personal favorite   Archers on a bridge are OP  The Graphics are suprisingly great   Cons- The music for the orcs is a bit redundant but fun  I wish OGRES weren\'t so OP as well as the Fliers if you get caught offguard   Overview- I would recommend this game for someone who likes TD\'s and Strategy   PS. Or slaughtering orcs :D
184	1	a	This is one of the best and engaging Tower Defense games I have ever played. It mixes third person shooting and trap placing strategy so well it couldn't be done any better.  ÐÑÐµÐ½Ñ ÐºÑÑÑÐ°Ñ ÑÐ°ÑÑÑ Ð´Ð¸ÑÐµÐ½Ñ Ð¸Ð³ÑÐ°, ÑÐ½ÐµÑÐ³Ð¸ÑÐ½Ð°Ñ, Ð±ÑÑÑÑÐ°Ñ Ð¸ ÑÐ¾Ð²ÐµÑÑÐµÐ½Ð½Ð¾ Ð½ÐµÑÐºÑÑÐ½Ð°Ñ. Ð­ÑÐ° Ð¸Ð³ÑÐ° â ÑÐºÐ°Ð¹ÑÐ¸Ð¼ ÑÐ²Ð¾ÐµÐ³Ð¾ Ð¶Ð°Ð½ÑÐ°.
1222	1	a	Pretty good TD game
1353	1	a	The Total War series, who hasn't heard of it? As like all excellent Total War games I recommend you take the time to play and enjoy it in all of its glory. Compared to previous games this one has improved graphics, more complex and in depth micro management and introducing for the first time real time naval battles. What makes this game stand out from the other games in the franchise ( &amp; makes it more interesting) is that you have several major &amp; micro theatres of war. Since the games is set in the time of the 17th century gunpowder units &amp; cannons are a standard sight on the battlefield which may confuse older TW players since the main part of the battle isn't a big mellee charge with an onager or two onager to provide some support but here its all ranged and contains a lot of artillery supprt. The campaign is a little better than in the previous games because the enemy &amp; allied nations are no longer idly passive. The multyplayer has undergone a welcoming change and contains a ranking system &amp; achivements. One of the differences in the games is also that most nations units are the same and the differences between them are their stats, but this is no big problem. On the overall the game is a great step forward from the previous TW games &amp; I recommend this game to every strategy game enthusiast. In the case that I have forgoten to mention anything or the articlle was too subjective please inform me and I will correct it. Thank you.
874	1	a	A fun tower-defense/third-person-action game. The story is just a vehicle for funny voice overs and different maps, but the gameplay is great.
3196	1	a	A solid installment to the Total War series and worthy of the genre. Pick it up today and you will be glad that you did.
2512	1	a	I love this game, it's challenging, and the happiness system is cool. Now if only I had the patience to play through more than a handful of battles at once...
1197	1	a	Finally, the game Disciples 3 should have been from the start. The combat is much improved and not nearly as tedious. Four different factions and a large variety of branching unit paths offers lots of replayability. I have always enjoyed the unique art style of the Disciples series and this one doesn't dissapoint. Wonderfully epic music too.
868	1	a	If you enjoy tower defense, you should dive into this very interactive 3D mass murder, the feeling of having set up a heap of traps to the limit of an unstoppable force, is priceless.
1038	1	a	A masterpiece, must have !
2040	1	a	Age of Enlightenment is a perfect period of time for such a game. For 2009 graphics are just fantastic. Fans of both history and strategies will find this game very attractive. One of the best strategies ever created (IMHO) 10/10
2439	1	a	When I first bought this I was unsure as it was reviewed as a buggy mess. However, after patching this has become one of my favourites from the series.
221	1	a	A great Tower Defence + FPS, must have!
465	1	a	I did the happy dance when i first played this game. Do you wanna do the happy dance?
2122	1	a	Really awesome game! So addictive!
1076	1	a	Great game - exactly what I had hoped Dungeon Defeneders would be. Just the right weight of game for me - not too heavy/long, but not so light/simple that it isn't fun.
2241	0	a	This game looked so good, but it kept crashing. In the end i had to refund ;( sorry developers
3451	0	a	this is a pretty good game, but with all games it has its flaws. the unit controls for land battle are a little drepy. they had a good idea with the turn-based rts but did not pull it off right in my eyes. Another problem is the low resolution on the text in the game and with no way to adjust it i find it a little hard to read sometimes. If you were to ask me to rate this game on a scale of 1 to 10 i would give it a 5.
2142	1	a	It really good
3419	1	a	Heck of a game fun for all
1470	1	a	Empire is epic but not flawless. The Age of Sail is captured very well. The 'Encyclopedic' notes describe many everyday details of the time, and are written simply and to the point. Adapting to the tactics of the age is required -- trying to play Empire like Starcraft will result in defeat. Suffice to say that there were logical reasons why the armies of the day formed firing lines, and Empire made me understand them. There is a wide range of nations to choose from, and all require different approaches. Empire should be stable, but the AI suffers from mental instability, in battle and especially in the campaign map. Modding is practically a requirement, and I always mention Darthmod in that context.
2525	1	a	I can't stop playing this game. ...Please, help.
2601	1	a	I think it is a fun game you can be the united states and take over america you can be many old factions
144	1	a	It took me cce 8 hours to complete first run on standard (not low) difficulty. Game offers variety of traps to serve one's 'style' - are you a direct damage dealer, tricky tactician, do you like traps to do all the work or do you like being engaged in a fight? These and many more options are offered. The variety of monsters, their stregnth, number in comparison with your abilities, traps and magic is well balanced. There are points in game where player must be very flexible. When you finish game, you can start with all upgrades and traps unlocked from previous run and do campaign from scratch. There are tougher monsters coming in already at start. This is sad, because I would welcome ability to play new game already on highest. I am not going to play again. Not because I wouldnt enjoy it, but because I have no time and want to finish other games, too. In short - great chillout game.
637	1	a	Nothing beats watching the stupid greenskins fall into your traps of doom.
422	1	a	i hate tower defence games, but this game is amazing.  this is the best tower defence game ever made, hands down.  the goal is simple, keep enemies from getting from point a to point b. you use elements to help you do such, like place and remove all sorts of different traps that do all sorts of different things. use all sorts of different weapons and spells/magic.  if you have never played or seen this game before, buy it. YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!  i have over 1000+ games that i own and play...not to mention games ive owned in the past on consoles. this is by far in my top 3 favorites, maybe even number 1.  so even if you are like me, and hate tower defence games, give this a try.
4021	1	a	Despite many hating this game, and thinking its one of the worst in the series, I love this game. Its not flawless or perfect, but with mods like darthmod, you get to experience what it would have been like to fight in a massive line battle against the british in the revolutionary war. And if your not a fan of this time period how about the civil war or world war 1, because this game has big expansive mods for these too. In conclusion if you, like me, love this time period then this is a must buy, and to those who aren't fans of this time period at least give it a go.
3603	1	a	No matter how repetitive it may seem, the Creative Assembly never fail to amaze. 8/10
990	1	a	Great game, bizzaro but awesome mix of FPS and tower defense, definitely worth the sale price!
4034	1	a	Love this game throughly. Easily my favorite Total War game. Later games do have better diplomacy, however. It gets very annoying to see the same countries go to war every game, almost like it is scripted somewhere. However, it is hugely improved over Medieval II Total War. I wish also that the map was more broken down, for instance making Spain multiple regions. 9.75/10
3564	1	a	GET IT GUYS!!!
1390	1	a	Long Rule Brittania
4110	0	a	Would absolutely love to recommend but game-breaking bugs and terrible AI make this one not worth your time and/or money. I've had to quit numerous battles I've won because an enemy's routing unit gets stuck on an object and magically becomes invincible. Upon quitting, somehow I'm always met with the 'Defeat!' screen. Campaign map troop movements by the CPU can become confused, leaving turns for CPU factions taking 10+ minutes to complete (no joke), ultimately destroying the experience. Granted, the latter only seems to happen when you continue after completing a campaign's objectives, but what's the point of allowing the player go for complete global domination if it's unplayable? Sadly, these issues (and more) plague the game for many and were never addressed by the developer. I love Total War, and I want to love this iteration so badly. I just can't recommend a game you can't fully complete and that has broken AI in crucial areas. Darthmod is amazing but doesn't address everything. Guess I'm sticking with Medieval II for the time being.
5216	1	a	Probably the best 2-D shooter I've played. Good integration of upgrade system and resource management as well.
2199	0	a	The ai in this game acts so barbaric it's not even funny, at the end on my first or second turn multiple nations declare war on me for no reason whatsoever, managing money in this game is pretty tought to especially if your at war with multiple nations who delcare war on you for no reason.
4986	1	a	Loved Stard Control II? You will crave for SPAZ!
576	1	a	Great game for the price. I even picked it up on sale. It will give you a lot of game play IF you want to get all five skulls and the achievements. Get ready to be frustratied (unless you play on easy) However, the challenge is part of the game. Remember this is a short game but it's worth the low price.
4791	1	a	This game feels like Diablo in space with lasers and missiles! Very fun to play
1232	1	a	A good, neat and well presented little TD that has a nice, logical and familiar control layout (reminds me of Gemcraft to some degree). ****
4276	1	a	*2009* Oh hey, this looks interesting, i may play it for awhile, shouldn't be that time consuming.
2590	1	a	Awesome. Definetly reccommended
3397	1	a	This game is great, involving the history and so. I love it and the whole concept of it
4671	1	a	I wish I could play this with controller, it is a fun shooter and more
3650	1	a	Wonderfully crafted
3343	1	a	i dont feel like writing much but yeah its really cool!
3235	1	a	Let me start off by saying that I love this game. I've put quite a few hours into it and have yet to get bored. This title, like all of Creative Assembly's Total War titles, has HUGE replay value. Now that being said, I feel that with this game, CA has gone forward, yet at the same time gone backward in some respects. There were things that they could have done, could have added, that would have made this game perfect in my book.   The pros: Expanded map. Their biggest one yet. This map includes the Americas and South Asia (Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India), which is a huge plus for me. The bigger the map the better. I really enjoyed the fact that there are mini-towns littered around region capitals. It adds a new dynamic of urgency and believability to the campaign. I also love how there are a ton of factions littering the map. The new technology feature is great, as is the addition of surprise emergent factions. The new battle mechanics that involve new firearms and artillery is excellent, as are the new naval battles. Whats not to love about that? Also, I love the revolution feature and how the dynamics of political change can screw diplomatic relations up. Top notch stuff. One great feature is the ease of hiring generals. This time around I did not have to wait for the AI to spawn one for me.  The cons: I would have loved to play every faction, such as the Mughals, the minor powers like Venice and Persia, and even emergent ones like Punjab and Mexico. I felt a bit teased to be honest, but the problem is fixable by a mod (Empire: Total Factions). I also felt that the characters traits had decreased from what was seen in Rome and Medieval 2. Speaking of characters, generals and admirals can be recruited as easily as any infantry unit, but why not rakes and priests? I understand the rationale about not being able to purchase new gentlemen (because of the technology rates and all), but at least let me buy rakes to spread havoc around!   Overall, this is a very good game and I feel comfortable recommending it to anyone.
3295	1	a	A great exsample by the Creative Assembly with this 18th Century RTS For me I play it for Poland Lithuania
1583	1	a	 Alcohol Reference  Tobacco Reference  Blood-JK  Language-JK  Violence   Online Interactions Not Rated by the ESRB 
3096	1	a	This is easily the best RTS I have ever played. The depth of campaign strategy is easy to learn, but challenging at the same time. Battles are tactically pleasing to perform and rewarding when a major victory occurs. My only complaint is that in naval battles, the ships often sail in a very clunky fasion and sometimes sail strange routes when engaging. Other than that, this is a very engaging and rewarding game in the long run, and I cannot stress how much Empire belongs in the RTS lover's library 4.5/5
4963	1	a	Solid but basic game. Starts out fun and stays fun, although it can get tedious if played for too long at a time. The gameplay doesn't suit long sessions very well. The story is likewise basic but serves the game quite well.
2174	1	a	Pretty cool...anything you would expect from 18th century warfare I would recemmend getting 'Minor factions revenge' great mod. Darth mod sucks alot. If you want proof play it.
1014	1	a	This is the kind of game that you can find yourself losing hours to because it is just so much fun to watch the carnage! A great combination of FPS and tower defense strategy, with a sense of humor that is rare in most games. From the first voice-over, it doesn't take itself too seriously and rather enjoys the absurd action for what it is. 
4725	1	a	SPAZ is really well made. Seems like you can play it for a long long time. There is as always a lot to learn in a Space game like this, but the learning curve evens out quickly and the game shines after that. It's something akin to Master of Orion from back when the dinosaurs ruled the arcades, but then again it's a lot of things not similar at all. Even with a small production team they have been able to create quite the amount of content. I can't wait to see if it keeps up the surprises and if wether or not it scales well. Cheap game, big world to explore, many hours of fun, and the devs hope to upgrade the game with more goodies in the future. Thumbs up from me.
1629	1	a	Good game Ai is stupid which bugs me and needed more variety in nations and more historically accurate troops. 
628	1	a	Awesome Trap-Defense / Third Person Shooter. Excellent art, good balance. Lots of gameplay.
853	1	a	Great game. Makes a whole new meaning to tower defense.
2776	1	a	A Total War game focused on gunpowder based weaponry? Blasphemy!   So for the longest time, I held off from this game. When I finally got this game on sale, I realized how wrong I was. This game is just as amazing as every other Total War game out there and has its unique charms.   PS: This game has better ship battles than games about ship battles.  
3136	0	a	The only reason I'm not recommending this is because the font size is small, blurry and unreadable, and there's no way to fix it.
2910	1	a	This game is pretty fun although it does kind of get boring after awhile. The game is both a grand strategy game and RTS so you can control battles and also your nation to try to make it the best nation. The multiplayer is only battles and isn't as good as the grand campaign. Also there is a campaign called 'Road to Independence' which is about the revolutionary war in America and other wars which is cool and all but again, most time will be spent in the grand campaign. It is too bad that you can not play as other, smaller nations like Victoria 2 but it isn't really much of a problem because all the cool nations are playable. Overall, it's a good game and you should buy it if you like something like Civ V or something like it or something
395	1	a	co-op 1st person tower defense with a sense of humor, very well executed, does all it says on the tin, a great game
6	1	a	Orcs don't have to die, but they keep walking into my traps.
1263	1	a	This game is unmistakably a return to a time when video games were more raw, unfinished, and simple. That this game appears to have depth and complexity is itself an illusion. I can count on my fingers the number of new things you will encounter as you play through the levels. My first time, I went as low as level -40. I couldn't seem to figure it out and every time you die, you go down a level. But then I started over, and am currently stuck at around level 118. There is a room full of robots that shoot enough bullets to make a japanese top-down shooter choke, and so to get past it, I went 'inside' one of the enemies to try and disable it's weapons through giving it weaker powerups. Instead, now I am trapped inside of it by more crazy robots.  The way I got as far as I have was not actually through a whole lot of careful planning or picking the right items. Instead, I find that I progressed faster by running straight past or through things to the exit. Since when you die you automatically get one of your three 'power ups' replaced with about 6 life points, you can burn through those and get to the exit. But, having done this, I am now not strong enough to proceed.
4587	1	a	Well, I have always been a fan of space strategy and RPG games. This one seems to have elements of both. If you liked the first two Master of Onion games, you will probably like this as well.
3489	1	a	One of the best games in it's category, let alone it's time period. You may not find it completely original, but that's okay because it is extremely fun! And, as a plus, it's the only of it's kind as it takes place in 1700-1799.
727	1	a	More awesome than you could possibly imagine.  
1026	1	a	Orcs Must Die! is a real gem of an indie game. It offers a creative take on the tower defense genre with plenty of options to approach each challenge. The mixture of strategy and action game elements coupled with tight controls flow together very well, leaving you with one very satisfying experience. The game also has a good sense of dark humor that, while it may get repetitive at some points, has yet to come across as annoying.  All in all, I highly recommend this game. If you love the tower defense genre you shouldn't think twice about getting it. The game offers a great experience that is well worth the price and is still fun to play again and again.
345	1	a	I originally only got this for the Steam winter holiday achievement, but this game is one of the most original and clever I've seen in a while. It's pretty simple, but sometimes, that's just fine.
876	1	a	Awesome, fun, simple yet strategic. Fast action. Great game!
3811	1	a	Your World Domination simulator
4187	1	a	one of the greatest stratiegy games i ever played 2 out of the top 5
3331	1	a	Beast campaign ever! It was so mind blowing! I toke over the whole entire world as Austria, i often found myself at school thinking over strategies while in class.
3051	1	a	This was my favourite total war game so far. not played warhammer TW yet though. I liked having all the different buildings in your regions, so not so keen on the dumbing down ive noticed in the newer games. Also the time period was a great setting for this kind of game. all in all loved the game. they got soooo much right here its easier to just say what went wrong. Mainly the downside of this game is all about the AI.  In campaign the AI can be a bit dumb. make some very strange choices, and the diplomacy is just crazy. ' yea i declared war on you and sent massive army that you wiped out. but if you give us some of your regions from your victory conditions we will make peace with you. how about it?'....um let me think.....no, i dont think i will.... not this turn. or next turn. or every turn till i wipe you off the game.  In combat the AI can actually be ok. unless its a siege. if defending the AI can be easily outwitted. and enemy troops can be moved away from key areas too easily with units which are no threat to a fort. and once you breach the walls even the most top end pc is going to be down to time passing at half speed as the AI tries to figure out what to do with certain troops.  In Naval battles the AI can also be a bit skewed. i've yet to find a fleet i couldn't destroy or seriously damage with 1 Brig. Get close and fire at the closest riggings ships while running away. your generally faster to start with and once thier sails are gone you can go in for the kill. the AI just cant del with this.  But i loved pretty much everything else about the game. so can highly recomend.
2	1	a	Fun game which offers a fresh take on the tower-defense genre. By putting you in the middle of the fray there is never a dull moment. The monsters are fun, the traps are fun, the character is fun and the gameplay is challenging and (wait for it) fun. What more could you expect? If you catch this game during a steam-sale you should definately give it a try.
1142	1	a	Fantastic Gameplay with great tactical elements, a tower defense masterpiece without the towers, where the sole objective is to use the myrid arsenal of traps and weapons to stop waves of half brained, one liner spouting Orcs.  
3038	1	a	This game was AWFUL on release. And I do mean AWFUL. Buggy as all hell, confused as to what it wanted to be, buggy, bland music, did I mention it had a TON of bugs?  Having said that, time, and mods, have been kind to this title.  Patches mostly fixed the nightmarish buggy mess that was, and made a platform that is relatively stable. Yes, I say relatively because you will still find the occasional hangup or outright crash.  Modding is what elevates this game to something that deserves playing even today. So many mods, of very high quality, that turn this into a very enjoyable experience.  Wait for a 75% discount and buy it.
1309	1	a	Very good game.  -Extremely historically accurate -Best campiagn (in my opinion) of the TW series -Very cool and realistic battles -Very fun  A really cool game for all strategy game lovers or historians. Even if this game doesn't necesarilly appeal to you, check out the other TW games, they are all great fun.
746	1	a	This game is a blast, fun form the get go.. and it only gets better. Its tower deffence on setroids. Bored with those 2D tower deffence games, then give this a try..
5077	1	a	This game is fun. You like fun.
1430	1	a	This is a great entry into the total war franchise.  - - - - pros  - very balanced  - good unit variety - deep strategic possibility s  - easy to learn hard to master  - - - - cons  -very rock paper scissors when you go unit to unit  - laggy online  - no longer has a bustling player base  - units moral seems really fragile   - - - -wishes  - steam mod support   This game takes place in the colonial era. So guns play a rather large role in this, and because of the era the guns are mostly single shot muzzle loaders. There are also melee infantry, hoursemen (both armed with fire arms and melee weapons) , and artillery of varying caliber.   Landscape is very important in this game because of the surplus of ranged units. Hight as in most games will help your ranged units and slow the advance of melee infantry. Artillery is also helped by being put on hills and the like.  In all honesty melee is not as important in this game as in others. But melee troops are still very useful. Because most units are ranged a melee unit can very quickly destroy their moral or the unit in general. But this goes the same both ways because of the ranged unit being well ranged. So melee are best for ambushes or holding walls.  One of the cons i mentioned above is that moral seems really fragile. Units can brake in a mater of SECONDS. This would be ok if it was mere cannon fodder but even the most elite of units can be broken after one or two volleys of fire then at other times they charge though no problem. The moral system seems unstable and inconstant. -1 point   As mentioned above all the factions are relatively balance because they share alot of units with small changes. The only faction that is at both a disadvantage and an advantage is the Indian nations. Because they are over all more stealthy they are good for ambushes, they also have better melee units from the start of the game, but their range is a lot lower then the European nations.  The online is very laggy if more then two players are involved. This is rather common in total war games. So unless playing 1 on 1 online or playing though LAN i would recommend not putting your hopes into online -.5 points A small complaint i also have is the lack of online campaign. Many other total war games both before and after have this feature.  As mentioned above the unit to unit comparison is very rock paper scissors. But many strategy games are like this and with proper strategy and high ground advantage it can be changed. so because you can counter it I think it evens out. so over all i think it is a 8.5/10
4923	1	a	Oddly immersive.
5122	1	a	great job to the developers. if you like a little bit of action, a little bit of harvesting, space travel, upgrading ships and weapons systems, trading with random encounters in space, and a well thought-out game with nice visuals, this is for you. the price is very fair for what you get and i would recommend it to anybody wanting some casual and progressive space fun. havent gotten to the zombies yet though :) definitely recommended
3297	1	a	This game has taken over my life at times.
3621	1	a	best total war game yet
4983	1	a	This game is very time consuming, but actually pretty good at the same time. Bad combination.
138	1	a	Not as good as Orcs Must Die 2! But still a really good game overall :)
4650	1	a	Very reminiscent of the old EV games and appeals to my OCD.
4519	1	a	Amazing game. Nice graphics, tight controls, even the story is pretty good. But the best part, it's a carrier-full of fun!  It's not all perfect, balance seems a bit wacky. Some weapon systems do not seem to be as good as others (cannons are amazing, drones not so much for example). But it's still a lot of fun. Definitely recommended if you like like space games, but get motion sickness with 3D games (I do). So this is perfect for me.  The devs did a really good job with this. Amazing what 2 people can accomplish.
5293	1	a	Great blend of 2D arcadey-sandbox action and RPG space shooter
950	1	a	The mechanics for this game are truly brilliant. Animation, interface, sounds, visuals, balancing of weapons...not a whole lot of thinking for the user, but enough to be satisfying. Kudos to the developers for creating something pleasing to both the thinking man and the non-thinking man, and every man in between.
1774	1	a	Brilliant addition to the total wars series. I like the tech tree which flows with this era, naval combat that was added and the most important classic total war land battles... awesome!
3146	1	a	Absolutely freaking love it.
3214	1	a	I'm not actually sure if i should click the button for 'I dont recommend this game'. Because I'm conficted, the first time i saw this game was at a friends house, he got a huge bundle with all the DLCs on Origin, a less popular version of steam. I always tell him that everyones gonna go to valve with the major titles but that's beside the point. For the fisrt month or so it was really interesting! I approached it like civilization V and failed miserably. Yes its a stratagy game, but its more battle stratagy than interacting with other nations to allie with you. So if you enjoy stratigising and commanding little men then go wild with this! But I got bored with it after a while so if your like me, dont buy it. Buy Toribash!
4555	1	a	Very very fun and so much to do. I also really like the simple but nice looking graphics.
4446	1	a	Looking for 3 more people to play with tonight. I will buy you the game. Already got 5 people. Great game
1358	1	a	Started a campaign as Venice, made a big fleet, rekt the Barbary states, blocked all trading ports of the Ottomans, Captured the Balkan, made Venetian colonies in America and India, took revenge on my rival Genoa and recaptured Constantinople for christianity with a small army.  10/10 would remove kebab again.
1727	1	a	$3.75 was a steal !!buy it now or regret !!
553	1	a	The best game where you play a Bruce Campbellian jockhead wizard hero and fight orcs in a 3rd person shooter tower defense game.
3972	1	a	Great Game 
1204	1	a	Fantastic! I was a huge fan of Disciples 2 and I'm havin' just as much fun with this.I highly recommend it if your into turn based stratagy/RPG games.
3082	1	a	Amazing game with loads of replayability...if only destroying walls in forts against the ai didn't cause so much lag.
4444	1	a	This game is:  10% luck 20% skill  15% concentrated power of will 5% pleasure 50% pain 100% reason to purchase this game
5035	1	a	Best top-down game since GTA2. Can't wait for the sequel. 10/10 That GOTY 2011 award is legit
862	1	a	Get this game. It's got a great art style, cartoony - but not excessively so, bloody - but not excessively so, and fun - excessively so (sic).   The DLC is worth every cent as well, the few new traps and spells are great fun, and the new missions are challenging as heck. Turn it up to Nightmare for additional fun and frustration.   This game makes me feel like the defense of Helms Deep, every single mission. It's you against hundreds, thousands of orcs. Cannot recommend this game enough.
488	1	a	This is a great game and I am really enjoying playing it. It's basically a FPS &amp; Tower Defense game. Your job is to prevent the orcs from reaching the rift. If too many do, you lose the level.  The orcs come at you in 'waves' and you have different ways of defending yourself. From traps to extra support (guardians). The key to success in the game is choosing the right traps in the level as well as placing them strategically.   
5094	1	a	This is a highly addictive game and certainly original. Why is it only indie developers can make decent games these days while corporations like EA Games and Activision simply recycle all their â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t into some half-â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ attempt at a pathetic game?  Case and point: Command &amp; Conquer 4, and Modern Warfare 2/3 whatever.
4092	1	a	great game once you get used to it!
1206	0	a	I like this game but I totally hate the orrible reduced movement range in battle and the reduced shooting range for archers and mage characters. This totally let me down, I wouldn't reccomend this to anyone. Waste of money for me. This is my PERSONAL opinion.
2317	1	a	If they didn't half â¥â¥â¥ this game it would be the greatest total war. Darthmod makes it great but still with its issues. Size and scope of the game does not compare to the other Total Wars. Empire should've had most of the mechanics from shogun 2 fall of the samurai.
2152	1	a	I'm surprised I've held off on saying something about this game for so long.  I don't really know what to say. Empire: Total War is just awesome. I still keep coming back to it, and I refer to it a lot as one of my favourite strategy games of all time. People like Civ 5, I like Empire. I mean, don't get me wrong, Civ 5 is not bad. You can play it with friends, too, and on top of that it never really crashes.  Empire, on the other hand, has rather deep combat. Or at least, deeper than just saying, 'hey, you, hit this thing' and then watching that thing hit that other thing.  I really enjoy the fact that quality can win over quantity. And I like the fact that you can play as Prussia. And I like the fact that this is a very, very interesting game - right clicking on any unit in the game, or even pretty much any building in the game will tell you it's in-game function, a brief history, and then possible some other interesting trivia about it, in that order, every time. And I love this. It's fascinating to learn about the 1700s while playing a game.  I just have a lot of fun in this game taking over the world as various factions. There's also some great mods for this game, and Empire, in my opinion, marks the last game before Creative Assembly really started to go downhill... Shogun 2 was pretty alright though.
4348	1	a	IK you are probably thinking do i get Napoleon TW or Empire TW. I come to help you comrade. I like them both, but they are different. If you like single player better then I'd prefer Empire because you can go to india and the americas. Napoleon TW only has the Europe theater and i personnally feel that the single player is lacking what Empire had. For mulityplayer, definitley get Napoleon TW. All in all i prefer Empire Total war, but thats just a bears opinion.
5262	1	a	This game boasts some serious action, requiring skill and speed to take down the enemy. It is well worth the $$$
5261	1	a	A procedurally generated space dogfighting game with a little bit of RTS micromanagement thrown in. While the story isn't the most in-depth you'll run across, SPAZ has enough content generated every time you load up a new universe to keep you on your toes every single playthrough.
81	1	a	This game is amaizing! Worth every penny! Can't wait for more DLC's to come out.
487	1	a	I bought the franchise pack and debated starting with the 2nd game or the first. I decided to start with the 1st one. I love it, I found my self thinking about different strategies at work even :) I like to use different strategies all the time, so I never just stick to one. It is easy to beat this game using only 1 type of strategy but the fun lies in tinkering about.  Stability: 8/10 - can hang for extended periods of time during loading screens Art: 9/10 - Suits the atmosphere of the game and is consistent through out Sound: 8/10 - Fits the mood the game tries to portray. Fire crossbow sound get's messed up if you strafe shoot. Gameplay: 9.5/10 - fluid and responsive, a joy to play. One downside is that orc attacks will hit you even if you are out side their attack animation. Story: 4/10 - interesting potential but is very sparse and lacks any detail Replayability: 9/10 - I love going back to get higher combo's and 5 skulls  If, like me, you bought both games, start with the first 1, it's extremely fun and the story does carry over to the 2nd game
4398	1	a	This game is truely epic. You have the ability to rule three theatres of war and four trade areas as well. You move through the builing and governing of an empire. It is one of the best in the Total War series which is saying a great deal!
3415	1	a	Certainly very engaging as the naval battles are very exciting and global conflicts in Europe, North Africa, India, Middle-East and America certainly give you the sense when creating your own empire. Ground combat is very tactical, detailed and by far the best Total War game out there with Rome Total War happilly in 2nd place.
4796	1	a	Crazy good indie game. Closest thing like it that Iâve played is Homeworld.
726	1	a	Insanely fun game to play! All I can really say is that ORCS MUST DIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4118	1	a	I like the historical content of this game 
1382	1	a	Excellent game with unlimited re-playability. Graphics are very good. Technological advances make a huge difference. Real time battles are easy to control and strategy oriented as opposed to a huge brawl. Naval battles are good as well as important cosidering the florins to be made by controlling the trade routes. Three continents to conquer as well as the trade areas offers a huge world. Downside is AI is still not too bright but it can still beat you if you push into enemy territory too deep ,too fast.AI is not totally incompetent though, build up an area and leave it unprotected and someone may decide to invade no matter how far behind the lines, enjoying your previous money making territory as their own.Yes, seaborne invasions of England do occur .Over 1200 hours and still enjoy this game .Maybe i just enjoy the warfare of this era .Never trust the Maratha Confederacy.
5058	1	a	Why don't you already own this? Get it now!
1621	1	a	GET IT, be sure to get darthmod with it.
4608	1	a	I really enjoy this game a whole bunch. It's lik Escape Velocity without the trading. If you find trading tedious, this is a great game. Just finding things and making money without dieing too much. It's just fun to play. A pleasure to move the ship around, I mean. The upgrading and items are all very nice as well.
3259	1	a	Fan of risk? diplomacy? Do you liken yourself a armchair napoleon? Do you like to subjugate vast civilizations militarily or dominate them through economic imperialism? This game is for you. You know to scratch your imperial itch...because you know the damn hippies won't let you have your fun in real life.
2784	1	a	A good expirience for total war fans 
5276	1	a	Incredibly fun and addicting, I couldn't stop playing it. Anyone who enjoys a really deep top-down shooter should love SPAZ.
5099	1	a	Such an amazing game! Great single player. Lots of stuff to unlock. Only wish it had multiplayer. Regardless, still an amazing game to spend lots of time into
4717	1	a	pros : -lasers -story -lasers -pew pew laser guns -lasers -missiles -lasers -drones which are pretty much automated fighters -lasers -there's a sequel coming out yay! -lasers -giant brick that is your mothership -lasers -MASSIVE variety of ships to use -lasers -some tactics to command your ships -lasers -zombies that do stuff -everything but the 1 con -LASERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! -oh, did I mention lasers?  cons : -the sequel isn't out yet :( (no rush)  9001/10 hyped for sequel(PLEASE don't be crap)
2775	1	a	Just bought the game. I'm aware that the game was released years ago but it is still one of the best strategy games out there. Thanks for creating real strategy games with real battle strategies, real struggles and real armies. It's beautiful guys, I will buy the complete saga one game at a time.
2665	1	a	This game is bittersweet, no other game covers the same timeline and has the same gameplay. I wish Empire didn't have so many bugs and poor design choices but it does. I still like it but I think the devs needed more time to properly make it. The AI is dumb and so is the dipolmacy, the troops also bug out constantly. The game almost requires some mods to fix these problems but when it is fixed the game feels a lot better. As a whole I'd recommend it if you're interested in the 1700's and if you do buy this game I'd strongly recommend using a mod like Darthmod to improve alot of the gameplay and make the game feel whole.  I say again; THIS GAME REQUIRES DARTHMOD TO UNLOCK ITS FULL POTENTIAL!
78	1	a	One of my favorite games. Loads of fun in a strategy/puzzle FPS.
4693	1	a	Top down spaceship grind. Mechanics are interesting. Be sure to keep an extra save. Can provide a good power trip or challenge depending on your progression.
3298	1	a	Awesome game 1000% better than Rome 2
728	1	a	Loved it!
4562	1	a	If you're like me and you loved playing top-down space shooters back in the 90's this game will take you right back to your roots. The artwork is nice to look at (other then the character portraits, which are comically bad to look at), and the writing isn't terrible. As far as combat goes it plays great! Being able to have multiple ships flying with you that have decent AI is a wonderful thing.
4836	1	a	I got this for free a few months back and finally gave it a try. Interesting game, it's like an RPG version of 'Asteroids'. You level up and customize your weapons as you go killng asteroids and pirates and zombies. Actually quite challenging and a great time sink.
2238	0	a	The AI hilariously runs in circles and refuses to attack you in battles. The time it takes to progress a single turn is unbearable. I wish this game was good, but it's not. Get Napoleon. Get any other total war game, just not this one unless you want to spend more time laughing and watching enemy units do the stupidest things imaginable against your army as you effectivelly give up on tactics and just bumrush them because it's more convinient and takes less time - not like you'll lose any units anyway.
238	1	a	its dungeon defenders but it doesnt make you want to kill yourself when you play it
3247	1	a	Great game if you like domination, history, and strategy
2657	0	a	Update: Game is prone to crashing regularly in a long campaign game. Makes it unplayable even after the starting few turns of play. Can be stabilized after a few graphics tweaks but both crashes and corrupts saves often enough to discourage play. ***NOT RECOMMENDED UNTIL RESOLVED ***  Empire Total War (E:TW) is a RTS set in the 1700's. It has a single player campaign mode on a strategic map which add to the game greatly (and therefore is a shame that is not multiplayer). A worthy successor to the Total War series and an excellent historical battle simulator.   Graphics are much improved over Mediaeval and Rome TW but the movement controls are worse as the system struggles to path and place units according to their formation and position units around cover: you can often find a unit moving accross the map to nowhere. Indeed AI is generally extremely problematic: units have more of a tendency to not follow movement orders once engaged; units can be blithely matching through enemy ranks as a pitched battle occurs around them; troops will march in front of their own cannons and get killed; horse carriages will go over obstacles (like cannon emplacements and get killed).  Also the campaign game forces storyline battles on you. I had just finished capturing Canada from the French and was ready to re-enter real life when I was thrown into Bunker Hill without warning or explanation and had to fight another battle: a battle I subsequently lost because I had to stop the game and was not allowed to save the game. I had to beat the French in Canada four times before I got the game to a save point where I had won Bunker Hill. This is done for the sake of storyline momentum but but there would have been no harm putting in a save point.  This lack of attention to player experience in interface and storyline is seen also in the exposition in the in-game help. Nowhere does it say that unit will fire into their own troops or how this operates (sometimes they do, sometimes they hit their own troops, sometimes only the enemy), nor how to cancel a building destruction/construction order, how cover works and how units wrap around them, how to cancel a broadside, why are only the first line of troops firing etc. Forums help here but a few more tool tips wouldn't go astray as the experience of using gunpowder weapons is different to the previous more melee centric TW series; archers can arc over troops but muskets travel a flatter trajectory after all.  On broadsides, ship battles are very well done. I haven't player other ship simulators since Port Royal, but it was very satisfying demasting a ship. Again, not a lot of exposition, like that the compass actually refers to wind direction.  Individual unit animations are very good and troops will even jump over obstacles.  Loading times are very slow and the system does not quite know how to handle two monitors.  In all, a very good game that is puntuated by poor AI, poor exposition, forced stroyline battles you cannot save, and no restart button as in other TW games.
4916	1	a	A bit of a grind maybe, but it's fun and unlocking new tech was extremely addictive. The game doesn't require a lot of time at once, but overall I still sunk 40+ hours into it. Coupled with the low price and the fun I had with it it's definitely worth it.
3075	1	a	The best in the Total War Series, Great replayability.
4149	1	a	tis awesome
821	1	a	Until LvL 18 this game is quite ok. Then the difficulty level starts to rise without any sign or reason. A level that you cannot beat without looking into a guide on youtube or s.th. like that. Bad gameplay-design sucks. Game deinstalled. Not to recommend!
3052	1	a	- play as sweden - i want polen :( - declare war to poland in turn 2 - got my â¥â¥â¥ kicked by denmark/norway/saxony/courland/russia by turn 5 - last stand at stockholm - epic last stand for 2 hours - worth it 10/10 would take polen again
533	1	a	Very fun game for the first 2 hours, then the difficulty falls off a cliff and most people stop playing. I've been back to push through a few times but the novelty is gone. A good buy, just know ahead of time that you will probably only get 2-3 hours gaming from it.
4845	1	a	This is a damn good game. A wonderful old school space shooter with a lot of challenge. You will spend many hours in this game blowing up tons of others ships for their resources, their upgrades, or just to blow through their stargates. It can get a bit repeditive, but if you're experiancing that, then go to a system that's a higher level than you, and you will find yourself with more than enough challenge. I'm astounded by the quality of this two man made game, and I look forward to their updates, and anything else they make in the future.
1571	1	a	This is a very good entertaining stratergy game and is personaly one of my favourates. It is extremely entertaining and the battles you fight are excelent. They are not laggy and run smoothly and it is also alot of fun to command an army!. There are many different things you can do on this game and it is up to you how you choose to build your empire and because of this every time you replay empire total war it is just as enjoyable as the first time you played it. I highly recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of stratergy games and i would personaly rate it 9/10.
3000	1	a	This game is great in vanilla but absolutely brilliant with mods. I'm using the Minor Factions Revenge mod and it just makes an already great game 10 times better! Of course, this game does have a few bugs here and there that can be infuriating at times, such as units getting stuck on walls in seiges, but it's enjoyable nonetheless.   The revolution mechanic is very ambitious and I love the changes to flags. The campaign drawback is that regions such as France and Spain are not split up enough, and taking the capital (which is easy enough anyway) is all you need to do to capture it. They don't even have Wales or Northern Ireland as regions, which means destroying Britain is as simple as taking those three regions early on in the game. It annoys me that these 3 major nations can be so easily destroyed so early. The multiplayer connections are also very dodgy and you will need a Hamachi network with your friends if you want to play with them.  But besides those few negatives I really enjoy this game and recommend it to anyone who enjoys Total War games. 9/10
4341	1	a	I think this is the funniest Total War game, they ever have made, it just gives so much more play time, with three continents, and 9 faction (plus a questline). The diplomacy in this game is much better than in the other of their games (maybe on the same stage as Rome total war 1). and the time period is just the most exiting of them all! I will with no doubt say that this is a epic game!!!
3310	1	a	its awsome...lil bugs but overall awsome
4523	1	a	This is one of the most simplistic RPGs I have ever played. And I love it. It's so addicting. I really wish the community had a bigger following, it's really rare to find such a simple game with such high entertainment value and replayability,
424	1	a	Awesome tower defence game. lots of fun and very original.
671	1	a	I picked this game up cheap in a bundle and was very surprised at how very awesome it is. It combines FPS, tower strategy, and humor in delicious proportions. I find it hard to quit. Each level requires its own analysis to determine the best defense, the options are endless, and I don't always get it 'right' and get overwhelmed the first time through. A perfectly played map leads to total personal satisfaction. Orcs Must Die can be played casually in 15 minute bursts, but it is easy to get sucked into multi-hour sessions that leave you tense, sweatry, and carple-tunneled out.
3438	1	a	this game is amazing. the best TOTAL WAR game i have played get this game if you are looking for a fun and challenging rts game
4020	0	a	Empire: Total War. Sigh.  I really tried to give this a chance, ignoring the launch issues at the time, and not even getting it until 5 years after it's original release. That time should have been more than adequate for any outstanding bugs or problems to be fixed, but Empire: Total War was a victim of its own ambition, and it still has glaring flaws, the AI and the broken siege battles.   To be fair, the game has its pros: the 18th century's scope, 3 theatres of war, the fun of directing line battles and the major bugs that prevented it from being playable are gone, but it still feels lacking and solely unpolished. Which hurts.  If you love the period and can stomach its faults it is servicable, but it certainly is not a great Total War.
908	1	a	this is a fun game that incolces a lot of mayhen and highjinxes but can also challenge your skill.
5100	1	a	Awesome oldschool feel with newschool mechanics. Im hooked!
1539	1	a	Empire Total War.    First of all, Empire Total War is the first Total War title to feature naval battles (which I suck at). But the community had been asking for this for ages. So, I'm glad it finally came to be.   Gameplay wise. The battles are fun weather it be a massive battle for control of a nations capitol or a small skirmish to harass an enemy force. The campaign map is massive in size and would take ages to fully conquer (Most I ever got was 75% or so). Two things I dislike about this game is the A.I pathing and the A.I. politics. When it comes to pathing its okay and I get it can be hard to do with units made up of a hundred men but when of these men get stuck trying to walk through a cart its brutal. For some reason when one guy gets stuck the whole unit looses the ability to move, shoot, or follow orders properly. Then the politics. The computers are down right awful at times you can offer then every cent you have for one piece of tech and they'd decline.  Other those two details its a great game. The massive scale, the awesome battles, the variety of units, the tactics, the maps, the world map all work together to make a great game.
3023	1	a	One of my favourite Total War titles, it's just a shame they haven't enabed workshop for it. 
4616	1	a	One of the nicest indie game I've ever played. You destroy ship to get XP and ressources to buy bigger, better ships to be able to destroy more ships. Each planetary system has 2 factions, and you can choose one faction or the other in each system. Later in the game, you can destroy some zombie ships, and it gives a little more challenge to the game. There is even bounty hunters that are not part of any factions and that can hunt you down if the bounty on your head is big enough. There is one big problem in this game : there is a time when you need to grind a lot. I've played 24 hours and I still haven't finished the game because I need to grind the XP and the ressources to go further in the game. It's truly a good game and I had a lot of fun playing it but it takes a lot of time to finish.
1372	1	a	First Total War game, and still is my faviort after playing Napelon, Shogun 2, Rome II, and Attila. (Not saying those games are bad) The game just has somthing to it that is diffrent from every other Total War game. I would sugest to new Total War players.
3849	1	a	An amazing iteration of total war, for fans of previous titles this will make sense, the battles are much slower affairs were fire and move is the only way to make things work otherwise a fantastic and extremely deep simulation of world domination  awesome
1017	1	a	
2974	1	a	Love this game can't wait for the next
1625	1	a	Great strategy game; still having fun after years of replay.
5255	1	a	Great game, super simple. Has hours of playability.  
241	1	a	Highly recommended for the fans of the genre.
1969	0	a	There are a lot of bugs in this game. It needs to be fixed.
5079	1	a	Fun game, good RPG, with some funny bits. played 40ish hours.
4322	1	a	'I'vv hadddd the time of my lifffffe and I owe it all to youuuuuuu'
5086	1	a	Great little game, soaks up more time than you'd expect.
1685	1	a	The best game i ever palyed in my life i love the battles and sieges
3528	1	a	I would totally recommend this game, and its successor, Napoleon: Total War. These are two of the greatest strategy games I've played, and I've played a ton.  If you're interested in controlling a vast empire, fine-tuning your economy, researching technologies, maneuvering great armies, or fighting immense, real-time battles with thousands of soldiers marching, firing, charging, and dominating, then this game is for you.
1605	1	a	Love it! Great tactics! Conquered the world under Great Brittan in 70turns and made 120k a turn without cheats. Love the artillery and Light Infantry, Only better total war game is Rome II
4658	1	a	As the Britishism goes, 'Does exactly what it says on the tin' You get space pirates and you get zombies.  Somehow this genre jumping game manages to capture real time space battles, resource management and zombies well.  Granted, the game suffers a bit from trying to do too much at once, but I would much rather a game try too much than not enough.  3.5/5
2638	1	a	love this game buy it now
4018	1	a	Easy and Normal-meh the Ai just keep running around the battlefield and sending sucide squad,but steam roll them is fun..  go Hard and Very Hard-good god how did the Ai had money income so fast..ouch..and their shooting muskets accurate than my troops..  Well two can play the  game:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLZzeP7m8jM   For coward like me I guess...well now Im okay..at least United States are not bad,since America had lot of technologies already(and so other nations..damn)  Well of course if u want to conquer the world,just go the bank..11/10  --------------------------------------------------------------------------- I found its funny how the an army of Company Infantry(EIC from India)travel the sea to get to America..lol Maratha destroy Britain..yea of course Britain Campaign Ai are damn sick,they just sit in London all the time(they dont even care about the frenchies....except in America..yea.. The only way to made easy attack on fort was use Hard Mortar(Grenadiers)Russian or Ottoman,just use line infantry as bait,and let the grenadiers shoot their boomstick and let the grenade land on enemy feet 11/10 Use carronade frigate to pound heavy first rate,such wow...wow Pirate Galleon front cannon shoot my 4th rate(1 cannon hit)-kaboom...roasted sailor..such wow Enemy artillery crew(just rallied from broken) using my dead crew cannons to shoot my troops from rear 0_O  This game fun when AI doing something good to kill your army.    
1096	1	a	I've never killed so many orcs in my life!
618	1	a	Burst the orcs into pieces! Quite a few weapons and tons of traps promise orc-slashing fun. Nice mechanics, pretty good overview, and a funny background story (which is not all too important, I claim :P ).  All in all a rather nice game to play.
3723	1	a	one of the best tactical games i have ever played
3003	1	a	love the game are u guys fix it so i can play it one window 7 thats would be great
1619	1	a	very adictive game , awesome with darthmod
5128	1	a	More fun than you'd think, multiplayer would be a wonderful addition.
2112	1	a	i hightly recommand this :) Best one i play control and others maybe hard but you'll get use to it :)
4443	1	a	i think aoe 3 should have a workshop to create more stuff
1737	1	a	Just awsome
484	1	a	one comment were mentioning that game as  'hidden gem'  ought to buy now 'hidden gem 2' 
3097	1	a	Empire Total was is simply the best, and only game of its genre that offers this kind of entertainment, strategy, city building and enjoyment. I have put over 360 hours into this game, and I thoroughly recommend it. An epic piece for fans of the 18th centrury warfare, naval battles, diplomacy, and city building/economics. The premise is quite basic, guide your empire in conquering the world! Modify your cities, manage your armies, use strategy to defeat your opponents. Forge alliances and press forward as your nation becomes more prestigious! A must own, must play!
4705	1	a	94 hours later i finished the game.  Had a lot of fun doing it too.   Should you get this game?  Yes. Yes you should.
2458	1	a	Are you going to ever make a civil war north and south total war pc game for us to play and enjoy?? Anyway this total war Empire ROCKS MY WORLD !!!!!!! Thank you for taking the time to make this pc game... Are you also going to make a total war WW 1 AND WW 2 pc game for us to play and enjoy???
2807	1	a	its very fun , the archivments are a wee bit hard to get though
2256	0	a	its crap do not buy it it is not worth 20$ more like 1$ the gameplay is crap units turn to pixels
643	1	a	'I really like this game'
4044	1	a	Buggy as hell. Yet fun to run a nation in the age of enlightment and empires.
1262	1	a	A very wierd but fun game that makes me think of Gauntlet for some reason  Video Review Below:  http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=269705143 
2946	1	a	This game is for the people who like a good strategy game and time killer in certin ways.
4107	1	a	GREAT GAME AND AWESOME BATTLES
3373	1	a	best game played in a long time need more like this
4816	1	a	An addicting Shooter RPG that on this rare occasion is not an FPS! SPaZ grants you limitless gameplay consisting of dogfighting, micro, and macro managing several elements throughout the vastness of the unending and randomely generated campaign.
630	1	a	what can we say, splendid splendid stuff, great fun that we keep coming back to and it's damned hard at times too!
3786	0	a	Want to play a total war game? Get Rome II.
4325	1	a	Just Fanatastic!
223	1	a	Meh. Good for a while.
113	1	a	Good game! It can get challenging and have you truly under pressure but good strategy and using some basic evil intuition will have you mulching orcs into a pleasant and nutritional sauce! Bathe in that stuff youngster... it'll keep you sharp and youthful inside long past the point where hope and happiness fades into a bitter diy tincture that doesn't heal the wound that won't close... yes.... a most excellent orc genocide simulator! Bonus creatures included for happy end!! and it had a very good sequel also! :D
3391	1	a	If you played any of the previous total war strategy games and found them enjoyable, I strongly recommend this game.
4564	1	a	Cheap and â¥â¥â¥â¥ing awesome, made by just 2 guys but loads of fun
2882	1	a	Amazing game, one of my personal fav's. So much detail has been put into this game. From the Animations, to the little navy men on the Boats! Crisp Graphics, that I can run on my computer!   10/10! Awesome Stradegy game!
470	1	a	Tower defense game that's just straight up FUN.
4158	1	a	this game is awesome :D
1481	1	a	Turned-based-strategy at its finest moments.
2808	1	a	A truly amazing game. I would rate it around 7/10 with no mods. If you include whole game conversion mods like Darthmod it is 9/10 rating. You could go hours on end of playing this, just going through Europe, America or India.
3344	1	a	same as medival but in the 1700s and new untis and a new ship battles
1230	1	a	Alright 'Tower defense' game 7/10
333	1	a	I haven't played many tower defense games (TF2 playing as engineer counts, right?), but this is the only one I've played that I've actually enjoyed. Tower defense from third person action-game perspective. Good times
2321	1	a	Brilliant game, best campaign map of all the total war games spanning across 3 continents, and most varied troop types between nations I have ever seen! Best TW game by far and totally doesn't deserve its reputation as an unreliable game! :)
423	1	a	So first off, got this game during a Steam Sale for cheap, didn't think I would like it. Boy was I wrong! Finished the first game in a good amount of time, got addicted, bought the second one NOT on sale, finished that one too. Excellent game mechanics, gameplay is smooth on my rig, and I really enjoyed the humour and storyline. All in all 10/10
4732	1	a	
467	1	a	A whole lot of manic fun, you wont mind how repetative it actually is under its shiny cell-shaded surface and you will have completed it several times long before you ever wanna stop playing it.  One of those games that Does Exactly What It Says on the Tin  Orcs Must Die!  4/5 (mash em, boil em, stick em in a stew.)
5212	1	a	Fun balance of tactics and strategy. Potential for very rewarding battles on smaller maps. Can become a bit of a grind on larger maps (&gt;200 stars).
3201	1	a	I actually liked this game a lot as it is more complex and more massive than pretty much all of the other TW games. There really is not much to say about it that is memorable, but overall it is a solid TW expereance with few flaws. I would buy at $10 or below.
2829	1	a	Good all around game. Huge map. Better with more powerful graphics than i have. Napoleon Total War was better even though on a smaller scale.  But most of the civilizations feel exactly the same with only some minor changes between them except Ottoman and Marathan nations.
647	1	a	Funny as hell, DLC is a must though, especially when you want to complete the starter levels without any trouble...
2195	0	a	Now let me start this review by saying that I do not hate this game. I don't. I think its naval combat is very nice, and I do like watching musket barrages tear through my enemy's line infantry like a cavalry saber through a poor infantryman's head.  This being said... the game fails in almost every other capacity, even with Darthmod, I find it the most dull of any Total War. Throughout all Total War (besides the newer ones, although Shogun 2 is the sole exception of them) the games managed to make interesting announcements, fun agents to play with, bloody diverse battles, and intense strategy. None of that is here. The announcer is no longer there, the battles are dull and silent except for the droning pathetic whine of their failure of a soundtrack, the ceasless cracking of muskets, and the droning clatter of drum beats, and to top it all off, the soldiers are all clones. We haven't seen that since â¥â¥â¥â¥ing ROME. What the hell? Of course the Warscape engine destroys this game, collision? Not a thing. Blood? Nope. Generals? They mean nothing. Agents? Might aswell not have them.  The game's AI is pathetic, its battles are dull and meaningless, and all the soldiers feel disgusting and stupid and WRONG. You just don't care about your people. I mean maybe if there were some mods that add an announcer, add more battle sounds, blood maybe, unit model variety, but this game on its own, or with Darthmod alone? Is not very fun.  5.5/10 What the hell CA? How can you fall from Medieval... to this.
3414	1	a	way better then rome 2 total war
201	1	a	Pretty accurate marketing.
4881	1	a	Arcadey 2D space combat, exploration, ship customization, and zombies? Yes please.
2537	1	a	One of the crown jewles in the Total War series. These guys could make a killing if they ever released a 'World: Total War' and made it modable.
1041	1	a	I didn't exspect this game to be this good boy was i wrong! Buy this game now ,trust me on this one
1722	1	a	So far it has been my most played game on steam and the reason for that is the Empire: total war is one of the best strategy games I have ever played.
5130	1	a	This game is pretty badass. It has the perfect combination of Twitch Skill, Tactical Manuvering, and RPG-like progression. It's horribly addicting to keep cruising around space, hoping the next fight you get into will yield the blueprints you need for a sweet, 6 turret-ed ship to round out your fleet. The story is pretty meh, but I just skimmed most of the dialogue anyway. The background chatter that plays during missions and the billboards floating through space can be downright hilarious though.  Since I got this on sale, my only compaint is that it might make me buy Space Rangers 2...
2007	1	a	Probably the best Total War game since Rome.
2305	1	a	One of the best strategy games I have ever played. The world map is just incredible. Definitely recommend for history buffs and strategy gamers.
2325	1	a	One of the best, most in-depth strategy games ever.
1489	1	a	Fun grand strategy, good naval combat.
5225	1	a	toltaly awsome 
5063	1	a	The game is hands down one of the best indie games I have played in the past few years, easily in my top 5 indie games when you consider it's 'fun factor'. The graphics are very pleasing especially for a cartoon look. The sound fit's the game well as does the artwork. SPAZ has several difficulty settings ranging from 'casual just play for fun and never lose' to 'please just kill me now'. On it's most difficult setting even the most experienced gamers will be tested. The galaxy can be created relatively small (still very large offering many hours of gameplay) to massive offering literally hundreds of hours of play time. The map is also randomly generated so replay value is high. Bounty Hunters (free DLC) adds a fourth faction to interact with adding new ways to explore or destroy star systems!  All in all a highly suggested purchase that will offer something to all gamers, casual and hardcore alike.
3642	1	a	Excellent strategy game. The action is real and the graphics are superb.
3512	1	a	Another great addition to the Total War series. I have probably played this title more than any of the others. A strategic and tactical challenge.
2753	1	a	the game has a good game play and it runs fine but it constantly crashes without warning no lag nothing
3913	1	a	Must have patience when you play this game, and it's addicting.
1853	1	a	best game of total war serias !
820	1	a	Very entertaining game with lots of traps/weapons strategies and abilities to kill poor innocent orcs. Also I like game style and humour. Additional weapons in DLC may help too. Try it!
769	1	a	Ridiculously fun game. Easy to lose track of time and actually quite challenging!
2467	1	a	I'M ADDICTED!!!!!!!!
2444	1	a	controlling an empire for world domination, what more could you want for a lazy sunday arvo?!
1951	1	a	One of the best Tw games in my opinion.
4598	1	a	Do not let the price of this rare gem fool you, Because the content this game can offer is well worth more! SPAZ is a fantastic, well-made game developed by only two people who had a dream and made it reality, Creating a stepping stone for others to do the same. After 300+ hours into this game, Here's my experience so far.  PROS:   1. What initially brought me to this game was how alive it felt, With something always going on around every corner of the galaxy. There are many events and little side-missions that make it feel like it's a living, breathing environment  2. While on the surface the mechanics look simple, there is a surprising amount of depth put into how you can personally tailor and customize your ships to your own liking, Giving you the chance to get creative and make many different layouts and strategies on how you want to play.  3. The exploration, With the choice of either a minimum of 150 stars or a maximum of 300 stars, You can set the pace at which you play the game to your own standards. Regardless of what you choose, It takes a considerable time to explore each and every different system, Giving you a reasonable space to scavenge for tech that you may need.  4.The combat, the main focus of this game, Is very engrossing and addictive. The controls are tight, The gameplay is fluid and it's all easy to pickup, But hard to master. From blasting your enemies away with cannons to steadily melting them to scrap from far away, There's plenty of options for you to take down your enemies. (Or civilians, if you're not in the most merciful mood!)    CONS:  1. The game can become very repetitive, With most side-missions being recycled, And many tasks needing to be done in order to progress with reputation.  2. It can feel very grindy, especially early on in the game when you need to farm resources and levels if you ever get stuck on a quest.  3.    The Zombies in the game can become very tedious to clear out later on in the game,       This game has brought me tons of priceless joy, I hope I had shared some of that experience with you all, Because even with all that I said, I still can't express or put into words how much I love this game, Thank you for reading this far, Have a pleasant day.
4070	1	a	Play total war to become a warmaster!
2025	1	a	when i first baught this game i was very confused on the controls and functions so i put it asside for quite a while. but i came back to this and tried my best to master this even thoe now im kind of crappy with multi battles i soon got used to all the functions strategys and functions i say this is a great game !
2200	1	a	a very good classic stratagy game xD 
2594	1	a	    BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!     No For Real One of The Best 5/5 Stars  Best Regards-  KStone111  
1757	1	a	Great game. I would highly recommeds it.
4760	1	a	WYSIWYG: Space, Pirates and Zombies (and Bounty Hunters)!
5287	1	a	very fun game with good rpg aspects.
2805	1	a	One of my favourite games
4955	1	a	I purchased SPAZ on a whim; it's not the type of game I usually play but, more importantly, it's not the sort of game I actively avoid either.  To get the criticisms out of the way first, SPAZ has a fairly steep and unforgiving learning curve. Attempting to quickly punch through warp gates and advance the story will end in complete destruction. Lengthy and repetitive grinding sessions are required in order to keep your tech levels high enough to survive.  That said, SPAZ is insanely addictive, fun and the payoffs are worth it. What could be better than more, bigger and better ships?  ... and that's even before the zombies come into play.  I definitely can't wait for SPAZ 2.
4150	1	a	The best stratigic simulation I've played ever!!!
1249	1	a	It's super funny to play this!
1974	1	a	spam life guards and arty gas and u win
259	0	a	Nah. It's not a terrible game, but it's clunky and awkward. Micro-managing the camera angle is half of what you'll do when playing. Go look for a better tower defense game.
5184	1	a	If you like old school space shooters (asteroids) but like the story and graphics of modern space shooters (Halo) then this is the game for you
1701	1	a	For the Republic!
3245	1	a	Addicting, but buggy game. 
3510	1	a	Historical gameplay at its best. Using the expertly designed economy system, improve your empire and build an army to take over the necessary territories to win the game. A straightforward mission, that involves the historicla desires of each player. Secondary campaigns, such as the Road to Independence also illustrate how history drives this game. The map is highly realistic in geography and style, though the water is a little strange (too reflective). The battles are intense and require real strategy. You have to know what your units can do and where to place them, and bringing a larger force to a battle and then pressing auto-resolve is not always a guarantee of success. I have played every campaign, and they are all interesting. The economics are very true to real life. Over-tax the lower class and the population declines from lack of goods and services, over-tax the wealthy and their abilty to generate wealth drops until you can't bring taxes down without going bankrupt. But keeping them up causes rebellion.  True to history and realistic gameplay, much better for those who want a real-life experience and not the AI drive style of the Civilization franchise.
2906	1	a	A must have for all RTS Fans and those interested in the Era. Most ingenious Total War game ever  Cavalary, Infantary, Ships, Sieges and even Cannons! Empire: Total War is the best Total War Game. It is definetly at least in the top 3 RTSs I have played so far.  The presentation is pretty good with menus easily laid out. In things like battles and in a campaign, there are panels that are easy to access on stuff like government and units. The Graphics look impressive if set to max. However even, on lower settings, the game still looks pretty good. Sounds are authentic as well with muskets and cannons. In terms of gameplay, there is everything a Total War game should have and   more  . The campaign mode is defintely pretty awesome where you pick a faction and play for world domination. In the Road to Independance Campaign, you play as the United States in the events that lead to the declaration of independance. There is also a skirmish mode where you can choose a map/scenario and choose your units and battle it out. Multiplayer is also present for those who want a human challenge.  Overall GREAT and excellent replayabilty.
2518	1	a	There are still a few bugs but in general I think the game is well worth the money spent if you like turn based strategy games. The batles are where most of the bugs are because the AI does really stupid stuff. However if you choose auto combat the game can be pretty fun on a grand scale. There are several campaigns to play and you can choose from several different nations and play in different languages... kinda neat but annoying as well because you can't turn the foreign language off. Different factions have different unique units also... some of them are neat and some are not. I have spent what I consider to be a lot of time playing this game and enjoyed most of it.
5302	1	a	It has a party style RPG feel to it but in space. You can customise the ships and equipment, need money to puchase it, and expeience to equip it. you can control each ship individually, pause to give commands, or let AI run your no active ships. The story is good, but I enjoyed the gameplay more. It's very grindy.
2777	0	a	Before you jump onto this game, understand that SEGA does not update this game at all. There are glitches,bugs, and crashes that are going to make you hate this game. You will play over 5 hours and when you take a break then come back to it, the saved file is unplayable. The game will just crash randomly, usually at the loading screen. This game has a lot of great features, but the total lack of updates, and support, keeps it from being playable.
4428	1	a	I have about 200 hours on this game and its still fun, if they would update the game I would balance the line units but thats it oveerall good game
3895	1	a	Started as Austria-Hungary. Made alliance with Polish Commonwealth and a truce with Ottomans. Started expansion into Western Europe. Conquered Italy and Northern Africa. Broke truce with Ottomans. Conquered the Balcans and Greece. Made new truce. Spain conquers Portugal. ohneinyoudidn't.jpeg  Declare war to France and make alliance with Great Britain. Conquer southern France and vilipendiously destroy Spain. France wants a truce. Demand territory in America. Get free New France and Quebec for peace. Expand south, destroying the Thirteen Colonies with GB's help. Meanwhile destroy the Ottomans and start annihilation of the Indians (maharya).  Meanwhile I already conquered the entirety of southern Europe, plus the American East Coast, some Caribbean isles and northern India.  &gt;forget to realise Poland was conquered some turns ago &gt;Sweden dominates Eastern Europe &gt;they attack me &gt;I forget about the main territory near the capital &gt;suffer extreme casualties  11\10 would burn IKEA furniture again
834	1	a	The launch trailer was made to 'The Hall of the Mountain King', performed by Apocalyptica. If you need any other incentive, you are a strange man indeed!
3905	1	a	Enjoyable combat with a huge vareity of units to suit every play style and every situation. The game also has gives you the ability to become overlord of the world and what's not to like abiut that.
2335	0	a	The AI in this game is so subpar its a joke. CA never bothered to really fix this game, just released it and moved on to the next game. A game that fixed alot of these problems, and then never bothered to retro fix Empire. BOOOO
3098	1	a	Possibly the best Total War game i have ever played, it's great being able to march regiments against natives and frenchmen alike. I much enjoyed this game. It is far more user friendly than it's predecessors such as Medieval II as it is easier to keep your economy in the positive. It also is the biggest scale.
3506	1	a	Empire Total War is a spectacular game to play. Besed on the 18th century American Revolutionary War.
2717	0	a	Sick and tired of game crashes! Although this is one hell of an awesome strategy game to play - it's not worth the frustration of dealing with the constant crashes. Too bad, could be an EPIC game with some serious tweaking by the software guys!
1379	1	a	This game was a long experince for me but i always tried to conquer the world becasue in this game there are no rules only the BLOOD OF YOUR ENEMIES!
3557	1	a	As with any RTS, it takes some time to get used to if you are not familiar with the total war games, but after finishing the American campaign, I had a solid grasp of the mechanics. The diversity of the units really adds a lot of depth to the game, and the real-time battle mechanics are very well executed. It can get a bit repetetive at times, but on the whole, I really enjoyed the grand campaign. Go team Poland-Lithuania.
2257	1	a	this has NOTHING to do with Harry Potter!!!
1143	1	a	I rate the game 9 out of 10, 10 if there was a multiplayer option. Must buy!
233	1	a	Great game, great times! Funny easily enjoyable game.
2958	1	a	This is one of the best RTS games I've ever played
3655	1	a	Its a pretty good game if your computer can handle it -_-
3573	1	a	Great game to waste time on. Despite a certain friends disdain for musket volley's sooo much fun to conquer the world. Has all the fit and polish and to me is the last best Total War. Rome II left me wanting more, but this one was perfect.
3957	1	a	This is my favourite Total War Game. Maybe it's the time periiod as I'm really interested in the history but the game is really fun too. Both Vanila and Modded it''s fun to play. While the units are all quite similar, each Nation has it's strengths and weaknesses. i love the Naval combat and usually rely heavily on Navies for blockading and trade superiority in my play style. Play it. The only downside is that your allys will turn on you for no reason and the diplomacy sucks. Mods try to fix this though.
4763	1	a	Can't wait for the sequel.
180	1	a	This is like a tower defense game, in which you build catapults, and traps to kill ogres to prevent them from reaching their objective. Really entertaining and challenging.
4758	1	a	Great game. Replay value is high, too.
2928	1	a	10 Reasons to download this game:   1. Sweden is a â¥â¥â¥â¥ on it. 2. I didnt accept a trade agreement from India.... they declared war.  3. Cuba is the best investment. Go forth and conquer. 4. Pirates are â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.  5. Ruparts Land is the Empire: Total War Version of Old Kent Road. 6. Why do Generals get old and die? (RIP 5* General)  7. The only thing worse than pirates and Sweden is Spain. Suck a â¥â¥â¥â¥.  8. Pikemen are useless.  9. Armies loose all knowledge of tactics and training when in a fort.  10. Sea battles are for auto sim.   All comments and opinions are from my current gameplay and are no way based on true events.   But honestly Add to basket. its fun    
4210	1	a	Great game, great time period and great battles
3090	1	a	Great game, love it! Seriously it's great!
5155	1	a	Its the dark souls of space.  YOU WILL NOT BE HAPPY.  But buy it.
4451	1	a	The original Age of Empires packed a stunning visual punch and backed it up with solid gameplay. Back at a time where most strategy games were chunky and 2D, the first Age game pulled aside the curtain to reveal a world that was sunny, animated, colorful and lifelike. Strategy games were never the same. Age of Empires III presents a similar leap forward for real-time strategy fans. As Half-Life 2 did for first-person shooters, AoE III shows just how inspiring these games can be when lovingly crafted with outstanding artistry and solid gameplay fundamentals.   Age of Empires III doesn't redefine real-time strategy gameplay. You're still scurrying to collect more resources than your opponents and rushing to field a giant army, and the game still rewards frantic clicking and unit management. But the presentation is unmatched, and even though the game is rooted in RTS conventions, there are enough new elements and strategic variations here to addict even grizzled veterans. If you're a fan of the genre, you owe it to yourself to check this game out. And if you've never played a real-time game before, this is the place to start.  Graphically, the engine that powers Age of Empires III has a laundry list of the latest graphics technology: real-time shadows, high dynamic range lighting, you name it. There's even bump-mapping on the barrels of the cannons. But the real impressive thing about the technology isn't that it's there, it's that you don't notice it. From the moment your Home City first appears on the menu screen, or a new map loads up to reveal pale grey waters lapping quietly against rocky New England shores, you become lost in the game world. The latest in technology is coupled with truly beautiful art.  Age III pulls out all the stops to depict the sweeping majesty of the old west or the unspoiled beauty of the colonial-era Americas. One of the single-player campaign cutscenes, done in the game engine, pans across rolling hills of golden grass while huge herds of buffalo amble along like waves of water. Another level depicts a small Caribbean port picking up the pieces after a devastating hurricane, with citizens milling about amidst wrecked ships and broken docks. Yet another level has you picking your way through a dense swamp looking for the ruins of Spanish treasure ships half-buried in the mud and dripping with gold doubloons. You're never lacking for eye candy.  The music is equally impressive. Done in full orchestra, it moves effortlessly from majestic scores highlighting the beauty of the landscape to pounding battle drums accenting the fury of battle.   Of course, the combat is equally spectacular. The goal of the game is to devastate your opponents, and said devastation is accompanied by deeply satisfying images of destruction. A large part of this has to do with the real physics incorporated onto the game engine. You can feel the impact when a cannonball shatters into a wooden frontier building, breaking it into pieces that fly off in macabre arcs. Smoke billows from muskets, cannons leap back as they expel their fury, building spires burst into flame and collapse into themselves, and the masts of ships crash to the deck as the vessel shudders with the impact of enemy fire. Every game of Age of Empires III drips with spectacle.  Age III simulates colonization, meaning that the town you build in the game can request 'shipments' from your Home City. You gain new shipments by earning experience, and you have a set list of things that you can send over. This has a profound impact on your strategy. Do you send over economic resources early, to give your town a leg up on the competition? Or do you send over tons of military units, so that you can field an advanced army while your neighbors are still building up? Shipments add a lot to the game by giving you more strategic possibilities, and by giving you incentive to rapidly earn experience. They really reward players for going out and making things happen around the map.   Every map is also dotted with Native American villages or trade routes that can be built up by your colony. Controlling a trading post gives you free experience or resources whenever a trade cart comes by, whereas Native American villages can provide you with inexpensive military units or technology upgrades. Controlling these points on the map gives you a major edge over the long term. As a result, it's a rush to be the first to locate these points, and they are always hotly contested. Battles usually play out as a series of skirmishes across the map before big conflicts rage at the town centers.  Finally, Age of Empires III adds the 'Home City' concept. Outside of the real-time portion of the game, you can create a Home City representing the world power that's supplying your colonies. Your Home City has a level - like an RPG character - representing how experienced it is. As you earn experience playing the game your city will 'Level up' and you can choose new abilities for it, in effect deciding what kinds of shipments you'd like to send to your colonies. The decision about what kinds of upgrades to make to your city is agonizing and has a tangible impact on the main game. It's also fun just to level up, develop, and customize your own personal city. One nice side effect here is that, even if you get totally â¥â¥â¥-whupped in a multiplayer game, you probably still earned a lot of experience to use to develop your city. This concept works great all around and really contributes to the game.  The single-player campaign is divided into three acts representing three generations of the same family. Picking up where Age of Kings left off, the lead character in the first campaign is a Knight adventuring in the New World in search of a lost treasure. Said treasure impacts his whole family line, as depicted in Act II, a rip-roaring Davy-Crockett style adventure starring his Grandson. Act III picks up two generations later, featuring a wild west romp involving railroads, the Mexican war, and a quest into the Amazon jungles before the family finally finds closure. As with the other production values of the game, the writing is solid and the voice acting is great.   There's a good variety of missions in the single-player campaign, from protecting a stronghold until help arrives to building a railroad line to battling pirates along a series of islands. None of the individual scenarios have you doing things that hadn't been done in other RTS games, but the real magic is in the gameplay, which allows you to develop a different Home City for each act and tackle each scenario differently.   Truly hardcore strategy gamers might find lots of nitpicks in Age of Empires III. It's difficult to unload transport ships, healers have to be micro-managed or they'll charge into combat, and there aren't a lot of options for customizing your hotkeys. Artillery units on occasion can't decide to fire or pack up to move. But the important thing is that none of these little problems really impacts the core game.   Age of Empires III is an absolutely fantastic title with superb graphics and tight gameplay. Single-player or multiplayer, no matter what your skill, you'll get hours of joy out of this sucker online or off. Age of Empires III may not redefine real-time strategy gaming, but it sets the bar so high that we'll be comparing games to this for years. Shoulder your musket and pony up: this one's a real trip.
2969	1	a	TL;DR: This game is great! Definitely pick it up if it's on sale.  Gameplay: Empire: Total War alternates between grand strategy and RTS style gameplay, and while it certainly isn't the greatest game in either of these categories, the combination makes for a very immersive experience. The game has several difficulty settings, allowing for new players to settle in to the game, while still providing a decent challenge to experienced players, at least for the RTS portions. Navel combat was a first for the Total War franchise and it works decently. The grand strategy elements are toned down somewhat from what you might expect from a Paradox game, though this shouldnât be a surprise.  Visuals: For a game of its age, Empire Total War looks fantastic. On release, this was actually seen as a negative, as there were concerns that the minimum requirements for the game would make it inaccessible to many fans of the series. However, in 2015, the excellent quality of the visuals makes this game timeless.  Story: The setting of Empire Total war is what makes this game my favorite Total War title. Itâs set between the 100 year period from 1700 through 1799. The story mode itself isnât anything special, but rarely do you play a grand strategy game for a linear storyline. In most of the campaign modes, the outcome of the game is mostly up to you. Do you want to become a great trading nation, or is world domination more your style?  Sound: For the most part, the battles sound great. The overworld also features decent sound, but overall thereâs nothing here to write home about.  Music: The music in the overworld doesnât change much, but doesnât usually get annoying. If it does, the plus is that you can mute it and very little is lost. The music during battle sequences is fitting, but nothing I would add to a playlist.  Overall Assessment: Empire: Total War may lack the depth of a Paradox title, and may not be the greatest and most innovative RTS in existence, but what it sets out to do, it does well. The game is generally priced higher for an older title, but if you see this one on sale, itâs definitely worth your time.
3587	1	a	Very addicting, love the naval battles and the idea of moving troops across the globe to conquer. a bit slow at first, but after 20 years things are much more fast paced and exciting. Not to mention the advancment in technology.
1825	1	a	There are negatives to this game but so many more positives, it's may Fav of the total war series and I hope that they make EMPIRE 2, it's been a long time waiting.
3567	1	a	I love this game
2978	1	a	Still and forever will be my favourite Total War game...
763	1	a	Really great Game! Its ratehr addicting and loads of fun. Sadly this one is only single player but OMD2 is multiplayer so i would suggest getting that 1 to play with friends, but this is still an awesome game totally worth 10$. You'll get your moneys worth if you like Tower Defense games with a 3rd person shooter/melee/magic twist.
2127	0	a	The reason for my downgrade is simple, you can buy Napoleon, much better and less bugs.
3644	1	a	you can capture ships. best game period. realistic slave colonialism, so godly. its real as all heck
5020	1	a	Fun, very open universe. Gives you a lot of freedom to explore, destoy, and build.
2216	1	a	Because Empire !  But if you really want to know what we can do in this game, here's a short list :  - Remove Kebab ! - Make America great again ! - The French will run away ! (100% realistic) - Even with mighty canon, Poland cannot into space !  Bayonet always win, best geopolitical simulator with a lot of democracy, not like fake modern European countries !   I should recommend to everyone if not full of bug, but I will do it anyway ! 10/10, would corrupt savefiles and backup at the same time again !
3064	1	a	Great game, have been an fan of all previous total war titles and this is just as good. Have spent enough hours playing now so have a good feel for the game and i can recommend it 100% if you enjoy RTS games. Only negative for me is the lack of playable factions, there are many in the game but only a few are available for the campaign unfortunately, of course this problem can be addressed with mods to allow you to play as all of these factions, and adds many more.  On the whole i would give this game 8.5/10 and highly recommend it for veteran or new players. 
3118	1	a	If you like turn-based strategy and watching long lines of infantry spend 95% of the time in combat reloading, then this is the game for you
5060	1	a	It's quite the fun game, roaming around the galaxy and shooting stuff (tm). After about 15h of gameplay at about lvl 35, it gets a bit repetitive tho. Advances of your own equipment have slowed down considerably, while the opponents get stronger and stronger. Good there is also a story line to keep you going. Gonna pick up playing again at some later stage, thumbs up so far.
4368	1	a	Could've been one of the greatest of all time.
2403	1	a	It's great if you like history and strategy!
591	1	a	If you like third-person shooters with a mix of tower defense, then 'Orcs Must Die!' is something you'll probably enjoy. Play as the former wizard's apprentice, the War Mage, as you strive to protect magical rifts to the protagonist's homeworld. Those gateways set in various fortresses, you build a variety of traps or even fight head-on with various weapons/abilities to keep hordes of orcs and other monsters from reaching their goal. The game is so fun that will have you hecticly thinking on your virtual feet to plan the many ways to dispatch the onslaught. Replay levels several times after you manage to unlock all the traps, weapons and upgrades to see if you can make it to the top of the leaderboards amongst your friends or the rest of the world. Seriously, you'll have lots of fun.
1357	1	a	I still remember the time when the French army steamrolled Western Europe and India while it's closest ally, Great Britain, ruled the continent of North America. Today, both parties coexist in peace.  10/10 Would change history again  *EDIT*  Note: If you are trying to install a modification for the game, please know the procedures of installing said mod. Because if you do not know what you are doing, you will end up having a broken game.
4853	1	a	Surprising depth to the combat system, combined wih a bucket load of different hulls and components, and a thoughtful tech tree, and a variety of other well executed game mechanics, keep this game from getting old.
2536	1	a	Another excellent example of the Total War series at it's best. It does on occasion get to be too much for my little Gateway from Walmart's capabilities but that will not sour my appetite for re-enacting the birth of our nation in full, violent Total War style. I particularly enjoy the levels of realsm and immersion based details that seem to dominate the series. An introduction into real naval combat, other than just for transportation is challenging but very rewarding. The DLC's are good and a worthy addition to the base game. I wouldn't go without them as it seems a bit one sided to pay only as the Europeans and not the Native Americans on the War Path DLC. But as in history, I guess to be totally accuratem don't be expecting to dominate right away with the Natives as it was challenging with limited access to firearms and artillery, it will be a struggle intially where stealth is key when using only bows and tomahawks vs. muskets with bayonets and artillery fire. But don't et the challenge seem daunting, any TWC vet worth their salt can lick the British invaders from the Native lands!
1659	1	a	It really is a great game, the only dissapointment is the ai in seige battes  4.5/5 Stars
1754	1	a	I was never a fan of the Total War series but the videos of all those ridiculously huge battles was always something I loved. After being tempted and pushed to try this title by one of my friends, I decided to sit down and give it a go. And I love it. Micromanaging an Empire, building up Units and conquering lands along with huge battles and drawn out sequences make this a tactician's wet dream. This is the first Total War game that I have ever played and sat down thoroughly with.  I am not disappointed.   On the other hand, I was informed by many that [Darthmod] improves the game substantially, so I have never truly experienced the 'Vanilla' version of the game (one which is untouched by mods and 3rd party fixes). I love Darthmod and ETW, both compliment one another and with the whole new addition of extra units and better A.I. this really vamps up the game as a whole. See the end of the review for more links on where to download Darthmod.  I do, however, admit that ETW does suffer from its fair share of bugs and broken game issues but do not let that detract you from buying this. It's a great title. I have purchased all the DLC for the game too and the extra units are *very* much worth it. Heck, even game changing!   A great title, yet sometimes awkward to play due to strange A.I. behaviour and crashes due to... well, we all know that Total War games since Empire are buggy and unfixed.  Overall score: 8/10 (it'd be a lot lower without the mods I've added :p)   Darthmod v.8.0 on ModDB .  I would highly suggest you download this mod via Torrent! It's a lot faster and easier to obtain, I find ModDB's speeds too slow. Be sure to seed back to atleast 90% for everyone else who wants the mod too!
3815	1	a	Good game, a bit difficult
3314	1	a	Brilliant game most played game on my game list multiplayer not as good as it use to be(mind it a few years old now) can get some really awesome mods for this game which can make you play this game for years to come highly recommended
4465	1	a	This game taught me more about history than any high-school course ever did.
3620	1	a	Great strategy game!! ;)
5221	1	a	I love this game and I hope the sequel is coming out soon.
2540	1	a	Be good if i can multiplay with a PC if i use a mac
3562	1	a	This is One of the best Empire type games that i ever played. I have told my friends about this game and will people about this game.
1804	1	a	When it comes to replayability this is the most replayable game in the total war series. It has 3 continents and 4 trading regions.  When it comes to battles this offers a lot of different units ( meele infantry, ranged infantry, meele cavalry, ranged cavalry, elephants, cannons, mortars, rockets, grenades ) and a lot of sea units ( small ships, galeys, frigates, heavy ships of the line, rocket ships, steam ships). And a lot of sieges ( open towns, artillery forts, star forts). When it comes to campaing it offers military, diplomacy, economics and sabotage. What more do you want?! 10/10 would steamroll the world again XD  PS: If you want more hardcore gameplay, download 'Darthmod'.
1871	1	a	If this game was a carrot, It would be a very good carrot.
5133	1	a	This game is really fun, a unique space simulator.
3519	1	a	A brillian entry to the Total War series. It can get immensly tough towards the end game, and in-battle, but it is rewarding to wipe out the French game after game.
3675	1	a	Ive played this game a few years back when the total war complte pack was 75% off and i have played a lot of the game which i find very enjoyable though despite winning in numbers leading a battle yourself can do much better than what the AI/game predicts, Also the other AI nations are unwilling to trade fairly meaning you have to trade 3/4 technologies for just one technology of theirs or have to pay 1000s of ingame gold just to make a trade, ]  Overall a very great game which is great fun to play though does not feel compelling to play after conqouring the whole world in each thetre of war, north america, europe and india aswell as a few sea trading areas.
3577	1	a	Probably the best of the TW series due to the sheer breadth of the concept, Old World, New World and India. Well worth the time to play. Easiest factions are England and Indians. Hardest I've found is the Spanish and Dutch. Once again, only problem is the continual crashing of games every 60 minutes or so. Very frustrating.
5234	1	a	I really love this game. It's simple, to the point, and contains a lot of quality mindless classic top down shooter features with strategy game overtones.  I'm looking forward to the sequel to this game and will be happy to pay full price since it was created by two guys that love games.
2136	1	a	great game
2307	0	a	Empire Total War made some positive changes to the Total War formula (Naval Battles, Map Size) but ultimately missed the mark. The Campaign AI is worse than it ever has been and the political intrigue of the era is totally lost to a brain-dead diplomacy system.
5023	1	a	there are things that arent space pirates or zombies in this game but thats ok  space pirates and zombies 2 looks p cool heres a link   
4569	1	a	I had my fun with this game. Not sure what else to say then its as cheap as a Burger right now, but the burger is eaten in a minute or 2...but this game is gonna entertain for weeks. Also great replayability...doesnt tax computers much, all around good
4654	1	a	Worth a try, surprisingly addictive.
2395	1	a	Other than no multiplayer campaign its a pretty good game.  Indians declared war on Britain, and won. 10/10
2046	1	a	it's alright i guess  too many powdered wigs imo
2068	1	a	One of the best installements in the franchise (Not sure if I said that correctly). This is simply brilliant. It does get kinda annoying managing everything you have once you get big.
2772	1	a	Best total war game so far. The period, the size of the map, the mods, everything is great in Empire.
3413	1	a	Grand strategy for those of us without the time or interest in micro managing every aspect of our empire. Gorgeous graphics, and a very shallow learning curve. Naval battles are a bit slow, but they look so good that you wont mind. The land battles, as always, are unlike any other game. if you liked previous Total War games, you will love Empire.
4363	1	a	The best strategy game by turns I've ever played, I like Age of Empires, but this game is way better and more realistic.
788	1	a	Know about tower defense games? Know about fantasy creatures? Know about humour? Know about shooters? You'll see all of them combined in this amazing action-strategy game by Robot Entertainment.  The main objective is that all orcs must die. But in order to complete that objective, you'll need to place traps and learn spells and forge weapons and train an army and... use your head. And your muscles. Because there are many ways to finish a level. If an orc or one of their allies (kobolds, ogres, goblins) lives long enough to reach the rift you're bound to protect, then it's over. Remeber: you're a War Mage, and War Mages need to protect the rifts at all cost.  You can use the environment, hire troops, place traps, engage them with your weapons, do as you please, as long as you get to carry your objective.  Slice them, burn them, skewer them, and launch them - no matter how you get it done, orcs must die!  
3290	1	a	A good game it is
3701	1	a	from raiding trade routes to launching attacks with thousands of men. whats not to love?
4091	1	a	Great game.
3729	1	a	This is a great turnbased strategy, it was put together perfectly. I've been lost in this game. If world domination is what you crave, you'll love Empire: Total War,   9.5/10
4267	1	a	I recommend this game.
1875	1	a	best total war game yet!!!
1523	1	a	good game worth getting
770	1	a	This is a game that I consistently come back to.  Orcs Must Die is a 3rd person action tower defense game. You are given a countdown timer to run and place your objects, road blocks, and towers before the doors break down and a horde of Orcs, Goblins, Kobalds, Ogres and more come storming through. It's up to you a battlemage to use your spells and wepaons to stop them from running into a portal that takes them into your kingdom.   After a certain level, you unlock Weavers which give your character special bonuses and skill trees. To an extent it's a level-by-level RPG as well. You choose from a backpack of skills and utilities that you have hot keyed to your 1-9 keys.   I got this game for $3.74 during a special, but I'd recommend it at full price no matter what. It's really worth it.  This game has no multi-player, however Orcs Must Die 2 is multi-player.
2514	1	a	A really good game, large map with america,india and europe and you can play as prussia and pwn everything
2121	1	a	Obliterated 3 nations within the frist 5 min of game . 10/10 Would obliterate again .
2980	1	a	Unpopular opinion: Best Total War part so far. A pity, that there's no multiplayer campaign, but the gameplay is great though!
4870	1	a	A more than decent game that can suck you in fast.
2879	1	a	Great game. DLCs are a little glitchy though.
5326	1	a	The only game where another person on the other end of the mic makes you do push ups irl.
3724	1	a	LOVE IT ! I love to be a centrle eueropen power
2434	1	a	Quite possibly the best in the Total War series! Love this game, the increased map size, massive campaign for world domination, fantastic battles and introduction of sea battles although these are rather difficult to get the hang of!  The AI has seen a marked improvement even if it still has moments of bizarre behaviour. The sheer size and scale of this game make it a must buy. On the more difficult settings it proves itself as one of the best strategy games ever made.  The only problem with this game is that it will consume countless hours of your life!
1759	1	a	Hey guys, Im a big Total war fan, take it from me this is the best game in their collection in my eyes. It offers the all round greatest features of a total war game, but plays across 3 theatres and introduces naval battles into gameplay. Along with a personalization of technologies and growth of your nation. Only downside is there is a max of 10 or so nations to choose from. My rating is a 9 outta 10 and a must have for the Stradegy gamer!!!
2029	0	a	Game always bugs out or crashes when you are just starting to enjoy the game.  Total mess/10, play Napoleon or Shogun 2 instead.
3039	1	a	Great game
67	1	a	Combining a tower defense game with a shooter.... awesome! It is also a highly polished and humurous game with tons of replayability.
3823	1	a	to unlock the ultra settings in graphics go in to your 'user' profile in OS (C:)drive 'user' file click it then click the file with your name on it. then 'app data'file then 'roaming' file. then look for a file named 'the creative assembly' click it. then Click file 'empire' the click ' scripts' file then you will see a 'preferences.empire_script' open with note pad and scroll until you see **gfx_video_memory** it will have a '0' next to it erase that amd put '536870192' then save the note pad and it should start poifectly :)
3183	1	a	This game is definitely tied with my favoirte of the Total War series. It was either this one or the Fall of the Samurai expansion for Shogun 2: Total War, and I don't feel comfortable saying an expansion is my favorite game. This game introduced gunpowder and new tactics that were only touched on in the Late period of Medieval 2: Total War. It made for an entirely new set of tactical challenges and strategies to deal with. New diplomacy, trading, and society functions like 'Clamour for Reform' made the game more interesting than the previous games of the series. Plus, ranks of gunpowder infantry... awesome.
4190	1	a	Recommended. My favourite, and in my opinion, the best Total war made. Especially good with Darthmod installed.
1461	1	a	Better than Jennifer Lawrence's tatas
4358	1	a	THIS GAME IS AWESOME best strategy game of all time!!!!!
4743	1	a	AAAAAAAAAAAAAAIIIIYYRRRRHHHH  Ship destroyed.
4828	1	a	A great indie plenty of depth, choices and fun: one of the best mix of genres in a long time.
459	1	a	Very fun and well made tower defense!
1945	1	a	ETW Is My Life! I love it so much I mean who doesn't? Ever Since I got the game, I have tryed to play it with every opportunity I have. But seriously play this game...     You get to use SIR ISSAC NEWTON But unfortunately, you can't reasearch Gravity :(   
2078	1	a	play this  
3653	1	a	Not good.  Rome is better and if you are playing for the setting you should be playing Paradox games.
1743	1	a	It is nice game about 1700 century. I love battles, World map. Only bad side in this game is bad AI and FPS drop in massive fortress battles.
845	1	a	It's very well-made, and fun to play. The traps are pretty interesting and varied, although some are kinda useless.
3072	1	a	I love the Total War franchise though I must admit that this game does it really well, there are a few bugs still relevant even in this age but nothing too bad, there are mods littered across the internet that improve and enhance gameplay. I love the divesity in factions and the different play styles as you work your way through, able to change your government and take yourself either into the greatest war ever or turtle up becomming a trade empire before buying off all your enemies. Would highly recommend this game if you've never tried it before though if you want a total war to get into, it would be a toss up between this and medieval 2.
351	1	a	First-person tower defense, similar to Sanctum, but less serious and more fun.
2004	0	a	This game is beyond terribly optomized, the framerate drops to 24fps whenever you try and move the camrea...ON MEDIUM! I am running a GTX 760 and an i5-4430 processor, this game is from 2009, complete â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t.
2273	0	a	Very disapointing game the units formation system is completly messed up. Better buy MEdieval 2 than this piece of crap.
3034	1	a	Loved it! 10 out of 10! The City Management is different than prevous total war games and takes time to get used too. But over all AWESOME!
1163	0	a	Get Age of Wonders 3 instead, no question. The campaigns here are badly paced, the skirmish maps FORCE your race choice, 'counterattack' is called 'intercept' even though it happens second, and the map and fighting are 97% HoMM. AoW3 is more like a prettier Fallen Enchantress.
1568	1	a	This game is actually hard and tactical, I like that. 9/10
2818	1	a	Without Darthmod it's absolutely pitiful. With darthmod it's my favourite RTS ever. Make of that what you will.
3781	1	a	Became Britan then stopped the American Revolution and urged the world into the anime of Code Geass ALL HEIL BRITANNIA! -10/4
4938	1	a	Great game if you like top-down space combat and squad tactics. Also, space zombies.
4365	1	a	This game has been out for some time and evy time i play it, it just gets better and better even thought there are some AI improvements they need to be desparetly made i still love the game and what potential it still has
734	1	a	I...I think I just realized I don't like tower defense games after all the ones I've tried. I can recognize this as being a well made hybrid of that and a third-person shooter, and there are definitely things about it I can appreciate, but even after trying it twice a couple years apart, I've bounced off it both times. Thanks, Orcs Must Die. You seem like a good game...for someone else.
3702	1	a	I love the game although I played Napoleon more than Empire
4206	1	a	Very addicting game!!! It gives me the satisfaction of ruling the whole world...just had some difficulties with the russians and the marathan confediracy but besides that one of the best game ever!!!
5145	1	a	It gets you addicted in no time. Fun, entertaining to play. One of the best indie titles out there without doubt.
2210	1	a	There boys!! Bring her about!!
5165	1	a	Quite a fun little game if you're into this sort of thing. You know the drill, you start with a piece of crap ship and slowly fight and upgrade your way across the galaxy until you have a fleet of doom.
2436	1	a	I Think i have played this game too much , keep coming back to it time after time , if you like to colonize and have large empires then this game is for you even if you like to keep it small this game has it 10/10 from me
4865	1	a	6.5/10  SPAZ has an amazing demo, the full game however has a few shortcomings:  1. The mercenaries are just too damn powerful to fight and extort you at every opportunity (oh and you WILL NOT win that fight!) The game NEEDS an option to disable them! 2. The game revolves around grinding cash then bribing both fractions at EACH gateway. Iâll go guns blazing next time?? But I think the diplomacy route is too tedious. 3. Personally the fleet you have at the end, IMO just isnât grand enoughâ¦  I kinda hope Iâll blast through this game again soon.  
1138	1	a	This game is â¥â¥â¥â¥ing awesome. No, really. Try the demo. Awesome tower defense gameplay coupled with great hack 'n' slash, burn 'n' bash combat.  If you think the demo is awesome, wait until you hear this: a little less than one third of the way into the campaign, you unlock the Weavers, performance enhancing mages who let you choose a tree of enhancements: your weapons, or your traps (this includes guardians and soldiers). Personally I'm a fan of the combat enhancements. With the double ended bladestaff, and all the melee enhancements, you'lll tear through the orc hordes like a hurricane of blood.   I've tried the Trap tree, but because both traps and the perks cost money, where as with the combat you only have to pay for the perks, I find that the trap tree often takes longer to upgrade, and even with the perks you'll often still have to depend on weapons a fair amount.  All in all, this game kicks â¥â¥â¥. Buy it.
3458	1	a	''Rule Britannia!'' ''Britannia rule the waves'' ''Britons never, never, never will be slaves''  Rewrite history, unite the world with Total War!
1559	1	a	Amazing! Truthfully the best game i have ever played!
1707	1	a	I have entered the point in my life where i just want Total War and Civilization to make sweet love in the form of making a game with combat like total war and the ability to advance through the ages of technology like Civ then like me play till my heart explodes thats all i ask. But..... Pro: its total war you will love it or you're wrong playing as britain makes half of europe hate you so you end up owning half of europe to stay alive fun looks good I'm too lazy to examine it further than that just watch gameplay on youtube who reads this stuff anyway Cons: I never get fighter jets :(
3923	1	a	One of my favorites and truly a gem in the Total War series of games. Refreshing break from the endless melee conflict of earlier eras. The Dutch can rule the world. Wooden shoes for ALL OF YOU!!!
712	1	a	A tower defense game mixed with RPG elements and a 3rd person perspective on your hero. A really enjoyable game where you are a young wizard defending the onslaught of orcs. You set up each mission by placing your 'towers' (in this games case, traps) to slow the orcs down. This is only your first line of defense as you control the young wizard once the round starts. Cast magic, go melee, fix traps, and much more.  I would recommend getting this game before purchasing the sequel. Sure the second one has two player co-op, but this will be cheaper and allow you to get a feel for the game. If you really enjoy the game and, like myself, find yourself wanting co-op play to add new deminsions and strategy, grab the second one. If you are quick, grab both games from Humble Bundle (as of this posting 12/10/13) and get both games, all DLC, for $4.25.  I highly recommend giving it a try. Watch the video/trailer to see if the playing style is what you are wanting too. If not, then don't waste your time because you will not be satisfied. If you are intrigued or thinking, 'yeah I will give it a try. looks fun!' then you should buy this right away.
2614	1	a	Most solid total war ever made, wish they would make a second one
3739	1	a	I conquered all of Europe and India as Poland. 10/10
1603	1	a	The year is 1721. I am commaning Sweden on a quest to unite the Baltic coast under one flag. I have already crushed Courland, Denmark, and Poland-Lithuania, and Prussia will soon fall. The government is as strong as ever, and with skilled generals at my side, nobody in Europe can stop me! Then, the Russians try and provoke a war by stationing troops near my border. But, their confidence will be their downfall. With my influence stretching from the most remote Norwegian peaks to the fields of Bohemia, I am a true empire!  10/10 best strategy game I have ever played.
3691	1	a	It is an amazing strategy game, and one of my favourite RTS games!  8/10 worth buying
1325	1	a	I've played Total War since Medieval II and ever since, this has been one of the finest. If you have been looking for a game that deals with the age of gunpowder and the political and diplomatic instability of the 1700s, look no further. Although more recent Total War games now have access to the Steam Workshop, Empire still has some amazing modders out there. This review is kinda short but lol okay... 8.5/10... Kinda buggy though at times
253	0	a	That was a nice game but boring as hell. Sequel is much better.
3845	1	a	asome game an stargety game 
4804	1	a	A universe that everyone should experience. The combat is oh-so-fun, it's got a nice progression formula that everyone knows and loves by now, some story, great controls, and a lot of heart.  If you haven't, make sure to play SPAZ, it's a really great product!
4891	1	a	Very nice space simulation game. Fun to play and easily makes you play for hours.
3171	1	a	This game is a very fun combat simulator, in which you actually feel like a general commanding your troops to victory. Or loss. This game gets really addicting at times and I reccommend it to everyone.
1273	0	a	I did not enjoy this game at all.
2531	1	a	Love the game with all the mods
2832	1	a	Rule an empire by land or sea, conquer your neighbors while turning your enemies against each other. Diplomacy and politics will run their course whilst your eyes are on the battlefield, and if you're not careful when you return to your captiol the government will have shifted. This game accurately portrays the state of affairs within a great empire, from internal disputes to armies on the campaign map to soldiers in the trenches. Keep your diplomatic officers close and your generals even closer, for once someone sets their eyes on your land, diplomacy is a concept to be scoffed at. Build your infrastructure, appease your people, and assemble your armies.   The world is waiting.   Victory and glory are within your grasp.  Your empire has gained its identity, and your people are prepared to fight for it.  The nations beyond are ready to fall...  All they need from you is a little push.  
3084	1	a	Great game for the series. In my opinion, the firearms makes for a more fun battle experience as compared to others in the series. (Shogun, Rome)
4076	1	a	Awesome game. Still play it today.
534	1	a	I found the game pretty addictive. It's a tower defense game with a wide variety of traps and weapons to choose from. Negotiate with orcs? No! Orcs Must Die!
1920	1	a	A great game.... you must have this! If you like to command an army or lead great charges then this game is for you!
1548	1	a	This game deserves praising!
4776	1	a	10/10.
666	1	a	Orcs Must Die! is a very enjoyable mix of the tower defense and third-person shooter genres with plenty of comedy mixed in. The objective of the game is to place traps in order to prevent waves of orcs from making their way through to your world. As you progress, you unlock more traps which you can also upgrade. Furthermore, you can supplement your traps by attacking the orcs directly.  I highly recommend this game. The gameplay and comedy are highly enjoyable. For those looking for a co-op experience, you'll want to check out Orcs Must Die! 2. Which as a bonus includes levels from Orcs Must Die! in addition to it's own, new, levels.
2739	1	a	On its own this game is nothing special but with mods it can be truly amazing.  The most crippling flaw in the game is the horrid blandness of the battlefields. You will never see a city in a land battle or a coastline in a naval battle.   If you can get past that though, it's a heck of a lot of fun to build a world-wide empire in the age of musket and fighting sail. As you can see by the hours I've logged on ETW, I enjoyed it quite a bit.
5248	1	a	Free roaming, trading, factions, and a wide variety of ships to command in your squad. One cannot ask for more from this game, hours of gameplay and a great variety of upgrades and weapons make this game unique and exhilarating.
3265	1	a	This game is â¥â¥â¥â¥ing awesome! I love how you can be in India, America, and Europe with just about anyone. And it's so unpredictable. â¥â¥â¥â¥ing love it!
4591	1	a	All kinds of Yes!
3001	1	a	Imperialist's wet dream
4195	1	a	What we gonna do to day : pinky,  Where trying to take over the world : brain
3766	1	a	Excellent representation of 18th century warfare and tactics. The graphics are way above average. The diplomacy and religious aspects are intriguing and can be both a blessing and a bane. The navial battles are as historically and mechanically accurate and well integrated with the land units. The spies and religious chacaters are unique and should be used extensively.  As a world history major, the research involved was immense and very well done.  Over all a good game... Play the tutorials first... maybe a few times. Beginners would be well to start with the English first and then experiment with others.  You will lose hours in play...  5 stars.
1672	1	a	Even for my pc the game is pretty heavy but the game is very fun to play with quite nice graphics and decent gameplay. The multiplayer is dead though.
1504	1	a	A step forward for the series, Empire still has some rathe obvious flaws that play-testing would have easily highlighted, including a lack of Swiss nation or even region and the insistance that some nations are Major and some Minor, that a single state United States is more important to the two state Venetians is sad. The DLC is pointless and overpriced, the game insists on a very European-centric perspective and the game does crash occasionally, but it is worth buying when on sale.
2875	1	a	Amazing game.........when it works
4495	1	a	Space Pirates and Zombies is a good old fasioned 2D space battle and exploration game with strrong ARPG elemements. While the story is somewhat shallow, the game universe is procedurally-generated and randomised, there's plenty of area to explore and conquer, although at times, it gets to be a bit of a grind, although if you're careful, you can reduce the amount of grinding necessary by trading with civilian stations. The tutorial is actually quite good and the game will stop and show you new mechanics as they come into play. Totally worth buying, I've sunk over 235 hours into this game, and I've enjoyed every minute of it.
390	1	a	Orc stomping fun!
2862	1	a	In this FPS, strategy, tower defense game you kill the british with the americans. Or you can â¥â¥â¥â¥ around in some silly billy stuff your willy mode with countries like Colombia, Peru and Hermandia you to can conquer your enemies. No but in all seriousness this game is really good.
3099	1	a	One of my favorite themes in the Total War series. The naval combat is superb and almost always play them out other than 'auto-combat.' This is definitely worth the money if you are into 18th Century combat and the Total War series.
4521	1	a	SPAZ is a fun space strategy game with nice graphics and satisfying gameplay. I recommend to anyone who likes the genre. 7/10
411	1	a	Before I had my own steam account, I played this game all the time on my brother's account. I loved playing this game, endless upon endless hordes of orcs slaughtered at the hands of an 8 year old.
456	1	a	Great fun for a few bucks, Probably shortlived but who cares for 10 euro? 1001 ways to kill a orc, you can probably find more :D
3901	1	a	Stoping the french revolution by making france english? yes please. Nazi Prussia taking over europe? yes please. An native american taking a â¥â¥â¥â¥. no just no       10/10 Amazing
4742	1	a	i played a lot of this game and its pretty good
4513	1	a	If you have fond memories of playing Subspace back in the day, but always wished the game had a single-player mode, SPAZ is the game for you.  A top-down shooter, your ships handle like the one from Asteroids, with thrust and momentum affecting your crafts as they goes flying across the battlefield. You have an entire squadron at your disposal, but can only directly control a single ship at a time. The others are handled by the AI, but you can and you swap between ships with the press of the button. Each ship can be upgraded or swapped out for different ones better suited to the challenges at hand.  Instead of flags and bases, the game pits your squadron against varieties of enemy ships. Your squadron jumps from system to system in the galaxy, mining for resources to upgrade your ships while completing different missions. There isn't too much variety in the gameplay, with most of the missions boiling down to 'blow up everything that isn't yours.' There is a story, too, but it is pretty thin.  I got a kick out of the game, mostly for the nostalgia of playing something similar to Subspace. The lack of variety and paper-thin story hurt the game, and give little reason to grind your way to finish. But for the price, it's fun while it lasts, and I'm hoping for a sequel or add-on that fleshes out the core gameplay further.
4127	1	a	A solid game that deserves a spot in the collection of every fan of the Total War series. Fans of grand strategy games should pick this up as well. Neither group will be disappointed.
4288	1	a	Really fun game I really recommend this.
1669	1	a	Not the Best Start to a Total War Game, but it's a really good one.
1214	1	a	Typical Tower Defence. There's not much I can say about this one. Good for a casual boring afternoon. I think it could be a good gift game but that about sums it up. 4.5/10
3743	1	a	First things first this game is fantastic, the grand campaign is amazing and the diplomacy is experianced and beast.  11/10 would get as a random accidental gift from a lithuanian!!!
1221	1	a	I don't know why but I love this game. When I don't feel like thinking much I load this up and play for a bit. Its a pretty generic tower defense game. I think I got it for $5 which I'd say its worth that, any more than that is pushing it.
2887	1	a	Great game with some technical problems.-90%
2833	1	a	Massive battles and stunning graphics! Naval clashes couldn't be better! One of the best history-based strategy games out there.
5019	1	a	My only suggestion is to play it on normal difficulty or easier, as the harder difficulties compound the problem with this game stretching into the bad end of the repetition scale. Still, with a host of ships to build and customize with many different attachments, it's fun to simply try out new combinations and strategies. The AI is competent enough, though exploitable (and your AI controlled ships are sometimes similarly stupid). This actually works in the games favor, however, IMO. Overall, the controls work great, there's lot's of customizability and skill that goes into your victories and defeats, and this game was made by 2 guys. I want to see what they can do next, personally, so I'd like to see them make some money to do so.
195	1	a	I've never had this much fun killing orcs!
3032	1	a	Genocide the french: the video game
2479	1	a	A wonderful game!
2316	1	a	I love this game so much i has put hundreds of hour into this game on anouther acount it is my second favrit total war game out of the lot and i would deffinitly recomend this.
1527	1	a	I only have 2 problems with this game, one of wich is my fault and could use some help with. Anyway my first problem is that getting technologies takes like 8 turns. The other wich i hope someone could put down and help me with, is whenever i go on the battlefield, my game crashes after a wile. There are multiple reasons for this, but it mostly is my computers fault. Besides this it is an Amazing game. I highly suggest it to all strategy gamers and hope you enjoy. 
3832	0	a	Great game, unnaceptable amount of crashes. game crashes just about every turn. Completely unnaceptable. I have a relatively new computer, a great internet connection and windows 7. No reason for this. I would recomend this game if only not for the game killing crashes. Save your money and dont buy this POS.
3624	1	a	I played the previous game for days in total i recon. And i love the new version its more complicated, more engrossing. Its the strategy game with political, military danger. 10/10
1122	1	a	fun tower defence game
2618	1	a	awsome game really!!
2595	1	a	Really great game if you are looking for a good 18-century battle/managment game
3580	1	a	One of the best RTS games
1906	1	a	India lost it's tea.   10/10
2912	1	a	A never ending game. I got 362 hours on record and still enjoy it.
3179	1	a	Love this game. Classic
183	1	a	Excellent Tower Defense with a 3rd person fighter twist. So addicting.
143	1	a	I had to stop because I had to click too much and it was annoying Chris on skype.
5115	1	a	You just dont find good games at a good price like this one. This game is 10 levels of EPIC GRAVY!!
1305	1	a	Marched my strongest men to the enemy walls, started to climb, all my men fall and die 10/10
4737	1	a	Great game! If you have the chance to gt this game and pass... well you just screwed yourself then!!
4534	1	a	Space Pirates and Zombies is addicting, funny, and exciting. The game was made by a small team of independant developers which did a wonderful job with SPAZ and this game definately has a lot of content for your money. When I was first playing the game, I often found myself saying, 'WHAT IS THAT?!' because some new giant ship had decided to turn its weapons against me. Thinking back, this game produces a nostalga now and again which brings me to play it even after beating it multiple times.   I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys platformers, sci fi, rockets, lasers, and strategy. I only have one problem with this game, that being its lack of multiplayer capabilities, but if you get passed that it is definately worth a buy.
852	1	a	The combination of tower defense action and kickass music is what makes this game awesome!
1189	1	a	I really do adore the disciples games but this game has issues that are very unfortunate when there is an area of the map you need to get to and just can't for some reason it's beyond annoying still a fun game
5219	1	a	It's fairly fun, the developers put way more content into this game, and it's a good value. Gameplay is reptitive, the story is ignorable, and there's going to be straight out grinding to get through the second half of the game. It will eat up dull hours though.
5119	1	a	I actually had a ton of fun playing this game, pretty simple to learn but there were some tough scenarios
409	1	a	A simple game with loads of fun and a whacky style. The title says it all ;-)
2677	1	a	Great strategic game! You just gotta have a great pc build to handle the game requirments to play it smoothly. I'm always down to play this game anytime.
3156	1	a	Mix TBS and RTS. Epic battles aroud world like America, Europe , Middle East or India. Build your own Emipire and overwrite a history!!
1199	1	a	It's not Disciples 2, but with some mods it can get really close!
319	1	a	This is probably my favorite iteration of tower defense, save for the sequel, because it takes what's too often a genre where it's an impersonal enemy grinder and forces you to be an active participant at all times. Combining traps is crazy fun when you get it right, and the game itself is irreverent in just the right doses to not be too winky or tiresome. Very solid, though the main campaign is almost a bit too long and difficult, and this game is hampered a little bit by the fact that the sequel surpasses it in a lot of ways, so if you're not looking to dive in too deep, just grab the sequel.
5022	1	a	Its an ok game. i downlaoded it when it was free to play one weekend. probaly one of the less expensive 'Simulator' games out there. its fun of you have nothing else to do
4283	1	a	Anybody likes strategy, This is THE Game
5034	1	a	This is a amazing game. I love it. The story line is just pure bliss.... can't wait for the second game of it.   Buy this game if you love to comit to games, love single player, and love huge fleets of destruction in space. Oh and zombies. :D  It took me 64 hours to complete the game, and thats just sticking with the story and not doing any of the secondary option, and there are TONS.  Over 2 years, I finished it. gg
2413	1	a	It's the best! I love it and I think that the creators should make a total war game about WW2. A problem I have is that the game slows down after the year 1800 and 1840. The game slows during the other player's turn while I waited. My advice is that you should play the game to where the extent is; on the panel where it says Prestige victory, short victory, long victory
1224	1	a	Ratings: 7.1/10  The game is fair enough to play. Unlike any other tower defense game. Just have built-in aspects of its' own and creativity. Not much to say as I would sometimes play when I have the time. Worth playing if you like tower defenses games, but this is the average.
277	0	a	I hate this.
3456	1	a	It's a fun game don't put battles on hard you will have a bad day. when playing dont trust the polish they are always out to get you.
485	1	a	It is a relly fun game ^-^
3030	1	a	GR8 love all the total war games but this is a hole new monster compared to rome
2482	1	a	i love this game with a burning pasion
5318	1	a	 For all the haters out there; Arma 3 does not have glitches or bugs, they are called features and we  love  them.
5123	1	a	Nice little game, a little toi much grinding but ok
4403	1	a	This game is addicting once you start, especially if you like strategy games and controlling units to fight other units.
2578	1	a	Good game. Very detailed and good strategy. Just one problem. Takes up waaaaaay too much space. It got uninstalled one day because of space.
2888	1	a	Hours and hours of strategy, action and management!
2368	1	a	i Like the game but i hate the game dont have a Workshop it could be awesome if i could download some Nations.
3590	1	a	The game is great but there are several glitches that cause the game to crash and one which prevented my campaign map from working at all. That last glitch affected the save file as well so my entire campaign was lost. Other than that it is a great game.
4747	1	a	The name of the game says it all.Your in the vastness of space trying to get by with your crew being forced to have to build urself a small armada to defend yourself.   The game has Ship building/customizing, research/upgrades,exploration,factions,great dialog (radio chatter). Fantastic atmosphere,lovely graphics,intense fights,challening AI, the works. And oh yea HAS frakking aliens that are pretty much as braindead as a zombie is that live on pure drive. Infected ships and other treats are all in the inner parts of the galaxy you happen to be in.  Yes there are space sectors of a galaxy you are in that you go through in the campaign.Like most Strat games the mission can be a bit repetitive but its the fights the make it worthwhile.
2700	1	a	If you like having 10 groups of 'mindless rabble' armed with pitchforks fighting against your groups of elite honor gaurd and massacring them, or having cannons armed with canister shots (turning the cannon into a giant shotgun) against militia men then this is the game for you.   10/10 would massacre helpless pitchforkers again
4468	1	a	If you love complex and inovative RTS games this is for you; however, there are still many draw backs that new buyers should be aware of. There is no support from the dev's anymore due to complex company issues, so there will never be anymore balance changes or ui updates. Servers go down quite frequently. The little community that is there is stong but gets no attention. Over all the game is really fun but not worth spending $40 on.
4909	1	a	Good 'Asteroids-like' shooter, but with lots of research, upgrades, and custimization. Can get a little repetative. but lots of fun. Gome goes through a few stages to increase variety.
4280	1	a	Great game has some lag at times but it is a good game over all only 54 hours in it but i know i will play it alot
4033	1	a	The Game Is Awesome:Totalwar
2549	1	a	More management in campaign if you compare to Napoleon, the combat is a bit slower but makes it rather interesting when you have played a lot of Napoleon or Shogun 2 :)
5066	1	a	This was a pleasant surprise of a space sim, in which the focus is as much on the 2D top-down space combat as it is on resource collection, faction negotiation/manipulation, and technology collection. It has a very RPG feel - as you gain experience and level, you place points into the systems of your ship that you most rely on, forcing you to always evaluate your strategy as there are MANY different systems to put points into, and the ships that you receive all use them differently.   I did not expect to get sucked into this game, nor did I expect it to last as long as it did. Be careful with this one - it can get addictive very quickly. And once you get going, it's going to carry you a lot longer than you'll expect. It does get too repetitive towards the end of the game, and a lot of that time was spent grinding out materials.   3 out of 5 foxes.

1319	1	a	Play as glorious Holland Take all Western Europe and then all of India 10/10 would VOC again
539	1	a	Tower defense with humor and an attitude. The music keeps pumping, orcs keep coming and you have a growing arsenal of traps and weapons to keep them at bay. Lots of fun!
3872	1	a	The only downside to this game? It takes patience. Lots and lots of patience. If you're like me and only play the grand strategy part of it, you'll be subject to long load times and lots of waiting (enough to make minimizing it and watching some YouTube a viable option). Otherwise, everything about this is great, making it my favorite game of all time. My favorite part is by far the sense of progression. As your Empire grows and advances, and you get better and more unique units (and buildings and other options) as the game progresses. The graphics are also still great for an older game. Every gameplay element is solid, from colonizing to battles. You will not be disappointed.
916	1	a	Tower defense meets FPS, really fun.
2002	0	a	I got this as part of a bundle. The rest of the total war bundle is pretty good. Shogun 2 has its issues and medieval 2 has a couple of bugs, and rome is perfect.  Empire, on the other hand, doesn't even qualify as a finished product. Within minute one of any given battle you will see soldiers moonwalking in place, units inexplicably forming into single file lines to march around the battlefield, clumsy, weightless 'animations' that somehow manage to feel less violent than even the very rudimentary moves of rome (probably because the only sound effect in the game is the sound of gunfire/cannon fire (!)), and unit models that manage to be less detailed than medieval 2's and debatably less detailed than Rome's. The campaign map is bloated with 'features' that mostly serve to reduce player agency-No manual recruitment of agents would be the cardinal example of this.  Oh, and all written information in the game is in, at a rough estimate, eight-point font.  Empire is honestly a depressing 'game', all the more so because of how much of an omen it turned out to be for the direction the Total War series turned out to go. It's chilling that somebody looked at this game, presumably played it for ten minutes, and then said, 'Yes, this is a finished product.'
2234	0	a	You can download it on mac but u cant play multiplayer whith windows users and there are only few mac users so u cant almost never play multiplayer if u dont have friend with mac so- IF YOU HAVE MAC DO NOT BUY THIS GAME COSE YOU CAN ONLY PLAY SINGLE but it is pritty cool game and it is my fault i have mac and not normal PC as everybody esle but if u did the same mistake and bought mac do not download this game thanks
2339	1	a	Best turn based strategy game on the market. It is very tactical and really makes you think. 9/10
953	1	a	Hilarious game pretty much the best part is what the guy is saying. He keeps the mood light so I'm not gnashing my teeth on those hard levels. Buy if you're into FPTower defense things
1930	1	a	This is my favorite game of all time!!! I love eveything about this game! The battles are fun, and I love the campaign. There are a few bugs here and there, but it is a great game! It's even better when you get mods for it! 10/10
1003	1	a	wow what a good game
3189	1	a	love this game, but theirs only one problem. The game lags alot and runs slowly, I'm even running it in low quality but the game still runs slow. Any suggestions that may help making it run faster? other than my problems, the game is great. 10/10
1037	1	a	Orcs Must Die is an incredibly fun, fast paced tower defense game with emphasis on action. You play a War Mage just out of his apprentice training, who must stop orcs from reaching the rifts into your world.  With your old master dead, a cocky attitude, and not the greatest intelligence your kind has ever seen. The world is surely doomed.
3251	1	a	The best Total War game, period! Yes Napoleon TW has seasonal attrition which is the only feature that is missing from this game, which lets face it should have been included as a patch. The sheer scale of this game, combat across the Americas, Europe and India it cannot be matched. Having played the disappointments that were Shogun 2 and more recently Rome 2, I always seem to gravitate back to Empire, its mix of naval and land battles were near prefect. It still makes we look on in awe when an enemy ship of the line explodes after a furious broadside exchange.
378	1	a	Hilarious! A must buy for anyone who likes Bruce Campbell films or Duke Nukem!  The extra missions that you can buy are also good but lack the hilarious storyline and the new traps you get seem a bit too powerful.  The follow up game Orcs Must Die 2 is terrible! Don't waste any money on it.
4112	1	a	It's a good game, but gets boring after a while, it's like Civilization but, more detailed in the combat.
1472	1	a	its pretty strategic, but when u capture countries it gets very fun. buy it
3283	1	a	You like 17th century? You like gun powder, horses and tricornes? You like turn based strategy and big bad up to 10k units in a single battle? If you answer was yes for any one, this is THE definitive game for you! A must OWN!
851	1	a	Damn, this game is fun. I'd play a lot more Tower Defense if there were more like thisâ just the right balance of strategy and fast-paced action, especially on Nightmare difficulty; also, the dumb humor hits just the right note.
3760	0	a	i cant get it to start 
2126	1	a	Total crap. The only reason I still have this is that it is bound to my steam account. Do not buy it for any reason.
2691	1	a	Play it... Love it
4017	1	a	Itâs a fine effort and I appreciate the scope, but personally I think Napoleon: Total War is the superior game. Unless you really want to battle it out in India or the Americas Iâd suggest you pick up Napoleon instead.
3311	0	a	i dont know if im just a huge idiot or what but i hate the combat in this game so so much
1962	0	a	I'm not going to write a complex review likve I've done before. I'll just say this; Empire is a good game, with good mechanics, a good environment, and a good theatre of war. The problem with Empire is that it's dying. Napoleon has basically rendered this game obsolete since it just expands on this game but brings in new things and slightly better land and naval combat. Therefore I cannot recommend this game since there is a successor. However, if you like to fight on different fonts, this game is good. Just keep in mind that it is fairly buggy.
4539	1	a	Now this, ladies and gentlemen, is a piece of work. It's got an interesting storyline that surprises you with not exactly plot twists- but... surprises. I was using some awfully small ships when I encountered a group of extremely large enemies coincidentally sitting right where an object I need to grab is. I was told to take them out. With difficulty I finished the job. Now, that may seems insane, but when you learn how the CPU ships are going to try to attack you, you'll set your ships to different modes to make use of their evasive moves and such. This game is great, there is a ton to do, from persuading people you're on their side to blowing up bases. Before you know it, you'll have played so much (if you like it as much as me and my friends do) you'll go from taking out a weak Dart ship to blowing up Lvl 3 Bounty Hunter Bases. There's always somewhere to go to upgrade your gear or to open warp gates and such. Fun game. 9/10
2976	1	a	This game is by no means as good as rome 1 or medieval 2 but overall when weighed against rome 2 its not bad.And I personally dont think it derserves as much â¥â¥â¥â¥ people give it dam sure deserves some.Overall 6/10 as it is now for twenty dollars.
3610	0	a	Unfinished, unpolished, horrible AI. Avoid unless you heavily mod it. I felt cheated, big time.
5049	1	a	I was blown away by how awesome this game is! It piqued my interest because it looked vaguely similar to a game I used to play in my younger years (Inner Space, look it up!) but I was not prepared for the awesomeness contained within. This game is my new addiction, I can't get enough of it! The upgrade system is stellar, the different ships and upgrades are varied and lend to an amazing assortment of strategies, suited for multiple play styles. The reputation system within each system independant of each other means you can have fun and not screw up what you were doing in another place. I just love it. I can't wait for #2 now!
3094	1	a	With Civ 5 very much on the build and expand side of an imaginary scale, Empire: Total War really goes the other direction. It does have building, but you will know that it's just tedious chores with the appearance of building an empire, when you really just want to put on your Generel's cap. So Empire: Total War really goes to the other side of the specturm, towards the conquer and combat side. It may enchant you, it might also just bore you to death.
383	1	a	Fantastic blend of action and Tower Defense. Best one I've seem in this genre yet. Can last very long if the player is at least a little bit perfectionist. Also, this game gets bonus points from me for not taking itself too seriously. It even comes packed with cheesy hurmor and a lovable goofy protagonist.
4188	1	a	hours of game play and plenty of replay value
4787	1	a	Just got this game over the xmas sale. I've really impressed with it! Great fun, a bit of a challenge, and it'll offer hours of good fun.
4595	1	a	What isn't fun about flying around and blowing stuff up?  This game is fun, but gets a bit repetitive.
655	1	a	Just plain simple gory fun
2074	0	a	I try starting the game but nothing pops up and then it goes back to where it says I'm not playing it. Nothing is working. Broken game. Refund.
4046	1	a	The fact that I can play this on my potato laptop is a thumbs up in my book
3974	1	a	Simply put I love this game! This was my introduction to Total war games in general and I was blown away. The game was rather glitchy on release back in 2011, yet it has been constantly patched and updated and it is a brilliant turn based historical strategy game set in the 1700s. If you like strategy with large scale battles added in then this game is for you. The single player map is hugeee, including Europe, North America and India. There are many different factions and units to choose from, you are spoilt for choice really. I know some still prefer the older Rome or Shogun 2 etc etc but this is and always will be the one for me. I like to play on the multiplayer servers from time to time which are getting smaller and smaller but you still find a few keen players who can give you a good challenge and waste a few hours away. 10/10 just for the memories.
4458	1	a	One of the best RTS games ever!
100	1	a	who wants more traps? I do! I do!
3560	1	a	Without the Darth Mod, an excellent game, at times a bit buggy, but I blame Sega pushing a release for the bugs. With the Darth mod, the game feels finished, and for me is the best in the series. Won't compare it to any of the others because they're all a bit different. Buy it, because ruling the world never gets old.
5116	1	a	Its so fun, dropped many fun hours into it. Hiughly recommend, there should be more of these games.
1415	1	a	-Plays vanilla game and enjoys it thoroughly. -Discovers Darthmod UC -immerses self in 18th century warfare for days on end -plays as Britain, conquers, rule britannia. -plays as Prussia, conquers, Preussens Gloria -plays as Saxony, gets frustrated and quits by turn ten... 9/11  I â¥â¥â¥â¥ing live for this game  (I have over 400 hours on this game, steam doesn't record time using darthmod)
2596	1	a	Best game of the Total War Series, except for Attila for I have not played it yet. Mechanics are great, sea battles are intense, and the scale is amazing. 9/10
4647	1	a	Action game with significant RPG like progress system.  You control one ship of 2-4 ship group. The other ships follow yours around, you outfit all of your group with shields, weapons, engines etc. that you unlock as you progress.  I found significant time spent farming was required, although the combat is the heart of the game, so that wasn't too big a problem.  The story is nothing special. Graphics are fine for an indie game. This game is for those looking for a spaceship squad based ARPG.
5251	1	a	Deceptively simple in nature though with scale comes complexity. If you enjoy seeing your ships grow in size and fire power, this is an extremely fulfilling experience.
1914	1	a	Very good first Musket Era Warfare for the total war series. Love modding it and also there are alot of goodies in this :)
4062	1	a	It's a very good game, at least it kept me in school for a little while longer.
5074	1	a	Apart from extremely long start of game loading time, SPAZ is overall a fun top-down 4X game. Customisation is cool, but also feels like once you die (and if you keep dying) you'll be reset back to square one. Forcing you to mine for very small mineral patches and do low level jobs just to get enough to build you crazy expensive ships. Cheap game, so value for money - 6/10
1814	1	a	There is no game that i've played so much for so long, just so awesome!
2358	1	a	Started a empire as Britain. A native american tribe attacked some of my trading posts in America. I decided to take over and destroy every village belonging to that tribe, Then had every native american tribe in america attack my capital city    11/10 would never â¥â¥â¥â¥ with native americans again
3791	1	a	Brilliant game, the depth exceeds the previous Total War titles by leaps abound. The somewhat cartoony approach to history that the older games featured has been done away with for a much more serious feel, and it's pulled off very well; even if it isn't perfectly historically accurate, compared to previous games it is apples and oranges. This is not only by far the best Total War game to date, it may very well be the best strategy game in recent years. Yes, the game was released with bugs, but I don't feel that the game itself can be rated based on bug issues. Some people are giving it low scores because they are frustrated with bugs, but I prefer to rate based on content. It might be worth waiting a month or two past release, but the fact is that it runs more than playably for most people, and the bugs will get ironed out. Also, for other people, please stop rating games based on their performance.
3232	1	a	This game is a great Total War, though perhaps not the best of all. In my experience, it redefines the pretty structured systems of previous Total War games, instead moving away from strong Heavy Infantry based armies, to range warfare (obviously). Any of you who have played Total War games before (except Napoleon or Empire itself) will find that your previous strategies that could be transferable from say Rome to Medieval, will not apply here. Instead of totally relying on infantry, you will find yourselves using Cavalry and Artillery more in your strategies (although every General has a different play style, this is what I experienced).  The Campaign map is stunning, and although the extra cotton farms and things promise to redefine how attacking a province works, it dosen't that much, you only get the effect of blockading ports as with previous Total War games. Also, players new to strategy games will find the huge campaign map quite daunting, but the Road to Independence campaign is the best Intro/Tutorial game of any Total War I have played.  The Naval Battles are incredibly challenging, especially as I had only played up to M2TW before this, you are literally thrown into the deep end (albeit with a tutorial), and this is a good thing, it brings into light the importance of navies at the time. Players new and old will enjoy them. The visuals are absolutely stunning, sometimes even on the lower Graphic settings (for huger battles), I was still awestruck at the beautiful scenery in the game, although performance does drop if you have smoke on higher settings, but it is bearable. However, despite the massive change in time period and combat style, in terms of Total War games, it isn't that revolutionary. Some may find this to be a bad thing, but in my experience it just refines the Total War experience as a whole, instead of completely flipping the engine and changing things completely, they build upon their already large success. Summary: + Outstanding gameplay, typical of any Total War game. + Outstanding visuals, your eyes will not be dissapointed. + Redefines the already successful Total War formula, adding systems like the Tech Tree (which you personally may or may not like, I did) - Not that much variation between factions, other than starting position in the campaign. - Performance isn't as steady as I would like, especially on lower end machines 9/10
2743	1	a	ESRB rating was inaccurate for this game Buy it Get the DLC, Play the damn game, 10/10
2940	1	a	An overall great game. Too bad my micro management is â¥â¥â¥â¥ and I can't plan attacks. Still fun.
3207	1	a	very good game but poor about technical knowledge
602	1	a	This game is HIGHLY addicting. If you're a fan of Tower Defense games then this is for you. You just want to see Orcs getting slaughtered by the thousands!!!
877	1	a	an awesome tower defense that has you killing countless orcs in over the top ways you can shoot them burn em melt them crush em how ever you want to do it and the game has humor and personality and its just over the top fun to play this game and its only 15$ as of the time of this review so if your a fan of tower defense games or some one who loves indie games you should give this game a try
1144	1	a	Orcs Must Die!, another game I got AFTER the 2nd in the series.  Guess what?  I'm doing it wrong.  But anyway, great story with amazing voice acting, especially the effects of the sorceresse's voice. Another Gr8 r8 8/8 m8. Thx! :D
444	1	a	Single-player FPS Tower Defense Game. Pick it up when on sale. Easy fun!
4262	1	a	This game is the best genocide simulator I have played since Prison Architect
3929	1	a	Great game
4099	1	a	This game by far was one of the best total war games after the first Rome total war. Highly recomended
4566	1	a	â Really cool space adventure game, with freedom of choice and lots of neat features. â Pretty graphics â Well animated â Good game mechanics â Linux support!
1440	1	a	Great game, needs multiplayer campaign.
2990	1	a	I find Empire Total War to be one of the best games in the series. The reason for this is the huge world, the many factions, and the immense tech tree. No other Total War game rewards you for advancing your tech tree as Empire Total War does. It just feels amazing going from single firing muskets to gatling guns and missiles.
4990	1	a	Really simple and really addictive gameplay. You aren't going to get lost in the mechanics of it, the controls are easy but again, super addictive!
1647	1	a	Many total war players don't like this game because they complain that it's too easy and buggy as hell, but I like it because its the only one where the naval combat actually works.... and I like ships. If you are going to play this game 'Darth Mod' is a must
2193	0	a	Terrible terrible game, bugs make it unplayable glad i bought it on sale burned less money.
4396	1	a	I have played TW series since the first shogun I have played every song one this is probably the best definitely in my top 3  10/10 would pillage the world again
3286	1	a	From story, era of game, diplomacy options etc. the best of all 'Total War' games. The game mechanics is less dynamic than the preceeding titles, but the long-term motivation really equalizes that downpoint. More than worth playing!
4136	1	a	Empire has the best map and worst UI
2764	0	a	Total War is one of the most popular and best strategy game series around. A series that has tackled many time periods and settings such as the Roman Empire, Medevial, and Greece. It is not suprising that they tried to bring the series to the ever popular 1700s European setting. While games such as Age of Empire 3 thrived in this era, Total War falls apart.   Pros: well there really aren't any. Any thing positive I can say for this game, other games in the series do better.   Cons: well for one, the game is HORRIBLY optimised. I can max out Total War: Shogun 2, a newer game, but even on the lowest settings this game lags... on the campaign map. That's right, this game has issues smoothly running the WORLD MAP! Admitingly, Total War's campaign maps have always been more detailed than other series, trying to make the map look somewhat like an actual overview of the real world area, but still there isn't that much going on there. This problem is even worse in combat, where even the smallest battles can slow you down. God help you if there are more than about 10 units on screen at a time. The AI is AWFUL. Not only do your opponates have no sense of self-preservation, but your own units struggle to follow even your most basic commands. Trying to get units to hide behind cover confuses them more than just about anything. Also, the whole point of Total War games is formation based combat. While this works wonderfully in the pre-gun eras, here it is painful. All you have to do is line your troops up and wait for the enemy to come to you. Thanks to the poor AI they will walk straight up to you and not even bother to flank or surround and only load their guns when they are in range of your units. This means that often times your side can get 2 volleys into them before they fire back. This basically ruins any real sense of pride in your victory because it's borderline forced apon you. You have to try if you want to lose a battle. However, things are differnet in the world map. Here, your enemies watch you, and do a good job of taking undefended bases. This is the only time the game feels like it truly is a Total War game. Unfortunatly, it is drug down by making the diplomacy system laugable at best. Does a country hate you? Don't worry, all you need to do if gift them 10000 gold or so and they'll love you! Diplomacy has always been the weakest part of Total War games, but here it doesn't even really count as diplomacy. It really feels like you're in preschool and some kid hates you so you give him a gummybear and now you're friends. It's pathetic in every sense of the word. On TOP of all this, the game is broken, with units glitching through walls, units randomly not shooting (even when they have ammo and can hit their targets), and sometimes just ignoring your commands.   TL:DL- Total War is an amazing seires, don't let this awful game trick you into thinking otherwise. Do yourself a favor and pick up Shogun 2 or Rome 1. I've tried many mods and even worked on it myself and in the end it's still a broken mess. It's not quite the Sonic '06 of strategy, but it isn't too far off from that.
1104	1	a	Great game. Has enough trap/weapons to make replaying levels interesting by trying different strategies each time. Character dialog is funny.
1524	1	a	;
4951	1	a	Four words: space pirates and zombies. Enough said. Or maybe not quite enough said. This game is more fun than you can ever imagine.
3217	1	a	A fantastic game. Great grand campaign length, probably the best engineered campaign of the series. However, I find the character/agent interaction a tad lackluster. Regardless, this game is worth it.
3188	1	a	Great game!!!
1680	1	a	One of the best games I've ever played 
3696	1	a	To the person who said 'This game is Civilization for grown-ups', you almost got it right.  In reality, this game is Civilization for people who enjoy deeper combat. While playing this game you'll find the resource gathering and strategic land grabbing to be the flying buttress to the combat cathedral. I call it that because as strategy games go, Empire Total War has no rival.   The combat is engaging and immersive. You have two forms as well, naval and land. As you develop more technologies and research more manuvers, the game only gets better.   The only cons are the lack of control over resources and the annoying movement cinematics you can't seem to disable.  The aesthetics are quite beautiful. The classical music soundtrack with gregorian monks set a nice stage for a bloody interlude.   Overall: buy it!
690	1	a	I did not expect this to be anywhere near as stupidly fun as it is!
1903	1	a	This is I believe the most massive of all the TW campaign maps, and it can take an eternity to achieve victory. You should know the deal. Stealing technology is a sweet feature unique to this one, and I would probably buy it just to see the uniforms, they look incredible and there are hundreds of different units.   9/10 Take it slow on the warmongering, this is not Shogun
2177	1	a	Very enjoyable game, great fun. Features great singleplayer. One issue is that fortress combat seems a little... broken, and naval battles can be a little clunky, but apart from that, solid game.
2666	1	a	Great start for the new generation of Total War!
3011	1	a	
374	1	a	Really nice Tower Defense Game, that let's you take a very active fighting role, if you want! Don't make the mistake of thinking: 'meh, another TD game'!
1826	1	a	There are negatives to this game but so many more positives, it's may Fav of the total war series and I hope that they make EMPIRE 2, it's been a long time waiting.
5321	1	a	The best and one of the kind military simulator, with unprecedented tactical depth and wide array of additional features, like:  - Accurate ballistics &amp; penetration simulation  - Good range of vehicles to choose from  - No 'story rails' and total freedom of choice in sandbox environment  - Barely surpassed weapons/gear customization  - Greatest community out there with quality mods/addons Worth its cost on 300%
5092	1	a	Good game. Old school space strategy/action.
4683	1	a	I have played this game for over 100 hours. I reformatted my computer to get away from it. Try it!
358	1	a	It's a fun game, lots of ways to kill things!
3176	1	a	This game is loads of fun. Only complaint is that it has getting old, but then again I have been playing for over 300 hours.
4050	1	a	Sometimes i load up my very first game as Prussia and look at my amazing Prussian world and go ... you know what ima raise taxes in mexico so they can rebel. then make peace give them money and then 20 years later dispacth my legions and destroy mexico. then cry because i own the worlds again and feel lonely
1632	1	a	the battles on this game are really fun, and the campaign is interesting. you can play different countries, with different units to switch things up. downside is that multiplayer doesn't include a strategy mode, so no long campaign against your little brother in a different state, just have to settle for beating him in a battle instead of completely ruining his empire
3256	1	a	Extremly fun stratgey simulator with action, stragtgey, and diplomacy all in one.
402	1	a	'I really like the game, but I couldnât find the stupid cake.' a lot of fun with these game
3316	1	a	I am a huge fan of the Total War series, and this game still brings an amazing challenge. Graphics are awesome, gameplay is more complicated than previous Total War games, but is very rewarding when you succeed. All that stuff. lol.   Anyway, I rate this game a 9.5/10. It was pretty much completely awesome.
4655	1	a	Great mix of dogfighting action and strategy, with RPG elements and a fair amount of flexibility without being overwhelming. The 'fleet' of ships you pilot is greatly overstated though. I was disappointed when I found that I still only had access to 4 ship hangars at the end of the game.
774	1	a	An instant classic. Shame it's only single player - we hope that OMD 2 will have a coop feature.
5101	1	a	Get wiped out entirley and spend 30 mins farming asteroids before you can attack again. 10/10.
3836	1	a	This game caters to many different things: trade, military tactics, and diplomatic means. to conquer not only the European world, but the America's and India. Great game, as are all Total War games, with great historical acuracy, that is if that is how you want to play it.
789	1	a	great game, just smash zombies in many ways, 10 out of 10 :)
2386	1	a	Total War is one of my favourite game series. This game, with it's beautiful looks, was the icing on the cake.
189	1	a	Orcs Must Die, what are you waiting for? buy the game, or no, hold on, now that hte second one is out buy the second one.
911	1	a	Orcs Must Die! GOTY Edition: BRILLIANT! Quippy one-liners, squishy orcs; what more can you ask for? For the extra Â£3, it's worth getting the GOTY version. It's a 2Gb download, which might take a few hours; but worth it. Graphics: good. Voice acting: Good (the one-liners are quite funny). The game is GOOD! A great defence game. GET IT! 
1896	1	a	Everthing is gerat.Except for spain and russia on my campain.Russia declared war on me 8 times so far and spain 2.My only wish is that you can play as all of the countries.Otherwies everthing is great
4135	1	a	Earth shattering.
5169	1	a	my favorite indie game. more people should buy it
1954	1	a	Lets begin by saying that Napoleon: Total War is better if you are not willing to mod this game. N:TW is basically what Empire was supposed to be. Cost an extra game's worth :(   See, E:TW was 'broken' into service. Originally so badly launched that you couldn't even play it until a week after release, it was patched over, and, over, this bug, that bug, and after a time, CA just said 'Damn, GG. Next game :('   So what's that make it now? The best Total War ever, ironically. Top three at least. Read on and see how this catastrophe turned into a miracle.  History: After a long time, post - N:TW release, the head dev of CA came out and said something along the lines of (paraphrasing) 'E:TW was just beyond the scope of what we were capable of' and just gave all the deepest dev tools over to the mod community. Damn, E:TW looked so good in previews! I honestly was rooting for them all the way - this was gonna be a showstopper. But, we got more than we bargained for.   See, guns were a massive step from medieval2 combat. Things were going to be different and people were stoked! But the AI wasn't quite there to match the era yet. For example,   -the AI for properly lining a unit and properly zerging with a axes are two separate war principles -the economy of traditional units versus guns. Sorry horses - start of point and shoot warfare -AI could not manage artillery based combat AT ALL. Oh yes, in RL they shelled people down until they did something, it's a legitimate tactic. Pretty sure firing into hills is not. -some new features like research. If 2 schools beat the AI, it wasn't ready for players to go like, 8  +Naval combat. First time ever! Ironically, this was the most polished AI and in major engagements it was okay. But when you realized it just chases it was so abusable. A 6th rate could sink the Spanish Armada solo by simply running alot and maintaining distance.  But... the scale of the world, man! Gone were the days of Europe, you now manage an Empire. Multi-map, continental combat. The Earth itself. Yet, that was too grand a step for CA. Some serious design flaws led to, once again, easily abusable tactics that needed patches. Ex. The AI 'originally' couldn't figure out how to land armies. If you were Britain you won the game, besides the OP start position you had in the world. No attempts to make a multimap game have occurred since Empire: Total War, from this time of writing. All evidence of an 'exterior world' lies on beacons or map icons representing the rest of wherever, and you send a unit to sit on it like some couch potato. In Empire, you sent a freaking army, on your navy, D-day style. Oh hell yes!  Luckily, like an Elder Scrolls mod community, E:TW's fans took the work into their hands and have many ways to polish this game into a true gem. Like rebuilding a classic car, not every '69 Fastback you can get comes in mint condition, and with the Karate Kid focus of many Empire fans, This Game is a Proper Addition to the Total War series.   Thumbs Up. So before you go autobuy N:TW, consider E:TW plus a megamod. Something like DarthMod Ultimate Commander to this. Get the same-ish game for less, but with a polished AI, bug fixes galore, and so much more potential for mischief.  Will the Inuit overwhelm the fledgling United States and invade France, causing a power struggle in Europe? Have you ever seen how big a Pirate armada can become if left unchecked? Will Britain win like always again because it has Jamaicans, or are Dutch coffee shops more powerful? All this and more inside :D
1365	1	a	This is honestly one of the best strategy games I have ever had the pleasure of playing. Though it is buggy at times, the shear detail and historic aspect are truly great
1773	1	a	Total War's first foray into an age other than one of swords and bows, Empire, like much of this franchise, is a flawed gem. Being their first real go with armies that predominatly use guns, the AI work is sloppy and it really shows. It's pathetic how easy it is to expoit the AI's failings in battle and win yourself crushing victories that you shouldn't have gotten. It's also the first shot at naval combat, which functionally works better but still seems to generate complaints. Personally I blame that on a lack of knowledge about how to use warships in the age of sail in a fight more than anything else (hint: cut the enemy's battle line). Lastly, the diplomatic AI has a rather predictable habit of delivering you unpredictable war declarations. For example I was minding my own business as the French carving up North America for myself when I got war declared on me by the Marathas (India). Before too long they were landing armies in the Carribean and harassing my trade fleets. Why? I still have no idea, but it sure didn't help them when I dropped my huge armies fresh from American conquest into India. But damn was that war annoying when it started.  So what's the good? The map is -huge-, and the number of choices for nations to play is considerable (Though most are European). In other words... replay value is in abundance here. And that's really all it needs, to be honest. A game like this is made for being replayed and ending up in various differing situations. And it is here that this game shines. Otherwise it's a mixed bag.  What i'm trying to say is that this game is pretty decent, but you might not want this to be the first game in the series you try. It might sour your opinion and lead you to not looking into the other, arguably better or at least less flawed, entries into the series. But, this does have huge replay value. You will get alot of playtime out of this. If that's what you are looking for, then that might be all you need to have the pros of this game outweigh its problems.
3693	1	a	Very enjoyable game but it would be funner if you could please reopen the multiplayer
1589	1	a	1. Play as Prussia with all the unti DLCs (in total all DLCs are like 12ish dollars, in the US atleast, which is decent) 2. declare war on all divided german states etc Saxony, Wertumberg, Hannover, the UP, the Rhineland and Bavaria. 3. by declaring war on bavaria and saxony, France, Austria and Poland join into the war effort against you 4. its now prussia versus half of the euorpean world 5. march across saxony, hannover and bavaria in 6 years and annex them for the glorious Reich 6. reunite Austria and Prussia by right of war, currently now 6 german states are united. 7. with france pressing into the western front deploy the majority of ur force in the east and annexx poland 8. spain and russia get butthurt and declare war on my Reich 9. the western front crumbles, and the eastern shatters 10. reform into a republic and try to buddy buddy up to everyone after my leader dies. 10/10 would create my own Reich again, you can even reform the british into the new roman empire and get some glory, there are some many options, stop debating GET THIS GAME IMPORTANT IMPORTANT IMPORTANT: you can NOT cheat in this game as in Rome 1, Medival total war, etc etc, you CANNOT CHEAT IN THIS GAME REMEMBER THAT. now enjoy
1513	1	a	This is a good strategy game, but for those of you who've not played any total war games previously, I recommend playing the game on easy mode. This is because there are a lot of faction who are able to gang up on you.  This game allows you to pick a faction and command their army. You can create a larger economy, and thus a bigger army to expand your operations.  You are able to partake in diplomatic relations to create trade deals and allies. Alternatively, you can use this feature to bribe your way out of 'sticky' situations, or you can even use it to declare war on another faction.  I would give this game a 7 and a half out of 10.  The above score would be higher if there were not a few flaws within this game, such as the unbalanced auto-resolve feature, and a few other things I can't be bothered to remember. 
924	1	a	Beautiful indie game, if a indie company can make this and charge only 15 dollars, it proves the mass market gaming industry is â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up. This game plays smoother, looks better, and is more fun than most of the crap being released today. did i mention its only 15$ compared to what? 60$ for a average game? 9/10 (-1 point cause they say infinite replayability, but thats only cause of a leaderboard, if it had a survival mode it would be 10/10 definately)
431	1	a	Put down some traps and rip thousands of orcs apart in this awesome game. Not exactly tower defence, but its something similar.
1484	1	a	Step 1. scroll up step 2. add to cart step 3. BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2157	1	a	'Shoot straight ya â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s!' That saying pretty much summarizes the whole style of warfare which is seen in this astonishing game.This is one of CA more ambitious title for its time going for the traditional melee combat to 'modern warfare'  In this game you can choose between multiple factions including of course the more traditional one such as the French or British.However,less common factions which unique warfare tactics are also available like the Ottomans for example with its fearsome sword bearing janissaries or the Marathas deploying its heavy cavalry.  To sum it all up the game is great and a must have for any war fanatic. 
2632	1	a	TO MANY BUTTHURT AI -900000/10
146	1	a	Good strategy game, nice set of traps and skill to play with. levels and be completed in different ways to get most points or just to have fun, tho on normal story can be completed in 3 hours.
2410	1	a	this game is very good it represents the era of this time.
2076	1	a	Empire total war, so much to do so little time. A good addition to the Total war series which I love but not the best. A few bugs here and their but all in all if you like the histoical background of the colonial era then this indeed worth a try. 6/10
1377	1	a	Multiplayer is amazing. Nothing better than multiple armies firing muskets at each other, while cannon shots whizz overhead, and mortar and rockets blast the ground around them to shreds. 11/10
2914	1	a	Best Campaing in total war series, although the battles and units versality could be better (There are DLCs fixing the latter).
3533	1	a	if not the best strategic game, then one of the best!!! ;)
1794	1	a	Empire Total Warâ¢ begins in 1700 AD, the age of musket and cannon and exploration. Whatâs special about Empire Total Warâ¢, it now features three large maps and four small maps; the large maps show âAmericaâ, âEuropeâ and âIndiaâ, the small maps contain the locations: âBrazilâ, âS.W. Africaâ, âMadagascarâ and around the âJava Seaâ. Like all Total Warâ¢ games, the series consists of different nations that reside in the continents the games are based, but now you can experience playing as new nations or factions that the series has not featured before (In the âAmericaâ and âIndiaâ maps): the âMaratha Confederacyâ (India), âMughal Empireâ (India), âCherokee Nationsâ (America), âPueblo Nationsâ (America) and much, much more.  The game features special events that occurred within the century itâs based (The Thirteen Colonies, the French Revolution, the beginning of the United States of America etcâ¦), the game now features a âTechnology Treeâ, it provides improvements and upgrades of buildings in all different professions (Agriculture, Industry, Military etcâ¦); the game also features politics, whether youâre a republic or a monarch nation, you can choose or change any minister of the cabinet who you do or donât like, or swap two ministers from their possession on the cabinet. Like Medieval Total Warâ¢ to Rome Total Warâ¢, there were many changes made within the graphics, system of the campaigns, movement of the soldiers and the intelligence of different nations, like the big change from those games, Empire Total Warâ¢ was the next jump after Medieval II Total Warâ¢.  This game stands out to me personally because of the generation itâs based: The different continents it features and the unique soldiers it contains; the time of the red jackets, Imperial conquest, nation expansion around the New Colonies and in the far east; also learning, enlightenment, culture and industry. The game now has a new way to how the soldiers move and fight (bayonet or sword), instead of moving a regiment of infantry or cavalry though a forest and getting stuck around the trees, Empire now doesnât have that problem, and if one unit of that regiment gets stuck or falls behind, the soldier will catch up. On the campaign map, you can now move multiple armies, navies or agents all at once instead of moving them one at a time. You can now trade in the small map regions but you must avoid pirates from attacking your ships. You must also be careful on taxing or cultural differences on places you take over, constant oppression can lead to strikes, riots and rebellions. This game to me is 10 out of 10, it marks the time of enlightenment, discovery and exploration within the colonies.
4782	1	a	I liek getting spaced out.
949	1	a	This game is AWESOME. Extremely well-polished singleplayer experience full of humor and fun.  The art, the audio, the gameplay, it's all quite solid and well-executed. The maps are significantly varied in layout (though not so much in art style) and all leave room for different strategies and play styles. The game really starts to open up as you unlock more abilities as you progress through the campaign.  I would highly recommend this game if you enjoy singleplayer, action games, and/or tower defense games. There are some pretty crazy sales for it, but honestly I would still feel like I've gotten my money's worth at full price.  The DLC is definitely worth buying if it's on sale, but maybe hold off if it's full price and you haven't fallen in love with the game yet.
3868	1	a	its good for a strategy game 
3831	0	a	i don't even know how i lasted so long on here it kind of sucks big balls
2926	1	a	great game.
823	1	a	A combination of tower defense and 3rd person action/shooting. This light hearted title asks you to not only strategize your defensive layouts but to also throw yourself into the thick of the combat in order to kill thousands upon thousands of bloodthirsty Orcs.
4474	1	a	I wanted this game for years, finally I own it and it has been worth the wait, it's easily the best in the franchise (In my opinon.)  This time you play as the power hungry european empires from the colonial era, like The British Empire (Salutes to Union flag) The French, Spainish, Russians and more, addtionally since this the Complete collection, you get the bonus DLC which includes some tribes and Asain powers like Japan.  A lot of features have been added like trading posts, and you can upgrade them from transported by horse into trains, however they removed some features I enjoyed like Captapults and cannons attacking areas you want them to, for an example if theres a forest in the way, I could send a small army of cannons to destory the forest so I can build a wall or something, sadly this feature has been removed possibly due to a glitch where you can attack ally buildings with no penalties.  Overall if your a fan of RTS games, there is no reason to say no to this amazing game.  *Note* Everytime I hear 'The New World' I keep thinking of these.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtgGjZk5sTc    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_9HwLlkpE   The one above is easily my favorite.  
781	1	a	I thought this was just a silly little same but for as simple as the idea is i find it really enjoyable.
5271	1	a	Fantastic time waster. Needs more content. Still, tons of fun especially if it's on sale.
1215	1	a	Fun little tower defense game was worth the $1.24 i paid for it so it gets a good review from me.
1336	1	a	George Washington died of old age during Act Two of Road to Independence.   10/10 for historical accuracy
3616	1	a	Best title from CA till thusfar...  Even RTW2 is not tipping this title from the Throne. Vanilla it is somewhat instable, especially with the Turkish faction. I think CA should have learned from the modding community. But improvements like DarthMod will take this game to the next level and brings it to a standard which CA should have delivered it.  Nevertheless the epic scale, time setting, technological advances which are at the base of the design in the first place. The level of detail in government, rule and triggering revolutions, changes the way on which the game game can be played, over and over again.   I would recommend all RTS gamers to just have a go on this complex but satisfying game. 
1802	1	a	Well, the only reason why I am still playing whole Total War games are battles. But these are in vanilla just terrible, so it is almost unplayable without some good mod(personally preferring DarthMod). Things about how bad campaigns in those games really are, are better to be unspoken. At least DarthMod campaign is bit better but of course it just can't smooth all mistakes made in vanilla. So I would not recommend this without mod but if you look at some of their newer games, you will understand that this game was their golden age. Thumb up!
1915	1	a	i love this game
2419	1	a	This game is amazing!!!
5254	1	a	Fantastic game. Eagerly awaiting the sequel. Seriously, buy this...very worth it!
4022	1	a	Best total war honestly its got everything you need to be content with it.
1205	1	a	I was at first not so happy about the system, but i found out that D3 reincarnation was more a mix of D3 and D2 and good stabil system, i just wish that you culd make you own groupe type, like elf ranger air - fire water, added a parth there can unlock a shoot from there give an other element dmg Â½ of main to bypass magic, so you can make you own unic soldier, an other thing there whuld be nice to is to get a parth there can make the creature from 2 size to 1 size there do less hp dmg but still got the bonus as normal. the lvl should be able to get higher but give minor extra like +1dmg +2 hp, x2 for dobble size.
3545	1	a	Wheather you perfer overpowering a nation to expand your own empire, to aid a nation under seige from an oppreser, or just sitting on the sidelines and waiting for the right time to send in your own forces to fight the unexpecting. This game delivers intense land battles as your line infantry exchange vollies, your artillery sit behind cover and lay waist to all those who pose a threat, and the cavalry lie in wait in the treeline waiting for the right moment to flank an unexpecting unit. Empire Total War is a great game I highly recommend this game.
4789	1	a	Damn this is fun! A simple space exploration with arcade style top-down space battles. It has successfully drawn me away from serious RPGs for many hours.
1575	1	a	The gameplay is fun, the visuals are GREAT (if you have a good computer), the sounds are realistic, and it is historically accurate. I would reccomend this. 9/10
2099	1	a	Empire total war adds a new meaning to strategy.if you are a major strategy fan or if you love the revalutionary war fan, then you should deffinetly buy it whenever you can.sorry for the poor spelling
1698	1	a	Empire Total War + DarthMod = best game
1475	1	a	this is such an awesome game 
4904	1	a	Definitely worth the price. Lots of fun.
4527	1	a	I have to admit, this game is extremly addicting to me, i am not 100% sure why.  Its a bit like the Torchlight of space games, you collect and fight and go just on for the next level - again and again.  It gets a bit repetitive after you have explored a good part of the galaxy and you have seen most of the missions, but still its fun for me, after more than 20 hours. Well worth the price from a play time / price perspective. And I havent even seen any zombies yet... so theres more of the story still for me =)  There is a Storyline to follow and side missions, some funny ones too. You have alot of technologies and shiptypes to discover, different tactics you can try out, and the graphics are pretty and colourfull.  I also played the beta before it was on steam, it allready has improved alot since that version and the Developers want to deliver even more content.  You can register this game on steam wherever you have bought it, thats also great.  If you dont have it allready - get it!
38	1	a	How does a TD (tower defense) sound combined with a third person shooter? combine it with crazy enemies and you've got Orcs Must Die! This game and its second version have small differences like the enchanters(or whatever they called themselves) OMD2 is more polished and has multiplayer but isn't as good for 1 person so get this if you have no real friends(like me)   If you're interested look up some gameplay videos on youtube :D
1594	1	a	*Played Road to Independence, and fought off the British *While killing the British the United Provinces declare war on France and Me *5 turns later United Provinces take France *2 turns later Spain declares war on United Provinces and takes over France *3 turns later My army is fighting the United Provinces in Europe *5 turns later I wiped them out *10 turns later Sweden is at war with Russia and destroying them *5 turns later I become somewhat like the UN and march on Sweden *2 turns later Sweden declares war on Denmark and takes their capitol *10 turns later I take Denmark's capitol back and gives it back to Denmark *2 turns later Denmark declares war on me because I am allied with Spain and the Cherokee are allied with Denmark and Spain attacks the Cherokee *5 turns later Denmark sends an army to America and takes over Boston  10/10 Would be attacked by Denmark again
5093	1	a	Just showing my support for 2 indie developers who put together a fun casual game. I haven't played it ong but see the potential for long-term play, or when in the diet coke and pretzel mood. That it's a space-themed game that doesn't take itself too seriously is a plus.
5032	1	a	This game is a lot of fun. Can't wait for the sequel. Very addictive.
2556	1	a	Ive been a fan of Total War since Medieval 1 was released. Empire and med 2 are still the games i return to again and again, i play Shogun 2 and Rome 2 but i think the game play and feeling of Empire should be looked at if the Total war gang ever think about a Medieval 3 (please dont mess it up) Shogun2/Rome2 i can take or leave but my life would have had big void without Medieval and Empire. im off now to put them Damn Yankies back in their place
4300	1	a	This game by far had the largest potential out of any other Total War game. Its all out trade system, diplomacy system, political system, and lead way into ship battles becoming a thing in the Total War Franchise were spot on. The only thing however that leads me away from giving this game a 10/10 is the many bugs, and lack of attention CA gave it.  Many bugs such as not being able to garrison two groups of a 140 units in a building that is able to hold 1000, led to major dissapointments for the battles, and overwhelming despair of it never being fixed. Instead only one unit group could ever be stored in each building, by all means however the combat was still amazing. As for the Grand campaign, it was dissapointing not to see lands in China, Indonesia, Brazil, or Africa (besides north africa) for conquest/colonization. This after all was suppose to be the Age of Imperialism, and Age of Colonization, not just North America limted colonization.  I wait for the time where there will be a mod that not only increases the lands to be explored, conquested, and colonized; but also to make the major combat enhancments (cannons, firerate, melee, flashes, range, and etc), and bug fixes on par to its sequal expansion Napoleon Total War.   Overall I give Empire Total War a 8.6/10  (If Napoleon Total Wars combat, and bug fixes merged with an expanded map version of Empire Total War, this game would be 50/10)  This is a title that needs to be overhauled, or re-made by CA.
1526	1	a	Honestly, that is one of the very few TW games i have ever played many hours and not even fought battles in RTS mode.  8/10  You can eazily win any Battle, with just Autoresolve and not even trying... Talking about the Campaign in normal mode. Since i am not that hardcore to waste hours upon hours of non-stop playing this kind of games. :) or am i?  Still very nice game. Enjoyed it a lot. Check out Youtube videos to see more real gameplay ;)
1131	1	a	dumbass war mage+orcs+traps+magick crossbow+magick sword+more rediculous traps=â¥â¥â¥â¥tons of dead orcs  but seriously this game is awesome, its a hero defense game, stop orcs getting from a to b using traps soldiers or slaughter them yourself, i had lots of fun playing it
2366	1	a	This game is my god mode.
4377	1	a	Very fun game. One of the best strategy games out there. Naval and land wars which make it cooler.
297	1	a	Great game. Bought on steam sale so it was certainly a bargain. The keyboard can be rebound using a custom cfg - search online for directions.
4106	1	a	Five Stars!
3218	1	a	Empire: Total War was an extremely enjoyable game to play. Single player was impressive, featuring both land and sea battles. The turn-based campaign system continued the evolution of the proven Total War style and the addition of multiple regions - I.E. North America and India - greatly expanded the game's realm of regions and nations. Despite the limited number of maps, the multiplayer was always entertaining in one way or another against other players of varying skills. Entertaining, that is, as long as your opponent did not resort to that annoying light infantry 'meat shield' nonsense.  Empire: Total War, however, suffered from several major drawbacks that were addressed and amended in Napoleon: Total War but were never retroactively applied to Empire. In 2010, Empire was essentially abandoned by the developers at Creative Assembly who seemed to put their undivided attention onto the release and expansion of Napoleon: Total War. The rush to leave behind fellows such as the Duke of Marlborough, Frederick II and William Howe in favor of Wellington and Bonaparte seemed very obvious (such as there only being four historical battles to play in ETW). This should not be too much of a surprise, however, since CA is a UK based company and the Brits have this unexplainable fixation with the Napoleonic era opposed to any of the other major conflicts of the Georgian time period. That said, Empire: Total War did showcase many signs that there was at least some contribution from real historical advisors behind the scenes. There were accurate descriptions and background information for each unit that could be recruited and there were countless facts, achievements and progress milestones of the 18th century as a whole featured in the turn based campaign mode. On the other hand, CA seemed to have left their software artists and developers to create visual material based on their own erroneous assumptions on things such as troop uniforms and accoutrements. The naval gameplay was praised as being a first for the Total War games, but it basically was mirrored directly off of the naval gameplay in Edios's awful 'Imperial Glory' that was released back in 2004. Empire's version was graphically superior with a Total War touch, but the naval gameplay system was pretty much identical to that in 'Imperial Glory', right down to the broadside control panel. Naval power was far too balanced among nations, so it was extremely frustrating to encounter pirate fleets with horrendously overpowered galleons and nations such as the Maratha Confederacy with multi-deck ships of the line. The naval engagements were still fun, a sight to behold when many ships were engaged in battle and were always the most challenging aspect of the game. However, I purchased Empire: Total War the month it was released in 2009 for the land battles. Eighteenth century armies were expensive to raise, train, supply and equip. Campaigns were therefore usually more like a game of chess rather than a war of total destruction; the object was to maneuver here, besiege a city or a fort there and drive your opponent from the field when the battle was joined. Total War's gameplay, however, dictated pure body counts and defeating your enemy in detail. Smoothbore musket accuracy was therefore exaggerated, even though the muskets of the day could not accurately hit anything beyond 50 yards. Unfortunately, the AI controlled units in ETW were all pretty much created upon the old software framework dating back as far back as Medieval: Total War. The AI therefore had a preponderance at times for all-out melee fights and had a knack for always deploying in deep formations even though only the first 3 ranks could fire.  That said, the game's 'three rank fire' system was clunky (an entire formation of line infantry would wait for one guy to reload) and seemed to have been copied from a scene from the film 'Zulu' and not from any military history research. Historically, all three ranks in tight formation in the 18th century would usually fire a single volley together, either as one entire regiment/battalion/brigade, or by alternating sections along the line on the platoon/company/regiment level depending on the size of the formation. Another 3-rank method was where the front rank only would fire and then retire to the rear so the next rank could then step up and fire after they passed. Curiously, this had been accurately portrayed way back in Shogun: Total War with the arquebus units, but was not available in Empire. Having to spend several turns researching things such as rank fire and the 'fire and advance' maneuver when they were already standard in Europe by 1700 was very annoying.  Many of the finer details, such as uniform designs, were obviously created by the studio artists who had a limited knowledge of the time period. Units lacked uniformity in their musket designs and in their 'uniforms', which, no matter what year you were in during the game, all looked like costume interpretations of was worn in the 1760's. While muskets units had a limited range, they seemed as effective at 5 yards as they were at 100. There was no design variation from regiment to regiment, soldiersâ heights, etc. Artillery units all had the same range capability (shrapnel shot was not widely available until well into the 19th century) and massive 24 pounder siege weapons were turned into standard issue guns at a time when 3-pounder and 6-pounder pieces were dominant. Fixed siege mortars were given the power and range of WW1 artillery batteries. Grenadiers had beards at a time when facial hair, especially in 18th century western European armies, was prohibited. Native American tribes were able to field armies of thousands upon thousands of warriors. Drummers on the march beat their drums like a hummingbird flapping it's wings, when in fact they were there to set a much slower beat for troops to march to. Rifle units, with their deadly accuracy, loaded as fast as musket units, had swords (even the American riflemen wearing hunting frocks) and unreasonable hand to hand fighting skills v. other infantry. While many of these issues were thankfully fixed in Napoleon: Total War, it pretty much put a damper on the gameplay in Empire. CA eventually corrected many of Empire's early glitches and bugs and expanded the game with DL content, such as the War of Independence units, which, despite the blatant uniform flaws (like the Royal Welch Fusiliers uniform, which was totally wrong), was a great addition to the multiplayer. In the end, was Empire a good game? Most definitely yes. Once you got past the little quirks, many of which would only be noticed by those knowledgeable in the period, there were plenty of times ETW was extremely impressive with its scope and downright beautiful graphics. Empire turned out to be not just mindless strategy and conquest - this game expanded the historical knowledge of anyone who played it. For example, how many who played ETW knew beforehand that the British used light infantry tactics extensively in the American War of Independence? I look forward to when CA returns to this time period in the years ahead to make ETW 2. I just hope CA would contact more historians and historical reenactment groups in the future, since these individuals and groups would gladly help out CA to make sure the period was accurately portrayed!
2161	1	a	For some reason the Spanish version was downloaded....disappointed.
3853	1	a	the bigger the army and navy,the land i get
450	1	a	Definitely one of the coolest tower defense-like games. It didn't take long before the levels started getting a little more difficult (in terms of trying to achieve all 5 skulls per level). There's also a Nightmare mode that is even more difficult.
5103	1	a	Highly recommend this game for those who are armchair space fleet commanders. Its a small footprint, big impact game that keeps feeding you awesome in its own way.
993	1	a	I bought this for the Steam Holiday Sale to do the achievement, and found that it was very fun to play. If you're looking for something a little less intenstive than Dungeon Defenders, this is your game.
650	1	a	Damn, this is some great tower defence meets FPS meets rivers of orc blood.
574	1	a	Not only is it one of the best tower defense games ever, but you get to join in the action first-person. And there are so many ways to do it, the maps have a great deal of replay value. I've logged on 100+ hours already, and I'm not done yet.
493	1	a	-Addicting Gameplay  -Nice Creature -I Like Cartoonize graphics Video games -Its Extended Verison of PvZ garden warfare maybe ;)
51	1	a	Super awesome game where you do tower defense while attacking stuff. You get to kill hoards of orcs!
4144	1	a	Very good game and a wonderful campaign for the USA. It gets a big boring lategame when you are eternally powerful, but it is worth the price. (As of now 4.99, but I say up to 15 dollars.)  Multiplayer servers still active.
420	1	a	Good combination of tower defence, strategy and action. The levels are great and doesn't get me bored. I also recommend playing Orcs must die 2!.
2790	1	a	E:TW is decent but needs improving. This improveing comes from Darthmod. Darthmod fixes the AI bugs a grapical issuses while leaveing the true game intact. So Vanilla or Darthmod, great game.
2689	1	a	Life, liberty, and the pursuit of colonies. -Prussian States of America
592	1	a	Tower defense meets 3rd person shooters. Most excellent, highly recommend it.
417	1	a	very fun and very addicting if you love tower defense games and first person advencture/action games this is the game for you as it takes both those genres and blends it into awesome
1442	1	a	202 hours, need I say more? Ok I will! Absolutely one of, if not the best title in the Total War line. With the absolutely breath taking grasp of the campaign map or the massive battles, both land and sea, or a combo of both, this game has a great ability to draw you in and before you know it....... Its almost 7 years later , you now sport a mid chest length beard, got married and had a child. I find myself adding at least 10 hours a week to my already vast amount of TIME WELL WASTED on this title.  100/10 Creative Assembly, well played... GG. My babysiter also says thank you, you payed her school tuition, would neglect offspring again!
2374	1	a	This game is kinda meh... if you like commanding armies it's okay. Id rather spend money on Earth Empire or something along those lines... but if you like the EMPIRE series and 1600's then this is your game. Multiplayer lacks greatly imo...
165	1	a	Nice game, I want to try Orcs Must Die 2 :D
3466	1	a	great game worth the money
3524	1	a	From Europe, To The American Continent, From Europe to Asia. The Armies will march and the world will tremble by the sound of our cannons !
546	1	a	What I learned from this game: Orcs can get pierced, slashed, crushed, burnt, frosted, exploded, desintegrated ... and the really nice cartoony graphics make this look even funny. Recommended!
766	1	a	One of my favourites in 2011
3044	1	a	it is not the best ther is but it is a good game
4821	1	a	One of the best 2D topdown space shooters, with A LOT of upgrades, many ships, a lot of exploring. If you are obsessive about stuff you might find your self wasting a lot of time on this, but it's a lot of fun so go for it.
2904	0	a	I have sunk a lot of time into this game because I believed it was good - but just like a starving African child who glorifies a piece of moldy bread - I had no idea what I was missing.   Buy Napoleon: Total War instead, it is a much more polished version of this game. Admittedly, Empire is better if you are all about building oversea mega-nations that are constantly harried by sword-wielding savages.
4932	1	a	Crazy addictive. Once of the best indie games I've played.
3015	1	a	I enjoyed the game quite a bit. If you wanted to lead the United States through the Revolutionary war you can or just become the first world leader, your choice. 8/10
2606	1	a	It is a fantastic game with a lot of factions and more continents like America
2252	0	a	I love this game don't get me wrong but it has flaws and pros the AI is damn near impossible to make agreements with (they wanted my land) like if your a huge nation then they will make relations easier but if you arent then prepare for hell  8/10
1999	1	a	Had to fight ten French line infantry units with one brittish Militia unit, the french surrendered. 10/10
3135	1	a	One of the best total wars titles out there, great gameplay, first introduction to naval warfare, 3 theatres of operations but you need mods to have any real challenge as the AI is very defensive and rarely attacks, also the maratha confederacy always becomes an overwhelming power unless you keep it in check from the start or limit theirs expantion by conquering the mugals!
5120	1	a	It may seem like an innocuous game at first but believe me it is highly addictive. I have already spent hours and hours playing it. Would highly recommend it.
3537	1	a	Like this RTS, only it is slow.
3495	1	a	Another great Total War Game involving the British conquest of the United States of American and how they fought back to withold the domination of the USA under British rule.
3145	1	a	Colonialism is so much fun.
5282	1	a	Had a blast! Can't wait for the sequel to go on sale! :)
3954	1	a	I played the game not on my steam version. I have over 1000 hours on non steam version.  This game is pretty good, but it has bugs creative never fixed. The naval combat is amazing and computers nowadays can finally run it properly.   This is probably the best Total War game made, except maybe Shogun 2.
4722	1	a	Pretty fun game. 8.5 out of 10
4290	1	a	Top quality game!
3976	1	a	great game!!!!!!!!!!
1099	1	a	
1108	1	a	Tower defence in a nutshell. You protect a portal from invading orcs that come via air or ground. You have several traps at defending this portal at your disposal. As you progress in the game you can upgrade these traps and gain access to more. As the hero, you are capable of assisting the traps with a crossbow, a sword, or magic which can also be upgraded as you progress.
2102	1	a	This is a fun game if you're looking for a Historical Stratagy game, one downside may be long wait times after you are done with your turn but it's not that bad.
4834	1	a	I really enjoy this game.
5007	1	a	I have been a fan of the Escape Velocity series on the old Macintosh computers, back when I was stuck on a Mac with barely any games. Escape Velocity by Ambrosia Software was one of the few games that were actually GOOD on the Mac, and I enjoyed the series a lot.   SPAZ is very similar in terms of controls, and the 2D space combat action, but more combat-centric than that of the Escape Velocity series. Auto-building your destroyed ships, simple ship outfit customizability, infinite missiles (if equipped with missile launchers), etc. are some aspects that cuts out the micro-management, and more PEW PEW, BOOM!  Even if you aren't familiar with Escape Velocity, it is a fun game that is fairly easy to get into. With randomly generated galaxies upon save creation, and difficulty settings, it provides some pretty good replay value as well, being able to test out different strategies along the way. If you enjoy space combat action, SPAZ is a great game for some big explosions.
2383	1	a	Probly thee best total war game I have ever played in my life hours of fun trust me !!!
4424	1	a	This Game is Awsome I love it and have 42 hours of playtime!
3258	1	a	this is a good game i play it on a crapy cheap laptop and on low i get 20fps this isnt great but its good for me. Huge campaign map and cool factions this is a very expansive game i would recommend it
5160	1	a	Really fun game, although it does not look appealing at first, it is a really good game, if you are into these kind of games that is.
4080	1	a	i think that you should make a dlc wich adds new forts in the single player mode for =siege battels
2840	1	a	Yes, now I can get a good grade on my history test.
1422	1	a	Absolutely fantastic game. The only downside is it draws me away fro the homework im meant to be doing. The combat is excellent as are the graphics
2447	1	a	One of the best in the series, at least of all the modern Total Wars. Check out mods for this one  (www.twcenter.net) 
3008	1	a	one of the best strategy games I ever played.
1101	1	a	This game is surprisingly clever, and a fantastic tower defense game.
984	1	a	This game is so much fun!!! I highly recommend for some Orc pwnage!
1612	1	a	I really spent so much hours in playing Empire: Total War because of it's much more realistic economy system than any other Total War Game (and I love realistic economy systems). Not only through colonization you have many options for trade with expensive goods (like coffee, tea, sugar) with other colonist nations, you also can try to push up or down the price on the world market to enhance your situation. You also have minor cities with different prosperity levels besides your provincial capitals where you can focus on factories or (if it is a poor city) on curches to improve religious integrity or even brothels for a satisfied population. You may also build Universities to research technologies faster to get a positive distance to your neighbour states. All in all, Empire: Total War is a really good game and today you get it mostly for 10â¬ or below. I can recommend it to everybody who likes games that combine real time battles with turn-based management on a campaign map!
2901	1	a	Another great game from the same team that brought Rome and Medieval II, the is vast and keeps the player invovled in the building of an empire
1074	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥
3111	1	a	easily the best total war game i have played! i really hope they make another one like this!
2073	1	a	Very addicting and fun!
3014	1	a	amazing game, i recommend it to anyone looking for a good gaming experience. very good war game.
826	1	a	Hell O' Game!! Definate replay value here. Reminds me of what Plants Vs Zombies would look like in 3D.
1604	1	a	10/10 Would send elephants on militia again.
4679	1	a	This game is loads of fun and its challenging too. Tons of different ships to pilot and tons of upgrades to add to them also the writing is amazing props to devs for making such a funny game and very enjoyable.
60	1	a	Not sure if this is a third-person tower defense game or a shooter game on steroids. Either way, ORCS  MUST  DIE!
3749	1	a	Just another aweomse total war...really wish they'd do a ww1/ww2
2378	0	a	Great game!
507	1	a	Very cool and good planned TD action/game
1994	0	a	Empire: Total War takes some great steps forward but you can definitely tell that the developers were stepping outside their comfort zone with this game. City sieges for some reason have been relegated to attacking/defending a fort for some reason which is crazy since Medieval 2 (released 3 years prior) had a multitude of different maps which included full sprawling cities, forts, and encampments.  Iâve also noticed that actually just using your infantry in melee is generally more effective than just trading musket fire (especially if they have any experience).  Really, if I didnât know any better Iâd say this was a mediocre mod for an older TW game.
3513	1	a	The Best Strategy Game ever!!! (except Civilization IV)
1560	1	a	This game is very fun to play if your one who likes to control armys and many other things. The online is also really fun with the sea battles land and siege battles you can team up with up to 3 of your friends to play together and use team work to win or be a lone wolf! i definitly would recommend this.
2696	1	a	It's pretty good as strategy games go. There are all kinds of formations you can put all your different squadrons in. Plus global domination.
4610	1	a	You are in space.  You do pirate-y things.  There are zombies involved.  Bounty hunters are jerks.  This game is fun.  Can't wait for SPAZ2. 
4257	1	a	Fun and addictive, Like most of the early Total war franchise.
2326	1	a	One of the finest strategy games out there. I love the combat, I love the world map (except the political instability mechanic, which isn't fleshed out enough and seems to exist only to be exploited).  I just wish the game was less buggy and didn't crash every time I tried to play it.
2271	0	a	NO NOT BUY THIS GAME FOR CO-OP / MULTIPLAYER CAMPAIGN!!!!!  I bought two copies of this game for the sole purpose of playing co-op campaign with my girlfriend. After we downloaded the whole thing, we learned that Creative Assembly has taken the co-op mode and locked it as some sort of 'beta test'. The only way to get access to this 'beta test' is to Email Sega and beg for one.  So I did. Sega e-mailed me back a week later and told me 'tough luck, we're not giving you an unlock code for the co-op mode'. So basically this game HAS a functional co-op mode, it's just locked up in some steam repository somewhere.  Honestly, I feel pretty ripped off right now. Hopefully this will help someone else avoid the same pitfall.
2457	1	a	It's just the most impressive game about the 18th century
5220	1	a	Great game. Love the story, love the mechanics, love the combat and gameplay.
3720	1	a	While this is a alpha-version of Napoleon Total War, I would certainly reccommend getting this if it is on sale. The replay ability! Woah.
4364	1	a	Awesome game! I never get tired of playing it.
3623	1	a	great gane realy fun buy this game its the best great ship battles and ground and good campain
2968	1	a	One of the best, if not, the best Total War game...
3278	1	a	just a really good game
850	1	a	Verry nice, and fun game, the best game to come down if you are mad :D
1054	1	a	really addicting tower defense game and can really get u thinking
2016	1	a	Ive spent so much time playing this game its soooo â¥â¥â¥â¥ing good
742	1	a	The best rgp 3ird person Tower defance I hav eevery played well the only one I have played but still worth it the sequal is comming out soon also worth it the only bad thing is you will get tired half why through need commitment
1111	1	a	so whats the point of this game you ask? duh. kill everything the combat? you just shoot and slice EVERYTHING you see thats soon-to-not-be-alive! the traps. omg the traps are sssssssssoooooooooo AWESOME at killing stuff!   ...but...   the story (sigh) the story in ssssssssssssooooooooo awful but this is still a great game so 9/10
2848	0	a	Bugs... bugs everywhere,   the texts on the game is very problematic for me, They are very very hard to read. I searched the internets but no clear solution. Deal with it?  No way!
2361	1	a	The last great Total War game. Too much was made of its teething problems; long ago resolved, this nails why it was fun being a European coloniser, and much less fun to be colonised.
2487	0	a	SEGA pushed CA to release it too soon. This is the result. Don't buy it. Don't even take it as a gift.
3574	1	a	As some total war fans aren't sold on this game, I have spent countless hours playing. The campaign map is MASSIVE and economy/technology research really plays big on the success of your campaign. Although micro-managing all your regions can be tedious at times it keeps you on your toes (as with all total war games). Battles are fun and graphics are getting a little outdated for todays standards but solid none the less. Highly recommend this game if you like managing an empire and making cunning strategic and diplomatic decisions to turn the campaign in your favor and outwit and out muscle your oppenents. 9/10
3677	1	a	great game spent hours playing this
2962	0	a	Not as good as Med 2 or Rome..  I wouldnt bother with it as there are so many TW games that are better than it
1642	1	a	Cool Game!
3158	1	a	Fun if you like history, destroying history, or just destroying.
2185	0	a	The text size is too small I downloaded a bigger text but don't know how to mod it into the game.
3061	1	a	Very Realistic, but Darth Mod is a Mod that makes the game Look better in UI and just everything Basicly
379	1	a	Good game. Worth the 5$ I spent at the time. It'll get frustrating, though. Buy it for the lolz.
77	1	a	This is one hell of a fun reverse-tower-defense game, mixed in with a FPS. Great stuff. If you like battling orcs, then you'll love Orcs Must Die!
3738	1	a	This is the best in the series. Created an Indian Empire in Britain and America and also took over India and South America as Poland. 10/10  Pros: - Campaign is brialliant, expansive and can be done numerous times without getting dull - Troops are fairly varied, especially with the DLC which is farily cheap - Graphics are great - I personally enjoy having the industry spread over the region and not controlled in the main town - Huge step up in building and recruitment ease from previous editions - All other pros you associate with a Total War  Cons - Potentially the industry being spread makes it hard to manage - some nations have more troop types than others but minor issue
4856	1	a	Worth it
363	1	a	If you like tower defeance games its for you protect you portal from the ugly cretures!
1812	1	a	This game was my first Total War experience, and I must say, I was quite lost at the start of my journey. The grand strategy and RTS genres were probably the ones I had the least experience with, but playing around with this for 340+ hours was both an enlightening and rewarding experience. Even though this game is old and outdated by todays standards, that doesn't mean it isn't worth trying. I have completed around five grand campaigns, and as expected, are very similar to one another. The three 'superpowers' of the time period (Britain, France and Spain) are the only factions that have missions, one for each of them. The game does little to encourage more playtime apart from these three faction specfic missions and the initial goals of conquering a set amount of regions, making the mid-game quite tedious. One thing that needs to be addressed (and probably never will be by CA) is the fact that the Maratha Confederacy is ridiculously unbalenced. I've seen them field between 10-15 armies (a few of them full stacks) just in one region. I'm not sure if they're supposed to act as an invasionary force much like the Chaos Warriors in the newly released Total War: Warhammer, but if they are, it hasn't been done right. I've noticed that the aggressiveness of the Confederacy may be due to a patch made by CA due to complaints about factions not being offensive enough and is frequently mentioned in old posts found on the Total War Forums for this game.  Apart from this, the battles are entertaining and sometimes (perhaps rarely) even challenging, depending on the troops you field (to this day, I still haven't mastered Cavalry units). The siege variant of these battle can be boring, unless you take the fight straight to the enemy, unlike the historical methods of these situations. Sea battles are initially confusing, but are actually quite simple and easy to master. I recall that there is a guide someone wrote regarding this.   Overall, the game stands as a great acheivement and a welcome first step into the world of the RTS and grand strategy. It may trip over its own feet at times, but the entertainment value found in the game is ultimately up to the player.  Edit: Also, the Warpath Campaign is hard for the Iroquois, and the Austrian Army barely stands a chance against the Prussians from the get go. Very-Hard difficulty is insane, and combat bonuses for the enemy are ridiculous. Keep it to normal or if you want a challenge, hard for decent enjoyment.
5047	1	a	This is very nice This is a complementary review.  The difficulty settings are thouroughly thought. Any complaint about difficulty, rebuilding, etc.  Is the player's fault. The difficulty settings, and map/campaign customs at the begining are directly related to adapt the game to you. if your a massive noob, choose the according settings!  This is a complementary review.
536	1	a	BOOM GOES THE DYNAMITE!
1558	1	a	Empire is a classic, at its current state, a great game. Though not perfect, it captures the 1700's century brilliantly with musket warfare and the wave of Colonization. Fun for history gamers and RTS fans
4837	1	a	Try out this inde space shooter game.
1136	1	a	Really enjoyed this game, even more than it's sequel.
373	1	a	Everyone should check this out. Really great gameplay, really addicting and a lot of fun.
4825	1	a	A fun game to grind and blow stuff up.
5017	1	a	The dev said they didnt see any games of the kind and did it thenselves and did it GOOD , its not repetitive as some may describe (like a shooting game you have to shoot and that doesnt make it repetitive) has a very good storyline and playability is awesome , you have to kill a ship to use it or at late game it come by killing some other high level zombie. you get what u fight for and survive to harvest and atack!!!
4805	1	a	Awesome fun for the price. Looks simple but is has a ton of depth, research trees, custom ship outfitting and upgrading, mining, space pirating. Soon you'll have a small fleet of ships under your command and a huge galaxy to explore, do what you like or follow the story. Loving it!
458	1	a	The fact that, with all the games I could be playing at this point, I've been going back to this one repeatedly to finish a new level, says a decent amount about it alone. I love classic Tower Defense style games, which this most resembles, and it does those parts well. Even if it was just setting the traps and watching the Orcs gib, that would probably be enough, but the FPS aspects (with which you can win without setting a trap at all on some levels) and are also well done and fun to use or (as I tend to do) supplement your traps by stunning orcs in range.
4340	1	a	It helps me vent my imperialistic urges
2262	0	a	to be honest- one of the worst rts games I have ever played. Sound consists of random grunts to unfitting music, textures only sometimes load in, and the gameplay is boring and repetitive. 3/10 at the most.
961	1	a	this game it the â¥â¥â¥â¥ its a must buy
1678	1	a	Awesome game, I defiently reccomend you buy it :D
496	1	a	This game is a fun tower defense game, because not only you build things to defend but you can control and customize your character on how you defend the stage, the stages are challenging and different in variety. I like the cartoonish graphics and the very comedic vibe that it has. For over all verdict I'd say that this game is fun and challenging, and I would like to recommend it to everyone.
1303	1	a	&gt;Becomes the Germans (Prussia) &gt;Invades Poland &gt;Austria declares war &gt;mfw I own Austria &gt;Every single main Europeon nation declares war &gt;mfw I own Europe  10/10 would invade Poland again
337	1	a	Its a Nice TD With a twist. ITS SO FUNNY XD and mass killing is fun fun fun 
3462	1	a	This game is the best thing I found to replace Command and Conquer games now that they are not compatible with the newer OS setups, fun to play, easy to learn, but still a decent challenge.
2154	1	a	I like this game (hence the hours I have played) but I have to be honest it's an enjoyable but ultimately a flawed game.   There are better Total War games in the franchise.   This game has so much unfufilled potential.   What really holds this game back is it is unfinished.  This games works better for me when it is modded.   I recomend you look at this review   Why Empire total war failed a review by Reynold Sanity  
1968	1	a	This is Gods gift to history buffs and geeks!
294	1	a	Very fun with cheat engine. Im not a cheater. Cheat engine doesn't count
2822	1	a	Fantastic game 10/10
547	1	a	ORCS MUST DIE! Kil them how u want!
3120	1	a	Its a game that has incredible depth, you'll be playing Empire Total War for months
3768	1	a	Play As Britain Become A Superpower Country and more Glorius Than British Empire   And Ruled almost all land in India   
841	1	a	Fun as hell and addictive. The voiceovers are great too with the right amount of humor.
4413	1	a	This game definatly shows its age but is still in my opinion the best Total War game to date. It is nearly impossible to get bored from this game as well since the map is huge and diverse; and with amazing mods like Darthmod the battles look and feel realistic and epic. A must play for fans of history and/or strategy games alike
2949	1	a	One of my fav games. Addicting. V-E-R-Y addicting. If you people love strategy games where u get to conquer the world this is for ya. Just like every other total war game this one doesn't dissapoint aswell : )
247	1	a	Battle waves after wave of Orcs in this funny fun filled highly addictive content packed Cartoony Action / Tower Defense / Strategy hybrid Indie game.
511	1	a	Just bought this game on sale for $3.74, and it was worth it. I've only played 10 minutes to get a christmas achievement, and I want to play more. Headshots are so easy, and killing orcs is pretty fun!
2674	1	a	Overall, great game, i strongly recemend this game if you love real time stratigy
3568	1	a	Its the best Total war of the series for me thus far. I quite enjoy the mechanics of the game and the challenges it brings. While the naval combat does still leave something to be desired, its ground campaign is very strong as always. The visuals are stunning and its global campaign maps added a new fun level of challenges.
3591	1	a	One of my all time favorite games, Empire: Total War places you in the early 1700's and invites you to take up the cuase of one of the worlds major powers during that period. Although the AI was unfinished by the developers - particularly the campaign AI - gameplay is still enjoyable and, when on hard, so what challenging. Naval battles are introduced into the Total War franchise for the first time in this game, and all the titles since then have tried to live up to the standard set by Empire. None have even come close yet. If you have played any of the other Total War games then Empire will offer you new challenges as you attempt to manage the sheer size of the campaign map. For new players, welcome to the very best of the franchise so far. Rome 2 isn't a bad effort from CA (the developers), but let's just hope that it is a warm up for Empire 2! Highly reccomend Empire: Total War - 9/10
4180	0	a	It was really good game, but to be Honest, Darthmod shall be added to this game. I don't/cant install, Because to be honest, i'm not really good at install/I was too lazy to install. Line Infantry need to wear same uniform as maryland.
1949	1	a	Lets begin by saying that Napoleon: Total War is better if you are not willing to mod this game. N:TW is basically what Empire was supposed to be. Cost an extra game's worth :(   See, E:TW was 'broken' into service. Originally so badly launched that you couldn't even play it until a week after release, it was patched over, and, over, this bug, that bug, and after a time, CA just said 'Damn, GG. Next game :('   So what's that make it now? The best Total War ever, ironically. Top three at least. Read on and see how this catastrophe turned into a miracle.  History: After a long time, post - N:TW release, the head dev of CA came out and said something along the lines of (paraphrasing) 'E:TW was just beyond the scope of what we were capable of' and just gave all the deepest dev tools over to the mod community. Damn, E:TW looked so good in previews! I honestly was rooting for them all the way - this was gonna be a showstopper. But, we got more than we bargained for.   See, guns were a massive step from medieval2 combat. Things were going to be different and people were stoked! But the AI wasn't quite there to match the era yet. For example,   -the AI for properly lining a unit and properly zerging with a axes are two separate war principles -the economy of traditional units versus guns. Sorry horses - start of point and shoot warfare -AI could not manage artillery based combat AT ALL. Oh yes, in RL they shelled people down until they did something, it's a legitimate tactic. Pretty sure firing into hills is not. -some new features like research. If 2 schools beat the AI, it wasn't ready for players to go like, 8  +Naval combat. First time ever! Ironically, this was the most polished AI and in major engagements it was okay. But when you realized it just chases it was so abusable. A 6th rate could sink the Spanish Armada solo by simply running alot and maintaining distance.  But... the scale of the world, man! Gone were the days of Europe, you now manage an Empire. Multi-map, continental combat. The Earth itself. Yet, that was too grand a step for CA. Some serious design flaws led to, once again, easily abusable tactics that needed patches. Ex. The AI 'originally' couldn't figure out how to land armies. If you were Britain you won the game, besides the OP start position you had in the world. No attempts to make a multimap game have occurred since Empire: Total War, from this time of writing. All evidence of an 'exterior world' lies on beacons or map icons representing the rest of wherever, and you send a unit to sit on it like some couch potato. In Empire, you sent a freaking army, on your navy, D-day style. Oh hell yes!  Luckily, like an Elder Scrolls mod community, E:TW's fans took the work into their hands and have many ways to polish this game into a true gem. Like rebuilding a classic car, not every '69 Fastback you can get comes in mint condition, and with the Karate Kid focus of many Empire fans, This Game is a Proper Addition to the Total War series.   Thumbs Up. So before you go autobuy N:TW, consider E:TW plus a megamod. Something like DarthMod Ultimate Commander to this. Get the same-ish game for less, but with a polished AI, bug fixes galore, and so much more potential for mischief.  Will the Inuit overwhelm the fledgling United States and invade France, causing a power struggle in Europe? Have you ever seen how big a Pirate armada can become if left unchecked? Will Britain win like always again because it has Jamaicans, or are Dutch coffee shops more powerful? All this and more inside :D
2364	1	a	What can I say, I love the Total War series. Its accurate, fun, sucks you in, and allows you to pause the game and pick up at a later time so that you can better organize your forces. Amazing franchise, amazing game. 10/10
4670	1	a	Awesome game, just awesome!
2327	1	a	Great game as always from tw but the battles can get old quickly as the diversity of troops is no longer there. cannon are extremly inaccurate and caverly and melee troops get crushed by line infantry. Most factions only have 3 or 4 types of line infantry. AI is also prone to suicide as they will attack a full stack with 6 units in an open field leaving their town ungaurded. Diplomacy is ridicoulous regardless of what your trying to accomplish.
3271	1	a	Awesome game! always love the total war games.
4405	1	a	Although sometimes buggy, it's still a great TW game. The fact that you can play in America, Europe, India, Noth Africa and the Middle East might seem overwhelming at first, but you'll soon be immersed into the action. My 2nd favourite TW game, after Rome 1. I'd give Empre a solid 1763/1776.
4041	1	a	a hightly stratigic higly tactical games not for the newbies
4186	1	a	Take command over 18th Century troops and get independence for America, overthrow Europe as Prussia or whatever you like. There are not many restrictictions in what you can achieve, only your actions will determine the outcome of the Game. Some of the Game Mechanics are rather weird, for example if you station two infantry units directly behind each other it may occur, that the second in line shoots their own troops in the back. Same with artillery stationed behind Infantry. But all in all a very enjoyable game!
1443	1	a	20 vs 20 battle is epic.
1285	1	a	The reviews come close to showing what this game is about, but it can't show you just how good it is because what you'll see will be different than what anyone else sees. The strategies that you will come up with will be different. It's because your arenas will be different, your power up options will be different, and your enemies will be different. This is a different kind of game.  There are only two things about this game that some people may not like. The graphics are blocky and there is no goal other than the level you reach.  If you love a challenge, and enjoy slick game design, you should play this.
4270	1	a	Only been playing for a few days but overall this game has out performed my expectations. Nuff said
2611	1	a	.
4171	1	a	Its a must get for fans of the total war serise and i will write about the pros and cons  Pros -you can conquer most of the globe -Its fun taking ove regians -become emperor of Europe -you can make th roman empire agian  Cons -it can get laggy at some points -the turns can go for ever -you only get 99 turns until the campagine is over  over all i would give it 8/10 thanks for reading
4514	1	a	Brings back fond memories of Star Control. Loved every bit of it!
2809	1	a	Good game. It was rather buggy, had terrible AI and diplomacy... But it was good. And I assure you it's much more better with Darth Mod. Give it a try.
1842	1	a	i love this game
4432	1	a	You look for perfect stratregy game?Well this game is for you.     ---------------------&gt;BEST STRATREGY GAME&lt;------------------------

1870	1	a	-playing as Poland-Lituania -Prussia invades my protectorate, Saxony -declare war, bring Austria into the frae -Prussias allies with the Ottomans, -Ottomans attack Austria -Great Britain declares war on the Ottomans -The French help the Ottomans -the Dutch fight the French -The Swedes invade Denmark -Russia invades Sweden -Spain attacks Russia -results in a devestating war all over a small country 10/10 would recomend
3483	1	a	Empire total war is my Number 1 game of all time, because it brings you into a time of human history were there was a lot of change and devolopement which shaped our modern world as we know it today. Its an amazing historical game were you can learn a lot from and also change the path of history like for example you can prevent the French Revolution or destroy major nations such as Spain or Russia. It's a game were you can experience an empire on such a gobal scale and feel like you're an emperor. It gives you an insite on 18th century warfare were the fighting was done face to face. I always enjoyed playing this game, i've never gotten bored of it, theres always something new or different to experience. I hope you will enjoy this game as much as i do, its a game worth buying even though its 3 years old.
2159	1	a	You can be the Swedish Empire and prevent the Russian Empire from happening Best game ever I rate it Carolus Rex/10
1047	1	a	This is my new personal favorite amongst all 3rd-person tower defense games!!! Great fun, but unfortunately only singleplayer.
5329	1	a	It's not a good 'game' for newbies. No, it's not...  I use to sit at a place and watch the sunset. I had no idea how to actually shoot, drive and complete missions.  It's like my personal sunset simulator. And it's damn beautiful.  10/10
1332	1	a	Great Strategy Game, PvP Battles, Campaign in single player and rule the world. Revolutions, Settlement Uprisings, Native American Campaigns. Very entertaining and like the early Call of Duty games it actually teaches some history.
3866	1	a	Defeat the market economy.  Make this game free.  Raise the communism  â¥â¥â¥â¥ the capitalism.  Communists unite.  â­
787	1	a	This is a great tower defense style game with 3rd person shooter elements. Its pitfall is that it has no multiplayer support, but this is an issue solved in the sequel. You can upgrade your traps or your character's weapons, depending on your play style. Each map is unique and interesting, sometimes with the inclusion of environmental hazards.
2094	1	a	'I never saw so many shocking bad hats in my life '
3658	1	a	This game is amazing, especially with the Darth mod. The ai is fixed, adds a lot of new units, playable states, more agressive combat and a smarter ai. I was searching for immense epic musket battles for a long time, when i stumbled on empire. Many people say it's far too bugged, and that it marks the fall of total war. It is a little buggy, and yes, the engine has changed, but it is still good (and so brutal).
0	1	a	  Orcs Must Die! is a fun and simple tower defense game:    - Casual and easy to learn: you can play for less than an hour and still have fun! - Lots of different orcs to kill: melee orcs, range orcs, flying orcs, etc. - Lots of different ways to kill orcs: weapons, powers, traps, and guardians
2794	1	a	its good    1,000,000,000,000,000,000/10
4978	1	a	Great game. So worth the asking price. I like that there are alot of options on how you can play. Only note to the DEVS is to hurry and make the second one.
2008	1	a	I made a porcupine out of pikemen while my friend charged at me with thousands of natives. His men got shish kabobed while I sat there with pride as my Porcupine takes down its final men. My friend cries as I triumph over his redskins dead corpses. This game is rated 10/10 by Master Bater.
5175	1	a	-Space -Pirates -Zombies Nuff said
4798	1	a	A nice blend of arcade and strategy with loads of stuff to discover. Also it reminds Spore with Galaxy Map and the goal to get-to-the-center.
2972	1	a	This game, personal best total war game ever i just olve the diplomacy factor and that you must allso know how to manage and maintain your empire once you are able to expand, if you are looking for the most detailed game of the total war series this one is it as you must not only master land and sea battles you must now worry about religion, technology, diplomacy, piracy, and somany other factors taht added up together make a great game
355	1	a	A rather fun and fast-paced 'trap defense' game. It can feel a bit repetitive over time, though.
2415	1	a	very nice game! once played it's hard to stop
4305	1	a	1. Jumped in and played some tutorials. 2. Failed tutorials. 3. Played a land battle. 4. Mutilated by Indians since I didn't know how to control units. 5. Played a sea battle. 6. Beat Austria by barely doing anything. 7. Battled a friend 8. ez winz  9/10 would play again
2228	1	a	make it cheaper very fun on dah guest pass
69	1	a	'You go first'
4869	1	a	Top down space shooter with RPG elements... and ZOMBIES!!!  Lots of fun, can be hard as hell sometimes
1366	1	a	This game has a special place in my heart, because it is the game that really got me into the Total War series. The main thing I like about this game, is the campain map. technically, this map doesn't have the most settlements in the entire series, but it has the biggest map in any of the games. You can conquer India, North America and the tip of South America, Carribeans, and Europe. This gives it a more important feel and that your actions effect more people. I also love the variation of units for each faction. The american army had better skrimishers than the English, but the English's line infantry were more regimented and didn't break as easly. I also love the audio for this game. I would find myself scrolling up to a single unit and just listening to how well in sounded when he shot his musket. This is also the first in the series to introduce naval battles that you can play which look beutiful, but can be confusing. The bad part is that the A.I in this game is some of the worst I have ever seen. Half the time, they don't even move, and the other half, they just charge at you with no strategy whatsoever. To sum it up, this game is set in my favorite time period, and besides the cluncy AI, this game does the time period justice.
714	1	a	A rather fun and whacky game where you defend and let no orc pass thru.. Use a dozen of different traps, weapons to slay and mutilate orcs hahah... Fun and very challenging! :D
2617	1	a	Amazing game that depicts teh revolutionary warfare time period. If you are a revolutionary enthusiast like m, you will love this game.
3752	1	a	Look at how many hours I've played. That pretty much says it all. Gameplay is great, ranging from very easy to insanely difficult depending on your difficulty setting. Graphics still are great even in 2015. I would highly recommend this game if you like Risk or want to conquer the world in a game. It's a shame they don't have plans to make an Empire 2 because this is by far the most fun game in my opinion. The other Total War games are region-based and in my opinion that doesn't hold water to conquering the world. At $20, this game is worth every penny and then some.
381	1	a	This game is fun! The combat is clunky, but very nice and meaty. The variety in enemies, traps and weaponry is also quite impressive. Also, it's a pretty good challenge. It is kinda repetitive, though, and the campaign will only really take you about 12-15 hours. For what you get, though, it's definitely worth the $10/Â£7.
3210	1	a	Brilliant game. Still one of my top 3 of the Total War series, if not number one.
464	1	a	AWESOME game but it's a little short finished it on 5 hour's ;D 
356	1	a	A very entertaining tower defense game with a lot of action and a little bit of humor.
1636	1	a	I have always been fascinated with the Revolutionary War. Infact it is my favorite thing. This is a great game for all strategy and Revolutionary War fans!
2148	1	a	great game
4597	1	a	A great little game. The combat is fun and the visuals are nice. It can get a little repetitive, but the game throws some gameplay changes in later in the game.
1628	1	a	Contender for my favorite game of all-time, as well as one of the best strategy games in recent memory.  I've been playing TW games since the first Shogun, so I can honestly say it's the most diverse, comprehensive &amp; immersive TW made.  The only thing I was hesitant about were the naval battles, but I soon found out that their steep learning curve was WELL worth it. Every battle could potentially be Hollwood-caliber fare.   If you think the idea of taking a nation and blazing a path of glory through the three main theaters of the world, (North America, Europe &amp; India), is appealing, go for it.  Instant buy.  NOTE: I suggest you get Darthmod Empire for an even better, more realistic experience. 
5277	1	a	Simple game, a lot of fun. Well worth $5 USD
1395	1	a	Empire Total War is a great choice if you have an itch for Age of Sail/Gunpowder Era game play. For those of you whom may never have played a Total War title this next part is for you.   Total War games are a mixture of 2 common Strategy Game mechanics. You have a campaign board and you have a RTS Battle Mode. For the camapign board think Sid Meyer's Civilization, you control the empires finances, build queues and unit movements in this mode. When you go to fight an enemy force you then go into a RTS mode where the armies involved fight on a map that represents your location on the campaign board. Example, if your forces engage the enemy in a forest then expect the battle mode map to be a forest. If you attack an enemy that is blocking bridge access to the other side on the campaign board you will have to fight accross that bridge in the battle mode map if you want to win. The opposite is true if you are defending.   You can choose to automate nearly everything in this game, wether it be taxes, building queues or even land and sea battles. This makes it somewhat easier to learn the ropes of the game as it can be a bit overwhelming at first but I would suggest going straight for the deep end and learn how to do it all yourself.  Graphically the game looks great with maxed settings.  Audio seems legit most of time but every now and again i notice that some sounds vanish only to return later just as quickly as they left.  Quick note on pacing in the game, if you are new or just havent played in a while it can seem slow to start and in some ways it truly is. Trust that patience is a virtue in the early game because when the shiiyat hits the fan it will test you.  All in all i think Empire Total War is a great game and can certainly offer you many hours of enjoyment. I recommend this to anyone who likes strategy games and wants a colonial era setting in which to strategize.  10/10 would handle the American Revolution properly again 10/10 would watch thousands and angry axe wielding natives vanish in a charge on my lines again
327	1	a	Even once you beat the game, it's loads of fun to play!
43	1	a	Overall a good game for slaughtering Orcs. Being a fan of the Orc race myself in video games, it was enjoyable to slaughter thousands of goofy Orcs as they rushed towards you in the many different levels this game's storyline had. Many different games these days have vast differences in graphical designs, yet this game struck a good balance between keeping it simple and looking good at the same time. The same goes for the different skins and models available throughout the game.  The cutscenes explaining the storyline are a bit short, and lacking information at times, but the idea of this game is pretty straightforward; you kill Orcs. Lots and lots of Orcs. You've got many different ways to do it, all ending up in the brutal slaughter of Orcs. There are many different contrapments and weapons to help you along the way. Considering the purpose of this game, I would say this is one of the best Indie games I've played in a while and I look forward to playing Orcs Must Die! 2 as well.
3328	1	a	one of the most addicting games i have ever played strongly suggest buying this game
1516	1	a	Empire Total War might not be one of Total war best game, but is one hell of a FUN and Addicting game which got me playing for nearly a year! The game sets in 18th century earth and have tonnes of guns(not machine gun or rapid fire weapons of today sadly:( )and a huge map streching from the americas in the wests, to fricking india to the east.It does suffer from AI failures and glitches,but heck, who gives a damn about that crap, its a total war game that combines historical realism and total war domination to make it a 200% experience of conquering and warring in the world.To any strategy game fans like me,you guys better prepare yourselve in the arts of war cos to be a awesome and badass conquer, be like julius caeser in his saying: VENI, VIDI, VICI!
2630	1	a	is ight
3943	1	a	Really spectacular game! For all you 17th century war lovers this is what I would recommened!! 
4872	1	a	Very nice and cool space action. Kinda easy if you go slowly and cautious, but worth it anyway.  And besides it has zombies!
4147	1	a	This game could be so much more better this it need a remake.
3950	1	a	People give this game a lot of stick but I don't think it's that bad a game. Yes it's not perfect, but it's still a really enjoyable game to play.
945	1	a	Hate Orcs? Then this game is for you! A mixture of third person hero control, and tower placement. Hectic and insane, funny and cartoony. Orcs will hate this game.
2781	1	a	It's a good game but there is a few flaws to the game.  The first flaw is how you have a huge army and the enemy or AI have 1 Brigade left, and they shoot one of your men and they run away.  The 2nd flaw is that the naval battles are 97% Rigged and seem to win 3% of my battles.   The game should include basic fifers so it makes things easier for people who don't know how to add mods.  Overall, it rates a 92/100
2853	0	a	This is... Just play Shogun 2,
3024	1	a	one of the best but some tech issues.
2427	1	a	Love this game theres still a few bugs but better than what ive heard about rome 2
4174	1	a	Despite all its kinks and some very frustrating diplomacy nonsense, (like puny nations declaring war on my massive empire and refusing trade with me, even though I could crush them) if you have the patience then this game is alright. I'd even say pretty good. Once it has been modded to enable all factions, it becomes similar to EU4 in some respects. I really liked playing the Mughal Empire, or as Persia and rebuilding the Achaemenid Empire, or the Ottomans, the Spanish, the British and even the Native Americans!  I never actually bothered with France, or even Russia for that matter, but I like armies with lots of firepower, elephants, or powerful ships, and this game delivered immensely. Enough history to keep you interested, and the battlefield was not quite an improvement from Medieval II Total War, but it was decent enough. I have nearly 400 hours on this game, and I must say, Absolute Monarchy is the best way to go in the long run. My administration was always top of the line, and it helped a lot to fire/hire whoever I wanted.  Yes this game does have some issues, and I have heard they were solved somewhat in Napoleon, although the different theaters of war took out the Americas (Wtf?) and India (Come on!), still this game has a legacy worth continuing and looking back on.  7.9/10
1864	0	a	Great gameplay, cool units, etc. The Total War Saga -including Empire- is absolutely awesome, on paper. BUT then you find out that between so much offering DLC's, Sega has done absolutely nothing about fixing the constant crashes in all their games. It happens in Empire, Napoleon, Shogun, Rome II (NOT gonna buy Warhammer, sorry). When some of the people in your team are incapable of some decent coding and you don't replace them after a couple of buggy games, the bottom line is that you only care about making a few quick bucks.
3934	1	a	Great game if you like to conquer the new world and have the natives take back their lands or be some white power race like the Brits or the U.S.A. lol
2223	1	a	Does anybody want to join the 3rd Kentucky on Mount and Blade: North and South? Just add Me, Hardcase726 and add Musickman101 on steam then message our Colonel and Youtube Celeb Musickman101, and tell him that you want to join and that Hardcase726 sent you. See you on the Battlefield! 
2277	0	a	The worst total war game. AI is terrible, diplomacy is terrible, the battles are terrible, miusic for battle is very unmotivating. I hope they eventually come out with a second Empire because I like the concept but the game was over all bad.
1830	1	a	So after playing almost 50 hrs or so, I can honestly say this game is awesome. worth at full price.
4748	1	a	There is a bit of a learning curve up front, but this game is a gem once you get going. Along the lines of Starscape (which I've previously recommended), you are gradually exploring the galaxy using small ships deployed from a larger mothership. As you go, you will develop relationships with local civilian or military factions, fighting missions for them to gain experience and advance your research. Upgrade all aspects of your mothership and deployable crafts, and iteratively gain the ability to explore more of the galaxy.   Oh yes, and there's zombies, too. Good times.
3668	1	a	Total War is the Best Game with Cool Graphics!
3294	1	a	+
1270	0	a	'What if you could enter an object in a level and find a level inside of it? What if you could enter an object in that level and find another level inside of that?' is basically the entire point of this game, and the answer is just that it'd be a procedurally generated game like so many other indie games nowadays, but wrapped in an attempt to make some kind of fancy artistic point out of it.  Honestly, it's exactly what it looks like, though frequently far more boring than the screenshots depict. The game is described as: an 'infinite, recursive, tactical shooter'. By infinite and recursive, the designer of course means procedurally generated, and by tactical it means you'll often be sitting behind a corner waiting for the one time you can dash out without instantly dying, or choosing to run away into a different level because discretion is the better part of valor. If you're expecting good top-down shooter mechanics, look elsewhere.  The artistic point isn't worth $8, and while it managed to bamboozle me into buying the game, I have no idea how it confused reviewers like IGN's or GamePro's, who actually managed to play the game before writing their reviews. I hope.
1049	1	a	Too hard. Have to be MLG like me to have any fun whatsoever.
1517	1	a	arguably the best of tw, over rome II. a fantastic and utterly absorbing strategy game - the kind that makes you think about your next moves while you are supposed to be at work or talking to the inlaws about pruning their mulberry tree.  if you love turn based eg civ, this is another dimension. if you don't know the tw series, this is a great first stop and will absolutely grab you. anyway, enough of wasting time talking to you. those annoying swedes are compromising my northern borders and i'm trying to get my hands on mysore. and there's only 46 hours left in my weekend. bye.
4354	1	a	What can i say, old time classic, a very good game!
1315	1	a	The mist has rolled in over the atlantic, covering my British line infantry from providing support to america as the French grow in number. But out of this mist comes a sail, not one sail, but 11 more. Those ships a all have two decks lined with 15 guns. How can my lightly armed crew withstand such assualt. There's no hope in running, my ships are to slow. What to do? I've got it. But I've only got four ships! Do it anyway I line two of my vessels horizontally so that the guns are aiming straight at the enemy, slowly aproaching with all 11 of their battleships. My other two vessels get ready to swing around the line of ships I set, just waiting. They're close enough. FIRE Ship plows through FIRE Ship plows through FIRE Ship plows through FIRE Ship decides to retreat. It's to damaged to return, but the other 10 begin to turn their hulls so that the can fire.  Perfect! They've sailed close enough. I bring my ships out from behind under the cover of cannon shells. The easily flank the ships, as they are smaller, the manueverablility is much higher. The cannons tear through 2 ships hulls as they sink to the ground. While there is still chaos of a split force, I bring my two ships up in a frontal assauslt. If you can imagine, I have two ships plowing into the enemy line, while the other two have flanked them and make sure they can't flank. I end up winning with one ship lost and the other three having severe damage. The enemy's lost all of their ships. My ships reach america with the supplies. 9 / 10 would rek again.
2524	1	a	This is by far the best strategy game I've ever played. The battles get very intense and you dont need to muck skill to enjoy it like I did.
969	1	a	Very fun take on the castle defense genre. Fans of Dungeon Defender will likely find this to be a must-play.
372	1	a	Welcome to customs, please follow the sparking lines here and here, they'll lead you to your death... filthy immigrants. Yet the game raises actual questions of modern society... it's still fun.
2831	1	a	This game is one of my favorite games because if you like TBS and RTS games this has it both on land and on sea and people complain 'that all the line infantry are the same model just diffrent colors' well if you look at the Ottoman empire they have diffrent models and there are some bugs like in battle and your line infantry can't hit the broad side of a barn at point blank range while at their maximum range they can gun down any unit with precicsion and such if you don't like the bugs get the Darth mod which fixes the bugs for FREE, but the detail put into this game is just amazing when your troops fire and you hit the pause selection on the timer the musket balls are really there same with the cannon shot and same with naval warfare so if you want to play a game that challenges you to be a worthy leader of a country then play this game.
2017	1	a	Only playable with Darth Original: 6/10 if you dont encounter any bugs that CA didn't fix and wont fix Darth: 8/10 it's gr8 m8
4576	1	a	get it it spells out SPAZ.  coming soon to a cinema game shop near you  rebels empires titans â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s derbyshire  get it it spells out SATAN

3939	1	a	369 Hrs of game play. If that is not a recommendation than what is?????
1029	1	a	Kind of a Tower Defense game. Except you use traps, and you attack yourself too. Running around, shooting, stabbing, and exploding stuff.  It is a ton of fun, a crap ton of unique levels. At least try the demo!  WARNING: EXTREMELY FRIGGN ADDICTING
4028	1	a	an awesome game that represents american history very well 
2527	1	a	You establish a true global Empire in this game. Simply awesome.
4493	1	a	You are a group of mercenaries, traveling through randomly generated galaxy, gathering resources - actually there is only one main resource - 'rez'. You're trying to reach the galaxy core to discover the origin of 'rez'. That's how the story looks like, pretty simplistic, but by no means boring. SPAZ is almost completely non-linear - You can visit a lot of galaxy sectors without touching the main storyline.   Gameplay reminds me of another great game 'Escape Velocity Nova'. You build ships, gather resources, research new technologies, fight against 4 game factions - Civilians, UTA, Zombies and sometimes Bounty Hunters. Built-in tutorial is all You need to learn basics of SPAZ.  SPAZ features top-down 2D graphics, and I find it a big advantage - everything is nice and simple. Sounds are also good, music nicely blends into the gameplay.  To sum this up - If you're a fan of space games, at least try SPAZ - it's a true gem among the genre.  PROS: Nice 2D graphics Non-linear gameplay, high replayability Easy to learn, difficult to master RPG elements Lots of ships to discover  CONS: Combat can be frustrating at higher difficulties Becomes repetitive at times
4203	1	a	What can i say one of my favorite games  if u buy it get the minor factions revenge mod
3925	1	a	Loved the detail and depth of the game could do with a few more villages to expand as regions grow, but other than that hours of enjoyment.
4946	1	a	I never played this game and it still says I can write a review! 11/10
3988	1	a	Making masts of ships topple since 2009.
2219	1	a	&gt;be le me  &gt;be playing this le game &gt;something le epoc happens  haha 10/10  add me on â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥
3924	1	a	This game is great but lacks the charm of Rome or Medieval. The infamous warscape engine works well with 18th century warfare so i can deal with the no unit collision aspect. The game has a turn based campaign but the fun begins with the battles. I love this games battles i love sorounding the enemy and destroying them. The campaign map has added towns where you can specialise them. But i don't like how they made the buildings a bit simplistic. I like romes buildings becuase i could specialise a city to become a militarised or a town for growth or even a trading hub. The game's battles are fun you can take down larger armies by using woods and skimishers. I love taking pot-shots and the enemy. I enjoyed this game a lot becuase it is set in the 1700s my favorite time in history. But the kinda bombed on the Naval battles. I would give this game a 8/10. I would recomend this to anyone who has played total war and any historians.
1154	1	a	I'm mixed about this game. I've been polaying it for quite a while, but somehow I can't seem to either love it nor hate it.  First of, I love this style of game. You control a hero and a small party, and you walk on a fogged map discovering locations, enemies and quests. I've had a lot of fun with a similar one (Expeditions: Conquistador) and so I thought I'd try this one out.  You start with a kind of cliche history about demons, the end of the world and all that. Since I'm not a native english speaker, I felt like they could've added sulbtitles so I wouldn't get so lost and disconnected about the history. After the intro, you get a nice tutorial, which explains pretty much all the basics of the game (altough the different factions and units are not explained at all, so each one you play with you'll have to see it for yourself what suits you better by trial and error). After that, you're all set to play the campaign.  First of, I think the narrator did a very nice job. All of them read pretty nicely the texts that open each act from each faction. Problem is, that's al lthe voice acting you get. The rest is just at the beggining or after battles and it's the same sound over and over again. The history is presented to you at the beggining of the acts and while playing them, by non spoken dialogue.  For me the game started fun (on hard mode), I would walk and take my time to kill every monster and discover every part of the map (which is what the developers wanted, I guess). But some monsters are impossible to beat on any given map on the early stages of the game, even with a full party with max lvl soldiers.  The graphics are neither top notch nor bad, they fit decently into the game's theme. Only visual problem I had was with some long dialogues being cut by the 'continue' buttom you must press after each characther has spoken. So you kind of miss some information. Couldn't the devs have made a scroll bar or just have the person say something in two dialogues instead of one?  Anyways, the fun I've had in the previous 30 hours gave place to a feeling of boredom. I mean, after all you just go from map to map doing the same thing over and over, there are two or three secondary quests tops and the only thing keeping you forward is a little piece of history given to you before each act. And there are a lot of acts from all the factions. So you play each act for about 5 hours or more (if you kill every guy like me) and then there is 5 more lines of history and then 5 more hours doing the same thing. It gets boring pretty fast, especially if you don't like this kind of game.  What keeps it better is that you can kind of 'auto-resolve' a battle to make the game run faster, but the AI is so stupid that even aganist the weakest enemies you can lose one or two soldiers because the AI chooses to advance with only one guy aganist 7, even though you have 5 guys to attack (Idk why its so stupid since the AI of the enemy computer, altough not very bright, isn't that stupid).  My veredict is that, if you like this kind of strategy games, give this one a try, especially if on sale. I'll be fun for quite a while. But be warned that you'll be bored before knowing how the history ends. If you're going to go all the way to the end is up to you. I, myself, don't know if I will.

687	1	a	Great tower defense game. If you haven't played this, you're an asshat.
4501	1	a	I really enjoyed this game - fun, quirky and progresses at a good rate. Some good RPG elements that can sometimes be overshadowed by spam building spaceships and just throwing them at the enemy, hoping it will be enough.
4349	1	a	Nice Total War
443	1	a	An excellent game, it combines tower defense with action...Thumbs up!!!
2015	1	a	Great depth and challenge. Line Infantry overload but that was the manner of warfare.
5102	1	a	suprisingly good game
1829	1	a	I bought this title for the extra content rather than Napoleon. I looked over the flaws of this game. I really enjoy it. MULTIPLAYER PLAYERBASE IS STILL HUGE 155+ DAILY FROM MORNING TO NIGHT. Not even kidding. DLC's are worth it in my opinion. Get them on sale before it ends on Jan. 2 Play with me on mp. I'm better than average. BUY THIS GAME YOU WONT REGRET. Mods for this are awesome I swear.
815	1	a	It's strangely addicting to set up diabolical traps for hundreds of orcs to meet their collective doom.
2056	1	a	  Good game, fun to rek Ben in a 1v1
745	1	a	Army of Darkness meets Plants vs. Zombies. Auf Englisch extrem gut!
5033	1	a	there is somthing about this game that is almost zen like, i tend to play in quick bursts or sink over 2 hours at a time into it  i would say you should get it and keep an eye out for the second game coming out soon(ish)
3861	1	a	One of, if not, the best strategy games I have played. I like to think of it as a limited CIV 5, but you control the armies in battle.
1728	1	a	One of the Most Realistic strategy games of all time. This game has everything from large scale battles to skirmishes to massed cavalry assaults. Empire Total war is a must buy along with its successor: Napoleon total war and its predecessors: Medieval and rome total war.
1938	1	a	With a friend it is so intense yet fun at the same time 10/10  Pros- Graphics Multiplayer Works Fun Combat Cool Units Massive Scale  Cons- Unit Pathways can be wonkey
1689	1	a	As a long time fan of the Total War series, I have to say this is my favourite. This and Medieval II are the ones in the series one can replay the most &amp; still enjoy the game as if it were the first time playing. If you're a fan of strategy games &amp; are looking for a good game to get you going or you're already a veteran at strategy games &amp; want another challenge, Empire: Total War is for you!
5268	1	a	An arcade-like game with old school graphics and game-play that is lots of fun.  Build up your tech tree as you move from system to system, persuing the over-arching mission. Every system presents a new chance for local missions; choose some locals to help or fight as you make your way to more difficult systems.  Salvage hull designs to build your fleet. Set the AI of your companions to suit your objectives. Jump into the pilots seat of any vessle you have in the map.  Build and outfit different hulls for different roles and swap between them in a quick, easy way.  The whole thing adds up to being a blast to play.  As a bonus, the developers seem like a stand up bunch. Throwing them enough for a beer is little enough recompense for the many hours of fun I have had with their creation.  Five Stars. Would Kill Space Zombies Again.
4490	1	a	Despite the odd title, this is a fun game if you like 2D space action, like collecting new ships and weapons, and don't mind having to grind a bit if you do poorly for awhile.   SPaZ is a top down space combat game where you mine resources and fight other ships. You gain power by gaining favor with two factions and buying weapon blueprints. You get ship blueprints from beating those ships. For me, getting those blueprints and seeing what each new ship or weapon could do was the most fun part of the game. There are many different types of equipment and you have limited upgrade points, so you'll have to pick a few trees to go down until late game when you can really pack on the level up. This gives the game some replayability if you like.  Combat is fun and you have a lot of options. You can put out a big, expensive ship and just mow down enemies, or you can put out a small fast ship that can't take much damage. While the small ships do die quickly, they are much less expensive, making it an important issue to consider. If you get low on resources, you can't build your big ships and have to either do easy missions or go mine. There are places to do so relatively safely, but that's the slight grind I mentioned.  I only had two issues with the game. The first relates to the factions. There are two and in each system they will have different feelings toward you. If you make them happy or mad in one system, it won't affect them in another. This is actually good. The problem is that one faction is always the one blocking the warp gates leading to other sectors. They must be cleared before you can move on. So you must either bribe the guards, which is extremely expensive, or attack them and â¥â¥â¥â¥ them off.   The second problem is that the end game got very boring and 'samey' as I cleared system after system. However, that was me being completionist. You can finish the game without doing so but more systems cleared will give more aid in the last battle.   Overall, I had a lot of fun. I'm not ready to jump into a second playthrough yet, but I'm happy with the time spent with this game and I will be keeping an eye on the second.
2715	1	a	One of the best Total war from the series.
3407	1	a	I believe that the creative assembly really hit the nail on the head with Empire Total War. Although I think that the siegebattles had greatley decreased in customizability from medeivel total war 2 I still think this was one of the best stratagy battle style games. The one thing I have never liked in total war campaigns is how there is always riots in my cities that i'm never sure how to sort out. But I still feel that Empire total war is my 2nd faveroute game in the series Rome total war 1 is my number one (as I havn't tried Rome 2 yet) and Medieval 2 as my 3rd and Shogun 2 as my 4rth. As the creative Assembley produce great sequals I can't wait for the return of Empire total war.
4338	1	a	One of my favorite Total War games, next to the first Rome game. Some aspects of the battles can definitely be improved, but the campaign strategy aspect of the game is nearly perfect. It is always a challenge for me, depending on what country I am playing as.
2562	1	a	real good rts and turn based. Naval combat is a good addition  Good graphics
878	1	a	I downloaded the demo on both Steam and XBLA and was so blown away that I jumped at the first sale of the game on Steam and fully intend to get it on XBLA whenever it goes on sale there as well. Definitely one of those 'must own' titles for me.
2111	1	a	Love it!!! 
4777	1	a	i dont even remember playing this game.. it isnt even in my library, yet it still says i've played it? wat i guess i'll recommend it, even though i havent (or remember) played it before
1383	1	a	Empire: Total War... where to start, where to start....  After 130 hours spent on this game, I can only disrcibe it with one word: spectacular. I have been an RTS fan since early on, played all the great names from Command &amp; Conquer to Wh40k: Dawn of War. Of all these games, Empire:TW brought the biggest satisfaction. The game might be getting old now, but it`s glory doesn't fade. Even if you never played Total War games before, this is a must buy for any RTS fan. Starting from the graphics. Like said, some time passed since it`s release, but never the less, when put on max. settings it is still beautiful. The sound is done quite well. I enjoy every round of shots made from the infantery, the roar of canons, the thousands of feet marching to the beat of the drum, the hissing of primitive missiles in the air..... The game itself gives you a lot of feautres. The two singleplayer modes let you play as some of the greatest nations of the time, from Prussia to the Maratha Confederacy (the other SP mode let`s you play as the United States on their way to independence). Your job is to form alliances, make trade, conquer areas, defeat your enemies, develop your nation, and if you feel like it, you can always coup the monarchy and establish a republic. The campaign itself is turn based, moving your armies and agents in a pre-set range of movement each season, governing your cities and doing some diplomacy along the way. The battles on the other hand are real-time, but you can change the speed of battle from slow-motion all the way to fast. The map on which you play on is determined by the region you are fighting in. Battles can be either the classical land battles, sieges or naval battles. If you don't feel like doing a battle, but you have good chances, simply click autoresolve (save the battle just in case you get defeated). The multiplayer is also quite good, letting several players play as their favourite nation and setting up their army. You can join your friends and fight bots, do 1v1, or a large scale battle of up to 6 players 3v3. Words simply can't desribe the awesomeness of this game, but at least I tried. Buy it, just do it, you won't make a mistake.
2600	1	a	 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX9XFuBpHVQ  Part 1, Lasts around 12 minutes.Focuses on the Grand Campaign  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a82HR3JMYKM  Part 2.Also lasts around 12 minutes.Focuses on land and naval battles 
5192	1	a	I logged over a hundred hours on this puppy! It is a LOT of fun. Five cents an hour for great fun? Can't beat it.
5081	1	a	Great game and doesn't require amazing specs to play.
2345	1	a	A good game for simple desires, I myself wanted a large realistic battle game, but it seems like just a taste of of it, if the graphics are too good, then its laggy, if they are low, then it's not as fun because it doesn't feel real. There is no medium. Also you can only play as a smal handful of the Nations.
3759	0	a	You spend more time looking at loading screens and waiting for AI to make its turn, than acxtually play the game... which mostly consist of making endless province improvements.
2396	1	a	Awesome game, it's totaly worth the money.
609	1	a	Loads of fun! Not a very long experience, unless you try to perfect every level, but totally worth it!
1893	1	a	Can kill natives 8/10
3993	1	a	Approved!
3329	1	a	Yes I become addicted to this game for a very long time and even better it has many RP groups. 9/10-Badass seal of approval
4306	1	a	*Me choosing faction*  England? Already played that faction on Medieval II France? Ehh maybe next time.  Russia? No thanks.  Poland? Now that's a faction with some heart!   So begin the Musket and Tymbark Wars. 9/10
1952	0	a	This game had so much potential, but it just falls flat in every regard. Poor AI, dull units fighting in an even duller style of combat, awful ship battles that always descened into total chaos, and poor diplomacy. Not worth a buy. I recommend Shogun II. That's much better.
2823	1	a	This game is quite good in combat, in some good areas of campaign and maybe a little bit of multiplayer. However I'm dissapointed in the acheivements. I play many nations in the grand campaign on easy and normal to earn the the level acheivements, however I still didn't get it. I even conqured india to earn that conquest of india acheivement and I still didn't get it. This game has screwed me over the acheivements, however if u play all the nations and still have fun with the multiplayer ur going to love it.
1242	1	a	I got this on sale for 60% Off. This is a really fun game to un-wind with; casual, easy, fun and addictive. There are plenty of Steam achievements to make it more interesting too, but no trading cards. Check a youtube video to get a feel for gameplay dynamics. Kick back and mow-down the incoming mechanized infantry and armor when you need to take a break from your favorite RPG first-person-shooter.
5018	1	a	A top-down shmup with customiseable ships, RPG elements related to tech, randomised galaxies, and missions... Really. What's there not to like? Has some nice splashes of humor, too. Very beautiful and rather addictive and the controls are simple and elegant. I hope the expansions continue, 'cuz I can't get enough of this game.
10	1	a	This game actually turned out to be a lot more fun than I thought it would be. Stragtigically placing all the wonderfully wicked traps to kill as many Orcs as possible before they get to the point where you have to fend them off is a great challange. Picking your traps is fun considering there are many to choose from. traps are also upgradable which is definatley a nice touch. Would I recommend this game, yes to anyone. So why not go on over and get your copy now and while you are there grab Orcs must die 2 and the DLC....I did!
4430	0	a	Game is fun but keeps crashing and is laggy to â¥â¥â¥â¥, massive joke â¥â¥â¥â¥ you needs fixing
2999	1	a	carl is an awesome llama
2768	1	a	Strategy time waster. Glorified RISK game with side army battles. Fun if you have a lot of time and want to manipulate everything about an economy and 1700's battle.
4426	0	a	Game is fun but keeps crashing and is laggy to â¥â¥â¥â¥, massive joke â¥â¥â¥â¥ you needs fixing
4933	1	a	I went into a special mission and got ambushed by a UTA Flagship  10/10 would die without saving again
2552	1	a	im to the point where my game freezes every time i end turn and it is iritating other than that the game is fun when it works
5053	1	a	Crazy addictive. Once of the best indie games I've played.
3952	1	a	This is (in my opinion) the best total war series game by far. It adds a good balance of strategy and pure combat, astounding graphics and definatly worth the money.
552	1	a	Orcs Must Die! That is all that is to be said about this game it is amaze balls
5172	1	a	My only issues were...  Pacing: It felt like it took forever to upgrade the mothership and I ended up using the same ships for hours. Also if you need resources it's kind of a grind to accumulate them. And the upgrade system kind of keeps you locked with regard to what weapons you use. Switching to a different weapon type costs you all of the upgrade bonuses which typically doesn't work.  Saving the game: If you get invaded when going to the mothership to save, you could be forced to fight another 10-15 minutes of ships and reinforcements before you can save the game. I just ended up getting bored of playing and quit without saving.
106	1	a	Orcs Must Die! 2 is one of my all time favourite games. So when I checked out the original Orcs Must Die!, I was pleasantly surprised. This game is pretty much just Orcs Must Die! 2 singleplayer, and if you're a fan of the sequel, you should definently check this game out. 9\10, and yes I am a fanboy.
3928	0	a	Terrible game showing the clear slide of CA isn't making terrible games.
1622	1	a	I love all Total war :)
530	1	a	Fun in that it becomes addictive, and you get satisfaction out of getting your fix.
5213	1	a	Lots of fun exploring the galaxy, upgrading your ships and of course, fighting off zombies. Decent story. Just a well-made game with no glaring flaws.
2425	1	a	Great game, countless hours of fun after all the patches ( was extremely buggy when released) I'd buy this one over again over all the others (except mabe Medieval II: Total War)
5059	1	a	A decent Space RPG game, who I wish there where more ships and a longer story :( Worth the price.
1164	0	a	Not the same as Disciples 2, combat sucks and story is boring.
2681	1	a	Hours of fun. Play Med or hard level.
996	1	a	very addicting!
4960	1	a	Zombies and Pirates in space blowing eachother to pieces.. how is any part of that not badass?
1198	1	a	in the campaigne there is abug inthe first act of the hordes campagne...got me frustrated....
1869	0	a	Great idea, rubbish AI, diplomacy poor, duelling cut sequences broken, battles pointless as too easy to beat computer
2405	1	a	This Game is better than all of the total war games. They need to make more games like this!
2740	1	a	One of the best games I have ever played. It has come a long way since first coming out, now the AI serves as a worthy opponent. 600 hours on record, speaks for itself
681	1	a	Best TD game I've ever played.
348	1	a	Are you a racist scumbag who believes orcs must die? If so, then buy Orcs Must Die!
1910	1	a	empire total war is one of my favourite games and thats because it focuses on a really intresting historical period, has lots of content the interface is very nice and clean, it introduced naval battles that were above average it has technologies and a good goverment system.The agents feel a little bit sub par compared to the improved shogun 2 but in some cases are better that the medieval 2 ones. The AI can be pretty â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ and there are a lot of bugs, most of them though have been fixed with patches. The DLC are not great but they aren't garbage even though you get little content for the price.The negotiation system is pretty bad, and the relations between nations is a mixed bag. I liked how the buildings works and trade is awesome. The generals though were pretty bad and gimmicky since you could win an otherwise unwinnable battle just by recruiting a bunch of them on the spot. I don not recommend this game to those that dont like this kind of warfare since some believe that watching lines of soldiers firing bullets at each other is pretty boring, as for me i really liked it especially when you get to research platoon firing.It's really addicting and very rarely annoying.
5163	1	a	This is a game of a style (had I the time and the talent) I have always wanted to make. It's a very pleasant combination of genres. The closest game I can think of that would be similar is Starscape.  Shoot asteroids for resources, kill ships for xp and crew. Defeat a new type of ship and you get their blueprint. Get enough of that blueprint and you can build that ship. Blast your way through blockades, or trade and bribe your way past.  The loadout interface is surprisingly easy. It's fun experimenting with different components and weapons on different hardpoints of different hulls. Do I add a way stronger blaster and hope I don't run out of reactor power in the middle of a fight? Do I prefer speed or maneuverability? Cloak or shields? Bombs, drones, torpedoes or missiles? Tracking turrets or forward-facing sheer oomph?  The middle-end of the game gets a bit grindy, but the collector/completionist in me still has plenty to do. The developers are cool and keep adding stuff!
4854	1	a	Strangely similar to EVE Online but without the other players and 20 mins to travel from one place to another. I was plesantly surprised by this game, and can see myself getting plenty of hours of enjoyment for a bargain price tag.
2027	0	a	Started playing this game again, forgotten just how often these Total War games crash :(  And the AI, really? Hardest difficulty means every single faction declares war on you? Sheesh...  Three continents means too much micromanagement Naval strategy eludes me entirely Loooove the series, loathe this instance  4/10
506	1	a	I think this game is not only strategy but also need a speed to click your mouse to defeat the ORCS
2598	1	a	My favorite Total War game, looks great ands set in an interesting era. It's a must-buy game if you like strategy games.
1518	1	a	Very nice Real time strategy game
2948	1	a	This game is one of the best games I have ever played. Period.
1800	1	a	One of the best strategy games you'll ever play.  I played this offline quite a lot, and honestly I keep returning to it as I discover more and more little tips and tricks to get ahead. It's a little Empress-wannabes dream.
4911	1	a	I want to say that it is a simple game with all those elements that anyone should be able to pick out and say 'yeah, that's fun' but that's not the case. This game is great. At times I want to rage-quit and stomp around swearing, and others I want to find the two guys that put this together and shake their hands. Either way they did it right. I haven't found any bugs aside from a spelling error, and things seem to work well for what appears to be a simple game that is in fact possessed of a level of complexety. This game is win.
1751	1	a	10/10
3382	1	a	one of the greatest strategy games on the pc, with a great mix of turn based and rts gameplay. best played with darthmod though.
490	1	a	I got this on sale for less than the price of a piece of cheese at the local convenience store.  Pros: For a game released in 2011 the graphics are still holding up strong Solid Third Person Shooter/Tower Defense game with a challenge that doesn't feel intimidating. Simple, fun, seemingly arcade style gameplay. Music is basic, appropriate, and not annoying. Better than cheese, and I really like cheese.  Cons: I waited to long to find out that Orcs Must Die! I still want a piece of cheese.
1276	0	a	Of all the hipster indie trash I've played, this is by far the most pretentious and pointless.
667	1	a	ONE HELL OF A GAME,  you are missing out if you donât get this game, with varied levels, weapons/traps and enemies all combined into this small but brilliant game.  itâs a game you can just relax to, set traps and watch your enemies die or get stuck in killing as many Orcs as you can.  Well worth the buy even at full price.
1184	0	a	It's alright I mean. The combat becomes tedious and kind of boring. Honestly might be worth a skip, the story is pretty meh too. Don't expect your leaders to do much of anything. The enemies will have 1000 hp and your leader can only hit 10-25. In 8 hours of playing I have only hit a few bugs. One made it so that I was stuck on act one for a long time. I had to keep clicking this log until a goblin came.
270	0	a	God dammit, you can't remap the keys AT â¥â¥â¥â¥ING ALL. Even at the sale price, I want my â¥â¥â¥â¥ing money back.
4321	1	a	This is a good game for reenacting battles from many wars fought during the 18th century. 10/10 would revolutionary war again. only negative is the Horrible musket sounds.
896	1	a	both strategic and hilarious. great game. I absolutely loved it. Hoping for orcs must die 3
794	1	a	While writing this review, I have not yet beaten this game. In fact, I'm pretty sure I still have ways to go. However, after quite a bit of anticipation, I'm glad to say that this game is worth its weight. Its a unique spin to a genre that is getting more popular and offers a ton of variety. Without having to due any calculation whatsoever in terms of placing down this or that, I simply go with what I prefer. There is plenty of choice and strategy.    The flow of the game goes quite well with its style of humor and aesthetics. It reminds me a bit of Heretic/Hexen in terms of weaponry/magic and the music strikes a resembling similarity to Warcraft 2.   My only complaint is the lack of multiplayer. While a great game on its own, having the ability to play with someone else would make it much much more entertaining. However, one can only hope that it will be future content... otherwise I'll just get Dungeon Defenders when it is released.  5/5 Rating
1865	1	a	Easily my favourite Total War game. There's bad parts to it of course, however that does stop that satisfying feeling of watching Swedish line infantry slaughter Russian troops.
2331	1	a	i recomend you get it it is worth it trust me 
3553	1	a	This game is absolutely captivating. Stunning graphics, amazing physics, fun and violent gameplay. Hours of your life will be spent glued to this game!
2354	1	a	Native Americans conquered Canada.  8/10
3013	1	a	A promising concept that's hamstrung in a numerous ways; oversimplified campaign map that makes conquering countries a child's affair; americo-centric design principles concentrate an uneven amount of attention for what amounts to a tiny period in the whole affair, a case of the DLC's and of course, the last hundred years cut off to serve up as a semi-sequel a few months later.  To play Devil's advocate, the naval combat is excellent, land battles are believable and enjoyable, research and population are managed better than previous titles and the overall feel is less clunky than its predecessors.   The AI remains a schizophrenic insane diplomat in the strategic map, and goes from Napoleon's protege to lobotomised monkey depending on the alignment of the planets, and often carelessly runs its cavalry into stakes or gun lines.  Definitely worth a look, but it disappoints mostly in the prospect of what it could have been with less interference from SEGA.
5026	1	a	This is one of the best space games I have ever reviewed. O cons. Some people might not like it because of the 2D, but being able to buy new space weapons, construct new ships and beating up zombies just pays it off.
3908	1	a	Absolutely yes and the modding capabilities make it a great buy.
2173	0	a	Still crashes at random to this day. Different computer, still crashes.
4216	1	a	Absolutely love this game. One of my favourites and one that I keep coming back and playing time and time again.
1819	1	a	Love this game and tactics involved in battles!!
1338	1	a	E:TW provided strange but outstanding Total War experience. It was one of the worst games in the series from the technical point of view, with all its bugs and connection issues only outmatched by the horror of Rome 2 itself. But for the reasons I can't fully understand it was a keeper. Maybe that was about a fresh setting, diverse landscapes, revamped city-building, comfortable pacing, huge world to fight for or the first buggy steps into co-op multiplayer, but as a matter of fact it has a sweet nostalgic aftertaste Napoleon or Shogun 2 didn't leave for me. IF CA fixed at least some of its problems, it is definitely worth visiting while waiting for the next installment in TW series.
1765	1	a	One of the better Total War games I've played... Started my Total War experience with Medieval Total War, then to Rome, Medieval II, Empire, Shogun 2 and Rome II... All great games, for me I would have to place this game at #2 to Medieval II Total War... Tons of content and story and endless hours or pure entertainment... I haven't even tried any of the mods yet but I'll get there when I start to feel the game is lacking as for now it's been years and they are all great games. Good luck, Happy Hunting...
2636	1	a	Easily the best Total War game on record. It had it's issues at the start, but this game I believe will stand as the one of the defining Total War games for many years.  Unlike the Rome: TW which spanned Europe, North Africa and the western Middle East, Empire is a global game. You can build your empire on the Indian subcontinent, the North American colonies, and colonial Europe. Additionally, naval forces (which you can FINALLY control like ground troops) have four 'trade route' locations they can operate in on top of the 3 main theaters.  I would highly recommend this game.
1878	1	a	played as russia took me,5 or 6 turns to build economy. decides who to invade crimea or sweden. invades sweden calls allies. allies dont help sweden,kills sweden in 15 turns. sweden rebels 40 turns later. kill all the rebel scum. europe hates me now. I backstab polad-lutiuania 100 turns later russia owns europe. 5 turns in revolution happens. 2 turns destroys revolution  10/10 russia stronk
3754	1	a	Very good game if you are into Strategy. A few minor bugs, but nothing to get huffy about. Very good graphics as well.
3472	1	a	Great game to play, fun and entertaining!
1725	1	a	My favourite Total Warâ¢ game so far.
2502	1	a	I like this game becuase it gives you a challenge and also gives you an insight to what battles where like back in the oldern times. This game has good graphics, nice display, good combat mechanics, realistic plains. even if some of the battles seem to have a thousand soldiers per squad or platoon. I'd give this game an 8/10
2309	0	a	Doesn't work.. Everytime when I try to upload a battle.. It crashes... WTH?! The DEMO is the only thing that works
1389	1	a	Very good game, I recommend it to anyone who wants to explore the world and fight savages and be a warlord!
4289	1	a	love this game but it needs more units in game maybe just dlc but its cool MURICA!!!!
2918	1	a	awesome game! even better with a 7.2 surround sound
5183	1	a	
3874	1	a	An amazing game even to this day in 2014!!
4559	1	a	WOW!!!! This game is absolutley amazing! I've been hooked every since I've installed it. Great blend of R.P.G and top down shooter mixed with elements of strategy. Easy controls, great voice clips (I laughed out loud), awesome story, colurful level design and an overall visual aesthetic that is a work of art. Tons of missions and side missions in a huuuuuge galaxy that you explore at your own leisure. For a two man indie company to produce such a fine game, it renews my faith that the little guys can compete with the big development giants, but just on a different level. I was almost choked up when in the opening screen the developers leave a very personal message thanking you for buying it.  I will be playing this game for a very long time.  Bravo MinMax!  and to everyone else  BUY THIS GAME!!!!
4240	1	a	It is a awesome but time killing game 8.5/10
4586	1	a	This one was a lot of fun. Building up resources, leveling tech, exploring space, and pretty fun battles. I'm hoping that there is a part two at some point.
1927	1	a	no one plays this anymore
3961	1	a	The Russians took over Crimea. 10/10 for realism.
4604	1	a	A great little game. The combat is fun and the visuals are nice. It can get a little repetitive, but the game throws some gameplay changes in later in the game.
3717	1	a	its pretty fun
9	1	a	Nice tower defense-ish game. Basically you have to control the flow of Orcs in such a way that you manage to kill them all (either with traps or by yourself).  I think it is quite a good game. Also you can get it cheap enough as it currently is in the Humble (Jumbo) Bundle.
4812	1	a	I love this sort of game. if you die, its your own fault. you tried the mission, you get the reward of diying. also i love the fact that the first ships you get are extremely cheap. and you can go mining with those, and then... you stock up and get bigger ships. then bigger.. The even bigger. then you get huge.  get this. i havent bought it yet.  also, i SPAZed when i saw this. hehe.
3802	1	a	THIS GAME IS AWESOME!!!! I love this game sooooo much i've spent (at the moment) 50+ hours on the game and whenever i get on my computer this is the first thing that comes to mind when thinking of something to play.
2973	1	a	I put some 2000 hours on this awesome game. It has plenty of features and the hours of fun. You should like the historical battles and real opponents.
2892	1	a	Empire: Total War is a fun game challenging game, you play in three theatres of war, Europe, Americas and India.
1500	1	a	Absolute best turn based stratagy game out there.
4320	1	a	Yes great game you need a fast com and graphics board and it still crashs takes ages to install but appart from that its fun ,cool graphics, sound, AI is good could be better but fun over all.
3473	1	a	Wow what â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t 14 $ one day and the next day its 3 bucks what a ripoff good job steam. 
626	1	a	Amazingly addictive and fun to play.
5298	1	a	A great game and time shredder. As it was said by the developers themselves it is a game like the old ones that seem to not be built anymore nowadays. It's combination of real time combat with round based development progress are come along great. The visial representation is awesome. The gameplay has way more depth then one expects initially and the storyline is catchy. And Zombies. In Space!  Warning: Addictive!
4176	1	a	Empire Total War is actually the first PC game i have ever gotten and i still enjoy playing it. Empire Total War is basically Creative Studios attempt to try many innovative ideas, and include the other stuff in their older games. It is really fun to play especially with friends. Here are some pros and cons:  PROS: Tons of factions to play as  Lots of units to choose from Replayability Many different historical leaders/ generals are in the game Units are based on their historical counterparts  Campaigns are really fun and unique Many DLC's to expand each faction's unit roster  CONS: There are no multiplayer campaigns (empire was made before multiplayer campaigns) Glitches are non abundant but there are still some sprinkled in the game I have found the npc's are pretty easy to fight not many people play anymore so you will have a harder time tring to play multiplayer  All in all empire total war is an oldie but a goodie 
803	1	a	This or Dungeon Defenders or Monday Night Combat or... well, approach the notion with this question: do I have ANY friends at all? If the echoing response happens to be a sheepish '...no...' then call Orcs Must Die your newest and only bud.  Orcs Must Die shares more in common with the likes of Lock's Quest than any of the previously mentioned seige-style titles. You, as the Apprentice, are the sole line of defense for a series of interdimensional whatsits. Good, hands-on slaughter earns bonuses; creative execution of traps earn you multipliers. This set up should dispell for you where the focus of Orcs Must Die sits: action first, clever second.
4953	1	a	A surprisingly deep space opera, considering it's price tag. Travel to the galactic core in search of riches, building ships and researching technology along the way. 2D combat is fun, you can tweek your ships depending on component designs you bought or pillaged and the game gives you quite a bit of choice on how you reach your goals. Kept me engaged to the end.
1522	1	a	This game keeps you coming back for more. For set battles or for some nation building, Empire Total War has long been a standard go to when unable to decide what to play.
4197	1	a	awsome game love the grafics i like how you can only be the major powers and not the minor powers like saxony or denmark all in all a good game to pass the time
5105	1	a	It is rare to see this tyoe of game but I welcome it. Very fun to play. I just wish there where more like it.
5042	1	a	do u even zombies bro well this game does spaz is a game about space exploration the first thing you want to do is take off and explore but dont go too fast or youll get blown up by a much larger ship XD i dont want to spoil too much but the blank blank is a zombie spy'ish gather recoucers make ships get them blown up make more i just have one more thing to say BUY THIS GAME FOR CRYING OUT LOUD JUST BY. ps blank blank is a spy (-i-) d (U)
3269	1	a	Oh â¥â¥â¥â¥ Bily is dead!!! everyone â¥â¥â¥â¥ing retreat!!!
4979	1	a	Who would have thought a game so simple could be so addictive!
296	1	a	I wasn't sure what to think of this, but the price was right, so I bought it. Fantastic game. I bought the DLC as well, which is not like me at all. Loving the game so far.
994	1	a	I loved this game. Just loved it, can't wait to play the sequal.
3705	1	a	If you like to conquer the world in a dramatic 17th century time period. This is a game for you!
1011	1	a	It's like lemmings, except instead of babying them along you kill them in a creative way. Oh it's tower defense too.
747	1	a	I felt like dungeon defenders was a cooler version of this game, orcs were kinda lifeless and the traps and weapons didn't offer much satisfaction when slaughtering the enemy.. for me a game needs solid foundation and this one didn't hold any emotional connection to the mindless action.. but theres more action goin on in yer parents bedroom. I'd have to say this crap is wack, and the second game might have improved to a better standard. the intro video got one good laugh and that I will never forget, but I have moved on from this heaping pile of dog fecal.. to better things. 1/10
2774	1	a	Its fun
271	0	a	Unfunny; floaty and inaccurate gameplay; and forced mouse acceleration.
4942	1	a	Verry good example of awsome indie game developed only by tow persons... GOOD JOB :)
182	1	a	this is very fun and unique, played through it many times and it encourages you to go back and perfect the game. Reminds me of plants vs zombies in its addictiveness.
4902	1	a	I really love this game. It's simple, to the point, and contains a lot of quality mindless classic top down shooter features with strategy game overtones.  I'm looking forward to the sequel to this game and will be happy to pay full price since it was created by two guys that love games.
1848	1	a	 www.ilovemenandthisgame.â¥â¥â¥ 
926	1	a	Tower Defence game that has a significant Third Person action combat. Just to give you a gauge of how much the action combat impacts the game, it usually makes up 1/4 to 1/3 of my kill count. Makes build and wait a thing of the past.
4503	1	a	  Review: Space Pirates And Zombies
1059	1	a	Great Indie Tower Def game. Havent had this much fun and laughed at game in a long time!
2061	1	a	Great games. Don't loose your general
3439	1	a	Great Strategy game with alot of familar mechanics from the total war series, the battles are tactical and with the new naval combat this gives the game a fresh, dynamic feel to it which gives the player a new combat style to overcome tactically. The game are numerous game modes on offer to player, as well as challenging other players in multiplayer matches.  Overall   9/10
2603	1	a	This is an excellent game and a period of history that was dynamic and interesting. I'd go as far as to say my favourite Total War game.
2663	1	a	play as france go allied with Britain train more than 1500 troops surround britain declare war capture it in 2 turn  damn im better than Napoleon
4766	1	a	Fun space shooter/RPG. Fly your starships around blowing up enemy ships and gathering resources to buy upgrades and bribe your way into new star systems! Try and get to the center of the galaxy to solve the mystery of the space-zombies!
5173	1	a	All i can say is i LOVE this game and Really wish there was a workshop for it cos this would be awesome with mods ! :)
4701	1	a	Crashed when I wanted to travel to the second planet 10/10
1110	1	a	ÐÐ»Ð°ÑÑÐ½Ð°Ñ Ð¸Ð³ÑÑÑÐ°.   Awesome tower defense game. Strict but fun balance. Lots of traps weapons and spells. Highly recommend it.
2573	1	a	The Empire strikes back...........literally. 11/10 would play as the Brits again.
4224	1	a	&gt;am netherlands &gt;conquer india &gt;destroy farms and infrastructure  10/10 would genocide India again
404	1	a	I have never been the biggest fan of Tower Defense games. But after playing a good 7 hours of Orcs Must Die over the last 2 days, I can honestly say that this title gets a spot on my favorites list. Robot Entertainment has produced a challengeing, trhrilling, laugh out loud chaotic little gem. Nothing quite equals the satisfying feeling of frantically rushing around, strategically lining the corridors of a fortress with implements of death, and then watching your assailants fall in droves under hails of arrows, floor spikes, wall blades, and brimstone tiles. The 3rd person over the shoulder camera puts you smack in the middle of the chaos, immediatley lending the game a sense of urgency you don't feel in other TDG's simply because your character's life is in peril because your character is THERE. Humor, depth, and white knuckled pacing set the tone for a well made, fun game that is worth picking up. (Especially at such a low price.)
3721	1	a	Great game buy it. That is pretty much all that needs to be said about this game.
1770	1	a	One of my all time favorite games. Definetly the best in the series.
436	1	a	Incredibly fun, but takes a little while to get into. At first it seems like you just plow away with your crossbow, but it quickly becomes about strategy. Very entertaining graphics and physics. Gameplay is very fun, and yet still challenging. I highly recommend this game if you're into Tower Defense games.  Other games like this are Sanctum (1 and 2) and Dungeon Defenders. All of these are great games, and the FPS/TPS slash Tower Defense genre really needs more games.
3361	1	a	Great Game Would Highly Recommend it Will run on even the worst computers.
923	1	a	Perfect casual game. Kick back, relax with your Xbox360 controller and kill some orcs. Whether you decide to build an army of archers and paladins, mine the whole dungeon with spear and arrow traps, become a powerful elemental mage or mix these tactics up - gameplay is always balanced and fair, smooth and fast and addictive.
914	1	a	Now this game I spent hours on my crapy labtop, Just killing the dam orcs all day made my own day.
1811	1	a	I love this game that much when my original CD breaks, I installed this version from steam.  
3579	1	a	Epic War Game Time Consuming But Well Worth It.
4927	1	a	I was looking for a modern classic-style top-down space exploration game with modifiable ships and asteroid mining but all I could find was a bunch of pay-to-win â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t like Dark Orbit. Then I stumbled on SPAZ and honestly it's everything I wanted and more. It's open-world but structured so you don't get overwhelmed by the vastness of space.   I'm very impressed with how refined and balanced the experience is. Everything from upgrades, fighting, and leveling up has had a lot of thought put into it. This does not feel like a 2-person studio production, it plays like a passion project from a very skilled game studio.   I've played 20 hours so far, which is saying something considering most of the games in my library are barely touched regardless of their rating, and can't wait until I have time to play it more.   I'm looking forward to playing more of this game and cannot wait until SPAZ 2!
3468	1	a	This is a pretty decent game, if you like real time strategy. The graphics are amazing, if nothing else.
5286	1	a	One of the best indie games of all time.  Very well executed visual style. lots of replayability. Absolutly recommended  9/10
2310	1	a	It's fricken long.
4226	1	a	A great game.
3970	1	a	Good battles, good music, good campaign, good units. Have played Rome Total War 1 and these 2 games are about the same in quality
2585	1	a	It was ok.
2699	1	a	turn limit on every game play mode is stupid as hell but other then that its fun
4687	1	a	This game is awesome.  Absolutely recommended.
1699	1	a	THIS GAME IS AWESOME!!!
1399	1	a	Conquer! Conquer! Conquer! That's the only reason why I love Total War games! I am very fond of this one in particular due to the size of the campaign map. The use of rifles and mortars is also quite a fun addition! Ship battles can also be easily won if you have the right ship and keep your distance. Generally setting other ships on fire is the best way to scare away the enemy fleet!
2392	1	a	An army of the chervokees beat the british  10/10
2369	1	a	With the DarthMod this game is magnificent.
1675	1	a	It's ight.
4342	1	a	An excellent look at what 18th-early 19th century warfare. Unlike most games, which are mostly melee, this game relies mostly on ranged tactics, which is just how I like it.  The only thing that sucks is how buildings are spread out around the regions, giving enemies a good way to cripple the economy.
2003	1	a	Kappa/10 would conquer the world under the Swedish flag again and again and again
5052	1	a	For a two-dimensional space shooter, this game has a lot to offer. It makes me think of what EVE Online might have been if it had been concieved as a single-player game back in 1995 or so. It excells as a casual stress reliever and is pretty much guaranteed to keep a player engaged in short bursts for a good time. However, the set pieces begin to repeat themselves after a while- after all, it is still a work in progress- (In the same manner that Team Fortress 2 is a work in progress.) but a damned good one at that.
4423	1	a	I have played Medieval, Medieval 2, Empire, Napoleon, Shogun 2, Rome 2 and Attila Total War series and ETW remain my favorite. This is due to the fact that ETW has a vast map with a lot of factions to play (with mods of course). Such setting allows all kinds of possible alternative history. I am now playing as Mexico and about to colonize Mysore!
5031	1	a	The combat and progression is very fun. Also the graphics are pleasant and the story is absurd, in a good kind of way
2045	1	a	Played as The British , put both campaing dificulty and battle dificulty to Maximum. 2nd turn : every one declared war on me, 10th turn: i was invaded by the french and and died. 20/10 Literaly Total War.
892	1	a	+ Pretty good fun  - But little bit short  80/100
3761	1	a	It's fun. cool graphics and all but when the elephant unit walks from far distance, it's bad.
1747	1	a	ah yeah good crack,gets little boring after a while but still thumbs up
1738	1	a	Great strategy game, easy to jump in and just start playing. Dont really care for the naval battles but that is a small part of the game.
1557	1	a	Build your own world spanning Empire and may the sun never set on it!
1602	1	a	I've read some terrible reviews of this game- people saying that it's the low point in the series, but I loved it. I thought the theatres of operations idea was great, as were the naval battles. Trade is more important than ever and Allies ACTUALLY HELP YOU. Plus, economic and social development are fun, especially with the town system.  But...  The game doesn't really offer you a challenge. In rome on hard difficulty, everyone attacks you. On this- nope. The AI tactics are broken or non-existent, predictable and easy. Besides, the map looks horrible compared to rome. Also, the ottoman troops are automatically worse than the europeans. Besides, I don't like the fact that all the american indians and the mughals are locked out in campaign.  Overall- fun but not the best of all the TW games.
1956	1	a	Awesome game for the most part, some annoying design flaws and glitches though.
1511	0	a	Im really into game, its just pretty etc etc. And as a fan of Total War I can say its pretty good. BUT its bugged as hell, even after all those years they cant fix the autosave crashes, memory loss, corrupted saves and AI likes to freak out during the siege. Grab it for 2â¬ on some sale but the game isn't worth more. Oh and half of the achievments is bugged :)
2678	1	a	install empires, download the 100% nessissary darth mod... enjoy carnage.
2202	0	a	Tried it, canât really get into it.
1095	1	a	It's a good game if you like to place traps and have several options to win.
2898	1	a	why you should'int put your settings on max with a talking crappy no damn memory â¥â¥â¥ computer on a damn 10k USA vs 17K Native battle and putting settings on max :  *starts battle* *note pops up* (me) : Whats this *reads and say* : plz stop (me) : No (computer) : yes or i quit lyfe (me) : pfft yeah right   *smells smoke*  (me) : OH GAWD!! (computer) : bye bye to your bedroom   *computer blows up*   *buys a $ 1,000 dollor new computer*  (me) : alright... im putting everything on low.....    *hears voice and looks at burn computer*  (Burnted old computer) : I'm Back.......  (me) : NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  DA END 10/10 game if you want a new computer
3708	1	a	Pick a nation and fight for your lifes
2564	1	a	Empire: Total war is, in my opinion, the weakest of the games in the Total War franchise (though I haven't played Total War: Rome 2 yet which have received some negative reviews as well).  This game can be quite frustrating at times, especially with a fairly weak AI and a diplomatic system which feels like it makes no sense with nations fighting by even when offered very favourable terms in face of complete eradication. Especially fighting in siege battles can be really annoying on both sides as the units behave remarkably stupid in those scenarios.  Still, despite all of it's flaws I will still recommend the game because I've enjoyed playing it a lot, especially the naval battles brought a new element to this franchise which was sorely missing from previous titles (and they are bloody fun to play!). And, perhaps more crucially, this game fills a still quite vacant spot in the set time-period in the strategic games category.  So, if you like strategy games, especially the other in the Total War franchise and can survive a few bugs and a quite annoying AI then you can pick up this one up.
3042	1	a	Not as good as the old ones but still good.
2106	1	a	It's like Civilization, but you actually get to command how your troops fight; kinda like every nation is a militaristic conquesting empire.  WHAT I DID LIKE:  I really enjoy this game, there's nothing more exhiliarating than 17th and 18th century combat where people would stand in ranks and shoot at the enemy (people who have the balls to do that are respected by me).   There are many ways to go at your opponent in terms of strategy and many units are available from many nations to further increase your customization.  Managing your empire, which includes: putting down rebellions, trading with other nations, researching war technologies, assassinating an enemy's agent, or even bribing others to get what you want, is a vast and immersive part of the game I really do like.  WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE:  There are a few framerate issues if you stay in a battle for too long, if you put too many men close together, or if you create too much artillery debris. This isn't a problem with my system, as it was made with modern and top notch parts, but it seems the game can't handle these sorts of things.  Naval combat is wonky. It's not too fun and I usually skip it if I can.  Sometimes it can be very can to negotiate with nations for trade access if they keep counteroffering with a demand of money and a few of your technologies.    I give Empire: Total War a 7/10.   Buy it if it's on sale or if you want a more military oriented version of Civilization. I've really had some fun with this title, see if you will too.
3147	1	a	Fun strategy game that can teach you a bit of history.
5000	1	a	Best 10 bucks I ever spent, highly reccomend trying the demo. You'll be hooked.
2913	0	a	This game is great. But when it comes to real time battles, it's utter â¥â¥â¥â¥. When i command my cavalry they run the other way. What the actually â¥â¥â¥â¥? It's the same for the infantry.   â¥â¥â¥â¥ my army.
1094	1	a	Very good and fun 3rd person tower defense game. I love it.
3904	1	a	Epic game ever!! 
4498	1	a	I really enjoyed this game, I put a lot of hours into it, and was rewarded with an interesting story, lots to explore and heaps of combat.  What I like about it is that there's unlimited fights to have and things to explore, you can just wonder around the galaxy and fight endlessly. You can see the challenge rating of each star system, so you know what youâre in for before you go there, and if you want some relaxing fun you can just pop back to an easy system and kill everything with impunity. There are lots of spaceships to discover, and lots of weapons, that will suit your playing style and dexterity.  Combat is the central part of the game, you have a number of ships to field, and the AI is decent. Combat takes place on a 2D playing field, and you have a Godâs eye view of the whole map, so finding things to shoot is easy. Sometimes it gets tedious racing around the combat map to reach waypoints, or protect space ships with no self-preservation instinct.  However, by the time I was Â¾ of the way through the game it was getting tedious. I was only driven to complete the story, I could barely tolerate entering more combat because it was becoming repetitive. I did finish the game, and I did enjoy completing the story, but I canât see myself playing a second time.  Overall, I recommended this game as a good distraction. Exploding enemy ships and capturing or shooting their crew after they eject is satisfying for a gamer like me.
3652	1	a	1 OF THE BEST STRATEGY GAMES IVR
3360	1	a	You can invade small nations, no more needs to be said.
3933	1	a	The game that i can't stop playing. This game is the real boss, just like the other Total war series games, just with more places to bring hell to. Keep up the work, lads, and please, patch in some more diplomacy options.
1592	1	a	After coquering the entire known world through military and diplomatic means, converting myself to a Republic, controling everytrade route, and making every city happy under my rule...Horatio Herbert Kitchener, 34th Grand Protector of the Republic of Great Britain and her colonies...sat down and managed taxes for the rest of eternity.  9.9999/10  Would unite the world agianst the threat of China only to find that China is non existent again. 
3436	1	a	If youâve got the time and patience for it, thereâs literally hundreds of hours of gameplay to be found in the single-player portion of the game (specifically, World Domination). This is also a game that rewards various play styles and encourages you to try new things, all the while becoming more and more addictive with each hour that passes.
2989	0	a	Steam Sucks real bad avoid it if you can. The games you buy will constantly stop working. I wishh they would leave my game alone!!!!
251	0	a	I emailed Robot Entertainment to report a bug in the game because some creatures didn't die when they landed in lava. They simply said to buy the sequel because they didn't want to release any more bug fixes. Avoid like the plague.
3012	1	a	Great game.
1899	1	a	Would be the absolut best Total War Title for me, but you can not play the Maincampain in Multiplayer.... that is realy Bad. Great Singleplayer game ! if this Game would be remade By CA with an Multiplayer Campain , it would be the best Total War ever ! PS.: If the Game is not Buggt like Rom2. Anyway its always better to read reviews before buy any Total War Games. After i was buying Rom2 i was realy angry and i give the Tipp : Dont buy Rom2 untill CA are not fixing this completly Buggt game ! Better Buy Empire and spear Money and buy Rom2 later for less Money when it is fixt. ( if they dont fix it - dont buy it ! )
5041	1	a	Top-down gun-toting ship-building space-combat action! Simple and addictive.
4906	1	a	
4429	1	a	The game is kind of complicated of how to do things, but the battles are fun.
646	1	a	fun game...plays smoothly...not overly hard but some maps you do have to plan accordingly or you might let a few get through
2720	1	a	Amazing Campaign! Especially the 'Road to Independence'.
1464	1	a	Excellent game when used with DarthMod.
703	1	a	Fun and hilarious!! Worth every penny.
1867	1	a	This review is mainly concerning multiplayer. I have played Empire, Medieval 2, and Napoleon. I played the demo of Rome 2.  Three reasons why Empire is the best TW game that I have played: 1. I find the gunpowder warfare far more interesting strategically than the tactics of other TW games. 2. Compared to Napoleon, the nations in empire are more balanced. Personally I prefer the micro mechanics of Empire and how there is a clearer view of the battle. 3. In its current state, the game has relatively few flaws compared to when it was released.  *I have not played Shogun 2 so I am not able to compare Empire to it.
5300	1	a	Cool retro simulation that still has an 'open world' aspect on exploring. Very nice story, and the customizations are just nice. I hope SPAZ 2 will be as good as this one.
4589	1	a	This game reminds me a bit of Freelancer and Dark Star One, mixed with Armada from the Dreamcast. I enjoy this genre! If you enjoyed stage 1 of spore you'll love this.
4475	1	a	A great game y0. Battles go on all over the map, whilst you hear the faint sounds of cannons from the safety of your town. Its the little things that make it good. 10/10
2881	1	a	brill game amust play
4842	1	a	Very fun game, Another one of those cheap gems.
3833	1	a	Empire is still the best Total War ever published
4824	1	a	spaz is a good game and is good graphics.  i like the gameplay andthe ships the graphics are great. 
2297	1	a	great game
4123	0	a	Creative Assembly abandoned this game, no updates, no improvments nothing. Not even a workshop this game is dead as a door nail all the flaws are still going to be there no matter what unless you mod it. This game can be entertaining for while but bugs and terrible AI make this game annoying to play long term. I've played virtually every Total War since the very first one so I had high hopes for this one, but this game is just not very fun the difficutly settings are pointless raising difficulty doesn't make anything difficult it just makes everyone angry with you and more likely to declare war. Difficulty should reflect skill level which it doesn't in this game. The playablity is very limited once you've beat it a few times your bored with it only reason I've played this game recently is because I haven't played it in years and thought I'd play again simply because I own the game. DO NOT BUY! If you do wait for a sale because this game is not worth what they normally charge.
3804	0	a	.
208	1	a	Good game !! but once completed its boringg D: ! Recommended
5091	1	a	Top down space shooter with RPG elements... and ZOMBIES!!!  Lots of fun, can be hard as hell sometimes
438	1	a	Orcs Must Die is a critically acclaimed mix between acion adventure and tower defense. The game has some beautiful artwork, a vast amount of weapons and traps, and most importantly a band of lovable over the top characters. Although it is a large amount of fun to play I will say that not once on my playthrough did I think 'Wow I've never seen anything like this before' and that ends up being a fatal flaw of the game, however that does not make it a bad game. If you're in the mood for a lovable and charismatic adventure similar in spirit to a game like Borderlands then look no further. I would give Orcs Must Die a solid 7/10
3679	1	a	Empire Total War (ETW) takes place during the 1700s in the time of muskets, cannons, and ships of the high seas. I have played most of the previous Total War titles and expansions (Medieval 2 Total War, Rome Total War, Medieval Total War) and have liked them all. While each one has its own positives, ETW might be the most exciting.  The biggest difference in ETW is the wide scale use of firearms as the primary weapon. We got a taste of this with the Spanish in the Americas campaign in Medieval 2 Total War - Kingdoms Expansion Pack. But, ETW is all about getting your lines of infantry formed up and firing at the enemy. I found it very satisfying watching the volleys exchanged back and forth especially in large battles. The other game changer is the cannon. The cannon is now reasonably accurate and especially when fired with canister shot a deadly weapon. Battles will be settled by properly locating and applying your cannons.  If musket balls and cannon shot isn't enough, ETW offers many other upgrades and changes. One of the most desired upgrades is the addition of player controlled naval battles. You no longer have to auto resolve your naval battles. There may be better naval battle simulations out there, but I found ETW to be excellent. The ship graphics and animations during combat are top notch. The other games I have played that have naval combat (Patrician 3 and Port Royale 2) are primarily trade simulators.  ETW also has what I would call a scenario campaign (The Road to Independence). It allows you to play through the establishment of the American colonies and their independence from the British. The campaign follows a storyline and is more restrictive than the typical grand campaign, but I still found it enjoyable. Basically you complete specific mission objectives to continue forward. This scenario campaign is also a good tutorial before hammering it out in the grand campaign.  Another big change is the introduction of technology researching. Certain technologies are required to build certain buildings or upgrades. Technologies also include new forms of cannon ammunition, troop formations (square for infantry, wedge and diamond for cavalry), advancements in bayonets. Of course building upgrades will enable more and more powerful types of troops. You can also research social reforms which improve research capabilities and financial advancements. However, you also have to consider the impact of all these reforms. The populous may also seek revolution in the government. You can seek to embrace this change and lead the new government or fight it and either repress the revolt or be crushed by it.  ETW has also become global. You now have access to more than Europe and the Mediterranean. You can fight in the Americas and India. You can also setup trade depots along the coast of Brazil, Ivory Coast, Straits of Madagascar, and the East Indies to boost your trade income. You will find trade and diplomacy essential in the grand campaigns. Diplomacy will be key whether you need to increase your income with trade, swap technologies to get ahead, or develop alliances to support you against aggressive neighbors.  There are many other differences some more subtle than others that make ETW a slightly different experience.  *Non combat characters are back, but they generate themselves (instead of being recruited) based on the number of relevant buildings that you have.  *A new Gentleman character type has been introduced which can improve research capabilities or used to duel with spies or other gentlemen.  *Armies now have a zone of influence where they can intercept a passing army or let them pass instead of automatically halting the enemy.  *Armies with a general can now recruit additional units or reinforce damaged units while out in the field.  *A region now has towns other than the regional capital where buildings or resources can be exploited. However, these are now vulnerable to raids by your enemies. They can be repaired, but at a cost.  *Trade routes can also be raided instead of blockading to bring extra income.  *Generals/Admirals can be promoted in the field (at a cost)  *Armies that have been stationary for a turn can deploy defenses if attacked.  *Tax rates for Individual regions cannot be controlled (except by exempting the region from tax)  *Not all regions can have the same building options. This doesn't seem to be controllable like in Medieval 2 Total War.  I tried multiplayer for the first time in Total War. It is easy to get into a battle and there are still players to connect with. You can customize your army and there is online ranking system. Online battles are intense, but I prefer the single player campaigns.  Works with Windows 7. However, I have experienced game crashes which occurred during battles. I also had a campaign (with Prussians) freeze up which I had to abandon. I was able to complete another short campaign with Spain. 
2063	1	a	The game is great I just wish they had more mods for it and dlcs they should have sat down and added things to it
3080	1	a	Im going to be clear: This is NOT my favorite Total War game. Medievil 2 has that title. Anyway, so if you didn't buy this at release or close to release like me your in luck because at launch this game was a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing mess. Crashes left and right, units falling through the world, complete lag on the campagin map. Luckly it did get Ironed out and now its only an okay game. Diplomacy is completly useless. I offered the Ottoman Empire 100000 gold,Venice, and Canaster Shot for Egypt and the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s counterofferd for me Iceland for 1000 gold. What the acutal â¥â¥â¥â¥. Anyway, you will have fun with the battles unless you get your â¥â¥â¥ handed to you by a city-state like I did my second playthrough as Sweeden. The only reason I recommend this is because its Total War. And I have had some enjoyment of it. On a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being I'd rather go jack of an elephant than play this game and 10 being I love this game more than Skyrim, Porn, and Kate Upton combined, and 5 being buy it when its on sale, I'd give it a 7.
4912	1	a	The hull has been breached and the science is leaking out!
1961	0	a	u shouldnt try this game because u will get game crashed error.I investigated and most ppl having same problem even they paid for the game like me.So i wont pay for another TOTAL WAR game.
3846	1	a	what a great game 10/10
347	1	a	Quite fun game, but rather short. Beat the Normal difficult within 10 hours or so. Even then, the hardest difficulty proves very challenging and I can see beating it taking a lot longer. I'd give it a 85/100 or so, but if it's on sale, grab it for sure.
4772	1	a	The game plays a little like asteroids mixed with FTL, but words can't do it much justice. go play it.
1923	1	a	naval battle is really beautiful.. :')  and i can play as a pirate 10/10
1637	1	a	Probably my favorite Total War game
1947	1	a	I love the HUGE campaign map, now time to hang a GB flag over it all
1150	0	a	Disappointing again. It's no wonder this studio has crashed and burned.  As a longtime fan of the Disciples franchise who has been with the games since first release, I was excited for months after hearing about Renaissance. Like a lot of folks, I was legitimately upset by the poor quality of the finished game: Other than the beautiful graphics, nothing was right. The feel of the old games was gone along with the Mountain Clans and Undead Hordes factions, and gameplay was plagued by bugs and design flaws. I bought Resurrection in the hope that it might include patches and balancing to fix the vanilla game, and was let down again.  When I saw Reincarnation in the Steam store, I managed to get excited yet again, and bought it on impulse.  If you like Disciples, don't make that mistake.  Gameplay is smoother and the game runs a little better, yes, but the combat alone is ten times as frustrating. I can't count how many times I've loaded a save because just one or two low-level enemy units can chew through your entire force, in campaign mode. Also changed for the worse is the character advancement system, where previously units would upgrade into new, more powerful forms so long as you had the proper structure built in your capital; now, units must level up 3 times before transforming. Good luck surviving that long, and that's from a veteran player and a pretty decent TBS tactician.  Overall, even with improvements, Reincarnation is almost too exhaustingly irritating to play, especially in the long sessions for which you might normally enjoy a TBS.  4/10
4582	1	a	Cheap and â¥â¥â¥â¥ing awesome, made by just 2 guys but loads of fun
1483	1	a	Awesome game, very fun to make custom battles and a pretty fun campaign.
4718	1	a	35 hours says it all, you'll get addicted, beware there's a sequel coming! You'll want to beat that too!
2051	1	a	Until you get Darthmod dont expect 18th century battles, vanilla is more about just inf and cav since arty is to inaccurate to few pieces per squad and unit sizes of inf/cav are to small to hit them effecitvely as well as not nearly long enough range, that said this does makes for a more tactical MP experience.  however dont play the campain without Darthmod as Darthmod really gives a proper feel of 18th century warfare. (arty actually is necessary as in history it was) but still fun game none the less. Other wise its a Acrady infantry rush  grab it on sale and expect Diplomacy (the most broken in any Total war game) to be against you at all times and you can still have fun   also avoid Fort battles (they can be turned off all together with darth mod) although tacticly wise to use this game doesnt handle them well the AI bugs out and then it lags/crahses when the AI does its movement bug during a fort battle (doesnt matter defending or Attacking).  those intrested in Darthmod you will find it here with instructions within the dowload thread (read the list of threads you'll find the download one)   http://www.twcenter.net/forums/forumdisplay.php?1126-DarthMod-Empire 
4164	1	a	Empire, is a less laggy more diverse version of Napoleon. It runs well, alot of good maps to play on, and Plenty of factions, a handful more than napoleon has to offer. even features Elephant musketeers and elephant warriors, and the french, and even Indian tribes which are also fun to play as. I love this game. Buy it!
4715	1	a	Fantastic game.   Fun,   Resource management.   Did I mention it is fun?
2652	1	a	Conquered the world twice. :D  Loved it
640	1	a	As I Write This Very Review....And I hear The Gates being seiged by the foul Hourde. I look around at my Current Defences simi confident that they will hold againts the comming storm. Even though I have a storm of emotions rolling inside me I determine one thing............ORS MUST DIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1474	1	a	In my opinion, THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER! Worth every penny. I could go on and on about how awsome this game is, but to sum it up: You may pick from al selction of nations from the 1700s, from France to the Ottoman Emprie to Russia, and many more! Control world trade of the 1700s, and get all of those good resources, and make some MONEY! It is in the enlightenment, chose to help these new ideas grow and even become a republic yourself, or enforce the way of old! Turn your army into a invinceable war machine and conquer the whole campaign map, which streches from The Americas to Europe to India! GREAT GAME.
3432	1	a	Ever wanted to rewrite history? Ever wanted to create a dystopian world ruled by your country of choice? Ever wanted to completely crush Russia and wipe it off the map, destroying all remains of it's culture and people? I sure have... anyway, get this game, it's brilliant and entertaining as all heck.
2476	1	a	Definitely the best TW game out there with the greatest scope (North/Central America, Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, and India, plus trading posts around the rest of the world for naval battles), nicely varied armies (can be broadly categorized into Native American, European, Muslim, and Indian unit types, but with regional variations), decent naval combat, and competent ranged units that totally change the dynamic of the game's battles. Beware of stability issues, though, and I also miss all of the pre-made historical battles from RTW.
491	1	a	A Very addictive game from where I have played it. The controls are simple and the maps are different and fun. A must-have
4516	1	a	its quite good and even comes with the 'and bounty hunters' (i want to say expansion)
4161	1	a	  absloutely love this game
522	1	a	Orc and goblin oh my this is a fun tower defense game
3678	1	a	This is a great RTS game!
4734	1	a	its repetitive fun
1735	1	a	Beat it with my eyes closed before installing. Beat that!
4981	1	a	Classic is back with this one. If you love open space games like free-lancer etc. This one is for you!
3641	1	a	Love this game almost as much as Medevil Total War
3212	1	a	Empire is the best Total War game in my opinion. The ACW (American Civil War) mod adds a new and brilliant dimension to an already perfect global strategy war game, but this mod can be unstable. I wish the company would take the mod and turn it into a full game like Empire is, with accurate sounds and graphics of the era.
5015	1	a	Played it enough, better be good :-)
5179	1	a	Dumb amounts of fun.
1132	1	a	Very entertaining. You can lose several hours easily with this games.  As a mix of TPS, tower defense (but with traps) and strategy its a game where you have to think a bit which traps are best and where is the best place to use it.  If your not a tower defense player this game might get a bit boring after a few lvls.  But overall its a very nice game.
3057	1	a	it very entertaining
82	1	a	Awesome game!Unique gameplay and defense tactics, very nice upgrades. Lots of humor and you get to kill LOTS OF ORCS! :D I recommend this game, it's playable by all ages, no matter whether you are 12, 20, 40, 70... :D You will like it! It's lots of fun. I would give it a 10/10! :)
3822	1	a	Great game.  This was the first Grand Strategy game that I ever played and it was the game that introduced me to the genre of Grand Strategy games. Loved it when I started playing it and still love it. I will continue to return to this game to restore the Swedish Empire every time.
779	1	a	A cool tower defense with a twist, namely first person shooter. this makes placing traps and countering waves from different points tougher, but it also lets you counter the ones that slip through. Relatively cool graphics with lots of blood and ork bodyparts doesnt hurt either.
3253	1	a	This was the first game I ever bought from Steam, and it is still my favourite one. This stradegy game was perfect, from the Grand Campaign, to fighting individual battles, the fun never ends.
4367	1	a	One of the best Total War games. I have played 297 hours of this game, and it still is fun,
4376	1	a	It's been 2 years since I bought this game. Didn't play it until just a week ago, and I love it.
186	1	a	A very biased piece that criminally neglects to show the staggering number of grieving mother orcs and countless baby orcs now forced to grow up in a single parent household. White man strikes again...
3055	1	a	My favorite Total Warâ¢ game so far; the gameplay is amazing and there are some awesome mods made by the community to try out.
1158	0	a	Nothing really new in this version of the game, i was hoping to find new faction and/or units, in fact no. A new campaign is okay, but i was hoping to find a bit more for this price.  if you haven't played to Disciple 3, this version is okay but if you've played to the others, spend your money on another game, trust me
1960	0	a	A good turn-based strategy game. The things they got right are mostly how you manage your country's resources and diplomatic relations. In my experience with the game, I have encountered major problems in terms of computing casualties/damage, to the point where the only real way to win is to bayonet rush or use the 'autoresolve' feature. I recall witnessing on several occasions a foot soldier take a cannonball to the face and continue marching unscathed. This may have been fixed in newer versions, or it could have been a problem with my hardware.
4045	1	a	in multiplayer it says we have different versions but wwe have no extensdionsd or mods please help us
4841	1	a	I recently purchased this game and I must say, I love it!   Dont judge it by its initial appearance. I mostly play games like X3 Albion Prelude which are 3d games with 6 point rotation. The more I played this game the more addictive it became. The game play is really good and entertaining not to mention it has lots of things to blow up. It doesnt require a powerful pc to run it either. It has plenty of help features and It was able to pretty much answer all my questions as I have played so far. Might I mention it also has a good story line to it so far and did I mention it has good explosions lol. If you love space games you will want this one as well. I am glad I purchased it. The price I paid was almost unfair to the developers of this fine game. Cheers!
3102	1	a	This is Awesome!
900	1	a	An outstanding take on the tower defense genre. The game offers genuine choice as to how to complete levels, and the variety of levels as well as the decent challenge will keep you drawn in. It takes 8-10 hours to finish the campaign with good scores, and then there's Nightmare mode to contend with. Highly recommended.
4175	1	a	I totally recommend this game. This is my favourite strategy game. I mean, I used to think that a strategy game should be like age of empires or, I don't know, like civilization. But combination of both real time strategy and turn based strategy makes perfect sense imo. I mean, I can't think any other way to create a strategy game anymore. Anyways, here is my pros and cons:  Pros: -Unique units for every nation and some certain regions, -Unique naval units, well, not much but there are some. -Unique tech trees for every nation, -Unique buildings for every nation, -Technologies and Buildings work together, i mean, you have to research a certain tech to unlock a certain building, and you have to build a certain building in order to unlock a new tech to be researched -Trading system is nice, there are trading posts around the world that you can occupy and trade there, -Diplomatic relations, -Protectorates, -Minor nations, -Number of possible new nations, -Voices of units are very good. Best part of the game is this. Sometimes, I wake myself up by repeating the voices of units :D -Tactics in battles are really effective. If you count on your soldier number and go straight into enemy, you may get crushed. However, you can crush the enemy when you are outnumbered too. -You can interact with surrounding in a battle, -Naval Battles, -Amount of detail of land and naval units, -Historical accuracy. -18th century, I mean, isn't it perfect? Colonization and stuff. I used to play Age of Empires 3 before ETW. But AoE3 has nothing even near to ETW, in my opinion of course... -You can play online normal battles, naval battles, siege battles, siege defence battles etc.  Cons: -Lack of playable factions. You can't play as minor nations, i wish i could. I know you can, by changing stuff in the game folder, but i don't want that. -AI gets really stupid and stubborn and jerk and selfish in diplomacy sometimes, but it is good in the battles -Main storyline is short -Your pc will get roasted if it is not really good. Or, at lower settings you will wish to get blind and never see something like that again. -Religions, as an atheist, I don't like to convert people into christianism or islam or any of the other religions, but when you are playing the game you have to. Or the people will go rage mode and starts riots and burns down places or worse, they rebel and try to take away your regions etc. -A lot of cool unique units are in the DLCs. But I don't judge, it's 2016 and every game developer does this. Bright side is the DLCs are not that expensive, i think that's something... -Grand Campaign mode is not infinite. I would be great if it was, but then it would make no sense. I mean, how could using muskets and bayonets and horses make any sense at the year 2372?  Anyways these were my pros and cons. Like said in the beginning, I totally recommend this game. If you haven't played any of the Total War games, you cannot assume that you love strategy games, because you have never played a real one. The only strategy game i have ever played that is closest to this consept was Rise of Nations. But it wasn't quite enough. I think Total War games are the best strategy games so far. Empire TW was my first total war game and I think this is the the best Total War game, imo. I couldn't play newer Total War games though. Neither my economic currency nor my pc would let me do it. However, as far as I saw from Medieval TW, Rome TW, Medieval 2 TW and obviously Empire TW, Creative Assembly knows how to create a perfect strategy game and needs to be appreciated.   Anyways, let me tell you how i felt when I first enter the game: I always wanted to try a TW game, because a lot of people recommended it to me. One day I saw this game on Steam and I thought, 'Hmm.. A Total War game. Let's see...' and I purchased this game. Then I entered the game. It seemed cool. Then I started the main story, Road to the American Independance. For the first 1-1.5 hours, I was like 'Dafuq has happened', 'Dafuq was that', 'Dafuq is this', 'Dafuq do I do?'. Yeah I really was like that. But then I started to understand what is game all about.For the following 2-3 hours I was like 'Omg omg omg', 'â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game is awesome!', ' I will play this game until the death takes us apart!'. After I finished the main story, I started a Grand Campaign as Ottoman Empire [Because I am a 'Turkish Patriot' (no i'm not, just kidding, but i love my nation and our history)] And it was so much different than American campaign. Then i see the variety in this game and I was like: ' OMG, i had no idea about this game, this game is much more awesome than i thought'. Then I kept playing this game, and the game kept getting even better. I still play this game without getting bored.    So yeah, these were my opinions. I hope I did help you. Thank you for reading. Have a nice game!
3558	1	a	Good wholesome game great tactics very well made great brain game all the cool stuff the previewest ones had endless fun.
5232	1	a	Very fun with a gameplay experience that lasts a long time for the price
2069	1	a	Step 1: Buy the game Step 2: Play before experiencing Darthmod Step 3: Install Darthmod for Empire Step 4: Realize how awful Vanilla version is Step 5: Love Darthmod for Empire Step 6: Recommend game for the sole purpose of Darthmod
516	1	a	Orcs Must Die! is a very nice take on the tower defense genre. Seeing as I only played through the Single Player portion of the game and on Warmage difficulty my review will be based on that.  The game starts out with a short cinematic of an old archmage who meets his untimely demise at the hand of some stairs. As he falls Orcs are about to storm the portals into our world with one last obstacle in their way, the archmage his terribly unskilled apprentice, you.  Throughout the campaign the game slowly expands your arsenal of weapons and traps that you can use to slaughter the oncoming horde as they attempt to break through. At no point are you overwhelmed with choice or are you left with few options on how to handle a given situation.  While some strategies are more effective in certain situations you are always free to take the hard path. The difficulty level is not too high in this game and greatly depends on your preffered play style. Once I developed a certain preffered trap combo I found myself using it over and over with great effect until certain maps came along where the combo was entirely useless forcing me to adapt my playstyle.  The only shortcoming in this game is that while the difficulty is okayish in most levels there are certain spikes that can come as a complety suprise and force you to figure out some mechanics without being informed about them so this might be frustrating for some players who prefer to casualy walk through a game.  The only noticeable bugs I encountered were with flying enemies going straight through walls in some stages and in another some enemies managed to get stuck at the bottom of an acid swamp without dying. Overal these encounters were few and once you were aware of the possibility of them occuring not all that problematic.  Overal score of 8/10, Would totally recommend this to fans of the genre.
501	1	a	Hands down the most fun I've ever had playing a tower defense game. Got this on sale for $0.99 and it is definitely worth every penny!
1072	1	a	extra fun with controller
2237	0	a	My least favorite Total War. I only say don't get it because you should get another Total War game instead: Medieval II, Shogun 2, or Rome II. If you like strategy games at all, you simply must play one of those because they are all great single player games with amazing depth.
3379	1	a	It is very good you are looking for a good total war here it is this game is worth $20
1020	1	a	Very fun mix of combat and tower defence, very funny humor, and challenging. Great game aside from not having multiplayer (the 2nd one will).
2868	1	a	This game has lot of gameplay even without mods that can add even 1000 hours more gameplay and fun. Definetly recommended for simple gameplay mechanics and its newbie friendly game.
2265	0	a	While I never experienced this game in it's initial release state I find it hard to believe it could of been much worse than it is now. To start, the vanilla game is simply bland as oatmeal, so mods are a necessity to even enjoy it. The campaign map is horribly, horribly optimized. On high settings with thousands of highly detailed troops on the battlefield the game runs flawlessly, but the campaign map with mostly flat low resolution terrain and a few low-poly models? Barely chugs along at 10 FPS with ungodly amounts of stutter. Pathetic. This combined with the poorly redesigned UI makes doing anything on the campaign map a chore.  The open land battles are this game's only strong point. The engine is capable of handling tens of thousands of troops at once (although you'll never see more than a couple thousand without mods), and it can be quite a spectacle to watch and even somewhat fun to command. Still, sadly CA once again decided that instead of putting effort into making the AI more intelligent on harder difficulties, they went with giving the AI absurd arbitrary melee bonuses on hard and very hard difficulties.  Siege battles however are even more broken than previous titles despite being considerably simplified. Instead of directly defending a walled city you now attack/defend the starforts that surround them (if they've been built). Siege equipment no longer exists, as infantry can simply climb the walls using ropes and cannons can simply destroy the walls from a safe distance. Despite these features the AI can still frequently can get stuck running their troops around just outside the walls getting slaughtered by musket and cannon fire, and troops on the wall can get stuck due to â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ pathfinding. Worst of all though is a critical bug that can happen when a section of wall is destroyed, that causes the game to slow down massively for no apparent reason.  The big new feature of course in Empire was being able to fight naval battles. Unfortunately, despite their cinematic appearence, they are usually more of a hassle to fight than they're worth. This is mostly due to the ship AI of course, that forces you to manually control every ship for any of them to be effective.
4915	1	a	A good open-ended space RPG
445	1	a	Great twist on tower defense! Funny too!
3796	1	a	Me play. Me like.
2095	1	a	Ruined My Life. Over 9000/10.
777	1	a	Remember, you are the hero, but they see you as the final boss of a dungeon crawl. Its you, and your traps. Against hundreds or orcs. Now, if it was thousands, Then maybe, just maybe, it would be a fair fight.
1486	1	a	Played as Sweden, Invaded Russia in the winter, kicked the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of poland, made an alliance with the ottomans, beat the ever living â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of Denmark, killed some unarmed farmers with grenadiers, and controlled all of eastern europe and most of western europe, army got killed by farmers with pitchforks. 420/69 would Sweden again.
1552	1	a	The closest you can come to world domination.
4901	1	a	After paying two dollars, I really didnât expect much, but this game certainly delivered.  I could tell right away a lot of love and care went into making this. What also made this game great was the amount of customization you could put into your ships, from better guns to shield boosters, you could pimp your little cruiser into a true killing machine.   Pros:   Huge amount of customization  Lots of gameplay  no glitches (that I encountered at least)  Vast number of ships to unlock  Very rewarding loot    Cons:   VERY, VERY GRINDY  Lots of repreat quests  game is a little too long   
3406	1	a	I'm a huge fan of 4X games and this one does not dissapoint. It's not my favorite Total War game, but it delivers where it should. If you're a fan of Total War or other 4X games you deserve it to yourself to check it out.
3027	1	a	It's Alright. That's almost all i can say about Empire Total War. Not a Rome 2 level trash-fest but, at the same time, it aint' no Rome: Total War. Reasons? The Good: -Damn fine historical accuracy MOSTLY. -battles controls feel simpler, more realistic. -SEA BATTLES. Wow. Nuff' said. -Campaign is solid and won't muck around with boring AI and long, drawn out turntimes like in other Total War installments.  The Bad and the Ugly: -Graphics suffer from the same hazy, crayola-looking dreariness that Napoleon after it suffered with. -Again, why are the unit funds in custom battles restricted to a ten year old's pocket money? -AI is borderline slow. And i mean it this time. I get that this game came out years ago and that there is areason why it sold for less than a fiver on Steam, but come on guys, if Rome:Total War ihas better AI than a game made years after it, something's wrong. -Units feel repetitive, the images for some units are literally just repasted with different colours. -AGAIN, Why is the unit fund so low? whyyyy??? If it's on sale, meh, give it a go. Maybe you'll love it. 6/10    'It's like playing with warm dough. Slow, messy, but at least it's not crap.'
3776	0	a	Worst total war game EVER!
4073	1	a	Totaly hooked on this game, hours of fun.
4234	1	a	I really like it and surprisingly i am very good at it
757	1	a	Traps, weapons, minions, towers, and (of course) orcs abound in this third-person tower defence game. The dialogue is surprisingly funny and adds a bit of zest to the already-fun task of creating the world's least orc-friendly castle hallways.  Tip: Use a row of wall blades and tar pits (with some barricades, if necessary) to create a single-file orc slaugherhouse. It's as much fun to build as it is to watch in action.
1393	1	a	Best game! It was a challenge. historic, and an all around fun game to play. Anyone liking strategy and aggressive AI will like this.
3010	1	a	this is so fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
749	1	a	This game runs face-first into the same problem that Sanctum did - that success relies on one correct strategy from the beginning. Not only that, but you get to upgrade your traps, and if you mess that up by putting them in the wrong areas, there's no refunds - you actually have to start a new profile.  The graphics, music, sound and concept all receive an A, but the number of flawed tower defense games on this planet are as innumerable as the stars.
4383	1	a	Completed my first campaign it only took 230 hours! And still having a blast.
4391	1	a	Absolutely the most awesome wargame and strategy game ever! Totally brilliant!!!
1015	1	a	Approved!
2208	0	a	I like this game, but I would not recommend it.  The game for the most part takes place during the mid 1700s to early 1800s, when muskets were weapon of choice for armies, when the golden age of sail was reaching its peak, and European nations had vast colonial empires that stretched across the globe. You control a major nation during this time and it's your job to lead it to glory, generally by crushing anyone who tries to pick a fight with you. The world is yours to conquer, and it is a very large world indeed.  And yet despite how awesome that sounds, this is not a good game. For a tactics game, the AI strategy for most games kind of sucks. Rather than take advantage of terrain like they did in previous Total War games, the AI will almost always charge you head on. And on my computer whenever there was a large battles the game would tend to chug like anrexic train going uphill. If you have a modern gaming rig, you *might* not have the same trouble I did but even then I wouldn't bet on it.  And the combat map designs are kind of lazy. It doesn't matter what part of the globe you're fighting on, because chances are you'll be fighting on the same square of 1700th century farm land with MAYBE a palette swap of the ground textures. This is real shame because in previous Total War games they had meticulous detailed combat maps.  However the one saving grace of this game is its naval combat. The ships in this game are gorgeous, with meticulous detail put into every ship model. And there are a lot of ships, from bomb ketches, to the first rates, and even steam ships later in the game. Naval combat revolves primariy around using the wind to your advantage and either destroying enemy ships with regular cannon balls or crippling so you can board and capture them. Here seems to be where all the brains for the AI went, because it will actually use tactics.   However even the naval combat will not be for everyone. For one thing it requires and intense ammount of micro managing. Every single ship will need to be repositioned at some point. And in order to use some the abilities that will turn the tide, you need to take control of each ship one at a time to activate them. Personally I liked the challenge, but I've heard from others that they found it to be a pain in the â¥â¥â¥.  So for me personally, I have a love hate relationship with this game (in that I hate that I love it) but I would recommend virtually any other Total War game over this one.
1563	1	a	Go to war like a sir.
4	1	a	Orc Must Die is typically one of those indie games that must be in the library of those gamers who a) like the RPG genre b) are fond of indie games. This game is not just an RPG but also a strategy one.  It is a tower defense game, basically, but as opposed to the usual top-down approach this game uses a third person perspective. It is an interesting choice but certainly makes the game convenient to play. The rest is the usual stuff: the orc waves are getting more and more difficult and the player unlocks more types of traps. Oh, and of course, on later levels we have to look out for more areas as the enemies can approach our base from several directions.  If you are bothered by the fact that one single orc reached your base and because of that you lost a couple of points you are free to replay all previous levels for better results. This replayability and the dozens of available levels make sure OMD is a long-lasting experience. At the time of writing this review the game has a 75% discount and its GOTY edition certainly is a catch for just 2 euros.
4714	1	a	Simple and Addictive. A great buy.
1139	1	a	Great mix of action and tower defense! Music is awesome and it's just plain hilarious!
3227	1	a	one hell of a fully comprehensive game
45	1	a	FPS meets Defend-Your-Castle-style play. On top of fun and demanding gameplay, this game also has a fantastic soundtrack and a great sense of humor.
679	1	a	I highly reccomend if you're the sort that loves to 'turtle' playing RTS. The entire game is about making crunch points and traps so devious I giggled like a four-year-old mad genius. The dialogue is witty and goofy in a perfectly comic way, and I just love forcing them into narrow pathways and grimacing as bits of Orcs go flying everywhere.
1667	1	a	I can say without a doubt that this is a good game. While remaining unbiased, I will include that it does have bugs and there are areas where features could have and should have been included. I give the vanilla game 6/10 and the Darthmod version w/ the AUM mod an easy 8/10. If you loved Command and Conquer then this one is a must own.
2187	0	a	THIS IS THE BEST GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED! GET IT NOW
471	1	a	I got a recommendation for this game, I RECOMMEND that you just forget it exists because it's the worst pile of doo doo butter that has ever stained itself upon the steam library. Every time I think of this game I want to vomit until I die. Final Score: 8/10
3618	0	a	Very Clunky AI and gameplay. Have previous titles from Total War and can say this is a downgrade from previous titles.
1385	1	a	Played a little - liked it. Played a little more - still liked it. Played even more with mods - still like it.
4528	1	a	Old school gaming mechanics and genres updated and taken to new heights.   I'd have written this off as a cheap clone of numerous games if I were judging it based on a few screenshots. The truth is it's deep, addictive, massive and is comprehensively supported by both dev and community.  A polished title in every respect.
2311	1	a	The best Total War game, to me. Rome: Total War in it's original was on the same level when it was newly released. Fewer bugs on Empire: Total War. Do not buy this if you are into multiplay. Look for mods on the net as well, will give more playtime for you.
4201	1	a	Having played Napoleon Total War first, I could accept that the game wouldn't be as good as Napoleon. However, some of the features in Empire are much more interesting, such as the factions, campaign map, and battle maps but I believe that the mechanics of Naploeon Total War, as well as the AI and interesting time period clearly set a divide between the two games. Personally, I would say Empire Total War is a good game with lots of interesting and great features, however, if you want to go for a game with a better battle AI and also a more interesting time period (in my oppinion), I'd recommend this game to play but I'd recommend Napoleon Total War over Empire Total War.
2627	1	a	I only have Rome Total War 1 and this. They are both great games, but Empire is clearly the best for me. I love the theme of line infantry and the sight of the cannons rolling back with smoke coming from their barrels. I also love the naval battles, however these can become an anoyance, for example, trying to transport mutiple trade ships to Africa, but the french just keep sending fleets at you. Great game overall, however the factions all seem to alike. I also love the option to have a revolution, change to a republic or monarchy and get a new flag!   9/10; an easy score for a great game
2170	0	a	used to love the game until I got windows 10 now it wont play and cant find a fix
2834	1	a	Many different nations to play as in different continents which could last you long to play this game. Escpecially if you have all the DLC's ;3.
3530	1	a	This game has its glitches but in my opinion it is one of my favorite alltime games 
1118	1	a	Fun new take on TD games.
4762	1	a	It's ok
2401	1	a	addictive game!
1613	1	a	Do you like horses?  Do you like Muskets that take forever to reload?  Do you like cutting down an entire unit of infantry with a cannon ball?  Do you like burning down London for what they've done to Earth in the past?  Do you like what-if scenarios?  Do you like making friends with countries, only to stab them in the back 2 in-game years later?  If you answered yes to any of these questions... YOU'RE A SICK F***!  But no worries, because we have just the game for you. it's called Empire: Total War.  Here, you can change the course of history, in various ways, like saving the Natives from the Europeans, or turning the Prussia into a Super-Power. Reasearch technology, build your army, and dominate the world.  But most of all, you can march into Russia, during the winter time. SUCK IT NAPOLEON AND HITLER!  Total control is in your hands... if you're smart, if you're not, you're gonna get steam-rolled, srry... Not srry.  17\14 -LANESLASH
4079	0	a	This game has too many bugs, Creative Assembly at least improve Unit Collision in Battle.
817	1	a	Mindless fun. Buy it on sale.
3351	1	a	I really like it, ESPECIALLY the naval combat. It is amasing. I reccomend it.
4042	1	a	Almost naturally, developers Creative Assembly followed hard on the heels of Medieval 2 (and its 'Kingdoms' expansion pack) with another instalment of the Total War series. Empire is both a real time and turn based strategy game.   Naval combat, for the first time, is part of carving out an empire throughout Europe. Players must learn how best to maneouvre sailings ships, depending on wind direction, and direct devastating broadsides on enemy ships with deadly precision. Land battles are still a major feature - although much has changed since the Middle Ages: players must learn about volley-fire and capturing key buildings in an age of gunpowder. Generals are now able to recruit in the field, while it's possible for soldiers to desert, even suffer from climate attrition.  Empire has made some changes to characters: Diplomats have gone, although diplomacy with other nations is still much part of the gameplay and forms now part of the campaign map interface. Rakes are a combination of both spy and assassin roles. And during this period of enlightenment, 'Gentlemen' can infiltrate settlements, aid in scientific research, commit acts of subterfuge, and challenge rivals to duels!   A steady income is one vital factor to Total War; overseas Trade plays a big part in Empire. Recruit merchant ships and send them to distant trade posts before your rivals lay claim to the spoils. The campaign map itself is more richly detailed than before, being split into three theatres: New World, Europe, and India. As head of your chosen nation, you must decide over which of these you'd like to expand your empire and gain the fruits of conquered lands.   One additional side to Empire is the seperate campaign 'Road to Independence'. This tells the fascinating story of how England's New World colonies grew, rose to prominence during the Seven Years War, then finally all thirteen colonies declared independence thus war upon their former motherland. Such a feature emphasized key dramtic events during the 18th century period. There was a certain thrill establishing the United States as a new power in the world!   On a more negative note, however, Empire did stumble on a few issues. The Historical Battles section is always something that could have been exploited to the full within the Total War series. While it's nice having several scenarios, I felt (as with previous titles) the developers could have worked on at least a dozen key battles. The 18th century was crammed with numerous engagements, for example Blenheim was a decisive battle between Louis IV's France and Great Britain and her allies, or the Battle of Poltava during the Northern War between Russia and Sweden. Sadly, these and other such possibilities missed out star status in this section. But, since Empire requires a Steam connection, it's not too late for this to be remedied via automatic or even seperate purchase updates. It would be good of Creative Assembly to revisit and improve upon Empire in this way.  I didn't think much to the Warpath Campaign expansion. In my opinion, it has to be the weakest out of all the Total War series. For one thing, something similar yet far more exciting and in-depth had already been done in Medieval: Kingdoms (Americas). But also - and no offence meant to the American native contingent - the factions lacked that extra something to grab my attention. Again, we return to the possibilities prevalent of the 18th century: another sweeping campaign similar to the scope and calibre of 'Road to Independence' would have been a far better option. The natives could have played a more pivotal role during a 'Seven Years War' expansion, for example, with more factions and specialized units to play around with. Yet here, 'Warpath' just seemed a little bit boring, a wasted opportunity.  One ground-breaking feature introduced by Empire is the model animation. During melee, I was transfixed by soldiers displaying a variety of moves: thrusts, parries, dodges, rolls, slashes, rifle butts....a deadly ballet all combined into truly authentic battle scenes. It's something I can watch time and again. Hand-to-hand fighting moves were touched upon in Medieval 2 yet never fully developed into what Empire has to offer; elaborate combat animation has now become an integral mainstay for the Total War series battles.   During battles, it's possible for a troop unit to get stuck. It could be down to uneven ground, or a troublesome soldier got caught on a nearby tree, etc - yet it's so annoying when such a tiny discrepancy interferes with your orders to fire-at-will on enemy within range. Whilst your line troops are stood idly by, said enemy has no trouble peppering them with musket fire as if they were no more than wooden dummies. Another frustration happened to me during an 'end turn'. This reveals AI moves....and upon reaching the Marathas Confederation it just froze! I tried reloading again and again, even disabled 'show AI moves' option, yet the same thing occurred.   And so Empire still needs some work: bugs ironing out, campaign updates, improvements upon what could have been - hopefully what might yet be - a near perfect addition to the Total War series. I'm writing this five years after the game itself was released, now Rome II is in the spotlight - perhaps, if that game is constantly being updated and DLC purchase content can be added, perhaps Empire will receive similar overhaul treatment. Nevertheless, as it stands, Empire Total War has some fantastic moments and the occasional flair of gameplay genius: ensuring hours of battles, campaign planning, and artful diplomacy!
3769	1	a	Truly enjoyed this game! Probably the greatest Total War game of the series.. Trust me that you will love the game if you're deciding to buy it. At least in this game you kind of have option how to rule your country and plan what you might do. Honestly, Total War do make great games but this one takes the cake!  A+++++++
1720	1	a	very good game, i would sincerely recommend this! some lag but easily fixed, Campaign map is awesome! AI is good, 9/10 stars!
4928	1	a	Like Asteroids but better, and cheap to boot!
2729	1	a	Firstly, I have been a long time fan of the Total War series and have played since Rome II and every subsequent title since. I can say that this expansion is easily within my top three favorite TW games. This game has a few typical flaws found in earlier TW games, but overall is a solid experience. I have a few personal preferences that some might find annoying, I shall still list these in the Pro's column as it's my review and I'll do what I want.    Pro    1) Diverse faction choives: TONS of factions to choose from, each with its own unique advantages/disadvantages. For example, the mryiad includes; the Ottoman Empire, Great Britain, The Iroquis Confederacy, and The Maratha Confederacy (to name a few). Unlike many TW games, the units are diverse and not merely rewraps of the same one unit.   2) Awesome Economy!: At first I struggled to find a decent balance between my army maint. and income level when I first started out. However unlike most TW games, where the economic balance can seem daunting to beginners, I found this title to be pleasently forgiving. For veteran players, be prepared to make a TON of money, especially through trading. I can not express how paramount trading in this TW title. One note that many will find annoying, to upgrade your farms, mines, etc. you must click on each indv resource that is located around the map. For example, in Shogun 2 your farms are located winthin your city, along with any extra resources, in Empire only your military/admin. building is and you are forced to keep track of literally dozens of different resources. I like this personally, simply because it is cool to see your empire become more prosperous.   3) Tons of land: Like tons, three different theatres; India, Europe and America. This means a lot of gameplay and conquering, oh the fun you'll have.     Cons   1: Stupid AI: The AI, like in many earlier releases, is not the most adpet at military combat. While sometimes I have been throughly suprised, I have never truly been threatened as I have in similiar titles playing on the hardest difficuly. Sadly, some of your major powers, like the Maratha Confederacy over time lose the ability to fight advanced troops like the Europeans.   2: Lag/Crash: I have yet to play a game through without experiencing three crashes. Some games have taken me 50+ hours and to be consistently crashing gets old fast. I will say it is nothing to pre-patched Rome II.   Consensus: If you are even a remote TW fan, then buy this game. You will have loads of fun and many hours to frolic across the world.
1505	1	a	Jean Kirstein approves of this game.
5237	1	a	This game is rediculously fun and comical. It has so much to offer and is really well thought out. The game can also be modified to how fast you want to complete it, and also leaves room for almost endless customization of your ships. They also plan to update with future improvments like more ships, modules, missions, and storyline. If you asked me about this, I'd tell you to get it in a heartbeat.
1313	1	a	I'm a big fan of all the Total War games! No other grand strategy war games takes on whole eras of combat with such a combination of respect and fetishism for the rules and wisdom of battle, and no series treats history like such a serious playground of possibilities. If you have the time and the dedication, all the Total War games will shower you with gaming glory and riches, Empire is no exception.  And as a personal bonus for me, this game mentions my ancestors (which are very rarely mentioned in video games), the Kalmyks!  http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=590501874   http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=590458520   http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=723801740 
4786	1	a	Much fun! Basically kind of an Asteroids RPG, but with more action! Good game!
2128	1	a	-Becomes British -First campaign -Builds army -Recruits navy -Goes to areas around Nassau -Declares war on Spain -Takes over Spanish terretories in the colonies -XD -Spain takes them back -FFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUU -Start advancing troops to take over America -Successful -Forgot two reigons -Sighns peace treaty -Asks for military access -Takes over one of the two reigons -Sighn peace again (Stupid americans XD) -At this point im dieing of laughter -Destroy nation  10/10 Would decive the americans like the French again.
2282	0	a	Just get fall of the samurai 
2963	1	a	One of the best ever created game of all times!!!
4551	1	a	Very very fun game with tons of ships to chose from for many play styles .  (my favorite being a medium sized ship with speed and a cloak with a turret mount turret preferably the battle station)
104	1	a	For eveyone who likes WC3 TD, this game is a must have! Awesome settings and you can now run around with your own charachter. I had a lot of fun! Tip: if you notice you did the wrong placement of traps within the first few rounds, just recreate the game and try a difference tactic.
5181	1	a	I bought Space, Pirates, and Zombies (SPAZ) on sale for $2. I liked it so much I bought 4 more copies to give to family and friends so the developer would get the full $10 asking price out of me. Easily the best $10 I've spent on steam to date.
413	1	a	8/10  A great tower defence game, with the addition of an FPS side it makes for a great game.  Making traps for orcs is great, the difficulty isnt overly hard, theres a wide range of weapons, levels and traps to keep the game interesting.  Worth a pickup.
2897	1	a	8/10 would STEAMroll Europe again. The game is well-balanced, has good real-time battlefield gameplay, an immersive Grand Campaign, decent ai, and an variety of units and factions to choose from. If you like Total War games, this is a steal.
380	1	a	awesome fun cant wait for multiplayer on orcs must die 2
1618	1	a	If you like seeing thousands of men in one army completly killing with another army of thousands of men, this is your game. A great turn based strategy along with real time playing. This game sparked my interest in the Total War series, and is and was a great starter for the series
1478	1	a	You see, I bought the elite pack which contains the DLC and original game, although it was a bit pricey...  Anyways, back to the game. Empire is quite different from the other games in the series because it allows Naval Battles! On this unique experience, you control your army on the 7 seas, versing A.I. or real people online or locally. It can get quite intense, as your ships may flee if damaged, but there are also contreversol wins!  The game also allows you to (as I mentioned earlier) to play online with friends, or random people. The problem with online matches though, is that if your internet is bad, you must drop from the game. This can lead to frustraion from the opposing player. You can also do quick Naval or Land matches (Although, finding a game in the quick section is difficult.) You can team up and join an alliance in online matches too! They are quite intense! I prefer playing with friends, 'cause im so good at the game and I beat them :3.  The Total War Series has never been known for graphics, but I have to say this game suprises me. My favourite part is seeing my men run into my enemy and watch the battle. You can see them have little battles with eachother! It looks quite realistic, as after the batttle you can see all the dead men that have fought.  Overall this game is meant for RTS players who enjoy a good online battle. This game is simple to manuver and comprehend. This is my favourite out of the Total War series (personally.) Overall, It definately fed my hunger for a good bloodbath and RTS game. I give it a 8.5/10!
4077	1	a	Empire Total War I love the game to bits the line battles are amazing and bring much stragety into the battles. Downside is the campaign map I dont know why but it just bugs me for some reason. Overall I love total war games and nothing going to change it.
4466	1	a	Beautiful game! If you are one of those guys that hate easy strategy games, and want something that relies more on your capacity of situation analysis, like war strategies, economic strategies, and psychological pressure, this game is perfect for you. You have different kinds of troops, like light infantry, heavy infantry, cavalry, artillery, and your settlers. And each one counters the other. So it's all about team work and planned strategies. You can either create a strong economy, or make a fast attack. Of course it's not as simple as that. That's why this game is so awesome! Each game is full of posibilities.
4154	1	a	Empire Total war is one of Total War's best games where you play a faction of the 1700's, though the game dosn't encompass the whole globe and the late game gets kinda stale, each faction you play is a whole differant experience. Aswell the mini campaigns are very very fun and entertaining. Truely one of total war finer moments and should be a game consider for a reboot. I personally give empire total war a 4.7/5
4486	1	a	Delivers that old-school skill based freeflying space shooter gameplay (say that three times fast) just like the developers wanted and manages to combine it with fast paced naval style tactics in a 2 dimensonal battlefield to keep things interesting. On top of that they shift gears at the end game and throw in a light turn based strategy system on top of it.   Resource mangement can be a grind and a drag at times as your progress comes to an almost literal deadstop because your enemies are simply way too strong for you to even make a dent in their armor. Time has to be spent collecting resources to build ships while buttering up the factions for each system you visit for the tech upgrades they have unless you want to blow their stations to pieces so you can just take it instead, either way you're going to have to stop and smell the roses a few times, more than a few if you lose a lot of ships.  The plot is a throwback to the classic days as well, no 'deep' triple A slop here, just a decent story to keep the action going with a predictable unfolding if you pay any attention at all and a great ending to lead into the second game which I am now highly anticipating. Overall an excellent title for anyone who likes classic action, tactics and maybe a small sense of conquest and conquering at the same time.
1033	1	a	Fun, but has DLC...so I'd give it 6/10
1985	0	a	This is my least favorite total war game, I just could not really get into it like the other total war games.   It showed me that a ranged combat focused total war game is a bad total war game. Land battle is just boring imho, and you have to micromanage all the time to avoid friendly fire. There are tons of unit in this game, but pretty much all of them are men with muskets in different colors. Unit movement is glitchy (horses sometimes slide on the ground without moving their bodies lol), AI is glitchy (like in most total war games, but happens more often, like AI melee infantry just stand and let you get free shots at them).   I really dont like how they nerfed cavalry in this game, they will drop like flies if getting in the range of line infantry, they are even not good at chasing down routing enemy now because they would get stuck in a 10 seconds long dueling animation with a roundting militia like WTF. Now most battle pretty much plays like getting your line infantry forming up formation, and then just watch them shot at enemy until rout, or maybe charge enemy if you got number advantage / enemy better at range / have more cannons etc. This kind of battle certainly does not appeal to me who like the melee combat in the other total war games.  Anyway, I will sum up my opinion:   &gt;Land battle is god awful, repetitive slow and boring  &gt;The newly introduced Sea battle is good but require a lot of micro-management  &gt;New campaign features like technology are welcomed addition.  &gt;Major nerfed generals and cavalry. Generals do not give speech anymore, they are so generic. Melee Cavalry are so underwhelming, because their small number, they can be killed easily by pretty much everyone including artillery and infantry with bayonet and box formation. Dragoons/ ranged cavalry are pretty good though.  &gt;AI is very predictable, but you can say the same for the other total war games too.  &gt;Hands down the Worst soundtrack in total war games ever, seriously it is so bad almost make my ears bleed. especially the 'Native American' soundtrack (and they even recycled the old M2TW Native American soundtrack in empire, so lazy), along with their jaw-dropping OP land armies makes the Native American my worst nightmare in empire total war. Even though by the same composer, the sound track is much improved in rome 2, although still miles away from the legendary Jeff Van Dyck's work.  After investing more than 100 hours in Empire, I still think I liked Rome 2 better than this game. As I recall Empire also had a really glitchy launch, and it is the start of the DLC policy in total war series, I really dont understand how a lot more people hate rome 2 than empire.  I would not recommend this game unless you really like the time period, there are much better total war games out there, and my current Top 1 is still Medieval 2 Total War
931	1	a	Very fun! Very cheap!
3958	1	a	Wow, this is some good stuff.
1668	1	a	Great addition to the Total War archive. Had lots of fun leading the Revolutionary War. Most factions howerver are limited to only ranged units, and do not focus on hand to hand combat. 8/10
5005	1	a	yes..good game! old school with upto date grapthics. its needs more weopons tho and the ability to paint your ships so you could wreck face with style
4088	1	a	Just 4 hours of this game made me love this. i played as prussia because they started with the least regions so i wanted to build it up and it would be more easy to defend. OH I WAS WRONG. i have to deal with austria , britain , united states , saxony so i allied with poland. i gave austria to poland because austria is a pain to control and it would stop austria from entering my lands without dealing with my ally poland. now i have to deal with united states and bravia to the left of berlin. 0_0
3654	1	a	This is an awsome game a few bugs but less bugs than napoleon
1126	1	a	I am having a blast. planning and shooting required, fun granted
847	1	a	Crazy fun action, with fun weapons, and a nice strategy element from the trap placement aspect. Also, a decent story that mostly takes a backseat to the action, but is enough to be interesting.
37	1	a	Very fun tower defence game
3166	1	a	Empire total war delivers a punch to the gaming industry and in the strategy genre in general. Set in 1705 you start as a glorious nation which has to conquer some cities and islands(ex Bahamas) to win. The game has great graphics and the naval battles are my favorite due to the impressive unit design. Land battles and sieges are even greater and YES, this game is a must buy option for anyone who loves the strategy genre
64	1	a	Orcs Must Die! is a nice twist on the traditional tower defence genre. Instead of building towers to defeat creeps (orcs), you set traps along their path. The game is played in third person view, so you can also kill orcs with your own spells and weapons too (similarly to Sanctum). OMD is exactly what it says on the box. You kill orcs in hundreds of different ways as they make their way to the end of the level. The premise is simple and it's fun to work out various strategies to kill orcs. Items, weapons, spells and weavers (special abilities) can all be used. Some levels are frustrating, though a bit of logical thinking goes a long way. The visuals are very smooth and fit into the laid back, humourous style of the game. The storyline and voice acting are a bit cheesy, but OMD doesn't take itself too seriously, which adds to the charm. Great game to play casually.
3338	1	a	It is the Best TW game Ever!
3469	1	a	Really good game!
1955	1	a	Fantastic game 8/10
2080	1	a	Ravage the land and conquer the sea as you play Empire Total War
5227	1	a	Does what it aims to accomplish, does an alright job. A little too much detail, bogs down progression. But it was fun!
220	1	a	Incredibly stress relieving fun. Build â¥â¥â¥â¥, kill orcs. Cest tous. :-)
2092	0	a	this is the only totaly war game that doesnt work for me.  totally broken, you play 10 minutes of it and it crashes. and units look â¥â¥â¥â¥ when you zoom out in battle, look like cardboard despite high end pc and top settings.  its unplayable because of the first fact, it crashes before you can enjoy it. its a shame really because if it managed to stay on without crashing out and booting you from game all the time it very well could have been a decent game.  but based on the fact it doesnt work i really cant reccomend this, especially due to the fact that every other total war game works perfectly for me with no crashes, this empire one is the only one out of entire series that dont work.  so basically avoid this â¥â¥â¥â¥ and buy one of the other total war games.
352	1	a	OH MY GOD. I didn't think that I was gonna enjoy this game as I'm enjoying it! I've seen a trailer once, and I thought it was an okay game. Now, I think this game is AMAZING! There are some cons to, but I think it's worth it! Any chance for a second one?
5294	1	a	I don't normally write reviews, so I'll just say a few blurbs.  I liked this game so much, I bought it 3 times. And once as a gift for a friend.   The 2nd one is coming out tomorrow. I'll buy it at launch, just because the developers have earned it from this game. And I normally wait for a huge sale, or GOTY edition before I spend any $.
3800	1	a	Sort of like Napoleon. Except with WAY Too many factions, HUGE AMONG OF HUGE MAP. Amurica :3. Did I mention Murica? :3? Oh and of Murica too? :3.  Way among of amazing. Im writing this during the steam sale which is making it 5 dollars. GET IT DURING THE SALE!!!!!!!!!! Good deal for 5 bucks!
4980	1	a	A fun top down shooter with depth and fun gameplay.
3347	1	a	Classic!
1708	1	a	just a perfect game it has som faults but it's still one of the best games I have'    I just wish you could play as Denmark and USA  I also would like if you could build consentration camps in Russia and get rid of them all hehe 
3318	1	a	This game is the best turn based strategy game ever made
593	1	a	More fun than I bargained for. Worth the purchase 100%!!!!
2249	0	a	Worst AI I've ever seen in a game, if you try attacking the enemys, your soldiers will just stand there, and watch the like 2 soldiers that actually try to attack die. This game is really bad, I'll take my refund now
4712	1	a	Definitely a fun game. Worth getting at any price. The game mechanics are easy to learn and the curve for skill does come in to play against the harder computers and in the arenas. And you get to kill Bounty Hunters, always fun!
1491	1	a	The Grand Campaign's map (SP) is so large. There's almost whole world geography. But; the diplomacy is not good enough. There's no way to liberate nations, request nations to get a war against another nation, breaking alliences, trading embargoes etc.  By the way there's same problem on the each game that Napoleon TW and Empire TW. It is an historical fail. Crimean Khanate, Degastan and Georgia talk in 'Russian Language' but in the history they talk in; Crimean Tatar, Chechen and Georgian languages.  And there's Greece talking in Turkish. It's kinda fail too.  Also there's lots of bugs and glitches on the MP of the Empire Total War. But I recommended this game because of the size of the map, being a fan of Total War and nation counts. There's lots of Major and Minor nations.
4619	1	a	A wondeful game in the Star Control genre, has some nice twists, a self managed difficulty, cool 2d graphics, some soundbites to chuckle over and ZOMBIES.. how could you resist..  Highly recommended
1022	1	a	Orcs + Traps = Bloody Fun
4625	1	a	Amazing game. So much to do and the fun never dies. Plenty of upgrades new ships and good story line also replayability make this a must buy.
1623	1	a	Amazing game! A must have!
3615	1	a	One of those Arcanum of Steamworks Magic Obscura situations where the game shipped broken and was never actually fixed. Thankfully in both cases people in the community have made patches for free that turn them into great games. Get darthmod for Empire, it's fiddly but is necessary not only because of the vast additional content but because the game mechanics are simply broken without it.
1419	1	a	it is a awesome game 
751	1	a	It's Lord of the Rings meets Sanctum in this brilliant action/tower defense game. From the moment you lay your first trap you will be drawn in by the distinctive characters. As the title implies there is only one objective, you must kill every last orc that charges into your keep. The myriad of traps at your disposal, as well as your keen sword and spells, get this task done with prejudice. It's wickedly entertaing and slightly demented watching the orcs hurl themselves into spinning blades and explosive barrels, all the while taunting you and laughing about their impending victory. I had childish glee when the hero started trash talking back. For a game with only one hero and a handful of enemy types it is dripping with charm and style. However it is not without minor issues. The animations could use a little more work and the single minded gameplay won't last forever, but these are barely worth mentioning. The dark sense of humor and the variety of death mark this as a must play8/10
394	1	a	This game is great!!!
4494	1	a	SPAZ is one hell of an action &amp; strategy game, with you taking command a small ship to eventually a large capital ship you'll be roaming the galaxy, attacking or working with 2 factions and even bounty hunters. Amazing game, if you're a fan of any strategy or top-down action shooters this is a must have!
2077	1	a	One of my all time favourite games in the Total War series a complete master piece! you can do basically everything on the campaign map and the campaign features are absouletly crazy! i like the Prussian army and the whole game is just amazing 9/10
252	0	a	This is a great, really fun game. Do yourself a favor though and get Orcs Must Die 2. It has everything this game has (including most the maps) and a whole lot more.
605	1	a	Best tower defense game I ever played. Setting traps is fun, especially once you unlock flingers and pushers, and having to mix it up yourself keeps it from getting slow or tedious. Plus if you like peons or Warhammer orcs, you'll love these too.
3282	1	a	The game is like a really big battlefield play ground for me. I love it.
295	1	a	Fantastic game. Overwhelmingly positive critics are well deserved indeed. From all the games where killing is fun and creative, this is pretty much as good as it gets: OMD does not flatter finests instincts, but after over 2 gazillions of dead orcs, you may still find the resources to find it hilarious.
4282	1	a	Awesome graphics and realistic but turn-based gameplay are the best. Once you start playing, you can't stop. Love the sea battles (CHAINSHOT SPAMMER HERE!!); land and seige battles are intense. (Played an online seige battle with a friend on June 7, 2016, I didn't know who would win, he had KO'd all my artillery from the get-go). Addictive game altogether.
4716	1	a	i loved this game now spaz2 is early access. BACKAROO BONZAI !!!!
3757	1	a	i shot and bayonette'd indians and british.   9/11
4261	1	a	Love this game, it's old, but gold.
163	1	a	One of the most fun 'tower defence' games ever.
2649	1	a	I have been playing this game since it came out. Its 2015 and Im still playin it. I have a bunch of different mods for it. My favorite is AUM 3.4 This is the best toal war game. Ive played them all. I will continue playin it until either steam folds or my clock runs out.
3494	1	a	This Game is awesome. It is worth the money because it is really interesting and at sometimes intense. Maybe Emotional a bit,cause im allways â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ when one of my generals or my king dies.
4453	1	a	First played when I was 11, and here I am at 22 still playing. Really wish there was a workshop though.
3119	1	a	Alone or with DarthMod, Empire: Total War is by far the game I like most of all the Total Wars. If you like Red Coat world domination, this is definitely a game that can satisfy your needs. Naval combat is nice, but can be a pain when controlling manually. Land combat offers nice variety of units, especially with the DLCs that, when in a bundle, are not to be upset over.  There is nothing like having a nice line infantry battle, so if you're into Patriot and Sharpe series, this is a game for you.
2239	1	a	'The Patriot' AKA :Empire: Total Warâ¢' is a fictional 2000 American historical war film directed by Roland Emmerich, written by Robert Rodat, and starring Mel Gibson, Chris Cooper, and Heath Ledger. It was produced by the Mutual Film Company and Centropolis Entertainment and was distributed by Columbia Pictures. The film mainly takes place in rural York County, South Carolina, and depicts the story of an American swept into the American Revolutionary War when his family is threatened. Benjamin Martin is a composite figure the scriptwriter claims is based on four real American Revolutionary War heroes: Andrew Pickens, Francis Marion, Daniel Morgan and Thomas Sumter.
4417	1	a	Its a decent enough game, massive overdose of content and the shooting doesent really work in it.  Buy it if you have plenty of time on your hands.
2929	1	a	best strategy games in 2009.i love it.but the storyline is so short
1793	1	a	Joe Fraiser would play this game!!!!
3736	1	a	you need to know history for bthis game 
1168	0	a	Well I tried to give this sorry excuse of a game another try. I purchased it when it first came out and the combat system was terrible. It takes like 10 rounds to beat goblins and imps. The enemy always has the advantage moving onto conveniently place focus points to screw you over and running like a little crap if you even get near killing one of its spell casters to another conveniently place spell power focus area. The computer will score criticals on your units and then immediately get another turn it seems due to 'good initiative.' I am sure the units get much better and each time I try to play this game it just flat out cheats. I will be a level 1 hero in the campaign and it will throw me against rogues and I have no chance of hitting them where they just take turns wasting my units.   Your hero is supposed to be the leader of these armies and to me they feel like a bunch of weaklings and it really takes away from the epic feel the game is trying to bestow. I was really hoping this would be a good patch and it started promising, but it failed again. I agree with many of the users that gave a negative review or even a posititve review, JUST PLAY DISCIPLES II IS A MUCH BETTER GAME! I don't understand how pitching six to eight units in a quick style combat is so hard for the Disciples III team to make. Start the battle and just have the units hit one another! No focus points or movement and all that crap! Make the units have significantly less HP and scale the difficulty! D+ only because the graphics and artwork are great.
4780	1	a	This game is cool.
3605	1	a	Great 4x game. The first 119 hours were pretty great, but the last hour got kinda stale.  Really though, it's satisfying to be Sweden and take over half of Europe with 4 armies. That's just my personal experience though.
4038	1	a	Great game, worth the money! 8/10
1977	0	a	Crashes, runs slowly, hard to read, Steam refuses to recognize when it's been exited and as a result despite having only played it for 5 minutes Steam says I played for 25 hours and refuses to give a refund after I explained this twice. Bad game, awful customer service
1364	1	a	-Playing as the United States -A prussian army lands and tries to invade America  11/10 for realism
2245	0	a	it's a fun game but it doesn't save my game for some reason, i'll push save and it won't
457	1	a	Bought for achievement in Orcs Must Die! 2, but now i think its much better for single player. It is a shame there is no co-op version for this game, but i still reccomend it!
2811	1	a	Got this at the discount price, pretty solid game esp. for the price. Good to kill time with.
115	1	a	Loved it! Funny challenging and engaging.    
1331	1	a	Dissapointed that you cannot play as Wallachia &amp; Moldova, as they weren't occupied by Ottomans at that time.  9.9/10
3345	1	a	Just simply amazing. A must play for RTS fans. 
5002	1	a	I'm not the type with time or patience for complicated games, however this game is not too simple that it's boring, and too complicated that it's tedious, it stoke a perfect balance for me. This game has an old school feel, I get a nice nostalgia feeling playing it, it's my favorite game at the moment.  We need more games like it, gameplay &gt; gfx ANYTIME !
5190	1	a	Space Pirates and Zombies appears at first glance nothing more than a retro style, 2d space shooter. But after playing it a lot, multiple playthroughs and challenges, it has a ton of depth lying beneath it's 2d surface.  You start as the leader of a small band of merchant pirates yourself seeking your fortune by collecting mineral deposits call rez. There are rumors of enormous stockpiles or rez near the core worlds so you set off to seek them out. Along the way you encounter zombies and eventually take on the gargantuan task of ridding the galaxy of them.  The first thing you do is set your world settings. There's multiple difficulty levels, 5 or 6 in total so you can vary your experience immensely, as well as settings for galaxy size, pirate density and tech distribution. You can create a unique experience for every game.  Once you are playing the game has three main areas. First is the galaxy and system maps. You travel to different systems and you can select various missions in each one to level up your crew, buy or steal tech and collect rez and ship designs. The systems all have different levels so you have to decide what you can potentially accomplish.  The next big part is your ship loadout screens, tech and hangar. In the tech screen you spend data (experience) that you have gather to level up various ship systems like beam weapons or shields. Each level increases the effectiveness of your systems and some levels are a prerequisite to advanced tech. Like you need level three beams to deploy particle beams or something. Then in the hanger you choose which hulls to use and what systems to put on them. You start with three hangars at the beginning of the game and get four by the end with larger capacity for larger hulls.  The final major area is actually flying your ships on the planet or area of interest screens. They aren't always combat screens, some missions you might gather rez for example. But while on these screens you can switch control between all your ships as well as issuing orders to the other ships to do certain things like rendezvous over here or attack this target. Sometimes pirates show up, sometimes zombies, all depends on the mission. I found there to be a good variety of events and missions.  The actual combat is extremely interesting if you make it challenging enough. Because there are so many types of ships and systems the way you fight can be varied. You might make a fast missile boat ship and whittle targets down while keeping out of their gun range. Or you might make a stealth capable ship, get in close and crush em with high powered beam cutters. Or maybe you want to use rotating turrets to track fast moving targets. It's up to you, there's no wrong way to do it, and a lot of times you have to adjust on the fly based on the tech available.  Hull designs are obtained by killing enemy ships of that hull. Sometimes one ship is enough but most need 3 or 4 blueprint pieces. Tech for subsystems like weapons, engines and all that is obtained from planets either by trading with them or blowing up their bases and taking it. There's also specialist crew members who give you distinct bonuses like +10% cannon damage. So that has to be taken into account as well.  In all there's a ton of ways to customize your game and your ships and it's very fun. I enjoyed leveling in this game immensely. The only downside is the hardest difficulties are REALLY hard and you end up basically grinding resources in low level areas to advance. But hard should be hard so I commend the devs for doing that. I guess you could fly smarter, not harder, if you're really good and get by with less.  Finally there's challenges too via a little space arena the pirates run. It's a good way to make money and there's some achievements with it. Some are very hard.  This game simply rocks and you have to try it.
1686	1	a	Best strategy game on the market
4660	1	a	A ton of fun at a low price. I only wish they'd come out with a sequel.
2697	1	a	This game is pretty amazing i love it it really adds the feel of the revolutnary era with enhanced naval warfare combat can be annoying since guns are were mainly used then but overall this game is awsome i highly recommend playing it
4347	1	a	why there is no workshop for this game?
3715	1	a	Amazing game, like the others in the Total War series.
1417	1	a	very interesting and fun game but can get boring at time, campaign is very good
4292	1	a	If you are thinking to buy this game or not, I will tell you, buy it!!, just buy it!!
806	1	a	Excelent game, highly recommended, try the demo.
2163	1	a	Brilliant game.Play this on Darth Mod &lt;3
2412	1	a	I so wish they make a sequel to this game....I love taking over the world as Prussia!!
4090	1	a	Amazing game. Pushes you to think of inventive battlefield strategies and bring out your inner general
102	1	a	It was alright
3813	1	a	my game stops working once you reach episode 3 but i love it LOVE the game
3626	1	a	Best total war game to date
478	1	a	So much fun playing it. recommend game to play
428	1	a	Awesome mix between Tower Defense games and action/RPG game (not that RPG-ish though)
473	1	a	I love this and the sequel. I love building, placing and managing the traps and seeing the mayhem happen and knowing where to assist the traps just constantly improving my 'dungeon'.
454	1	a	A frighteningly addictive game with a real sense of humour, the DLC is a sharp learning curve but the whole game is masses of fun
1324	1	a	Excellent and wonderful game. Not my first Total War, but by and by my favourite. Easy enough for casual players to pick up but offers a great depth of play for veterans of RTS and TBS games, whether you're into commanding an army in the battlefield, or if you're more into the politics of war.
2526	1	a	8/10 it is certainly one of the best stratregy games out there( probably beuz it is made by total war who r amazing and they fixed most of the problems in the game).  i like how they used more of range attacks though they could and in more melee death animations becuz sometimes when a person dies, they go into a animation for when they are shot. though, the game is really impressive with its large northern hemisphere map and its large scale battle.  i think the AI could still use more tweaking becuz they sometimes seem suicidal.   in conclusion, this is a great game for 20 dollars but if u are looking to spend more on a more refined game get Shogun 2. 
4181	1	a	Very fun to play, you get sucked into the 'lore' politics and grudges. You get a descent idea of how brutal and chaotic these battles were and how quickly they could change if one flank would break or even if an artillery unit would run out of amunition.  I love the sounds during battles, especially the from the fire-arms. CA get real props for that! absolutely barable graphics and since I am a huge musket, civil war, colony war fanboy I would recummend this game without a doubt.  p.s I know it says that I have only played 11 hours but I played a whole lot on a 'borrowed' copy. And appreciate the game to much to not pay the developers for it.
3410	1	a	Very good RTS game!
5315	1	a	 âProfessors Reviewâ¤
1446	1	a	Top Game, i would have my children with it if i could its that good
311	1	a	Slice, dice, crush, smash, fling, shatter, stab and shoot all the orcs you can. How much better can it get?
2961	1	a	One of my favorite RTS games to date.
497	1	a	After playing some OMD Unchained I decided to replay the first one and it's still as good as I remember. Sure, the second one has more stuff, a more interesting upgrade system, 2 player co-op and is overall the better game but the first one is still fun.  It has a better feel to kill orcs than Unchained and the progression pacing is more fluid. Maybe not worth the 10 bucks anymore as OMD2 is out for years but owning OMD1 gets you 10 extra levels in OMD2 so alone for this it's worth at least the sale price.
4331	1	a	When I first got this game I was told it was a waste of money. This is simply not true. It says i only have 46 hours but when i was without internet i played this game almost 24/7 for 2 years. It is such a replayable game and I highly recommend it to any fan of RTS or even Turn Based.
499	1	a	It has great replayability You have to constantly re-think best strategy to pass the level and to maximize the number of skulls It has several improvements on magic, devices as you level up Story is fun and is refreshing to hear the funny comments with those voices. It doesnt stuck me to the computer hour after hour,because passing each level is so rewarding that  I can play one level and have all the fun that I need for a long time in which I can work , talk with my family and other everyday thing  It a simply superb game , dont count the hours you can waste on it but all the satisfaction you will have with it
4334	1	a	&gt;Download darthmod &gt;Play as Native muricans &gt;Take over the Muricas &gt; Don't convert ports (Can only build one type of ships of natives) &gt;Build major fleet of screaming scalping warriors &gt;Invade EU &gt;Now i won &gt; Half the world is Cherroke &gt;the rest fears is, Finnaly shows us respect &gt;Now who is taking land from who &gt; Best game NA
89	1	a	It's a trap! Well, quite a few of them actually. And you can upgrade them. Orcs Must Die! puts a proactive spin on the tower defense genre. Different enemy types require tactical thinking and you'll find yourself going back to older levels to try new stregies. Fun!
2841	1	a	Good strategy game. A must have game for those who love strategy and wars I am pretty sure You will get addicted. Its give you feelings like you comanding the troops and leading them All in all must have.
391	1	a	Great fun game! If you enjoy Tower Defence games, then you will like this!
4170	1	a	This game is best
659	1	a	pretty good game if you just want to mess around and enjoy funny dialogue. theres worse things you could spend 15 bucks on
4664	1	a	best ten bucks I ever spent. I've played nothing else for the past week.
1087	1	a	Nice change up from the Tower Defense genre with the added fun of an FPS! I've spent plenty of hours on this already.
1503	1	a	First of all this game is awesome! 99/100!  This is a fantastic Strategy/War game. Great graphics with a good multiplayer experience. Pretty realistic and historically accurate with units and ships. There are 4 online gamemodes to choose from which are: Land, Sea, Siege and Scenario. If you like to control armies, then this game is for you! The single player campaigns are quite interesting and worth it. There are plenty of DLC's to get to make the game even better. Only some minor gliches where you somehow desync out of a match but other then that this game is great.  I really recommend this game. :)
3944	1	a	Excellent Strategy game, with good graphics, complex campaigns, and intense gameplay.
3888	1	a	Play this game, it is great.
4961	1	a	it's cheap now :D 2 euros =]
39	1	a	I'm enjoying this game a lot at the moment and it reminds me a lot of Dungeon Defenders. I purchased this and Orcs Must Die 2 in a Steam sale around a year ago I think and i definitely see myself replaying the game on Nightmare difficulty.  Your character is a funny war mage tasked with defending the various dungeons and bastions from an onslaught of ogres, kobolds and orcs. You get to control the war mage in third person as well as actively managing your traps.  Unlike some games you have to wait for a break or stoppage in waves to replace or build traps. In this game you can sell, and lay traps whilst the waves are happening (as long as you or an enemy aren't in the place you want to place your trap).  I felt like they could of expanded the story each level to give a sense of immersion, but the gameplay makes up for this flaw.  If you love tower defense games but want an alternative to your standard one then give this a try.  Pros:  - Fun Gameplay - Nice Assortment of Enemies - Quirky Main Protagonist - Plethora of Traps - Dynamic Trap Management - Cool Looking Artwork/Graphics  Cons:  - Not a very in-depth Storyline - Short Campaign - Graphics May not Appeal To Some - No Coop or Multiplayer Aspect. 
5258	1	a	Space Shoot 'em Up/RPG-ish mashup. Quite fun, though it gets a little repetitive towards the end.
599	1	a	Good for wasting 10 minutes in between doing other stuff.
4711	1	a	My alltime favorite schmup game. What is better than Pirates? Space pirates obviously. And what about adding a helping of zombie apocolypse? Command a small fleet of customized ships running missions with epic space battles with resource management &amp; technolgy unlocks. Solve your rather straightforward objectives through a variety of approaches (most of which revolve around decideding who to blow up). No one-way decisions or trade-offs here, full respec and the ability to recover from most blunders. All the while treated to a somewhat funny plot, over-the-top characters and excellent ambiance.  
3104	1	a	Colonial atrocities, fun for all the family! â¥â¥â¥â¥ing oohrah
128	1	a	A very fun third-person tower defense/strategy game from a person point of view. Great humor, fun story, goofy voice acting and atmosphere, later levels can provide a solid challenge to the more skilled players.
4352	1	a	tw games rule
1160	1	a	Akella sure knows how to confuse people with their Disciples 3 series. You got Renaissance, Resurrection and now Reincarnation. Well for me all goes as i can't get enough of this series, with game killing bugs and ridicilous difficulty spikes and all. Hard not to recommend (with caveats) this series to veterans of Disciples 2 as this one is now the one that Disciples 3 was supposed to look like.   Renaissance was not bad even though it had game killing bugs and certain 'press button to win' -tactics that is just an abomination when talking about wicked hard games like earlier Disciples games. Resurrection was a disaster. Don't even think about playing that one as it had game bugs that include graphics card glitches, unrealistic level up requirements and difficulty that went trough the roof once more. Reincarnation on other hand is the most recent one and it contains all the campaigns you need.   Disciples 2 remastered would be the best thing ever but until that happens this game will have to do. At least one does not get PTSD playing Reincarnation. Sometimes....do i dare to say it... the mood is quite 'casual' and you can just enjoy the terrible fates of the main characters.
3873	1	a	One of my favorites, while the gameplay was a little buggy I really enjoyed it and absolutely loved Napoleon: Total War(the expansion to this).
142	1	a	Something about the fact that the orcs die purely for my own entertainment creeps me out a little. And also makes me a little giddy on the inside like my big brother just won me a prize at the carnival by throwing baseballs at sad clowns.
4676	1	a	I spent a great portion of this game anxious, asking, 'where are the zombies?' Do not fret, my friend. THERE ARE ZOMBIES. 10/10
2371	1	a	There is allot to get use to but it is a good game.
88	1	a	Fun game love all the trap, wepaons and spells variations. Great game in my eyes worth the buy.
925	1	a	Great tower defence game.
3897	1	a	What can I say it's a total war game need I say more!!!!!!!! :)
3544	1	a	I am not a huge fan of strategy games but this is great. It has action to it because in games like civ 5 battles are dull bu here you command your troops and tell them what to do. But the naval combat is hard to get used to but the economy is actual really easy.
2079	1	a	Very good and strategic, especially with the Darthmod overhaul mod.
2692	1	a	Very fun game. Ai's diplomacy could've used some work. The Ai doesn't exactly think logically. But still, a very fun game, was able to bring Mother Royssia to glory.   7/10.
3485	1	a	really good gamevof this time :)
53	1	a	So many mangled/slashed/stabbed/burnt/crushed/melted orcs
4888	1	a	This game has great ship physics and customization. The galaxy is randomly generated and it lets you pick the size / difficulty. If you want a lot of game time out of this game id suggest a harder difficulty. But this is a game you can play through a couple times.
2242	0	a	Greetings to every future member of the chat rooms of blurry text and other unsolved problems! =)  It is a shame that so many people paid money for this strategic cake, but are not able to enjoy it. (I really tried to like it and to play it, but instead most of the play time comes from the try to fix the problems that came with the last patches)  On some PCs (my very new one included) the text is so blurry in all possible graphic configurations, it gives you a headache and makes the game unplayable. There is no problem solving until today, but there are a lot of threads with very friendly people where this problem is discussed (just look in the forum of steam for text issues or search your browser for blurry text empire).  So if you want to join the club, just pay the price here in the shop and you are maybe the next one that doesn't get a playable game, but contact with very friendly people. From this point of view it is really not expensive.^^  (I couldn't think about Empire being broken and never fixed, since I have no problem with other TW titles (Medieval II and Shogun 2). But I can just review my own experience and in this context I want to welcome all new members in the Empire chatrooms for frustrated people) cu
1434	1	a	Best Total War ever Created other than NTW
3608	1	a	Do you want to conquer the world as Prussia and kill the French and watch them run with the greatest army ever (true story)? do you want to kill the Russians for no reason? do you want to NOT be able to make people happy? Want to run the world without declaring war on ANYONE? Want to feel like the greatest leader of all time?   The game, in true total war style, is like Civilization and Age of Empires had a kid. The game is not prefect the loading times and turn times are VERY LONG. But the game is very good and is worth Every penny you spend! 
1796	1	a	It certainly is a very fun game, but taks a lot of time and dedication IMO. Easy settings you can roll over the world, the others are very pasisve. Higher difficulties though are challanging enough to be fun.   I recommend this to every strategy game/history enthusiast.
1761	1	a	Awesome game! Gunpower warfare in a RTS works so very well!
4411	1	a	Empire TW is one of those games that no matter how much time you have invested into it you can always start playing it again.
865	1	a	Nice game to waste some time. The challenges can be realy hard depending on the equipment you chose. I recommend you get the DLC 'Artifacts of Power' as it contains 2 very powerfull items. Overall its a realy good tower defence game where you sometimes have to fight on more than one frontline at the same time.
2089	1	a	would invade europe as the netherlands again
3346	1	a	Very immersive and engagaing for hours at a time!
809	1	a	Fun game. I guess I'd describe it as defense with traps instead of towers. Very similar to Dungeon Defenders, but where DD succeeded in its multiplayer, this game succeeds in its silly nature and delicious traps of death.
3826	1	a	whatch out to not get addic to it :|
854	1	a	You get a nice amount of choice of style in this Defense game, balancing between the amount of damage you do yourself and the amount of damage your traps do. And it's nice to see orcs explode in tiny bits or run screaming while they are on fire.  I would like it if there were more different lines of combad shouting. Perhaps in a DLC?
2391	1	a	&gt;Beats the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of Sweden &gt;Sweden surrenders &gt;France starts war with everyone &gt;Move my troops into Netherlands to recapture the land &gt;Paris is right infront of me WW1 all over again 10/10 Prussia&gt;All
1488	1	a	One of the Best 'Total War' games out there
4635	1	a	SPAZ is a really awesome game. Really simple to learn, but rewarding once you get into it a lot. A great time waster, but fun too.
21	1	a	This game is a blast it is easy and fun to play. The in game dialouge is funny and the story is understandable  RATE IT 8.5/10
4196	1	a	Love Total war but this is the start of their downfall. Simple game that anyone could have made with the budget CA has. Thankfully they're mods that really make this game great. So get mods if you buy this game.
242	1	a	Best tower defense / hack and slash i have ever played. Worth it's price and more.
3586	1	a	This game is great~ the vinalla is awesome but with Darthmod it's 100X's better i would defently buy it :D
4536	1	a	A great game which combines 2D with modern graphic capabilities. A vast gameplay that allows players to customize their play style, explore the unknown, enhance your spaceship arsenal, get involved in the factions evolved and enjoy the humorous storyline of the game. Spaceship models are well designed, weapons and modules too. And all the above have been developed by two people who happen to love such games and put a great effort into this game.
4759	1	a	Never thought a Indie-Game for about 5â¬ could cost me more than 100 hours
3215	1	a	An Amazing Game I Recomend it!!!!!!!!!!!!
4690	1	a	On sale for $1.99?! Buy it!
5176	1	a	Best top-down game since GTA2. Can't wait for the sequel. 10/10 That GOTY 2011 award is legit
498	1	a	Pretty nice game if you have little time. :)
107	1	a	Trap defense game that pits you against hordes of orcs with each their unique abilities. At your disposal you have a number of traps and spells to keep them at bay. One of the best things I liked about this game is that on other tower defense games when that one straggler makes it past your defenses you have to just sit and watch as it wakes right into your nexus. On OMD you have the option to run over there and kill that â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ yourself! Very child friendly but also mature and challenging enough for older audiences without seeming unfair.  4/5 One of the best tower defense games I've had the chance to play!
3367	1	a	Solid strategy game. Really revolutionized the Total War series, IMO. If there is one total game you should buy to try, it would be this one.
2921	0	a	A pretty decent game, but I would rate nearly all of the other Total War titles above Empire.
4072	0	a	It's a really good game, i mean, it's fun, decent graphics, loads of units, but any problems?  YES, the MP is â¥â¥â¥â¥ and it may work a few times, this game is only fun at MP, as of now, i don't reccomend you this game.
541	1	a	Its been years since ive played a game as entertaining as this!! the large amount of traps(allowing many combinations) and the large variation of fortresses(where in each you can find a certain advantage) allows one to play them over and over,another bonus is that every trap you unlock and every upgrade you buy is persistant so you can go to an earlier level to experiment with the new traps. the 'Nightmare' difficulty also picks up nicely where the war-mage dificulty ends. this game is all about making facing hordes of orcs fun and they have done a excellent job with that!!  the Quotes that the orcs spill are also funny. the Normal difficultty campaign took me about 8 hours to complete.
3991	1	a	A true Total War game best of its kind, totaly love this game 10/10
2538	1	a	Epic battles, World conquering fun!
112	1	a	+) I liked how the game was. Your view, aim, the battle, sound and effects, etc.  +) Various types of enemies were interesting.  +) The fact that basic traps don't become obsolete was good.   -) It would've been more nice if we could fight the witch or was it mage?.  -) They make you click a lot. They should've made it auto so you can just press on. Not everyone is using game pads.  -) Having passive skills or upgrade for personal improvement would've been amazing but there was no such thing. There is a similar one but that's a choice and you have to spend defense money so NO to that.
1822	1	a	This game is fantastic. The strategy aspect is pure genius and there is no possible way to make this game easy. Until you get the hang of it, it will be a great challenge.  UPDATE: 11/25/16 Game is still fantastic. That is all.
1188	0	a	Im not so sure about this game it seemed fun at first when i was playing the tutorial but the game seems so slow and bland it gets boring very fast and the spells are just stupid, seems like this game is perhaps an older and less evolved version of age of wonders which ive played the entire series of and absolutly love so when i saw this game i was exspecting something similar with its own twist but i was quite disappointed at its lack of customizabillity, options and combat expirence, i cant really recommend a game that left me feeling bored on the first level.
320	1	a	An entertaining and comedy-oriented trap dungeon defense game.  It took me a bit to get used to the trap difference vs the usual tower defense games I play - but it pans out well in a very entertaining, challenging and rewarding way. The traps set up have a limited area of effect and react on a reset timer for most of them, so its a mixture of combinations of traps and your own wits with weapons and the enviroment to pull it off well.  It proves to be a good game that is well worth its value.
4588	1	a	Space Pirates and Zombies is a point and click adventure game in the vein of Lucasarts classics such as Monkey Island, as well as Sierra classics such as Leisure Suit Larry and Police Quest. It tells the unlikely and comedic romatic tale of Space Pirates Falling in love with Zombies, and their misadventures as they try to make it work. With the Bounty Hunters addition, it turns into a love triangle and will tear at the strings of your heart. Youll laugh, youll cry, the writing is exceptional throughout the twists and turns of the story. Overall this game is a fantasic release from a studio run by just two gentlemen for a knack for releasing heartwarming adventure games. I look forward to their future releases. 8/10.
5030	1	a	Goofy name, amazing game.  Keeping it short this game is amazing if you're into customizable ships, strategic real time combat, and an open world to travel and explore as you see fit but with a storyline and a specific overall goal. In many ways it's kind of like a real time Space Rangers.   And it has a ton of replayability. There are a wide array of skills that dramatically increase the effectiveness of certain mutually exclusive parts (like a shield or a cloaking device) and also allow access to interesting and unique versions of said item. So for instance you might play through one game using cloaks and missiles, whereas another game you might not use a cloak or a shield and instead rely on armor, hull and improving the capability of your crew to repair damage while you're taking it. Options, options, options. All quite well balanced and viable, even if some are 'more viable' than others. 
3563	1	a	I haven't played that much, but it's pretty fun I guess. I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys watching colonial soldiers line up in rows and stand there calmly while the enemy shoots at them.   9.9/10 because Austria's a little b**ch!

4157	1	a	This is an excellent game. In my view it is unsurpassed by any Total War game since, and even holds its own when compared to earlier titles such as Rome (1) Total War.  The campaign map is very pretty, and the size of the map and division into three theatres works very well. The province management/city construction system is a cool innovation from previous games. The research system is also a welcome feature which helps immerse you in the historical period. Naval battles are also   I rate it 8.5/10.
3592	1	a	Empire: Total War is the finest of the Total War line of games. The breadth and scope of the game is amazing, offering many options for play. Of all of the Total War games that I own (I own them all), Empire is the one to which I continue to return.
2854	1	a	Not the best Total Wars in terms of battles on land, but ship battles and campaigns in this game are amazing.
396	1	a	A unique twist in the tower defense genre, charming character design and personality, amazing gameplay and it's just too damn fun to play. Buy this now
3168	1	a	A must have for Total War enthusiasts!
4504	1	a	Missing Star Control and Space Rangers type of games? Grab SPAZ.
1917	1	a	A must have game for any pc gamer. Extensive singleplayer with endless possibilities, multiplayer was limited, more so as a public player, however clan warfare was exciting and enhanced the experience.  9.5/10 pipes
2694	1	a	Challanging campaign and battle!, if you play on hard &gt;:D
2318	1	a	This game is ultimate to the MAX!!!! it includes real battles that actualy happend!!! lots of stratagy and can play co-op battles with friends, this game isnt a waste of money and should be played!!!!
2296	1	a	A lot of people claim this game is buggy. It isn't. I have over 600 hours on my laptop and 300 hours on my desktop and I can assure you I have only encountered one bug. Cavalry sometimes gets its pathfinding confused and fails to take a direct route. The game world is huge. Combat stretches across continants and oceans and the unit diversity is massive. The game is further enhanced by mods which add countless hours of replayability. Enjoy!
31	1	a	Orcs Must Die is just an amazing game, you'll have a smile on my face every moment you're in game.   The title pretty much explains the basics of the game, but without mentioning the best part, the traps!  The game is a tower defence/Third person shooter in which you must defend the rift in each castle. The rift is basically a portal from the orcs world to the human world, if too many orcs make it through the portal, the game is lost.  You start off with a few simple traps, a sword, and the always equipped crossbow. But as you get further into the game you will unlock new traps and eventually upgrade your traps with skulls, which are unlocked depending on how well you do in a level. As you progress through the game you will unlock more slots to equip different traps, these are kept if you go back to a previous level, which you might not have done so well on (or maybe you did really well and are replaying it because it's so much fun).   At the beginning of each level the game tells you where the orcs will come from, the route they will take and the types of enemies you will encounter during that level. The levels are divided into waves, the gap between waves is really a quick break in which you have time to place some traps with the money you have collected protecting that rift.   Levels are only short which makes it a great game to fill in time whilst having fun. The art style is also great and fits perfectly with the gameplay, and some of the cheeky comments the War Mage makes. The soundtrack is really upbeat and part of what makes you so happy playing this game.  The only downside to this game is that, unlike its sequel, it is only single player.  But overall Orc Must Die is a great game for any casual gamer, especially those that are fans of both the action and strategy genres.
4214	0	a	Missed chance by CA of making a grand strategy game. Perhaps the era will be revisted one day, but until then not even mods can save this buggy unstable game.
1386	1	a	1. Play Prussia 2. Invade Poland &amp; Russia  3. Hitler is happy
482	1	a	The first 3 levels were boring as hell, and should have been a 'tutorial'. After that it got much better.  It's ultimately a Tower Defense game, but the 3rd Person Shooter perspective makes it more fun. Being able to fight manually gives something extra to do between placing traps, and gives you a nice perspective to watch all the orcs die.
3395	1	a	I enjoy all the total wars, playing a game that I am familiar with is always nice.  I did enjoy the combat element with guns, may not of worked aswell as previous total wars that focused more on melee but it was a good effort.  
447	1	a	awesome tower defence based game.

Instead of keeping an ear open to the only people who matter, the greed of these individuals has peaked. Don't buy from them ever.
2429	1	a	I would give this game an 8.2/10 Like the global domination and powerful armies  I disliked the Naval battles, could use some tinkering in the land combat aswell. I also found getting negative opinions for territorial expansion was too high for every time you capture a region, or not needed for many regions depending on the country you chose.
489	1	a	sauron hates this game
5308	1	a	Oh man. Where to even begin with this one. It would be an extreme disservice to simply call Arma 3 a shooter, as it is so, so much more than that. Arma 3 is a military simulator. This is a distinction that itâs developers hold sacred and are proud of, and one to which I can attest is completely accurate and deserved. But itâs even more than that. Arma 3 is a gaming platform, upon which so much has already been and will continue to be built for years to come.   At its core though, Arma 3 in a supremely excellent military sim. The graphics are stunning, the gameplay is excellent, the mechanics are solid, and Bohemia Interactive has done an absolutely amazing job packaging this all together. New comers to the Arma series (as I was) may initially be overwhelmed by the gameâs complex mechanics and decidedly different pace from your typical FPS/shooter. Enemy engagements happen at much greater distance than is typical in the genre and are often brief, brutal, and more times than not will conclude with your demise. There is no handholding here. No mini-maps, no enemy UI icons/indicators, no hit markers, no health bars. If you get shot a couple of times, you will find yourself unceremoniously dispatched. While this creates a high barrier for entry and a steep learning curve for new players, it provides a unique and distinctive play style. Situational awareness, cover, teamwork, suppressive fire, and generally moving purposefully and as if your â¥â¥â¥ depended on knowing what was behind the next ridge or hiding in the bushes are paramount to your success. Add to these infantry mechanics the amazingly rendered vehicles, armor, helicopters, and planes, each with their own realistic mechanics to learn and master, and you end up with a truly amazing military simulation experience.   Out of the box, Arma comes with a great single player campaign comprised of 3 separate acts, each containing ~12-15 missions. The campaign focuses on a well crafted story of a military conflict that has erupted over Arma 3âs two HUGE islands of Stratis and Altis. You play the part of a NATO soldier who finds himself stuck in the middle of a complex engagement. The campaign is rewarding, and challenging. (I have yet to complete it as Iâm stuck on one mission that I simply canât seem to complete.)  However the single-player campaign is FAR from the end of this title. The mission editing tools have allowed this amazing community to develop some absolutely awesome single player missions, all of which can be downloaded free of charge from the Steam workshop and numerous other sites around the interwebs. I would also recommend you check out the supremely excellent full game conversion single player mods Whole Lotta Altis and Dynamic Universal War System which will provide countless additional single player hours and could be completely stand alone titles in themselves.  Oh and the multiplayer, oh god the multiplayer. Wasteland, King of the Hill, Invade and Annex, Battle Royale, Breaking Point, so many Co-Op opportunities, the amazing looking upcoming Epoch (currently in closed Alpha). Iâm sure there are so many others that I havenât even discovered yet. Each of these represent COMPLETELY USER GENERATED and totally disparate ways to play Multiplayer within the Arma 3 platform. By purchasing Arma 3, you immediately have access to each of these completely gratis and each could essentially be considered totally separate game.  In wrapping up this lengthy review, Arma 3 is an amazing experience and a true accomplishment in game development. It is the only game in recent memory that I can say with confidence that I never get bored with playing. Bohemia Interactive has made it clear that they plan to support this game for years to come, and they have built something amazing on which the possibilities are truly endless.   Purchase this game. Purchase it now. Thank me later.   (IF YOU DO NOT FIND MY REVIEW HELPFUL, please leave a comment as to why. I welcome the constructive feedback.)
4857	1	a	Possibly one of the best indie games of the year. Also it's only $5.
4407	1	a	The variety of Factions and Historic Empires. Pluses prior to Mods added to this with reasonable DLC. The youtube community and the CA DEV TM are excellant people . Downside was the age of this game in Engine years it can cunk even on robust systems. The Micro or add on DLC Campaigns were consistant to what we expected from past CA fare. Have started with the Wonderful Shogun. As a History buff and Studier We enjoyed growing with this Historic flavoured Sim of ancent life. In cultures the degree of detail in uniforms sound and leaving the blood packs optional all added to a experiance  that was positive and not too complicated. Sometimes replay is better given a break to refreash and view others works in the Art of War. Some AI gripes in other Total Wars like the Greek for Rome II but the map styles are nice giving your immersion a chance to see new cities left out of the origional was nice. Wish for a ETW II Victorian includign Asia and Western America =SB=^-^
4204	1	a	An excellent real time strategy game with a massive modification community.
4544	1	a	Fantastic space RPG/arcade shooter with meny hours of gameplay. Reminds me of Elite 2 I played on my Amega 1200.  
4739	1	a	Buy this game, seriously, do it now. Had it for 2 days and ranked up 13 hours of gameplay already and by the looks of things I'm not even half way though the game yet. Different layout each time you play though due to randomly generated maps. There is a little message that pops up at the start of the game that explains that it was made by two guys working out of their homes for 2 years but how it plays you would think it was made by a standard developer.
581	1	a	What tower defence looks like in the future, but now...
2255	0	a	game always sticks after about 300 turns....tried and wasted a lot of time on it
1535	1	a	This is one of the best games i have ever played.
3020	1	a	This is a well crafted fun militaristic game. I like how the units will fire in neat and organized volleys instead of firing at their own pace. The only downside I could see to this game is that practically all the nations have the exact same units with the exact same uniforms but in different colored uniforms. All in all, I highly suggest this.
5142	1	a	Awesome space game. It's got customization and interesting combat as well as a randomly generated open galaxy.
2563	1	a	Very enjoyable game. This was my first game that I had ever put over 100 hours into.   9/10
1832	1	a	Anyone who likes TW games, buy it!!
1343	1	a	I conquered the world as the French, 'nuff said.
1854	1	a	The only and best line battle simulator on the Steam store :P  Variety of factions to play from including five Native Tribes: Iriquois, Pueblo, Cherokee, Plains, and Huron Wyndot. Not to mention the fierce Ottoman Empire   Authentic and detailed naval battles and simulation for those classic wooden, sail, and cannon warships used in the 18th century  Active multiplayer community  Plenty of interesting and relevant quotes in the loading screens; loading screens are beautiful too  Graphics still hold up for a 2009 game   Though, the AI runs away constantly in the Warpath campaign, and siege battles become redundant as the AI won't utilize the walls. Also note, some people like to spam artillery and light dragoons and light infantry, resulting in hit and run  Recommend at base price or bundles that include all the DLC
4829	1	a	I really enjoyed this game. It does have too much grinding and the end game could of been done a lot better, but it still has a very addicting quality to it.
1570	1	a	Very Great Game.
3630	1	a	bitt buggy but just realy good
2561	1	a	This game is really fun in all honest if you like historical games this one is for you. Now in someways this game is more complex yet more streamlined than the other Total Wars diplomacy is much easier to do and it gives you a warning when you're about to go into debt which could happen very easily in the past Total War games. I recommend this game very much.
24	1	a	This is a great game. I was hesitant at first, but a third person tower defense game kept me entertained for hours. I managed to get the second one as well. It's a fairly difficult game, depending on your skill level.  
97	1	a	PC Gamer is right. This game has a limited scope but within that scope it does it's thing extremely well. It's like an action puzzle, how to lay your traps and fight so that no orcs get through. The cartoony 3D environments are pretty and the variety of approaches to each scenario are a blast.
2387	1	a	A very addictive turn based strategy game that encompasses war, politics and economics on a global scale.
513	1	a	This game is ridiculously fun. A bit short, I finished the game in about two days. Orcs Must Die! Definitely has the best twist on tower defense: third person.
207	1	a	Lay traps and keep killing orcs and their allies, bit like a zombie game except more fun!!!!!
1501	1	a	At the core of the game, its great. if you buy this game make sure you go on the total war centre and download the ' DarthMod ' mod . This mod fixes all the AI issues and adds new factions from the start as well as adding new units . The base game is good but the AI just ruins it for me and the mod is very easy to install and use.
848	1	a	'WINNING' man this games so much fun it's a mix of pre strag and real time it's has some funny one linners.
3334	1	a	While perhaps not the greatest installation in the Total War series, Empire Total War still has it's upside. Mods are almost essential to avoid any of the bugs in its almost haphazardly put together engine, but once those are avoided it can be a worth while experience. An interesting game if 18th century warfare interests you at all.
3127	1	a	Recommend it a lot for RTS-lovers. Huge map, you can conquer North, Central and part of South America, part of Asia and Europe. Doesn't have good graphics like Napoleon Total War but it has more possibilities of gameplay.
2132	1	a	You can be the Swedish Empire and prevent the Russian Empire from happening Best game ever I rate it Carolus Rex/10
4644	1	a	Love this game. Is definitely one of my all-time favorites. Don't get enough time to play it.
5299	1	a	More people should play this game, ridiculously well-done for an indy title
3389	1	a	Empire Total war is an amazing game taking you into the era of colonization around the days of the american revolution. In the offline mode you can play as several different countries ranging from Great Britain to the ottoman empire.  The campaing map expands over the entire known world leaving nothing out of your wrathulpath to world domination. I spent numerous hours finding which country I liked best then set out to conqueor the world taking over europe first then reaching into the americas. In order to do this you must manage your economies and keep your people happy or they wont support your conquest overthrowing you and taking back their land.  This was my first total war game and probably one of my favorite. It comes highly reccomended if you like strategy games. It also has a online play where you can create your army and fight other people.
4989	1	a	Awesome top-down space physics combat shooter!
2225	0	a	I quit playing after I conquered all of western Europe as Prussia in 50 years. The game is too easy and you can't play as any small, weak nations like Bavaria or Westphalia to make it more challenging (the have mods for it though). If you want to buy a game like this look somewhere else there are plenty of other good games. Unless you're looking for battle simulation, then this game is good for you. If you do want battle simulation don't by this game specifically though as they have other games that were made more recently. I prefer grand strategy empire building fun with ACTUAL challenges. 4/10
1010	1	a	Amazing!! I played this on my friends PC and bought it without a single thought!! lol
3851	1	a	Although it is now an older total war game, with the help of mods and its massive campaign map, it is still one of the best total war games out there. Diversity from the east and the steppes to Europe to the Americas. Whether you are a TW veteran or new to the series, I would highly recommend Empire Total War.
4607	1	a	Simply fantastic. If you are looking for a good old 2D space adventure game where you can: a) Unlock many different ships, weapons and components, b) Upgrade various aspects of your ships, c) Be a pirate and prey on civilian ships, d) Bribe officials and manipulate relations with the police or the civilians, e) Use a massive battleship to blast a starbase to pieces and collect the loot because you didn't want to pay them for it, f) Participate in bounty hunter battle events and win their respect, g) Use this respect to order the bounty hunters to attack a warp gate blockade for you, h) Fight zombies, i) Battle squads of enemy ships and blow them to bits, and pick up the jettisoned crew to join your ranks, j) Rampage through the galaxy and cause general chaos in each individual solar system... then you should buy this game.  The devs said that they created SPAZ because they couldn't find games like it anymore. This is sadly true, but now you can play this game so it's all okay. It is not the most fast-paced or the most action-packed game (although big battles are quite exciting) but it doesn't try to be. It is just a completely amazing space adventure that lets you choose where to go next and what to do when you get there.  You are let loose in a galaxy that you design (for the most part), and you are free to explore solar systems, mess around with politics, and level yourself up so you can venture into harder areas. To get to a new system you have to either destroy the UTA (police) warp gate blockade, bribe them with goons, or use bounty hunters to clear the blockade for you. You can then continue to the next system, and because there is no communication between systems, the people there will have no clue what you have been up to. In each system there are small, basic missions that you can do, and occasionally a conflict pops up between the two sides, which you can join in.  There IS a storyline, which is quite intriguing, but the story missions are relatively few and quickly jump to much harder areas. You have to explore and level up before continuing on, but you can do the story whenever you really want, or if you get bored of exploring all the other solar systems, because they are mostly the same, and when you have acquired all of the blueprints that you get from lower-level systems, there is not really much need to go all the way around the galaxy. But it's still fun to go to every place, especially if you are someone who loves exploration.  There are lots of ships of varying sizes and all of them are designed for a different purpose. You can easily change between ship designs and equip different weapons and support modules. Later on in the story you get more hangars, which means more ships. You can only control one at a time but you can freely swap between them, and the AI controls the others. You can give orders to your AI-controlled ships, although they can be pretty frustratingly stupid sometimes. Especially when armed with huge bombs, because they fire them off everywhere as soon as they reload, usually causing high damage to you or friendly ships, which quickly turn hostile.  Combat ranges from not-all-that-interesting with smaller ships, to exciting, lasers-and-giant-explosions when several large ships are pitted against each other. Many small details have been perfected in this game, some of which are: shockwaves from exploding ships will damage anything that is too close, and firing on one side of a ship will wear down the armour and allow you to deal more damage, as well as causing minerals and crew members to be sucked out into space through breaches in the hull.  Yes, there are zombies in this game. They are found in the central solar systems. They are very annoying (they have a tendency to split and create more, and there are lots of them) and can be dangerous and head to deal with if you are not careful. Luckily, both the Civs and the UTA hate the zombies as well, and there are often conflicts between zombies and one or both of them.  The graphics are nice, the backgrounds are nice, the ships all look nice, the explosions are nice, sound effects are nice, everything I have mentioned previously in this review is nice. You might not like this type of game and that's fine, but if you are remotely interested in the concept then you should definitely buy it. The price is overly reasonable, especially on sale. Recommended.
2551	1	a	Epic Total War in an epic time period. Can't get enough.  Also: use Darthmod.
4611	1	a	This game started maybe a bit boring but it became better and better every minute i playd. Several twists and changes kept me entertained for more than 50 hours. Definitly a great game with lot of fun.
4517	1	a	There are those indie games that truly captivate your attention and keep you engaged for hours on end, and you know it's a gem when you find yourself spending the whole evening mining, collecting, running and blasting your way through zombie space.  MiniMax Game's Space Pirates and Zombies was developed by two blokes in Canada and boy, for two guys this game sure does outstand in the indie pool. You start out as a little 4-hardpoint ship, just plunderin' the good plunder. As you progress through the story you'll find out something crazy has stirred up at the centre of the universe. Something that allows flesh eating monstrosities to biologically enhance and drive their own ships, despite being mindless husks. The story has an enormous gravity to it; as the plot progresses, your fleet of AI-controlled ships, blueprints, hull types, weapon types, subsystem effectiveness, mining ability and the like go on the up as well. Doing this makes the player feel the gravity of the situation: there's a huge threat of space zombies capable of surviving without oxyen floating about at the center of the universe and you're going to need all the help you can get.  I suppose the reason why I find this game so enjoyable is an amalgamation of perfect game dynamics; the tactical RTS-like command of your own ship, with a main player-controlled ship and up to 4 other AI controlled ships, all of which are available for the player to directly take control of any time during flight. Missions are undertaken for either the civillians of a star system or the UTA - the universe's private military force, and doing favours for one faction often angers the other. The ever expansive tech tree is a delight, as well - research data, the space equivalent of experience points become increasingly important to get that rank of weaponary, subsystem, engines, or armour that you know you're going to need at the current system. As time seems to go forward when you jump from planet to planet and star to star, the players get used to planning a route according to a star systems ecosysem, 'difficulty' (measured in civillian or UTA strength) and managability.   With the addition of vicious money-hungry bounty hunters to the mix, I've never enjoyed any space-sim-top-down-physics-based-shooter as I have with this. I've found myself dedicating chunks of my gaming sessions to mining, exploring, trading, or fighting in this game. And when you finally get all the blueprints, all the ship hulls, and high-tier tech skill upgrades, you're still finding yourself having a blast dealing with pesky space zombies. In a nutshell, I haven't quite experianced any game like this but I can sum it up into two expressions: YARR and BRAINS.
1542	1	a	Wonderfull game with hours of entertainment! LOVE this game. From my opinion one of the best in th total war series. Sale?:BUY No sale?:BUY
4753	1	a	addictive game
1021	1	a	So much fun. Wish I could have more orcs and more money.
1173	1	a	If you played Disciples and/or Disciples II, and did not like what Disciples III had become (Disciples III: Renaissance and/or Disciples III: Ressurection), give Reincarnation a try! Same goes for fans of HoMM series, this version of Disciples can give you a fresh experience.  This is the most recent and best developed version. Reincarnation binds all Disciples III content together (Renaissance + Ressurection), with heavily revamped maps, completely changed gameplay(Back to the old style, more like the first 2 games), and is not as unforgiving as before. (Ironically the first mission of the easiest campaign(Imperials) was the most difficult mission in the game) Maps are now a lot more open, you're no longer limited to a single path, and enemy armies twice as strong as you no longer come for you after just a few turns. If you are used to the challenge Disciples Series has given so far, I do recommend highest difficulty, as the only downside to this version is the challenge has been lowered considerably - But this is also a huge upside, as some missions and places simply were too difficult (I do enjoy a challenge, like old skool games gave, but at some point it's no longer fun to either keep restarting from scratch or act like a save junkie to abuse your way trough a single battle.)  I've spend hundreds of hours on Disciples II. Had so much fun with that. Then when Disciples III came, I never thought I'd enjoy a Disciples game again. So much had changed, for the worse. Luckily, I was not the only one who thought this way. The community worked together with the devs to bring out Disciples III: Reincarnation, the way Disciples III should have been in the first place. It's just too bad a lot of fans of the series will never even know about this. I reckon most will easily confuse this with the earlier Disciples III games, unaware the game changed so much in the meantime.
3454	1	a	Hours of gameplay that seems to never end. I love the feel of this game so much
192	1	a	Great game ,easy at first but harder at the end ,  lots of cool items and traps , the only thing i miss in a multipalayer mode/map
4165	1	a	This is a good Game. I am surprised they haven't created a Empire total War 2. You can build a Empire, of course, and change history. Such as The US Invading Britain during the War of 1812, And well, just create the world you Want. They should of made a Empire Total War 2.
304	1	a	Gameplay : easy Atmosphere : good A wonderful tower defense game
4840	1	a	Love games of this style, and glad to see one so well done. Some might feel it gets a bit repetitive at points, mostly when you have to grind up some levels to advance the main story, but it's still highly enjoyable gameplay. All of the tech upgrades, unlocking different ship types, and finding all of the weaponry blueprints keeps things exciting. It's a good price too.
4627	1	a	What can I say? Brilliant. Simple. Ok, well this game is the kind that you can return too again and again. Randomly created game every time and a great ship/customise inventory. Controls are simple enough and the early game balance is gentle but with enough challenge to get you hooked. All in all I cannot recommend it enough.
403	1	a	Incredibly fun! It's plants vs. zombies on overdrive! Set your traps and watch the fun!
2416	1	a	Best Total War game ever!!
1494	1	a	Love The Game!
2523	1	a	Guts and Glory, musket and cannon. You should play this and aim for total world domination. Too bad that the multiplayer is dead.
4434	1	a	Pros: Excellent strategy game for its time and still today. In general, much more refined and fun gameplay compared to previous AoEs with more of an emphasis on combat, rather than micromanaging villagers. Still has decent graphics even by today's standards.  Cons: The French.  11/10 would buy again.
4381	1	a	'WHAT 15 HOURS!!!!!!!!!! Ow well at least the world is finaly mine!' this is one of the best harcore statigy games in the world todate
34	1	a	Better than i thought it would be. 10/10
3648	1	a	Empire Total War has, in my opinion, the best gameplay on the campaing map with a solid in depth economical and diplomatic gameplay while keeping the game still easy to play. I also love the era it is set!
825	1	a	The game can easily be summed up by its title. Orcs Must Die is about making a large amount of orcs into a large amount of dead orcs (and orc pieces). Of course, there's more to it than simply 'Use crossbow on orc' as there are a number of fiendish traps, magic, and AI guardians that you can employ, making it something akin to a tower-defence game. There's more focus on action, though, as you're encouraged to jump in and do your part in causing a bit of death and dismemberment of your own. On top of it all is a somewhat basic story, though there is so much character and humor packed in that it still seems fresh and entertaining. To call the game 'mindless fun' would be a little misleading as there is some strategy involved in trap placement and personal upgrades, but the real fun lies in watching a group of clueless orcs wandering towards a corridor full of all manner of blades and spikes and being reduced to 'orc salsa' while you giggle softly to yourself.
2289	0	a	I don't understand why anyone would like this game, im just glad I bought it when it only costed 4.99. First of all, this game is incredibly buggy and slow paced. Second, the controls are downright aweful and very hard to get used to. Third of all, it has very little content and is incredibly boring.
4505	1	a	This is a very good game for its price, it is a old fashion top down action game with a basic fleet controle function.  I heighly recomend this game to every one, definatly if its on sale. If your unsure about it try the demo out and see what you think.  10/10
4736	1	a	One hell of a game!!!
5257	1	a	After I understood the game (controls/menu/what am I doing?) I've got to say: One of the best indie games I've played so far. The soundeffects are a bit lowfi, but it has modding ablities, so maybe theres a way to replace them. Doesn't really affect the overall manifique experience
2113	1	a	brilliant game, hours of fun and i would reccomend it to anyone! you should have a pretty decent computer to run it well though
4665	1	a	Pure awesomeness. Waiting for second SPAZ(ABH:)). Sad that the next one will not be in 2D, but we'll see...
3502	1	a	I recommend this game to anyone who likes buggy software.
1335	1	a	buy it youll love it.....
3380	1	a	Featuring the biggest and in my opinion, the best map, in the Total war game series; Empire Total War is a must play for people who like the age of Gunpowder Warfare and Colonization.  While the game has a great map and a large variety of factions, I would recommend that you play it with mods for the full and best experience; sadly the vanilla version of the game wasn't up to standards, the addition of a few mods though is the only thing one would need to enhance this game to what it should be.  In short, buy this if: -You like muskets. -You like great coats. -You like marching bands. -Tricorns and BICORNS!?! -Pirates -Biggest map that any total war game has had to date. -a whole load of other stuff that you'd expect would come with the time period.
3803	1	a	Have played this game for hours an hours an love it. I continue to come back to this game. I have bought some of the additional DLC units which does increase fun but not a must.
5098	1	a	Great game if you like:  Space combat Zombies Exploration 15-20 Hours of game play
1808	1	a	Greatest game ever! Especially with Darthmod 8.01 Platinum!
2925	1	a	A really great game if you're new to grand strategy games. The game mechanics are easy to use but allow you to do rather complex things when you're in a battle e.g. skirmish formation for light infantry, diamond formation for cavalry (once you've researched it) and square formation for line infantry to fend off cavalry attacks.  The downside to this game is the campaign map. I'd like it if there were slightly more regions to conquer and the diplomacy in the campaign is primitive. For example when you're negotiating with another country their answers seem to be completely random; there seems to be no logic in their answers at all, even if I'm offering them a deal they cannot refuse.  Having said that, I think that the actual battles make up for the slightly basic campaign. I would recommend for beginners.
5264	1	a	Awesome game. Get it!
614	1	a	there is only one word to describe this game..... AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!
1508	1	a	empire total war if you compair it too the other titles of current , it has a lot to be desired , mods bring it alive , dont get me wrong its great to play sometimes but it just seems too.... out of touch overall 6/10
5140	1	a	Yes, this a great game. I played it during the time were is was freely avaiable for a weekend an clocked like 30 hours on in. Its a great game 8.5/10
5296	1	a	Welcome to Space Pirates And Zombies (And Bounty Hunters)!    This is a game for all who love to be able to do some customization to their spaceship, explore the galaxy, form alliances and upgrade their ship in diffrent ways. This game also has an interesting plot and you learn more about it as you go.  Just want to say something before you start: Civs = Civilians UTA = United Terran Alliance    HUGE GALAXY TO EXPLORE: There can be up to 300 star systems to explore! And each one has a few diffrent areas (like planets, junk yards, awesome empty space, toxic waste dumpyards, asteroid fields) where you will find the mission, event and conflict zones. But even if the area doesn't currently have a mission in it, some valuable resources can still be found there.    BLUEPRINTS AND BLACK BOXES: There are Tiny, Small, Medium, Large and Huge hulls to choose from, you get new ones by picking up black boxes (drops from Civilian, UTA, Bounty Hunter and Zombie ships when they explode) or hacking the ships with a special kind of 'weapon'. All mid to late game ship hulls need multiple black boxes to be fully unlocked.  There is a wide variety of beams, cannons, launchers, bombs, mines, drones, turrets, subsystems, armor, reactors, engines, shields and cloaks to choose from. You can buy the blueprints from the Civilians (refugees who fled from Earth) and the UTA (some kind of corrupt space police). Some items need multiple blueprints before you fully unlock them, and to be able to use the stronger weapons, you need to do some research with data you collect. Data drops from ships belonging to the Civs, the UTA, the Bounty Hunters or the Zombies, but you could just do some missions to get it.    SPACE STATIONS: All 4 factions (Civs, UTA, Bounty Hunters and Zombies) have their own space stations, and these space stations can come in diffrent sizes. The Civilians have Mining, Science and Colony space stations, each one of those come in 3 diffrent sizes. The UTA just have 3 sizes of Security Stations. The Bounty Hunters have Outposts and Bounty Hunter Strongholds. Known Zobie space stations: Infested Outpost, Heart, Artery.    RESPECT AND BOUNTY: The UTA blockade the stargates which you need to open first if you want to be able to go to the next star system. To do so you either attack them, bribe them at the UTA's base (with goons of course), or hire a raid on the gates at the Bounty Hunters' base (although hiring a raid causes you to lose the Bounty Hunters' respect).  The Bounty Hunters (Space Pirates) will attack you if you have alot of bounty on your head (destroying the other factions' ships or starbases puts bounty on your head). You should try to prevent getting too much bounty (as their ships are armed to the teeth). But getting high bounty on purpose to draw their ships out for the black boxes is a very good idea. A fast way to get bounty is in Conflicts, here the Civs and UTA forces colide in an inhabited system and start killing off each other.  But to stop them from coming after you, you have to earn their 'respect'. Destroy their ships, pay the bounty, compete in their own personal arena or do certain missions to earn respect.    MISSIONS AND AMBIENT EVENTS: In each system the UTA and the Civilians will offer you lots of diffrent missions. There's also your Main Missions, Secondary Missions and Ambient Events that you should probably try to do once you see them (both for the rewards and the lore).  The Main Missions are very hard to do, but if you succeed, you will be handsomely rewarded for your efforts (sometimes). You also have to do the Main Missions to upgrade your mothership for a bigger hangar and better specialists. The bigger the hanger, the more ships you can have active at once. You can also put bigger ship hulls on then.  Secondary Missions also have a bit of lore in them and reward you with rez, data, specialists and have nice ships in them to destroy for the black boxes.  Side Missions also have nice rewards you get when you complete them, including some specialsists.  Ambient Events are a very for the loot there is to be found when doing them, here's some examples: Comet Spotted, Traffic Jam, Wreck Field, Observation Outpost, Cheap Motel. Buy the game and find out what riches there are to be found!    SPECIALISTS: By doing main and side missions, destroying ships or competing in the Bounty Hunter's arena, you get specialists. They can give you bonusses to stuff like your ship's defensive skills, offensive skills, resource collection skills etc.  All specialists also have traits, which can increase the bonusses they give you by 33% if the requirements are met. Some examples are: Friendly (likes a team), Warrior (likes stronger systems), Miner (likes mining systems), Roid Rage (happier without men) etc. Specialists come in 5 grades/rarity levels: Common (50% drop chance), Uncommon (25% drop chance), Rare (12% drop chance), Elite (6% drop chance) and Godlike (3% drop chance). The rarer the specialist is, the better bonusses it will give you.  Your mothership (the Clockwork) can only hold so many specialists, so you must pick the best ones to keep. Luckily as your mothership gets upgraded, you can hold more and more specialists. If you don't like one of your specialists or don't have enough space for him on the Clockwork, simply just throw him/her out the airlock. But if you do so, you get a small amount of data, the amount probably depends on the specialist's rarity and rank (nobody could figure it out yet).  Whenever your ship's 'data level' levels up (after gathering enough data) the current active specialist(s) gains some experience points too, they start at Rookie, and can then rank up to Veteran and eventually Master. But as far as we know a specialist's rank does nothing to increase the bonusses he/she gives you.    FRIENDS: To form alliances (with the Civs and the UTA) you have to do missions, destroy the opposing faction's base or bribe them with goons. And if the Civs, UTA or the Bounty Hunters are your 'friends', they will sometimes join you in fights against the enemy you are fighting.    GAME CURRENCY: The main currency of this game is called 'Rez' with it you buy stuff at the Civs, UTA, pay your bounty at the Bounty Hunters and upgrade the Civilian and UTA starbases in the late game near the core of your galaxy. A good way to collect Rez is by mining asteroids. Mining Bases are always mining a HUGE asteroid so go pick some tiny bits of Rez up and return them to your beacon.  There is also your crew, your mothership can hold a certain amount of crewmembers, known as goons. Your ships take some of them on missions and pick new ones up during battles. Goons can also be sold at Mining bases for Rez, sold at Science stations for data or bought at Colony stations. When your ship levels up, the mothership clones a certain percentage of its max goons, and keeps them if there's enough space onboard. If a ship (both allied and enemy ships count) is destroyed, most of its goons and Rez is ejected. Ships belonging to the Civs, UTA or Bounty Hunters also let out some data and blackboxes on destruction.  Atleast the goons get into shuttles that fly away from the exploding ship, so they mostly survive the explosion. These escape pods can only hang around there in space for a certain amount of time before they automaticly eject the goon(s) inside that then die instantly. The escape pods can also be destroyed when weapons hit them.    Anyways, Space Pirates and Zombies 2 is finally out! So go have a look at both!  And also remember to look on the wiki and read some other reviews for the stuff I didn't explain in this review.  GLHF! (Good Luck and Have Fun!)  :-D
1244	1	a	Very good tower defence game and a cheap one too =)
1055	1	a	BLANK TIME KILLER.
4775	1	a	SPAZ is fun, suprisingly complex, and chock full of quirky, lightheared humor. Fans of games like Star Control 2, Privateer and Vega Strike will feel right at home, and even those who aren't should give it a shot if they're a fan action games with rpg elements.
3959	0	a	Diffinitly my least favorite total war out of them all. It is lacking some things that the other tittles bring forword. that being sead it is worth the money when it is on sale but i would deffinitly play the other tittles first
1784	1	a	Some good â¥â¥â¥â¥, definatly decent mods for it too if you get bored of murdering turks and â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s.   who knew, turns out p0laks is a slur
1858	1	a	I love this game. It introduced me to the Total War series and I am keen to try others. Both naval and land battles are very nice and fun to play. The game has many pros and cons, just like any other.   - Pros  -Large scale battles -Graphics aren't too outdated -The game is historically accurate -Great roleplay value -Great replay value -Large choice of nations to be in the campaign -Some great mods out there -Realistic  - Cons  -Sometimes stupid ai, the men sometimes just stand there while the enemy is in range, getting slaughtered -Not very friendly to new players of Total War -Micromanaging cities in the campaign is annoying  Overall, Empire: Total War is a great game and I am planning on buying Napoleon (because people say it's better).
1403	1	a	I invaded Russia.........And came back as a drunk ally, you explain it? this games magic 11/10
3422	1	a	awesome game try it out!

1617	1	a	Great game, great graphics, great histrical acuarce, great game. Good for people how like stratgy
3401	1	a	The best real time battles and a turn based 'Risk' style board game to boot. Both are engrossing and now they've implemented naval warfare too. Superlative stuff. The most impressive visuals with thousands of different unit types on the battlefields, this game pretty much has it all. An undeniable classic
3470	1	a	Its a good game!
1288	1	a	WHAT IF YOU COULD PLAY A GAME INSIDE AN POWERUP INSIDE A GAME INSIDE AN ENEMY INSIDE THE WALL INSIDE AN ENEMY.
1590	1	a	Played as Poland-Lithuania  Took Over the entirety of Europe  Taxed everybody like a crazed dictator and watched as my population plummet from starvation  Watched as my entire empire fall apart into many smaller nations  10/10 Would be Hitler again
551	1	a	This game's a blast. Overall, it's more of a 'management' type of game rather than ur basic hack-n-slash. Bonus are the little funny comments from the orcs whenever they start attacking. Even for an old game, it's still fun.
140	1	a	It was really fun to play, story is kind of good, graphics and gameplay are really nice.
2843	1	a	Total war empire is awesome, after i completed the campaign, i ate my girlfriends â¥â¥â¥ 10/10 would eat â¥â¥â¥ again
4152	1	a	Tbh I can only say this game is good for those who are new to Total War or Strategy games, and this is comeing from someone who grew up with this game and has over 1000 hours. I wish there was a sideways thumb tbh.   7/10, Medieval 2 and Shogun 2 are much better games
2023	1	a	This game is really fun and I recommend this game for people who like strategy.
1627	1	a	This is a good strategy game it has a lot of factions, good graphics, and awsoem gameplay
1264	1	a	Surprisingly deep. Literally.
3170	1	a	It's the best strategy game ever
4058	1	a	This is a fantastic game where you can change all of history. For instance in my game George Washington died before America actually became America
2597	1	a	Really nice combat emersion
4457	1	a	Play as Japanese. IMMEDIATELY wall yourself in. Get resources. Build your samurai army and ignore the outside world. Help no one, fight no one, only samurai army, keep out invaders Wait until you can no longer hold in your giant army or you've reached the utmost max samurai population with only having like 3 villagers. Unleash the samurai-pacolypse. Win.
3173	1	a	Very fun RTS, history can be drastically rewritten. Advised to everyone who likes feeling dominant on a battlefield.
1810	1	a	Empire: Total War nice
1671	1	a	Super game, HUGE campaign map, although it should have at least had 1 native American faction, but there is still more then enough to do. It has all the thing you would get in all of the earlier games.
1742	1	a	I recommend this game
4013	1	a	Amazing. Arguably the best game Total War have ever made! I've spent countles hours playing this game and still not bored.  Absolute 10/10
2858	0	a	I DDos my enemies to win sieges. Rice man I'm looking at you.

83	1	a	Fun game full of orcy destruction.
1970	0	a	No mods base game evaluation. DO NOT BUY. Overall score 3/10  This game plainly capitalizes on the success of previous releases. First time for me when CA seriously dropped the ball, but the more I play it the more I realize I should have had a refund.  Positives The game looks good when zoomed in. New game mechanics in advanced trade, multi warzones around the globe. Sea combat. New nations.  Negatives Feel: Maybe it is the period, but all European nations feel totally the same. Other than that nations have specific end buildings in capitals which helps with the immersion. Fights: 0/10 to AI quality. Pathfinding is abismal. You attack a unit infront of you, and your guys start running away (not retreating, or fleeing, running away from their goal.) Worse is, if you click right behind the enemy, they run towards the point without an issue. (Something is wrong with the attack script and it mainly happens in fort defense or attack.) Units CANNOT use walls. This was done in medieval, but here CA failed to do what they already had in the past. 1 guy is out of position running back and forth in the same place, so the entire unit just stands about without firing a single shot. And units CANNOT find a route off-on a wall. 1 bloke is stuck on the wall? Well the entire unit runs back to him, even if they almost reached their target already. Gates are used in a 1 man line for some reason they are as if they were a tight rope.  Your cannons play a very important role. BUT you MUST switch off auto aim. The canon crews execute themselves firing sideways, through the cannon next to them within the same crew, just to be scared of their own mental backwardness and flee in terror. They will also happily execute anyone on their side without further consideration.  If you want to put down money for such a game buy medieval or 'buy it off a friend' and fund modders who may fix this cluster mess. On that point, it is also harder to mod this game than Medieval, so you will find fewer overhauls and fixes.  Whioever scored this game higher... I do not know what you see in it, compared ot working games. If I put Medieval2 at 8/10 this cannot be above 5. It is bling and nicer, but years have passed, it MUST be nicer. If this was released by anyone else it would be a total flop without a single mention in any gaming press.
2260	0	a	I would rather drag my testicles though 70 miles of broken glass and rusty nails than play this game for another 15 minutes.
922	1	a	I love this game!  It has lots of levels which will supply you with hours of gameplay.   Every level you get a new spell or trap to use against orcs.  The game has very good graphics and dosn't lag on my $400 computer.  Over all I give it a 10 of 10.
2766	1	a	Oh, how sweet it is using canister shots against charging units and seeing their ranks get decimated in one blow. The lust for virtual blood and fake death makes me want to keep playing this game.
1272	0	a	This game has literally no point. No plot. Just the mechanic of shrinking into objects, with no real end to how small you can possibly get. And while that in itself is an awesome mechanic... it is rendered meaningless because there's just no plot. There's nothin'. It's literally just you going around shooting stuff and getting smaller.
4603	1	a	when I had this game I really loved it during the time that it was free, but when the free time ran out I was very dissapointed to find the I had to end up paying for it. Maybe another like one free day sale but hvae me not ever having to pay for it.  Besids all that, Its a really great game :D
1025	1	a	Fun but very challenging, or maybe I'm just bad at it.
2149	1	a	You can be the Swedish Empire and prevent the Russian Empire from happening Best game ever I rate it Carolus Rex/10
633	1	a	Tower defense based concept, and great if you're looking for instant action. Choose your character/weapons/traps; kill Orcs and keep them away from the rift!
2389	1	a	Amazing game. Perfect for lover of the total war series that want to immerse themselves in the patriotism of the birth of America but also as the first in the series to display guns as the common weaponry which involves totally new conflict and stratgies within the game. This proves a challange from the usual bull rushes of the prior games with iron clad warriors. The series of total war is amazing and this game easily stands out.
1948	1	a	One of the best Tw games in my opinion.
2446	1	a	this game.....IS WARFARE FOR GODS!!!!!!!!
3477	1	a	Every game of the Total War series captivates me for a long time. They're games for long nights. Nothing beats the satisfaction of placing your armies exactly right, not to kill all your enemies, but to achieve just the necessary strategic victories (or sometimes even defeats) to cut off enemy reinforcements, prevent operations or gain access to new regions. Empire is, in my opinion, the best product of the series - I like the imperialist era, but it's also on a higher technological level than Rome or Medieval.
4328	1	a	Grab a mod to unlock more factions and this game opens up in a completely new way. Your units may be inferior in some respects but the game is already easy enough, so welcome the challenge :)
3995	1	a	All the Total War series suffer from some AI pathfiding issues. However, that can be overlooked due to how addictive and fun they are to play.
3576	1	a	one of my very favorite games. love the style of strategy this offers.
1342	1	a	I believe Empire: Total War is the greatest Total War game of all, with a few qualifications. Of course the undeniable  best  TW game for me was Rome: Total War the First, which revolutionised the series and whatever genres you might want to identify in the wider title, a game which I have dumped huge amounts of hours into - amounts which grow even to this day by the occasional intense, weekend-long binge.  That opening paragraph may sound a bit contradictory - to begin with I call Empire the greatest TW title of all, then I immediately state that RTW is of course the  best , but I am trying to work on a distinction, here.  What I'm trying to say is that ETW was a perfect storm, if you will, a game which came at just the right time, featured just the right shift in scenery and era, brought in just the right technologies and got just the right feel of UI, interaction and general gameplay. I said before that some qualifiers exist and they do - the game is not a perfect TW title - but it gets certain things very, very right.  To elaborate then, I start with the game's position in the series. If memory serves (and really how wrong could it get) the game came after Medieval 2 and the Kingdoms expansion thereof and somewhat logically endured an advancement through the ages to the Age of Empire - but it also came at a perfect technological moment that allowed it to be a true quantum leap over it's direct predecessor in many ways. The upgrade in graphics, UI, gameplay (the introduction of smaller settlements and such on the map) and the addition of naval combat - not to mention the introduction of guns, en masse (more on the flaws of this system a bit later) - all went together to make this game feel many years ahead of the earlier titles in the series, and usher in the later era that we are now enjoying.  The Age of Empire just seems to perfectly lend itself to the Total War idea. Warefare by gun is just that bit more tactical, that bit more impactful and rhytmic. The battles - especially the open battles, far from fortresses and the select range of infuriating consequences to trying to breach walls - have real breadth for elaboration and intrigue...   My lasting memory of a battle in Empire: Total War occured when my Dutch army, emboldened by the easy capture of Norway from the Swedes, marched on their home province only to be met by all the soldiers that should have been guarding Norway on top of the standard garrison. My army consisted of a general's body guard, two run down groups of Cavalry, and three groups of riflemen - we were up against at least twice that number - and many of those units were perfectly respectable, dangerous foes with little militia riff-raff mixed in.  I had retreated from battle once after blindly commiting my army to a seige and pulling out - but that very turn the Swedes marched out to put me to the sword. Terrified, I put my troops to the rear of my deployment zone, on top of a shallow hill with a small but dense wooded forest crowning it, a vague crescent of extra-steep terrain, halfway from the crest and facing towards where the enemy would come from, and another scattering of trees further down the slope but quite a way off to a flank. I arranged two groups of cavalry - including my captain - in the dense forest, and a third group off to the opposite flank behind the scattered trees, while I lined my riflemen along the top rim of the steep section, as best as I could - the rim wasn't wide enough for one group, let alone three.  The battle commenced, and a broad force of enemies set off towards my small group of men. Hanging on by the seat of my pants, I noticed a group of cavalry making a run for the flank of my riflemen that was overlooked by the dense forest, and instantly shot out both of my hidden horse groups to intercept the charge, resulting in a very quick sortie between the advancing lines and my steady riflemen. The banner of the enemy horse group flashed, marvel of marvels, and I took that as a sign to instsantly wheel around and send my horsemen back to the dense forest. briefly pursued, the opposing horse group wheeled away at the line of trees under pot shots from my riflemen, but the battle had only just begun as I sent the horses right back out again more or less instantly to counter-charge into the flanks of a huge unit of footsoldiers who had engaged my left flank. In the mean time I had done more or less the same manouver with my other flanking horsemen, breaking into the flank of a group of riflemen before wheeling away for a second charge to counter the opposing captain as they attempted to augment their advancing rifle troops with a charge by the general's bodyguard. The battle would see-saw mightily as my riflemen gamely held the high ground, wheeling this way and that to stave off probing groups of gunners, while my ragged cavalry units darted this way and that, charging, extracting themselves and charging again, trying always to lock units in pincer movements and circle around behind them to force them to flee.  Miraculously, with only medium losses to ground troops and only about 50% losses to my cavalry units, I eventually forced the entirety of the enemy army to sound a hasty retreat, barring their captain! Noting that I only had one enemy left on the battlefield, I threw everything I could at him - all of my remaining horses charged his larger group from two sides,w hile up the middle charged the remainders of my three groups of riflemen, swords drawn, for the kill. A heroic victory was won that day, and with it my everlasting affection for this title.  Of course, as I have hinted at, this is the greatest and grandest of the TW games in my estimations - mirroring the pomp of the setting - but it is simply not the best because of a couple of isolated by serious flaws.  A) Battle Bugs Sadly, this game suffers from a few bugs in battle situations.   At one point while I was trying to mop up some pirates in the Leeward Islands my dutch riflemen refused to open fire on pirates crouching behind a wall, despite being well in range and themselves fired upon - a group of natives who I had sent creeping around behind and sprinting along the interior of the wall likewise refused to fight the 'dug in' enemy troops unless I simply told them to run through the enemy position, forcing them to automatically swing swords at them. Likewise a group of horsemen - I love me some flanking - who had circled around the  other  way had to sweep through and jump over the wall in question, heading for an empty space in the middle distance, in order to finally extricate the enemies from that wall and open them up to uninhibited, bug-free slaughter.  At another point, funnily enough also against pirates but this time at Port Royale, my troops of the Maratha Confederacy (I was trying to carve out some trade routes in the Caribbean) turned up with five groups of cannon and laid waste to the city walls - but not until I had lots two cannon and crew to invisible walls which forced them to walk in mid air, and this was just a prelude to the catastrophe that would be my attempt to enter into the town through the breaches in the walls - my riflemen just about struggled through in a completey buggy way, as did my elephants and such, but then half a platoon of elephants was cut down by the enemy captain, who despite being the last surviving member of his bodyguard was enjoying some kind of god mode bug as a result of being wedged between the invisible wall of the city gate and that of a section of ruined wall. I ultimately won that battle, but the unmitigated annoyance of trying to seige that settlement put my off seige battles for the remainder of my campaign - autoresolving any town that boasted fortifications.  B) Unplayable Factions I must end now, word limit, but the fact that you can only play the 'major factions' available at the start of the game kills my inner completionist.9/10
606	1	a	This game is simply a must-play for anyone even remotely interested in the tower defense genre. Orcs Must Die blends together strategic trap placement and 3rd person action seamlessly as it delivers a short but sweet experience that you will not soon forget.
14	1	a	If you've ever had the sadistic urge to kill en masse with a plethora of cruel, innovative, and brutal methods this is the game for you
1061	1	a	An absolute gem! Tower defence mixed with 3rd person shooter and rpg elements. The game is also hilarious, seemless, and the mechanics are fluid and easy to grasp, yet hard to master. There is more than one way to pass each level.   A friend bought me this game as a joke when it was on sale, and it ended up taking over our lives for a few months! Think about how much fun your $10 will buy you at a movie theater or a coffee shop... I guarantee this game will give you way more fun for less money.
616	1	a	Great tower defense style shooter.
3894	1	a	This TW game is good but not my favorite. Worth the $ on a sale and you get some real fun out of it if you enjoy history.
166	1	a	Tower defense and first person action blend incredibly well in this masterpiece. Aside from a hilarious cartoonish humor, the challenges are diffcult enough to keep you playing for dozens of hours. The music score is fantastic and the graphics are colorful. I suggest this game to anybody who enjoys tower defense games!
979	1	a	
1958	1	a	its a great strategy game better than any other game in the world! 
2066	1	a	The one of the best game in Total War series
1064	1	a	Traps, fast thinking, lot of fun, good humor. It's a must have in your library. Get it when it's on special at worst you won't regret it.
2096	1	a	What the â¥â¥â¥â¥ did you just â¥â¥â¥â¥ing say about me, you little â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥? Iâll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and Iâve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and Iâm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my â¥â¥â¥â¥ing words. You think you can get away with saying that â¥â¥â¥â¥ to me over the Internet? Think again, â¥â¥â¥â¥er. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. Youâre â¥â¥â¥â¥ing dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and thatâs just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable â¥â¥â¥ off the face of the continent, you little â¥â¥â¥â¥.

Youâre â¥â¥â¥â¥ing dead, kiddo.
1882	1	a	My 24 pounder frigate destroyed 6 Sotl. 10/10 completely accurate.
4439	1	a	A benchmark RTS development which still exceeds most games in it's genre. Almost 10 years since I began playing this game &amp; even longer for earlier franchise releases.
3241	1	a	My personal favorite of the Total War series. The controls are much better than prevoius Total War games. The campaign is very fun. My only complaint is the naval battles, which I loathe. I think it's just because I don't have a mind for the naval combat strategy.
2270	0	a	Not as fluid as Shogun 2 but still fun to play.
2873	1	a	You are here because Atilla and Rome 2 â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ you off
4243	1	a	Sea battles ruined this game. other than that, great game
3900	1	a	What an awesome game. Creative Assembly created a perfect view into the history the 18th century
3128	1	a	The time period is cool and the scale is massive! It sucks without DMUC 8.1 though.
1476	1	a	Showed the Russians the true meaning of winter, got destroyed... Next time, attack them in the winter instead of taking them skiing
164	1	a	I liked Dungeon Defenders a lot, but Orcs Must Die is even better. There is just something so incredibly satisfying to watch hordes of Orcs get blended in a maze of traps. From spikes on the ground or the walls, massive popup furnaces that churn walls of fire, milling barrels, rotating axes and the most epic weapon of them all in my opinion, the swinging mace. Or if you want to have some fun, the spring trap that makes them go airborn. You can either make them fly over the halls from one side to another using spring traps that face each other (it's just funny to do that :D ) or you simply throw them in lava or acid. Don't feel like blending the orcs? No problem, you can shoot them yourself with crossbow or use various other powers on them as well as place archers and knights that will fight for you. And when you think you exploited all the options, there are also powerup cards that give you special abilities like stronger player characteristics, stronger and faster traps or more powerful weapons. You invest some of the funds you have to buy traps into them and make yourself or the traps more efficient. Just awesome blend of FPS, lite RPG and tower defense. It's brilliant and i can't wait to play Orcs Must Die 2. Just have 3 more missions in the first game, but so far i'm totally in love with this game. Oh and unlike in the Dungeon Defenders, you can re-route their paths with barriers, so you can funnel them through one hallway to make your defending job easier, create a choking point where they all clutter together. It gives the game a proper tower defense feel and a lot more options to exploit on for maximum Orc blending power!  The game engine is also fantastic. From what i can tell they are using their own engine, but it's super fast, looks really good and has really nice character physics (really love the way how player's dress is affected by the movement) as well as physics that affect the orcs. And they achieved all this without the stupid PhysX. Thumbs up for that! And all this packed with quite well placed humor and player character making fun of himself and the orcs. And the way how developers presented the main character as the most stupid person in the world. It's just really funny game as a whole and love it for that.  And since there are so many different options to play through the maps with various approaches to horde control you can have countless hours of fun with the game. Highly recommended as i guarantee you countless hours of insane fun!
3527	1	a	I, Zombie, recommend this game. Never played it so far.
2340	1	a	As a fan of the Total War franchise, I find Empire: Total War my personal favourite. The naval battles really set it apart from the earlier titles. And the tech tree is massive! It requires you to either really focus on certain aspects or have multiple colleges for research. The three theatres of operation (Europe, America, and India) and multiple trade zones add to the challenge of maintaining your empire. You have many fronts to defend but so do your adversaries. Overall it's a very solid game.  Highlights of latest campaign playing as the Netherlands:  -Crushed the French by taking Paris by turn 20. Their overseas colonies all go rebel except one; welcome to the world stage the nation of Quebec.  -Conquered Madrid. Gave it to one of my new best friends: Portugal. Spain only exists on Sardinia now.  -Conquered all of Scandinavia. Gave it all to my other best friend: Hannover. They are a true world power now and have been taking it to Russia ever since giving them Finland.  -After stabbing former ally England in the back found that the Irish and Scottish were happy to have my rule but England itself rebelled four times before they consented to the yoke. They now love the Republic too.  -As a result of the conquest of England the United States rose in America. Started a war with me over the Carolinas. I captured the USS Consitution and it's now the flagship of my frigate fleet. Thanks for the unique unit, America! And the war doesn't go so good for them...  -The Maratha Confederacy foolishly declared war on me. Used a V.O.C. army to conquer all of their holdings in India. Kept a couple territories, gave the rest to the very friendly Mughal Empire. Hinduism is almost non-existent as a religion, replaced by Protestantism and Islam.
1005	1	a	BOSS this game is BOSS. 
2217	0	a	What could in theory have been a great game instead was just another game with terrible AI removing any reason to play it single player for anyone looking for an interesting experience. Atleast it's amusing to paint the map your colour as Indians. Take that Great Britain.
4462	1	a	Age of Empires 3 (AOE3) will always be my favourite RTS of all time. I have played this game since 2008 and on my disc copy (actually 3 disc copies lol) I would say I have played around 1500 hours or so total.   The Campaign : The campaign is not a hugely different playstyle from skirmish or multiplayer but it allows you to feel more like you're involved with the people and characters than usual which definitely makes the campaign worth playing through. Each expansion has a separate campaign and I remember them being highly entertaining and interesting each to their own. The campaigns also allow you to use civs not playable in any other game mode.   Map Editor : Not something I played around with too much, but it was fun to just create giant battles, or create your own scenarios and historical events.   Civilizations : The civilizations are really interesting. So interesting, that my interest in European, Native American, and Asian history are based from this game. I play this game as an excuse for studying for my history tests but I can't say that it helped with much more than trivia-like questions. Anyways, This game makes every civilization slightly different from each other (The War Chiefs and Asians are much different respectifully though) and every one is recognizable by not only building styles but troops as well. Each nation is given at least one troop that is unique to their civ. In the original there is 8 European nations (Britain, France, Spain, Portugal, Netherlands, Germany, Russia, Ottoman Empire) with War Chiefs, 3 Native American tribes were added (Iroquois, Sioux, Aztec) allowing 11 total playable nations, and finally with Asian Dynasties, 3 more were added (Japan, China, India), with a total of 14 playable civilizations . Apart from the 3 civs that are just a little bit better than the rest (You'll know soon enough), it is pretty balanced when playing online (IF playing with someone with similar experience).   Multiplayer : AOE3 was slowly getting weaker with age a few years back but with the game being more widely sold on steam, I feel the community has a chance to bounce back. Usually when I go on, there are anywehre from 600 - 1000 people on at a time. This doesn't count the community that play on places like GameRanger and other programs like it. Don't get discouraged by people baiting new players into their games when they are veteran players. Host a game and name it something welcoming new players, read the ranks of the people who join, to make sure the game will be fair and welcoming to you if you are new. Or join another low ranked players game or grab a buddy or two and practice between you all. I would recommend being able to beat Hard or Expert computers before playing online, but of course, it is your choice. Multiplayer is the best place to play, practice, and have a competitive and some-what stressful game of AOE3. :)   Graphics : Honestly, in my opinion, the graphics are spectacular for their time and do not look anywhere near 'bad' even in today's time. Of course they aren't great for today's standards but they aren't awful enough to turn you away. I actually find them quite nice and I am more than satisfied watching the ships travel the oceans, or seeing the parrots flying through the rainforests. The loading screens are really nice too, all 3 games have different styles. For example in Asian Dynasties there is one loading screen with the Indian Emperor riding on an elephant with the troops behind them. Or the Japanese loading screen with the beautiful Torii Gates. In War Chiefs, one screen is the Aztec emperor on top of a temple with his arms up with the people looking up to him from the ground. This game sparks not only interest, but imagination, its amazing!   Soundtrack : The soundtrack is phenominal! I absolutely love the theme song of each game and I find myself testing my opera skills most times I play this game. The music is great, intense, and is fitting to the epic introduction to the game or the conclusion to the massive multiplayer game you just finished.   Opening : The opening to each expansion has a really cool video based on the game. The War Chiefs has the European explorers searching the forest and them being ambushed by the Native troops. It's epic, and amazing to watch from time to time before jumping into the game! I recommend watching all 3 intros so I'll let you watch to find out what they're like!   Extra Features : Unlike previous installments to the franchise (AOE1, AOE2, Age of Mythology), AOE3 introduces cards, card decks, city levels, city customization, explorer naming, and city naming. Cards can be purchased by leveling up. One level is one card unlock point. A deck can have I think 21 cards to start, and with every ten level ups, can have an extra card in the deck. Cities level up by playing with them, and EXP is given for every building or troop made, or enemy building or troop destroyed. Cities can be customized by upgrading the buildings, such as France's Notre Dam by changing colours, adding features, etc. A minor touch but still interesting enough to have your own sort of style with leading a nation in the game. Your explorer can be named so you can make yourself, a friend, or family member be the greatest European explorer, Native American War Chief, Japanese Shogun, Indian Brahmin, or Chinese Master that has ever existed. The same goes for cities, you can name them the small rural town you live in, or your country's capital city and make it the most advanced city in the world! All theses extra features expand upon the replayability and fun that you can have with AOE3.   Note, AOE3 - The Asian Dynasties expansion was the latest released and updated. All Civs can be played on this expansion and the majority of the people play on this one. I suggest only playing the original AOE3 and War Chiefs when playing with campaign, or really dislike playing with or against the Asian Civs as they cannot be played in the others.  Also, check out Age of Mythology Extended Edition (AOM) on steam if you like this game, or if you're into Greek, Egyptian, Norse mythology. I prefer AOE3 myself, but AOM is my second favourite in the series. Personally, I would wait until this game, and/or AOM, go on sale to buy them but I still feel they are worth the cost. Like I said at the top, I have 3 disc copies of AOE3 that all work (long story) and also disc copy of AOM. These games ARE worth it.  All in all, I want to see AOE3 bounce back strong. If you're new looking for help, a partner to play with, or want to join a clan who are mostly active, just message me on steam and I hope to see you on the battlefield soon!   
211	1	a	Best TPP defence/shooter game, a must-have!
4919	1	a	Lots of fun exploring the galaxy, upgrading your ships and of course, fighting off zombies. Decent story. Just a well-made game with no glaring flaws.
1756	1	a	The rustics were so inept, it nearly took the honor out of victory  nearly.
5010	1	a	Not close enough to Escape Velocity Nova, but still pretty good.
3337	1	a	Empirically pretty good. While not the black sheep of the series, this edition did make some total changes to the war mechanics.
1424	1	a	Easily one of the best games I have on steam. Easy to learn controls mixed with an awesome and detailed campaign and immersive multiplayer and battles
1646	1	a	One of my all time favorite games, besides Battlefield 2. I've been playing this since it came out, took a break, but now back at it. Just can't get enough. Highly recommend.
3399	1	a	If you are into conquering the world, then this is for you... although it may be a little bit old now :p
1777	1	a	Britain best â¥â¥â¥â¥er Merica â¥â¥â¥â¥er Frunch and â¥â¥â¥â¥ OTTO
3490	1	a	Excellent game, I love replaying it with a different faction over time. DarthMode also modded the game greatly. I know im vintage
5110	1	a	Addictive and easily moddable  7.6/10
1043	1	a	pretty good.
4037	1	a	This is a very solid game for the price and is basically a large scale Napoleon : Total War which is also one of my favorites. It is pretty good if you enjoy other Total War games or just turn-based games in general.
2668	1	a	Not too bad as a game, I just could not get myself to conquer the whole map yet. Yes, fire by rank, when your line infantry obliterate the enemy lines using this firing method, its glorious!   There are many things that annoy me in this game (like diplomacy) but the worst thing I can think of is the way soldiers fight. No matter how many men are involved in combat there are only 1v1 fights (duels) so no backstabbing or whatever.
1124	1	a	A hidden gem on Steam. Definitely worth the 4 bucks I paid to play it.
663	1	a	What games used to be. Simple in concept, fun to play and very addictive. The orcs must die!!! Bit of strategy with FPS action a great stress reliever. Don't take it too seriously and you'll love it.   The easy levels are just that easy, the harder ones are much much harder and will make you work for it.   Never knew there were so many way's to kill orcs.
4897	1	a	SPAZ is a very fun game. Got it with a $2 sale on Steam and at around 180 hrs of play, def a great value. I have played the season versions, and that gives a bit of replay value. Looking forward to SPAZ2 soon. Would reccomend this as a great time dump game.
4441	1	a	Yeah... I guess it's pretty decent.
3216	1	a	Great game for the year it came out, historical buffs will love the refrences in the DLC to units like the 'Deaths Head Hussars.'
2953	1	a	Quite possibly the best Total War of the recent era. A great variety in units across multiple factions and a technology tree that rewards players for their efforts. Few games can match the thrill of a regiment of artillery unloading unrelenting volleys of devastation upon enemy ranks as they close in, only to be met by waves of bullets from disiplined infantry cutting them down as they reach your lines. The Naval combat can be excillerating if not a bit difficult to master, however the graphics and combat certainly make up for it  However the game certainly has some frustrating drawbacks that seem to be a step backwards from previous games. The ability to remove your faction leader has been made tedious by having to incite revolts in your capitals. The ability to set individual taxes for certain countries has been streamlined to an overall tax slider for your whole economy. A change in difficulty simply effects how much the computer cheats rather than effecting the effeciency of the AI.  Nevertheless, the game is a solid investment and I would certainly recommend purchasing it during a sale with its few DLC unit packs.
1772	1	a	If you are a fan of the TW series this will be a good adition to your library.
3359	1	a	Being a total war fan i own every one and if im honest this was not my fav one of them all.   It become more about who had the bigger guns and i feel this takes away the magic that is Total War.  Even with this i still enjoyed my time playing this the once through and the sea battles have to be admired but unlike the other games they have produced, It only got the one play through
2886	1	a	I've been a Total War fan ever since I picked up a copy of Medieval I (which seems like a million years ago). Empire is a very worthy addition to the Total War family - it's great fun.
736	1	a	Awesome Defense - type game. It has lots of replayality.
4265	1	a	I played almost all the game in the Total war Series and for me this is the best one. 18th century is one of my favorite timeline in history it is perfect for a total war game. plus the campaign map is Massive Spanning to 3 different Theater Americas, Europe and some parts of asia I hope the next game will feature the whole world Im really looking forward for Empire: Total war 2
1387	1	a	One moment you're strugling to fight off the british as try to gain America it's independence. Next moment you're Invading India to conquer the last bit of land not flying the Stars and Stripes.  Solid 8/10 would freadom the world again.
752	1	a	Stop hesitating and start building .
4343	1	a	I have 400 hours on this game and I still want to put on more. My favorite part is when you have to fight Venice over and over again because you can't take that territory and suddenly their one region fields 15k troops but not before all you provinces revolt.
4221	1	a	i m sorry,but this game even with the darthmod lacks a lot of things,there are almost no setlements on the map,a barren wasteland really,in darthmod the auto resolve is just insane,i lost 900 men once attacking 200 depleted soldiers,naval auto resolve is also broken,naval battles in darthmod are worse than the vanilla,surprisingly,they are slow and the hull strenght is the only stat that matters,nevermind guns,ammo types or anything else.However the vanilla left us with the maps that are so boooriiiing...  let s talk about the road to independence....uhhhh...whre do i even start?u have 2 historical carachters,george,paul revere(who s a gentleman) annnd that s it...the brits have william howe which u ll probably kill within the first turn....but then everything goes to â¥â¥â¥â¥...regiments of grenadiers,light infantry,hessians,indians all of it will come down on u,which is so â¥â¥â¥â¥ing unfair i can t even explain it,like maybe in vanilla it s ok,but in darthmod u reeeally have to play every â¥â¥â¥â¥ing battle so that u don t lose all ur troops.i searched in the tech tree for a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing missile cav cause they were kinda popular really,and there weren t any except the sheldon and light dragoons which are quite high in the tier,so u ll be done with the campaign by that time....  england should have some objectives of it s own which will get them some transports,ships and troops rather than recuiting all those troops from the territories they control,maybe some loyalist company but they re not in the game,and surprisingly they are not in darthmod either,i m not even american and i m still complaining about this...  i like this game but there are a lot of things that suck about it,vanilla and darthmod
1060	1	a	You can kill Orcs, IGN 9/10
545	1	a	I know it's not a new game, but like way to many games these days, the inability to customize you input settings really limit the playability...  Fortunately I got this as a part of a humble bundle or I would have been rather upset with it... At the very least include a way to set inverse mouse in the menu..
5090	1	a	Ever enjoyed Star Control 2? Space Rangers 2? Well then here is SPAZ. Created by a group disappointed by the lack of such games on the market today.  For a game that only cost $15, and succesfully pulled me away from Deus Ex: Human Revolution - get it!
4036	1	a	dont be fooled by the hours played on this account. i had over 2k hours on my old pc before i had actual internet.  this game i cant put into words how â¥â¥â¥â¥ing much i love it. buy it, play it, love it unconditionally forever.
3309	1	a	I've played all the Total War games, except the latest one Rome 2. In my opinion Empire is the best one in the series. Really very well done.
3790	1	a	First off GREAT GAME. Secondly.... let me tell ya a lil sumthin... Usually when you play the Maratha Confederacy will take out the Mughal Empire in India fairly quickly.. However in my latest campaign, i was Prussia and watched in horror as the game did so many unexpected things.. Austria moved far more west than it normally does and took out France really early. Bavaria moved in and took out Hannover and the United Provinces.. I go to look at what is going on in India and Maratha has expanded about 3-4 more cities into the Mughal Empire. about 10 turns later i look and the Mughal pushed them back to the original two they start with. and about 20 turns after that, the Mughal Empire has completely killed the Maratha Confederacy, and took over all of the middle east and is now taking on the Ottoman Empire and kicking â¥â¥â¥. Oh and by now i took over Sweden, Denmark, Polish-Lithuania, Courland, and Russia. Bavaria is still a decent sized Empire and Austria lost its hold on Paris and France is back in the game... the United Provinces got back in but was shortly taken back out by Bavaria.... Definitely surprising. Playability is GREAT!
1140	1	a	Do you like killing orcs? what about gnolls, ogres and kobolds? what about using traps to cut them, pinch, burn, slice, throw, and crush them, all that sprinkled with some magic spells; kill orcs, be creative doing it, have fun.
1895	1	a	IT IS AWSOME
921	1	a	fun good game... not worth 15 bucks but not so bad for 5-10
1120	1	a	Got this game in the sale, would have been worth it full price though.   Simple and fun.
1097	1	a	An educational game for the entire family.
3211	1	a	Old ish game still fun kick assbuy!  9.5/10
3242	1	a	
4614	1	a	This game delivers on what it says, Zombies - check, pirates - check, space - check. Most honest game this year.
4307	1	a	why the â¥â¥â¥â¥ is it that when i exempt a region from taxes they still start a rebelion and why do some of the empires declare war on me for no god damn region when we were allies and friendly for up to 6 ingame years
2984	1	a	awsome strategy game. would recommend.
1834	1	a	Two words: Darth Mod
3157	1	a	One of the best total wars in the series. The map is huge, graphics amazing, its not glitchy, and the battles arnt bad. All around a great game. Get the expasion pacts they add to the game. If your looking for a total war get this one its bettert than shogun 2, and works better than rome2
1717	1	a	This stuff is good man
2376	1	a	Full of rank'n'file goodness 
3777	1	a	I will admit, when I first bought this game I was very iffy about it, but it introduced me to my highest played series on steam. Empire: was probably the best installment this far for me, holding above 500hours of play time. To put that in perspective, when I bought it, the game was about 30$. That's about 17 hours per dollar paid, and I still launch it up from time to time.  From suicidal victories to overwhelming defeats, the game has never failed to give me a good time. I will however recommend you never use the auto-resolve button, as scenarios that you can entirely murder your opponent, often turn into a percent of your troops lost needlessly.  The game gives you control of what you want, in the campaign, more in depth players can control building, taxes, revolts etc. Less in-depth players can just move around the map and fight wars, making it a near perfect fit for everyone.  10/10 Money well spent
523	1	a	Few games are tight and cohesive as OMD. The presentation is perfectly suited to the game mechanics.
228	1	a	I love this game, it's a beautiful tower defense game, when i bought it, i played it till the end. 6 hours of game in a row 
856	1	a	For me, more outright fun than Sanctum or Dungeon Defenders. Dungeon Defenders suffers from a Sisyphean feeling of level and item grinding common to MMO's, and Sanctum feels too prescriptive in what approach you need to take to win like more traditional tower defense games. Orcs Must Die avoids this rewarding you with a new toy on each level, and only requiring grinding to beat highscores. Gaining access to new combinations, and highscore tracking, keeps replaying earlier levels interesting.
3492	1	a	Absolutely fantastic game. I played campaigns over and over again because of how great this game is.
3293	1	a	Those crazy Brits. :) 11/10.
4877	1	a	It's a really good game for the price. It will take you a ton of hours to finish the game and the mechanics are really cool. The bad part is that the game requires lots of grinding some times and this is when the game might get boring, still you can change your spaceships hulls and customize their parts so its not that boring.
173	1	a	When I was young, I played a lot of tower defence games in Warcraft 3. But Orcs must die sets a new level in this genre. Combining a 3rd person action game with tower defence, it created the ultimate action survival game. Set in a fictional fantasy universe, you have to defend humanity against hordes of orcs from another dimension. For that, they built big fortress' around the portals, you have to defend.  For that, you not only have weapons and spells, but a big arsenal of traps and mechanical defend systems, from ordinary spike traps to big swinging clubs, burning pits and big brutal mechanical grinders. Every level is made of one or several floors with one or several directions the enemys can spawn. You have to defend the rifts to the normal world, so the orcs dont conquer it.  Using the right collection of traps, wisly using your abilitys and being a tactical genius desides about victory and defeat. The game doesnt take you lightly. With the first levels being easily understandable and mostly fast to solve, some maps are difficult beyond everything encountered before. Some maps need tricks you have to find out all by yourself, some just need you to be fast like sonic, defending two rifts at once.  Having a small storyline, mostly living from comedy, the campaign is really fun to play. After one playthrough you unlock another difficulty, that is a serious challenge (and was a real pain for me).  It isnt a real game for casual players, but a good game, for tacticans, that not only want to think but slay their way through their enemys.
1130	1	a	This game is not a casual game. OMD is deceptively challenging and ramps in difficulty pretty quickly in only a few levels; it's nothing rage inducing unless you are a perfectionist seeking a perfect skull score on each level (compare it to getting full stars in Angry Birds).   At it's core it's an ultra-competitive score attack arcade game and is best played as a marathon rather than in short bursts as you'll have time to warm up and eventually play at your best.   Pros: - Smooth gameplay - No spoonfeeding - Great balance between budgetting, planning, setting up traps and commencing the action - Replay value  Cons: The game has a number of annoyances but nothing worthy of including in this review. Simply put they could have tweaked certain things a bit more for my taste.  Note: If you don't have a strong fan for your PC be wary of overheating.
4526	1	a	Very enjoyable game with decent replay value.
951	1	a	The main character looks like a cross between Wreck-It Ralph and Jack Black  10/10
3220	0	a	Maybe this is what it feels like to not be into 4X games and try to play one?  There might be a group of people who're into slow gameplay, clumsy controls and limited variation in play, but they're not me.
5056	1	a	My Let's Play of SPAZ:  https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0Pap9speyQl6P2FM1yy3WnPAY62gkrkS   This game is very fun and challenging, but I do feel the enemy runs away WAY TOO MUCH, most of this game is spent chasing enemies as they run away... it can be mighty annoying...  7.5/10
3137	1	a	It won't let you leave your game. You should think twice before buying this game cause you will be glued to your seat and you will be playing this game for long long hours..
566	1	a	You like orcs? Plenty of them! You hate orcs? What are you waiting for, slaughter them!
2344	1	a	Awesome game sega. Makes you go back to the 18 century and command armys of the old days.
1634	1	a	This edition of the Total War series is a very fun game. Empire has come a very long way since its more than disastrous release (not as bad as Rome 2). The game has a very fun campaign experience, good factions, and very good units at your disposal. The battles are always a good time, except when a AI unit gets glitched out, or when they, or even sometimes your units have a hard time trying to find a pathway to where you want them to go. The DLC's are very nice to have, but if you aren't interested in spending money to be using units like the US Marines, or Legion of The United States, or you are not interested in playing as the Native Americans in the campaign then the DLC's may not be for you. All in all, the game is a 8/10 for being a fun RTS, having a great campaign map, as well as having great units and factions, but The Dumb AI can really hurt the game for me, or even other players like yourself. 
4924	1	a	This game was really fun and addictive, I really find myself always coming back to it when I'm in the mood for a space game and put on my muse music
4337	1	a	Epic game! 9/11 harambe would be proud, and look at my hours on record.
1679	1	a	Pretty damn mint game. This is only so I get the Badge
3659	1	a	this game is fun i have no prob with it
1077	1	a	'I could do this all day!' says the hero and it's true!
4415	1	a	Great game love it enough said
3584	1	a	'Good sir!! Thy revolution hath started!! Gather yer finest ships and blockade the port!!' - The new additions to the TW series. How can't this 17-18th century rts game satisfy you for a decade (more than an average game)? It's got lovely soundtracks, knowledgeable and admirable quotes, in-game naval fights, a wide variaty of units, trade theaters, decentralized cities, a timetable of historic events, more countries and different types of goverment. With this game, you can forge your own empire, and alter history to your liking!! READY........... FIRE!!!
4301	0	a	Trash, Units get stuck sit around don't fire. Terrible Campaign alliances don't matter they betray you or just do nothing when you get attacked. Building doesnt have any appeal just feels super sloppy very disappointed after playing rome total war 1. War really wanting to enjoy this time period hope in the future they do another and do it right.
2118	1	a	The campaign is excellent, but the battles are worse because of a bad AI
2031	1	a	pls implement darthmod for mac and make darthmod offical
4686	1	a	Incredible game, tons of fun. It's a pretty expansive space/shooter/explorer game with a few odd twists. Tons of stuff to do and explore and the sound effects are great. I've yet to beat this but it's been great game.
2903	0	a	Nope. Can rarely get into it to play. Whatever happened to click and play. Absolute rubbish. I'll be uninstalling Steam and the Game.
2658	1	a	Fun game that I have sunk perhaps too many hours into it.  Pros: Numerous special units for every nation. Good looking visuals, from musket smoke to heat distortions. Quick battles are a fun way to attempt at recreating your own 18th century historical battles. AI can sometimes be very challenging.  Cons: Sound effects are somewhat underwhelming for the vanilla game. Naval battles can be frusturatingly slow and tedious. AI can often times be incredibly stupid. (Sitting imobile outside of your fort for the entire 60 minutes as you wait for time to run out.) Melee attacks seem somewhat broken. I had an entire regiment of line infantry reduced by nearly half strenght by 1 enemy unit simply because melee only supports 1 v 1. So while 1 infantry is fighting another, all other infantry of that regiment stand by watching like movie henchmen.  All in all a fun game by itself, but I'd recommend downloading Darthmod to improve the visuals and add even more units.
2673	1	a	great game. Really Really great with dlc
1582	1	a	Basically an awsome game, with interesting twerks and (through mods) immense replayability, with the cons of god-awful graphics and the burden of being utterly abandoned by the developers.  I give it a strong 6/10 just because of the loyal community
4615	1	a	Very fun game with a unique sense of humor, something one only gets from indie developers. Well worth the price (its dirt cheap!).  
2101	1	a	A great fun game to sit back and relax with.
3497	1	a	This game is very fun. I have put so much time into this game and I love every second of it. If you love strategy games you'll LOVE this game.
5109	1	a	Get this game.
1944	1	a	(sorry for any spelling errors)   I LOVE THIS GAME so much it is very fun and VERy reallistic i have played this for a while and love it this game is very fun from another of the total war series and they have done so well on this and i highly recomend this game to people who love the total war series and strategy games!
724	1	a	Who could find the killing of orcs en masse dissatisfying!? Not me, thatâs for sure. Thatâs why I liked this game very much. You will like it very much too.
1432	1	a	This game is real good if you install DarthMod Empire.
1588	1	a	If you like 18th century politics,large scale RTS battles and obliterating France,this is the game for you!
362	1	a	Great game - marries tower defence and third person shooter mechanics in a nice, polished package.   Recommended!
2970	1	a	so diappointed 174 turns 47 hrs in on United provinces and the game wont quit crashing,,,, all it keeps asking is do i want a refund... no I want my game to work...
4134	1	a	Where to start? I am a huge fan of the Total War series, and this is the most played game in my library, so needless to say: I LOVE IT! The historical setting, grand campaigns streching across 3 continents, and unique strategies and tactics for each faction give this game so much personality. The moments leading up to a large engagement are tense as you jocky for ideal firing lines and artilery positions. As battles progress and stakes get higher, finding clever tricks to make the enemy turn tail and run is incredibly satisfying and the feeling of total victory when a hated foe is finally swept from the map is sublime.  Take control of major powers of the 18th century, lead armies in epic yet realistic, real-time battles. Interact with other nations on a massive set-piece, turn based grand campaign map by waging war, trading, competing in a technological arms race.  Pros: -Great mix of real-time and turn-based strategy -Fight epic battles and take command as a general. -Rewrite history however you like (India invades Mexico? YOU BET!) Cons: -WILL EAT AWAY AT YOUR LIFE!
1841	1	a	Buy this game. Seriously... Have spent hours enjoying this game, and it never gets old.
2052	1	a	top
3025	1	a	play this legendary game if you dont have it. its only $14.99
1781	1	a	Dominate the high seas or as a revolutionary government bring Empires to its knees, or fight for control of North America and the European colonies 10/10.
3486	1	a	Steam is the gayest â¥â¥â¥â¥ing parasitic merchant scum i've ever had the displeasure of encountering.
3070	1	a	The mighty Maratha Confederacy stretches from India to Britain to Canada, built upon the corpses of thousands of Bargir line infantrymen, dead cuz the AI's dumb but so am I. I just send them into meatgrinder bayonette fights while I sit on an elephant 500 yards behind the carnage and listening to the Podquisition applauding my own tactical genius!
1851	1	a	This game is a great game. It will never get 'too old'! Its very uniqe. You can play all from epic naval battles, to nice land battles. I recommend this game if you like Age of Empires and other games like that. If you wan't pay the current price, maby it will be on sale on Steams SummerSale.   6/6 stars from here. ******. 
4506	1	a	Customization and privateering. Looking forward to SPAZ 2
367	1	a	A fun game with a variety of interesting ways to make those orcs die.
2411	1	a	I purchased this game before being deployed to Iraq in 2010 and quickly became addicted. Out of all of the Total War games this one is by far my favorite. This is somewhat obvious from over 430 hours logged. I have followed the Total War franchise since its beginning by playing the original Shogun and I have played at least partially through most of the games.  In order to outline why this is my favorite here is a brief list.  1. The variety of countries to play 2. The feel of the battles (cannon fire is very satisfying) 3. The balance between managing resources and armies in the campaigns  The only downside for me that exists with the game is its tendency to crash. While it wasn't as bad for me as for other people it did happen once or so per 10 game startups and in the middle of a battle every once in a while. Other than that, it is a very satisfying and fun game that I still play occasionally.
4790	1	a	SPAZ is a pretty awesome game and is best described as a mix of arcade action mixed with roleplay elements, a genre that seems to be dead these days sadly. It is very enjoyable to cruise around and upgrade your stuff, the small storyline holds everything together, and for the rest you have precodurally generated galaxies which gives the game a welcome randomized feel.  Can't see a reason why anyone shouldn't like this game.
1593	1	a	great great great.. the trade theatres brings an amazing new level to the game that makes having a navy fleet or two worth having for other than just defending your shore or ports.. but keep up with ever advancing naval technologies or your trade theatre claims may become contested rather quick.
1479	1	a	This game remains one of my favorites despite being so old. It's one of those classics that sticks out and ages really well.
1567	1	a	It make good play game many hour having funs.
463	1	a	There are sooo many ways you can complete the levels, I'm almost done finishing the game on hardest difficulty. Its lots of fun and i recommend it to everyone who likes a challenge but doesn't want days and days of content before finishing the game.
1482	1	a	This is a brilliant game which combines strategy and fighting
2283	1	a	))
2803	1	a	Nothing is better than making a peace treaty with a enemy country, stocking back up on money and soldiers, and then betraying the peace treaty again when you are 10 times stronger.  10/10 would betray again.  Srsly tho seeing your front lines fire the first time and already making a enemy line flee away in terror is a great feeling. Amazing game would reccomend.
288	1	a	Very fun 3rd person tower defense game - plays out a lot like team fortress 2's MvM mode without the co-op. Just enough variation in the levels to keep it interesting and the option for nightmare mode with all of the unlocked upgrades boosts its replayability. Expect about 10 hours for the first run through and if you're a perfectionist, ample more after that on nightmare mode trying to obtain 5 skulls. Definitely recommended, especially since it can be founds cheap.
4128	0	a	Can't even set my troops to run. They just do whatever they like. Just buy fall of the samurai and be happy.
4755	1	a	Never thought a Indie-Game for about 5â¬ could cost me more than 100 hours
1892	1	a	I rewrite my review since I forgot to say the technical parts of the game.   Yeah Empire TW is buggy and glitchy game, but at least a better than Rome 2. but still, This game make me can't stop to continue turn after turn in the campaign. This game gave best expirience after you get your goal. The odd statisfying aftertaste. Especially if you have Warpath campaign, that give you more whole new expirience but addiction if you get used to and find your way how to fight. And if you have time on battle, spent some to zoom into soldiers and hear the voices   And Multi Player, sadly almost no player now. But if there's a player this game is nice. sometimes you can win bcoz correct using of one unit. all about timing.   Choose Prussia, First time I get Loyal Ally.   God Bless Hannover
1876	1	a	Awesome Game you can easyly Squish those fools
4420	1	a	Ended too soon.
942	1	a	This â¥â¥â¥â¥ is just some GOOD CLEAN FUN. Must play!  Seriously, great game. Guess you could say it's RPG trap defense. Third person shooter, puzzle, whatev. Damn good gameplay. Smooth as a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s â¥â¥â¥. The sequel is even better!  10 / 12
2635	0	a	Terrible AI always ends up ruining these games for me
675	1	a	When i first played Orcs Must Die i thought what is with all the hype. Recently i've been playing more and more of it, and finally understanding what all the hype is about. Great game for relaxing and just killing things. Turn on some music, and have a great time killing orcs.
894	1	a	This game is great to play when you want to have a quick fun. Each party does not last more than 20 minutes, so you can play it every now and then.   The gameplay is easy to grasp and the challenge is well balanced so you get the incentive to start over some levels to get all the points.  I'm going for 100% achievements for this game, because it makes me feel like I can do it.  I will do it at my pace, one play at a time, every now and then.  And when I'm done with it, I'll download the sequel to keep the fun going.  That makes for a fun game, that I recommend.
4121	1	a	a good total war game , great for any veterains of the series or if you just want to command large armys . A few noticable problems being that your forces when commanded often dont do anything and even when moving it feels sluggish and almost like your moving in slowmotion but this is fixed by the fastforward button althou this causes some minor lag . these are to me the most noticable problems but overall will not effect your game experience. GO BUY THIS GAME M8
4048	1	a	Played it a bit. Isnt that bad.
4212	1	a	Great game still playin after all these years.
3799	1	a	cool game but customer service never got back to me about my problem.
1654	1	a	A VERY detailed game, much like risk.  Takes a long time to play through a game.  But it would take a long time to seige, not only a country,or contenant, but the world. Schools, scholars, assassins, captains are a 'detail' to the game that allows users and cpus to give their training, navy, or offense that little extra boost.   I found most of my time trying to figure out ways to maximize income. Not the most exciting part of the game.  This game makes the users truley in command of the terrirory, armies and navies that you own. There is a battle feature that fights for you if you find your massive force against an army or navy the size of a bug. Another feature this game has is not only the ability to hire a number of different units, but build fortresses and defend in buildings.  One of my favourite parts of this game is how you can disperse your army during battle. You can set their formation to be a square, or a rectangularish shape, depending your situation in game. Watching each and every person in a unit fight in this game is Very entertaining. Especially if you are having a massive amount of cavailary run stright into militia.  Good game. I can only play so much of it though.
4220	1	a	Have been a fan of the Total War franchise and this game is another of the great games in the series. Reliving historic scenarios and even changing history playing the factions.  This is a must have for players who love turn-based games!
4584	1	a	A surprisingly deep game. Combat and customization remind me of Mechwarrior; economics and missions are similar to that of Freelancer; the story itself is reminscent of Homeworld and other space sims. Well worth the price, even if it was in a bundle.
2733	1	a	if this game was a alien and it was a general controlling aliens it would be out of this world!. well this game isnt about aliens at all but its still out of this world awesome.
3508	1	a	
2793	0	a	Another Total War... /yawn.
3906	1	a	very good game and a good buy
3631	1	a	I recommend it.
1614	1	a	Great Game, Plenty of Mod Capability, Fun, and Epic. Perfect to see if you want to know if you have the Military Cunning to Conquer the Globe in under a Century with 18th Century Technology.
2992	1	a	Best Total War game to date!
483	1	a	First off: Play this, even if its just the demo; don't be fooled by how easy the demo is --this game gets fairly difficult pretty quickly. And when you finish the story mode, you unlock Nightmare Mode, which involves hard versions of every level with more, tougher enemies, next-to-no downtime between waves, and no breather 'Unleash the Horde!' events. Great art, fantastic gameplay, witty dialogue. Completely worth its low price point.
944	1	a	Great game, highly recommended!
2533	1	a	119 total hours played thus far.. I play this game a lot and i love it..!!!
4893	1	a	AFAIR is the first game of its kind I playd. AFAIK it wont be the last.
2266	0	a	Useless game you should just buy medieval 2 total war as it is far better in almost every way- bar the graphics.
4380	1	a	*Starts the American Independence Campaign* First battle with George Washington in 1750's I destroy the enemy force but they have one cannon unit left. I charge everyone head on at cannon unit, cannon manages to fire once. Cannon ball directly hits George Washington killing him 20 years before American revolution. 10/10 would destroy Americas hopes before revolution again.
4431	1	a	Just finished a Short Campaign after not touching this game for several years..  Like back then I couldn't stop playing till 5 am even with a workday the same morning. It's pure gold!
20	1	a	Good meat!
4896	1	a	Nice game!
1299	1	a	The simplified interface elements, great campaign, and much-improved map and information screens make this the most accessible Total War yet, and a great place for those unfamiliar with the series to get started.Empire: Total War is a masterful combination of all the things that I love about strategy games -- a great setting, a first-rate presentation, tactics that reward maneuver, and a strategic layer that requires flexibility in your plans...Simply put, if you're a fan of strategy games, this is one game you must have in your collection.Empire: Total War is breathtaking in its scope, enthralling in its detail, and staggering in its execution. Despite one or two minor flaws, it should be considered one of the very best strategy titles available on any platform.Looking for errors in this game is pretty hard, but the sluggish controls and small AI quirks prevent Empire: Total War from scoring perfect. Still, itâs a feast for every strategist.This is one of the most sophisticated, entertaining, and historically accurate strategy games ever made.
2151	1	a	'Shoot straight ya â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s!' That saying pretty much summarizes the whole style of warfare which is seen in this astonishing game.This is one of CA more ambitious title for its time going for the traditional melee combat to 'modern warfare'  In this game you can choose between multiple factions including of course the more traditional one such as the French or British.However,less common factions which unique warfare tactics are also available like the Ottomans for example with its fearsome sword bearing janissaries or the Marathas deploying its heavy cavalry.  To sum it all up the game is great and a must have for any war fanatic. 
377	1	a	A cross between a third-person shooter/Tower Defense game, it also features amusing dialogue and a lot of room for creativity. This game is a ludicrous amount of fun. Buy it, right now. No, seriously, buy it right â¥â¥â¥â¥ing now.
2749	1	a	This is one of the best Total war games ever! Played for 200H
3073	1	a	Great history game with to much things to do.
3604	1	a	I have been playing this game for 214 hours, and as I'm new to the Total War franchies I can not compare it to the previous games, but, as a game I find that it is extremely addicting, I find myself playing it often, trying new factions, and different ways of playing. Though, I have not been able to fight in sea battles, as I can't quite grasp the technique to winning, so I auto-resolve them. As for land battles, I find them challenging and fun. The campain map is beautiful and well designed. The historical correctness of this game, however, is way off, I have conquered the entire campain map as Great Britain, which historically never happend, but, if that doesn't matter to you, then it doesn't matter. Ultimately, if you like strategy, and don't mind changing history, then this game is probably going to work for you. I would highly recommend it for anyone.
1016	1	a	If you like Tower defense games, this is worth the $15!! Quoting one of the Orcs 'I'm just a day away from retiring!' LOL!
2489	1	a	An amazing game based on real historical events.
2919	1	a	Want to conquer the world 18-19th century style? want to out-fab your opponents? Want to steal a galleon with small boat, then do the same with the galleon? want to have guns in melee with american-indians who just can't let you shoot them since they go kamikaze in you? ...you get the point. GET IN NOW !
4179	1	a	I have owned and played all the Total War games from the first release of TW Shogun way back in 2000, to the latest TW Atila. All versions have had their pros and cons through the generations, from: terrible sprite-based graphics in an informative and easy to play early generation; through to the overly simplified mechanics of a beautifully rendered latest generation, all have had their good and the bad.    Putting aside historical inaccuracies and other criticisms of related to some liberties that may have been take to create these games, one has to remember that these are game, not simulations, and that they have to strike a balance between accuracy and playability to deliver enjoyment. That's the balance TW Empire delivers well...  I got TW Empire retail disk as soon as it came out. However, I didnât get to really enjoy playing because the initial version ran poorly, even on my relatively powerful computer. It was playable but the choppy performance really had an impact on a poor first impression.    I played it and enjoyed how they treated the period. The masse battle lines of musketry, the roar of cannon, and the charge of sabre and lance, all really brought something to TW that had been long overdue. The quality of the battles wasnât really better than its predecessor, just different, so different tactics had to be employed.    The more significant change was in the campaign management, which provided good improvements that added some depth, while still making the game easily managed.    I won't go to great detail about the above, but to reiterate that this is a well balanced game that weights detail and accuracy, against playability and entertainment, quite well. It combines the empire building and strategic management aspect with the real-time three dimensional tactical action well.
3305	1	a	Great game but you really need darth mod for the more history part of it.
3597	1	a	Everything is awesome, I'm sure that everyone should buy this game. Graphic and battles are amazing.
5170	1	a	It's well phat, mate.
2440	1	a	Awesome historical Game where you play as a Nation, Britian, France, Prussia, Austria, Martha Confederacy and the Ottomans to name a few, and attempt to conquer the world. Loads of fun with turn based decisions on the world map and real time army and naval battles.
4100	1	a	The simplified interface elements, great campaign, and much-improved map and information screens make this the most accessible Total War yet, and a great place for those unfamiliar with the series to get started. Empire: Total War is a must buy for any strategy lover and in general for anyone who owns a PC. Creative Assembly has taken the best aspects of the Total War saga adding new ones that integrate perfectly in the gameplay and the result is a game with wonderfully deep strategy and tactics elements.
571	1	a	My god this game is perfect, needs a co-op though, luckilt the second one has it. But holy â¥â¥â¥â¥, this game is the funnest 3 hours ive spent procrastinating an essay in ages   GET IT.
1245	1	a	Cool, simple tower defender. Limited in scope, but not bad for $5.
2140	1	a	It really good
5193	1	a	Space Pirats and Zombies is a fantastic achievement in of itself. Its in the same vein as the old Star Control games in that it features an entirely 'Top Down' perspective space combat experience. Despite what may seem like a straight forward simple game at first glance will quickly be washed away by how massive the galaxy can be if you so choose. SPAZ sports an intuitive levelling system where you earn points to spend on research to boost the attributes of several systems of your ships. From shields to turrets to the crew itself, the inner workings of your vessels will be fine tuned as you grow. Where you choose to research also determines what higher quality systems you will be able to implement as you acquire various blueprints for more efficient arms and armors.   I would highly recommend this game to any and all who enjoy space combat. Its very action packed and exciting, at least in my opinion.  It is truly the triumph of a motivated two man development team!  
5252	1	a	Space Pirates and Zombies (SPAZ) is a top-down, 2D space pirate combat game where you explore the galaxy completing quests, finding resources, and upgrading your ships. There is a story here, but in between heavy grinding sessions, I forgot what was actually going on. Overall, the game is fun and the combat is exciting, but I did get frustrated many times after getting thoroughly whooped on the battlefield (battle-space?). Hopefully SPAZ 2 will be released soon with improved features and gameplay.  PROS + Controls are intuitive once you get used to them (WASD oriented towards mouse pointer) + Combat is mostly fun and exciting + Large number of ship upgrades and modules to purchase and find + Customizing ships is fun (weapons, armor, subsystems, specialists) + Resources (currency, data, and manpower) are plentiful + Each star system has factions to interact with via quests and events (but...see CON)  CONS - Mothership can only be upgraded after certain story missions (required for most other upgrades) - Grinding is necessary to advance - Most missions ultimately feel the same (battle after battle after battle...) - Since faction respect doesn't carry between systems, it feels rather unimportant long-term - Needs autosave function
4769	1	a	One of my all time favorites ^.^
4956	1	a	What do you get if you cross an arcade shooter with an RPG, and then add in a turn-based strategy zombie apocalypse scenario for the end game?  Yeah, this is what you get. And it's a really awesome indie game.
1114	1	a	If you are debating whether to get the 1st or 2nd game, get the 2nd or the 2nd and the 1st. If you get both (get them on sale and it'll only be around $4 total), you get extra levels and DLC.   Also be warned that the first game has super high mouse sensitivity, so if you don't have a very small mousepad or super slow mouse DPI, get the 2nd game.
3276	1	a	One of the best Total War games in my opinion with lots of management to go with the actual fighting.With nearly the full world to fight over an the addition of multiplayer it should be given a try especially as its quite cheap to buy now. I found mine in Gamestation for Â£12.
3192	1	a	Despite its rocky, bug addled realease in 2009, Emipre Total War is a solid game in the Total War franchise. If your looking for a Total War game with guns, Napoleon Total War and Fall of the Samurai are both more mechanicly adept, however no other Total War has the scope of Empire's Grand Campaign.
4463	1	a	Great game, can`t believe they made clash of clans (castle siege) instead of a decent sequel.
4200	1	a	belive me after over 960 hours of play i assure you this game is ballin!
4399	1	a	It does have a few bugs here and there, but the gigantic size of the campaign map is a good enough reason to play this game. Also you get ship battles and improved trading. Napoleon total war has a little bit better battle system and visuals, but this makes it all even with the grand campaign.
1279	1	a	Yo Dawg! We heard you like shmups, so we put a shmup inside your shmup, so you can shmup while you shmup!
2337	1	a	After years of being a console gamer, I'm just now starting to play PC games and so far the Total War series has me kicking myself for not starting sooner.   The gameplay gets you hooked and the tactical battles have me spending hours at a time formulating winning strategies.  Definietly reccomend this and other games in the series
4572	1	a	Spaceships, zombies, lasers and pirates - what could go wrong? Best gaem evah!
4543	1	a	'I wonder if their eyes really do POP in space?!'
3163	1	a	Fantastic game overall. The first total war to be based on ranged troops works great. The graphics are good even by todays standards, there is variation between the units of the different countries, and tons of modding support for it. You can literally never get tired of it. The technology addition from medieval 2, based not on city size but educational buildings to advance and get bigger and better units. There is some crappy formation issues with the AI who has no clue what its doing half of the time, but there are mods to fix those issues. I highly recommend the warpath addon, highly. The empire total factions mod is good to get. 9/10 fantastic, with the warpath campaign, almost perfect. Pick this one up if you like the other total war games, if this goes on sale, its a no brainer to pick up.
3112	1	a	All of the total war games are awesome!
2146	1	a	Became prussia, Followed the tutorial that said Take over west prussia i did, I took over west prussia took my troops out Poland attacked west prussia with like 1000 troops, I had 480 armed citizens, I defended West Prussia. rip Poland lost everything to Prussian Empire, fix Poland and I now have an Alliance (Since they are still to strong, but I did take over their Protecorates, because they were still at war with me) Now I march towards Denmark
4172	0	a	A questionable and improvable wargame. Have good graphics, wonderfull management mechanics, decent historical research and a huge and inmersive main campaign with various maps at once. But all those efforts are ruined by probably the most cheater AI of Total War Series: basically, when a single player get better, reacts crushing its own rules in economic and diplomatic issues to turn the tide, far away from any logic reason politic or strategical, as only way to maintain the challenge against him; penalizing excessively the combat automatization forces the players to fight every battle, making waste time to those not like the mere tactic or scenaries without true cenital camera. Sure that is fine on mutilplayer mode, because the impact of IA is reduced.
5154	1	a	A excellent space exploration game with some awesome space battles. Extremely addictive and fun, the battles just get bigger and better not to mention creating your own fleet as you progress.  Well spent $15. This game could be worth double and I'd gladly buy it.
3268	1	a	Empire: Total War is decent in vanilla. If you want the real thing: get DarthMod Empire, and you won't stop playing this awesome Total War game.
495	1	a	
5096	1	a	Without a doubt, a very fun game that clicks all the right boxes. You can pick up and play at any time, but be careful because you will get drawn into the game, and before you know it 4 hours have passed
3287	1	a	Love The Game! Excellent for all you total war fans out there!
4886	1	a	Fun little top-down space shooter, good for killing some time and blowing some â¥â¥â¥â¥ up!
888	1	a	This was a very well done action/defence game.   The game has a really nice art stlye and the graphics are nice. I just like the look of the game.  The gameplay Is fluid and well done. The controls are easy to learn. There is a good amount of traps and abilities for you to use on the vast amount of orcs you will be slaying.   Overall the game is fun. I would recommend giving the game a try.
586	1	a	My favorite tower-defense game as of now. No co op unlike others, but it doesn't spoil the fun.  Approximately 20 levels with 3 different difficulty settings, nice graphics and charme. Wide variety of traps/spells/npcs to help you kill ALL the orcs!
4525	1	a	Why are space pirates called space pirates? Because they arrr in space
2438	1	a	I love this era and love it even more in gaming. It is hard to find strategy games first during this time in history and secondly with this much content. I really with that would have made more countries playable and/or expanded the map. But I would still give this game a 9 out of 10 and would recommend this to anyone to atleast give it a try.
4596	1	a	SPAZ is like an updated Escape Velocity. Thomas approves.
4427	1	a	this game is amazing
1599	1	a	invaded Russia in Winter as Prussia, took it. Roughly 200 years later  Russia: 'who's laughing now'.
1181	1	a	When Disciples 3 first came out it was a total mess. I uninstalled it within hours.  With the suggestion of a friend I tried Reincarnation and it was suprisingly good.  It still is a very complicated and struggling experience for the beginners but it is a must for the fans of the series.  AyrÄ±ca 'benim sadÄ±k yarim kara topraktÄ±r'
3765	1	a	Love the game. Wish it had mod support BUT this game is from 2009 so it makes sense why it doesnt. After 400 hours of playing this game I still love it
756	1	a	Entertainingly Epic
42	1	a	Most Tower Defense games are a fairly hands-off genre; you build towers and they do their thing, with your involvement being where to put them and when to upgrade. But lately there have been some that let the player get into the action more personally, and Orcs Must Die is a great example of that. Compared to the nameless protagonists of the last two games, OMD puts you in the shoes of the Apprentice, one of many War Mages tasked with defending rifts to the human world from bands of invading orcs. His tutelage has come to an end though, thanks to his master taking a fatal tumble, forcing him into the role completely. As the Apprentice is a combination of Gaston from Beauty and the Beast and Groose from Skyward Sword, this isn't necessarily a good thing, especially not when the orcs seem to be getting more organized suddenly.  Instead of defending whole territories like other games, each level in Orcs Must Die takes place in a different fort, with a rift on one end and the orcs (as well as other enemies) charging in through the other. So rather than towers, you'll be placing down booby traps instead: spike traps on the floor, walls that shoot out arrows, even swinging maces you can put on low ceilings. It's not too hard to create a total death course enemies will futilely try to wade through. The game's combo system, the ragdoll physics, and the orcs' voice clips as they're being pulverized all help encourage this very well. The Apprentice also has some weapons of his own for crowd control, or the odd enemy that manages to get through your traps.  Each level offers up to five skulls, four for not taking any damage and one for speed, which you can use to upgrade your traps permanently. These range from extra damage on some, to slowing enemies, to dramatically increasing speed. It can make many traps much more useful, although what you spend can't be refunded. The game has 24 levels, which I beat in about ten hours. That unlocks the Nightmare difficulty, which offers tougher enemy placement and much less time to prepare between waves. I didn't find the base game that difficult, so it's a nice option if you want it. There's also some cheap DLC, which offers a few extra tools and some new levels; nothing necessary, but good if you want to get a bit more out of the game. And with one this well-made, there's not much reason you wouldn't.
3261	1	a	A great strategy game!
1268	1	a	A bit boring &amp; a bit pointless. Sorry, infinite shooter of critical acclaim ;)
1662	1	a	Perfect for people liking strategy games ..  You can either play at land or sea or play one of the campaigns and take back city near where you live ! you can also play siege game modes where you either are attacker or defender as defender you defend the castle and attackers must take it by climbing up ladders at the forts walls or by pushing in the doors.
2719	1	a	Very adicting
2022	1	a	This is a great game. I only wish it had multiplayer capability. This is one of those rare games where you get to experience how millitary and diplomatic strategies worked in historical times. To anyone just starting the game, I would recommend a mod called Darthmod Total war for Empire total war. It is a complete overhaul and improves on everything. My only complaint is that the map AI is a 'little' stupid.  All in all, great game!
5222	1	a	Let's wait for Space Pirates and Zombies 2
5011	1	a	This was going to be just a game I decided to get that was cheap and could kill time. Turns out I got really tangled into the cool storyline of the game and more than likely had no hope of hating it as combines Space, Pirates, And Zombies!  The graphics seem simple but there's a lot more detail than I expected and the backgrounds to the levels are designed beautifully. Probably somethings you might be able to see in space with the right filters.  Gameplay can become a bit repetative though. It mostly consists of moving to the next planet, destroying an enemy and possibly mine an asteroid. Buy some parts and upgrade your ship.  Still, I've already put a couple of hours into this game and I don't intend to put it down anytime soon.
3246	1	a	amazing in every way
3363	0	a	Love the game, hate Steam.
697	1	a	This game has soul. A 3rd person shooter/tower defense mix, the traps are neat, the levels are fun, and the dialogue is frikkin hilarious. It has a moderate learning curve, so dont expect to get perfect scores on your first play through, but it grows on you. A high level of polish, great sounds, animations, and design make this a great game worth the price. 9/10
291	1	a	
4977	1	a	This game is a ridiculous grind and nothing more. The first hour tutorial and background story is annoying.  The only way to enjoy this game is by using the easiest settings and getting high.  you're gonna be doing the same thing over and over again for 60+ hours anyway.
2870	1	a	This game is fun. There's a reason I have almost 400 hours into this game.
3022	1	a	ETW Is one of those games that still holds up to this day. Although it is 7 years old, And the developers dont pay any attention to it anymore, It still has a strong loyal community that will always keep it going. I myself have been playing ETW for 2 years now and I think it is still a pretty fun and casual game to play.
3526	1	a	It's in the title really. Rather than focusing on the battles, this game is about Empire-builing. Get Napoleon if you want battles.
1554	1	a	Fun world domination. Once the wars get old or slow, just overwhelm and auto resolve combat. Take a weak nation, and eventually own all of Europe, the Americas, Noarth Africa, Middle East, Russia, and India. Lots of infrastructure upgrades. Making allies, keeping them, dealing with enemies, and the killing allies is what this game is about. Diplomacy, War, Nation Building, and Strategy. Great all around, until you finally beat it, or take over most of the world. After that, it sits in your libraru untouched like most other games.
4874	1	a	Wow, best $1.99 (Steam sale) I ever spent! Hours of fun, surprisingly deep, yet still 'casual' (easy to start and stop at any time) gameplay... the only problem is that it's so addictive, you won't want to stop for hours at a time. Bargain of the century!
721	1	a	I was genuinely surprised by this game. I like killing Orcs, (thank you Warhammer: Space Marine) so I decided to pick this up. It is simply a great game. The dialogue knows its place, the graphics are beautiful, the gameplay is absolutely solid. A great balance between combat and defensive strategy. The maps ramp in difficulty quite nicely, and the creators were smart to add enemies that will mess with tactics that worked a few maps ago. Forcing the player to really think about each map is something that shows good game design and I really admire it. If you like tower defense games and are looking for something a bit different, definitely check this out.
3589	1	a	All around a really good game, the battles can be a little hardware intense but they are extremely fun. This is a much different type of RTS than Sins starcraft. the only problem I have is that the AI has no idea how to handle walls. My troops would be on top of the walls with gun and I would tell them to attack a unit on the ground and instead of just shooting them they would charge down the wall and sword fight them.
1931	1	a	One of the best Total war i have play Really good, you should get it
4600	1	a	Mighty good fun so far.
1329	1	a	Awesome Game! Just Wish they'd hurry up and make Total War: Civil War!!!
1274	1	a	'we need to go deeper!'  An infinitely procedurally generated word. Infinite in the scope of a human lifetime.  Go into enemies to make them weaker, go into power ups to make them stronger.   Like 'Inception', except, it NEVER ends.   Insanely difficult, and hard to manage where you are. Very interesting, and majorly rewarding when you finally get to a place and plant your flag in a place NO HUMAN has ever been.  7.5/10 Try, a must if you like shooters or very interesting indies.
889	1	a	Fun, inventive tower defense with a wide variety of build paths--not just in terms of the towers and other defensive implements that you deploy, but also the RPG-like paths for upgrading your player character and your ability to participate in the defense first hand. Very satisfying, although the game's 'humor' wears thin almost immediately. Definitely pick this up on a fire sale if you enjoy novel takes on tower defense.
4806	1	a	really great space fighting game with a good story
3229	1	a	Been playing the Total War series since the original Shogun; They cant be beat.
4668	1	a	The best space opera I've played since Master of Orion 2. Cuts back on the resource management of other games in its class and focuses more on the strategy of ship building and space combat. A great RPG with a pretty solid story that doesn't take itself too seriously.
4867	1	a	Everything about this game works. It's fun, fluid, addictive and just really shockingly well done... and it was all done by two guys working from home. Brilliant game, worth your time and money.
2417	1	a	While I do recommend this this game, I do so hesitantly.  Despite enjoying hours and hours of game time across a few years, I find that while I do enjoy the game itself it has a tendency to become somewhat repedetive and less interesting after you reach a certain point in the campaign. The battles are perhaps where the game falls the shortest; the urge to use basic units because of their effectiveness is high and the generals (which are essentially recruitable wherever you have an army) are bland and I find I am unable to invest any interest in them whatsoever.  The naval battles, however, are a nice addition from previous Total War games and despite having to get used to them (which may take a litttle time) they are one of the game's freshest facets.   Despite the recommendation for this game, I would suggest instead of aquiring Empire: Total War, one should rather invest in a different title under the Total War franchise, such as Medieval II or Shogun II - both of which are more versatile and fresh than Empire: Total War. However, if you are looking for an incredibly vast playing map in the years dominated by political and militaristic imperialism, Empire: Total War may be what you are searching for, especially with the revolutionary options available at any times within the Campaign.
870	1	a	A truly awesome tower defense style game. Incredibly addictive and can also be a fun party game, hours and hours of fun. The difficulty level actually means something in this game, I would recommend to anyone 95/100 one of the best games in 2011 in my opinion.
2550	1	a	its just really fun guys
462	1	a	Great gameplay, a lot of humour and very interesting concept of a game.
2343	1	a	Well I have to say, FREAKING SPECTACULAR. But I cant seem to get past one of the missions due to some of the enemy players being glitched outside the map and also some others being glitched so they are invisible to me but on the minimap they are visible. But other than that. For all you well know and underknowleged strategy gamers I recommend this game. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 10/10 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- And a word for the devs, C.P.D has your back XD
1106	1	a	Achievement Hunter Review: An incredibly fun tower defense/third-person hybrid. Took me around 20 hours to 100% as the first game of its style that I've played.
2907	1	a	good game if you like 18th century warfare this is for you
1989	1	a	Love the sea battles!
568	1	a	one of the best games i have ever played
1837	1	a	I love it :D
1327	1	a	The Second-Best Strategy game that I have played! Empire: Total war let you go into the past time and control armies. That include the French, the Indians, America, and English Red Coat army! The graphics are excellent, and the gameplay is smooth, no errors !The game is totally epic! I reccomend playing this ultra awesome game.
887	1	a	Great game, lots of fun while killing monsters :)
2553	1	a	Empire total war is good except it does not include the whole world map to play with also Total war series should release a new game with more good ruling system for the empire like the game should have more things to build in the region in the city and all of that should be custom.
3476	1	a	It's better then Civ V.
4259	1	a	Other than the A.i. problems. This is my favorite in the total war series. they made so many changes to the world view and city management later on that just makes the game so much slower than this one.
828	1	a	Awesome game! - Many fun hours spent =)
218	1	a	Love this game, so much fun. Just buy it already.
3046	1	a	Best campaign map, worst battles
5151	1	a	Fight, Collect, Upgrade, Explore. It takes a few basic videogame elements and combines them into a enjoyable whole. The best space ship game I have played in a long while.
3244	1	a	Still love this game. Left Rome 2 and come back to this game :)
3886	1	a	If you love the Total War series like me, then let me say something about this game. This game is the worst Total War I have ever played. Does not contain a lot of cities to conquer, the game feels devoid of life. Shogun 2 is much much more better than this.
4920	1	a	Buy this game
329	1	a	amazingly fun. very hard to put down
1706	1	a	Great strategy game Sean Bean approved
2353	0	a	Crashes every 10 minutes, unplayable...
1684	1	a	Its so fun controllng you own army.
1351	1	a	Its one of the best multi-player game ever better than rome 2 -1, napo and show!!!!!!!!!!
1253	0	a	Very Very bad sound quality on towers. very short on towers, you can choose from 5 difrent only. ive seen free to play tower defence waaaay better than this. dont buy this....
1577	1	a	i really do like this game i just wish we could easily mod it (legally) 
775	1	a	Orcs, Must, DIE! that is a fact of life, challenging game, tower defense style that can frustrate you for hours.
30	1	a	This game is quite simple: Shoot, slice and blow up all the orcs. Its a nice mix of TD and a medieval fighting game. WIth the talent-like choices you can personalise how you wanna play each level, going trap heavy, combat heavy or a mix. The story is not bad but is not the strong point. The funny coments you character makes sometimes are quite cool tho. 08/10!  Pros: - Kill orcs (need say more?) - Several diferent levels with diferent kinds of enemies - Choose how you wanna play (TD heavy or slash/shoot heavy) - Smart â¥â¥â¥ coments that can actualy make you giggle (maybe...)  Cons: - Not story rich - Could get repetitive (but really, killing orcs gets boring for you guys??)
1250	1	a	This game is well worth the Â£3.00
59	1	a	Great game with nice humour
3125	1	a	A great game if you're a fan of large battles with muskets, cannons and cavalry, 18th century warfare, RTS/TBS or just killing danes.
3430	1	a	This is a fun game that take the Total War Series into new territory with its excellent ship battles and gunfire units.
2643	1	a	Good game, wish you could play all factions w/o modding and the Grand Campaign was more balanced, but still one of CA's best titles. Play it.
2648	1	a	this game is very very very good as you can travel around the world forging your empire :p
3541	1	a	After a rough start and several patchs,this game is quite good and the standard for tactical combat,The campaign map however is laughably poor compared to Paradox's offerings when it comes to grand strategy.Still I recommend this game for its tactical battles and multiplayer.
3731	1	a	Best game ever including the DLC
5333	1	a	A brilliant simulator beyond words.  Drop your CoD console controllers and get in here.   Nobody will call you a 'â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥' or a 'â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥' or threaten to â¥â¥â¥â¥ your mother.  In here - we are all in it together, equally worthless and equally ambitious ;)  \m/
1258	1	a	If you enjoy the concept of games as art than this could be for you. I find it to be one of those games I can get lost in for a few 15 minute sessions here and there. There are some points where it's either over the top difficult or because of the power ups you've achieved it's too easy but those moments in between are great fun.
1610	1	a	When you play campaign:  Yes! you finally conquered the place you have been stacking troops and agents for days!, wait what is that? the ally of that enemy has sent three of his generals and their highly trained army after you, well guess what? THATS WHY YOU SHOUD'VE HAD ALLIES INSTEAD OF REJECTING SOME NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBE YOU JERK!!! To put in a sentence, For this game, plan ahead............whether you have a mass army and a higher advantage, or a poor army and unstable cities, they will find you, and its never safe in Total War.
433	1	a	Woo! I love tower defense!
3273	1	a	This game is a game about murdering indians and british soldiers
2285	0	a	If you have Windows ten dont bother it doesnt work, it crashes at the loading screen 
622	1	a	Surprisingly fun and well put together tower defense game. In a similar fashion to Sanctum, you place traps in the path of your enemies to protect the gate from every wave of increasingly stronger Orcs. You can also use multiple spells and weapons at your disposal to help even the odds. Managed to get 15 hours on my first play through so lots of good gameplay there for the price!  TL;DR: Game is good n' â¥â¥â¥â¥. Go buy it.
2300	1	a	Empire:  +Massive, 3 Theater World (Although crippled by small # of provinces) +Many different nations to choose from (Sharing the same bland, cookie cutter format albeit) +Fire by Rank +Open Ended Campaign  -AI (Campaign and Battle) -Bugs (Half finished on release and I'm being kind) -Same units for each army mostly -Same ships for each navy -Doesn't feel polished (Wonder why)  Napoleon:  +Better AI +More army differentiation +Attrition and Supply System +More, smaller regions +Better art design (completely subjective, but the 'portraits' in ETW were horrible) +Physically larger campaign map +Enhanced GFX engine  -Smaller scope -Cost high for what is essentially a glorified expansion -little, if any integration or enhancement with/for its parent game, ETW -Only 4 nations to choose from in GC -was developed and released during a time when CA should have been focusing all its energy on repairing and upgrading Empire
3465	1	a	very good game u should buy it
3045	1	a	One of my favourite Total War games. The setting fits well with TW gameplay.
141	1	a	Really fun single player game, you should check it out if you get the chance. Very addictive, and the constant mayhem and slaughter makes it a game I couldn't put down until I beat it.
4605	1	a	This is a game with a great core gameplay loop - load up a couple of ships with various items and fly them around frantically through a swarm of other ships blowing stuff up. The action-oriented 2D combat is great fun, with surprisingly great physics and object interaction for such a seemingly simple game. The fact that the plot and the elements in play radically changes halfway through the game is a bonus, and works great even though the zombies are spoiled by the game's actual title.  There are a few issues I had with the game though. Grinding for resources and data can be quite a hassle - the less you grind, the harder the combat is, because your equipment simply won't be as good. Updating your tech RPG-style is really compelling, but unfortunately not every tech is created equal. Techs all cost the same, but it seems clear to me that investing 50+ skillpoints in, say, Hull strength or Shields is vastly preferable to investing the same amount of points in something like Bombs (a really specific type of weapon) or Crew (only situationally useful). Maybe this depends on playstyle, but I tried investing in things like Subsystems or Launchers at first and found the benefits just weren't as tangible.  Also, for a game that probably takes even experts 30+ hours to complete, the fairly small number of mission types gets old fairly quickly.  That said, the core gameplay is really fun and made it worth it for me, and the sense of progress you get teching up and defeating fleets that would have smeared you to a paste several hours earlier is tangible and rewarding. If you've got a lot of time and like a simple 2D action game, give this a shot!
3194	1	a	Put Simply an awesome game! I cant stop playing it i just want to conquer everthing and everyone and make damn! sure i have the biggest and best armies, and with the amazing Mods made by the fans added in making the armies countless of thousands strong, it just makes a remarkable game to play!   10/10 
1231	1	a	This game is very addictive. Maybe its the sound effects, maybe its the blowing up of stuff, i dunno but its definitely fun :-)
1013	1	a	This is a fun game but it's definitely quirky.  + Interesting level design + Configurable upgrades with Weavers  - Some levels way too open with too few options to build defenses - You can't refund skulls; so you anticipation/guessing plays into unlocking items - You can't redefine keys (defaults to WASD) which is ... short-sighted - No option to create your own maps 
1512	0	a	I can only recommend this game if you intend to play with mods. It's way to basic and has some serious AI problems...
4666	1	a	Pretty fun viddy oggem although TB does voice overs still worth playing
2041	1	a	8/10 Too much water -ign
4612	1	a	Runs Flawless and For the low price tag and the extreme amount of content included its a crime. Get this Game and you can go on a spree of your very own!
948	1	a	One of the best tower defense games out there. It has a lot of variety and you feel rewarded for progressing through the game.  10/10
4303	1	a	Great Game!
4830	1	a	I have about halfway through the game so far and it has been an enjoyable experience. The combat is fast and exciting. the ship movement is fluid and the game has plenty of content. For anyone looking for a 2D action space game you should really consider this game for the purchase.
3029	1	a	the game is pretty good but it crashes way to much
4326	1	a	This Total War game is likely my favorite of the entire series. Any lover of this period of warfare should pick this game up.
1234	1	a	iBomber Defense is one of the funnest tower defense games I have played in a long time. Especially because it is based on WWII. Also, the game developers are badass and didn't mind putting swastikas as well as iron crosses on Nazi jeeps, tanks, and other forces. A great game especially for the price. I'd have paid twice as much. By the way there is a sequel of sorts called iBomber Defense Pacific, which as you may have guessed is against the Japanese mainly from islands and mainlands shooting at boats and the occasional air raid. I have both but this one is my favorite. Fighting in the forests of German, and eventually Berlin is indescribable in how fun it is.
2468	1	a	amazing my favourite of the total war series
1225	1	a	nice tower defense - where's my touchscreen? td on mouse is so oldskool
4235	1	a	This game is so much fun! It has the best campaign of any Total War game. The reason being is that you can play on all parts of the world. From NA and SA to asia, you can watch as war rages across the globe. The only continent not included is Antarctica. So, if you like to play the campaign (and multiplayer is good too), buy this game. I would love to see an Empire 2 with new graphics features, and some more unique units. That would be perfect.
899	1	a	A bit repetitive but quite funny. I wasn't expecting much so I was pleasantly surprised. Don't expect any deep strategy here, just lots of lightweight mayhem :-)
344	1	a	It's a kind of game that you want to play it more and more! I also liked it because there is ranking system so I always try to win my friends. The best tower defense I've ever played...
1212	1	a	Playing Disciples III was a nice surprise, and I liked it a lot the fact that you have individual units instead of numbers which decrease with damage, here you can take care of them while leveling up your Hero.  I was looking for something like Heroes, since Uplay lost my key to Heroes VI,  and Ubisoft's never answered back, so...  Thumbs up for this one !!! :)
3487	1	a	A quality change into the Total War franchise.   The standard strategy changes completely, enter technology trees and discover the power of the fortified garrisons. Also, you at last can play naval battles.  Maybe you think that you love massive gory hand to hand medieval battles and that the use of gunpowder perverted the art of war into something boring and dishonorable. After you play this game a few hours you'll discover a new world of positioning, discipline and tactics... not to mention heavy cannon use!  A worthy addition to the Total War saga, and the only one when you can play almost in the whole globe.
1355	1	a	this is very good game
2227	1	a	It's okay I guess
1741	1	a	This is for players that love Army control over the battle field. And its RTS which is awesome. If you've got a good computer the graphic are amazing!
2646	1	a	great game fun for hours 
1591	1	a	My dog played a game against a complete n00b and still won the battle 9000/101
3830	1	a	Yeah, pretty good game. [HIGHLY UNFINISHED AND RUSHED BY E.A] But still...... a good game..
460	1	a	You know, the condom is the glass slipper of our generation. You slip it on when you meet a stranger. You dance all night, then you throw it away. The condom, I mean. Not the stranger.
1665	1	a	You know a lot of people poop on this game for the ai but i think this is in fact one of my most favorite strategy games. heck it was like my first steam game its a great casual game that has like no learning curve and anyone can jump right in. perfect for everyone
1187	0	a	I don't really see this game as being worthy, I feel like it's just trying to be Might and Magic Heroes, if anything, get the old Might and Magic Heroes 3 on GOG.
1259	0	a	If I was given a chance to refund a single game, it would be this.   There is an interesting mechanic (diving into enemies, power-ups etc.) but its connection to the game is vague at best. Going into something feels nothing more than a ânext levelâ button , thus making it easier to lose track of your progress, everything looks so similar, if not identical.
4768	1	a	What more could you want?
3516	1	a	A game that can be rather hard to get into. Battles can be easy if you know the correct tactics. I love the technologies that are upgradable and can turn the tide of a battle if you have the better equipment. Make allies and enemies at your peril and try to become Emperor of the world. Recomend this to anyone who has loved theTotal War series and who loves a good strategy game!
2495	1	a	All Total War games are a must buy for strategy fans, or history fans. I read alot of military history in my spare time, and the Total War series have always been the most historically accurate and most realistic strategy games I've played. This is currently my favorite from the franchise. If you want a more realistic or challenging experience, look for mods on the internet.
968	1	a	Best Tower Defence game ever
2474	1	a	Best Game out of the Total War Series because of the Fact Theres alot more nations to play as and fighy #ETW
3690	1	a	great game
331	1	a	Hello, Gamers.  Look at your Steam Library, now back to mine, now back at your Library, now back to mine. Sadly, yours isn't mine.  Why? Because if you stopped for a moment with all of your other games, you could be bisecting, stabbing, flaming and otherwise giving hordes of Orcs a very bad day, all while having an absolute blast of a time.  Okay, I'm horrible at copying Old Spice commercials... Orcs Must Die! is a game that describes itself right in its title, there's you, there's the Orcs, the latter must die. The fun is in how you have them die. The game is blindingly simple, the 'plot' is idiotically brilliant, and it's fun all around.  Kind of like Warhammer Fantasy.
542	1	a	good 3rd person tower defence
300	1	a	Very fun and challenging. A great choice if you enjoy strategy and tower defense.
370	1	a	pretty fun little game, wish it was multiplayer
258	0	a	It looks fun doesn't it? yeah thats what I thought too. But that was before I got it.   The concept of being able to attack yourself and use towers is nice and when executed properly works well. Orcs Must Die did not execute it well. Its problem is that if you don't attack you fail and on most every map there are 2 points the orcs come from and there are not 2 of you so you kill 1 side while the other gets through then you go to push back the other side meanwhile the side you were protecting gets up and then your at the very end of the map trying to shoot 2 ways at 1 time and it doesn't work. The only tower to make your enemys stop (at least as far as I played) is not even a tower its a KILLABLE Paladin. So unless you make like 3 of those at each side they all die. Even with 3 they die. Even with lots of support from ranged towers they die. Without using them the enemys move too fast and your towers can't hit them for long enough to kill them and you die.  Another big problem is that they tryed to make too many towers. You get a tower after each level and they were probably running out of ideas and were just making stupid things. What I really don't like is that 90% of the towers have almost no difference except look or wether its on the wall or the floor or the ceiling. And alot of them just push the orcs so they are only usefull in certain levels where they can push the orcs off the level. Also the ceiling mounted ones alot are useless because the level will have too high ceilings and they won't hit anything.  It was fun for the first 8ish levels but overall I give it a 5/10. I would recommend you go buy Sanctum 2
2754	1	a	Played as Sweden. Came up with master plan to destroy Prussian pigs. Surrounded their borders before delaring war. Wiped them out in one turn. 69/10 would nail Prussia again.
4531	1	a	This game is cool as â¥â¥â¥â¥. It gets pretty hard once the zombies are introduced, but you'll enjoy the entire game. Well, if it looks like your kind of thing, anyway. While writing this review I'm actually having trouble coming up with anything negative to say about this game. It's great, so just get it.
4685	1	a	Bought this game before it was on steam, developer was nice to provide a steam key afterwards.  Played it for hundreds of hours, and then hundreds more when developer added mod support.  Heavily recommended to anyone who likes space, shooters, ship customization or Space Rangers.
4618	1	a	The game is beautiful, colours, graphics, gameplay is astounding. Personally for me, I got over 14 hours in during the first week of play. the game has great continous play, and replayability, much similar to the 'roguelike', that is Dungeons of Dreadmoar. It is enjoyable, although ti could be better, For such a spectacularly low price that it is, it's a steal, and it's worth every second.
780	1	a	Fun! Fast paced Mayhem! With a great sense of humor!
1823	1	a	Be sweden Take Norway Riot starts in norway Ignore riot to get Russia Full army in russia and no defense in sweden Riot ruins my game 10/10
275	0	a	Tedious garbage. I could have eaten at Arby's and been laid up with food poisoning for a week, and still have had a better time than I have with the time and money I have invested in this. I don't want a refund, I wish I had never played it.
1177	1	a	I remember the time when I play first Disciples 2. It was so awesome. After Disciples 3 came out, it was also ok for me ^^. Even if they change the combat style and other things, the story is nice.  But I got a question to Multiplayer. Because I want it to play on Net but when its looking for something, its show me error: there is no game. Will be there a patch maybe to fix it? Just asking ^^
4395	1	a	The Marathans stopped trading with me, so I went in and conquered them. 10/10 great Imperialism simulator.
3689	1	a	best of the best!
169	1	a	Gives perfectionists high blood pressure.
5167	1	a	Addictive top down space shooter glowing â¥â¥â¥â¥ collecter game that is somewhere between Star Control 1 and EV: Nova. You control a bit fat Pirate ship that slightly smaller ships launch from and you around killing â¥â¥â¥â¥ and picking up glowing â¥â¥â¥â¥ from their space wreckages that gives you experience points (Data), resource points (called Rez) and slaves (Goons) who work for you and who you can trade for Data or Rez like the worthless scum they are. Also, you pick up new ship schematics by killing fools, which in turn gives you bigger and badder ships to kill people with and collect more â¥â¥â¥â¥. Insidious.
2543	1	a	Extremely interesting and entertaining game, great continuation of the Total War series. High recommended for fans of Rome: Total War, Age of Empires, Hearts of Iron etc.   Plenty of fun, you will get your moneys worth with this title.
1638	1	a	one of my best games
5156	1	a	Fun and modable :P Get it either on sale or not!!!! Worth owning.
2583	1	a	Like 'Total War' with guns. -IGN
4692	1	a	It is what it says in the title. â¥â¥â¥â¥in'... come on, were you expecting mermaids?
312	1	a	Great! Pretty tempted to buy the second one too.
973	1	a	I was hesitant about this game as I find 3rd person views to be very console'ish but was pleasantly surprised. The PC controls are solid and the traps are very satisfying. I wish the levels were longer or you started with more money because it seems like just as you get a really good chain of traps setup then the level is over. That's a minor complaint--overall the game is great.
610	1	a	What do you need to know that the title doesn't tell you?  This is a great introduction into what is quickly becoming one of my favorite series of games.
5046	1	a	Space battles.. realtime mostly. And truly I have no idea why I enjoy this game so much. That and it's dirt cheap for another, oh, 20 minutes :-)
3914	1	a	Very good Strategy game 10/10
3357	1	a	Empire Total War, is in my opinion, the BEST in the series. It has everything in it, great naval battles, huge land battles, opportunities to spy and coerce. I have heard the graphics are really good, i haven't had a system that can play it with everything turned on full. Also being a Brit manageing to beat back the colonies and maintain the 'New World' as British and even knocking out the French in Canada is really refreshing!  But in al seriousness, this game has been out for a few years and still beats Shogun 2 and totally knocks out the new Rome. Its bug free and the DLC (if you bother) is nicely rounded out. THe warpath campaign is worth it to force out the colonists! I haven't played online as I don't do that so cannot give an honest reveiw of online features if there are any. Get this game. But then again, if you love the Total War series, you already have. For a smaller slice of this game get Napolean Total War!
4065	1	a	Best Total War game, in my opinion. Huge improvement in graphics from Med 2; addictive, satisfying gameplay; and no chars on multiplayer. All you could ask for.
3748	1	a	Empire Total War is the most epic game ever, especially with darthmod, plan to try imperial splendour mod soon. Napoleon Total war a close second. I play these games and only these. My thanks to the creators and techs who made it all possible, the game is worth every penny!! Empire is Epic!!!!!
1344	1	a	One of the best total war games in my opinion and the best campaign.
3725	1	a	This is probably my favorite of the Total War series. This one or Shogun! Everything about this version feels very polished!
3448	1	a	I very much like this game and i would recommend it to anyone who loves these kinds of games. my only issue is that they tried to hard to make this into civilization.
2991	1	a	â¤ï¸
299	1	a	Simply put, this game is huge amount of fun. It's an excellent blend of tower defense and action, with an almost comedic atmosphere. If you like hack &amp; slash and/or tower defense, I highly recommend you take a look at this game. Actually, I recommend picking up the franchise pack since both the first and second games are a blast to play.  Comparing this game with its sequel, I liked the levels better in general in this first game, but the second just has a lot more stuff including a second playable character with different traps and abilities, more monster types, and best of all, coop. So do yourself a favor and just get the franchise pack.
2107	1	a	Very Addictive but can become boring after a while.
2956	1	a	Great game I've put in thousands of hours
3130	1	a	After Logging over 50 hours in this game I can say that it is easily one of my all time favorite strategy games. I was blown away by the map size; spanning 4 continents, and also by the intracacy of the in-game economy and diplomacy. If this game was only a real time stragegy battle simulater, it still would have been worth $20. This game is well woth anyones money if theyre looking for a great hybird between a Real Time and Turn Based strategy game.
1075	1	a	Serious fun! Fantasy genre meets Plants vs. Zombies. Lay traps to destroy orcs! Fight orcs! Smash! I can't believe I got this game on sale for so cheap! Fast paced good times!
1073	1	a	Killing orcs. What's not to like?
5205	1	a	Best top-down RPG arcade space shooter around.
342	1	a	Hilarious as hell, yet very challenging and rewarding, a must have if you like orcs chopped up!
4968	1	a	A top-down shmup with customiseable ships, RPG elements related to tech, randomised galaxies, and missions... Really. What's there not to like? Has some nice splashes of humor, too. Very beautiful and rather addictive and the controls are simple and elegant. I hope the expansions continue, 'cuz I can't get enough of this game.
3918	1	a	The game itself is good but the graphics are shocking,a real let down...
2641	1	a	One of The Best Total Wars Out there.... Great battles, Great Campaign, leading your men through victory as they line battle the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of each other. Its also first contact on ship battles so they did alright for it. Could be a bit better but a definet thumbs up for this game!
1370	1	a	In Empire: Total War you can play as one of the many Empire's and Nations that are available for play on the Campaing map or if your the kind of Battle fighing person, You can play online battle's with friend's and people online and combine forces in battle or have a duel of the army's of a 1 vs 1 game. If you feel like testing the game's tactic's there are Regular battle's to fight against automated enemy's and allies. In Empire: Total War, I have enjoyed playing as some of the greatest nations known to the face of the Colonial and Napoleonic era's such as ; Great Britain, France, Spain, Prussia etc, There are many features that in-hense gameplay to really make you feel like your a General on a battlefeild or a great Admiral fighting at sea or to be the King or Queen of a Empire and to control what goes on. Personally this game is a total thumbs up to me and I sugjest to buy and play it if you have time for this stratrgy based game in my openion beat's it's succesor ; Napoleon: Total War. Even though NTW has some better graphics, It adds some new features but it is only in the Europe theatre and there are limited nations you can play as, here are them; Britian, France, Austria, Prussia and Russia. In ETW you have over 6 playable nations to play as and expand your empire in the Americas, Europe and India. ETW may have some things that are a downside, but I totally recommand that you play this Strategy-based game.
2333	1	a	If you like the Total War series, the romaticism of 18th century warfare, or history in general, it's really very simple: you must own this game.
1127	1	a	Very orc
1469	1	a	I had to go back to a 5 yr old game, and damn this beats Rome 2 Total War anyday.
5191	1	a	This is a amazing game. I love it. The story line is just pure bliss.... can't wait for the second game of it.   Buy this game if you love to comit to games, love single player, and love huge fleets of destruction in space. Oh and zombies. :D  It took me 64 hours to complete the game, and thats just sticking with the story and not doing any of the secondary option, and there are TONS.  Over 2 years, I finished it. gg
4287	1	a	worth it. i got really annoyed after playing as the brits and getting suddenly destroyed by literally everyone on earth, but then i played as Marathas and i actually enjoyed it a lot more. great game
4086	1	a	Eh. Wouldn't be my go-to Total War game. My first was Shogun 2 last year. Going to this it is like going to the stone age of games. Doesn't seem to be much freedom in what your units can do. Very simplified and not all that interesting. At least for land battles.  Given how that is the majority of the game, I feel like I can throw in my input.  If you're looking at buying this, I can tell you Shogun 2 is MUCH more interesting and rewarding.
4822	1	a	Surprisingly this is a very good indie game, one of the best I've played.  This is a real-time space shooter game that has some RPG and strategy elements in it. Combined together, it is actually a very addictive game that keeps you playing. You can have a fleet of up to 4 ships, and with it you gather resources, unlock new ships and technology, level up for talent points, trade with the 2 factions in the game to become more powerful. You can help or hinder either of the two factions, and the number of ships they can field in battle will increase or decrease, making your actions influence the galaxy.  The graphics, sound and story are decent enough, but the game-play is top notch.  As of this recommendation, the game is good enough despite being simple. But it could be so much more and the developers plan to add more content. If you have some spare change, consider buying it during a sale and help fund the sequel, SPAZ 2.
3755	1	a	this game is great on my computer are bad but runs beutifly think of this as napoleon but 3X better (my graphics are bad beacuse i have a windows 7 with a duel core procceser) you can conquer the world as russia ottemens americans(beat road of independence campaign) martha confedrecy and you can change goverments to
5198	1	a	my favorite indie game. more people should buy it
2441	1	a	Best in the Series
5280	1	a	What, you DON'T like being a space pirate? Or getting huge lasers and plasma cannons to shoot people with? Or flying around shooting innocent civilian and military members you JUST were allies with simply because you're a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ space pirate and that's what you â¥â¥â¥â¥ing do? Or kicking the â¥â¥â¥ of weird alien zombie necromorph spaceship... things?   What the â¥â¥â¥â¥ is wrong with you?
4885	1	a	Awesome top-down space physics combat shooter!
1063	1	a	Funny, and fill the time, when i need some crazy destruction
5121	1	a	space exploration and combat game with cute graphics and which doesnt take itself too seriously. A breath of retro gaming without hard core difficulty (although that is available too). And when on sale like today, well...GRAB
3482	1	a	Empire Total War is certainly one of the best games in the total war series. The graphics are astounding and the animations are much improved from medieval II total war. The grand campaign is vast and will take a few weeks to complete, assuming that one were to play consistently for a few hours a day. This game also introduces sea-based battles in real time for the first time ever. It may not seem like much, but the dynamics and the sounds of said sea battles are amazing.
5138	1	a	reking scrubs on this is more fun than jumping of a building naked with no eyes  11/10
3938	0	a	The game concept is great, but the execution is abysmally poor. I am running a 670, 4.8ghz 2500k, 16gb ram &amp; ssd. 6 years after the release of this game I cannot even maintain close to a stable 60 fps at 1600x900 resolution and medium-high settings (no AA). It is also a buggy mess with constant crashes and the onset of random stuttering which requires frequent game resets. Despite these problems I have continued trying to play it as it is just so much fun in between the moments of insane frustration.
2779	1	a	absolutely addicting
147	1	a	This game is just fun. The gameplay is straight forward yet offers complexity as well. It doesn't take itself too seriously (this should have been obvious from the get go). Overall a good game especially if you can pick it up on sale.
2608	1	a	love this game
3219	1	a	It's really fun, you play as the hidden dictator or something, because the deaths of your countrie's leaders have no effect on your gameplay, except for relations, but that's a different story. You also play as a general, leading your multple troops to victory, either by storming forts, capturing cities, or interception their movements. You can also play as an admiral, commanding multiple ships, you have a choice of either grape shots, single shot, or chained shot from each ship, there's also a wind element, so if your enemy is upwind, you better not try to retreat. You can capture enemy ships, but not troops (makes sense). In the freeplay mode or something, you have 3 major theaters and a couple trading routes. The major theaters are India, Europe, and North America (including northern South America. It's pretty realistic, the game takes place in one cetury, but it lasts 400 turns (I think). Unlike Civilization V, you don't have to manage workers, but instead you build roads and stuff directly from the cities themselves. I REALLY liked this game, but it's not for everyone. The turns are really slow, and sometimes during the later years, you have no significant opponents. When this happens, you can start a revolution and side with the rebels.
1171	1	a	Great Game!!!  I love it! and i have it the old versions!, changed a lot od the game for good!!  Beautiful graffics and a lot of hours for fun!  the unique thing i dont like it is WHERE THE MONTAIN CLAWS??? T_T   if you like it strategy turns fights buy it and you gonna love!
4414	1	a	This game definatly shows its age but is still in my opinion the best Total War game to date. It is nearly impossible to get bored from this game as well since the map is huge and diverse; and with amazing mods like Darthmod the battles look and feel realistic and epic. A must play for fans of history and/or strategy games alike
3018	1	a	Fantastic and unique game in the Total War franchise, a must buy for any Total War fan.
898	1	a	If you are looking to have a lot of fun with great humor and no hard thinking, this game is for you! :-)
2351	1	a	Excellent, very glad Total War was able to step up and keep the series improving with each iteration. Perfect for anyone who has an interest in warfare of the musket-era.
4440	1	a	This is a very fun game to play with big, or small groups of friends. You get to build your nation from scratch and then destroy your friend's crap! :D I wish more of my friends could play this. It's a shame it's so expensive...
5250	1	a	Great game
4277	1	a	Canister shot is highly effective against a charge.   10/10 Would give those bloody b*st*rds the grape again!
3274	1	a	Great game 10/10 worth every cent. Cannons using canister shot is like a giant shotgun, very awesome, and just everything about the game is awesome.
963	1	a	One of the most fun defense games out
4327	1	a	It's a realy good army controller however if u want multiplayer it sorely lacks in online players at certain parts of the day highly recommended
2284	0	a	Running an empire is too time consuming.
3688	1	a	Ok if you are just getting into the total war games, this is the game to start with.
3632	1	a	Highly recommended!!!
2114	1	a	Basically this game and me have a love hate relationship. The AI is kinda â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. The Sige wall lag bug can ruin what should be epic battles. Otherwise it is fun. I have over 100 hours on this account and on my other account which is locked to to Steam not appreciating my racial humor had over 300. Worth buying on sale. Never a bad choice of youre bored.
3450	1	a	Good game for multiplayer battles, but the campaign can be especially frustrating.
4132	1	a	If you're looking for a game to celebrate your homelands supremacy (in my case glorious Britania) then look no further, for you have found the game you seek, my only gripe with this game is the the people who play on multiplayer, if you are playing the defense you are accused of camping and people leave the game, and if you aren't careful to tell people a maximum number of light infantry they bring a full army of riflemen to a battle which ruins the experience, it makes the game a 'attempt to get close but then they just shoot you at their superior range then runaway' match which is awful. Play with friends and trustworthy people and remember to be offensive about other people's choice of country so it makes the match personal. All in all an insanely good game when played with the right people.
1690	1	a	Great game. I have played quite a lot of this game over the years and i have throughly enjoyed myself and still do, i always end up coming back to this game time and time again. The theatre system really helps to make your empire feel huge as it stretches several continents. The combat can get a bit boring at times when your troops just stand there exchanging fire but there is much more strategical depth to it then that. The variation of units isn't bad and with the DLC and mods there is a lot of unique units. I feel that this game has a lot of replayablity because every campaign is different and there are soo many different ways you can approach empire building, there is also a lot of depth into unit research which add new formations and equipment to you units which can change the way you play. This is one of my favorite games of all time, i definetly recommend this game if you have enjoyed any of the other total war games. But if you have played napoleon total war you might find some things lacking like having client states and less ship variation but having theatres really makes up for it in my opinion.
2258	0	a	It really sucks that they for some reason left out the campaign multiplayer.
4237	1	a	7/10  The only thing that holds it back is AI diplomacy that makes no sense. Otherwise a very engaging fun RTS
3187	1	a	If you were to throw together Civilization and a RTS game, this is what you would get. Defending cities from armies ten times your own, carefully planning an invasion of a city that is guarded by thousands of troops, all adds up into one hell of a fun time. Buy this game.
2517	1	a	An Aweome stratagy game, should be played more
3945	1	a	With Almost 1200 HOURS, I Think Its Safe For Me To Say I Would Recommend This Game To ANYONE; This Game Lets You Control Everything Under Campaign, And Is One Of The Best Graphics, You See Everything Down To The Thread Of The Soilders Shirt, And Campaign, You Control EVERYTHING&lt; as i said before &gt; I Give This Game 10/10, WAY BETTER THEN SHOGUN 2!!!!!!!!
4433	1	a	You will learn how to say: 'Yes', 'Ok', 'I will do it' and 'Attack', in basiclly any language.
2660	1	a	i love this game i recommend this to newcomers and fans of the series
3296	1	a	Awesome game &lt;3 multiplayer a must buy
49	1	a	Sometimes I almost feel bad for the orcs. Except, not really
859	1	a	It is rare that a game remembers what games are all about and remembers it the entire way through the game. Orcs Must Die! keeps its eye on the prize: fun. Every aspect of the game is designed around fun. Orcs exploding: fun. Death traps: fun. The player figuring their own ways through levels, not being restricted to a certain type of approach: fun. There's little in the way of plot, but just enough to keep it...fun. Until this game, I never felt the need to get every achievement just to eek out more playtime, but this game was good enough that I did so. It can be quite frustrating, but that mostly happens through challenges you make yourself - you don't have to 5 star every level, you don't have to play through nightmare mode, but you'll want to. It's a fantastic game that is just long enough, with just enough plot, to make every single section fun.
4510	1	a	Yes it has zombies, and yes it has pirates, what more does it need to be said? Well I haven't really finished the game, but I have put more than enough hours into this masterpiece, first you should know, this game has been made by 2 guys, which is very impressive. The game is basically an old school space game in a modern fashion, which adds nicely up. I can really recommend it, if you think it's too expensive, no worries, this game is quite often on sale. And if you fell in love with this game whilst reading my review, no worries! They're working on a sequel, which'll supposedly have co-op.
4418	1	a	One of the best Total war games
649	1	a	Great game for easy fun in first levels, challenging in later ones. Great action-strategy with absurd humor... What more can you ask for?
4643	1	a	I really enjoy this game. I'm normally one of those wimps who only plays on the easiest settings but this game only gets better the hard you make it. Max the bounty hunters and the difficulty level and you will enjoy the fight of your life.
406	1	a	Follow my curation :  http://store.steampowered.com/curator/9273374-exorio   Awesome single-player 'tower defense' (change 'tower' to 'trap'), very polished, balanced, real pure fun and very charming characters.
109	1	a	Like tower defense games? How about in third person? Also do you like killing lots of orcs? Well then Orcs Must Die is the game for you as it has all 3. It's a really fun and addictive third person tower shooter game with really good gadgets and varied and tough enemies. You get to be really creative with the defense using all the neat gadgets in your arsenal. Also, the A.I is good in this game. Overall, if you like tower defense games, you'll have plenty of fun times in this game.
3825	1	a	So far its fun and a bold design forward go total war keep marching on...
4617	1	a	A game about Space... Pirates and Zombies, what more could you want?! But in all seriousness this is a very good and enjoyable game. It brings back many good memories from my gaming-past. The graphics are very neat for a 2D game, there's humor and lots of finetuning options for your ships. High replayability and easy to start up and play for a short while and on the other hand you can also completely forget about time playing this game. Fell in love with this game during the tutorials.  Also the devs are actively talking with the community on both the steam forums and the official SPAZ forum.
3467	1	a	What differentiates a good game from a great game, is whether you find yourself reinstalling it years later; and despite its flaws, Empire: Total War manages to capture my imagination again and again. If you are a fan of the period, large scale battles filled with musket wielding infantry, cuirassiers, and bronze cannons, or immense wooden ship unleashing devastating broadsides on each other, you owe yourself to try this game. Add a mod like Darthmod, and you get an experience that no other strategy game managed to deliver up to this date. Unfortunately, despite the importance of diplomacy to 18th century politics, and the many factions that appear in Empire: TW, the game still lacks in that department, so if you're interested more in negotiations than in combat, there are better options in the market.
4997	1	a	The dialog is complete rubbish but eh game play is quite addictive.
3609	1	a	This game is â¥â¥â¥â¥ing amazing. The graphics are top notch (sea battles look â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ed amazing) and the gameplay is great as well.
1713	1	a	One of the best Total War games in my opinion. Great period, Large map and a decent variety of units.
3159	1	a	Best Muth â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥' game i've ever played biiiiiiiitch
1786	1	a	Love it - love the whole total war series!!
1466	1	a	Empire is one of the biggest Total War games you can get today. Spanning over about 1/3 of America, Europe and India.   Because of the huge scope you get a staggering 20+ factions in game minor and major nations. With a nice number of them been playable and with the hack or two you can play as them all.  The amount of nations means this is more of a challenge but the combat can be a bit stale. Unlike past game itâs all guns and odd melee combat as really, gun combat is simple with only a few tactics needed to give a clear victory.  This is the main down-turn of the game, the best part of the game has to be its small micromanagement system and upgrades for regions on the map and not in the city is a great addition, sometimes later in the game managing all this is hard but non the less rewarding to the dedicated player.  Huge map, plenty of factions and plenty of lands.  Downside: â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ diplomacy, a little bit overbearing for the average player. Stale combat.  Easily a 8.9/10
4941	1	a	Astoundingly good, and an absolute steal with the price point.  Screenshots and videos do not do this game justice - it is far far more than just arcadey space shooting. If you're looking for an indie game, I'd choose this one.
4657	1	a	A good game till the end im level 109 and still can't defeat the boss. The curve the games takes after act 2 is huge. Prepair for trying the same mission over and over till you quit and never come back. :(  edit Well I did come back and I worked on leveling all the way to level 139 and at that point i was able to take out the boss in 30 secounds. That felt so good! 75 hours is good for 7.99 a bit grindy but it was very fun.
4621	1	a	This game is still entertaining even after having it for this long!
4219	1	a	A very good game, has its flaws here and there. Overall good to play.
1246	1	a	Great game, highly recommended!
718	1	a	Best orc-slaying experience youÂ´ll get, besides the second part of course. Building traps and getting the best rating on the highest difficulty in every level got me quite some time but damn, worth it, so much fun!
4332	0	a	16,5gb of a game with dlcs, plays worse than Medieval. Much worse than Rome 1 or Shogun 2.  TL:DR: I don't know how anyone who played Rome 1/Shogun 2 could possibly recommend this.  Game is so clunky and broken in so many ways (cannons, walls, ships, results calculation, etc) that the only thing actually being good is advanced (?) trade.  Game is completely BORING to play, units upkeep costs are waaay to high (like seriously, this affects both player and AI).  AI is non-existant. Autoresolve can have your 5 units of charging cavalry loose agains two units of pure artillery. Or a fleet of sloop can loose against half a fleet of brigs. This happens. Graphics is extremely demanding for my pc, looking poorly, sometimes freezing when I select large unit stack etc.  AVOID!!
4922	1	a	Awesome top down RPG shooter in a huge galaxy. Now with bounty hunters AND zombies. Go buy!
607	1	a	Yes they must.
1220	1	a	iBomber Defense is about what you'd expect from a WWII themed tower defense game. Basic MG, Artillery, and AA emplacments are each designed to counter the stadard threats by land, air or sea. The maps can be challenging, particularly in areas where terrain prevents placement along likely paths, unfortunately, this isn't always obvious as occasionally open spaces will not allow placement. The campain mode is unfortunately linear, however, there will occasionally be 'defense' bonus levels, where you get to play a previous map with already placed towers and a nice purse to upgrade and expand from the get go. Although you'll be trying to defend against a more challenging string of attackers, extra 'action' points (for upgrading and expanding available defense options) will be easier come by  All in all, an easy game to pick up and put down whenever you get bored. It doesn't really stack up to some of the more dynamic tower defense games, but it gets the job done.
1149	1	a	Someone needs to give the team/person who worked on this version of Disciples 3 and give him the money he needs to finish the game properly. Dwarfs are missing, I know the history on how the developer went bankrupt and all, but here is an example of a team/person who knows how to develop this series. Sad that good franchises end this way. I hope someone will continue this one. Reincarnation is great, but could be much better if this would have been the first one out instead of the prior ones before this.  If you are new to the Disciples series get this one and not the others and you will enjoy it, well worth the current price. If you are a long time fan well it is not Disciples 2 but, as I you may come to like this version of Disciples 3. Worth the price to try and see.
2105	1	a	Going through the Total War games in order of release, I came upon a strange offspring of the series called Empire. Now mind you, in this review I will be describing both the game as it was released and patched over time, and I will cover a mod for this game that I am personally playing right now called DarthMod.  So, where to start wih this one? You are probably aware by now that the developers of the Total War series, Creative Assembly, have had somewhat of a disaster with their release of Rome 2 and have been patching it constantly ever since. From what I've read(not having played that game) most of the game breaking bugs and failures have been eliminated, but the game itself is still hardly a challenge because of the bad AI programming.  That is pretty much the case with this game, even after a substantial amount of time passed between release and me writing this. The game is still fun as hell, and there will on occasion be a challenging battle or siege where the AI might be competent. Also, the game tends to lag a lot in drawn out battles, even with a powerful processor. As I understand, this was the first game based on the Warscape engine and it seems that the devs at the time did not master it.These are some of the biggest gripes I have with this game, and there is a host of smaller ones. In any case, the game is flawed.  But underneath all the problems and bugs and flaws there is an incredibly engrossing and rich game which takes you to imperial era of the 18th century, giving you access to 3 strategic theaters to wage war, use subterfuge, develop your resources and loads of other activities. You will build powerful armies of infantry, cavalry and artillery with which to conquer, mighty fleets of warships to control the seas and protect your trade routes or raid your enemies. The naval battles are also a hell of a lot of fun once you get used to the wind mechanics and how to fire your cannons. I strongly recommend reading a guide on naval battles if you are unfamiliar with how sailing ships work.   All of this adds up to a very good, if inconsistent, experience. But you know what's better? Having a grand experience all the way through. If you are willing, check out DarthMod and possibly some of the submods for it. It makes the game what it was supposed to be from the start, improving the AI substantially and actually making almost every battle a real challenge. It doesn't fix some of the core game problems with the engine and due to improved graphics it can lag a bit on slower computers, but if you can run it, get it ASAP. Be warned though, it is tough. Campaign AI is much more aggressive and willing to maneuver to get what it wants, and the battle AI for naval battles will seem like Satan at first because of the maneuvers it pulls.  tl/dr: Great game, even better with mods.  
5272	1	a	A modern take on the classic Star Control. Nicely done, lots of ship building options and research paths. A bit grindy at times but a great game.
3381	1	a	one of the most combat realistice games ive played yet. and the viewing capability is amazing as well. would recomend to ANYONE who has steam
1521	1	a	I cry tears of joy just by looking at the title of the game
2661	1	a	Great game play it whenever I can
3285	1	a	Outstanding game! First time playing total war and it is incredible. Very detailed and strategic. Fighting on the open seas is a rush! This game nails it. I just wish I found it sooner. Try it, you will love it.
801	1	a	It's the kind of power fantasy your insecure â¥â¥â¥ could really use to help you get through the day! Buy it and feel like a man, manly woman, more manly mandroid, or other-gendered being with a sudden infusion of manity.
3887	1	a	Attacked France as America they ran 1776/10 would Murica stomp again
3714	0	a	I didn't like the direction the franchise went in. Feel like Rome Total War and Medieval were better games, and worked better with how the game was designed and evolved. I think a lot of these RTS games that gunpowder eventually harms the series more than it helps. Age of Empires suffered the same fate.   Not a bad game by any means, but its a system hog and really not worth it. Better off playing Medieval Total War, or Rome, or Shogun.
4570	1	a	I normally do not write reviews but i had to do it for this game.  SPAZ (Space Pirates And Zombies) is really a beautiful love letter to the old days of top down space shooters.  Pros: Stellar Presentation (hehe)    good 2d graphics    nice music    upgrades    ship fitting    challenges (bounty hunter)    different enemy types    even asteroid mining is fun    mutliple ships in your fleet    fun and diverse combat (lasers/cannons, fighter drones, cloaking, mines, rockets, bombs, boarding, ...)   Cons:    Can sometimes become a little bit grindy, but there are almost always ways around the grind.   Btw. I absolutely love TotalBiscuit (John Bain) as the narrator.  Buy it, play it, you won't regret it.
3707	1	a	one of the best games ive ever played as it made me think tactics and things are always changing  ive have a good miltary mind and one thing i liked was that the pirates had their own bases and their navys were just as big a threat as the other countrys
4016	1	a	Old game , but still new for me .
3186	1	a	Conquer the world as an 18th century civilization. This is the pinnacle of achievement for the Total War franchise.
461	1	a	
3501	1	a	hell yeah
1939	1	a	This game is awesome
1428	1	a	This is a great game , I enjoy to play as Russia , whit its Cossack infantry , and whit Austria , whit it s great hungarian husslers :)

4852	1	a	I really enjoy this game.
3879	1	a	Throughout the years there are very few games that stick out and remain replayable. This game is a splendid exception, even years after not playing Empire: Total War I still get the same joy out of every minute of play. I would recommend this to all gamers who enjoy the genre this game showcases, it doesa great job and continues to be a hit.
567	1	a	a damn good game that anyone who likes tower defense and/or FPS games should get, definetly in my all time top 10 games absolutly excellent, alot to do and a huge variety of traps and weapons to keep you amused for hours. only shortcoming is its only single players but then theres OMD2 so go get that aswell!!!!!
1271	0	a	I don't get this game... seriously. Why isn't there a proper tutorial ? I get the idea of moving to higher levels, and the fact that the higher you get the more enemies appear. But what do the power-ups mean ? How do I change weapons ? Can I even change weapons ? What's the best tactic ? How do I change an enemy from the inside ? And so on and so forth. This would've been a better game if things like that were explained properly. Also, the stylish retro graphics do make up for some of the game, but it just isn't enough. Let's hope the developer fixes some of my complaints in the near future.  [Rating: 66/100]
4117	1	a	Thumbs up, fantasy sucks!
1019	1	a	The most fun i've had playing a game in ages. Great for pick-up-and-play after a long day by just chunking orcs to bits, but the nightmare mode and leaderboard rankings actually require a lot of strategy and forethought. Have played it for countless hours (well, ok... 33 in two weeks) and have gotten 5 skulls on every level on NIGHTMARE... and that this is from a guy who can't even be bothered togo back and finish the last level in MGS4 because it would require fiddling around behind the TV to plug it in which should tell you all about how addictive and enjoyable it is.
5085	1	a	So. Much. Fun. This is classic space shooter/rpg, done really well. Takes a bit of time to ramp up, but you'll eventually find yourself commanding a fleet of ships doing battle with zombie-infested cruisers. If you've ever played Escape Velocity - this is the game for you.
3496	1	a	this game is a fun but it does have some down sides like i recomend playing this game on a good computer to get the best out of it.
3317	1	a	Its pretty good. The game could have been great, but they left some stuff horribly broken.. Sieges are broken for instance, ships can get stuck on trade nodes, etc..   Never really understood the point of the Agents either, they just seem to be put in the game to make the player less efficient.
1519	1	a	very reilistic and fun to play
1161	1	a	Having played Disciples II and all 3 versions of Disciples III, I have mixed feelings about Reincarnation. I prefer the larger arena's of Disciples Renaissance over the smaller Arena's in Reincarnation. The one advantage of small arenas is the battle seems more personal. The downside is in larger arenas you could have a couple small battles within the arena, and obstacles would have a greater impact. The dev's claim that Reincarnation's maps are more open. I don't agree, the maps seem even more cluttered. The only difference is you may have a shortcut path to cut across between 2 longer paths. The paths are still extremely linear. The seas ended up just being rivers and are as linear as you can get.  Reincarnation does have more settings that help to tailor the game to a player's preferences. An example is a setting to adjust attack animations within the arena. They have added some skills to the thief or fixed skills that didn't work correctly in previous versions. Certain arena skills are now triggered by critical hits or other events. This maybe helps the ai slightly but does not add any new strategy to combat.  The lighting and shadows are improved but then they decided to have the shadows rotate 90 degrees every 1/4 day. This begins to get annoying after 50 turns. I wish they would have had a feature to turn this off. Another design decision I don't like is that you can't zoom out as far on the worldmap as you could in Renaissance. To me, this makes the game feel less epic in scale. It also hints to the fact that this version really has no world map strategy to consider. You can only see about 7 move points out from your hero in any given direction.  If this had been my first version of D3, the graphics would have really impressed me. However, since I had already played 2 versions of the game, it was no surprise. Personally I don't think it any better than Renaissance. It has a different flavor, some new units. I feel Renaissance never got a fair shake because it was released essentially in beta state. Renaissance patched to 1.02 is as good in its own right as Reincarnation. I don't like that the dev's made 3 separate versions of the same game. It is because there are things I like better from each version, so when I play either one, I always miss something from the other version.   Reincarnation is not quite as moddable as previous versions as system files can not be modded.  Pros - New units include 5 new orc types, wild boar, and a few sea creatures.  - Stellar Graphics that aid in creating a totally immersive environment.  - Same campaign is slightly rewritten and takes place on new maps.  Cons - Tutorial is close to useless  - Still very linear maps even if they have a couple more shortcut paths  - You can usually take as many turns as you need before attacking difficult enemies.  
5317	1	a	The only game i'll happily play at 5 fps.

3463	1	a	I like this game, I sometimes don't understand why there is a lot of hate towards this game, I enjoy the locations, battles, graphics and the game frame of this game. On the otherhand there are a few bugs and errors which kind of ruin the game. An example of this would have to be how easily places you have captured will rebel, it is quite annoying to try and get world domination when you have every single area you own trying to rebel against you :/.
890	1	a	So much fun! Seriously, no â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ jokes, this is an excellent game that might be one of the most fun out there. Unique weapons, characters and it's also pretty funny.
1550	1	a	This game is great to starty out with to learn about Stratagy. Since its quite basic and its also very fun, it also teaches you money mangement of your empire so you will quickly defeat you enemys with economics and your Armys Strength. How ever the Naval in this game is quite strange but it can be fun with other players.
472	1	a	Grandslam Homerun for me. Tower Defense concept, humor, graphics, music, and sound are all top notch. I buy and try a lot of games -- this and Defense Grid 2 are far and away the best. Not even close. Other games are just dull right now.
2998	1	a	I was always scepticle about guns in total war, which napoleon total war backed up in its personally dissappointing gameplay/battles. However, thought id give empire a go and it has turned out to be one of (if not the best) total war of the series. This coming from someone who enjoys watching sword and spear clash in usual titles. Blown away by the graphics and depth the developers have gone (in terms of the map and locations) added with the usually great (minus napoleon) battle engine. Great Title, recommend anyone scepticle of Guns/line battles/general era (1700+) in total war to give this a try! you wont be dissapointed!
4378	1	a	Completed my first campaign it only took 230 hours! And still having a blast.
5197	1	a	Nice concept and execution! I like it!
1167	0	a	Great art work, story, music! More new units in this game! Also the developers did a great job in debug! Great! but..... Hard boring and wasting a lot of time upgrading soldiers! ur soldier must reach lvl 5 to achieve a higher tier, before lvl 5 ur soldiers are toys! save and reload! wasting a lot of time! u cannot enjoy a smooth game play and the story! the neutral units are blocking way everywhere and u cannot even beat them because ur toy soldiers are weak!!!! also, comptuer has greater chance to cause critical hit: kill ur soldiers in mere 1 hit!!! HAX! ( such as neutral unit Male Griffin: almost 100% critical hit is that fair??) i already said ur soldiers are toys, which means greater chance to [miss]! when fighting against neutral units! this game makes me disappointed! I am huge fun of disciples! Disciples 2 is epic, but well disciples 3 Reincarnatinon ....i have to say: hehe!! when i writing this i played 10+ hrs, but i am still at the beginning of the empire quest! i feel bored. i don't want to carry on! bored to death when upgrading my toy soldiers!  well i was pretty bested by the male griffins ( neutral unit )! dat almost 100% critcal hit and kill my toys with mere 1 hit! this game is so vicious that we have to reach lvl 5 to achieve a higher tier! and when u made it, guess what u will find ur precious skill points of ur toy soliders disappeared without a trace! r u kiding me? what do the developers want? wasting our time?? they seems so vicious to prolong the gameplay time by making some vicious design! i was a fun of disciples! i played Disciples from 1-3! but never saw a Disciples game so vicious like this!! u k wat i feel now! bored to death when upgrading my toy soliders! toys are toys! before lv 5 ur soldiers are toys! Pls nerf Male Griffin  Also i need to chill........i must be responsible for my review so i came to edit this when i am chilled down &lt;My wish for this game&gt; I am a huge fun of Disciples from 1 to 3, just cannot stop playing it! but on behalf of all funs these years i have to say developers pls make ur game more epic,( not ....u k wat i say)! pls don't prolong gameplay by doing that! guys u must fix it! otherwise no one will carry on because u bored them to death. if u want ppl to say u game is good, at least ur game must give ppl the great passion to keep on! pls try XCOM enemy unknown(2k games) and see the difference.... (try the new DLC enemy within) and tell me which game give u a better feeling to keep on??  IF it is not the end, i think the developers are planning to make a new DLC: Return of the mountain clans!!! If not this game has not ended!
2938	1	a	With having over 1200 recorded hours, this game is awesome is undoubtibly my most favorite game I've ever played.
486	1	a	Great Game!!
4051	1	a	Amazing game! I would give it a 5/5 it is a amazing game thanks sega!  
1997	1	a	actually a really fun game, despite being a bit old.
5335	1	a	Want to survive a hostile island full of haters?  You can do that.  Want a to survive a zombie apocalypse?  You can do that.  Want to scavenge for weapons and battle each other and be the best?  You can do that.  Want to run a small guerrilla army and take over Altis?  You can do that.  Like to role play island life?  You can do that.  Want to create lots cool scenarios?  You can do that.  Want to snipe your enemies or fight a conventional war?  You can do that.  Want to fart rainbows and ride a unicorn with a laser cannon horn?  Maybe one day we'll have that.
1401	1	a	Ejoyable, hours of campaign but also some great multiplayer action!  10/10
2528	1	a	Empire: Total War is one of the best strategy game I have ever played. You can play on a a turn-by-turn campaign map as a major imperial faction in the 18th century. You may expand cities, establish trade routes, manage taxes, and so many other things to do. Should you need to fight the enemy, you could autoresolve the conflict or you cold go into real-time to use cunning tactics and force to defeat your enemy. The same applies to naval battles. You can command realistic 18th century ships on the high seas. You can also play through the Road to Independence, a historical campaign from Jamestown, to the French-Indian War, to the American Revolutionary, and finally to establishing America as a real nation. I highly recommend this game to strategy gamers and fans of the 18th century.
5260	1	a	Absolutely loving this game. Reminds me in a way of an old Macintosh game that I loved called Escape Velocity, but they didn't have ZoMbIeS!!!! Great game guys, can NOT wait until the second comes out!!!!
19	1	a	  5 out of 5
2400	1	a	Good title of sega, there are a lots of units and naval battles. I think that Empire Total War is the best Total war game.
2576	1	a	Amazing addition to the Total War series. Great turn based strategy game and love the political elements. The battles are amazing to watch high quality and strategy plays a huge role, more so than in past games in my opinion with the addition of firearms being the main weapons at work here. Awesome construction system and economic development system easy to pick-up had trouble my first two campaigns then started to get a feel for the game. I was awful at Shogun, but if you're intelligent and can learn how to work around your weaknesses it is a great buy at this price. Fun for a quick play or a long period of time. If you are into this type of game you know who you are and I would say buy it! 9/10 for the genre overall probably a 7/10 since it doesn't appeal to everyone. GREAT DEAL!!!
4726	1	a	This game is highly addictive, I've been caught playing this in the office a few times. And yes because of the low pc requirements, I've been able to sneak in some playtime of this game. Give it a spin if you see it in a free weekend/steam sale, I can guarantee that you'll have a blast with it.
2247	1	a	The FitnessGramâ¢ Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly, but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal. [beep] A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound. [ding] Remember to run in a straight line, and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark, get ready, start. 
266	0	a	Life is too short, Don't waste it.
2315	1	a	This games so great i spent much of my life on this game i wish diplomacy was like dimocracey 3 more diplomatic options is my complaint for this game
3917	1	a	I have mixed feelings about this game and its sequel, Napoleon.  On the one hand, they explore a time period (1700-1815) that's sadly neglected in games. It's a rich and fascinating epoch that includes the rise and fall of huge empires, the first global conflicts like the Seven Years War, the intellectual and cultural revolution of the Enlightenment, the shift from an age of highly-regulated 'limited warfare' to massive armies based on conscription, the birth of the United States, the French Revolution, and so on. ETW spans the entire 18th century, and had the potential to be a grand-scale masterpiece.  In some ways, it delivers on that promise, especially with the help of mods (Darthmod is an absolute must). It has a huge campaign map that spans three continents, naval battles, land battles with thousands of infantrymen slugging it out to the accompaniment of artillery fire and cavalry charges, streamlined diplomacy, and a complex tech tree. Wars in ETW have a distinctly 18th-century flavor to them: colonial conflicts turn into battles for global mastery, while coalitions of great powers form intricate webs of alliances. The modded AI puts up a good fight, and will take over your colonies and wreck your trade if you're not careful.  But the world in Empire and Napoleon just doesn't feel as vibrant and alive as it did in Rome 1 and Medieval 2, which preceded ETW. In Medieval 2, your faction leader and his/her heirs were playable characters, as were merchants, diplomats, assassins, priests, and so on. There were crusades, marriages, heretics, and the Pope to worry about, and managing your settlements had some real depth to it. Each faction felt unique thanks to the voice-acting and a rich variety of specialty units. There were world-changing events like the Mongol invasion and bubonic plague.  Most of that is gone in Empire. Your faction leaders are almost invisible, relegated to a 'Government' screen, and only give some abstract bonuses to things like unit upkeep. Diplomats, merchants, and settlement-building have been pretty much 'streamlined' out of the game entirely. There are no game-changing events like the Roman Civil War or the Mongol Invasion to liven things up in the midgame.   Factions feel identical. It doesn't matter if you're playing as Prussia, France, the Ottoman Empire, or Great Britain; all factions have the same units (line infantry and a few flavors of cavalry and artillery), without any real strengths or weaknesses. The only difference is your starting position.  Maybe the biggest letdown is the impact technologies have on your faction. I think it would have been brilliant move to have industrial and Enlightenment advances give you economic boosts at the expense of public order (workers' uprisings / strikes, upper-class coups and revolutions). After all, this is what happened in history. But instead, the 'clamor for reform' penalties are so slight as to hardly make a difference. Researching Fire by Rank makes a bigger impact on the game than Utilitarianism or The Rights of Man, or industrial technology that would have destroyed older crafts or uprooted peasants.  ETW also does nothing to model the historical problems faced by huge empires of the time. Constant wars and over-expansion are encouraged; there's no penalties on public order as long as you're winning. In reality, though, even a successful 18th-century war could leave a nation spent and destabilized: the American Revolution was caused by the costs of Britain's victory in the Seven Years' War, and in turn the French Revolution was caused in part by the costs of aid to the United States. It would've been great to see a risk/reward factor in place - expand at the risk of uprisings at home and abroad. This could have led to a more elastic mid/late game, and would have added an extra dimension to strategy. In Medieval and Rome, you really feel like you're traversing an entire era of human history; in Empire, a hundred years pass, but the world hardly seems to change at all.  Finally, ETW and Napoleon both lack some of the extra polish and flavor that earlier games had. Unmodded, the soundtrack is dull and repetitive. The lack of period music is just baffling to me, and the voice acting is stale and leaves much to be desired. Factions, units, and settlements feel copy-pasted; it's all the same, just with slightly different coats of paint. And even though the battles feel authentic, both games have a toy soldier vibe to them; they lack the grit and brutality of the other entries in the series.  After several hundred hours, both Empire and Napoleon feel like a letdown. They're not bad at all, and they're worth playing just for a chance to explore a neglected historical period. But every time I play them, I can't shake the regret that they could have been so much more.
3542	1	a	love this game
3704	1	a	like all total war games its the best
2308	1	a	Good game, very different from the other total war games in that the frequent and neccesary use of firearms changes tactics dramatically
2018	1	a	Carlos II is the most bested man to have ever ruled spain. His inbread-holyness just acompanies him through life and lets him rule the world. I mean come on this guys father was his aunts sisters brothers fathers daughter! Simple right? From Iceland to Persia, From India to America, this is the man you want ruling your country. Nothing says 'Man this guy is hot' than drooling, which is another great characteristic about Carlos II. Carlos II gets all the countries on his side with -20 to diplomatic relations of european countries, this guy is like a grown child! The -2 prestige per turn also lets you be the last country on the Greatest Countries Ever leader board. I mean this guy is a FREAK OF NATURE! Who wouldnt want this guy? This guy also has a bad case of raving. You havent heard of raving? Lemme get my  urbandictionary.com  real quick oh yea Raving: talk wildly or incoherently, as if one were delirious or insane. Yep thats carlos for ya. Welp I hope this tells you how much Carlos II really matters in this game. Come on say it with me, CARLOS II FOR WORLD SUPREME LEADER!
5082	1	a	Such a fun game with a unique idea. And space, who doesn't love space.
4560	1	a	Fun, but gets to be a bit of a grind at parts, especially if bounty hunters are enabled.  Overall, a challanging, fun game that runs really well even on lower-spec computers like mine.
171	1	a	One of the most fun tower defense games I have ever played! The controls are perfect, the humor is spot on, the character animations reek with personality, there's lots of replayability if you want to get the highest scores and ratings per stage, the story is hilarious and the soundtrack is absolutely amazing! What also makes a great tower defense game is freedom in how you accomplish your goal. This game definitely leaves room for success via various strategies. Definitely a must buy!
4211	1	a	I enjoyed the game despite the Ai being rubbish.
5278	1	a	its a kick A$$ game while i not visited al teh planets yest one cane say it half the fun is getting there
3233	1	a	Fantatic! It make me happy.
2565	1	a	a continuation of the Total War games, you play as one of the world powers in 3 theatres of war, Europe, America and India during the time of Elizabeth II and the American Civil War. Will you put down the War for Independence or conquer the world as one of the civilizations?
527	1	a	Def a game I would recommend getting if you like RTS.
3968	1	a	Very good software. I use each time I need doccument for work.
977	1	a	Funny, nice visuals and satisfying combat and trap setting.
819	1	a	Highly addicting game that feels part RPG, part tower defense. Fully recommended!
3535	1	a	why do you not have this game yet????????? It is the best strategy game to date in my opinion. Working with historical empires and during the times of the 1700's, you know your in for a treat. The 1700's was a time of war everywhere, especially against Britain and France for the fight for North America. Known as the French and Indian war (from a British/American perspective). This is probably the most amazing time period in the history of time, so many things happened in this time. The French and Indian, the America Revolution, The French Revolution and more than I know probably. This game has great DLC, mods and gameplay in general. If you don't have any of the Total War series in your steam library, you need to re-evaluate your gaming life.
1334	1	a	Won a battle against 200 Natives with one artilery unit.   10/10 would assert European supremacy over inferior natives again.
4266	1	a	i just killed everyone, it worked, Pax Americana.
3860	1	a	my favorite total war by far, all the different campaigns present different challenges and the agents have just the right influence on the game. very addictive for the military strategist.
4996	1	a	awsome game
4251	1	a	Really good game if you like the domination kind of games, but this takes that to a whole new level with diplomacy, territorial expansion and interactive battles that are realistic, the only downside is the games ai start to go crazy with diplomacy once you reach past the 1800's mark, but still good game
3151	1	a	This is a pritty good game i love games like these and plz keep makeing more game
2629	1	a	It isa complicated at first but it is fun. once you start to get it it becomes an challenge to do better. Overall once you get to handle it is the best game in the total war universe from my experience.
5196	1	a	Its a great game. I beat it the first time on a small map in about 40 hours. That is a small map. 40 hours in a game is well worth the money but throw in the replayability of this game and youve got a great little time killer on your hands that has a lot of potential for expansion.    I'd give this game a 8/10 which is high for me. I'd love to see the customization of ships expanded and maybe a little more control on the AI of your fleet. but other than that, its a quality game.
2656	1	a	Of all the Total War games, including the ones that came out after (Shogun, Rome 2, Atilla, Napoleon) this is arguably my favorite and I continually come back to it.  A good mix of technology research, trade domination, diplomacy, underhanded tactics, and the raw brute strength of regiments of men marching across three continents creates a broad sweeping game in the hey-day of the European race to Empire. With the great addition of the Warpath campaign, this game gets even better.  It is mostly mod friendly, and the American Campaign acts as a good tutorial.  The only thing negative I can say about this game is that it would be nice to play and start out as the fledgling United States or British Colonies. The closest you can get is starting out as Britain itself.
108	1	a	Orcs Must Die! is third person a hilarious sit-game-com settled in fantasy medieval theme.  Technically:    the game is a fantasy / medievial 'tower' defence + third person 'shoot everything that survived trap lines',    30 traps, spells and weapons (total), mostly upgradable    20 (24?) levels to beat + a few in DLC, approx 10h of gameplay,    nightmare difficulty, another 10h of gameplay,    challanges - max score per level - 5-10h,   Gameplay notes:    The difficulty per wave grows with number and setup of enemies, and shrinking space for traps,     The enemies do not seem to have increased HP per wave,    Most of levels are balanced so that the Mage needs both traps, spells and wepons to hold the line,    Weapons require item slot, there are two in the game: sniping crossbow and melee blade staff,    Spells require equipment slots and to use in the mission and mana to cast,    Defender minions require item slot, and gold to place them,    During a level the Mage can buy upgrade from one of three 'weavers': generic trap upgrade, spell upgrade, mixed upgrade.    Traps cannot be directly upgraded during the level. They can be upgraded during the story.    Some levels have two or more distanced attack paths, of which at least one must be fully secured with traps,    No endless mode (can be found in OMD!2),    It is possible to replay old levels with improved trap set for better score.    All of the characters are stereotypic to the point of lunacy.    The main hero, 'The Warmage' is a young, dumb lad. Blindly convinced of his own awesomeness. He needs to prevent orcs from enering portals to our world (at which he is good)... and to figure out (at which he is terribly bad) a more permament solution.     His (former) Master shows up in the story by his memories. He was the last (failed) hope for the world, spare his student, but the only thing greater then his apprentice's ignorance, is his stupidity.    The Sorceress (the prime enemy in the game), does not show up directly, but magically takes quarrels with the Warmage.    Most of her arguments are attempts to insult the Warmage so that he can't figure that out (which is not that hard afterall). Most of Warmage's speech are (futile) attempts flirt up the Sorceress, and show that he is the most handsome and awesome man in the area (which if of course true, as he is the only one).    The orcs are main competitors for the price for The Best Cannon Fodder in video games: dumb, ugly, run and die in hundreds, have hilarious (though still dumb) speach lines, can be headshot-ed.   General info    OMD is settled in medieval-themed bastions / castle / dungeons. There is only one level theme.    Forget about cinematics. The storyline is presended via semi-animated drawings. This is a great idea and fits great into the game.    The orcs, the Warmage and the traps have a bit grotesque, comic design. Again, this suits the overall game mood, and slows down graphics 'aging'.    Amazing music. If you run into game OST, do buy it. I managed to get one from Humble Bundle.   Any problems?    Trap balance - some traps are simply better, some are just useless (Hint: use traps with large AOE and fast or no reload),    Since trap upgrades are permament, The Warmage usually sticks with favourite set with little room for experiment.    No co-op game (solved in OMD2)    The super-arogant hero can be hard to get used to. The humor can be sometimes percieved as primitive.    High emphasise placed on combat, it is not possible / extremly difficult to play only with the economy.    First two levels in nightmate are... too nightmareish, the difficulty seems to be easier further.    there are two levels in the game (including final), which must be simply learnt and played by hearth. In each wave the  Mage must build traps in particular area, buy a proper upgrade and solo secure another corridor.  Mispacing traps will leave the attacked corridor unsecured.     Strong sides    humor,    nice character design,    good overall ballance in map design,    good balance of strategic / economic components in gameplay (unless you don't like action in tower defences),    interesting maps,    high 'replayablity', level score to be maxed.   You should avoid the game, if you:    dislike action in tower defence and prefer them to be purely economic,    dislike arrogant and dumb protagonists   Do play if:    don't mind thinking / action hybrid,    look for a lot of fun,    tend to max each level  
1919	1	a	This game is awesome i have over 1000 play hours in just 1 year on it
3358	1	a	Probably one of the best RTS games in the entire genre. I defenitly recommend this game 100% to anyone that has an interest in turn-based RTS games, or an interest in the 18th Century! I've played over a thousand hours on this game and I still haven't lost interest yet!
2119	1	a	This is hands down the best total war game of all time.  Naval battles are amazing (â¥â¥â¥â¥ the haters) cruising with a fleet with first rates and epic naval battles is all you could hope for in a total war game; smoke, fire explosions - true epicness. The melee units on the game however like calvalry are fairly disappointing but having cannons, mortars and ranks upon ranks of infantry makes the games land battles superb.  The campaign map is nothing special but the feeling you get from building a vast empire is un rivaled by other total wars   Deffiantly buy this game, brilliant.
1048	1	a	A great time consumer! Poor Orcs... Not! :) +like this game
1492	1	a	As the Total War Series free weekend comes to a close, I would like to recommend Total War: Empire, not only is it another great total war game, there is much more focus patience and strategy, than there is in the older games, with there more aggressive style. Keep in mind, this is all just my opinion based on how I played these games, however like any of the Total War games, each one is different enough that it would take you actually playing them all to know what one you like most!
200	1	a	This game is so much fun, a combination of tactics and action that combines pretty well.   8/10
762	1	a	Tower defense with strategy. Rather, it's strategy using tower defense. The 'towers' aren't so much towers as they are traps. Oil traps, impaling traps, arrow traps, launcher traps, and so on. Set them up at the right spots, and watch the orcs go flying back the way they came, or dying on the spot.  Oh, and don't forget to listen to what they say while you're killing them, or what your character says while he's killing them. That's always amusing.
1620	1	a	Wide spanning campaign. If you are willing to forgive the average AI, you'll spend a lot of time forging your empire, and destroying others'
3511	1	a	I have a hard time adapting from quick RTS's like Company of Heroes and Age of Empires to games like this with extremely long drawn out battles, but if that's your thing then this game would suit you.
3202	1	a	I have loved the Total War series since the first Rome, but Empire has to be my most favorite of the series. I have played this game over and over, and it has never disappointed me yet. Some friends have remarked to me that they did not enjoy the complexity of the game. However for me, that was one of the most interesting features offered by Empire. For some all the options may feel a bit daunting, but if you truly delve into everything this game has to offer, I am confident you will find it strategically and tactically interesting of all the Total War titles.
2760	1	a	Best of them all.
343	1	a	Very addictive I love it !
2049	0	a	Absolute Garbage!  Even still after being out for like 6 years the game still lacks any resemblence of a good game. Without mods the AI is completely brain dead. Just throws legions of militia and pikemen into gun fire. Diplomacy is probably mentally â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ as for some reason everyone and their grandma declares war on you for no â¥â¥â¥â¥ing reason. It goes from friendly realtions to â¥â¥â¥â¥ you without a single warning or reason. Public order prevents you from â¥â¥â¥â¥ing doing anything as they revolt instantly if they are unhappy. Nothing to be desired, the gameplay is at least cool being the few games the feature 18th century warfare.
4449	1	a	I made women hunt and cut trees, while men worked at the farm.  10/10
524	1	a	 Spike reviews his 100%-ed games    In one sentenceâ¦

1183	1	a	I love the Disciples series but initially avoided the multiple iterations Disciples 3 due to all of the negative reviews and confusion. Even after researching this particular iteration of Disciples 3, 'Reincarnation', I was skeptical but decided to buy it anyway -- and I am glad I did! This is the best version of Disciples I have ever played, an elegant blend of original Disciples dark themes, stylistic artwork and dramatic music with the more tactical 'Heroes of Might and Magic' or King's Bounty' series. If you liked either of those series or previous Disciples games you should check this one out, it is the best of all worlds.
2320	1	a	If you're an AP Euro alumnus like myself, you'll be astonished by how this game resembles the McKay, Hill, Buckler textbook 'A History of Western Society (Volume 9)'. You'll be met by visuals only surpassed by the Exploring Art sections of the McKay, Hill, Buckler textbook 'A History of Western Society (Volume 9)' and you will be surprised to find extraordinary Far Eastern and Far Western realms to explore and conquer. I could say much more about this magnificent game but I must return to my studies and work on obtaining my artium doctor (Doctor of the Arts) at NWTC.
1113	1	a	This game ts like Dungeon Defenders but i kinda consider this game much better since you have the ability to place traps pretty much anywhere (ceiling, walls, and floors).   What this game dosent have though is co-op and can make the game quite boring after awhile of playing it...still fun though...  you also can't remap the controls for this game  ---My Rating--- 7.3/10
3074	1	a	Empire is my all-time Total War favorite after the CA fixed the early bugs. The game is mostly well-balanced, the firearms bring an extra dimension (tactical combat phase isn't just mindless melee) and the three theatres (Europe, India, Americas) provide varied approaches to the Grand Strategy. Exchanging broadsides in naval combat is also very well done.  18th century is well represented and the different units (line and light infantry, light and heavy cavalry, dragoons, cannons, howitzers etc.) are interesting. You can play as a historical European superpower like France, Prussia, Austria, Sweden or Poland-Lithuania or choose the Ottoman Empire or the India-based Marathas. The United States has her own campaign, as well as the Native Americans. Regarding the learning curve for new players, this isn't a walk in the park but not a minute-detail micromanagement hell either.  Only serious downsides are that the AI and unit pathfinding are at times bit lacking but otherwise this is a very engaging and entertaining game. Highly recommended.  I nominated this game for the 'Office Chair General Award' in 2016 Steam Awards as it is in my opinion the most satisfying world conquest game ever for us basement napoleons/caesars.
3161	1	a	a great game with many mods and gameplay to last for long time
3967	1	a	Buy dis shizz now !!!!
264	0	a	Felt like this was more of a game to be played on my Smartphone then PC.  
5024	1	a	All the fun of a top-down space shooter and RPG. Very reminiscent of Star Control II in many ways. Fun strategy and great battle and upgrade options. Story is OK - but like many RPG's, can get a little repetetive and straightforward.
5233	1	a	Does what it aims to accomplish, does an alright job. A little too much detail, bogs down progression. But it was fun!
711	1	a	A very good game,nice visuals,great soundtrack!
813	1	a	Quite fun game of a first person shooter/tower defense hybrid, and lots of possible combinations for causing mayhem!
3352	1	a	awesome game love it
2736	0	a	by far one of the worst total war games i have ever tried
4442	1	a	An old classic that i have always enjoyed. There are many nations to play, each with their own special units. a real time stradegy game where you upgrade through the ages, offering better units and upgrades. You can fight with humans or with computer players. The best part of the game by far is the battles. Huge battles with infantry, calvary and cannons, War will be every where and dead bodies will rittle the bafflefied. A must play if you like RTS games
2292	0	a	What. The. $##%? Come on Total War. I am sick of this trash. Empire: Total War is a terrible ripoff of Sid Meier's Civilization franchise. They even cost the same amount (I think). Don't even think of getting this game just go get Sid Meier's Civ V. Please for the love of (no god because I am an athiest) don't get this game!! Final Verdict: 4/10 Below Average.    12/27/16 Update: The final verdict is finnaly decided a 1 OUT OF A â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ 100000. NO LIES THIS GAME IS AN INSULT TO ALL TOTAL WAR AND SRATEGY GAMES EVER. PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS GAME EVEN IF IT BECOMES FREE OR A REALLY GOOD DEAL. FOR YOUR SAKE DON'T BUY IT.    P.S To all commenters what i mean by Civ 5 is ANY â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ CIV GAME EVER you mentally challenged fools.
1045	1	a	Extremely fun and well polished game. Must have for any Tower Defence player who also enjoys being in the thick of the action.
4976	1	a	A neat little space arena that brings back distant memories of Subspace. Probably worth buying only because there's virtually no competition in the genre. It can be frustrating not being able to zoom out more when you're being shot off-screen, and the drawn graphics such as pilot avatars and Civ relations come off as very sloppy when I think they were going for charming.   The main story gets monotonous because you don't choose to grind if you want better tech, you HAVE to grind for better tech. But the gameplay does get a breath of fresh air when you start to battle zombies and build up your uninfected armada. But the real draw is the core gameplay of top-down, space dog-fighting. Taking out an enemy ship on your own is very rewarding and subsequently, being killed will have you cursing under your breath.   If you're a masochist like me, there's worse ways to spend three bucks. Plus, it's easy to tell that the devs could do a lot with a little more funding.   
4491	1	a	Extreamly complex space fleet management. SPAZ is basically FTL meets Mount and Blade. The action feels like an addicting top-down space-shooter. This game is not for casual gamers. It can be a bit overwhelming but if you stick with it SPAZ can be quite a rewarding experaince.
902	1	a	Fast paced, arcade-y yet surprisingly deep tactical game play. This is 1 to keep.
1653	1	a	Realy good game...get it today!
2785	1	a	Maybe one of the total war games that failed, but i reallt thind this game should get a positive review plus if you are bored of the old empire total war. Just download darthmod. :)
4541	1	a	Pretty good cheap game. Reminds me of FTL, but it has a longer life. If its in a sale, its a good buy :)
1134	1	a	The Orcs jut nedz moar dakka WWWAAARRRGGG!!!!
4756	1	a	I traded a GayMod steam gift for this game and let me tell you that it was well worth it.  This game is sort of like an online game i've played for like 7 years: Darkorbit except that spaz is a singleplayer game unlike darkorbit, in darkorbit you are overwhelmed by cheaters left and right.   What i like about the game:  - Really RPG like, i LOVE RPG's - You have to plan out a strategy before you go guns ablazin or else you'll end up mining for rez for the next half hour to repair you're fleet - Doesn't take me 5 hours to beat the game, i can see myself sinking 20+ hours into this game   What i don't like about the game:  - Low amount and repetitive missions - Not much to do except whoop some â¥â¥â¥ and mine rez - The solar system is BIG but not big enough, WE NEED BIGGER!!!!! - Small amount of ship classes you can choose from - Small amount of weapons you can choose from   Other thoughts:  It'll be REALLY cool if you could upgrade you're weapons for example, having a level 1 mining lazer and paying to get it to level 2 so it might be 1% faster or have a longer burst. Over all this is a REALLY fun game, highly recommend it.
2287	0	a	I like how this game portrays the Native American Indians as dangerous bad guys, and the white colonialists as the good guys ...  As someone who has played all the Total War games, it really is disgusting all the racial stereotypes and biased representation of history.  Not to mention the gameplay where all non western factions are usually nerfed, and come in cheap, weak blob/zerg spam units.
3148	1	a	As the somehow perfectly in control ruler of your pick of 18th century civilisations, the player will find that attempting to advance towards your countries goals (i assume they are determined by the actual colonial actions of these nations at the time) will make you exactly public enemy no. 1 as diplomatic relations tend to break down rather fast... with everyone at the slightest mention of Imperialist Expansion... even though the aim of the game is to expand .. imperially, seems counterproductive. Research is a must, once riflemen are achieved and manufactured en masse, absolutely no-one in india or in the Americas has any chance against these accurate fast-reloading geniuses and their ability to place explosives and stakes in the ground.  This game is very replayable, heavy in the fun factor and overall extremely enjoyable.  Played as Russian Empire, and after expanding down to Egypts border and rolling over sweden and conquering italy and germany I noticed that trade wasn't even happening anymore as everyone hates me, quickly enacted a revolution and decapitated the monarch's head while reforming into the glorious Russian Republic because technological research is badly hurt when attempting to play as an autocrat. I built thousands of farms and fishing ports and my economy was back on track, but i had lost syria and iran while i dillydallied. Religion is so annoying to manage in the game, making everyone Russian Orthodox was dangerous but it fixed everything when it finally happened. I found much hilarity and satisfaction in negotiating with unsuccessfully and progressively steamrolling Europe.  This game is a must for people like me!
2650	1	a	the game is fun while not the best in the whole franchise its easy to pick up and play except for the ship battles those are confusing along with some it loking like its runing off of a ps2
93	1	a	Horrendously good fun. My main grievance is that the Warmage (the protagonist) is a complete idiot and the game takes every opportunity to beat you over the head with that fact. Fortunately you can mute the game so you don't have to listen to him. Another small issue I had was that there are occasionally little nuggets of exposition during the game, but you can barely hear them over the sound of orc giblets spraying across the level.  Putting those issues aside the game rewards you with an army of orcs and associates to slaughter your way through with a variety of pokey, burny, zappy and crushy things. The score system gives you an incentive to go back to earlier levels with your new toys and make orcs die in new and interesting ways. You can approach each level in a variety of ways, so if you prefer setting up a death alley and watching the carnage from afar you can do so. But if you prefer getting up close and personal with a blade whilst a tar pit slows your enemies down, that's a valid option. Later in the game you unlock 'Weavers', giving you mid-game temporary upgrades for your traps and skills which add to the number of strategies you can use.  I didn't have any technical issues with the game although on an older machine the game did slow down a little when a lot of enemies were around, but otherwise it runs well.  Overall I'd recommend it to tower defense fanatics as well as action or strategy game fans.
5166	1	a	Extremely addictive and fun game. Very well done and polished as well. This is one superb indie title.
1982	0	a	i love this but its unplable due to bugs
46	1	a	Hours of orc-killing fun.
1201	0	a	Few tings WHY not to buy this game.  1. This is NOT Disciples anymore.  It's just another sh*tty Heores clone. Balance is re-done according to 'chessboard' change, and - not really recalculated properly. Now it sucks.  Where's the WHOLE F*CKING IDEA OF A CHESSBOARD WITH ONLY 6 SLOTS GODDAMIT???? The one, that was building up the whole gameplay you know, the one htat was requiring for you to calculate your army carefully, and use every single possibility to overcome your opponent? And what's with these special spots on the battlefield?  I mean, comoooooon... Shoot me at least 2 differences from heroes? Can you? Different sprites??? Or Uglier GUI??? Jeesus, Disciples was one of the BEST, and from my perspective - mainly because of this unique and interesting balance idea of a chessboard.  Now - disciples has nothing to offer except a bug reports, and ugly... graphics. And really poor storyline of course too.    2. Akella, aaaah Akella...  The WORST releaser in the world keeps up with it's own 'fame'...  I am trying to get trough first level of Demons for a f*cking week already...  Crashes ALL the time. From my previous experience of communicating with them about some crashes - it just do not work. They *usualy* just don't give a â¥â¥â¥â¥ about customer.  I really do not remember even single 'OK' release by that company, not to speak of 'Good' ones.  If only I would take care and read about that they are involved BEFORE I bought this game - I simply wouldn't. It's sooo obvious, that if the game is marked by that publisher - it just wouldn't work.
3963	1	a	Played as Maratha, after reconquering all of India I sailed 7 huge armies to Britain in 7 tiny trade ships. And then I proceeded to pillage it repeatedly until Britain was in Venice.  10/10 would take revenge on dem arrogant genocide monkeys for historical reasons again.
276	0	a	â Nice TPS Defence Trap concept â Good price (2â¬) in Biedronka Store  â Only WSAD â No Tutorial â More shooter then Defence Tower â Sanctum series are much much better then this one â Very difficult
4851	1	a	Dumb amounts of fun.
2917	1	a	10/10 Would invade Europe as USA Again.
3986	1	a	over all this game has great gameplay, you must manage economy, plan land and sea battles, and have fun. something missing is an AI for sea battles, sea battles are terrible in this game, you can tell your ships to pursue and enemy ship and all they will do is start turning trying to find a path while the enemy ship constantly bombards you, land battles though, are amazing, real military strategy can be employed for results. the games politics menus could be better but they are satisfactory. this game has definitely been worth buying.
2924	1	a	This game is bretty gud. I can shoot swedes and russians with a musket or cannon. -Finn 
5290	1	a	This game is amazing, i love it. It reminds me of an old game called solar winds. 10/10
2197	0	a	Freezes up after a few hours, after searching the web found out extended games are impossible because other nations will get too big and freeze the AI or something. Not cool.
5139	1	a	I think they absolutely nailed the combat in the game, any grind-fan will love this kind of combat. Those that don't like grind, dont buy the game. For the rest go for it when it's on a sale or something. There also is some replayability for those that like that.  Also, don't buy it for the story as it is 100% cheesy.
1282	1	a	This is a fun little game to just relax with for a while. Not much meat on the bones, but worth it over time
946	1	a	great game
3068	1	a	This game should have gotten more love from the developer before initial release, but overall it is quite good and with modders around it's bound to get better.
4502	1	a	At first I couldn't stand this game because the controls/ui were a little cryptic and 'home made'. But once you get past that stuff there are some really good mechanics at the core. The way the game occurs on different 'scales' helps this space game not feel so empty (as many space games so often do).  At a large-scale, you are making choices about which system to go to and juggling faction reputation to gain all-important research.  At a mid-scale you are trying to build a diverse set of ships that can deal shield and hull damange.  And at a small-scale you are working with positioning and ship crews to gain an edge in fights.  All-around, an interesting take on the ARPG, and something you should at least consider buying.
2762	0	a	I love this game. It is one of my favorites. It now crashes a lot &amp; I can't stand playing it. I tried all the fixes that have been suggested to others to no avail.
1873	1	a	Great game
2144	1	a	Worth it, im not very good at the sea battles, but the rest of the game is awesome.
3546	1	a	This game is great, the gameplay is spot on, and the game's controls are great!
1978	1	a	One of the best strategy games in history and arguably the best Total Warâ¢ game. This game is a masterpiece. Great gameplay and graphics. Buy it, you won't regret it!
525	1	a	Great fun. I enjoy the main character's wisecracks. And slicing, dicing, skewering, burning, flinging, and exploding Orcs never gets dull!
217	1	a	Its actually not bad
1341	1	a	This game is as addicting as it is nuanced. It is a turn-based strategy game much like Civilization, but it is far more detailed (it is even more detailed than the previous Total War games that I love such as Medieval or Rome). As a history buff, I also enjoy the fact that I can play as an 18th century power and I will get a message pop up at the start of a turn (in the appropriate year) detailing a major happening of that year in history (like the discovery of Hydrogen or Oxygen, of the first female soldier in the British Army, etcâ¦).
1467	1	a	This game is for does who wants to feel the power of the European colonial period. The battels are very good.
758	1	a	Orcs Must Die. Just Orcs Must Die. This game got me hooked since the moment I put a feet on the world of rifts, as the successor of the 'Old Man'. The different waves of orcs and different abilities you get after each level encourages playing, the graphics are amazing, the music is epic and I think I found one of my favorite all-time games. Can't wait to play the sequel. 9.5/10
4006	1	a	A very good stratigic game for thinkers and fighters!
3491	1	a	Empire Total War is an interesting member of the Total War series. It has both positive and negative factors, that make it an interesting one to reccomend. On the one hand, it is unmatched in scale, allowing you to explore not only Europe, but the Middle East, India and the Americas as well. It also has unique units for each faction, which is an excellent feature. The downsides are moslty within the gameplay. It can get repetitive pretty fast, and the AI isn't exactly smart. Online play is still in beta, even at this date, so I can't exactly review it. Overall though, one of my favorite Total War titles. 7/10
3240	1	a	nice rts game :D
3661	1	a	The worse TW game ever. Broken beyond what any patch can repair. If you want something of this ERA, choose Napoleon TW instead, it is far far far better. CA made the decision not to port to Empire the improvements done in Napoleon in AI.
4029	1	a	Covering a vital part of European History, expanding into the American Revolution, Empire Total War provides an excellent mix of economic management and military strategy/tactics. The addition of the Warpath Campaign provides a much more indepth look at the progression of European invasion into the New World.
1520	1	a	Amazing strategy game. While a bit old, I still think it is one of the best in the franchise, and graphics and gameplay still feel up to date.
4858	1	a	I really like this game. Take 'astroids' and make it way cooler. Its one of those game i play until im sick of it and then put it away for awhile but always come back to and play. It can get a little repetative in that the map looks the same but i like the gameplay.
1533	1	a	Bought this game for 8 bucks with all Dlc... Used the money I saved to buy tea while I crushed the Spanish and French. I love this game, so buy it.
1307	1	a	Played as Britain and slaughtered every American Tribe  10/10 Would genocide again
4757	1	a	Decent little space RPG, shooter thing. Good for a few laughs and some action.  Just don't make your galaxy huge! Really, just don't! Everything in moderation, you know! Not enough varied content to fill such a big balloon.  8 / 12
3053	1	a	When the game came out it had huge ambitions, unfortunately it could not live up to them. The game is still ridden with bugs, although not game breaking. When you love the time period, when you love creating massive Colonial Empires spanning over the entire world, than this game is definitely for you!!! The sheer size of the campaign map, spanning 3 continets is something unseen even to this day. The land battles can somtimes be too easy for seasoned players but there are MODS that fix that. The naval battles are fenomenal, especially when you like the time period. From the Indian ocean up in to the Caribbean you gonna fight massive ship battles to establish control over the important trade routes that supply your empire with the with the most needed gold and wealth to crush your opponents.
2497	1	a	My first game I ever had with steam. I have over 750 hours on this game. Hours upon hours of fun. Some may say Napoleon Total War is better, but the shear size and flexibility of Empire Total War makes it stand out from the rest. A completely classic game.
2880	1	a	Confusing as hell but why the heck not?
3088	1	a	MERICA! â¥â¥â¥â¥ YEA! Coming to save the mother â¥â¥â¥â¥ing day YEA! England your plans are through, because now you have to answer too, AMERICA! !â¥â¥â¥â¥ YEAH! Killing Injins is the only way YEA!
4863	1	a	be pretty good if i new what i was doing :P
5306	1	a	Awesome game. I put a lot of hours in this game - probably the most out of any indie title.  If you ever like overhead space shooters, but always wished for a little more RPG elements in it, then this is the game for you. You can customize your ships, upgrade the ships that fly with you, and upgrade your main 'base'.   There's lots of missions to play so you never feel bored.   There's a lot of content in this game and I definitely recommend it!  Edit: The bounty hunters update added a lot to the game as well. Excited for SPAZ2!
12	1	a	I hate orcs and this is good for my soul
1983	1	a	Wish the game was more complete... overall....    8/10 Would Conquer Again....
563	1	a	A very fun and enjoyable game. Played at friends house and knew it was a must have.
4974	1	a	One of my favorite games of all time!
2481	1	a	The last hope of Westphalia were waiting inside their fortress - two regiments of line infantry and a mess of flintlock armed citizenry. I battered the face of the fortress with my cannon while 2 regiments of line infantry marched to the west and 2 regiments marched to the East of the fortress. I made two holes in their defenses (a regiment of citizens didn't get off the wall fast enough and they fell with the rubble and died). I waited two more minutes for my units to get in place, then sent my cavalry through the right breach. Though outnumbered, the cavalry were able to distract the defenders long enough that my Forces from the East and West were able to scale and take the walls without difficulty. The rest of my infantry rushed through the left breach and occupied the rest of the fort.  I had the option to end it there, but I declined. The Westphalians had taken one of my towns a few turns back, and I was still sore about it. My line infantry took care of the citizens, but the remains of one of the Westphalian infantry regiments was able to sneak out the left breach and was routing at a full run to the edge of the battlefield. I had a reserve cavalry division left outside the fortress who gave chase.   The neat thing about this game is that you can zoom in so close you can see the buttons on your soldiers' jackets. I zoomed in on the five retreating Westphalians as they descended a hill, almost certain they were going to cross the red line and clear the field before I could get to them, but seconds later I saw my cavalry, swords drawn, thunder over the bluff and fall onto the last hope of Westphalia. Not one of them crossed that line.  Then I checked my email, washed some dishes and went to bed.  9/10
153	1	a	This is one of very best tower defense game
4351	1	a	Best total war ever.
2947	1	a	While not as in depth as some games, grabbing the Darth Mod takes this game to a whole new level!
2120	1	a	Playes as the Dutch conqured india lost amsterdam became indian state with my new capital of ceylon. 10/10 would be Dutch Indian empire again
3191	1	a	This is One Man God and I recommend this game
1135	1	a	My pick for Orc murder simulator GotY. Smooth, polished, and tons of fun.
1573	1	a	I like this game ... 9/10   + artilery + strong cavalry  -sometimes stupid AI
1693	1	a	Best game of the total war series. It is more complex but it is more realistic in my opinion. Worth 20 dollars!
2655	1	a	empire total war is the best strategy game that ill ever play in my life :D
2787	1	a	It's a sad day for the Prussian artillery.
2902	1	a	Truly one of the best total war games I have ever played. When paired with Darthmod, that's a whole new level.
4890	1	a	Super fun and addictive, will hold your attention all the way though (provided you like playing upgrade style games). I definitely recommend.
3978	0	a	ON LINUX: Do not buy!  Used to play on Windows and really liked this game. Recommending for WS, even though not the best Total War I've played ;-).  But having Ubuntu 14.04 (mainstream distribution), having few nicely working games from Steam, this is huge disappointment. Optimalization obviously not right (if at all), lags everywhere (and I am sure not because of PC) even menu lags. During winter battles FPS droppes to 0.2 :D even with the lowest details (unplayable whole winter battles, da), but other battles 'work'. And mostly: sudden crashes, usually during naval battles (which I liked the most from Empire), but when spending 1,5 hours by shooting sails and capturing, last ship left to capture and game crashes, would you keep playing Campaign? Happened four times in different battles before moved me to write this review! I am sad I have to write this, but guess Linux fans of Total War series have to wait for another working TW Steam game.  Sum: Unplayable campaign because of winter battles (^unless wanna suffer through) and sudden crashes. :-(   P.S.: Would Love to read in comments about everything miraculously working in game on Linux.
5037	1	a	Nice concept and execution! I like it!
371	1	a	The nearly simultaneous release of this game and Dungeon Defenders has led to inevitable comparisons between the two games, and rightly so. Both games are Tower Defense games played on a personal level rather than a top down perspective. Both have the player control a character that can run the course of maps, place a number of defenses and traps, use different abilities and go toe to toe with the advancing mobs with melee and ranged weapons. The difference comes in the approach. Dungeon Defenders distributes the different abilities among different classes making the game virtually unplayable in single player especially if youâre playing a support class. Orcs Must Die has no multiplayer but gives all the abilities to one character with new abilities with each successful mission. Orcs Must Die also feels much more action oriented. If youâre looking for a good tower defense game that you can play by yourself, look no further than this game!
564	1	a	Simple and fun tower defence game. Solid and stylised graphics with a slick sense of humour. Difficulty curve is a bit all-over-the-place but the gameplay and enjoyment shine through
2084	1	a	I am a huge fan of the Strategy/Tycoon/Simulation genre in gaming. And, after three years of playing this game. I must say, this is certainly one of the better ones- if not, the BEST. On a multitude of accounts, I've played over 500+ hours on all of them. This game is addicting, and time consuming.  The game has a few modes. Campaign, where you take command of a nation, and have 99 years to build your empire globally. And then there is Multiplayer. The name says it all. It's where you attempt to out strategies the enemy. And lastly, it gives you the option to participate in a battle of your choice. This gives you the option to play land, sea, siege, or scenario battles. Each is unique, and synchronizes nicely.   PROS: *A Wide array of options, to rule your country. *Real-time experience. *Beautiful music *Jaw-droppingly addictive.  CONS:  *Horrendous face models. *Frequent online crashing *Half-brained AI. ( Both yours, and your opponents )
2509	1	a	Started playing Empire again and found it just as addicting as before. Forget Civ or any other war campaign game, this is the true game for warfare on a global scale.
5217	1	a	This is the best two dollars I've ever spent on a game. (I picked this up on a steam sale)
1018	1	a	its a medevil game and also a magical game Its preaty awsome and is a survival sort of game i recommend the game 10/9.6
2799	1	a	This game are for people who love war, friendship, trade and nations. become the ruler, diplomat or war lord. the things i didnt like was that there are few nations and a short period of time
4982	1	a	Hey so this game is pretty awesome. It has a real nice mix of top down arcade action with really simple controls and a deep RPGesque mechanic with tons of items that you can pick up and use (e.g. armor, weapons, drones, ship systems). This game is definitely worth the money.
3423	1	a	undoubtedly
936	1	a	Orcs Must Die! offers a unique perspective to the tower defense genere. Build your defenses and fight yoru way through swarms of orcs in this 3rd person behind the shoulder tower defense / beat 'em up hybrid game.
2373	1	a	Be prepared to lead armies amouting up to about 16,000 men across three different theatres. Also take to diplomacy and establish trade routes and alliances. All in all; a very fun game for any strategy fan.
1789	1	a	It is rather amusing to watch volley after volley of bullets mow down your enemies.  I LOVED Empire. But i see why critics called this a failure. I have recently brought Napoleon and even though it's not as fun and i don't play it as much. It has ALOT more content and worth than Empire.  6/10  Buy Napoleon instead or Get this if you are into the American Revolution instead.
505	1	a	love this game TD &amp; TPS Shooter= Exelent game Bravo
214	1	a	Orcs Must Die! is an orc racism simulation. You play as a white guy, the apprentice of another white guy, and spend literally the entire game killing orcs. That's super racist! I mean, it's not like it's sort of racist or anything like that. The name of the game is 'Orcs Must Die!' It's not 'Orcs Must Die if Convicted of a Capital Crime' or 'Orcs Must Die if it is Necessary to Employ Lethal Force in the Course of Self Defense' or 'Orcs Must Die if they are Soldiers in a Justly Fought War' or anything like that. Replace 'Orcs' with any other race in the title and you'd have a lawsuit on your hands! The only reason this game isn't banned in Germany is because nobody cares about orcs. I give this game 13 out of 16 race riots.
4148	1	a	This was the title that got me into Total War back in 2013. When everyone else was drooling over samurai in Shogun II, I was a few years too late playing Empire with this new invention I found called a reliable internet connection (not to be outdone by Steam a year later).  And I've devoated a few hundred hours to CA ever since.  There really is nothing quite like Empire. Maybe it's the lines of neatly-dressed men firing at each other, conquering the world at your beck and call. Maybe it's the history behind it, in a century that saw a resurgence in nationalism and the early quakes of ideology. Maybe it's the sheer romance of the time period. Redardless of my personal ramblings, millions of users and these thousands of reviews don't lie: Empire is a (relatively) modern classic that immerses gameplay and history in a thunderous ballroom dance that is typical of the time period and my dry wit.  Get this game or I'll give you a '10/10, would ____ again' gag.
4379	1	a	This is still one of my favorite total war games of all time. Total war with guns, what is not to like? 4 stars * It lost a star due to it being a bug ridden mess.
2420	1	a	Let me start off by saying that I am a huge total war fan, ever since medieval: total war I was hooked. At first, I was afraid if I would get the game back in 2009 because it was the first total war game to be put on steam. I had read all the reviews about the game(mostly bad) and steered away from it, I'm sorry I did. I finally picked up the game a year later and was blown away by it. First, the graphics were a huge step up from the previous total war(medieval 2), just see for yourself and judge. Second, the era of the game(ever watch the movie Patriot and wish you could do that kind of battle, well you can). And third, the actual combat that goes on in battle. If the campaign map is the bread, then the battles are the stuff in between that holds it together. You have to fight from a tactical perspective(like other total wars) worrying if your flanks are exposed to calvary, if your lines will hold against enemy fire, and hoping that your general doesn't get killed by a stray shot. These are just a few examples that help make my point. The amount of things that you can research is so helpful with making your troops better in battle such as fire by rank, quarter master, standard issue weapons, etc.... I could go on about it. Now for the bad stuff, luckily I am able to fit all of my issues onto one short piece of paper(unlike other reviewers, cough cough). First, the campaign map. I don't know what the developers were thinking when they were designing territories, but it just ended up falling short. Well how do I put it, you have alot of 'towns' to protect besides your own regional capital, forcing you the player to have to do more than bolster up defenses at your main city and watch the other resource producing towns around you. Now this would seem like a good idea on paper, but doesn't get executed very well. If your trying to stop an enemy army from constantly burning down every single factory or school in your territory, you have to split up your army into tiny little fragments in order to hunt down every last one of them. This may seem fine, but in reality this goes sideways when you do it in a recently taken over territory. I mean, whatever happened to just taking a city and razing it and making the people happy to just be alive, no instead there is a massive rebellion in the territory no matter how many troops your put in the garrrison, armed to the teeth with musketeers, cannons, cavalry, I mean were did the rebels get such stuff. I got off track, oh well, that's my only major complaint about the game, the difficulty of taking territories. Besides that, It's a pretty awesome game. It seems like I put more words in for negative than good, oh well I'm too lazy anyway and no one will probably read this review. If however you do find this review, congratulations you found a needle in a haystack of reviews=)
4844	1	a	Dont let the title of this game detour you, its a rather enjoyable mix of rts/rpg/shooter. Its also a bit openworld/sandboxish. You can appoarch the game in mulitple paths/play styles and what i enjoy most about it, is that it doesnt penalize players for making mistakes or trying sometihng new, in fact it encourages on the fly tatics and skill swaps. Download the demo and give it a shot. 3.5 out of 5 for a indie title.
4992	1	a	Surprisingly addictive and fun space action/rpg/ship game,
1192	0	a	Not a good game. Battle mechanic is clumsy and uncomfortable. Foes are EXTREMELY overpowerd.  Spend most of my time stuck in a small area surrounded by unbeatable foes. Same old hero's and units, very little has changed. Cannot sterss enough how stupid the battles are and it lost all it's fun. it's just isn't working!  Such a huge downgrade from Diciples 2 which I absolutely loved and played for many years! Didn't enjoy it even though I really tried (I spent 10$ on it, believe me I tried).  NOT RECOMMENDED!
1780	1	a	Great game!
982	1	a	A very amusing and well conceived strategy defense game. Definitely ranks highly on satisfaction. Nothing better than killing thousands and thousands of orcs in very non-repetitive scenarios.
954	1	a	Awesome defense plus action game, and amazing soundtrack.
1528	1	a	buggy... Like any other total war game, but when you can actually play it's great
4637	1	a	Best game ever! Couldn't stop playing... And the price is so low. Totally worth it!
3306	1	a	Empire: Total War  Pros: Turn based strategy game, great replay value. Price. Great campaigns. Cons: Errors, AI sucks, lack of uniqueness  Great replay value: The campaign is very fun, each country has their own unique set of challenges and issues you have to deal with throughout the game. A fun example, would be the French Grand Campaign, there is potential for fighting the French civil war or stopping the Americans from gaining their freedom while playing as the British Empire. Each and every empire has a set of exciting and challenging experiences that can change from game to game.   Lack of uniqueness: Empire Total War fails to permit individuality across most of the countries, almost all the major powers use the same units, leaving the ability to customize and makes use of variety of units non-existent. Unfortunately this applies to all the minor countries as well, such as, the native American tribes and the two Indian countries. One of the few saving graces, which all the countries share is the same selection of units. There is a large selection to choose from giving you a little customization in your armies.   Errors: To say there are errors in Empire Total War is an understatement, it truly is one of the most disappointing things about the game. Even with it being out for over five years, the errors are still very prevalent. Known campaign crashes, graphical errors and other game breaking bugs have yet to be fixed and probably won't be fixed.   AI is a disappointment: The combat strength in the AI is very poorly coded. You can use the same strategy in almost every battle and still come out on top. The battles start to feel very one sided. On top of that the AI never uses any kind of real strategy or war planning, they just send armies at fortified cities over and over again. Other things that would have been an easy fix would be for the AI to upgrade their units and not use the same units they start the game with, making late game not a game but a curbstomp.   Price: Even with all the errors throughout Empire Total War, it is well worth the non steam sale price of $15. The game provides several hundred hours of great in depth content, that is very enjoyable both in terms of tactical thinking in small battles, all the way up to planning your world domination.  
621	1	a	Honestly one of the best indie game i have had the chance to play, simple premices and tons of fun, the closest thing u'll find to a dungeon keeper, one of the rare games i just play after a bad day :) just makes me laugth and relaxes me, only thing i would say agaisnt it would be it's too bad they didn't addedd a coop mode, many dungeons you play woulda been perfect for a 2 man team, also it's too bad they didn't added a loot system, the game lends itself to collecting loot to upgrade ur war mage but unfortunatly they didn't go for that aspect, oh well can't have everything.
2312	1	a	YES YES YES.  This game is why Creative Assembly is going to be the father of my children. Such a peice of art work, with more positive sides then blind blonde twins. I used to have dreams about this game in my sleep, and I wont deny I woke up with my hands down my pants more than once. I love you SEGA for publishing it, and I will remember this game forever.  Yummmey
4389	1	a	Another great game. I play this through to the end, take a couple of months break and then start again. Different every time but challenging and enjoyable each time.
5174	1	a	it was pretty cool but they could have put a tiny bit bigger effort.................
2570	1	a	The feeling of cutting down a charge of hundreds of men while taking no losses yourself is indescribable to anyone who hasn't felt it. Buy this game.
748	1	a	Very addicting and fun.
1330	1	a	It's been a while since my first review of this game, so I felt it would be time to give out a more proper one. It's a good game, but not without several problems.  Empire: Total War, set in the 18th century, is a game I reccomend to the player who likes the idea of massive, 18th century-style land and naval battles. The game also has a very large campaign map, including India, Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, and the Americas. There's also a lot of colonialism involved as well, so if you like all of these things I mentioned, you'll probably like this game.   However, don't expect multiplayer to be a fun experience. It's still active, but there aren't many people playing. There's a good number of players here that will mistakenly or purposefully break the rules set by players hosting their games. Even hosts will break their own rules.   You also need to consider the fact that there are many players on here that have adopted the use of specific units that are simply OP, which therefore ruins the historical atmosphere of this game. Historically, most 18th century infantry were armed with highly innacurate guns, so they gathered in very large formations and fired at each other. They were called line infantry. This type of warfare was in no way meant to prolong the life of an individual soldier at all. The entire point of this type of fighting between infantry units was to use overwhelming force and numbers of troops and firepower to overcome the other side, which meant that line infantry would have to have some serious discipline and toughness. You'd rarely ever take cover, and if you were in the front lines, your slim chances of surviving the battle depended on how fast you could reload your gun and if you could make your shot count before the other side did the same thing you were meant to do.   Now, you'd think line infantry would be the staple unit on this game, and therefore they'd be pretty effective. However, their historical use as the essential staple unit for 18th century armies can easily be rendered useless on this game with just three types of units: Riflemen, skirmishers, and light dragoons.   The sad fact is that on multiplayer, the only three types of effective ground units that have any form of effectiveness on this game are the three units I stated above, aside from artillery. True, line infantry still have their uses, but not by much You see, the problem here is that skirmishers and riflemen have guns that can shoot farther than the muskets used by your line infantry, and they are unfairly accurate, meaning that your line infantry will be dropping like flies just trying to close the distance to take on the skirmishers and riflemen. They also reload their weapons incredibly fast. This is in no way historically accurate, because the guns used by lighter infantry forces at the time, no matter how far they shot, were still incredibly accurate and would have taken a long time to reload. Not only that, but we're talking about guns that weren't easy to aim with.   I could understand how lightly armed riflemen and skirmishers could give line infantry some serious trouble in, say, a bunch of forests, but they are so overpowered on this game that they can easily take out line infantry on an open battlefield.   Then there are light dragoons...  Light dragoons are soldiers riding on horseback, equipped with modified muskets that have shorter barrels. Therefore, they'd be less accurate, right? In real life, yes, but in this game? Wrong. Would it be easy reloading these guns on horseback? No, because muskets need to have the projectiles loaded with ram rods, primed, blah blah blah, shoot, repeat. It's difficult enough to do all of this while standing on your own two feet, but on horseback? That's bound to take longer.   Light dragoons can be incredibly dangerous to line infantry due to their superior speed, and because this game has overpowered them, every single soldier in a unit of light dragoons fires his gun, even the ones in the back. None of the troops in the front ranks of the dragoons die, and for some strange reason, a good number of the shots fired hit their mark. Sometimes, This means that you'll be having large numbers of line infantry dying all at once, which can cause a morale shock.   So unless you make rules against the use of light dragoons and skirmishers on the games you host in multiplayer, you'll be seeing these units being used on a constant basis, throwing all of the great historical accuracies of 18th century warfare out the window.  Now that's been explained, I should tell you about a few problems with other aspects of this game:  1) Despite the fact that Empire has a very large campaign map, you will be disappointed to find that almost every single battle map looks the same. Same texture, same everything. Yes, some buildings will look different depending on what part of the world you're in on the campaign, but you will quickly realise how bland the atmosphere of the maps are when you fight battles. Building detail in towns is also severly lacking.  2) The AI is incredibly dumb at times, so dumb that the developers decided to buff up the stats of the AI's units to compensate for their stupidity in the higher difficulty levels.   3) Individual troops in your army lack spatial awareness when they enter buildings or defend/attack fort walls in a siege battle. It's a horrid sight to see at times. Troops just move through each other in a frantic motion. Path finding on walls is also terrible.  4) Some sound effects for this game are awful, especially for muskets. For example, when a unit of line infantry fire a volley at the enemy, you only hear a 'poof' sound. These are primitive gunpowder weapons. They should be noisy and make a loud 'bang' when fired. Instead, the muskets used by your line infantry sound like fake guns used for movies in Hollywood.  5) You won't hear any general's speech before battle like you used to in Rome I and Medieval II.   6) There isn't much voice acting. You won't get to hear any voice acting at all when you initiate diplomacy, and the few bits of voice acting that you do here on this game tends to be subpar.  7) Melee combat between infantry units looks decent, but not amazing. The combat animations are too drawn out and look more rehearsed than realistic. Some of the combat animations are so terrible drawn out that everything looks unrealistic.  8) Because of the way the death animations work on this game, cavalry takes forever to take out a routing unit. Many times, an unnecessarily long combat animation has to be so terribly drawn out that it takes longer than needed for the cavalry to take out the routers. It'd be more convenient if the cavalry just swing their swords at boom, the routing units die faster.  9) Artillery units can be glitchy, even in multiplayer. Sometimes, they won't fire their guns no matter how many times you order them to.  10) On the campaign map, the AI controlling Britain, the United Provinces, and France tend to ignore India for some reason, so almost every single time you play this campaign, the Marathas end up becoming an OP faction.  11) There are no marching tunes with fifes and drums on the battlefield for any of the factions. This feature should have been implemented by the developers. I can understand that some players might find them distracting, but an option could be made to just turn off those marching tunes in the game.   12) Naval battles can sometimes be a little glitchy. Ships will sometimes move unnecessarily slow even when you order them to move faster.  This game can still be enjoyed despite all of these problems I mentioned. However, it will never be as great as it could have been. There are, however, a few mods for this game that you can use to make this game more enjoyable. Keep in mind that the mods are, unfortunately, not supported for Steam as there is no workshop.
2176	0	a	This is not a good TW game at all. It is buggy and straight up unfun.
3646	1	a	When you decide the fate of a nation. When you make the world yours. When the armies you command slaughter thousands upon thousands of barbaric hordes. When your howitzers fire corrosive lime shells on your enemies, eating away their skin. When you have rewritten history and experienced the rush of war and diplomacy,   then you have played Empire Total War.   P.S Download Darthmod, it makes a great game even better!
4731	1	a	Oh I love this game soooo much......  I give it two thumbs up......
3208	1	a	Great game
239	1	a	A superb 'Tower Defense' game that will have you coming back for more.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJRtNMrV-PY   Slice them, burn them, skewer them, and launch them - no matter how you get it done, orcs must die in this fantasy action-strategy game from Robot Entertainment.   As a powerful War Mage with dozens of deadly weapons, spells, and traps at your fingertips, defend twenty-four fortresses from a rampaging mob of beastly enemies, including ogres, hellbats, and of course, a whole bunch of ugly orcs. Battle your enemies through a story-based campaign across multiple difficulty levels, including brutal Nightmare mode!   Will you roast orcs in pits of lava, pound them flat with a ceiling trap, or freeze and shatter them with a slash? No matter the weapons and traps you choose, youâre sure to have an orc-killing blast! - Highly Recommended! 
1363	1	a	Awesome strategy game. I suggest purchasing the special units pack.
5050	1	a	The dialog is complete rubbish but eh game play is quite addictive.
1035	1	a	Murdering thousand of stupid orcs with gory traps? What's not to love?
2878	1	a	classic total war
4783	1	a	Seroiusly fun, endlessly addictive!
3505	1	a	Setting is great, scope is great (the entire â¥â¥â¥â¥ing world), battle AI leaves something to be desired. Can be sort of fixed with user mods.
4688	1	a	It's like a very simplistic Mount &amp; Blade game but with spaceships.
3457	1	a	This is an intense game revolving around who can mass-produce more formations of pointy stick guys until you can run over the people that ride elephants and camels and shoot guns
2259	0	a	Tally-ho and all that good stuff. Remarkable game 1/10
452	1	a	A great game if you have a cheap laptop, trying to perfect it is addicting.
3773	1	a	Very good, but the constant use of musketmen just gets boring, a battle just consists of watching one side shoot the other till they all die.... yea.... naval battles are cool but the ships are hard to control in large fleets.
162	1	a	I like this game! This is basically a tower defense + third person shooter, similar to Sanctum, but with a much better sense of humor and style, and doesn't give me motion sickness. Within the first five minutes of playing, I quickly felt inclined to play through the rest, which is a rare experience these days.   There's a good progression, as the game starts to get noticeably harder in the final levels. There is a nightmare difficulty once you beat the game on normal, for an even harder challenge. Every level you're presented with a new trap or item, but I found myself not using most of them, having tried them out and finding them less effective than existing gear. Since every level offers up to 5 stars, replay is fairly good for those striving for the most reward out of each level.  Well worth the asking price, especially on a sale. I hear the recently released sequel is even better, so I look forward to that.
1595	1	a	Fantastic infantry/cavalry/artillery/naval programming, I throughrougly enjoyed the grand campaign multiple times, and playing custom battles on both land and sea. Sadly the enemy AI appears quite basic, either you can run rings around them, or they relentlessly attack. The game is plagued by small bugs and glitches left in. It's heartbreaking because so many look fixable, as if SEGA just forced Creative Assembly to make 'Napoleon: Total War' rather than fix 'Empire: Total War'. This leaves Empire as a flawed experience. The worst issue seems to be a memory leak, reducing frame rates massively. This doesn't stop Empire from being a playable game massive in scope, and owning a big reputation.
4578	1	a	Overhead, 360 degree asteroids-type shooter with RPG mechanics and trade. Loved it for a while but the grind to improve my fleet became too slow to enjoy anymore, and I could no longer survive in any uncharted systems. It's worth $5 at least. I had a lot of hours of fun.
5289	1	a	The developers' pet project as the game they always wanted to play turns out to be one I've always wanted to play (and that you should too). SPAZ is one of the most brilliantly-executed 2D arcade space combat/trading games I've encountered. The depth is there, with research trees for technologies and blueprints for imaginative ship designs, with customizable weapon loadouts, and with over 200 star systems to explore per galaxy. There are hours upon hours of just plain fun gameplay to be had in this gem.
3747	1	a	Co-op campaign say goodbye to three months.
408	1	a	A Tower Defense pretty fun recommanded if you like that style of game !
2707	1	a	Highly detailed turn based strategy. Battles are fun but can become tedious. Thankfully there is a sim button. Can spend hours playing it! Real fun
1321	1	a	Darth-mod highly recommended, otherwise AI is outright terrible. Despite the AI flaws, it's a very good strategy game.
843	1	a	Starts out slow - boring, even. But the more new abilities, traps, enemies and levels you unlock, the more addictive it gets!
1546	1	a	638 hours playing this game, something must be good about it
4899	1	a	Before I knew it, I had played over 93 hours of this game. I'm almost afraid to try playing it again! So obviously I recommend it.
1283	1	a	I wouldn't call this game a hard tactical shmup as it's on the level of an easier Realm of a Mad God. Anything can become the stage as you can enter another level by hopping into the up arrow tile/manually enter a powerup on the ground/enter enemies or hell even your ownself. A good game to pass the time but I wouldn't call it a difficult shmup.
835	1	a	Tremendous fun and way way better than most of the offerings of the oversaturated hero/tower defense genre. Lovely physics gimmicks.
326	1	a	Fun game to play in between the deeper games. I would NOT pay $15 for it. Pick it up if it is on sale.
2342	1	a	great game but the graphics are crappy and the soldiers take forever to reload. but great game overall and has great siege battles 
4512	1	a	Very fun. You should play it.
964	1	a	Slaughter at it's best!
4317	1	a	A older game in the Total war series that focuses on and around the time of the American Revoulution.You can play all the MAJOR nations in Europe,India and Americas however you cant play as say Denmark.Each factions units have their own uniforms and Unique units.The Units themseleves are a little repetitive many have the same faces and after a while it gets boring to even look at the units.Cannons while deadly cant seem to hit the broad side of a barn with a big target on it.The campaign in this game is Average and dare i say Poor due to the fact its really just a Sandbox mode with Narratives and quests and did i mention theres only FOUR chapters?Five counting the US grand Campain(Us sandbox).Naval combat is decent and theres quite a few decent Mods out there if you want a good mod look up Darthmod.Overall its quite good for its age and i do recommend it.
70	1	a	It's the sorely needed missing link between Tecmo's Deception and mainstream appeal. No satan worshipping, though :/
92	1	a	Quality tower defense game (minus the towers). It's got traps, it's got shootan, it's got pretty funny jokes, and a buttload of content really.  Mindless fun.
4093	0	a	If you are a Rome Total War fan like me, then you will not like this game. The game play is ok until you have to battle which is alot. *sigh* That was my favorite part of RTW because you had an army at your fingertips fighting for you. Basically they did what you commanded them to do and it was awesome. The same can NOT be said for Empire Total War. Let me explain. More times then I would like to count, my troops... no sorry, what I mean to say is that a troop from a platoon or company of men I was commanding would get stuck and/or not move with the group he was with. This in turn would hold the platoon or company up from following my orders to attack or just defend themselves. They would always wait for one guy before following orders. Basically they would get slaughtered because this game was poorly programmed. Dont waste your time playing this game like I did. There are much better games out than this crap. 3/10  This guy knows what I'm talking about  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naQaRIaXyAU 
917	1	a	Solid twist on the Tower Defense Genre. Good introduction to the series if you get the whole franchise pack. Personally, I prefer the second game because there is significantly more flexibility in your game experience, more weapons, more traps, more levels, and more longevity, but the game is still money well spent. Like killing things with traps and weapons? Check. Like good solid humor? Check Interesting and motivating game soundtrack? Check Like a game that requires strategy and thinking? Check Like mass chaos that puts constant pressure on you? Check Like a overall solid game design concept? Double Check (You will get the partial joke here, if you have ever finished the sequel). Just get the game and play it, and you will understand in less than 5 minutes. Lightning in a bottle.
3737	1	a	Loved the game. Best being the British and crushing the enemy with the redcoats.
47	1	a	Orcs Must Die is a third person, action, tower defense game. You play as the War Mage, who's job is to kill Orcs, often in rather comical ways. In each level, the Orcs will spawn in waves and try to enter the rift and it's your job to kill them. This done via laying traps, using weapons, or placing guardians to fight by your side. After each level, you will be given a new power to use and skulls based on how well you did; the less Orcs that make it through the rift and the faster you do it, the more skulls you earn. These skulls can then be spent on upgrades for your traps and guardians.   After many hours of gameplay and tens of thousands of Orcs slain, I can safety say that this game IS FREAKING AWESOME. I've sunk about 45 hours into this game (counting the dlc missions). Let that sink in: 45 hours of gameplay! There are triple A games out there that give a fraction of gametime with several times the cost. It's a steal, esspecially if you can get on sale.   However, this game is about exactly one thing: killing Orcs. Beyond that, there's really nothing else to do, but for its price, its a hard deal to beat. If your own the fence, try the demo or watch some clips on youtube. And if you like what you see, buy it. Especially if you can get the entire series bundled and discounted.   TLDR: 10/10   Disclaimer: No Orcs were harmed in the writing of this review. Harmed before, oh hell yes!
4082	1	a	Love the game
3681	1	a	Positives: Huge map, exciting era of human history, and lots of factions to battle and choose from (especially with mods). For a fun campaign, I highly recommend America with the Elite Units packs. Great Britain is also very fun in the Grand Campaign. For the most challenging campaign, I recommend the Ottoman Empire (since there are multiple factors working against you).  Improves: ETW had a coop multiplayer in beta mode, but it fell short when they did not stick with allowing players to battle against the computer (every battle was pvp); this was the biggest downside overall. Also, sometimes the CPU will make extremely stupid tactical and strategic decisions during the game (i.e. a very weak country will declare war on your powerful one, or have their general literally walk up to your front line during a battle to get shot to pieces).  Beyond the small improves, if you're into the colonial era, I highly recommend this game.
816	1	a	Tower defense is really growing on me lately and this is essential massacre fun. The traps require lots of strategy and many games will leave you on edge taking out the few who make it through everything. Later on you focus on traps on increasing your own power to deal with the invasions yourself! Nice variety of orcs too.

3116	1	a	the game is fun I recommend you to buy it. I give it a 9/10
1485	1	a	This product has been certified anime-free.  9 of 10.  The first TW game not to 'feature' huge slabs of cardboard UI that fills up the screen. Lovely!
4549	1	a	Really really really cool and entertaining game!!!! Basically kind of a big deal.
3377	1	a	Still not perfectly stable, but this map blows Napoleon away.
2797	0	a	Now, while it is true I barely scratched the surface of this game (though I did play offline for around 3-4 hours) I have to say that I was expecting more. As a Welsh man, I was at the least expecting some mods or DLC to allow me to not be called England or to have more say in what gets built here - yes I know that is a little petty, but heck it'd be nice to have more options available on the 'Empire', why didn't they include every region in a massive mode that could be played in multiplayer, for example? It would have made things feel a lot grander in my opinion. That being said, the overall feel of the game was vastly different from what i'm used to in a Total War game, also. I quite enjoy M:TW and its sequel, and I enjoyed Rome Total War also. The change to cities, assassins, diplomacy, retraining troops... even the whole segmented continent maps... It all seemed a little too much like watching ants with a magnifying glass rather than being in charge.  I mean yeah, I openly admit it - i'm not that fond of the battles in these games, I would much rather auto-resolve battles after spending hours building my empire, so maybe my opinion is pointless. But hey, as an individual who likes a wide range of army strategy from Age of Empires to Lord of the Realms, Civilization to Total Annihilation, this one just wasn't as good as others in the series in my eyes. Call me dumb, i'm just being honest. I would give it a 6/10 - and for a series as big as Total War, that simply isn't good enough for me. I'm just glad I tested it during the free weekend.
3575	1	a	decent game although, it was precursor, to far more better complete TW game NTW.
3065	1	a	This game is fantastic and this is my very first time playing a grand stategy game! I love the campaigns. You actually get involved in the characters lives and you feel like a wonderful leader of an even more powerful army. This game has truly surprised me.
3770	1	a	at first i was kind of stuck, i didnt know what to do even tho i did the tutoriul. i had ione of my freinds help me out and i began to play alot more, i love the game now and i am a master. although i do play on darthmod for campains (because its stupid with out it) if you liked napoleon, shogun 2 fots you would love this one amazing game! :)
3078	1	a	Easily one of the best Total War games to date. It has replayablility, in depth turn-based grand strategy, and tactical real time battles that have the sight, feel, and sound of the Age of Colonialism.  Although it came out awhile ago, its graphics are not terrible by any means, and as you can see from my own play time: It's a favorite.  I also nominated this game for the 'Game within aa Game' award, because it really does feel like two different games. One momment your in the cannon smoke filled fields being a Genearl and master tactician of troops, and in another you are a King: Whose will is absolute and you have a wide range of abilities that factor your economy, your peoples opinion of you, espionage, research, infastructure, and of course building and maintaining an army (Their expensive by the way)  Only downside is that Sea warfare is kinda tricky, but the graphics and simiulations of boarding another's ship and claiming her for your own is very satisfying. ;)   Defs buy this game if on sale and if its not buy it anyways, especially if you appreciate the Total War franchise.
303	1	a	Awesome tower defense style game - blast to play on the ground
3583	1	a	Amazing game cannot find anything wrong with this game except that I would like to see a better controll screen like Napoleon has
3043	1	a	Cool
5247	1	a	One of my favorites. This game took the basic 2D motion of Asteroids and turned it into a very entertaining space saga. The graphics are fun, the story is wild and the basic gameplay is a blast. The only stumbling block is that some of the potential builds are really terrible such as a stealth, missile or mine setup. The game forces you into beams or particle weapons if you want to kill anything in a reasonable amount of time. I look forward to the next effort by this developer.
2330	1	a	I got my full monies worth out of this game. For an old game at this time, it has aged well. Look for it on sale if your new to the Total War series and pick it up. The naval combat was satisfying, and the improved trading system just made more sense in this game.  Final result: Buy it
2332	1	a	these game is alsome the guns and the thinking but i finded nepolen eleter better and i dont like the grafix that much there faces scarses me but I LOVE TOTAL WAR!!!!!!
3225	1	a	From all the Total war series, I believe that this is far the best, ease of use, managability, no doubt that this should be the basis for future Total war games
1477	1	a	I love this game, I'm not the best at it, mostly because I'm used to Rome: Total War, but it's great. This game stays true to the Total War series while still adding more to it.
3106	1	a	A great game, I really enjoy playing it!
4800	1	a	Spaceships, lasers, missiles, explosions and crewmen fighting off zombie boarding parties. Difficulty varies quite wildly depending on what gear you focus on, so there's plenty of scope for making the game a challenge. Customize your ships, build a little fleet and go pirating across the galaxy!
3692	1	a	Even though it's buggy and unoptimized it's still pretty fun. Thanks to Creative Assembly's awesome QA process the game was basically unplayable for the first 6 months of it's release but it's now...playable at least.
3789	1	a	Has more countries and units as napoleon total war, but napoleon total war has way better combat. DONT BUY NAPOLEON THOUGH because empire has a mod called darth mod witch adds a ton more units, enhances the graphics, more playable countries, and fixed almost all of the bugs i saw. just added a bit more lag.
947	1	a	Great game. Must-have tower defense game that incorporates third-person shooter very well. Strategy is very necessary then again so is character control. Sweeet!
3554	1	a	you all need this game
2267	0	a	The game is full off bugs....dont buy
2165	1	a	Took over the whole world playing as the Russians. 10/10 Would make my own Soviet Union again Stalin would be proud.
1798	1	a	This game is an awesome strategy game that allows the player to control his/her own army. It requires deep thinking an strategic moving or just rushing the enemy, the choice is yours. However the fact that this games multiplayer is not suited towards Mac users greatly angers me and I think that the developers should introduce a cross over for multiplayer for both Macs and PC's.
653	1	a	It's a good game, but it gets pretty hard towards the end. The sequel is better.
273	0	a	Poor controller support and lack of autofire made playing this game physically impossible for me.
2123	1	a	This game hard. It takes alot of time to get to know everything about it. But after you put the hours in... You'll enjoy it.
3063	1	a	I've spent countless hours conquering the world with this game, I recommend it to anybody who loves strategy games or the time period it is set in (18th Century) I also recommend using the mod DarthMod Ultimate Commander, which improves many aspects of the game.  Updating for the steam awards. Still enjoying the game!
4199	1	a	With Darthmod, this game is a gem that will keep you busy for many hours to come. It's one of them that's still being played to this day, if you dont own this buy it.
243	1	a	I Love the game
4629	1	a	Excellent game, top down space warfare reminiscent of Star Control. Highly recommend the game. Has an entertaining storyline also.
4272	1	a	I have recently completed the long campaign on the difficult setting as Britain. I have also completed the independence campaign. Although the game has been around for a long time I found it an asborbing experience to play and worth the large amount of time required to successfully complete the long campaign. Having said that there are issues that detract from the game and these probably apply to the total war series in general. Issues that have been mentioned in other reviews include the inappropriate use of bomb ketches and rocket ships in naval battles. Either they should not have been included in the game or the ability to have coastal battles and sieges in which these ships could have been used should have been developed. Puckle guns are another unit mentioned before that were not actually used in the era and therefore should probably not have been included. Going back to the idea of coastal sieges Marine units might have been an interesting addition to the game and created a bit more diversity in the battle environments.  The battle experience could have been improved by having some sort of smart setup option. I often found I laid out my armies and fleets in the same way, dependent upon the landscape. The ability of the game to remember a preferred setup style and to vary it depending on the terriain could help save a lot of repetitive setup issues. When it came to deciding battles against missmatched armies and fleets using the auto resolve often your troops ended up taking relatively heavy losses. When your fleet came up a mismatched fleet often weaker fleet would be entirely destroyed when it should probably have just been captured. It might have been good to have options on the auto-resolve to indicate tactics that your fleet or army could utilise that would lead to a lower loss of life or the capture of enemy vessels. This would cut down on the 'grind' of some of the battles.  The final issue that I felt could have been better was the 'end'. Just a fairly lame animation and that's that. What I think alot of players of the Total War series would find really interesting would be a 'history' of their campaign sort of like at the end of a Civilisation game. There could be a quick history that showed general information about your game play and other nations and a really detailed turn by turn game history that showed everything from the movement of individual units to general economic and social issues of each faction. Notable battles could highlighted and replayed and pivotal movements could be highlighted. This would be a rewarding experience for a player who has devoted a considerable length of time to playing. It could also be used as feedback for the game developers to find out how the game is played and how it could be improved. These 'histories' could even be shared and 'ranked' between players to create interest for different players to develop their tactics and strategies. Perhaps, there could also be a comparison with the actual events of the era.
2506	1	a	empire total war is set in the 18th centery and is also the first total war to have navel battles so for those who want to ern there sea legs this is your chanse i personally am not a skilled admeral but i play navel once in a while the land battles are differnt from previose total wars gun powder is widly used so if you have played othier total war games you may have to adapt your tactics the campagin is huge spanding the Americas, Europe, and India this gives you a lot more factions to interact with and more teritory to conquor this is in my opion a fine adition to the total war family
750	1	a	funny story lines and hillraious character.
540	1	a	very fun its a must buy
5332	1	a	Just look at home many hours I have spent in this game... NUFF SAID!
2893	1	a	Best game ever. Still my favorite of all. I wish the Total War franchise would revisit this game and add more DLC's, maps for other continents, or better yet, a new version with the same core concept.
999	1	a	Better as OMD 2. worth a price.
1850	1	a	I spent a long time looking at this ame and not playing it. I actually owned it, I just didn't expect much of it. They I went back and read my Sharpe collection, the books. Thought to myself, I need a game with muskets. 'Oh, what about that game?'.  Playe it for like ten straight hours. Thisgame handles OVERALL difficulty well. Each nation you can choose poses different threats and challenges. This is very important in a campaign central RTS. The diplomacy is stupid. The battlefield Ai, pretty stupid. But when it works, the game is fantastic. For each flaw there are ten qualities.  And some of the best naval battle simulation I've ever seen.  Oh, and its that brutally honest kind of game where sometimes, at the very start of the battle, a cannonball bounce high up in the air, comes right down on your general and kills him. And then your mighty army slowly backs away.
3735	1	a	I restored Sweden's Empire and beat the hell out of Russia. Carolus Rex would be proud :D
2876	0	a	Love the game, just so sick and tired of it crashing constantly! Locks up to the point you can't even close it with task manager! Save every turn, and then if it locks up, go back one or 2 saves, and change the way you did things, and hope it doesn't lock up again!
3315	1	a	best game ever......i cant wait for the next release(like 1st,2nd world war)
2801	1	a	Why ottoman empire so weak? every autoresult battle always lose?. but its ok, its recommend
2503	1	a	I love this game its realy addictive and i cant turn off my computer i am like 1 more turn and then i get atacked ok 1 more turn i get atacked ok 1 more turn and i am done then i realise that its night ok 1 more turn and i go to sleep after 120 turns i realyse thats its arleady morning most addictive game ever 10/10
4452	1	a	I've played the AOE series since they first came out of hiding, AOE 3 is not the best in the series (2nd is without doubt) but it is still a great buy and offers good fun for you money.
4672	1	a	ITS JUST GOOD  
4027	1	a	the world is not what you think in this game make war on anyone you can and you'll be fine
4568	1	a	Great game!. And It's an Indie title so you know the two (yes two) people who worked on it really gave a full effort. And it shows. I totally reccamend purchasing this game.
2231	1	a	One of the best Total War games. Had the game way before buying on steam. If you like Total War games, forget Rome, Shogun, Rome 2 and other new ones. Get this one and have endless hours of fun.
2268	0	a	I cant even play it on my computer
2911	1	a	Traditional Total War game, I found having a navy outside of tradeships to be uneconomical.
3198	1	a	I recommend this game if you love freedom of choice, 1700s, ruling governments, and classical European warfare.
3520	1	a	Not to into RTS's but this game is O.K.
1207	0	a	Sarge, take me back to disciples II im tired of this ****
3340	1	a	great strategy game love fighting on the sea
1473	1	a	I completely recommend this game. It's already a few years old, so I would advise to wait for a sale perhaps... but considering that I have spent that many hours on Steam playing this game (and many hours off-Steam as well), even paying the full price does not mean you'll feel ripped off. You're not only buying quite a lot of game with your purchase, you're also buying the best single-player experience any Total War can bring you.  Total War is a series that combines the most massive and spectacular battles you will find in any game with the building and managing of an empire in single player. In multiplayer it's the best game of chess you can have. This particular Total War is set in the early Modern Age (1700-1800), and for the first time includes line-infantry with muskets as the backbone of an army and not a melee unit, which makes for a unique Total War. In this era, the European countries were involved in a lot of wars with eachother while they conquered several continents and established trade routs with most of the rest of the world, and I do not know of any other media that encompasses that much of this era like in Empire: Total War.  From my point of view, this is the last of the true and classic Total War games. I have played every Total War (including Shogun) and my favorites are Rome 1 (not rome 2, absolutely not rome 2) because of the way it represents the classical era, Empire because I am personally very interested in this era as well and it is unique in the ranged combat with muskets and I love Shogun 2, because it simply has the best multiplayer. There is also a stand-alone expansion of Empire about the conquests of Napoleon, something I had been anticipating for many years, but I didn't like it enough. It's too limited. I also don't appreciate a lot from the medieval era in general. It's chaotic, it's too religious/christian, there is no progress, there is death, decay, famine and the plague and Medieval Total War games represent this fine, I don't like it.  Why do I consider this the last Classic Total War? Well, Total War is a game that, as you play, can teach you stuff. Like in Rome1 you learn that clear glass was invented, in Empire you get info along the way about what happened in the 18th century and it was a lot. In fact, the only good description I can find about my 'religion', Secular Humanism, I found in Empire Total War. This is also the last Total War in which the campaign map is open, you can send your armies where you want and you're not stuck in corridors like in the latest installments. However, it is the first Total War to include a tech-tree and naval battles (and naval battles were very spectacular in this era!).  The 3 continents you can explore with armies and conquer are Europe, North and Middle America and the Indian sub-continent (you can walk from Western-Europe to India if you please, or sail around Africa). There are also a few trade regions to conquer using just the navy: the east coast of South-America, the west coast of Africa, the strait of Madagaskar and the East-Indies. Every region has it's own feel and it's own enviroments, cultures, empires and people.  The units you command are also unique for each culture. Yes, warfare was a lot about standing in lines facing eachother firing lead balls back and forth and then reloading for quite some time, the native americans for instance are better equiped for guerilla style battles combining melee with light infantry equipes with muskets or bow and arrow. Along the tech-tree you unlock new units to build and command, artillery changes from simple big cannons to a whole specrum of weaponry. Ranging from mortars to puckle-guns (rapid fire musket, very early machinegun) and stuff in between. Cavalry also comes in many flavors, dragoons that melee on horseback but function as line infantry dismounted, full melee cavalry and the cavalry even gains horsedrawn cannons as technology is invented. And the ships! Oh man, imagine the big ships of the line with over 40 cannons on each broadside, 2 lines come within eachothers range... just crank up the sound to really loud!  Like most Total War games, the game has improved a lot because of mods, Empire is no exception. Even for new players I would recommend to install and use at least Darth Mod, which can be found in the Steam Workshop. More units are also available with mods, but I'm not sure which one to recommend. But the Darth Mod really improves the ai and the feel of the game.  Every Total War has it's own features and it's own feel to it. Personally I find this installment the best in single-player of the entire series. I have had some really tight battles in the campaign. In Empire it is possible to position your men in some buildings, so making a last stand gets it's own feeling to it. Your men firing from the windows at incoming soldiers while your lines of infantry try to hold the lines in front of that building, untill the fight turns melee when the bayonets are pointed at eachother.  And I haven't even mentioned the historical battles that come with each Total War, you can reenact battles that actually took place and with a historically similar setting and armies to command. Pitching you as Washington vs the Brittish and many others. There is a demo available here on Steam, in it you can play at least one of these historical battles and get a glimpse of what is in store for you when it comes to battles, but if you like games like Civilization or RTS games like Age of Empires and you haven't tried Total War at all, you will love it!
1507	1	a	at the beginning it can be a little bit frutrated cause is more complex tha MTW2, but u will love it. If u love startegy this is ur game.
4819	1	a	Surprising depth to the combat system, combined wih a bucket load of different hulls and components, and a thoughtful tech tree, and a variety of other well executed game mechanics, keep this game from getting old.
2908	1	a	I cant play with my friends i got the game 2 days ago but im on version 1.2 and they have had he game longer and are on version 1.5 so i cant play with them and i cant find out how to update it. Help please im playing on a macbook air
3349	0	a	i imagine if you can deal with the awful control of your units on the battlefield, you can really really get into this game. however, i had no fun in the naval battles or land battles. love the campaign though.
2062	1	a	What an amazing game. Even after all these years it still holds up as an excellent rpg. Still playing after 200+ hours on different consoles. Worth a buy!
2701	1	a	Very good game for those who like grand, turn based strategy. In my opinion, the best game in the Total War series.
5073	1	a	more fun than it is supposed to be. addictive like hell !
1959	1	a	A massive game has continued to get better with Darth Mod's patches etc it's now far better than it was on releaseand it is great fun fighting the American War of Independance as well as lot of other wars around the same period. Probably the best TW game ever made and the onyl one that has remained on my computer, even if its just because I love fighting armoured elephants!
1544	1	a	It is the ultimate game for the strategist at heart!
4585	1	a	SPAZ is a great game were you can destroy spaceships and stations of mass destruction and build a fleet and you can add mods which is a cool feature but i wish it had multiplayer
18	1	a	Orcs Must Die! Is a first-person tower defence game developed and published by Robot Entertainment. It was released in October 2011. You play as a War Mage that defends his rift, or base, against the enemy orcs and fellow allies. In the first-person aspect, your War Mage has weapons that you use against the enemy and you construct defences to defend your Rift. This game is purely single-player. This review will cover the overall concept in regards to story and downloadable content, gameplay, and to a smaller extent, performance.  Orcs Must Die features a simple concept with an easy learning curve. The simple concept is tower defence and there is no tutorial because you place units to defend and should not require assistance. This game features 25 base game missions with 5 separate missions through the Lost Adventures DLC and there is a small story attached to the base game missions. The DLC contained new units and new levels, so while there is a passable amount of content, for $2.99 it does no harm. There is three difficulties so this game has enough replayability for 25 hours. Regarding the story, I did not overly understand the actual story at hand because it was not emphasised. The start of each level had the War Mage advancing the unclear story such as him being alone in the mages and having to defend against the enemy. There were around three cut scenes in the entire base game missions that succulently revealed the story but without those, the attached story was unclear and an afterthought. If the story was emphasised more through cut scenes this game would have been better. Moving on, each level is different and vary in difficulty, providing a new experience with most of the levels. For instance, as one level progressed it increased in difficulty. As the missions progressed, it became harder in difficulty. Therefore, I praise the level designs that are neat and add diversity and fun towards the game. As for enjoyment, I enjoyed the missions and the overall concept and style for the most part, but levels started to become stale and therefore, were becoming boring but luckily I finished all missions on easy difficulty without being burnt out.  The gameplay is basic and has a large amount of variety. The gameplay aspect is a wave begins and your units and your player beat the enemy, gaining income to spend on other units or upgrades. There is a very nice variety of units because there is a total of 30 units and weapons, and while I used the same eight for each mission there were other options at least. One feature is the upgrade tree, which is three different trees with different abilities and the player chooses one per level. You spend your currency you gain from killing enemies on unlocking abilities in the tree through a vertical skillset approach, which is you unlock skill one, then you can unlock skill 2 and so forth. For instance, one skill may be reducing the reload times for timed units. I like this but I believe its unbalanced because for 29 missions I used only one tree and the other mission I used another one, as that particular tree I mainly used drastically improved the powers of my units. Another system is the upgrading of abilities and/or reducing the cost of your units after the levels by using skulls. For instance, upgrading archer guardians would reduce the price from 600 coins to 500 coins. This proves incredibly useful because of the course of the level, as things get harder, you need stronger units. The game makes the little things count, such as witty comments from your War Mage to the sweet killing animations, providing a light-hearted atmosphere. Furthermore, the artwork is very nice with its cartoon approach that freshens the games apperance. The one main issue I had with the gameplay was the generic movements by the AI and their lack of animation in attacking and rushing. For instance, I felt that each unit lacked diversity in movement and animation because the ogres have different clothing and names but all have the same animations and movements. This is the same with the orcs and the flying units. It gets repetitive as well because you get the feeling its like 'oh, the ogre is charging at me again'. The other small issue was the pathfinding bugs with enemies, but not a major issue.  The performance was consistent and is optimised. I could play on max settings at 60+ FPS. This is not a big deal but just thought I would mention it.  Orcs Must Die is a solid game. It benefits from the simplicity and diversity of the game in enemy characters, units and the basic nature of defending against multiple waves of enemies. It suffers from the lack of animation and movement in enemy, that makes the game repetitive and towards staleness. The story is very disappointing as it is an afterthought, though it has its small moments. The artwork and gameplay is neat and light-hearted and the overall atmosphere of the game matches this description. I completed the game in eight hours and this was an appropriate length because I was close to being bored. But, I enjoyed it for the most part because of the simplicity. Furthermore, has its pros and cons and is a solid game, however, it does not stretch into being a good game. At $12.99 for the game of the year edition, I recommend it on sale. Itâs a fun game that is casual and easy to play but there is not enough fresh content to play this for twenty hours.  Ratings system: For this particular game, I will rate the concept and gameplay judging from what I wrote and average those scores. I will then range the score to what I felt it should be given.  Concept: 6.5/10 Gameplay: 5.5/10 Overall: 5.5/10  Thanks for reading my review!

435	1	a	Really love the mix of tower defense and action :) And the humor makes it pretty funny. If you have seen the trailer of the game and you are hyped, then i most definatly recommend this game :D
1318	1	a	Total War Empire  This is a really good Total War game. It is more up to date than Medieval II (good game) and playes much better than Napoleon or Shogun II. Shogun II runs badly and has balance issues, whereas Napoleon has few enemies (although those few enemies have large territories.)  You get to perform research in Empire. I do wish the research tree was larger for Battle and Economic areas. It is very large on Philosophy.   The units are nice. All three arms of the military, infantry, cavalry and artillery, are equal in this time period and thus all three types of units have a role on the battlefield. Having a good mix of these works really well.  Generals can be appointed easily and troops can move and attack without generals.  Trading is neat. Diplomacy works well too.  Ship battles are cool.  Anyway, this is a good Total War title. I had no problems getting the game to run in Win 7 64-bit. Good game.
4482	1	a	SPAZ is an awesome game, you gather resources and manage your own fleet of starships, everything can be customized, from engines to missiles. Took me about 22 hours to finish the campaign, the map is huge, the more you explore the more ships and technologies you unlock, and to complete the package the game support mods, you can simply download a Star Trek or Battlestar Galactica mod that will customize all your ships!
2505	1	a	For a true connoisseur of strategy games and military history, definitely a game worth playing. Between the Road to Independence story, various Grand Campaigns to be done through Europe, India and the Americas with varying modes/difficulty, and the multiplayer experience, you easily have 700+ hours of gameplay.
4991	1	a	The other day I scavenging a ship out in the old mine field, when I noticed that there was â¥â¥â¥â¥ growin' all over the walls. Needless to say I got in my ship, and got the hell outta there.  12/10 - Best game in a few years imho
1350	1	a	I Personally love this game so much. It maybe old but its just so fun and amazing. They need to make another one that adds the bullet and cannon camera like in Napoleon Total War and mix in some Sniper Elite X Ray Cams. They have to go all out if they make another one where its like the game already has all the mods so large massive numbers. Blood effects and so much more you can possibly add I love this game so much
2054	0	a	Just buy Shogun 2 Fall of The Samurai. So much better executed as a game and is quite similar to Empire.
2637	1	a	This game is a very good game historicaly and gameplay, ive had many hours of enjoyment and certainly encourage you buying the small expansion packs. also i like it how there are still multiplayer servers since its an old-ish game
3547	1	a	If your calvalry gets attacked from behind, they won't try to defend themselves, they'll just patiently wait for death to consume them. Your canons will also send grapeshot through your ranks if they're in the way.
4422	1	a	Started a game as the Marathas ---&gt; removed Mughals and Europeans from Glorious India. Invaded the Middle-East, took out the Ottomans with Russian help.  D-day into Iberia just for the giggles. My general: 'Our artillery shall blot out the sun' Spanish guy: 'Then we shall fight in the shade' My General: 'Our artillery shall blot out the shade' Spanish guy: 'F**k'  7,34/10 Would conquer America as the true Indians again.
3657	1	a	great game i would say better than napoleon tw because of its whole world aspect and gives you the chance to conquer one theatre or conquer the whole known world from north and parts of south america to the mystical wonders of the east or the noble europe? What will you do with your power?
2684	1	a	You like Empires? You like Empires at war? 10/10 would kill pingrims again.
4733	1	a	shoot many things so good
840	1	a	This game can puzzle you since there are so many ways you can finish each level, but a good game nonetheless, I guess you can really test your creativity here. You better have a fast clicking ffinger because you're going to left click a lot lol.
1836	1	a	I haven't played a RTS styled game since Red Alert on PlayStation, for some reason they don't draw me in as much as FPS or RPG's do. But I thought I'd give it a go. This game is one of the most addictive games I probably have ever played. At first the amount of depth that's in the game seems overwheling but before you know it you are worrying about the econmy and politics. This game just blows my mind. I reckond that everyone gives it a go.
4779	1	a	can someone help me mod this
585	1	a	Tower defense game for people who hate tower defense games.   I hate tower defense games.
1900	1	a	Empire Total War is the game in the Total War series which appears to receive the most hate. Having played the game itself, I can safely say that it is decent. As a game it does what it does but no more no less. There are a limited number of units which are available to all sides save for the Indian, Ottoman, and Maratha factions. The gameplay itself can get repetitive overtime but still follows the format seen in all Total War games. Creative Assembly had done a good job in terms of historical accuracy and introduced me to different variations of troops seen during the 1700s. Compared to the other games, I can see where the hatred is coming from and I can see it for it's flaws but it does do what it is meant to do correctly. There are also minor inconveniencies such as the tax system of having to travel from region to region just to access it's stats which gets tricky once you have occupied lot of them and that unrest is hard to quell. I will give this game a 7/10.
4184	1	a	This is a no brainer for me, as I already own Rome, Medieval, and Napoleon titles in the Total War series. This game has the largest amount of DLC available besides Shogun 2 thus far, and includes a nation that none of the other games offer, the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA!!!! So, if you have ever wanted to send the red coats running at historic battles like Bunker Hill, or be the red coats at Yorktown (LOL) then this is the game for you!
4402	1	a	In this game i can occupied, contorl every region and change history of wold in 18th century
1042	1	a	love the game
2507	1	a	Huge upgrade from the earlier titles. After playing through the previous Total War titles, this has to be my favourite among them.
3840	1	a	aRE U NOT ENTERTAINED
2070	1	a	Do you like some large waves of troops clashing in some servere 18th century combat? This is the one to get. Nice ancient pirate style ship combat. You can use artillery to soften up the enemy lines. Then move in with muskets and swords to kill your enemy. With or without the support of large groups of horse cavellery.   The graphics look good. The units are detailed for a large scale combat. The sounds and music match the game. Nice indeed a definitve must have I must say.
5319	1	a	Being an avid ArmA 2 Wasteland/DayZ player back in the day (about 1.5 years ago), I relished the thought of a new ArmA coming out. ArmA 2 was practically uknown until it's popularity was increased by DayZ. I found it interesting to jump into a BI (Bohemia Interactive) title that already had a steady fan-base behind it. Having been about a year since I purchased this game (launch) and over 100 hours of solid gameplay I feel that I can finally write a review that encompasses many of the aspects I have experienced within this game. Now I know what you're thinking: '$59.99?! This isn't even considered a triple A title! That's like... that's like the price of CoD: Ghosts!' Now, don't be intimidated by this price, for I can say that off the bat this game is worth a lot more than $59.99. From a value perspective, I found the price to be very reasonable based on the game's content nowadays.  Basically, ArmA is a series of hardcore military simulation; constantly reflecting real-world conditions into a video game. In ArmA 2, I feel that this was it's drawback, for there were certain scenarios where it was realistic to a point of frustration (breaking your leg on a 2 foot fall. It's a game guys, relax). ArmA 3 has found a good balance between an FPS/3rd Person shooter game and realism, making it extremely enjoyable as both a simulator   and   a game. I also found that ArmA 3 has very good support for newbies to the series and is able to really engage players into the fun. I imagine it is much easier to get into ArmA 3 than I did ArmA 2 (I can't judge, I'm not new to it).   The engine is decently optimized and is far less clunkier than the ArmA 2 engine, however rocks are still (and I guess forever will be) broken. Perhaps the game is having difficulty conforming such free player movement with an un-even surface.   Pro tip: NEVER WALK ON ROCKS UNLESS YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO.  The game also has a variety of content; although players coming over from 2 will notice that there are A LOT less guns. This is partly due to the customization of guns. Instead of having a separate gun for each gun variation (M4A1 HOLO, M4A1 CCO, M4A1) you have a base gun and you are able to add sights, lasers, silencers, flashlights, what have you. However, this is not a full excuse- I feel that there are still a lesser amount of overall GUNS to shoot. Perhaps Bohemia Interactive is trying to fine-tune each gun into the patches as opposed to adding a ton of mediocre weapons simply for variety's sake. What's also very surprisingly good in this game is the Nvidia PhysX that was incorporated. Seeing my transport truck's wheels constantly bumping up and down according to the land under me while I drive troops through the night is oh-so-satisfying as well as, well... realistic! The physics engine has been extremely improved and I quite like it.  I'd like to finally talk about how the guns shoot and how they sound, for this is after all, a big part of the game. Once again I will compare it to ArmA 2, in saying clearly that ArmA 2 featured a more high-pitched 'tappy' sound when you shot with vertical recoil, while 3 brings a much more deeper, louder shot as well as echo to accompany it as the gun travels backwards into your viewmodel as opposed to upwards. The guns definitely feel better for me, but in the end I'd like to classify this judgment as personal preference.  Lastly, the gamemodes of ArmA 3 are diverse and excellent, my favourite being Wasteland script. I won't go into detail here. There is also King of Hill, DayZ (OF COURSE, but it's MEH) and of course standard operations. Altis Life is also a really sweet one! Check those out if you end up buying.  So yeah, I really like this game and I think that there is so much potential for a growing community. Grab some buddies, hop into Stratis and keep overwatch with some snipers and riflers as you and your team move in through the bushes to grab an objective for more supplies for your squad! Really great game, I'd definitely recommend to any FPS/MILSIM fan! :D
98	1	a	surprisingly deep and addicting. Giddy up before the sequel releases!
793	1	a	A very fun game that has the best sense of humor since Portal! I first thought OMD! was a low-quality indie game, but it is actually a fantastically made, very well-presented title! The graphics and art style are gorgeous, the animations are flowing, the controls are super smooth, and the traps and sound effects are very impactful (pun intended). Basically, the art, sound, and controls outdo many AAA titles! Plus the humor, wow, this game is truly hilarious. I laughed so many times at the quirky humor. Although the defense aspect isn't super strategic and does rely on trial and error, it is very fun nevertheless. Plus, I love that I can employ my quick reflexes and twitch gaming skills to headshot Orcs left and right. Unlike other defense games where you often indirectly fight, there's always something to set up, shoot, or blow up. Overall, OMD! is nonstop carnage, mayhem, and hilarity! A true gem for fans of defense games, third-person action, and quality humor!
531	1	a	Not as good as the first.
1027	1	a	It you like tower defence action games, you have to play this one!
4984	1	a	worth the price
5	1	a	This is a really great and fun tower defense game mixed with real-time action game... once you get the hang of it. Not to imply that it isn't fun right out of the gate, but it doesn't take very long for you to sort of realize that the game wants to be played in a very particular way, and if you aren't picking up the game's hints, it can get frustrating. There are frankly a lot of things about this game that are VERY USEFUL INFORMATION that it doesn't do a particularly good job of explaining to you. Here are just a few examples of things that are confusing and will drive players to consult ye olde Google:  1. How in the hell does the skull system work...??? 2. I'm kicking a** and no orcs are getting into the rift, but I keep getting low scores...??? 3. I have no idea what I'm supposed to do with this steam trap...???  Here are the short versions to those answers:  1. For 5 skulls, beat the level, get lots of combos, don't lose any rift points, and beat the mysterious 'target time' that you have no idea exists or what the specific target time is unless you finish the level and select 'statistics' from the end-of-level options then look for the fine print.  2. Combos. It's not enough to just kill all the orcs and keep them away from the rift. You have to kill lots of orcs simultaneously, really fast, as much as possible.  3. The steam trap is a worthless piece of crap that does nothing useful (and it's not the only one). Just ignore it.  If you want to head down the path of victory instead of the path of what-the-hell-is-going-on, then here is where you should start:  1. Wind Bracers 2. Archers 3. Tar pits 4. Barricades 6. Ice amulet 7. Steel Weaver -&gt; Death Augmenter  You'll unlock these as you progress, but those are probably the most useful traps in the game. Orcs plodding slowly through a snaking trail of tar while 15 archers fire flaming arrows at them simultaneously? While you simultaneously use the bracers to blow huge crowds of them into a lava/acid pit? Victory.  You'll pick up more tricks and variations as you go. Swinging mace trap + tar pits = virtually unstoppable. Expensive, but heavenly.  Are fliers a problem? Or maybe ogres? Or maybe hunters? ICE AMULET THOSE A-HOLES.  It's really fun once you get the feel for it and find the optimal strategies, but aspects of the game can definitely feel mysterious and frustrating at first.  I'm just three levels away from 5-skulling the entire game. It's been a good time.
928	1	a	Almost no replayability and a pretty short game, but it was bloody fun.
4387	1	a	A really solid game with so much replay value! I recommend you to get Darth Mod for even more units and stuff to make the game a little better and deeper. 8/10 - Would want a multiplayer campaign
129	1	a	The name of the game is defend teleportation rifts from onslaughts of hundreds of orcs with hilarious lines. You can do this with several weapons, spells and strategically placed traps, all of which are unlocked one by one for completing each of 24 different levels. While the game probably won't keep you glued for hours at a time due to its repetitive nature, it's at least 8 hours in length or more if you hope to achieve 5 stars (or skulls in this case) on every map to get the most out of your trap upgrades. I for one love traps and defensive structures in games, so needless to say, it got all the more amusing watching my traps grow to an un-escapeable nature by the last few waves of growing orc numbers and other varying monster types. It's great casual fun with a nice challenge and I reccomend it to anyone, as long as you can get past the fact that the options menu is quite limited. Oh, and no re-bindable keys. For shame!
1396	1	a	If you like stategy game amd/or the 18th centry warfare? This game is perfect. Apart from some graphical issues and on easy or normal (which all the people who say the game's AI is horrible seem to play on) the AI is just about as good as a 3 year old child. Apart from that, the game offers over 10 diffrent nations to play as (each with their own starting areas, and unique troops) real time battles, naval battles, send trade ships to go get you trading goods to make a big profit from, and if i was to name all the reasons this game was great, the list would never end.Some of my favorite features are liberate nations(learn how to do by guides or the internet) and get protectorates, and wars of sucsession (which are normal wars but when you leader dies this is most likely to happen). Troops range from militia to the elite british cold stream guards or provencial cavalry (militia cavalry pretty much) to the polish winged hussars and even demi cannons (stationary, low firepower artillery) to mortars, howizters, normal cannons, to low firepower but mobile horse artillery. Or maybe want to be ahead of the other nations techonoligy wise? Build schools and colleges and send gentlemen theri to reaserch military tech, infantry like bayonets,0rtillery for better cannons and better amunition, or naval for better ships, speed and less chances of misfires. Industrail for your better building that get you alot of money, like ironworks, or to make you get even more money from them. And finaly is, enlightment technolegy. This is for getting better schools to reaserch faster, do research faster, better tax income, better trade and even some trade ports. Hope this helped if you want to know the very basics of this game (it is some what complex but it is still easy to learn
125	1	a	Veridict: 9.0  The protagonist will make you laugh your *ss off, while the tower defense style of this game will turn you into a fan of the genre. And if you are already a 'tower defense guy', then this title is a must have.  Despite it tower defense style, you can defeat most of the levels using only spells and weapons like a fire crossbow, a magic sword, bottles of acid and many other apparatus, just like a FPS/action game. Or even better, why not both? After you spread your vicious traps throughout the fortress' hallways you can equip one of your weapons of choice and slay any orc that pass through your killing machines.  Orcs Must Die! have a wide variety of traps, weapons and spells that you can use to stop the hordes of orcs from entering the rifts, you'll play it on the role of the last (and funnier/dumber) War Mage alive, and your duty is to defend the order and protect the land of man from being invaded through the rifts.  Fun is the only word capable of defining this game. And if you ended it and liked it, don't get emotional.. there's a sequel for this: Orcs Must Die! 2, so you can keep playing and slaying more and more orcs.
3280	1	a	This game is the definition of awesome! If you are looking for an in-depth, fun and great looking 4x turn-based strategy game with real-time battles set in the Renaissance Era then this is the game for you! I love this game! Empire: Total War will always be my favourite in the Total War series. I definitely recommend this game!
1818	1	a	This game is not as good as FOTS but it is still pretty good. The patches they have been releasing for years has definitely made the game much better (though it is still prone to glitches) I had a lot of strategic fun with this game and it can go toe to toe with Shogun 2 in some aspects.   If you want a more modern experience though, go with Shogun 2 FOTS. Unless if you think the 18th century is more interesting and you like line infantry combat more. Even though there is line infantry in FOTS it is a lot faster paced than in empire. ETW is a lot more like its time period.
2895	1	a	empire total war is GOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1639	1	a	This a great game for all you stratigic fighters !!!
