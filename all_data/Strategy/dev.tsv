255	0	a	repetitive and boring
512	1	a	Very addictive, gotta beat those top scores.
174	1	a	Blow off some steam and embark on a journey whose purpose is the total slaughter of orcs seeking a better homeland. Crush their dreams. 
3600	1	a	If you like Total War: Mideivel, you will love this game.
405	1	a	It was fun killing endless waves of orcs thats all there is to say. 
1255	0	a	Inside a Star-Filled Sky is a game developed by the lone indie developer Jason Rohrer. Inside a Star-Filled Sky is exactly the type of game I'd expect to see win some kind of award at the IGF - but winning an award at the IGF doesn't necessarily mean it's a good game.   Insidie a Star-Filled Sky is a novel concept and little more. The game itself is themes around the idea of recursion where you 'enter' power ups and enemies. While this is a nice idea it doesn't really impact the gameplay that much and each item you enter is effectively just the next room. I did appreciate the power up mechanics. You can collect up to 3 powerups and they can be combined in interesting ways to produce interesting effects. This fact alone, however, is not enough to merit a recommendation from me.  As a product, the game is very unpolished and feels like a prototype - for example editing the controls involves manually editing a config file. There's also no sound effects to speak of, just some ambiance music.   There are some nice ideas here but I don't feel the developer took time to flesh them out into a compelling gaming experience and instead delivered us a rough prototype.  Score: 3.5/10
869	1	a	Tower Defense meets Hack'n Slay Really funny to play and a tip for fans of Sanctum and Dungeon Defenders, traps can be a lot more difficult to choose and place cause each level requires different strategies. But compared to Dungeon Defenders too less possibilities to upgrade stuff and gain new one.
4479	1	a	Awsome strategy game
2765	1	a	You need to be able to change religion.
4291	1	a	TL,DR: If you like early modern history, or RTS games, you should definitely buy this game.  REVIEW  Empire: Total War was released in 2009 and I've been playing it since. It's an 18th-century grand strategy game similar to other games in the Total War series. This title focuses on rifle combat and line infantry; naval battles and trade and colonialization. Empire: Total War is truly a global experience as the game takes place in Europe, India and the Americas. Large battles between thousands of soldiers on land, naval battles with dozens of ships at sea and an enormous grand campaign map are the hallmarks of this game.  PROS  -Great graphics, even for today's standards -Balanced difficulty (Very Hard is quite a nearly impossible challenge; while Easy and Normal is not too difficult. I would recommend the 'Hard' difficulty setting) -Tactical gameplay is quite fun and engaging, especially at harder difficulties. The AI often notices your blunders and can counter them -Expansive game map provides hours of conquest and city-micromanagement opportunities -Diverse choice of countries to play as: For instance, Sweden and Spain provide completely different campaign experiences against different foes. The United Provinces (the Netherlands), for example, has a very strong navy and trade system but has only one province in Europe. The Ottoman Empire is probably the most fun to play as due to hardships in perhaps every category and the uniqueness of their units  CONS  -The AI is too stupid at times and they sometimes can't even respond to your attacks -The AI loves to troll you by just standing still immediately outside your cannon range. You cannot approach them without taking losses -Armed fortification battles can often be very buggy or against the player's favor, as the defending enemy will take very little losses unless you have a way to outsmart them -Almost useless Diplomacy at times. Very few opposing states will ever accept any agreement if you are at war with them, even to make peace on terms beneficial to them
3160	1	a	The first game I own on Steam and one of the best ones I played yet. It mixes some great battle scenarios and tactics and also very intense turn based strategy, where you have to be on the lookout for everything. Recomended for anyone.
2718	0	a	u cant play campaing mod with ur friend.I thought Ä± can Ä± bought now Ä± m sorry to Ä± bought
1410	1	a	i would not call this game great, but its good enough. its cheaper than napoleon, but the same when it comes to strategy and unit styles, but i like empires cmpaign becuase you have more places to go than europe, im not saying that napoleon isnt as good, its just that empire isnt horrible. i like the time period idea but it does not make the game great. it is kinda broken when it comes the naval battles cuase they are horrible to play. and some of the textures are not quite right for the units.i like the roleplay idea for the road to independence campaign but it needs great improvement. overall i would recommend it but dont expect much of it.
562	1	a	Gameplay is similar to tower defense games, but instead of towers, you defend rifts. You prevent orcs from crossing the rifts by setting up traps AND fighting them using your crossbow/blade/spells (3rd Person). You can also customize your warmage (minor spoiler) by using the weavers, which give specific boosts whether you prefer casting spells or being crafty with traps.  Highly recommended for the casual gamer, it's easy to pick up and go. Maps typically has 15 rounds which take no more than 3-5 minutes each (much faster if you are good)
831	1	a	A tower defence game that's all kinds of entertaining, engaging, and challenging. And while it has all of the usual trappings of a tower defence game, it also functions as a third-person shoter, allowing you to get in on the carnage. Use your traps and spells/weapons to liquify, crush, scorch, grind, and perforate thousands of orcs as they try vainly to infiltrate your castle. If watching orcs be electrocuted and set on fire while being sucked into a meat grinder is your thing, then this might just be the game for you!
1984	1	a	Basically kill everyone and take everyones land
4879	1	a	So there's nothing particularly amazing about this game, but it's got a charm that keeps drawing me back to it.  Asteroids style top down 2d space shooter. Collection mechanic, Level up mechanic, resource gathering and shopping mechanics, something of a randomly generated map, but effectively the game doesn't change a lot between plays.  Very satisfying explosions :P
336	1	a	Hours of fun, recommend especially if you enjoy tower defense games.
3926	1	a	This is my Favorite Total War game to date, I still like it over Rome 2. and if you install DarthMod it is truly Amazing
5200	1	a	Played tons, great game
1631	1	a	This game is interesting. I love the Total War series in general. I have been a huge fan of them for several years now. This game is good and bad in multiple ways. It has a lot of interesting history to it and a great play through. The command interface is rather simple too. The downside is that the game frequently will crash if you don't have a super computer. I give this game a 6/10.
4388	1	a	This game was vilified when it first came out, right after Medieval II. Now we all wish CA would still make games like this.   PS Play with Darthmod or don't play at all, IMO.
2951	1	a	Amazing game, but sometimes broken. Hit or miss, but I got lucky.
1677	1	a	Amzing game wait for it to go on sale tho last sale it was only a dollar
5208	1	a	I spent 72 hours in the game so far. It's like 3 days and 3 nights of addictive fun for 10 EUR. Worth it.
3912	1	a	Simply one of the best games ever. After a rough start, after all the updates and the mods from the community, this game is a jewel.
4631	1	a	It's a game about space pirates and then later there's zombies and now there's bounty hunters.  What else do you even need in life.
802	1	a	All the same things from Orcs Must Die 2 apply to Orcs Must Die. If you own both games, the levels from the first can be played from within the second game. I'd recommend playing it from the second game as all the new customisation features will apply to first game's levels, and you'll be able to play as the sorceress.  If playing this from the first game there are a couple of things to note:  * Its customisation system is not nearly as good as the second game. * There isn't as much variety as there is in the second game. Applies to weapons, characters, traps and monsters. 
1682	1	a	one of the best games i have ever played
2301	1	a	Best Total War period so far, Best Grand Stragegy maps, but worst A.I. 8.7/10 Hope CA making this great period on Empire : Total War 2 next time.
5206	1	a	I'm in space. SPAAACE!
4209	1	a	Very nice game.
2147	1	a	I love building empires in the this. The global aspect of the game makes this total war version much better than the previous ones... at least in my opinion. Diplomacy still sucks in this game though, absolutely no one wants to trade even though it helps their economy too...
99	1	a	If you haven't got this game yet, get it! It's simple but fun, and challenging to get 5 skulls on each level. Truly a great find in 2011 gaming!
3531	1	a	its very nice!!
137	1	a	Orcs must die! is fun to play and has epic music.The warmage also has some funny things to say during gameplay.
3859	1	a	possibly the greatest game ever created...ever

5080	1	a	Like Space Games (check), Like free flowing story games (check)  then why not check out SPAZ, it's a 2d take on the older elite and frontier games and it doesn't disapoint, with many ways to customise you own fleet of little space ships and tailor there weapon systems and defense to your play style  and for the price this game is a bargin, so fancy a trip to the center of the universe in search of treasure and fame,  then buy SPAZ
56	1	a	A solid 7/5 this was probably how I got a rollie coastie headache. I'm sure though that this game will be fun. I promise.
3475	1	a	Empire is the first total war with multiplayer campaign, however you will need to download the beta on the site, and so to register on the site, thing that it seems you can do again at this address:  http://www.totalwar.com/en_us/empire-multiplayer/  Between empire and napoleon, i prefer campaign on empire, because the periods of time show severals big factions by alliance (and not only france in one of them as in napoleon), and empire is ok for land, but not for sea, because naval gun range make little ships shooting farser than big ones. Prefer napoleon if you want the newest one, as it has less bugs and more improvements, is ok for both land and sea, and has multiplayer campaign this time available, but with problem of save. Sea battles on these games was epic.
1972	1	a	Would be more fun if you could shoot your retreating soldiers..
3762	0	a	The game has some serious bug-issues. Pathfinding is broken, diplomacy makes no sense, units stutter their actions for no reason, turns take ages to skip thanks to the game-breaking 'Ottomans bug' that was NEVER fixed. You basically rely on mods, forums and research to play this game in a semi-stable condition (with emphasis on 'semi'). This game is seriously broken.  The graphics are good, but animations and level design are sub-par at least. Cavarly fights are disgustingly bad animated, as an example.  AI is poor to say the least. But being honest, AI is completly undeveloped.   It makes me sad for two things: first, I don't like throwing away my money. Second, the developers probably saw potential in this idea, but then they took a gigantic dump into it, put a few naval battles and released it. To this day, the game looks like a BETA.  If you value your money, your time and your sanity, don't buy it. If you want to try it on a discount, GET MODS (darthmod kinda fixes the game, kinda). If you still wanna buy it for some reason at full price, well... enjoy throwing your money. Seriously this game is a huge dissapointment. Do not buy.   4/10 in vanilla. 6/10 with mods.
1996	1	a	i do recommend this game i like it it was my frist game and i think you should try it 
2218	1	a	How am I writing a review for this. I don't own this game. Good job steam. So yeah, I'll reccomend it, not that I've ever played it.
941	1	a	Excellent game, one of the best trap / tower defense type games i've yet to play.  The graphics are good for what it is, the game runs very smooth and is nice and fast paced. Excellent game, certainly worth looking at.
4947	1	a	Great Space game. Addicting! DL the demo and try it out!
1239	1	a	A really fun and simple tower defense game. Looks quite nice too and has some fun maps. Quite cheap and provides some good fun and challenges.
4489	1	a	Surprisingly good  A 2D space game complete with 2D graphics. You have a special mothership that can bay a couple fighters, you move around galaxy as a merc team collecting resources, fighting, making pacts, upgrading your fighters, and finding off bounty hunters.   Part of the game is incredibly fun, some of it is incredibly tedious, but overall its great.
644	1	a	There's so many positive things I can say about Orcs Must Die. It's a game which won't disappoint even the most hard to please gamer, as It's packed with so much fun, humour, and thought.  Orcs Must Die is more or less the same as Plants vs Zombies. It's a game where you must place traps in order to stop the horde of enemies from reaching their goal, and every new level brings a new trap. With every new trap of course brings a new enemy, so be prepared for this when organising your traps. Aswell as traps you can also use magic, and choose upgrades through-out the various levels through a card system.  Being as this is the first game from Robot Entertainment, I give this game a big 10/10. There isn't many people who won't enjoy this game. It's pretty hard to find weak points. There's few bugs, has good graphics, and overall perfect gameplay.  Pick this awesome game up at any opportunity. You won't regret it.
262	0	a	Didn't do it for me at all. Part of the joy of tower defense is watching your little machine devour enemies. I didn't enjoy running around inside the machine in some kind of mediocre 1st-person shooter. This made the game less fun for me.
2462	1	a	really good game :)
5256	1	a	Great game!  I had an absolute blast playing through spaz and would definitly play it again! This well crafted 2D game builds up quite nicely and is longer than I expected which is really nice for a change. I love when I unlock the ship im gunning for and unleash a can of tracking laser beams onto an over-eager enemy! Then throw the survivors out the airlock just becasue I can hahaha!! At least thats how it goes on in my head.  Would be nice though if the galaxy was divided into a few more factions, besides that its an all round 2 thumbs up!!
1471	1	a	Empire: Total War takes us away from the battlefields of both Ancient and Middle Aged Europe and Middle-East and takes us to the Empires of Europe during the 18th Century. Muskets and Cannon now determines who is the most powerful in all of Europe, Improved graphics and gameplay makes the game more exciting and stunning for Total War fans. Campaigns follow George Washington as he revisits the past from the development of Jamestown (1607), to the French and Indian War (1740's to 1750's), and to the American War of Independence (1775-1783). Not only can the battles between the European powers take place in Europe and the Middle-east, but also the Colonies of North America and South America and to the Colonies of India. Trade and expansion is key to your nation's victory, expanding out to colonies and your Empire's borders are crucial. The century turns to the the advancement of technology and development of new forms of Government. A time when the system of Monarchy seems to crumble while Republics and Democracies rise. Revolution and Colonization has made the 18th Century one of the world's most crucial centuries in all of the World's History. Will you reign or will you revoutionize a new Empire, the choice is yours. The times of Royal familes and difference in social class lays in your hands, will you preserve it or will you destroy it?
1084	1	a	This game is much more fun than it has any right to be. It's a blend of the Tower Defense and First Person Shooter genres, it's extremely frenetic, and the main character is an entertainingly over-the-top â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. If you're not sure about it, grab it when it's on sale; it's a pretty minor investment for a solid game.
1133	1	a	This was a really great game; dynamic gameplay, somewhat developed characters, and a variety of mobs to slice and dice. The traps are good, but I definitly fell into a pattern of which to use/which were the most useful. Definitly good, pick it up!
2313	1	a	Its so much fun
4454	1	a	Still waiting Microsoft Studios announcing AOE IV
3107	1	a	this game is really good the sea battles are brill. the land battles are good (can be a bit slow)but altogether a very good game good for the price and very beautiful. 9/10
4875	1	a	You get to explore space, customize and upgrade your fleet, and fight zombies.  Plus, Totalbiscuit is the narator.
1376	1	a	i didnt play a lot of time before i saw that i play of of the best RTS games ever! this game awesome! big map, lot of nations if u buy total war game buy this! 10/10
2828	1	a	Played as Britain, (RULE BRITANNIA!) killed a bunch of colonials, got taken over by Iroquoi cause I went bankrupt. Indians beat the mightiest empire on earth.. 10/10 would buy again
2522	1	a	I got this game for free but i havent even beaten the tutorial...
3222	1	a	This has always been one of my favorite strategy games of all time. Very good rts feeling. Really cool to see such realistic historically accurate units, borders, and buildings, + strategies and menuvering. If someone is up to a challenge the campaign proves to be highly difficult with levels of critical thinking and strategy. Both the land battles and naval battles are well laid out. 8.5/10
149	1	a	Simple but very enjoyable. The main character is grand enough.
5324	1	a	Children play Call of Duty Boys play Battlefield  Men play ARMA
1176	1	a	Amazing rebirth of one of the best RPG - Estrategy games. They impvoved a lot the graphics, incuide vegetation (also vegetation animation), water and many things more. I like the new interface too. its more intuitive and the info of the units are better explained'. I have to say that, for be playing just a cuple of hours, is much better than Renaissance and Resurrection.  The only things that i don't like is the music loop. In a battle never change, its always the same since the beginning (like a repeating track). You have the option for make it random, but its buggy.  In the other hand, all the other things are correct (or more, they fixed a lot of bugs and errors). If you like this kind of games, this is your oportunity to get it for an amazing price :)
3250	1	a	I got this game because I saw a friend play it for quite awhile. I was not disappointed. Do you like tactical games? Do you like history (Especially periods 1700-1799)? Do you like to build an empire and watch as it expands from France to Russia? If you answered yes to any of those, get this game, and you won't be disappointed either.   (Plus, the TF2 items are nice)
2950	0	a	All in all it is a good game, but it is not a good Total War game, in my opinion. If you think that Total Wars should be all about real time strategy, then be my guest, this is the game for you, and I would definitely recommend it. However, if like me you think that Total Wars should be less about taking an army and smashing a lot of heads, and more about taking a country and leading it to create an empire, then steer away from this game. First of all, I feel that the great improvements made to the RTS part ended up emptying the TBS part, while Total War games before this one always pursued a balance between the two aspects. Now, the campaign map is simply too easy - in particular because the other factions don't even try to really resist to your invasion, but counteract with a small-scale guerrilla in your conquered areas. It would be a great idea, if it wasn't for the fact that quite soon you get so rich you don't really care about them burning down some buildings, when you can afford to rebuild them every single turn. No matter how awful your faction is, you are going to conquer the world on the campaign map, unless you really wanna play all the battles and lose them all spectacularly (generally, even auto-resolving battles works well enough to ensure your supremacy). Then, the disappearance of the family tree - it might be more realistic and historically accurate (since when do Total War games care about that?), but suddenly your head of faction is just a name, and your generals are just a special unit you need to create an army; no traits, no marriages, no fidelity, nothing really has any influence on your gameplay. Finally, the cities - once upon a time they were living entities, which had meaningful unrest, visible growth, different needs and different buildings, peculiar to the faction, the historical period, the culture, and even the region. Now, you have five slots, with a limited choice of buildings. Trust me, you are going to build EXACTLY the same buildings, in the same order, in every city and with every faction. What's the point of having a technology tree if you only have a bunch of buildings to build?  But they gave us ship battles, that makes up for everything, right?  PS Don't be confused about my gameplay hours - I played at least three complete campaigns, but offline.
5249	1	a	Awesome throwback to the days of Armada. Lots of fun.
1210	1	a	Deeper customization than Disciples 2. Cooler animations and great one-more-turn gameplay!
4421	0	a	everytime im i start a new campaign it crashes just after it loads, i used to play this game and i loved it, now the longest i can play is 1 min because of the crashes
519	1	a	Mega funny game to burn hours of time into, highly reccommended!
4002	1	a	A man 99 years old, lays dying on his deathbed.... My life.....tis the end.....*gasp* (reaches for laptop) Maybe....maybe i can just have one more turn...   8 years later he finally dies....  Yes...this game is that powerful.....  dot dot dot dot
4728	1	a	enjoy what it attempts and how it's all put together, balance the part that seems wobbly... or maybe it's my shipwright and space captaining skills
4124	1	a	I reccomend this game and there is so much rubbish crashing and lag but the overall gameplay is ok. After rage quiting and breaking your screen there is a strategic game behind the pants finish and please don't play on easy, give yourself the most elite army ever and call yourself a hero after beating one unit of puckle gun.
448	1	a	For me this is the best first person / tower defense hybrid there is. Beats Sanctum IMO. Set the Standard.
2796	1	a	Like strategy video games in the mount and musket era with world domination and combat in different continents such as america europe and India and more? Like strategy video games in the mount and musket era with world domination? Like strategy video games in the mount and musket era? Like strategy video games? Like video games? Like strategy? Like games? Games? Then buy this.
1827	1	a	Well very hard to win for me even on easy but have to admit spent many hours playing this game.
4538	1	a	Recommending this.  Game was developed by 2 people (and it was developed to the end, without any BS kickstarters that end in â¥â¥â¥â¥). Game has progression system (leveling and building of a fleet - the fleet is not big, but you can customise individual ships to your liking). Story is not too bad, need to read the crew chatter inbetween chapters to get the feel for it...story is narrated by TotalBiscuit btw.  for 2 Eur ? It is a steal, complete steal. Also, mods. Also, sequel is coming...
426	1	a	This is honestly one of the funnest games i have EVER played. A smart man with $15.00 would buy it. Good story, GREAT gameplay. Awesome visuals. This game is a 10/10 in my book. Will be buying any sequals.
1888	1	a	&gt; Be Marthra Confederacy &gt; Remove kebab from india. &gt; Remove silly christians from india. &gt; Have no one to remove. &gt; See middle east. &gt; Remove kebab.  10/10 would remove from premesis again.
1616	1	a	excellent game, best of all total wars
613	1	a	Great game, â¥â¥â¥â¥ you coal and coupons.
500	1	a	Best TD there is.
1256	0	a	Perfect example of how NOT to use procedural generation: as the content of the entire game. This is an unfinished program with no vision. Your only purpose is to pilot around from randomly generated level to randomly generated level finding better upgrades so that you can kill the enemies in the way more easily.
1824	1	a	One of the best Total War titles! Totally beats the older ones, it brings a LOT of new features compared to them and that are the new standard on Total War series, including Naopleon and Shogun 2. Nothing but a kick â¥â¥â¥ game!
52	1	a	There is: -Deadly Orcs -Some really deadly Orcs -Orc friends to are trying to kill you -Lots of killing -Lots of traps for said killing -Lots of ways to lay said traps -Lots of options for said ways And lastly, -One crazy witch  Need I say more?  GET IT.
3292	1	a	Not bad. Through it could use some tweaks, its a game you want to play.
1362	1	a	Extemely good. Total War with guns.
4208	1	a	great game , have spent hours playing
2513	1	a	Hey guys, quick question!. When i play Empire , everything goes well, until after the first 200 turns. Once i hit the 1800 mark , after i finish my turn , the game decides to stall on one country and it takes forever I.E. The Maratha Confederacy . It literally takes between 5 minutes to I â¥â¥â¥â¥ you not 6 hours before i can keep playing. I have a decent laptop and it works great with Napoleon and other total war games. So , What's going on here? has this happened to anyone else? Appreciate some feedback guys. Thanks
1767	1	a	Started up 1st game of 2016 played as prussia -went to war with poland -rekt warsaw in 2 turns - went to war with hannover after being besties because they wouldnt give me denmark -reking hannover as we speak 11/10 would rek poland again
3277	1	a	pretty good
4067	1	a	First time I played this game I loved it...and still do after years of playing.
2323	1	a	this game is awesome
4556	1	a	great game to play helps me to lose myself in the game at least lol cant wait till the second one comes out
3940	1	a	I can't stress this enough but I literally spent one whole week during summer 24/7 when this game first came out building my empire and loving every single minister, general and admiral who did me proud.  I had one Admiral who was pretty much the head of my campaign in the Americas being at the head of every naval battle imaginable. He gained several traits and accolades including a very charming parrot I named Jerry. So anyway the Americas Campaign couldnt have gone better I owned the sea and the land now all that was left was India so I sent my fleet and my well seasoned admiral across the great ocean blue. Few turns later maneuvering my troops through europe and persia the tell tale ding ding of my ships arriving in indian waters. Yay. Then followed an all too familiar ding ding. The Admiral had died of natural causes on the voyage. Spent twenty minutes in shock wondering who would take care of Jerry.
1778	1	a	Excellent game, It makes you wanna learn about 18th century Europe!
1423	1	a	Outstanding. This is one of the most advanced, one of the best strategy games I have ever played. If it had custom empires/custom maps, it would be my favorite game. Ever.
2864	1	a	etw is a great game if u like rts games and history. There is a great variety of units and countries. however the one bad thing i have found about this game is that you units sometimes will move to get to a position in a way that makes no sense or if you want several units to turn around sometimes they will all swap spots for no reason meaning that your unit on your right flank will run across your line to reach the left flank while your unit on your left flank runs to your right.   overall i would score this game a 8/10 though.
2859	1	a	My Funniest Game of This was when i played . with Darthmod combined with all nations mod as Genova And Conqured whole of europe exept Holland. then conqured half of india and then 40% of america then realized i was making 200k Per turn and dident know how to spend the money so i retired
3324	1	a	At first I was really hung up on this game, but with the time passed I notice a lot of drawbacks. the biggest of them must be the diplomacy system, which is virtually non-existing (as the title suggests it is a 'total war', but that does not go well together with the period setting in 18th century) and then the battle system in which the units clashing in melee combat always only fight one on one. So even if you send 200 men against 5, in reality only 5 of your 200 will fight. this is driving me crazy especially when you see that it is the sort of legacy which is in these games to stay. I am not even thinking about buying Rome II, now. it seems that the sequel has taken a turn for the worse.
4324	1	a	A wonderful taste of Grand Strategy RTS, and a wonderful entry title to the Total War franchise  If either of these interest you then definitely buy this game, it'll be worth every dollar
1208	1	a	this game contains Russian Inquisition - 10/10, would play again  similar games: DotA 2 (also contains Russian elements)
1993	1	a	Still one of the best strategy games I have ever played.
1718	1	a	Empire: Total War is amasterpiece of the total war series, it was my first game on steam and i still play to this day. 420/10
2347	1	a	Fought pirates in a thunderstorm.
799	1	a	Orcs MUST die! Just as the title states! 5/10
3751	1	a	An awesome mix of Turn-Based Strategy and RTS mixed into one. Very awesome game!
1166	1	a	Reincarnation, indeed. It feels like the game was reborn. Visually, it's the same. Internally, it's a new game.  It has become more complex, more complicated in terms of combat: party-to-party battles are more diverse, action-filled, and enjoyable now. RPG elements grew a bit stronger, being felt more distinctly than before. But what's the most important, endless bugs that haunted the players of original  Disciples III: Renaissance  are now fixed. Maps are loaded instantly, parties are never teleported to the city they have last visited, bottomless treasure bags with hundreds of potions inside are gone, a party can now enter the city (and not just stand next to it), game doesn't randomly crash anymore...  Playing Disciples III has finally become a pleasure.  If you had painful experience with the original game, never hesitate, get this. Troubles are gone in this edition.  If you are new to Disciples, then I'm telling you that this is a step-by-step strategy slightly influenced by RPG genre. It tells a story of several races fighting for dominance in the world of Nevendaar. Each of these races has their own goals, but their paths are constantly crossing, resulting in fierce battles. Control the resources the map has to offer, make small parties of soldiers where every fighter has their own unique skills, choose the way they will progress by means of building certain structures in your capital, and fight numerous foes to gain experience and treasures (including new weapons, armor and other stuff for your character and other party leaders). Some people say that it resembles Heroes of Might and Magic; of this, I cannot tell anything, because I never played the latter.  So, this day has come: I can now recommend Disciples III. So great to see this wonderful strategy series getting what it truly deserves.
1117	1	a	Fun little game. Easy to pick up and just play. Snag it if its on sale.
844	1	a	Two words best describe this game: fun and addictive. Few things are quite as satisfying as defeating wave after wave of orcs with all sorts of traps and spells.
1051	1	a	If you watch the trailer you know what you are getting. Cartoonish entertainment and high speed action. If you like the trailer, you`ll like the game. At least I did
4217	1	a	Second line of defence shot first line   11/10
2372	1	a	Best Total War to date. Love it.
1304	1	a	Easily one of the best war games I've ever played, set in a fascinating period of history with an extensive map stretching over North America, Europe, the Middle East and India which you can conquer and I was glued to the screen for nearly 80 hours. One of the best PC games I've played to this day.
988	1	a	What a fantastic game. I really love it. Fast paced action combined with some strategic thinking, a healthy dose of Bruce 'Ash' Cambell style humour. Devilish traps and some well thought out weapons. This game has also really has made me laugh a lot. A very enjoyable and polished game that you can have a quick game of or spend hours playing. So much fun to be had and lots of replay value.
1083	1	a	Fun, clever, and just the right amount of arcady. I hope they make more like it.
2336	1	a	byu far the best total war game there is i have played everyone of them and the story and play of this one takes the top spot. i love this game
2375	1	a	it can be a little slow but wth the ability to conquer America Europe and India this is one of the biggist total war games i have played.
2043	0	a	this game is fun untill it stops working not worth 20 bucks  '
3444	1	a	I played Rome: Total War and loved it and wanted to play Empire: Total War and finally was given it by my wife for our anniversay, but she purchased it outside the Steam system. I pplayed it for 0ver 480 hours and had the same problem time and time again...game would stop working and I would loose my saved game at times. I asked people who had the game and they said it was because I got the game outside Steam and Steam didn't provide help or updates for me. I was about ready to stop playing but looked in the forums and found a temporary solution that proved to work for the most part have played 54 hours now somewhat free of this problem. I have Windows Vista for an operating system. I do like the game, but think that some tweeks could be done. Diplomacy really bites sometimes, at the start it isn't bad, but later in the game sledom do you get accepted when you offer anything reasonable...they want the world and offer you nothing. Plus it seems as the game turns against you if you are the powerfull country...I ended up fighting almost all the countries left in the game. But I still like to play it. One thing that would be nice, if you overrun artillery units you should be able to use them in the game.
3839	1	a	Great game for those who love that miniature field army expierence brought to you by the Total War team. Also what I would consider a good starting point for someone looking to enter the Total War franchise or RTT/Turnbased Strategy gaming. The most played game in my library, last CD based PC game I ever bought and the game that brought me to steam.  10/10  (PS I highly suggest looking into mods for a challange such as Darthmod)
4770	1	a	SPAZ is a top-down space shoot-em-up that has pretty graphics and some nice RPG/upgrade elements for a variety of unlockable spacecraft. It's a great game to play when you need to kill some time, but the repetitive missions keep it from being much more than that. However, SPAZ is a great companion to FTL: Faster Than Light; where FTL requires you to adequately manage infrastructures amidst turn-based combat, SPAZ does that â¥â¥â¥â¥ for you, and lets you just kill things in real-time until you get bored.
3612	1	a	It is a great game with stunning visuals. Far better than Rome 2.
4030	1	a	its fun playing in 3 days then you take a break
3903	1	a	Great game,will keep you busy for many hours..............
4155	1	a	Nice Gameplay. Interesting historical elements. Camera Control sucks compared to Medieval total war, but enjoyable gameplay.
3322	0	a	Not that great. I thought I would like this a lot more, but it's not nearly as fun as Rome: Total War.   The naval battles are fantastic though, so that's pretty fun.
1100	1	a	Amazing Bruce Campbell-esk main character? Check. Mindblowing trap combinations? Double check. Lots of Orcs? Like you have to ask...
3440	1	a	A very good game but has a few week points in the gameplay forinstance the game play is in the players advantage nomatter what difficulty it is at forinstance India should not be able to take on major world powers in europe in the early stages of the game and win plus the AI run enemy are too easy
2741	1	a	This game is very good i love it!
2302	1	a	Complete AWESOMENESS!!!!!!!!
4339	1	a	Definitely one of my favorite Total War games. I highly recommend Darthmod in addition- Empire is known for its epic scope, Napoleon for its polish, and Darthmod makes Empire a bit more smooth.
398	1	a	Possibly one of the greatest tower defence games i have ever played.
1729	1	a	All i can say is this: WAY WAY WAY BETTER THEN NTW, THIS GAME ROCKS (except for creative assembly's racism towards muslim factions,mainly The Ottoman Turks) but overall get THIS GAME NOW!!!!!!
1012	1	a	Kill Orcs NOAW!!!!!!!!  Lovely game if you like some melee/range combat fused with traps. It's a bit of a tower defense if you ask me.
596	1	a	I bought this game expecting to maybe play it for an hour and move on, but I ended up marathoning it from start to end. The gameplay is fun and innovative (you get a feeling of reward for creating complex traps and you really develop your own playstyle as you go), and the characters (that is, yourself, the mage, the enemy leader and the orcs) are easily likeable. I recommend it to anyone who's ever liked a tower defense game.
3855	1	a	Most AWESOME game of it's genre.. Honestly, haven't played a better game. It focuses on both realism and logic, which makes it twice realistic. Not to mention the perfect battle animation and design. Historical background is also correct and accurate. Most exquisite! Big THUMBS UP!
1085	1	a	4 out of 5... cool traps, decent different types of enemys. NOT MANY LEVELS... you can get many more from dlc I think u should try this game
4724	1	a	Fantastic game for the money, highly recomended, the controls and concepts easy but the game isnt. a real challenge buy this when its on sale.
1651	1	a	Empire: Total War was the first Strategy game I've played. I saw the game and said 'Hmm, looks cool'. I downloaded the demo, and spended about a day, playing each mission.  Then i bought the game. It was amazing. Commanding my first empire was a blast, conquering Indian Tribes, and sailing to the Americas, discovering new lands. The AI wasn't the best, so I took a break and downloaded Darth Mod.  Then, I jumped back straight onto the game with Darthmod UC. Then I started my 2nd Empire. I realized how better it was, and much more challenging. I kept Darthmod, because it improved graphics, and AI. Then I got used to the game. I decided to begin a bigger Empire with much more enemies. I started focusing on Economy and it really helped. I got trade and towns up. I got so much money, that I made a huge army. I felt so good.  Thats when the colonies decided to declare independance. I got pretty mad, so I discovered I could have relations. Know I knew alot of the game. I was ready.  I sailed with my allies to the new Americas. There, the war with the Rebels lasted 3 Years in-game. I had a blast battling. I gave some land to my allies in the Americas to avoid rebels. I took the Americas back for myself then. After I had conquered most of the Americas, I decided to move into uncharted land and waters. I found tribes, and made allies, and made new enemies. I was amazed by the game. I conquered many new lands, and made many enemies.  My empire became power hungry, and I fell apart. I was so happy, and I enjoyed myself. Just next time, hope to lead a more successful empire.  If your looking for a game like this, buy it. The AI is not the best, but there are mods that fix the game. The modding community makes some cool things  Rating 9.8/10  AWESOME GAME!
1050	1	a	Forget the later OMD games, this is the one you want.
5028	1	a	Not many games like this these days.
5149	1	a	I'm not the type with time or patience for complicated games, however this game is not too simple that it's boring, and too complicated that it's tedious, it stoke a perfect balance for me. This game has an old school feel, I get a nice nostalgia feeling playing it, it's my favorite game at the moment.  We need more games like it, gameplay &gt; gfx ANYTIME !
1998	1	a	I played a mathara confederacy (spelling) and defeated the mughals, i then proceeded to take the middle east and go north through the caucaus, defeating russia with sweden. I gave sweden sri lanka earlier but then i realized i needed that to win so i broke our alliance and took it back, me and sweden are now worst enemies and im taking the balkans with my army of european-indian soldiers. 10/10 would â¥â¥â¥â¥ sweden again
4145	1	a	omg buy this game instead of something like world of warcraft. If you like history of course. the game goes awesome when you add fifes and drums in the background. good times..... that was 5 seconds ago but..... good times
4025	1	a	Really wish it had co-op campaign :(
1790	1	a	barnsy is love they say barnsy is life
833	1	a	Excellent tower defense game, I recommend!
4807	1	a	Highly recommended.
1179	1	a	All the problems that you've faced in the previous Disciples 3 editions have been pretty much sorted out. Reincarnation is the master bugfix, and adds a lot of quality of life changes to the game, such as healers in the party taking one last move at end of combat to heal up your troops before you head out, and adding a more streamlined progression system for skills and levels.  To those that have never Played a Disciples game, the soundtrack and visual style are gorgeous, and the gameplay is very enticing, with lots of options to play it straightforward, or grind for the perfect team compilation. If you want an awesome turn based strategy, you have found your mark. As a long-time fan of the Disciples series, I can finally endorse Disciples 3 with Reincarnation; it has made up for what its two previous installments lacked.
3742	1	a	Complex, rich, addictive strategic game. Great mix of turn and real time strategy, now even multiplatform. Take it, you won't be disappointed.
1844	1	a	Flawed but absolutely brilliant.
2334	1	a	This is simply one of the best strategy games i've played ever. You'll eventually get tired of it, but the gameplay hours it will provide you are almost endless, mine are 300 hours of quality gaming in an inmersive atmosphere with an awesome background music. It's a 9.5/10.
824	1	a	This game is awesome - I haven't had this much fun since my wife got her hair caught in the tumble dryer.
2053	0	a	This game is very entertaining to play. However, the Steam version of it is awful. I have yet to actually beat the game because when I get around 3/4ths of the way it crashes and the autosave file ends up corrupted so it can't be loaded. Total War games have always been great, but do yourself a favor and get another version.
4055	1	a	Classic total war but with a twist I wish they would make another one but perhaps based in the Victorian era ? there are a few problems with this game mainly that units such as the line infrantry all look the same for any nation apart from the specials and colours this seems to be the same for all nations I would recommend this game but like all total war games you need to be interested in the era it's based
1562	1	a	Epic game, I can only recommend
249	1	a	6/10 It's a pretty dull Tower Defense game (replace Tower with Trap), but at least the opportunities grow with your inventory. Still, it's fun every now and then. But not as much fun as Plants vs. Zombies. *hint hint*
1626	1	a	Just four words: I Love This Game!!!!!!
2272	0	a	lacking the co-op campaign.. idk why the beta is not a dlc, really lame..
705	1	a	This is a pretty awesome game, don't let the Orcs invade your Castle
1581	1	a	Great game and one of my personal favourites in the Total War Franchise. I'd just wished they'd add a co-op campaign.   8/10
3499	1	a	If you love the series or just love strategy games, this one is for you!
880	1	a	Wacky, wonky and tons of fun. easy to pick up, hard to finish.
1749	1	a	Good game. easily worth the $3.74 on sale offer.
3902	1	a	Always loved Total War series. And i was not disappointed when checking this one out. My 2nd best right after Medieval II. Campaign 10/10 Battles 7/10 A.I. 6/10 Graphics 7/10
2426	1	a	one of them games that you can't play for just a few mins as it turns into hours
2422	1	a	Now, the Total War series has to be one of my absolute favorites. Empire: Total War continues that awesomeness. One of my favorite features of these games, especially this one, is the way you can drastically change history. As Prussia, I have claimed Austria and Bavaria, kicked the Italians out of Venice, Italy, and turned the entire European world against Sweden. Now, these are the things I have done. What I do then effects what other nations do as well. Spain destroyed Portugal, Great Britain is now killing off the Indians before the colonists have even gotten the chance to have a revolution. The French and Indian war? That has come 40 years ahead of its time as trade with my spectacular Prussia has boosted the British economy to crush the French. This isn't just some turn-based game either, it CAN be just that if you'd prefer, but if you want more from your ordinary turn-based game, Empire: Total War sends you into the musket fire. Let me be honest when I say the only dissapointing feature of this game are the sieges. They show the buildings the enemy or as well as yourself have built, a barracks, or the government buildings, but thats pretty much it. Maybe 1-5 buildings inside fortified walls. The older Rome Total War's would give you many houses and organized streets unlike the newer Empire: Total War. Don't get me wrong though, it is still very fun to charge your infantry into the broken walls of an enemy fortress. If you want to succeed at this game, whether its simply to control 20 other regions or to dominate the world, just learn from past mistakes in history. Bring your small nation to become a world power capable of pulverizing Spain, Great Britain, and France. Good luck with your world domination!
976	1	a	Its a cool game my friend gave it for my bd :D 
2584	1	a	10/10. Just look at how many hours I have played already!
4721	1	a	This game is beyond awesome. It's a little mix of Space Rangers, Freespace and Elite with a great story and a TON of content made by a tiny 2 developer team who created SPAZ because no one else was making games like this anymore. Support indie devs and support one of the best genres of games that has all but died off in the age of 3D graphics. Buy SPAZ now! I mean it.
1240	1	a	One of the best Tower Defense games I ever played..
1278	0	a	Pointless.
2158	1	a	A lot of fun, some nations are far more challenging. Advancing in tech is fun and is awesome when you overtake other nations in certian tech, but you can also sell tech to help with the constant need for more $$$, especially when at war (which is almost constant with someone). Fun to expand to other continents and to fight wars all over the world. A.I is sneeky, treacherous and sometimes overly aggresive and often unreasonabe in negotiation.   -Graphics are great, and manageing your nation is fun  -A.I battle tactics land and sea are fairly smart and challenging but not impossible  -Really fun battles but massive opposition forces make it time consuming for conquest. Rewarding when you have more wealth and security   -Bankrupting rival economies causes rebellion in their lands and can bring the existence of new nations friendly to you and can buffer you from hostile nations. (AWESOME!)
2894	1	a	when i downloaded this game the tittle and words glittched out and when i re-installed the game it still was glitched...can someone halp?
573	1	a	Awesome, and addicting, Great DLC, great gameplay, and it's really fun figuring out a good way to lay things out. If you like tower defense games, like DD, then this is the game for you!
309	1	a	You grin with malignant satisfaction as you watch the Horde of Orcs slog through tar, pelted by arrows, dying in scores, whilst their numbers are also gradually being decimated by wall mounted blades, crushed by crushers, knowing that, should one of the kobolds manage to survive this, the lava awaits.  (cue maniacal laughter)  MUHUHAHAHA...!
2871	1	a	*Plays as the British *Captures Paris, the French Capitol *Rebellion happens *Crushes the rebellion *2 turns later, rebellion happens again (facepalm) *As rebellion keeps happening, I have trouble keeping up my income so I couldnt replenish troops because they keep destroying my surrounding buildings while I have other armies focusing on India and America *Loses the French capital (FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU) *5 turns later *Recaptures the capital and crushes their independence *Spain declares war on me and blockades me from sending reinforcements (more fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu) *Spain demands peace if I sell the capital to them *Gets the shotgun *Shoots the computer *RAGE QUIT
1750	1	a	After playing Medievel Total War 2 for a long time, this really blew me away. Initial release was a buggy affair (not as bad as most modern releases), but true to form, CA fixed the game. Any tactics you learnt from earlier TW games, chuck them out off the window - rifles, cannon and lightning fast calvary are the main flavours. Long range muskets suffer poor accuracy, but like in 'ZULU', wait until you see the white in their eyes and open fire - devastating to numbers and morale. Naval battles are a hit and miss, but again you have to read naval tactics from that era - rake your cannon fire as you pass their broadsides and stern. Can be satisfying if you reduce their sailor numbers and capture a heavy flagship.  A great addition to any TW fan's collection.
4606	1	a	It gets a bit grindy, but it's still a fun game.
795	1	a	It's tower defense, but without all the boring.
4167	1	a	Empire Total is a good game that makes you decided on critical issues relating to you empire, what would have made the game better is only they had a more countries or empire you can rule over, other than that out of 10 I would rate the game at 9.5,
120	1	a	Dunno what to say. If you like tower defence, play it. If you like OTS madness, play it. If you like crude humor with soho accents, play it.
2020	1	a	The game is good and classic TW game, but battle bullet animations are a bit old. This game was published before Shogun2:FotS, so the bullet animations are a bit old and buggy.   But anyway good old classic.
4244	1	a	Great game! one of the best strategy games since cossacks :D                
1034	1	a	If killing orcs is wrong I don't want to be right.
2735	1	a	When dungeons and dragons is just not enough...        10/10
248	1	a	 This game is like Tower Defense except you get to be a part of it! A third person shooter game where you set up defenses to prevent trolls and other troll variety from getting too many to the exit. While you also shoot and stop them ontop of it! While trying not to get killed by them. Sad part is it's only Single Player, that's why I only play the second game with my friend.  9/10
4160	1	a	Actually cant even see my mouse inside the game I guess I could recommend this game to others
4810	1	a	Hey you, yes you... if you gonna sell Space Pirates and Zombies 2, make it cheap! 'cause I'm gonna buy it.
2030	1	a	Play as the British  Take over the world Avoid Brexit Avoid Trump Drink Tea  10/10 would re-write history again
2554	1	a	Satiate your hunger for world conquest. Manage the economy, sciences, diplomacy and military. And like always, field and command vast numbers of troops on the field of battle! Go out, and conquer the world! I like kicking butt with a Native American tribe. Conquer the world with the Indians!  My only regret is that South America, Africa and Asia are not included in the game. I want to be the Incan god of the world, not just the Andes!
4823	1	a	This deserves to be on your Indie Games Done Right list. Spaz has you going around the galaxy fighting diffrent battles as a merc unit, you origionaly can only control 2 or so ships but eventualy can control 3, the sizes of the ships allowed changes as you play and there are a LOT OF SHIPS, around 8 for each of the 4 sizes. As you play the campaign you can unlock the various technologies, there being around 16 each with 10 levels, this making your ships more effective in that tech and unlocking the more advanced versions, the end result being an amazing amount of customization. Fun as hell game.
1308	1	a	I have never been disappointed by any of the total war series. Empire is certainly one of the best. The land battles, and the sea battles are epic. Diplomacy can be a bit difficult, and empire management takes more time as you progress, but it is all worth it in the end. Do yourself a favor, and get familiar with this one. I would give it a very high score.
3108	0	a	Could have been a good game, it is was without all its bugs, still not resolver in 2014!!!! Some sieges make even the best computer lag like hell; saves can become corrupt (cool your whole game is lost!)... And also ennemies who don't attack in a siege... Elite units packs are a pure waste of money.
674	1	a	Are you a MASSIVE racist that hates orcs for no rational reason? CONGRATULATIONS! Play this game, and you will have your reason, because they're being bad and invading your rift. You are a loveable idiot (So just like real life), who can dance like nobody's business, and he's humanity's LAST HOPE against the incoming Orc threat. Set traps, headshot orcs, and become the orc-discriminatory hero that the Rift needs.
4558	1	a	I played this all the way through (offline) back in the day. It's strange because the shallow gameplay would normally cause me to give it a thumbs down, but there is something about this game that got me totally hooked and I've recently played it halfway through again. Now that I've come here to write a review I've discovered that SPAZ2 has just gone to early access and the video for it it making my heart thump already. Anyway, back to my review...  Cons (none of which matter to me)  The game universe is enormous but to be honest all a bit samey. You have to complete endless tasks to gain the technology and resources to upgrade your ships, but these tasks mostly involve battling enemies which is really the be-all and end-all of this game. In theory you're supposed to tailor your ships/weapons to the task at hand, but in practice it doesn't really seem to matter, you just equip the best weapons you can find and use them for everything. It's not the most intellectually challenging game.  Con (which does matter)  There is a storyline to this game, with an ending. After it had finished, to my dismay, I discovered that it was impossible to go back and play some more with the massive battleships I had worked for hours on end to build up. Bear this in mind before you tackle the final task, or make a data backup!  Pros  It's all about building bigger and better ships with more and more firepower and watching the battle mayhem. Especially towards the end of the game when huge battleships are blasting each other to smithereens it's a sight to behold, and the amazing thing is that all this glorious graphics action doesn't seem to lag or stutter at all, it's smooth as silk.  Now enough of this, I'm off to buy SPAZ2!
4390	1	a	where do i find mods for this
4876	1	a	Probably one of the best sci-fi games I've played.
2324	1	a	first total war game i played and second favorite (shogun two is my favorite), i played as russia and i completely wrecked the whole ottoman empire in around 2 hours. it is very easy just to pick up and play without a tutorial. things i like - routing system - being able to switch to melee - taxing system - techonlogy tree - ai declares war on people that they did in real life (russia-ottoman empire, austria- poland...) i would recomend this to my friends  10/10
4633	1	a	Best space top-down view game I've played in a very long time. I've spent hours and hours playing this game. This game is very indepth, ship customization is great, and the story is incredible. I would recommend this game to anyone how likes...playing games. You have the option to have two AI ships follow you around while you do missions, or take control of one of those ships to diversify the way you play (or when your main ship explodes). There are numerous missions to do, at times it does get repetitive, but the intensity does increase as you plan on with loot to take. There are a lot of solar systems that you can visit, and the way you interact with each faction helps determine, what weapons are readily accessible for you to purchaes or scavenge. Down side: I have to wait tooo long for the sequel.
421	1	a	before I was a lad i killed the orkish folk.
2246	0	a	Mass gun fights and total war don't mix well, in my view. The worst of the series.
4361	0	a	How do I even play this game? It exects you to just jump in and control everything, there's no tutorial on controlling the nations and I'm garbage at this game.
1265	1	a	Inception:The Game
3478	1	a	Great Game!
5239	1	a	Is SPAZ really an offensive title? Who says SPAZ anymore? Am I SPAZ? These are questions we need answered.
3635	1	a	Medieval Total War II was the king of the strategy genre! Although not quite as good this game still delivers. Definitely worth a play
3154	1	a	Once more unto the breach, dear friends
510	1	a	Lot's of fun. I enjoy it a lot.
3369	1	a	Very hard at first but if you stick to it you'll soon see its an amazing game! Highly recommended however you must realise it's extremely hard at first and you must be willing to learn how to play! NOT A SIMPLE GAME
5185	1	a	
2530	1	a	very great RTS with huge battles on an epic scale. Great for those who enjoy Risk, The Civilization series, or even the past total war games.  Pros -Graphics are amazing -Lots of mods, I recommend (Darth mod) -Big battles -Sound is great -Refreshing new take on the Total war series  Cons -A.I is really dumb -Requires a pretty hefty machine to get the fullest out of the game. -A bit buggy  9/10
582	1	a	This is the perfect game to just start blasting away at every once in a while. Don't expect to get caught up in it for more than a few days, but while you do, it's great. Plain old orc-blasting ogre-hacking fun. Classic hack n' slash that's simply good at what it does.
5114	1	a	Great Space game. Addicting! DL the demo and try it out!
662	1	a	A great mix of Tower Defence and Shooter .
3686	1	a	This is an outstanding game. Lacks some factions, continents and useful technologies, but, in all, it's a great game worth of spending many hours playing. Goes better with the Darthmod pack, but without it, it can still be played with some pleasure. **Some**.
3134	1	a	This game i great for history buffs,begginers or people just looking fer turn based strategy. Many campaigns and challenging gameplay make this game great. Only problem is laggy online gameplay, but that can be overlooked.GREAT GAME!!
246	1	a	OMD is an entertaining, furiously addictive mixture of 3rd person shooter and tower defense, with a splendid soundtrack that perfectly compliments the frantic action. You play as the rather dense but â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ure Warmage, who must defend the magical Rifts from untold numbers of marauding orcs, using an array of traps, guardians, spells and weapons. The main game of achieving a 5-skull rating (no orcs escaping, within a par-time) on all maps is a good challenge - which further fuels your abilities at large-scale orc maiming, as skulls can then be spent to upgrade your equipment. Slaying the hordes is plenty fun enough, however therein also lies a complex combo-system adding much further depth of play, where the more traps and their afflictions hit an orc, the higher the combo-points, thus making every map replayable to experiment and chase that higher score. Crisp graphics, great voicing, music, humour and still packed with pure, fun gameplay that's as good on a pad as with a mouse. Quality arcade action that's only surpassed by it's more content heavy sequel, yet still worth playing first.
2153	0	a	Broken garbage. Installed for a matter of hours before grand campaign games could no longer be started or loaded, I was worried about this happening because of numerous problem reports around this game but went ahead and bought the package deal over the weekend it was on sale. Now I like many other good folks am left asking questions about how to fix my game only to get the same old BS 'delete you user script/preferences/creative assembly folder' line that DOES NOTHING!!! REFUND PLEASE.  And you wonder why people pirate so many games. Disgusting.
4094	1	a	one of my favorite total wars. mix in some banished and this game would eat my life.
3598	1	a	best game i ever play   In this game there are swords and guns and horses and spears and elephants this game like a world war every army and state has a special ability   Army Indians that they have units remain hidden even when walking and I love this thing much
1736	1	a	love the game, need to make more countries player acessable like portugal and i would love to see a empire total war 2
1196	1	a	A very good and absorbing game. I am not sure what was wrong with the previous versions of Disciples 3, but this one is great. I am told that you have 120 hours of game play here. For the price it's a must buy.  It took me roughly a hour to get the hang of the game, but now I have a pretty good idea of what I am doing. The atmosphere and graphics are wonderful, the sound and music is good. I can't really find fault with the game.
860	1	a	Highly responsive (UI, sound, controls) FPS tower defense game with a great art style and direction. Leaderboards incite long-term commitment and replay of already consumed content, and the death animations are hilariously fun. Highly recommended for anyone looking for an easy to pick up and fun short game session.
2454	1	a	Change history in a game of Empire: Total Embargo.
4995	1	a	It's like space pokÃ©mon. Not in the way of being space pokÃ©mon, but as in you have to be a bit OCD and enjoy grinding. Definitely has its wobble-wobble-click moments, though, but if you have bad luck they can be few and far between. The strategy is actually pretty deep once you get used to hammering the space bar and pointing ships places and holding onto your precious goons. I have played this game for 36 hours, apparently, and I haven't even reached the zombie level, so it's pretty long, or I'm pretty terrible. If you're a bit CDO (hahahaha), and enjoy min-maxing and â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ off the pigs, I'd completely reccomend it.
575	1	a	great game, a lot of fun
151	1	a	I am an avid FPS gamer, and despite my tendency to skimp on other genres, I have to say, this game is excellent! Great for killing time. Lots of colours and goofy traps.   It doesn't however feature a coop mode, but fortunately that was introduced in OMD2.  A solid package all around :)
2654	1	a	Disclaimer: I am a Total War fanatic; Now that I have said this, Empire is not the pillar of the series; but still it is a solid and deep stratagy game even after 6 years. The main campaign is ok, but the Grand Campaign is one of the strongest of the series, and much of the asethetic makes the Victorian Era come to life and a salute to Creative Assembly for creating a line infantry system that works fantastically, but in retrospective the system seems completely achieveable, but in 2009 the system was ahead of it's time.  8.25/10
4843	1	a	Fun game to play when you have no internet
893	1	a	This game is very addicting and stessful at times but it is a lot of fun.
2108	0	a	Most terrible total war ive ever played.   Seriously the cavalry AI and the infantry AI is sooo dumb  do not buy this game
1611	1	a	  F*** naval battles other that gg
245	1	a	it's like skyrim with orcs
1092	1	a	Simple gameplay but very enjoyable and replayable.
3687	1	a	Similar to other games from the Total War series Empire is a good strategy game for those who like early european history. There are some excellent aspects such as what your country's exports. I still like the Rome TW games better, but thats just me
3386	1	a	Great game, especially when combined with some mods, but requires really good computer in order to play in High/Very High details.
957	1	a	this game is like a tower defence on crack, its exstremely fast paced wilst most other TD allow you to take your time and think things out, this one gives you a chance to think out at the beginning but as soon as you start it you gotta run around and spend your points on the fly and it can make you panic at times, which is alot of fun at times
2586	1	a	Like all 'Total War' games, the game must use mods. More so with Empire as the finished game plays more like that arcade game you used to play in the fish n chips store. I would recommend 'Darthmod' as a complete overhaul of the game. Turns Empire into how it was meant to be.  Not entirely stable. Especially with mods, but worth it.  Make sure you can run the game smoothly with unit scale set to max to get the best gameplay.
3996	1	a	Realy Cool Game (BUY IT NOW ! )
2055	1	a	The best game, really enjoed the many hours playing Empire, Total War. 
3471	1	a	great game, have spent many hours on this game and really enjoy all aspects of it!
3629	1	a	I'd say play it if you love the gunpowder combat. It had immense potential and nailed many of the goals, but ultimately was a let down for me. That being said I still dump hours into it for the sheer scale of it. With mods it becomes a VERY good game. Worth it if on sale.
4004	1	a	Conquered Spain as the U.S had to deal with spanish uprisings best game for â¥â¥â¥â¥ing up history poi
4115	1	a	Awesome game! If you like games like Age of Empires or Stronghold, you will love this game. It is similar to other strategy games, but the battles and many other aspects are different.
733	1	a	Interesting game~
2965	1	a	balls at velocity simulator 10/10
2676	1	a	I really injoy this game as you can see in my profile picture my favorite nation i love using is the the 13 colonies(america). Try the demo and if you like it GET IT!!!!!!! is a really fun game.
8	1	a	Stay away...too addictive
4279	1	a	This Total War game has the one of the largest if not the largest campane map of all the Total War games. Its also fun to watch lines of musketmen fire vollies into one another and watch huge wooden sail ships blast broadsides into one another.
3054	1	a	While the Total War franchise as a whole is quite excellent, Empire: Total War remains my favorite of the series. It does an excellent job of representing the era it was placed in, there are no commanders necessary to raise armies as is required in the newer Total War games, and I prefered the region management system more, with individually upgrading farms and towns instead of having only so many slots per region for buildings. The AI isn't the brightest, but the gameplay is very different every run-through and it is very rewarding to take a small empire like the United Provinces and conquer the entire conquerable world.
1813	1	a	After playing this game for a few hours I rate it as one the the greatest real time strategy games of all time. Equally fun if you take a hands off approach to your battles and rely on the auto resolve funstion or take control against insermountable odds and use keen strategic placement of your troups along will real time battle manuevers to outflank and crush your foes.   Varying nations have different bonuses and starting situations. A multitude of possible alliances and backstabs are possible and achieveable by various means. Placate your population with religion, sorted diversions or military presence or victories. Utilize the same to dominate a conquered populace and/or turn them in time to your loyal followers. Infiltrate opposing countries with spies, assasinate or sabatoge as you go. Send out religious emisaries to turn populations to the one true religion. Train researchers to bolster your war technology or steal/trade it from another country.   The Grand Campaign is amongst the best offered in any strategy game and was probably the best at the time the game was released. So many factions to conquer. So many alternative routes to take to world domination. Replayability is off the charts.
416	1	a	really a lot of fun if you like tower defence/shooter/'strategy' games
4540	1	a	It is fun to try and find the best weapon &amp; upgrade combos. Looking forward to the sequel!
3330	1	a	Absolutely AMAZING! Ive spent loads of time on this and i'm still not bored of it! Great if you play 'the last samurai' 's theme music during a sea battle, as the ship goes down. So funny and it seems like a real movie! I don't think i'll get bored of this game quickly:) Would be better if you could play as more countries in the campaign though, but that doesn't take anything away from the awsomeness of this game:D
286	1	a	Fun trap/tower defense type game Fast paced, easy controls, funny and engaging story line, without feeling too heavy. A great game to sit down and waste time playing and having fun, without having to make those long term commitments, and planning out your future needs for characters etc.
3882	1	a	This game is great!just wish I had more play time,lol
4111	0	a	First the game seems very buggy two instances are in defending forts where if an attacking unit is positioned near a corner they seem to really suffer low casualties, also at times the fort is damaged, but I can't repair, and often the enemy is suppose to be attacking, but just sits there or just bombards with artillery, which doesn't kill many units, and takes forever. Also you can't extend military access and the battle screen doesn't let you know where you are. Intercepting counts as defense, which is fine if they would just clarify that you can defend a bridge by staying in the fort behind it. Also not allowing multiple units in buildings just seems wierd.
3601	1	a	the is a instant favorite....if your into history based strategy games check this one out highly recogmend it even being played on low graphic settings still worth playing and eventually invest in a new rig to play it gloriously in high or ultra high so you witness even the smallest detail
3750	1	a	im bab aat the game but i love it i had so much fun in mitiplayer.
4302	1	a	I love this game because you remake history.I've still have yet to take over the world (but Austria has tasted my warth).
1448	1	a	One of the best strategy games ever! Must have game!
3350	1	a	I really enjoyed this game! It was a very good game and worth buying.  My favorite part was the naval battles and the sieges, but the graphics are all over the place!
188	1	a	+1
3818	1	a	&gt;New campaign as Russia &gt;Its a bad country, everyone is poor, at war with surrounding countries &gt;Sweden has a bigger army than Russia &gt;Decide to change Russia &gt;Invade Crimea, Georgia and Chechnya &gt;Putin did this &gt;I'm Putin &gt;Flash foreward &gt;Invade Sweden &gt;Win Swedish capital &gt;Make peace with Swedes &gt;Invade Poland-Lithuania &gt;Win game  Putin/10 would Russia again
3572	1	a	If you like Civ V but also like Age of Empires, Total War as a series offers the best of both worlds. The overworld campaign is a turn based strategey, but when two units collide to battle, you control the units as the game becomes a real time strategey. No economy to set up in game, what you bring to the fight is what you get to use. There really isn't anything that compares to the Total War expierience, so check it out!
2967	1	a	Playing as Great Britain(I am using the darth mod as well) thinks about what to invade sets his sites on denmark comes in and takes denmark and later norway leaving the danish on iceland  takes iceland  celebrates decides to go into america  arrives in america  deploys troops on the coast of georgia attacks georgia to help my war against the iroquosi confederacy wins georgia  descends into the carribbean starts taking the pirate owned lands  some how destroys pirates????? then takes dutch guyana(the united provinces had been destroyed) my low horrible income turns into inflation goes into india takes the previously owned dutch land ceylon  declares war on the italian states  sends troops into italy  wins it over  moves my troops back into america  bullies the cherokee taking florida and another territory in the same turn moves north takes the kaintuck territory and also tries to to take cherokee territory fails being outnumbered by 2000 with 2 substantial armies  glitches when about to take the general out suddenly like 1000 troops just appeared out of no where ends battle  rages  im still a good conquerer
754	1	a	Good game, but short.
274	0	a	Happy plus ONE.Less in an hour,think I'm not that naive.
4678	1	a	This is one of the best indie games I have ever played.
2587	1	a	good , but crashes a lot, for some reason in the best part of the game.
4913	1	a	Arcadey 2D space combat, exploration, ship customization, and zombies? Yes please.
4592	1	a	SPAZ is yet another game that the screenshots and trailers do no justice. The game was made by only two people.  The universe you are set in is randomly generated and has a small amount of customization in size. The smaller the universe, the harder the difficulty between each galaxy. The bigger the universe, the longer the overall game and the more stretched out resources are. The game tells you not to do your first playthrough on the hardest difficulty. I immediately went and ignored this because I love a good challenge.  And boy does SPAZ deliver. You have up to three of your own ships in play at once. You can manually control one of the three ships at any time and the AI will take over the other two. The combat can go beyond mindlessly killing at times in the harder difficulties and thought is needed to plan out what you are going to do. Getting a game over is rare but progression is also challenging.  Good for casual and hardcore players. I'd write more but I've run out of room.
4754	1	a	Great game. Replay value is high, too.
2560	1	a	Empire Total War is by far my favorite strategy game. The game play is superb and the campaigns last for hours and are really fun. I have played this game for way longer then I should have but this game is so addicting that I don't actually care. I have played this game for awhile and I don't plan on stopping anytime soon.
1203	1	a	If you like the Heroes of Might &amp; Magic series, or turn-based RPG's for that matter, then I highly recommend this game. The combat is a little simplistic compared to the M&amp;M series, but it is still alot of fun.
1413	1	a	this game is very historical one of the best games ive ever played
1458	1	a	Amazing game. Good graphics Nice storyline. This game got it all
2555	1	a	While this game can prove to be buggy, and a bit irritatiting at times (especially in naval combat), the overall experience is unique and intuitive, with the increasing importance of artillery and ranged combat changing the dynamic of the traditional battle formula.
1674	1	a	After playing 1678 Hours of this game, I can say it has faults.  Ottoman Empire bug and the lack of formation lock can make the game frustrating. However the tension created when your army starts to lose and you struggle to fight with only one cannon and a few half strength units is palable and if you acheive victory the elation is real. Excellent Game made better by community mods by Darth MOD and Bran Mc Bom.
3767	1	a	I played this game a lot on my dads account, it was great so I got it for my account. It is worth the money if you have an average computer, it is really worth the money if you have a great computer.
4653	1	a	I ended up putting in way more hours than I ever thought I would in playing this game. All in good fun, though. It's a good top down space shooter with a lot to do, some quirky humor, and several different ways of playing (though maybe only a few work best in Insane difficulty -- canons and stealth are your friend until you build up the tech to face things head on). It can be a bit grindy at times, especially when you get to the Zombies part of the title, as you'll want to acquire powerful tech and ship blueprints to deal with them (and this goes double especially on Insane difficulty). But, if you get into it, you'll barely notice all the time pass until you've suddenly put in over 100 hours.   A good, well-put together game at a cheap price. Worth the full price. A no brainer when on sale. :)
677	1	a	There are a lot of orcs in this game. They all need to die.  The story isn't great but the game itself certainly is. The game is challenging but can also be played in an easier mode if that is more your cuppa tea. For the die-hards, there is also a nightmare mode. Finishing the game for the first time should take a reasonable amount of time (&lt;10h). The replayability is good though, the achievements are fun to try and get, and generally not of the grinding type. Since the way to play a level will completely depend on how you approach it (which traps you use, which weaver, etc) you can do a level multiple types without feeling like it's always the same thing.  It's a lot of fun to find and try out new methods of making Orc-paste (a)
2558	1	a	An awesome strategy game, It does not hold your hand in any way, leaving you nearly infinite strategies to use to conquer your opponents
4450	1	a	When I first got this game 10 years ago on DVD I fell in love with it from its gameplay system to its story. This game is what introduced me to the RTS genre and it is because of this game that RTS games are what mostly fill my steam library. Overall with its two amazing dlcs i think this game is well deserved of an extremely good review.
1644	1	a	8/10 
972	1	a	Very fun and entertaining game! I will definitely buy OMD 2!
2626	1	a	Good Game Love IT
4056	1	a	ItÂ´s Good game if you have nothing to do. Long gameplay and good multiplayer.
4223	1	a	This is on of my favorite games to play on the PC   I give this a 10 out of 10
3124	1	a	THIS GAME IS INSANE!!! I ENJOY IT A LOT AND YOU MUST BUY IT. SINGLE PLAYER IS AWESOME AND MULTIPLAYER IS AMAZING. GRAPHICS ARE REALLY GOOD. BEFORE I BOUGHT IT PEOPLE WERE SAYING THAT THERE ARE NOT MANY PEOPLE WHO PLAYS MULTIPLAYER BUT WHEN I BOUGHT IT I SAW THAT THERE ARE A LOT. 15$ IS NOTHING FOR THIS AWESOME GAME. YOU SHOULD TOTALLY BUY IT!!!
3085	1	a	i would say this is by far the best game in the series
1078	1	a	So addictive!!!!
3698	1	a	The most underappreciated chapter in the Total War franchise. The inclusion of regular gunpowder troops changes the field of battle radically from previous games, but at the same time opens up a whole new avenue of tactics and strategy. Definitely worth playing, and did I mention you can conquer India?
5097	1	a	Fun, simple gameplay. Manage a small fleet of ships and save the galaxy from zombies.
520	1	a	This is a great example of how to combine action and tower defense gameplay.  Gameplay is very fun; the variety of weapons and traps gives you plenty of ways to complete most levels. However, some traps/weapons need to be upgraded before they're useful IMO.  The art style, soundtrack and story (what little story there is) are all fun and upbeat, and make a very fun atmosphere. The little amount of dialogue is gold, too.  Nightmare mode is exactly what is says on the tin.  Absolutely recommended.

1692	1	a	Get some tea and Crumpets...ah What the hell freakin' buy this game!
2724	1	a	BEST strategy game I've ever played!
3775	1	a	You have to download DarthMod and Causa belli in order to make this game's FUN AND ENJOYABLE
1237	1	a	This is a standard tower defense game, reasonably well done - you have the standard decisions to make of which type of turret to place and where to place it stop the waves of enemies making it to your base. As you kill enemies you earn money to either build more defenses, or in later levels to upgrade existing turrets to do more damage and/or increase their range (if you have unlocked the higher levels of that turret type).  The weapons are fairly well spread with clear differences and advantages which are fairly intuitive/sensible - machine guns fire fast but low damage and short range, artillery is slower but harder hitting and with bigger range, AA guns can only affect planes, etc. Equally the enemies have a decent variation - easy stuff for the beginning, then you will usually get mixtures of fast low armour units, slowish moving tanks, and so on, so you can't just build one type of turret and leave it at that, usually every wave you are having to react off what is coming and beef up the turrets of the appropriate type or add new ones to deal with the every increase numbers, speed or toughness of the units charging at you. Oh and then a wave of bombers comes onto the screen and you suddenly need to place down a couple of AA guns near your base, etc.  There is certainly nothing special or innovative here, but it is a solid tower defense game that is pretty well balanced, and could act as a good starting point to learn the basics of the genre, or just a more casual atmosphere and challenge than some of the more in depth/complex or genre blurred variations on this theme (Tower Wars or Defense Grid or Sanctum or Defender's Quest etc)
3858	1	a	An extraordinary game, one of the best strategies I've ever played. Love the TBS mixed in with RTS (land, naval, and seige battles). Keep up the TW series, Creative Assembly.
494	1	a	Killing orcs is so much fahn.
3819	1	a	One of my favourite Total War games. My only complaint is that there are too few playable nations. It would have been nice to be able to play as, say, the Mughal Empire or one of the many minor nations in Europe.
2605	1	a	Great game definetely recommended.Try out darthmod or imperial splendour, you will be blown away!
1547	1	a	Epic fighting on battlefields from Russia to Cuba. Fight to create America or rule the world with an iron fist... or mabye a musket.
2250	0	a	DO NOT BUY! Game is BROKEN. The game is designed to be run in 1280x1024 resolution. Anyone playing with a more standard resolution (1600x900, 1440x900, 1366x768 ect) will experience BLURRY text. Enough to make your eyes hurt after only 2 minutes. It is a game breaker. There is NO solution to this problem, and there never will be. DO NOT BUY. NOT worth any amount of money. A shame too, the game itself is pretty good, but the blurry text makes it unplayable. Anyone out there who wears glasses or contacts: Imagine not having them and going about your day without them. Constantly having to SQUINT to see anything. This is what ETW is like, except squinting does not help. Nothing does. A fundamental game flaw. A great game ruined by one simple dev mistake.
2770	1	a	An awesome game that even shows some of history. It's a nice mix between turn based strategy and real time. I've played every Total War game so far this one was a blast to play.
2235	0	a	UPDATED REVIEW: After playing this game further, I have better reason and judgment as to why one should not purchase Empire: Total War.  Let me begin by stating that I love Medieval II: Total War. It is by far one of my favorite games of all time. I purchased Empire thinking that it would be a logical upgrade from Medieval II. I was immediately disappointed by the extremely long loading times, both when booting up the game and launching or loading a campaign. I intially thought this was due to my laptop's admittedly-low-quality specs, but was reassured that this was a problem within the game itself when it persisted on my desktop, which can run Battlefield 3 on the highest settings and maintain a steady 60 fps. I was then further angered by the unreasonably low amount of playable factions, especially in comparison to the large amount of unplayable factions.   When in a campaign, unlike Medieval II, one must govern the farm, port, town, and city of a region. For example, the city and region may be Magdeburg, which may also have a small town, farm, and port. All of which have individual troops and buildings to manage. This becomes incredibly intricate and annoying to manage as your empire grows to encompass much of Europe, India, and the Americas. The troops and buildings cost an incredible amount of money to purchase and maintain, and the amount of money you can earn is low in comparison. Like Civilization, one must research technologies to progress through the game correctly. These take a tedious amount of time. If you slack or forget at any point in your campaign to research a new technology, you will almost immediately be left in the dust by your AI enemies. Speaking of AI, the AI factions of Empire have no sense of diplomacy whatsoever, especially when compared to the nonplayable factions of Medieval II. They'll go to war with you simply because you share a border, and will end a truce or alliance a turn after it is made. Total annihilation is the only fate for any faction in this game.   Graphically, the campaign map is awful. It ditches the semi-satellite-image style of Medieval II, and tries to portray a tapestry or painting globe. This style fails, and ruins any seriousness that the game's campaign has. Also, the in-game text is terribly small! I have 20-20 vision, and can barely read the in-game tips, notifications, and other text. The battles, however, are very nice compared to Medieval II. The particle and weather effects are upgraded heavily, and soldier models have a lot more fidelity. Battlegrounds and scenes are a lot more varied and detailed.   The mechanics for battles are essentially the same as Medieval II, but Empire is the first in the series to introduce naval battles. Do not expect an Assassin's Creed IV experience. These naval battles are incredibly difficult and clunky. It's a lot of fun to witness AI battles, but to actually commandeer a fleet is too daunting and annoying to enjoy.  All in all, if you're looking for a first taste of the Total War series, or want to relieve what the series was like in its earlier days, do not purchase this game. It ditches the realism of Napoleon and simplicity of Medieval II, and falls flat on delivering any sort of strategic or fun experience.   Seriously, just play Medieval II.   OLD REVIEW:   As are most Total War games, this is a must-have for RTS and simulation fans. However, if you are a fan of Medieval II as I am, you'll find this game takes a bit getting used to, and is not as good as M2. For starters, the map and map style are not as realistic, ditching the photorealism for a revolutionary-era styled artsy map. This heavily effects the quality of the game, as you feel like you're playing a Total War variation of Civilization Revolution. Also, just like civilization, Empire introduces technology research, which incredibly slows the pace by which you play. Because of this, the play style in the campaign is almost nowhere near how you would play Medieval II or games prior. But, these are nearly counter-balanced by the shear map size and number of playable factions. All of Europe and North America are conquerable, as well as India and some parts of Africa and South America. Coastland Asia, Oceania, and other parts of Africa and merely used as trade posts.   One element that ruins this, however, is how irrational and warmongering the NPC factions are. Almost all of your neighbors will end up going to war with you, no matter how much you try diplomacy, appeasing, or just plain being an isolationist. Just like Civilization, a country will swoop in and take your provinces without any warning, and the game's economic system will force you to spend a terrible amount of turns preparing armies before you can actually defend yourself.   Basically, this is Total War: Civilization. If that suits you, go ahead and buy it. I'll stick with Medieval II.
3525	1	a	This game is a large leap from previous titles, but in a good and east-to-learn way. Overall combat works great, perhaps I say better than Rome and Medieval II (HERESY!) , and the economy is easier to build than in previous titles as well (for the better, as you are given three large theatres of combat that you have to finance eventually). The addition of researching technology for military, industry, and philosophy makes competeing against other nations even more fun and challenging to get that edge over them. An amazing experience to those familiar to Total War games, a must have for those who love RTS's, and a great game to learn the Total War series from. Recommended.
3881	1	a	This is a really good game, but if you are still deciding weather to buy it or not i would wait untill it goes on sale closer to christmas time.   9/10 great game
4104	0	a	I've found it difficult to play, and I think a big reason is that I've already played Shogun II. Obviously, there is going to be a step back in terms of gameplay systems and graphics because of age, but there is something about this Total War game that seems clunkier than the rest.
5036	1	a	My only issues were...  Pacing: It felt like it took forever to upgrade the mothership and I ended up using the same ships for hours. Also if you need resources it's kind of a grind to accumulate them. And the upgrade system kind of keeps you locked with regard to what weapons you use. Switching to a different weapon type costs you all of the upgrade bonuses which typically doesn't work.  Saving the game: If you get invaded when going to the mothership to save, you could be forced to fight another 10-15 minutes of ships and reinforcements before you can save the game. I just ended up getting bored of playing and quit without saving.
3638	1	a	great game love can't stop playing it for me 9 out of 10
2885	1	a	Great game, likes to eat many of your hours! It is possible to win in many aspects, like just keeping your own country in europe without expanding, and going full for the trade and maintaining your fleet, or try to conquer on european soil itself. Perhaps in india? It is all possible.
3435	1	a	Endless hours of reliving and reshaping history for those who are captivated by this time period.
1971	1	a	i like it but it needs a work shop
1908	1	a	cav. just use cav. always use cav.
997	1	a	It is very fun. You can hear the Orcs say 'It's my last day before retirement' and than give him a headshot. But if you have (hopefully) friends that play video games i highly recommend you Orcs Must Die! 2, because this is a lot more fun in co-op!
3999	1	a	Just outstanding...
3774	1	a	very fun game, very well done, NOTE on easy just train cannons,howiters and rilfes and gg you win  best game in the seris from the 3 i have, i love it because the artillery has infinite ammo, giving some importance in killing enemy atillery
4949	1	a	After following the development of this game for a while I am pleased to say that the wait was worth it. As with games like Terraria and Super Meat Boy, do not be fooled by the simplified graphics as it more than makes up for them in playability and addictive content.  The game universe is HUGE, hundreds of star systems each with multiple planets for you to explore. Each planet within a system offers missions or events for you to encounter. As you complete one mission another is generated as the universe evolves with every action you take.  On release there are over 30 ships for you to obtain and dozens of technologies to research. In order to advance the available technologies or ship designs you will have to blast your way through the galaxy and salvage the blueprints and data you need.  The only criticism I would make is that there is no multiplay feature but the developers are continually adding content to the game and hopefully they integrate multiplayer mode(s) in the future.
1916	1	a	This game is amazing, Darthmod adds even more to it
3665	0	a	Was a good game, stopped starting up, other people had this same problem. Tried alot of methods from the forums, piece of crap.  It feels like this, and Napoleon are two halves of something great, that could have happened but didn't.
4064	1	a	I have only played one game.... that is all.  10/10
2204	1	a	WHAT A GREAT GAME THIS GAME IS.
5201	1	a	This is very nice This is a complementary review.  The difficulty settings are thouroughly thought. Any complaint about difficulty, rebuilding, etc.  Is the player's fault. The difficulty settings, and map/campaign customs at the begining are directly related to adapt the game to you. if your a massive noob, choose the according settings!  This is a complementary review.
906	1	a	If you are looking for a Insanely fun and bloody TD/TPS,If you like killing orcs,Then this is the game for you! Orcs must die! 1 has many unique traps,weapons,trinkets and spells which you can experiment or play with,I recommend that you play this before you play the sequel because it has a story to it,If you don't like singleplayer tower defense/third person shooters then go over to the sequel if you like :P I want you to grab you're money and buy the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of the game because it is â¥â¥â¥â¥ing worth it and i like you to play the game for yourself because i don't want to spoil all the stuff it has :P
5325	1	a	I got PTSD from this game.         In the most immersive way possible.
1421	1	a	By far the best strategy game i've ever played. The scenarios are fantastic, but the story mode is even better. They've thought about so much creating the story mode and it is all so damn realistic! If you're looking for a fun game to play- yea play this game. 10/10
4311	1	a	Yes although not very recent and poor graphics at some stages it can be extremely fun to go into battle
1180	0	a	This game probably plays very nicely; however, there is literally no support for the game for modern computers. I am trying to run it on a high-end gaming PC (nVidia 970M, 16GB RAM, plenty of hdd and ssd space, lots of processing power, no other nonessential processes running in the background) and I can barely run this game at medium settings, which are only one step above 'low'. I tried messing with all combinations of video settings, and the game still failed. When I tried googling for documentation to troubleshoot this problem, all I found were a few words about Disciples 2 that stated that one must enable Direct3D in the graphics settings. Sadly, there is no such setting in Disciples 3.  As such, the game is essentially unplayable to anyone with a fairly new computer. I'd strongly advise against purchasing the game.
554	1	a	Loved Orcs Must Die! So much fun and very satisfying setting up your traps for the orcs. Can be quite challenging in parts. Really looking forward now to Orcs Must Die! 2...
3670	1	a	One of the best Total War games. Possibly because its the first to bring in naval warfare to the game and because its no longer a melee battle game. Having rifles brings a different and fresh feel for the game. And it makes you rethink all the strategy you knew before.
891	1	a	Epic first person tower defense fiery crossbow sword wielding flame roasting orc slaying madness. Good Times.
5159	1	a	Fun and addictive a good time sink.
3798	1	a	Best Strategy Game Evar. If you want increased unit sizes you can get darthmod which can give you battles of up to 10000 with the right circumstances and when people said this was buggy as hell CA fixed it at a later patch. This is one of the few games that offer 18th century warfare. Seriosly it must have tooken alot of courage to march in that front line.There is even campaign!!! on my game list it is rated as a 10/10 although they could've released multiplayer campaign now that it is so old
216	1	a	Without a doubt, one of the finest and most engaging games out there.
1891	1	a	Ordered my Prussian hussars to charge a bunch of British Riflemen. Riflemen started running before my hussars hit them. Hussars clashed into Riflemen. Riflemen flying everywhere.  I swore I saw one Rifleman get rammed 40 yards across a field by a hussar's steed, before getting up and then dying.
1846	1	a	Amazing Game one of the best of the Franchise
1211	1	a	This is what III should have been like all along. It's fantastic now and deeply enjoyable. It's a shame it took so long to get it right, I feel many people have left the franchise. It's a great game though. I adore the music, the art, the story, the battle system. The customizable leaders. They added some great stuff in here. However the AI is exceptionally bad. The version hard is essentially giving you opponents 12 levels higher. I'm not sure what goes into making AI's but both the opponents and the general monsters on a map could use a serious intelligence boost, not level boost.
4802	1	a	This is a fantastic game. Great value, hours and hours of entertainment.
3569	1	a	So... I've played quite a lot of this game, as the hours show.  Empire is by no means a perfect game. It got a lot of flak on release and, even with updates and fixes, it still deserves some of that. But if you're interested in the period, and a Total War fan, I recommend giving it a try. I did, and sorta fell in love with it.
4193	1	a	Fantastic graphics, a lot more tactical than simply charging at your enemy. Quick thinking situations and spectacular campaign.
3998	1	a	just murderd 1000 indian miltia's with 240 line infantry 10/10 would butcher again
1086	1	a	Tower defense game mixed with first person shooter. Funny comments in game. Plays really well. Three difficulty levels provide great challenge.  [my ranking: 6.5/10]
281	0	a	While OMD is a very cute game, it suffers from some fairly crippling design flaws. Firstly, most of the levels' difficulty results directly from one decision the devs made; instead of allowing choke-points or open spaces or a single path, the people who made this game decided that each level be bifurcated, but provided portals to allow us to traverse the two. Pick one, devs. Difficulty or ease. As well, barricades are among the most expensive single buildables. In this vein, it is much more economically viable to murder all the monsters yourself, as traps are A) very expensive and B) reset much too slowly. So why, for the love of Atheismo, is there only a 'cash bonus to trap kills' purchaseable!? Why can't we simply rely on weapons? Oh, right-- because the devs decided to split each level in two, so we can't simply use one route or the other. You're forced to use both the (mandatory) crossbow and (shoddy, unreliable) traps. Still, it's a fun romp, even for its faults and flaws.
641	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥
1733	1	a	The 13 colonies will rise again.
1	1	a	Nice polished fun TD/3PS. Got to finish it sometime. High quality game for cheap, what's not to like?
2409	1	a	great game
3969	1	a	Classic.
3997	1	a	Great game for all stratagists 
4661	1	a	Ive put 50 hours into this game. The difficulty spikes make it really hard to get the later tier ships that you absolutely need to stand a chance at progressing. Its a pretty fun game.
1186	1	a	If you like the Disciple Franchise, you will like Disciples III, sort of. I found enough changed to keep it fresh, while still keeping a lot of what made the original two great. 8/10
4125	1	a	If you like Total War and guns. Well here you go.
1243	1	a	The game is a tower defense game. Is it worth $10 maybe not for something you can play on a Browser for free. If you can get this game for $5 or under. I think its worth the game time. Its fun and I enjoy playing this.
1907	1	a	WE NEED MORE PEOPLE PLAY THIS GAME PLEASE THIS IS THE BEST GAME OF 2020!
5246	1	a	This is a good, solid game. Lots of fun, but hard to learn flying controls. Awesome on Alienware. Colours change on keyboard &amp; mouse depending on your situation, is turning red when low health etc.
2860	1	a	great game
4357	1	a	&gt; Start new game as Russia &gt; Invade Poland-Lithuania &gt; Invasion's going well &gt; Prussia invades Poland &gt; Warsaw falls, relations with Prussia are increasing &gt; Out of nowhere Prussia invades me with several armies &gt; After several bad decisions I lose 10/10 would imitate WW2 again
4215	1	a	this was the 2nd Total War game I got and my 2nd favorite
1223	1	a	Great little tower defense game. But there are equal alternatives that you can play for free. If it's on sale you can't do anything wrong buying it.
544	1	a	Play the first one, tons of fun. Do NOT buy the second one, omg snooze-fest almost immediately. Complete and utter sequel fail. So crushingly dissappointed.
2164	1	a	I agree with most of the positive comments. One of the better games of the series.
4084	1	a	10/10 best simulator game of da year m89
3197	1	a	A fantastic RTS game. Controls are easy and the battles are engaging. Requires a moderate to high end PC.
995	1	a	Good game, would recommend!
158	1	a	Crazy fun action tower defense style game, you'l be hooked within one level. Funny and enjoyable.  It's a healthy blend of Shooter with Tower Defense, allowing you to build traps on the walls, ceilings, and floors to create unique kill zones. But also letting you equip spells and weapons to fight off the Orcs that way if you'd like.
4250	1	a	great game, always has a new take, as it randomizes events even one turn replayed. Strategy is constantl evolving as you play, so you can win or lose ground very easily.
2254	1	a	Ah the good old days before CA REALLY started cutting content and â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ wallets. Tech trees, a good list of countries to play and you can be Russia :D  Still a few small bugs but it was all downhill after this....
4730	1	a	addictive game
3026	1	a	TL;DR: If you are a fan of this era in history, then you will enjoy the game. If you are looking for a matchlock style game, try Shogun 2 FOTS. I honestly think Shogun 2 just did it better.  OK. I honestly wanted to give this game a downvote because Shogun 2 FOTS is superior on a technical level. The AI is better, the unit diversity is better. Does this mean Emipre is a bad game? No. But, if you're looking for the Total War game with guns, then I highly recommend Shogun 2 FOTS over Emipre. You can usually find both on sale and shogun 2 is like 7.50 while Empire is 4.50. So for the extra 3 bucks you're getting a much more modern game.  Again - if you are a fan of this time period then give it a try as you will most likely like it. But if you're looking for the TTW game with rifles, I honestly think that Shogun 2 FOTS is a more modern, more refined, and more flushed out game that's going to give you a better experience.  Empire : Great attempt. Shogun 2 FOtS: took what empire did right, made it better, and made a fantastic fantastic game.
305	1	a	This is an immensely fun game that successfully blends frantic action with the need to pay attention to your environment and to plan ahead. It'sgood for hours of fun - pick it up as soon as you can!
4309	1	a	One of my all time favourites games! Its combines the perfect amount of territory managemanet and army/fleet control. 8 years after its release still play this game in a normal basys. Strongly recommend this game to fans of the total war franchise or to someone who just likes stratagy games. Hope you have fun!
2181	1	a	Ok... I know that it got a bit of a slating by the players and the review but come on, if you want a fun game that you can spend ours on and you like strategy games it is great. It offers 3 theaters of war unlike Napoleon total war and the graffics are good, especially if you are running it on a slow comuter or a laptop. The sieges need to be tweeked so the path of your units doesn't run the wrong way. But on the whole it is a good game.
3932	1	a	7/10
1992	1	a	Music sucks and is really buggy, heavily unbalanced AI system and is one of the Best TW games out there
2623	1	a	One of my favorite games ever. I started with Sweden. I decided to take over Denmark. Once i fully took over Denmark's territory, I headed to America. I took over almost all of the Colonys there,but I had to war with France and Spain.After I had full control of my colonies and formed and aliance with Britian.When I started back on my empire in Europe I decided to unite St. Petersburg with my main area,soo I invaded Russia in winter and won. The Russians still control the southern part of their empire and me and the Ottomans are closing in on them.  10/10 would make a Swedish Empire again!
5111	1	a	This game is way too much addictive, play with a clock beside you!
698	1	a	An action oriented tower defence game, where you are right in the midst of the battle, tossing down traps, casting fireballs and building crazy trap combos. Good mechanics, cheerful aesthetics, funny lines... The comboing mechanic is cool, but a bit under used. Especially if you don't care about getting the high score and would rather concentrate on getting a perfect run.
1409	1	a	Started as britain and fought on 8 fronts at the same time and won,had a trade ship get attacked by a full armada of galleons and such clicked auto resolve and won,I was out number 3 to 1 used 4 cannons with shotgun ammo shots killed 3000 people and won.never tell me the odds 4189041432/10
1004	1	a	Very fun tower defense / action mix! Even for people less enthusiastic about the genre. Very satisfying trap effects, simple but good graphics. Trap diversity ir rarely used though. You can use alot, but often a concentration of 2-3 are the best.
2264	0	a	A deeply flawed game on release, it's become playable, but I wouldn't recommend it unless you pick up a mod such as the excellent 'Darth Mod.' Skip to Napoleon or Shogun II.
2194	0	a	Very Positive, you're friggin kidding me.   I remember this when it was released years ago, that this game was VERY buggy at the time, 7 years later and some game-breaking bugs still EXIST.  One of this, is the notorius save game corrupt bug that i just experienced. When you get far in the game, 50 turns+, there is a danger that the your save games WILL GET CORRUPTED. This happens without warning, if you seat down for long sessions, and just save save save and save, and overwrite previous saves, and don't load back, there is a great danger that you will lose a lot of progress.   You will only notice then in your next session, that you can't load anymore anymore any of your save games. They will just cause the game to crash to the desktop.  What happens when the game starts corrupting the save games, all saves you do after that point will also get corrupted, so there is a chance you wont know it, and you will need to go a long way back.  I read the in forums of several people experiencing this, and its pretty common, and some can't finish the game, because they get stuck in a neverending corrupt-reload-go back loop.  So please let this be a warning, so if you are going to play, backup regularly, or dont' overwrite your save games. 
4316	1	a	Love this game. Over 300 hours writing this. One thing i nrecommend, save before a nation is destroyed as the nations that become liberated for the fact its destroyed may crash the game so i recommend save, if it happens then dont destroy them or take their colonies. Maybe destroy later instead. One thing as well, if its the AI destroying the nation then try and stop them by helping the nation out, minor nations have no effect apart from, what i found, the pirates if they return or the United States
4173	1	a	Okay skids its story time.  -Year is like... 1730 32... I don't remeber point is as prussia I just stamped out the remaining Netherland and austrian rebels. - I am happy. - I make Prussia into the most devloped nation with metalled roads and advanced farm's entertainment militarty ect. - I set my eyes on saxtony (My ally that i spared from my crusade on germany and the sorrounding territories)  - The turn I decide to declare war Sweeden declares war on me. - I laugh. - Sweeden sends around 300-500 Soldiers to invade brendenburg  - I send 1.7K Soldiers and I â¥â¥â¥ rape them (While Seig Heil Viktoria is playing in the backround) - I take their occupied city in denmark.  - Russia takes their city in finland 1 turn before my forces arrive their - I ally russia - I set my eyes back on saxtony. I take their capital in 1 turn wiping out their entire army. - Poland gets pissy  - I offer them a bunch of â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ tech to get peace back (Mainly because I didn't have alot of men on my eastern front) They agree - Poland requests a military alliance the next turn. - I notice the marthra confederacy is in the european theatre (Mainly the middle east) - I send spies to spy on the ottoman empire. - They have a embrassingly low military presence period. - I plan to steam roll the ottomans but that is a story for when it actually happens...
1553	1	a	Really love the game, personally would love an update to do co-op campaign that would be my only complaint everything else seems manageable.
725	1	a	Orcs, Orcs, Orcs and did I mention there are orcs ? This game is all about orcs! You are the last defender of the magic in your world, but you are kinda stupid and not very good at your job! So jump right into the action and kill orcs, orcs and orcs (sometimes a few oger)
4256	1	a	At launch this game was a mess. Today, after numerous patches, it's an enjoyable romp through the early modern era but lacks some of the punch of others in the series.   Some pointers: -Battle AI is much weaker than Rome I or Shogun 2 but the breadth of the campaign map is some compensation.  -This game introduced naval battles to TW but they are more fun in Shogun 2 -Settlement construction is streamlined for better or worse -Economic buildings require more micro
4416	1	a	its cool brah
4567	1	a	Great name good space combat narrator totalhalibut youtube beats lots of ships cheap value for money
558	1	a	Totally addictive, very easy to start, but after a while it starts to test your skills. It's a very fun game to play, really worth the price  100 out of 100 of course ;)
588	1	a	Orcs Must Die! is an extremely fun Tower Defense game, with a very nice mix of tower (trap) defense and third person action game.  While there are clearly some traps which are much more useful than others and you will tend to gravitate towards them, there is still a large amount to choose from, so you can easily set up some deadly combinations to defeat the invading orcs.  The gameplay is where the game really shines, while the level design is so-so, the sheer amount of variety in the game compensates for that.  The only major fault of the game is that it appears personal abilities are very strong and can overshadow the traps themselves, so if you are strategy minded you might be disappointed since, especially in the early waves, you will have to rely heavily on your character to do most of the work.  Great game let down by balance issues and level design.  8 / 10
4318	1	a	By a mile my favourite Total War Game, virtually no glitches or any issues of that kind after years of being played by people.   Nothing hugely complicated or overwhelming about it but can be difficult on the higher settings. Just a shame it doesnt have a multiplayer but its an old game so nevermind.   I would 100% advise to anyone who enjoys strategy games.
4939	1	a	if you know me you know i play games constantly until i beat them this game is Great, if you played the demo and liked it, i reccommend you buy it 205 hours of game time, and i've beaten it twice
4868	1	a	This game is easily one of my favorite Steam discoveries. Imagine a two-dimensional Freelancer and you're pretty close.
3645	1	a	This is a brilliant game I must say. The only other game in the TW series I have played previously to this one was Medieval II of which I found very much enjoyable, however 'Empire: Total War' is moderately different but, in my opinion significantly more enjoyable. The campaign features the entire world (excluding the Northern and Southern Ice caps) as oppose to Medieval II which only featured Europe.  This game in the Total War series also featured not only land based conflict, but also sea based conflict of which the player has the ability to command and control.  Ultimately I found this game extremely enjoyable and would recommend this game to anyone, particularly those whom enjoy games within the strategy genre, but even those who don't may even be persuaded to do so by this brilliant game!
1119	1	a	An utterly fun game, Orcs Must Die! combines FPS with placing down traps. Probably not a new idea, but that doesn't in any way, shape, or form detract from the enjoyability, so let's get into some pros and cons.  Pros -It has some story elements (a big thing with me). This game could have gone without story altogether and still been fun, but the developers decided to spice it up! I mean, sure it's a pretty basic story, but, considering the game genre, I'll consider it a pro. -Responsive and intuitive controls that are easy to learn and get the hang of. -Normal (Warmage) difficulty getting boring? Try Nightmare difficulty for the challenge you crave. -Great music and graphics. -Great replayability across most levels (I say most because the first level, even on Nightmare, will get easy pretty quick). -Funny commentary from the characters. -DLC adds new weapons, traps, and levels.  Cons -No multiplayer. If you're not into that then this point is moot. -Only one character and set of weapons/traps. -DLC costs money. Might be a con to some. I wasn't personally bothered by it, but, then again, I probably got it on sale 'cause I'm cheap like that.  So, yeah, that's all I got. So go get it. It's worth its full price, but if you want to get it on sale, that's understandable. Anyways, it's a great game I would recommend to just about everyone.
3396	1	a	Have an army of Swedes performing God's deeds.
4205	1	a	Very nice game if you like the colonisation era. Very realistic and epic, the battles are immersive. The campaings can take countless hours to finish, and you feel proud after. The only downside is that I didn't play this game sooner!
3461	1	a	Id say this game is great. Its my favourite of all the Total War genre. The fact that the economy is so much easier to handle is a great help, manage 50 territories in a minute for tax. Also that hated delay after building something then having to wait soooo long or a large enough population to progress to the next level no longer exits. The research tree is fun as each play through you can decide what you need to research, so as you play as different factions you can customize what bonuses, buildings and units you unlock first to get the edge to win the game.
224	1	a	Orcs. They must die. DIE! DIE! DIE! DIE! DIE! DIE! DIE!!
735	1	a	Fun and simple, with lots of jokes, this game is a MUST buy, this and the sequel!
4864	1	a	great job to the developers. if you like a little bit of action, a little bit of harvesting, space travel, upgrading ships and weapons systems, trading with random encounters in space, and a well thought-out game with nice visuals, this is for you. the price is very fair for what you get and i would recommend it to anybody wanting some casual and progressive space fun. havent gotten to the zombies yet though :) definitely recommended
2499	1	a	This is a good game, but after playing it extensivley, I observed some gaps that need to be filled in. I know the game was released in 2009, but there is no reason CA can't revisit this game and make some updates to the AI to improve the game overall. It shouldn't be too difficult, and will result in increased customer satisfaction and loyalty.  Some ideas to consider: Ditch the thirteen colonies, and make each colony a separate faction; Add attrition to naval units(i.e. a ship can't sit out in the ocean for years without starvation, mutiny, ship bottom falling out. etc); Enable characters to transition from gentlman to general to minister. Add more officer ranks so characters can rise from Leiutenant, captain, major, colonel, to general; Have a pool of characters to chose from different tiers of society(i.e. royalty, aristocracy, gentry, yeomanry, and so forth); Enable amphibious battles involving ships and land units; All characters of the aristocracy can duel; Add East India company as faction; Include buildings such as East India House, Bank of England(Throw Central Banks into the mix); Ships should be able to enter neutral and allied ports for repairs(at greater cost); When an army occupies a foreign town or port, you should be able to repair town and use its resources; You may not attack another monarchy's home capital unless one of your characters has a legitamate claim to that throne; If AI has character in another faction with claim to your throne, than it will spawn an army around that character to invade. You can chose to side with that army or fight it. If you take another Euro monarchy's home capital, you don't get that region, the character you used simply becomes the new king of that faction and you lose control of that character. The benefit is alliance and trade.  These are just a few ideas I'm throwing out there for CA or modders.
3199	1	a	zwhat a great game. It such a time sink but fun. the map is soo large and it contains soo much faction, if you pair it with DarthMOd it is delicously entertaining.
2117	1	a	Took over the whole of the Netherlands and Great Britian in only 10 years with France.   10/10 would detroy two nations again!
2349	1	a	This game is my all time favorite, I would recommend this game to anyone who loves history or strategy games, such as myself.
3847	1	a	a fine example of what a stratagy game should persist of
1885	1	a	i play gaem wit friend and it es a good gaem me friend and other friend play gaems togetheer and he say gem is gud so i by an play and i say et es gud to you should geett dis gaem.
597	1	a	this is worth it. its tower defence but fun like irongrip warlords. unfortunately not multiplay. :_(
393	1	a	Orcs Must Die: a Haiku  I shoot the orc dead.  I burn, crush, smash, throw, and stab.  I know: Orcs must die!     10/10 Would load up to shoot orcs again....stupid orcs.
2211	1	a	10/10 would play again
1320	1	a	The United Provinces is flourishing. They have now conquered Morocco, and have deimated the Nation of France. All of the Island territories belonging to the French and Pirates are now under their control.  The Nordic nations have now bent the knee, with Denmark being forced to retreat to Iceland, remaining as Protectorate.  The Indian theater of war has seen bloody battles for the United Provinces. The people of Meysore have fallen, and the Marathan Confederacy are decimated. The Mughal Empire is weary, and demands a peace, to which I must agree.   Then, as nobody had expected, THE SPANISH INQUISITION. Like a swift manouver, suddenly the province of France is obtained. Morocco falls, and then the American territories fall. One by one, the Spanish Inquisition takes the United Provinces by storm. Soon, Russia invaded me in the winter. The Scandanavian countries fall, the Prussians get in on the action, and take Copenhagen.  Watching from my Palace, I see the Empire crumble. Soon the valiant men of Amsterdam must defend against the coalition. Russians, Prussians and Spanish have all joined to defeat this once proud nation. The brave men of Amsterdam try, but fail. I have been defeated. I then proceed to walk away from my computer, stand in my shower, and cry in the cold, icy water.
4831	1	a	A great game, I enjoyed it a lot. Custom ship building, spaceship battles, different missions, some decision to make, enjoyable story. It might be a good idea to read through some tips on online wikis, so that you don't miss something important (the game doesn't always explain everything properly).
623	1	a	Great mindless fun for the whole family. But really, buy this game!
4826	1	a	closest thing to star control since star control
4765	1	a	Space Rangers 3!
5164	1	a	Fight, Collect, Upgrade, Explore. It takes a few basic videogame elements and combines them into a enjoyable whole. The best space ship game I have played in a long while.
353	1	a	Better than tower wars!
3288	1	a	Don't Save your money, THIS GAME ROCKS!
1694	1	a	This game has given me many hours of entertainment! Fantastic mods, beautfiful maps.
2771	1	a	The is my favorite total war game, MY CHOICE NOT YOURS.    My favorite is playing as the Dutch and conquering India and the Americas!
1227	0	a	I don't even know when I got this game.
812	1	a	This is a really clever and fun TPS tower defense strategy game. The dungeon atmosphere really makes it stand out from the growing crowd. Lots of weapon and trap unlocks give the right incentive to want to push further in the campaign missions. It does get quite difficult as a single player game because the monsters often attack from opposite sides of the map and it's hard to be fighting two places at once--they do provide portals to shorten the journey but they always seem to be poorly positioned (would have been nicer if you got to place the portals yourself). There is also a high dependence on your shooter skills because the trap reload times take forever in the heat of battle, although it is possible I haven't figured out the right mix. So far, I've only seen upgrades for traps, not weapons which is a bummer.    No coop is the game's major weakness, but it is enjoyable despite.
2727	1	a	Love the game something fierce. I defeated the Russian campaign on easy then I took the rest of the world for achievements. I had a blast with the game and highly recommend it. However I did have issues conquering the entire world however in a game pic I proved that it is possible. The game at several points wouldn't give me an end turn button and game crashed a few times as well... It took some doing. However for the most part it was mostly due to my empire being so freakishly large. The game works awesomely other wise. Takes some effort getting use to it. Also a word of advice playing the battles out can be a world of difference in most cases. Some if it says your going to win just auto it otherwise you could lose. However fight most of them out... Trust me. Very good game though. I highly recommend however you don't have to take my word for it... :D
4820	1	a	Completely insane story, however with addictive, simple gameplay. Try it out when you can for cheap!
2747	1	a	Pros: I can take over France  Cons: The French won
1839	1	a	This Game is always really fun!!
168	1	a	I definatley recommand this game and I hope u have extra cash cause your going to want part 2 after playing this!
601	1	a	Christmas and New Year 2011 was written off because of this game. It was well worth it too!
4839	1	a	Dumb amounts of fun.
3611	1	a	Empire: Total war is epic. Easy interface and addicting gameplay, this game does the Total War series proud. Sometimes the troops will be a little wacky but not very often. By wacky I mean, they'll go in some weird direction when you order them to attack sometimes but that's all I've ever came across. Great Game!
4476	1	a	I have owned the Collectors Edition of AoE III since it was released in November 2005. It is my most played game by far, probably above 3,000 hours. One thing I can say with complete certainty is, if you get into the online multiplayer, like really get into it. You will always come back to this game and enjoy every moment.   If you're a new player, and are willing to get into this game :    go ahead and message me, i'll try to help you out!  
1640	1	a	Its killing me now Best strategy game ever Highly recommend  I have been an RTS fan since early on, played all the great names from Command &amp; Conquer to Wh40k: Dawn of War. Of all these games, Empire:TW brought the biggest satisfaction. The game might be getting old now, but it`s glory doesn't fade. Even if you never played Total War games before, this is a must buy for any RTS fan. Starting from the graphics. Like said, some time passed since it`s release, but never the less, when put on max. settings it is still beautiful. The sound is done quite well. I enjoy every round of shots made from the infantery, the roar of canons, the thousands of feet marching to the beat of the drum, the hissing of primitive missiles in the air..... The game itself gives you a lot of feautres. The two singleplayer modes let you play as some of the greatest nations of the time, from Prussia to the Maratha Confederacy (the other SP mode let`s you play as the United States on their way to independence). Your job is to form alliances, make trade, conquer areas, defeat your enemies, develop your nation, and if you feel like it, you can always coup the monarchy and establish a republic. The campaign itself is turn based, moving your armies and agents in a pre-set range of movement each season, governing your cities and doing some diplomacy along the way. The battles on the other hand are real-time, but you can change the speed of battle from slow-motion all the way to fast. The map on which you play on is determined by the region you are fighting in. Battles can be either the classical land battles, sieges or naval battles. If you don't feel like doing a battle, but you have good chances, simply click autoresolve (save the battle just in case you get defeated). The multiplayer is also quite good, letting several players play as their favourite nation and setting up their army. You can join your friends and fight bots, do 1v1, or a large scale battle of up to 6 players 3v3.
5067	1	a	This game is a rare indy gem, unlike most indie gems, this game has more gameplay in it than most games released these days. The story is laughable and hard to follow, something about upgrading your mothership and getting a laser or something, but it does take a pretty unexpected twist in the fourth act.   The meat of the game is VERY customizable ship combat. Outfit your increasingly powerful ships with lasers, cannons, missles, fighter drones, and more. The combat is great too, the Shield/Hull defences vs. Lasers/Projectiles mechanic requires carefull weapon loadouts, and as long as you keep your less than stellar AI comrades under a good leash, even overwhelming odds can be handled with skill.   Also, SPAZ is made by a two-man team who are just doing what they love, and buying this game helps them make the game better. SPAZ has added HUGE amounts of content since launch (Namely the Bounty Hunters) and will keep having content added if people keep supporting it.
3441	1	a	One of the Best RTS games out there and is extremely fun to play through the campaign, Darth Mod is also a must for it!
2035	1	a	The Revolution Sweet!
2851	1	a	This game is 6 years old and I just keep coming back to it. Great replayability and one of only a couple that have lasted this long in my library. I wish there were more like it!
3339	1	a	Gives you the feeling you get when the battle of Helm's Deep is about to begin. I hope more people get the oppurtunity to enjoy this masterpiece.
466	1	a	If you're a tower defence/wave defence fan and enjoy ridiculous humour then I couldn't recommend this more. Sequel coming out soon - worth grabbing this before it does!
4751	1	a	I traded a GayMod steam gift for this game and let me tell you that it was well worth it.  This game is sort of like an online game i've played for like 7 years: Darkorbit except that spaz is a singleplayer game unlike darkorbit, in darkorbit you are overwhelmed by cheaters left and right.   What i like about the game:  - Really RPG like, i LOVE RPG's - You have to plan out a strategy before you go guns ablazin or else you'll end up mining for rez for the next half hour to repair you're fleet - Doesn't take me 5 hours to beat the game, i can see myself sinking 20+ hours into this game   What i don't like about the game:  - Low amount and repetitive missions - Not much to do except whoop some â¥â¥â¥ and mine rez - The solar system is BIG but not big enough, WE NEED BIGGER!!!!! - Small amount of ship classes you can choose from - Small amount of weapons you can choose from   Other thoughts:  It'll be REALLY cool if you could upgrade you're weapons for example, having a level 1 mining lazer and paying to get it to level 2 so it might be 1% faster or have a longer burst. Over all this is a REALLY fun game, highly recommend it.
261	0	a	ERROR:Failed to load 'shaders\FixedFunctionShaders.ShaderLib' Engine will not run.
570	1	a	A fun, cartoony, tower defense/FPS hybrid game. The controls are fluid and easy to pick up. There's a satisfaction that doesn't come with normal tower defense games where you just sit back and watch. If you liked Sanctum, this is better.
3409	0	a	Highly predictable AI in combat. Diplomacy can be immensely frustrating because no nation will agree to do anything. Naval battles are difficult and AI seems to kick the crap out of me every time I don't auto play a battle. Cosmetically uninspiring. Unit variety is lacking in many ways (stats, appearance, abilities) and watching any of the combats up close can be immensely depressing.  Fun, but only occasionally.
4336	1	a	one of the best
2669	1	a	One of the best strategy games out there.
1252	1	a	70/100  Good military TD with Support buildings and a 1-time REPLAY button for the round ;D Long Missions and good Campaign (WorldWar2), but 1 mistake can cost you half the game ;)  Worth the money, but needs some finetuning to become a classic!
4168	1	a	Awesome total war game, up there on my list of favorites. Very unique. Spent the whole game building just a grossly massive superpower out of GB.  battle strategy is quite a bit different than most other TW games due to the new weaponry.   One thing I learned early on though is not to â¥â¥â¥â¥ with the iroquis indians because they will end you.   
722	1	a	What do you get when you combine tower defense and action? Here it is - Orcs Must Die! An innovative twist to tower denfence genre is what you can look forward here. The use of a variety of traps and your action skills are a must to survive each wave of orcs. It's comical to watch how the orcs suffer from your well placed traps, flying through the air and meeting to their ultimate end with a lovely Ode to Joy BGM as the icing (BGM imagined in your head). And you can unlock gifts in Orcs Must Die 2 if you have Orcs Must Die. Surely a must have for those who love tower defence with a sadistic sense of humor. =)
4024	1	a	Worth its price especially if you put darthmod!
1779	1	a	This is the Shiznit!
1006	1	a	Great game that offers a lot of fun for a price you wouldn't expect it!  ... and killing Orcs never gets boring!
3206	1	a	Game is fun, just it's rare to have random problems in the middle of a game and exits the game.
683	1	a	LOTS AND LOTS OF FUN... always love td games, this is a great lighthearted one with lots of very funny one liners like.. well wait and see and you will be 'Winning!'  Seriously worth a tenner considering that would last u 20 mins in a pub. Had over 20 hrs play time on it and not nrly finished everything yet.. then i suck anyway lol!
2220	0	a	Good potential to be the greatest strategy game of the decade but it's not that good. The game keeps crashing, white screens, savegames don't work (it's awful when the game crashes after the end of the turn and you have to go back 10 turns because autosave doesn't work).  it's a shame because the game has many factions that you can play and big maps but it's not more than a beta version. it's more complex than Napoleon total war, but Napoleon total war was well made.   if you must pay more than 5 â¬/$ for it, i don't recomend it.
3335	0	a	I bought this game and it keeps glitching and making it to where i can not even play the game.
579	1	a	Does a really good job of combining Tower Defense with third person FPS elements. Difficulty curve goes way up halfway through, but it's worth seeing through to the end. Definately recommend for Tower Defense fans.
2047	1	a	good game but alot of errors freezes and takes ages to load
4848	1	a	An updated Star Control for today's gamer. Well worth the money!
1805	1	a	Best total war game, best depth and content. Makes subsiquent games look simplistic and limited.  The closest thing to it is the EU games, and even those dont have the same level of depth immersion as Empire does.  If you havent played it and like total war games, make sure you give it a try.
2001	1	a	Best Game ever thets reunite the great English Empire once more! 
5168	1	a	Top down space shooter with an addictive progression system. It feels like a 2D Freelancer flying around upgrading ships, blowing up pirates, civilians, zombies, police cruisers all the while upgrading your little band of mercenary ships makes for an absolutely fantastic time.   The open ended nature of the game gives the player freedom to go where they like while the narrative gives a general direction on where to go next. Combat is fluid and each ship handles a little differently as a space game should. All this made by two people. Weapon and ship upgrades keep the player going for 'just a bit longer' into the wee hours of next week.  Get it, play it, love it. 
1776	1	a	this is a great game while others are graphiclly supirior it is a great game and definatly worth the buy you can fight naitives in the americas slaughter europe wreck the middle east conqer north africa and bomb india lots of gameplay and an ok amount of factions 9/10
364	1	a	You may think this game looks boring and is pretty one sided but the moment I saw the trailer this definately looked fun. And then I won the game and later bought the DLC on a sale.  This game is hilarious. I'm loving it. You pretty much have to fight against waves and waves of orcs but you get all these brilliant contraptions such as flip tiles, wall arrows, your own archers, floor spikes, explosive barrels so you can build up your defences and hold off against the enemy waves. It gets really challenging when you have a few entry points but if you think well and have a good defence structure, it's a breeze. Endless action, a very funny protagonist and visuals that make you feel like your in a cartoon, it's awesome. 9/10!
4163	1	a	i dont know what it is about this total war game. but it's the best they made if you'll ask me.
4898	1	a	The only bad thing about this game is the fact that I discovered it so late. It's brilliant and well worth buying. Can't wait for SPAZ 2 to be released
3304	1	a	Fantastic game series, I recommend buying them all. Literally every single one down to Shogun.
3780	1	a	-=TOTAL WAR=- - Wanna have a game that you can play like one year? TOTAL WAR - Wanna see fighting and blood and have all countrys in the world? TOTAL WAR - Wanna play with your home country? TOTAL WAR
3552	1	a	Empire: Total Warâ¢ is a milestone for the Total War series. With great units, a detailed campaign for the great American Revolution, and diplomatic relations that make sense.  This installment in the Total War series is arguably one of the best, next to Napoleon: Total War. It features many different game modes, which are: Campaign, Road to Independence, and Battles (as well as Multiplayer, but only battles may be accessed through this). Campaign is treated like a Civilization game. You pick a nation, and must conquer a certain amount of territories, plus a few required named territories (EX: Britain must capture New France, Georgia, Leeward Islands, Ireland, Gibraltar, Florida, Hindustan, Scotland, and England alone with 25 regions by the end of the year 1750 in a short campaign). In the campaign, you may build numerous buildings such gardens, barracks, markets, fur traders, brothels, etc. You can also build units, and lead them into battle. The battle system in campaign has 3 options. Siege, Assault, and Auto-Resolve (along with retreating). When sieging a city, it will 'starve' a city to where you can take the city over without fighting after a number of turns, depending on it's defenses. The enemy can fend off a siege, though. The assault option takes a more advanced turn on battles, to where you may command your units to fight the enemy units, and manage the battle manually. The auto-resolve option is just what it says, it automatically decides who the winner of the battle will be depending on numbers, technology, and skills of both of the empires. This option is what I usually choose, unless the odds do not look in my favor or the skills look even. In campaign, diplomatic relations also take place. Depending on which nation you are, you may start out with some allies depending on the history of your nation (EX: Spain is with Britain, Great Britain is with United Provinces). Other nations become wary of being your allies if you go to war with your own allies, or break treaties. The longer you have someone as your friend, the harsher the trust falls with other nations. Economy also exists within Empire, and gaining money can be fairly challenging. You may become trading partners with other nations (the best route, just don't declare war on everyone!), you may tax your people highly (not recommended, as the people will revolt to make new nations), and you can always take over other regions (though you will have to exempt them from tax for a few turns to lower the chances of rebellions and strikes).  In the Road to Independence, you are the Thirteen Colonies. You first start by fighting Native Americans, you settle. The campaign then focuses on settling the lands, and defending them from Native Americans. Later on, you have to capture regions from the French in the French and Indian War. This then leads to pushing the actual British out of the lands, claiming Independence. A fairly fun campaign.  In Battles mode, this focuses on battles and battles only (aka 'Assaulting' a city in campaign). You can either customize your own battles, or choose from the historical ones already laid out for you.  Multiplayer for this game features Battles mode, and no campaign. It is fairly fun, but be sure to warm up in campaign first before trying to conquer your friends!  --- ***BUGS***  This game is known for having some AI problems and not a lot of difficulty. This can be fixed by DarthMod, but I never saw the need to use it. Thanks for reading my review!
4488	1	a	Nice story with awesome, simplified UI of complex mechanics and ship customization !  Can be stupidly hard on hardest difficulties if you're into that :P
2728	1	a	Possible the best game i've ever played. Its dosen't have any gore. Its better than napoloen total war. The only thing that would make it better, would be if there where more reason to start wars in the first place, like you could make laws for crimes you people do in your kingdom and empire. something to have more reason to take over other places. .You should also be able to ask your allies to move troops to another area. But its still a amazing game where you take over other areas just like the real rulers in the 1700s used to do. I also like how you convert other reglions into your reglion witch gives you a reason the take over other areas. It is a amazing game and a love it and still give it 10 out of 10.
842	1	a	Dead Orc = Good Orc
3829	1	a	Great American Independence Campaign. Lots of bugs which have been ironed out but not eliminated. Nations tend to be mere color swaps of each other &amp; this get's tired quickly. Recommend Napoleon TW a whole lot more. Seriously lacking when it comes to the other big 18th Century event, the French Revolution.
2150	1	a	You can replay scenes from Patriot. 18/18
3695	1	a	Excellent introduction to gunfire in the Total War series! Yes, the AI can be wierd some times, but not as wierd as the newer Rome 2....
3864	1	a	Captured the whole world with America deleted my whole army and navy raised taxes level to max gain 10468 gold each turn 3 turns lost 75% of my land 10/10
1624	1	a	best game ever if you sre looking for a stragity game thisi is the one and hope they make a empire total war 2 
3710	1	a	I think this game is awesome. there is nothing else to be said.
4116	0	a	I do not recommed this as it is about buyable content ! 
3857	1	a	I love this game, with the correct mod installed it is awesome. But it is still great by itself.The grand campaign can last you for up to a month just to finish.
4561	1	a	Fun concept and style but it gets sort of repetitive after awhile. Spacecraft dogfights are awesome!
5291	1	a	Every time I come back to this, I enjoy it a little more. Not much I can say to describe why I like it, except that it scratches that itch for space combat and ship customization. Mods are pretty tight too.
4032	1	a	Ships still get stuck, and AI is still stupid (though Warpath Campaign challenges me due to initial setting).  However, this is fun, well-polished game which runs on Linux perfectly.  Graphics is gorgeous, replayability is very high, what's not to like.
368	1	a	One of the most addictive Tower Defense games out there! Packed with action, with a variety of traps, spells and weapons to dispose of the Orcish hordes. The game leaves it's tools in our hands and the result is immensely rewarding!
768	1	a	excellent tower defence game.
3973	1	a	Hey play this game. Conquer the world. And defeat the Mighty British.
1807	1	a	Fun game with great mods
1705	0	a	Tried to go back to this game and it's a bit buggy and does not explain information in a clean way. The Overworld UI is terrible as well making you go hunting for small buildings that are not mapped.
2516	1	a	Any fan of the Total War series should play Empire: Total War. The game takes a whole new approach to the Total War gameplay. Naval Battles are one of the better additions.
3801	1	a	Great game. Buy it you worthless â¥â¥â¥â¥.
839	1	a	Orcs Must Die is pure fun. I've sunk over 40 hrs into this game and loved every minute of it. I really hope they make a sequel.
1840	1	a	Empire Total War is far the best out of the series in my opinion. I mean not the vanilla,but with the DarthMod you can reach every undeveloped part of the game which is very nice itself,but overall this,you will have a free expansion for the game.By this i mean you will be able to play with the minor factions which are in the vanilla game but you can't acces to it.How cool is to conquer the whole game world with buccaneers? Cool,isn't it?..So if i didn't conviced you yet watch videos of the game you're going to be ....This is my best game EVER! (If you'd like to play online battles with me feel free to send a friend request) 
4382	1	a	Very fun game. One of the best strategy games out there. Naval and land wars which make it cooler.
227	1	a	With a title like that how is one supposed to refuse? Ok it's actually rather fun. For the seasoned tower defense expert it's a rather fun 3D variation. Tower Defense for the uninitiated is at it's best a grid based puzzler. Choose how and where to defend utilising resources you earn. The more experianced you become, the more traps and defenses you can place. It's biggest failing is that there is no autofire. Constantly having to slam the mouse button to fire an arrow or whack a sword becomes a little tiring. Would I reccommend it? Yes I would on a steam sale, simply for the fun sounds and indie humour, dotted around endearing orcy goodness. A quick level now and again, is what makes a solid indie hit. Without the 'just one more go' deliciousnous of games like this, we'd forget the simple pleasure of gaming.
3121	1	a	Great all round total war game easy contolls good graphics
3555	1	a	Best game ever. So many regions to conquer, so many factions to pick from (Empire total Factions is a must)... and really detailed! This game will never get old! It's by far one of my favorites!
1711	1	a	Empire total war is like a sickly child (no offence to anyone who might have one). Of course, it's your baby and you love it, but it's just not... there, you know? Empire, even to this day, lacks polish (not the country, dangit) and there are still some absolutely ridiculous undertakings by the AI, most of which we'll get to later. But how about the pros and cons of the Vanilla game, shall we?   PROS -excellent representation of 18th century warfare -the emergence of nations, such as Greece, USA and Scotland (among others) is interesting and mixes the campaign up -you may now contest in 3 theatres: America, India and Europe -The campaign map is pretty, has lots of cool features such as towns that magically spring out of the ground, and a realistic intercept feature, meaning you can't just trot by an enemy army without implications -Graphics are still ok, despite it's age -Naval battles are a very welcome introduction, and they're pulled of qute well. -Interesting tech tree -Fantastic new trading system on the campaign map  CONS -Battle AI can be gamebreaking -AI diplomacy is all over the place -Melee combat is an absolute snoozefest, and infantry charging is all sorts of broken, glitchy and weird -18th century warfare means little in unique units within the same culture. All european armies will end up looking the same, just as all native american armies are just as similar -With so much emphasis on the navy and trade, naval battles can become very frequent and very repetitive, especially in local trade theatres and against pirates -Autoresolving is broken. You can have a 1500 army come up against 80 rebel swordmen and lose 300 men. How?  If you do get this game, i highly recommend DarthMod. I'm not gonna bother with the links etc. but it's definately worth a look see. The battles in Empire are underwhelming, especially with the poor AI, decision making and lack of bloodthirsty action, but DarthMod does a great job at reparing a few glaring problems as well as adding new features not only to battles, but the campaign as well.   The broken AI means i give this game an overall 6/10. The campaign map is the best it's ever been, but in battle, it's lackluster.  With DarthMod however, this bumbs it up to 8/10 level. Makes battles and campaign far more engaging.
2269	0	a	If you want to fight a turn-based stratergy game in the 1700-1800 then play Napoleon Total War instead
293	1	a	I played this game through in fifteen hours. That's a bit short, but every hour was good fun. Definitely one of the most fun tower defense games I've tried.
4355	1	a	I love this game
5027	1	a	Amazing game. I've put 45 hours into it and i'm not sure if i'm even halfway through!
2263	1	a	Empire: Total War
743	1	a	Wicked fun, Time waster Helps relieve the stress of TMH!!!
2221	0	a	I hate to say but most likely the worst Total War. Most epic scale but poorly optimized from my experiance.
1057	1	a	This is without a doubt the best tower defense game I've played. Lots of fun, and the one liners add a lot of humour.
3067	1	a	My favorite of the series.
4835	1	a	An extremely addictive top-down space shooter combined with a lot of strategical elements that will last for dozens of hours. Excellent value for money and a great indie title :)
738	1	a	They must all die.
2009	1	a	Invade america and shoot many indians. 10/10
1498	1	a	great game good campane and good mutialayer. fun to play with friends and online this is one of the best games on steam and it is one of my favorits. the battles are cool this is how you tell if you are a good leader and i am a good leader and so can you.
1724	1	a	Game Rocks.
3523	1	a	Play this game with DarthMod modification for total fun.  Copy and paste -  http://www.moddb.com/mods/darthmod-empire 
1451	1	a	For days upon days I have played this game, not going outside and having a social life.... Days well spent!
3660	1	a	The best historic war game in History
124	1	a	Orcs Must Die is an incredible new take on tower defense and full of action packed strategy!   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTYqMiAfe7w 
1499	1	a	Some people call this the worst total war game, HOW. Seriously it is the best total war that I have played other than rome 1, Napoleon was laggy, slow, and the animations were funky, Shogun was boring but this game was fun. It was not fun, it was EPIC, Reccomeded
1356	1	a	Empire Total War is the continuation of the Total War franchise bringing it into the Napoleonic era of muskets and cannonballs and while Empire manages to maintain many of the good qualities from the series it brings very little new to the table and the ghosts of old flaws that's brought along makes it a very mixed experience.  Rome Total War have become the benchmark by which the new Total War games are made. Almost every feature and design direction taken in Medieval 2 and Empire comes directly from Rome with no alterations or improvements made and while Rome was a great and innovative game the qualities that made it so are no longer unique to the Total War series and Empire suffers because of it.  If you have somehow never played a Total War game before it can be explained fairly easily. You take command of a nation on a turn-based grand strategy map where you build up your cities and recruit armies. Eventually your enemies will meet up with the armies of other nations and you are thrown from the big strategic map into a real-time 3D tactical battle map where you have direct control of the units of your army as you try to defeat the enemy army.  The strategic map has perhaps always been recognized as the greatest weak point in the Total War games and Empire continues this tradition. The turn-based model was never made with the same care as the turn-based games of old and this shows when a small army can walk past an army ten times it's size, conquering cities and raiding the countryside with impunity and still get far enough away that the larger army won't be able to catch up with it creating a sort of cat and mouse gameplay that does your enjoyment of the game no favors.  Some improvements have been made over the previous games, most notably the introduction of a tech tree that, while still based on buildings in your various provinces, gives you a more open approach to customizing your nation. The diplomacy is as broken as ever and the AI still seems completely incapable of even the simplest tasks. The AI on the campaign map is so bad that if it wasn't for the ludicrous amount of cheating it does on the higher difficulties you would be winning every campaign in ten turns or less.  The meat of the game and where Total War made it's name however is the battle map. Gone are the flaws of the campaign map and all that is left is glorious battle with thousands of soldiers at your command.  The problem here however is one that has plagued the Total War series since it's beginning but is even more apparent now that it's made the jump into Napoleonic line combat. The AI is useless. It's not just that the AI is bad, it's that it cannot perform even the simplest of tasks which makes battles against it so trivial that it's almost painful at times. You would think that the developers would have discovered a way for the AI to maintain a formation beyond the first shot fired but every time it happens, the AI falls completely apart.  The simplicity and limits of the game engine is also beginning to show as even though your soldiers are armed with musket and bayonet instead of sword and arrow now the battles still play out in much the same way as in previous games. This might be fine for a Rome or a Medieval 2 but Empire tries to emulate a very different age of war and it does not quite meet the standard of that era. Particularly if you've played the Take Command series of games you will begin to notice just how simple the tactical elements of the game have become.  The battles are beautiful and your soldiers look impressive as they march forward in formation and the sounds are top quality.  If someone who had never played a Total War game before asked me for a recommendation I'd tell him to get the newest one. Empire Total War might be a better game than Rome Total War but that is only a question of age. The Total War series used to be innovative, now they're just shallow repeats with little to look forward to.
805	1	a	Just another tower defense? Think again. This game is great, spamable crossbow, hack-and-slash, quick magic spells, orcs torn to pieces, sliced orcs, impailed orcs, burnt orcs, electrocuted orcs, orcs swimming in acid and lava pits, flying orcs, orcs flying into one another because of your catapults. This game is awesome and you can be too if you buy it. The only downside: it's with orcs.
2399	1	a	Amazing! Like playing a Complex version of Risk
4015	1	a	Very good battle gameplay. Several bugs but no game breaking ones. Love the campaign 9/10
1277	0	a	I have no idea what the point of this game is about. no story, it's only a design idea.
1884	1	a	Yo this game is nice af doods. Good campaign, and good historical accuracy. 19/14.63 would buy again. (Plus all these nerds who wouldn't recommend this game have like 1 hour, and they don't know what they are talking about xD)
3066	1	a	I recommend this game and grade it an 8/10.  The Grand Campaign is immersive, challenging and entertaining - the mix of Grand Strategy and RTS makes for the most interesting game experiences. The period in which Empire: TW takes place n makes it easy to learn and hard to master, any move can be countered and turned against you - and with mental hospital patients who think they're tree's as national leaders - you have challenges not with the RTS battles just in multiplayer but in campaign as well. The AI is a bit daft.  The Road To Independence campaign was wonderful, however I wish (if it's possible let me know) you could play as the British (George III) not the British Revolutionaries (George W.) or as a native tribe (I know about Empire: Total Factions, does it affect this campaign?).
3640	1	a	I have been playing this game for a long time and whit the excepcions of some historical errors For example [In Spain] Charles the II dead in 1700, the uniforms from the officials NEVER were yellow or the flag of Spain is until 1785, the flag of the Spanish Empire (1492-1785) was the flag in the game of 'New Spain' (Cross of Burgundy).Since 1785 the Spanish flag that is in the game is the official. Excluding little errors like those the game is PERFECT.
4546	1	a	Totally worth getting. A space-RPG with some team elements
2355	1	a	I suggest you buy Napoleon total war instead of this one, the graphics are not that good the user interface is terrible and ugly, but other than that I love this game. Unless you want a bigger map don't buy this game buy Napoleon. 8/10
4959	1	a	Has the feel of the old Star Control games... Good little story, alot of fun to spec your ships, and an awesome combat system! I've had sense BETA and I still play it!
4707	1	a	I picked this up in the winter sale and I quite enjoy it. I remember playing a game called Star Control when I was a kid and SPAZ seems very keen to evoke those memories.  The bulk of the game is spent carrying out missions (i.e. quests) which will reward currency and/or reputation with each system's faction. Speaking of which, each system has two sides: UTA (Empire) and Civilians (Rebels). You don't always have to butter up one or the other, and which side you'll have to â¥â¥â¥â¥ off will vary from system to system. It's very much up to you how and where you want to go questing, but the levelling process can feel a bit grindy.  The combat is fun but not overly deep, and things can get a bit repetitive. I've put 30 hours into it so far and I've only really just got into the meat of the campaign I think. At a sale price, I'd say it's worth it. I wouldn't be disappointed to buy it at 50% off so anything else is a bonus.  p.s. If you're on the fence, TRY THE DEMO. It's a good taster.
3049	1	a	The best Total War game and one of the best RTS games out there.
1933	1	a	This game was greate for the time that i actuly played it but it kept crashing so i only got like 10 mmins of gameplay. everytime i actuly played it it crashed. soo yeal 7.5/10 from me. 
2795	1	a	This is my favorite Total War game!  Now I can truely dominate the World instead of a tiny island.
1496	1	a	Another great total war game. Own it.(not that every total war game is good,just saying)   Still has great gfx,a few shadow flickers but it still holds up really well maxed out.  IMO the best total war,cause i love line battles and the campain map is huge.    The worst part of any total war is the AI..this games AI is the worst you have ever seen in battle.AS most battles you will think you are playing MTW 2 still.Very disapointing.DLC does seem to fix this tho,i got all of the DLC and most of the battles now are pretty epic.  Very cool units tho through out the game,some DLCs to bolster the roster if you wish. I can't talk much about the sea battles as i always auto solve them.  Diplomatic realtions in this game are crazy,as the AI is below par and can not really do anything other then spam weak units for the most part and declare war or ask you for alot of your lands..just plain broken.DLC fixes them spamming for the most part,now for me they have to many good units..LOL    1) Darthmod is as good as a mod can be for this game, worth a look. or 2) just DL a small file called general andys sound pack. Makes the musket sounds so much better its badazz.And very easy to install...you delete one sound pack and just plop his in..done.  its worth 10 to 15 bucks or on sale as even some mini mods fix the game.  This game will be in my top 10 games in my lifetime...unless they do a remake.
1349	1	a	Started a game as Austria. Gave the Puebleo Cannons. Next time I checked they controled all of North America and had footholes in Spain.  42/10 would grant visa to Mexicans again.
857	1	a	It is like dungeon defenders if you played it, but yuo are alone, there is more fun and there isn't the multiplayer.  7/10
2877	1	a	One of the last good total war, just a bit rigged, but far less than shogun or rome 2
2716	1	a	A game that I recommend with Turn-Based combined with Real-Time Strategy mechanics. Gameplay is pretty balanced. The Americas, Europe and India are the playable areas that you have access to, with small regions just for trading routes. Empire: Total War is so far, my favourite out of the Series.  Overall a great game that deserves a 9.5/10 Rating!
3680	1	a	I love the game and spent 117 hours playing it but for some reason it wont open. I rlly want to continue my world domination but i cant do that when me game wont open! So please help me with this problem. Many thanks and plz help.
5051	1	a	@Skipp This one! It's really fun! 
688	1	a	Simple and addictive, set traps and shoot big green bad guys. Brilliant.
3956	1	a	Bought this game 4 years ago and continues to be one of my favourites. Be any one of a very numerous amount of countries as you gallivant about the Americas, Europe, and Indian Subcontinent, many of these factions with their own special units and quirks.  The game has recieved a major facelift from previous Total War installments, and is alltogether a rather decently polished game.  Pros + Very large map + Versitility of units + Naval Battles (With a bit of a learning curve, absolutely gorgeous to watch) + Hand-to-hand combat between individual units + Great graphical improvement over previous games + Overall polished feeling/ Good UI  Cons - The battle AI could use some work, as is common in many Total War games - The 'Warpath' Campaign, though flavourful and different, falls a little flat - A number of bugs that have since not been fixed, but nothing game-breaking (for me at least) - Diplomacy broken, the AI is often relunctant to accept peace even with a doomstack seiging the capital - Reaching the 'tipping point' where youre making too much money and steamroll everything, your results may vary  A game for any and every total war fan.
5044	1	a	it was pretty cool but they could have put a tiny bit bigger effort.................
3711	1	a	Very realistic and exciting strategy game.
4075	1	a	My most played game by far has the most replayability but its only for the patient and a more then decent computer
5288	1	a	Great game and story.
5265	1	a	a great game although between each of the story objectives it does require you to grind a bit
3446	1	a	If this game was a potato, it would be a good potato.
1821	1	a	If you have played all or most of the Total war games, you will see that this game is 100% perfect ..  The only problem i can honestly find about this game is the Electric bill !   
970	1	a	great game, challenging, but not impossible :)
998	1	a	Had more fun playing this than I've had gaming in some time.  It's fast paced, creative and very funny.  And lets face it, who doesn't like killing orcs with everything from floor spikes to tipping them into acid...
4571	1	a	Oh good Lord, make me a son and I'll name it SPAZ 2!
992	1	a	This is a fun, action-oriented tower defense game with crisp graphics and good action. I recommend this to anyone.
930	1	a	This game is fun and yet suprisingly stratigic compared to what it looks like upon first glance. While I am only partialy through the game, I have to say that this is a must get if it is on sale.
2742	1	a	I have been a Total War player since stumbling across Shogun in 2001, and loved the original Rome and both Medievals.   Then came Empire ...   Although Empire: Total War was not perfect when released and has had a rough ride over the last 5-6 years, it is still the one I just keep coming back to. There's no getting away from it - the original vanilla version was flawed but after the string of patches that followed its release, it improved.   Then came the mods ...   DarthMod, for me, is still the one that makes E:TW playable over and over again. Add the AUM, personalise your regiments and play on a custom built PC with a big, full HD TV, and this is still my favourite strategy wargame despite being an old timer in computer game terms.
792	1	a	Best fun you can have killing Orcs...EVER!  If you don't download the demo and stop reading this...I'll send an orc army to make you!!!  Great title, excellent graphics, very polished. Runs well on even low end hardware/laptops.
3174	1	a	defintly a hit for those who want to control the battle but not those who actully want to be the one fighting in the battle
4247	1	a	never played a total war game before...wow, its FUN! i see why there are so many psuedo board game strategy games.....this is the king of that style, BGRTS, they can coin them.....if you wanna fight for freedom in the most authentic way, BUY THIS!!!
477	1	a	Good game, gotta kill those orcs!
1963	0	a	It's a good game, but the Mac version is too riddled with bugs to be enjoyable.
861	1	a	More then only funny game... This game is awesome, you can't stop play... :)
1584	1	a	'Raise high the regimental ensign, my children! No prisoners! No pity! I will shoot any man I see with pity in him.'  Lieutenant-General Sir Bosque - shortly before his death at the Battle of Marseille.   10/10.
3778	1	a	All's Fair in Love and War, and this is a grand War indeed with ongoing Tactics and Enemies apon Enemy apon Enemy. it will take time a lot og time every now and then, but I give it four arrows to the heart with one broken walking stick.   Moxn
1950	1	a	Took a long time but this game finally hooked me. Here are the pros and cons:  Pros: - Voice acting is EXQUISITE.   If you are multilingual, try playing one of the countries where you know their language. The Tutons speak German, the Indians speak (what? Hindi?), the Britians speak English with a British accent, and the Americans speak with an American accent.  - The tactical battles are very good.  This might also depend on what AI difficulty you choose - but at a normal difficulty tactical battles are interesting. They might even be considered the core gameplay of the game, and avoiding them with autoresolve means far worse outcomes than playing them yourself.  - The quotes during loads are interesting reading  - The way the world is divided adds a new mechanic (instead of having one contiguous map)  This adds some confusion, but after understanding it the mechanic adds an extra dimension to the gameplay.  - Economic system is good   Cons:  - By now most TBS games have a consistent UI at least where outstanding tasks are concerned, but not Total War  If you forgot to move that unit who's been sitting idle for the last 3 turns - it's your fault. You should have gone and looked at a book or something. Or you should play Warlock or Civ or Fallen Enchantress or Endless Space because ALL of those games handle this exactly the same way with a list in the right column.  - Don't let the campaign turn you off.  It's not a great campaign, but at least there is one. The downside is the campaign hides some of the goodness the game has to offer, and there are confusing moments at the very beginning where the tactical battle makes no sense. [Not a good time to confuse players. Devs, I recommend 'never' as the best time to confuse players.]  - Sea battles are just too realistic (which translates into boring)  I know I know... 'It's realistic! We went to some naval museum or whatnot and got accurate reproductions of these ships and the physics blah blah blah...' We don't care. Well I don't anyways. Can't you put in a realism slider? I'm used to ship handling like in Pirates! And this is WAAAAY too slow even accelerated.  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Also, you can't really tell which of the various countries might resonate with you, so don't get turned off by the first country you try to play. I played Britian for a while, and then on a whim switched to playing India and loved it. The best way is to experiment.  In all it's a satisfying game.   If you aren't absolutely sure it will play on your systme (and some people have seen crashes), then try the demo first.
66	1	a	fun and entertaining, worth getting if on sale. all around good game 
3200	1	a	awsome love the game
1039	1	a	This game's a cult hit, and it deserves to be. Vibrant graphics (though you're indoors all the time), great humor, great gameplay (exactly what you expect) and enough of a challenge for anyone.
3370	1	a	 9.5/10 Similar to drugs. Great strategy game featuring war in land and sea , diplomacy and economical situations in the campaign. This is something even greater than Dota 2 or League of legends.   You have the ability not going on head to head into a war. By other means you can send assassin to kill generals or sabotage other nations. Or more importantly affect their economical growth by attacking trading ports or goods production areas.  Another part of it is to manage population and taxation , properly governing your nation to build the best empire kicking the rest out of your map.   Sun Tzu said : The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting. 
2763	1	a	Empire: Total War is a game where you can spend tons of hours. It's very fun to play if you like strategy games. But I must warn you: you will mostly play singleplayer. If you're looking to play a campaign on multiplayer, try the latest releases of Total War.
3016	1	a	9/10 Great classic strategy game. choose to play as any developed nation during the 1700s. inteface fairly simple. take command of single battles and turn the tide with superior strategy+ manage your economy, tech research and diplomatic relations with other countries+ conquer and rule the world+ mwahahaha:)  very disapointed it doesnt have workshop or updates game sometimes feels like pre release and napoleon should of been dlc expansion. they dlc vvhore and move on to pump out the next one
1967	1	a	The grand campaign is the meat of Empire: Total War, and it's there where you're likely to spend the most amount of time. The game stretches across the 18th century and lets you choose from a number of world powers, from Great Britain and Russia to fallen domains such as the Maratha Confederacy and the Ottoman Empire. Once you choose an empire, you can select from a few different campaign types that determine victory conditions and campaign length. Whichever you decide, be prepared: Even a short, 50-year campaign can take a good amount of time to complete, given that each turn requires strategic thinking on multiple fronts. Battles usually determine how regions are won and lost, but diplomatic relations, economic strangleholds, assassinations, and many other subtleties must be tweaked and considered at each turn, and they have noticeable impact as the years progress. If this sounds overwhelming, or if you're an American history buff, you'll want to check out the Road to Independence campaign before jumping into the grand one. This is essentially a long American tutorial that slowly introduces you to the basics and culminates in a grand campaign of its own.  The factors you must consider run the gamut, starting with an important new feature: the technology tree. Three areas of research and multiple subtrees let you improve your military, industry, and philosophy; in turn, your choices may benefit your economy or your success in battle. The benefits may seem minor at first, but as the campaign wears on, their effects are more noticeable, and your choices within these trees must be informed by the strengths and weaknesses of your particular empire. Do you concentrate on industry and use sheer numbers of troops to overwhelm your enemies, or do you focus on naval improvements and reap the ensuing benefits of successful trade-route blockades? As your campaign wears on, your needs may shift, whether because enemy blockades require a stronger navy, because you are spreading quickly across land, or because your economy is unable to sustain your growing army. Technology is also a limited diplomatic option, given that it's a commodity that you can not only trade during negotiations but also steal from foes. Additionally, it's not easy to convince a friendly nation to offer technology. Even when offered multiple technologies or monetary compensation, your closest allies rarely accept a request to share even a single technology, which makes it a limited political tool. In Empire: Total War, knowledge is more easily stolen than shared.  In fact, your more successful political dealings are the underhanded ones. Your agents may differ between nations (for example, gentlemen and rakes for the British, scholars and hashishin for the Ottomans), but the tasks are similar: covertly disrupt the affairs of your enemies and potential enemies. Religious agents such as missionaries will slowly but surely convert the populace, staving off potential rebellion in newly captured regions. On the other hand, the impact of religion is not as deep or impactful as in the Europa Universalis series, in which social and diplomatic events are more fully explored. Regardless, it's great fun to cripple whole economies, especially when your strategies work in tandem with each other. Sending in a naval fleet to seize enemy trade supplies, sending another directly into an enemy's port (and therefore obstructing incoming goods), and dispatching an agent to sabotage commercial ports can have profound effects. In cases like these, an angry, resource-deprived public and cash-strapped armies then ease the way for a quick triumph.   Overall i think this is one of my favorite games of my childhood, which i totally suggest anyone who hasn't been able to play this game to get it and try it.
3164	1	a	medieval 2 is so much better, different time but that doesnt matter
283	0	a	really fun game but i cant get past the first wave becouse  1: MY COMPUTER CANT LOAD THE PLAYED MODEL SO IM A FLOATING CROSS BOW 2: MY GAME CRASHES (sometimes even my computer) WHEN I CALL THE FIST WAVE 
5057	1	a	Fun and addictive a good time sink.
453	1	a	Started playing because I got this as a gift from my friend. CAN'T STAHP PLAING. I THINK I HAVE ORC-BOLA PLES SOMEONE HELP ME! (This game is amazing, in a shortened version of those last couple of sentences. lol, good game, guys!)
1715	1	a	Fantastic and immersive gameplay. I recommend playing with the mod 'Darthmod Ultimate Commander Platinum' for the most challenging and rewarding experience.
1148	1	a	Disciples 3 was a misguided affair. Buggy, unbalanced trying too much to copy from Heroes of Might and Magic it strayed far for Disciples 2. Reincarnation is an attempt to redo the game. Most bugs were squashed, balancing was redone, battlefields were made much smaller (so it is closer to D2 choice of who to attack instead of running around the field). If you haven't played D2, do so, it is still a much better game. But if you played D2 to death, this version of D3 is actually quite decent. Unfortunately the developer went bankrupt before they finished a planned Mountain Clans DLC so this faction is missing.
2927	1	a	very good game, i have played 8 hours in one day &lt;3 good game really
95	1	a	Hey ORCS MUUUUUUST DIE ... and u will kill the Orcs or they will kill u ... nice TD Game for Soloplayer ... many funny traps and gadgeds
4314	1	a	Played as the Seven Provinces. Conquered the world.  10/10. Would turn world orange again.
4360	1	a	One of my most-played games here on Steam and still my favourite Total War game of the lot. Especially with mods (specifically DarthMod).  The scale that Empire: Total War attempts to tackle is unmatched in the series. The execution may be flawed, but it's still a pretty good attempt.  It makes me wish for a collaboration between Paradox and CA: the former tackling the grand strategy element (what w/ their experience w/ games like Europa Universalis), the latter handling the real-time tactical battles.
4524	1	a	BRUTAL AND UNFORGIVING COMBAT AND PIRACY IN THE SPACE FUTURE. RESOURCES ARE CURRENCY, AND HUMAN LIVES ARE ALSO CURRENCY. IT IS SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST AND INDIVIDUAL PEOPLE ARE BUT MERE CELLS AND ORGANS IN THE BODIES OF MY FLEET OF GREAT SPACE WARSHIPS. ALSO THERE ARE ZOMBIES AT SOME POINT BUT I HAVE NOT ENCOUNTERED THEM REALLY, PERHAPS I NEED TO GET FARTHER INTO THE GAME. I DO NOT KNOW HOW THREATENING ZOMBIES WILL BE IN SPACE, UNLESS THEY TOO HAVE SPACE WARSHIPS
4952	1	a	Awesome game, tons of depth, reminds me of Star Control but without messy strategy getting in the way.
5125	1	a	Start with a tiny space ship. Kill some other tiny space ships. Kill a big space ship. Build a big space ship. Keep making space ship bigger until all space ships are smaller than you. You are king spaceship.   The zombies bit is mids, though.
2182	0	a	I only played less then an hour, but the games crashed three times. Unfortunately, this game had a great potential but it doesn't worth it price with all those bugs. Some people said that thoses bugs were fixed with the pastches, but no! After 7 years on the market the game still bugs. Be warned that you may encounter technical issues if you buy it.
1093	1	a	Not a good port, seems better suited to xbox arcade or something. Still liked it however. Get it cheap.
415	1	a	Awsome game, puts dungeon defenders to shame even without the multiplayer.
4323	1	a	hands down one of the best games in its class keep coming back to it love the naval combat love the era if you havnt played it give it a chance if you like these type of game
1065	1	a	Just some pure, unadulterated fun. One of those games where you say you'll do one level then it turns out to be three hours later. It's tons of fun and the fact that you unlock a new trap or ability after every level just makes it that much better. Only gripe might be that I can't seem to be able to control my computer's volume while in game. But it is still loads of fun.
4713	1	a	Awesome, Nuff Said.
3368	0	a	Unplayable due to blurry Fonts
814	1	a	Play Orcs Must Die! It's a good game.
2067	1	a	  It's ok
2501	1	a	Ever wanted to muck around with history? Well, now you can. As long as it pertains to the 18th century, that is. Empire: Total War is perfect if you want to wage war against the Ottoman Empire or conquer the Thirteen Colonies as Sweden. It also has references to many historical events such as the capturing and execution of Edward Kidd, so you can sort of use it as a learning tool. So gather up your men, cannons, and horses and go take that territory.
5263	1	a	In space nobody can hear you scream... unless you are on the right radiofrequency!
3744	1	a	Very nice, strategic game. Full of rich graphics and can be played to hearts desire. Nice historical facts and events are pretty accurate. Great game, well worth the money
2683	1	a	kindly looks over the battlefield and smiles, the flanks are secure, the cannons are wailing away, your ally is holding their side, and your abushes are working. At this point you believe it is all in the bag and that the enemy general should simply hand in their formal resignation to their monarchg immediatly and then be killed for treas9on and cowardess.   You sit back and think 'soda' you go to your fridge and get a pepsi still smiling until you see your screen.   Your ambushes have been killed, your allys line is shattered, and your cannons have had a firm horse charge up the â¥â¥â¥. Being the quick tactictian you first look for the cause. Obviously it was your absence and your allys incompetence, but you look deeper, how did your incompetant ally get broken that quickly when they were safe before hand?   after a few seconds of searching the battle field you see what has caused this, one unit of Indian war elephants flanked him and then went beserk on his â¥â¥â¥â¥. You sigh and quickly send a few men to kill this threat.  Next would be how your flanks became exposed enough for a quick cavalry blitz onto your cannons, your mouth drops open as you see the tiny hole in your line infantry, a hit and run. After you close this hole you turn your attention to how your ambushes got thwarted.   You knew that the ambushes were temporary but you did not know the enemy would single them out and kill them vicously. Your eyes dart over the area that they were in, seems to your quick glance that the enemy had used light artys with some scout cavalry to do this, you send 1 units of scout cavalry to look for this.  In the meantime your units have murdered the elephants, HUZZA. your incompetant ally reforms his now rather small line, you order him to march foward. He says that might not be a great idea with the mens moral low, you insist that he goes in for the glory of your mother country. He sighs and moves his small rabble of troops forward.   You scouts have found the enemy artys and to your great pleasure they seem unguarded. You keep your scouts in cover and sneak them closer. you decide that YOLO does apply to cavalry charges and send them straight for the poor â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s. SUCESS, much rejoicing was done in the scout cavalry unit, they only lost half of their men! a sacrafice well worth it.  you get a skype call from the enemy, you are now smiling for you believe you can gloat for you victory. you answer and begin with, 'so now we both have no art'... your enemy is angry and exclaims that his mother country is better than yours, in disgust you kick him out of the call and focus on killing his troops with no rhyme or reason.  Suddenly the silence is broken by your mens screams of terror and pain, you look at your main line and your enemy just dropped gas on your whole clump of troops. The enemy mortars hiden so well at the back of them map are now pounding your troops with gas. Angered by this act of cruelty you send all cavalry units to deal with this threat.   You hear the whinying of your cavalry dying, more bloody Indian war elephants have appeared in mass and are having a mass bouty call on your cavalry. Between the gas and the elephants your men have been slaughtered. about 5 squads remain, you reform these precious troops together in some woods where your devilish enemy cannot see them.  3 skirmisher squads (two of which are out of ammo), one tenth of a heavy cavalry unit, and a random bunch of canon opperators who had fled after the horse charge who decided to stop fleeing. Pondering for awhile you come up with a plan to destroy the enemy.   sending your units through the woods you watch sympathetically as your ally is murdered by the enslaught of gas and elephants. He retreats after killing half of the elephants. He regroups his one unit with your group of lonely vaganbonds exclaimg that you told him to go forward and that you got him killed.. honwstly you dont really care, you congragulate him on killing half the elephants and tell him to buck up for the mother country. He bucks up, you then look at his one unit of sharpshooters which had been using melee during the whole battle and had not fired a single shot. Although this is stupid and you feel like you hsould chide your ally for his continual incompetance you realize this could be useful, you tell him to follow you.  You reach the elephant killing ground and send your two dud skirm troops up on melee mode, as per usual the elephants appear and charge, you tell your ally to use his sharps to fire. elephants begin to die in droves. in the meantime your cavalry units are probbing those damned mortars so hard. The enemys general begins to run across the map trying to make a wild goose chase. A signle satisfying round of cannon fire is heard as your mishmashed canonners fire the last shoot. THE PERFECT HIT, your twit of an advisor announces that the enemy general is nowinfact dead, a fact that you saw an enjoyed very much so. With this victory the enemy elephants evacuate the premises and the enemy has been slain.  Just another day in the life of a master strategist 10/10 would have my time wasted by dumb friends not being competant enough to hold their line vs one elephant again 
2456	1	a	One of the best of this series. It encompasses most of the world and does a great job of recreating the power of trade and naval power. Where Napolean tends to focus on Europe. If you want a open sand box, get this over Napolean.
701	1	a	Game of the Year! ;) (Y)
234	1	a	Well polished, funny and addictive. One of the better releases of 2011 that takes the tedium out of the Tower Defense genre.
2855	1	a	Empire: Total War has been out for many years, and many other versions of the Total War series have come out since. Empire -- by far -- is my favorite of the series.  I'll start with the overview and timeline itself. The game is simply beautiful, it captures the period, and the gameplay for those familiar with other versions (Napoleon, Shogun II, Rome II) should be readily adaptable, as it runs off of the Warscape engine. So learning curve? Check.  If you're familiar with competitors (Europa Universalis, Civilization) then the game will indeed be different as a middle ground between the two in terms of complexity; more complex than Civ, less complex than EU.   In terms of actual gameplay, Empire runs the gambit between the major powers just before the War of the Spanish Succession and leading up to the Napoleonic Wars. Though mimicking Marlborough and carving a path of destruction through Europe is a difficult task to replicate here, there is enough to imitate. Each major power has its own war aims, many of which overlap others. One gets the sense of balance between the major empires -- crushing one completely invites opportunities from the neighbors: too much of a cascade, and the impulse to dominate Europe becomes a bankrupting experience... hence the chase for empire in America or India.  The battlefield experience remains fantastic, and thanks to a few good years of improving graphics drivers and the like, the average player can experience Empire: TW as it was intended by the developers. The fog of war combined with the sacking of a fortress, the annihilation of pikemen or the rapid mowing down of Turkish musketeers, the rush of Russian cossacks against Polish hussars, the power of Prussian cannon against Austrian jaegers, or the surprise of an European army coming up against a well-dragooned set of Indian infantry plus mortars? You really do get it all.  The DLCs for Empire: TW are modest and worth the purchase, as Empire was one of the first games to adapt to the DLC craze. Nowadays the DLC additions may seem fantastic and perhaps not worth the purchase, but if you're a fan of the period? They are not only completely worth the purchase, but Total War's developers do an excellent job of matching bang for buck -- if you are so inclined to purchase other TW francise works.  Downsides? Few... one can tell the difference between Empire and say, Rome II when playing the game. Later versions have improved the map, improved city governance, included more depth, etc. It is worth stressing that these are all *improvements* upon a very solid foundation. There are always rumors of Empire II, and one can tell with other TW series that such expansions can be instantly overlayed to a future run. Something spanning the Renaissance to the Napoleonic Wars? Easily done. A set that sees the Wars of Religion dissolve into the Age of Reason? Ditto there. Empire II -- should it come out (and I hope it does) has infinite promise... so when contrasting Empire: TW's downsides, one is hard pressed to see anything but potential.  In short, Empire: TW remains my favorite game in the entire Total War series, and I eagerly anticipate Empire II when the developers get around to it (after all, Medieval III and Warhammer all stand in the way). If the time period interests you, if you are a fan of other Total War games, or if you are looking for a way to introduce yourself to the series inexpensively... start here. Well worth the investment.
3539	1	a	Awesome fgame. good tactical and strategic game. very long. campaign is a littleshort but overall 9/10
4575	1	a	I love the elements of this which call to mind old-school shareware sci-fi classics. The exploration, resource-gathering, ship design, and combat are all very rewarding, and I like the cast of renegade characters. Highly recommended, despite a somewhat slow set of starting missions.
883	1	a	Very Very Fun Game ! ! ! If you are a fan of defence games, action games, or just like dismembering hordes of orcs. This game is for you. Plenty of traps and spells to keep you busy and entertained for hours on end. I love it and can't keep away.  -SirFrontsalot  aka TurboPreston aka Reaper
1758	1	a	yes because it is nice game and im a nice dog so there you go i am shibe i is doge
1988	1	a	Buy 'Napoleon: Total War' instead. Its multiplayer is actually alive, better graphics, better optimized, and it has one of the best mods ever created for any game. The 'Darth Mod'.  If you're generally a Total War fan though, it's indeed worth it.
3507	1	a	IT GETS ME ROCK HARD IN MY â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ 
2384	1	a	Aaaaaaaamazing. Just wanted to put another thumbs up out there for this game. Best of the Total War Series.
3341	1	a	Epic game with a good mix of fighting and world development.
4138	1	a	One of the best games in the Total War franchise. To me Rome&gt; Empire&gt; Medieval II.
2852	1	a	Has a very imperialistic feel :).
4630	1	a	Without a doubt the best space themed title I have played. I LOVE this game. I cant wait for SPAZ 2 to come out.
3674	1	a	By far the most underrated Total War game.
886	1	a	I never thought towerdefence and third person mixed well until now
3981	1	a	I've upvoting this because I can tell it's a good game, but I have one HUGE gripe with it. It's *incredibly* unintuitive. Nothing about the interface, battles, etc is friendly. The game is deep and quite complex, but it's no excuse for how unintuitive things are. It's like throwing a child into the deep end of a swimming pool with a cinder block tied to his ankles and telling him to swim.  I don't mind a steep learning curve at all, but even after having learned it still feels like a clunky mess. I see why the game is beloved among strategy fans, but few games I have played are overall as frustrating as this.   It gets a recommendation purely on the basis that it would still be appealing to strat fans.
1762	1	a	overall I give this game 3 stars.  the battle aspect of the game is good, but the diplomacy and the governents need alot of work. The thing I dislike the most is the fact that random nations that you have never heard of constantly attack you with boatloads of men in some random location EVERY TURN. But overall a good game
1809	1	a	best game ever if you have a brain
3267	1	a	I have to say, pretty well made for a turn based game, In fact, its the best â¥â¥â¥ kicking, butt â¥â¥â¥â¥ing, War raving, World conquring Turn based/RTS Game out there. Considering it is both an RTS and a Turn Based Strategy game. And that goes for the entire series! I can't wait for Rome 2
194	1	a	Really fun game, well worth the money paid for.
341	1	a	Brilliant game - really addictive!!! :)
3942	1	a	Best turn based strategy game ever.
161	1	a	Wow this game is addicting! Part shooter, part tower defense, this game is AMAZING! Not to mention hilarious! The point of the game is to defend Rifts, and to do this you must place traps on the floors, use magic, and your trusty crossbow. But the funny part comes with the way you can defeat the opposing Orcs. One way is to place Spring Boards on the floor that launch the orcs whereever you aim the board. This can result in humorous and deadly outcomes. Another example is the dialogue, just plain goofy! Plus....drum roll please....ACHIEVEMENTS!!! Yup another game with achievements to keep the gamer coming back for more slightly-stoopid bragging rights! Pick this game up! Its unique, funny, fun, and OMG FUN!!!
1942	1	a	Playing this on 'Very Hard' will make you wanna kill your self. It's not as good as the previous games in the series. Rome Total War beats this one by a LONG SHOT...
2253	0	a	Still has bugs , A LOT OF BUGS , unless you install darth mod.All we wanted was a Hearts of Iron world map like , set in 17th century that had the Napoleon TW latest patches added to it.  5/10 Great game for its time , except it had more bugs at launch. 
4344	1	a	Been playing this for a couple of years and have logged around 350 hours - still love it to death. Get a good mod (I use Darthmod Ultimate Commander) and this is all the strategy game you'll ever need.
3907	1	a	Aaaaa...Another Review on an Epic Total War game ..where to begin ? Awesome RTS / Turned based game covering the battles and skirmishes taking placing during the 18th centery ...and id Recommend to everyone
190	1	a	Great combination of tower defense, rpg, and physics = amazing orc killing pc game!!
3920	1	a	Alot of fun! i spent a couple of hours of playing i recomment this game big time alot of fun and thinking of strategies. if its on sale i recommend to invest on this game cause its really fun!
3662	1	a	The hours you will spend on this game is amazing. Let me put it this way- Nation: Great Britain Objective: World Domination (50 Regions) Hours Spent: Over 130 hours on ONE campaign Reason for campaign not being completed: BLOODY F***ING FRANCE
2206	0	a	worst game of 2014
4745	1	a	All in all a pretty decent game with enough challange to keep you going
4401	1	a	great game with an amazing campaigne but the campaigne can be better if they added africa south america and asia as maps were you can colonize and conquer the units need more diversity the line infantry all have the same i con just different colour sceme more units is a must they need to add more artillery aswell as faces all units have pracktically the same faces 
1298	1	a	Fire by rank is one of the most satisfying things you can possibly experience.
3835	1	a	I liked the game but wish the producers would have added empire total war multiplayer campaign. I personally think it would have made the game 10 times better but the campaign single player was the bomb it was awesome how you could take over the world i give this game an 8 out of 10
1295	1	a	The Ottomans tried to overwhelm my army of regulars with a few farmers wielding pitchforks. We almost lost.  10/10.
5285	1	a	Cool design, innovative gameplay, very long lifetime game. Good Devs and Modding Community, littlely repetitive, but who cares when youre fleet admiral, and crush ennemy flotilla by ten different ways? Try Mods... And Try SPAZ 2, with same refs, but totally different gameplay
399	1	a	Does not suck, much fun had by myself and others.
3394	1	a	A very nicely made war game. Good for anyone who like good old fashioned warfare.
1493	1	a	Empire Total War is somewhat comparable to Rome Total War; it has a huge campaign map and an amazing story line that lasts for a very long time. From land to sea, from blizzard to Hurricane, Empire Total War is mother of all Total War games.
1406	1	a	I've really enjoyed playing Empire: Total War.  It has the perfect balance between detail and size. Medieval II: Total War, for instance, has so much detail it's hard to look at.  But Empire is in that happy zone of size versus detail. It has great replay value, because of the level of gameplay details. At the same time, it doesn't get bogged down by virtue of being  too  detailed. This keeps the gameplay moving. I find it particularly refreshing in a Total War title, since I love playing them but get tired of the later-game level of nation management. In short, it doesn't drag you down with administrative tasks as the game gets into the later stages. You can keep conquering enemy nations, instead of keeping your nation afloat with never-ending building management, like in the original Medieval: Total War.  The level of advice in the game is perfect for newbies, or for players returning after a long hiatus. It really holds your hand and shows you the ropes, all without being too intrusive. After you've wrung all you can from the advice, you can turn it down or off.  The new battle mechanics of using largely gunpowder troops is a switch for Total War. Of course, previous titles were dominated by hand-to-hand combat with pikes, swords, and the like. Lining up blocks of infanty, by contrast, may get boring after a while since it has less detail. But that depends on the type of player you are.  Instead of concentrating all of a province's buildings in the region capital, there are now buildings spread throughout the province. For instance, farms, universities, and industrial buildings are spread throughout the province. This makes the game more interesting to look at, since it isn't a meaningless landscape dotted with region capitals. It also gives an added stragegic element to the game: you can pillage these buildings, and thus remove the benefits they provide the other nation. For instance, you can pillage a university and thus take it out of action. It then can't do research for the nation you're fighting. These buildings can be repaired for cash in one turn. But still it puts a monkey wrench in the works, especially if it's an advanced building which is expensive to repair.  The different strategic regions (Europe, The New World, India) feel very balanced. It's especially fun to be fighting in North America around the time range of the American Revolution. India feels very boring, since it's basically an inverted triangle. But still, it has a meaningful level of detail to it. It doesn't just feel like a sideshow, though you can ignore it if you wish.  I like that you can send trading ships, called Indiamen, to different places in the world to bring back valuable resources. So for instance, you can dispatch an Indiaman to the west coast of Africa to bring back ivory for your nation to sell to other nations. It's a good source of income, and I like the reliability and simplicity of it. It's a  very  nice touch.  Diplomacy has a good deal of detail. For instance, if you're allied to a nation, break your alliance with it and then attack it, you'll get a permanent negative rating with most of the nations of the world. They don't like treaty violators! It makes them think twice about engaging in any deals with you. So be careful who you ally with. Don't do it as a convenience which you intend to break 10 turns later. Additionally, there are 'historical grievances' between different nations based on their actual history. So for instance, the United Provinces have historical grievances with Spain because of Spain's attempts to conquer the nation. It adds a nice amount of...landscape to diplomacy. It doesn't feel like you're all just a bunch of random nations dumped into an Earth-like arena with no background. It feels more like actual history.  Unfortunately, you can't play as the United States. I guess they thought that it would be impossible to make it into a meaningful power with any realism. Still, it would have been nice to try! So if you would like to have a part in American history, it will have to be secondary part. For instance, in my first campaign I was playing as Prussia and conquered Britain. This sparked the American Revolution by eliminating the Original Thirteen's rulers across the sea. So you can be involved, but only in a secondary way.  So if you like Total War games, and especially if you'd like one that moves a little faster than previous titles, give Empire: Total War a whirl!
136	1	a	Pretty fun fps/tower defense game.
2205	0	a	Way overpriced and the multiplayer is completley broken for Mac, i can't connect to any other server that is hosted on a different OS. (A.K.A. All of them)
1275	1	a	there are no skies in this game
2184	0	a	down loading the game has created problems having the cd to load has yet again proven its self better down loading from has yet again shown me its a waist of time
1067	1	a	A ton of fun and so much satisfaction after a Victory! Not very difficult. The hardest Wave is mostly the first. But still challenging with a Nightmare Mode I haven't tested yet.
1597	1	a	Empire is a brilliant addition to the total war collection, love the battles over the seas :)
29	1	a	 Orcs must die  belongs to a genre that is obviously meant to be have repetitiveness, but in a good way so no reason to explain that . You have to stop horde of ogres from getting into some kind of orb that powers you and the valley. Use traps, weapons, guardians and powers to stop the horde. It may sound boring but trust me you'll love it. It has a bit of story that continues on OMD 2! so it is recommended to buy both on bundle. + Play as you wish. First 2 levels are meant to teach you but after that kill them however you want. + Plenty of creative environment kills available + Increasing difficulty doesn't mean the health bar will just increase. Instead, a lot of varied types of ogres come that requires good knowledge of weapons that you'll pick before starting the stage + Creative weapons + Funny + Really cheap on sale  -Just when you think you have the grip, the game ends -No boss ending, kill the last horde and the game will just end after a cutscene  ~Stages are not sorted according to difficulty well. There are difficult levels and some dead easy levels right after that. But maybe thats how they want it to be.   Overall I give this game 7/10 Nick Cage and a big heeeeehaw!  
121	1	a	Loved it! Funny challenging and engaging.    
5144	1	a	This game was made by 2 indie developers and is probably one of the best indie games I've ever played. It's well worth the money for the amount of content and replayability this game has. It allows you to travel between stars and fight or help the local factions (UTA and civilians) and forge your way through the galaxy to the core. The combat is fun and the tactics screen is surprisingly in depth, allowing for complete control of the AI controlled ships (you can only manually control one ship but you have a small fleet following you) for those that enjoy that. One thing I will say is that the menus, HUD and UI in this game are astonishing; it feels so clean, polished and futuristic as a sci-fi game should, probably my favourite part of the game. Considering this was made by two people and not a big, well known title it is a great game. You can really tell the amount of effort they put into this and for that I applaud them.  9/10
2477	0	a	A decent Total War game. I actually really like the battles. Most of the units are ranged which is an interesting change from some of the other games. However, I feel that the management aspects don't make it very enjoyable.
2725	0	a	Game crashes after every few minutes. Had to redo a single fight like 8 times just to finish it. Next fight same story.... This game could be great if it would just play without crashing
578	1	a	This game has one liners and orcs, I laugh my â¥â¥â¥ off every level.  Hwever, if you DON'T want a main character that quips every time he puts a trap down (Step right this way, mister orc.) or when you get a kill streak (Awwwwws, look who has no arms...) You'll probably hate it.
1445	1	a	Nice strategy game! I found the Happiness a difficult thing to master, and the camera used durring battles leaves a lot to be desired. Otherwise, a fulfilling game. Would be interesting to extend the timeline to the late 1800s.
1337	1	a	Although not everyones cup of tea, if you love mass scale micromanagement this game will deliver.  The odd thing which I think I have been fortunate to have experienced is that over the time I have owned this game I can count the crashes on one hand. Others have not been nearly so fortunate.  You'll also want to turn up the difficulty or you will wonder how the whole world wasn't conquered by this or that faction. In the battlefield the AI is fairly poor despite if you turn up the battle difficulty and is made up for by padding the AI stats. Still there will be times when the enemy will sit there and be happy to let you blow them appart with long range artillery fire. I generally autoresolve as I play for the big picture.  The naval battles are nice to watch but fairly limited in tactics. Basically you are trying to set up favorable fields of fire but generally I was able to manage favorable engagements on the campaign map eliminating the need for advanced tactics. Essentially two lines staggered will completly crush their fleet every time. Unless of course you failed on the campaign layer.  Haven't tried MP yet because I'm an anti-social gamer. So can't say about that one.  I can see why many think this is the weakest entry in the TW series but not for me I enjoy the original Shogun and Medieval the least probably due to their age respectively. Namely the much more limited options available. This one looks good but does have some issues but it is also the only TW game with such a massive scope and for me, sometimes that's all that matters.
1053	1	a	when you like RPG titles,you must buy this game 10/10(i never see game like this)
1380	1	a	After a few hours of game,  I recommand it !! :)
3185	1	a	What are you doing reading this? Shouldn't you be taking over the world right about now?
3960	1	a	i dont like the turn based but other than that the skirmish battles where it isnt turn based is fun
1418	1	a	closest thing ill ever get to becoming hitler. 10/10 would bang
2367	1	a	Nice game, with long term strategy. I bought it with an almost 90% discount. It does not worth a lot of money (in my opinion). If you like military strategy, battleships fights and more, stop thinking and buy it!  For me: 7/10
1159	1	a	I love TBS, why are there so few of them?? Even less are worth playing. Fortunately Disciples is one of them. Recommend
4000	1	a	This game is great for all thoose who like turn based strategie games and being able to manege a goverment along with whos in the offices, who you want to trade with, be at war with, have alliences with, and be in charge of (if you can convince the nation to let you be in charge of them that is). In this game you create and field armies and navys along with spys, missionaries (religious), and gentelmen (reserchers/ duelists). In this game you can also research new technology to take your nation to the top of the world. I mean isn't it always great when you just mass armies near a neutural countries borders, declare war on them, and in one turn have destroyed the faction.
1987	0	a	Never been a fan of this one. The map is meh and battles are always pretty laggy.
1862	1	a	entertaining game, the graphics are good, but i wish they added more variety to the unit's appearance, most of them looked the same. And i also wished that the battles were more intense, as sometimes, units would just stand and do nothing... game is filled with some bugs, glitches, many things could have been improved but other than that it's a great game and i recommend it!
2835	0	a	Whoever made the unit skins should go to his/her closest newspaper stand, buy a modelism or history magazine and study how proper era uniforms should look like...As for the mechanics, they are broken beyond repair, making the experience a pain to play through. Buy Shogun instead...
2686	1	a	Great
1666	1	a	one of the best total war games ever
4097	1	a	I think that the game is pretty damn good, and that's all there is to it 
2469	1	a	Great game , If you like strategy game , that is it.  Buy it on Steam , you wont regret it .   Stef Chief Warren Officer  Crash Rescue Fire Fighter Dept.
369	1	a	Quasi-Tower Defense meets Hack 'n' Slash in such a way thats incredibly fun. If you enjoy either genre to ANY degree, you're missing out if you don't get this game. It is amazing.
5040	1	a	This game is excellent. Fun, snappy, full of wit and really addictive combat. I could not recommend this enough.
4764	1	a	7/10
3865	1	a	Great for anyone looking for that true conquer the world game. Now it just needs steam workshop.
2723	1	a	very good game would buy again.
717	1	a	Didn't play much of it but was fun while I did.
1490	1	a	EXCELLENT GAME, BEST IN THE SERIES 
476	1	a	Only bought this due to being cheap... would have paid full price. Super addicting
1162	1	a	Don't waste your money on the buggy broken Renaissance/Ressurection versions. This here is THE version to buy. Completely rehauled from the ground up, with entirely new balance, campaigns, and even new types of abilities(cast on hit/cast when hit etc) it is everything disciples 3 should have been. I can not recomend this game enough to anyone who likes turn based strategy. This game puts HOMM to shame.
4294	1	a	10/10 for game playing. 1/10 for no Empire Total War 2. 
323	1	a	The voice actor of the War Mage Apprentice (the player) in this game is Robert McCollum! He voice-acted Wataru Akiyama from the anime Initial D!  Oh My gosh this game is cool, one of the best tower defence games I've ever played, or even enjoyed for that matter.
1641	1	a	Epic game play, never seen a game with so much battle strategy and formation technique in all the games ive ever played i could play this game over and over again to find a new end result or a new thing that i havent experienced in the game before. i recommend this game to any and all video game generals whos is ready for amazing battle scenes!
1147	0	a	There is a lot of good things in Reincarnation, but the AI and map progression issues have not been resolved from the previous versions.  In general:  The Good: -Fun races, lots of units, nice strategic approach. -Nice Music. -Graphically appealing, while not being demanding. Well Optimized. (Not last gen tough). -Good Campaign Storyline. -Almost no bugs or glitches (so far). -Leveling system is addictive and dynamic. Can have different builds.  The Bad: -Horrible AI. Seriosuly.  -Strategic approach is fine, execution is terrible. Weird and unfair issues with CPU enemies. -Extremely slow paced gameplay. -Difficulty is based 100% in the raw power of the enemy armies and it scales poorly as the game goes on. -Once behind it's almost impossible to recover.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Now, explaining with more detail:  1.- Disciples is a franchise that relies heavily into the management of the encounters you have. The main strategy of the matches rely heavily in how you develop your troops WITHOUT DYING, mainly because the game punishes you hard if you loose a leveled squad. In the past, this kind of difficulty was appealing, but by today standards, it's just not well implemented. The game is more about choosing the right targets to level up and not about the strategic combat. This means that the difficulty is developed by the way you approach the leveling and not about the challenge of battling or developing the resources.  2.- The AI is just broken.  During the map phase, all the enemy armies just clean the mobs and level up in a certain rate, making few mistakes, while you need to see your way trough the random neutral troops that can range from easy to impossible. While the idea of having a linear leveling experience is boring, making you roam the map searching for the right mobs seems hardly an improvement. This is worsened by the fact that you can't afford to loose a single troop from the squad, so you will be repeating certain battles just for the sake of keeping the squad alive and not loose time in healing (wich, too, can be punishing in certain situations). And you can add to this the fact that while you loose time choosing targets, the AI already knew the right path so now it's 3 levels abobe you and still power-clearing camps.  In combat is worse. Melees will approach to engage, ranged will target the nearest high priority target (weakest). No much variation there. All the difficulty relies in you having to clear the lesser troops because usually the neutral enemies will have an outstanding threat that you need to carefully engage if you don't want to get one-shotted. And that is all. It's an easy clean or a fight you will have to repeat until the mobs behave the way you needed or until certain platforms that give you power spawn in better positions for you (wich ends up being the only strategy that the field of battle provides and that is completely random. The AI will rarely use them well).  -While fun and useful when you level and clear the map, spells are rather secondary. They can be extremely necesary in certain maps that have incredible neutral camps difficulties; and be just a fun thing to do in other scenarios.   Don't get me wrong with this review. Reincarnation is still a good game. It pretty much is a revamp of disciples 2 with a new combat system that is not really that cool. But i can hardly recommend it with all the issues it haves. Gaming has gone a long way from the games that had broken gameplay and weird AI issues. D3 should have been the improvement in those departments and not just the downfall because they not only couldn't fix them but maked them worse.  There were other minor issues, but i settled with the most important in my opinion. To do this review i waited to play enough time, but now I felt like I was ready to give an honest, objective opinion about the game.  Cheers! 
2451	1	a	Pretty good game, my only problem is some units not doing what they are supposed to and not following in setup formations.
872	1	a	Very addictive tower defense game. Easy to play, hard to master. One of the best fun/cost ratio of the year. You must at least try it.
80	1	a	This game... the most fun I've had in ages!
3784	1	a	An Amazing game One Of the best Total war games so far. a great job by the devs at the creative assembly. 10/10
685	1	a	Fantastic game for playing solo, if you want co op then go for the Orcs must die 2
3883	1	a	Really Fun!
1525	1	a	People are right. It is glitchy. I've raged quit many games and had to restart many games due to glitches. The first major glitch is invisable troops, you could send 3 line units to a unit of rifleman thinking you'll win easy. Than BOOM appears out of no where a unit of troops is sitting there waiting for you probably thinking wtf were you thinking, lol. The multiplayer is okay.... but abunch of rule breakers that ruin it. The singleplayer isn't my style.... I don't know how to explain it, but I like medieval 2's single player much better. After playing it for a while I do like it, but it isn't my favorite total war game.
1008	1	a	I don't know why orcs have to die :'( . It makes me sad...
905	1	a	A very simple premise of a game - stop a whorde of orcs from making it from one end of a maze to another utilizing a couple of weapons and a variety of 'semi-humorous traps.' The orcs come in a series of waves, and those waves get longer and more difficult until the end of each level. As you complete levels, you gain additional types of traps, and the more you succeed, you gain points to spend to upgrade those traps to make them more powerful.  Overall, this is a very simplistic game... first person shooter meets tower strategy. But, it's kind of addicting, as the traps lend a bit of humor in to the fray, often being used to knock orcs around the maze and off ledges - and a variety of other things that aren't worth spoiling for anyone.  Wait for a good Steam Sales (such as the weekend one presently going on) and add the entire franchise to your collection for less than $10. It's definitely worth that for some nearly-mindless entertainment! And, with a Steam-based leaderboard, you can compete with your friends.
4788	1	a	80/100
5305	1	a	A great game and time shredder. As it was said by the developers themselves it is a game like the old ones that seem to not be built anymore nowadays. It's combination of real time combat with round based development progress are come along great. The visial representation is awesome. The gameplay has way more depth then one expects initially and the storyline is catchy. And Zombies. In Space!  Warning: Addictive!
1310	1	a	-Start as Prussia -Build an Army -Build one brig -Transport army of over 1000 to america on brig -Kill native -Now true European -Force natives into army -Force natives to fight in India 10/10 Would force Indians to fight Indians again
3228	1	a	Empire: Total War is a game that all strategy game players should own. It's campaign is deep and rich with content, with endless choices to be made. The Road To Independance campaign is also realistic and cunning, bringing back battles like, the battle of Bunker Hill, and so on. This game forces you to think about every little detail and brings out the inner general in you. The naval warfare is intense with many variables in play, like the types of cannon show, or the formation of ships. The animations of all the units are flawless, and seiges are interesting and challenging to the mind. This game challenges the mind and brings out the inner general or admiral in you. I definitely recommend this game for those new and old to strategy.
412	1	a	Frantic, hectic fun. Nothing is more fun than watching you trap layout eat up orcs like a well oiled machine. Oiled with Blood.
3500	1	a	Great game!
5107	1	a	Right off the bat. This game is a joy to play; I could definitely tell that this game was made from someones passion for classic space RPG. It combines mechanics from classic arcade games with modern graphics and a sprinkle of Atom Zombie Smasher; not to mention a standard RPG leveling up system; making a very user friendly, casual and a heck load of fun to play. With a variety of ships to unlock fallowed by weapons and other unique upgrades also customisable ships ; you will be burning through hours and hours of gameplay. However like most RPG games, quests does get repetitive after a period of time such as killing or collecting X,Y and Z etc and not to mention pretty mediocre voice acting. On the contrary, with new updates underway to expand the game, this is sure worth the money. I definitely recommend this game to anyone who loves classic space RPG or have good taste for games in general :)
3354	1	a	One of the better Strategy Games I've played. Hands down a huge upgrade from Medievel II. The only issue is that sometimes things get glitchy.
3047	1	a	The one of the best addictions that u can find on steam
1990	1	a	It is a cool game.
17	1	a	Me: God please show me a good TD game. God: Ok son, take this game ''Orcs must die!'' Me: Thanks god.
1080	1	a	This is awesome! Only thing it is lacking, whish is a major thing.. is cooperative gameplay!
2125	1	a	You play with soldiers and boats 10/10
1297	1	a	Empire: Total War takes place during the 18th century; The schizophrenic age of absolute monarchies, imperial colonialism, the enlightenment, and the beginnings of globalism &amp; industrialism. This particular TW has set its name apart from all the others in the series for a few specific reasons. Being the fifth title in the series and the first Total War game to solely focus on guns &amp; artillery, it had big expectations. However, upon it's release it generally got mixed reception. Many people criticized it negatively, but I believe it to be one of the better Total War games.   Pros:  -  Three separate theatres of war   The Americas, Europe, India, and four theatres of trade.  -  11 Major Nations  to choose from.   (All factions playable with mods)  -  The Road to Independence Campaign   Separated into four parts, this game mode acts as a tutorial as a general campaign. You found the Jamestown/Virginia colony and expand, fight in the French-Indian Wars alongside Britiain as the 13 Colonies, rebel and fight the British at Bunker Hill, and finally form The United States.  - Amazing  Land and Sea battles .   Fight Land, Siege, and Naval battles. ETW introduced naval battles with the historical, monsterous Ships of the Line.  -  100 years to play (1700-1800)    2 turns per year. 100 years. 200 turns   - Great  Historical Battles  - A  Vast technology tree  parted into thirds.  Enlightenment, Economics, and Military  -  Religion is a major factor for the last time in a Total War series .  [/i]Choose your state and spread their religion to conquered lands.[/i] -  Revolutions!    One of the best features in the game and certainly the most notable. Choose from 3 kinds of government; Absolute Monarchy, Constitutional Monarchy, or dare you be...a Republic? This was the age of many revolutions, and as such, you'll choose whether to uphold the status quo and put down rebellions or begin a revolution against your own nation.  -  Multiplayer   Land, Naval, or Siege battles.   -----------   Cons:  - The AI[/b] as in many TW games, is not all that great. - Minor bugs &amp; glitches. - Unfair rep in the TW family.   DLC
2511	1	a	Has done a pretty good job of developing on earlier games and updating them to a later historical era, including colonisation of new continents and worldwide trade, implemented better than I've seen anywhere else (better than seen in AOE3, for example). All in all, probably the best strategy game for that time period, but at this stage in the franchise, that's about what we've come to expect from Total War. Plenty of content and options, but not too much as to be overwhelming.
2050	1	a	I like the game a lot but sieges suck and are horribly unrealistic and bowmen shoot their bows maybe once or twice a minute, while musketeers shoot once a minute at most because they are too busy shoving the ramrod down the barrel for 20 years, it is like they are masterbating with their guns. The naval battles are moderatly entertaining but the same thing, cannons take rediclous amounts of time to reload, just like land battles.  I enjoyed the campaign a lot but the battles were certainly not for me considering I like historical accuracy and men who dont masturbate with their weapons during battle!  The American campaigns of indipendence are frusturating to say the least, you need to get TONS of land to win your freedom, some of it in Canada that we never even went to during the Revolution, let alone capture. So you are spread rediclously thin against the might of the British Empire and they expect you to capture what seems like 80-90 percent of North America to win the game.  The only units that functioned even a little bit realisticly was the cavalry but building and reserching is rediculously slow and expensive so getting good cavalry early on is difficult. Oh and when pikemen charge they do it with swords, not their pikes.  I only recommend this game if you enjoy the campaign games of previous total war games rather than the battles, just get it on sale and don't buy any dlc.
2613	1	a	I have no life, would like to see more dead troops.
481	1	a	One of the best games in 2011, I recommend!
3877	1	a	Awesome RTS that takes place in the 17th century. This game has absolutly stunning graphics. Command an army of 3000+ soldiers in land battles, siege battles, and unbelievably realistic looking naval battles. You can aslo choose from many different factions like America, France, Russian, Prussia, British, native tribes, and many more! If you want to play an RTS of completely epic proportions this would be the game for you.
3937	1	a	One of the funnest games I have played. Would recomend tho those who love in battle strategy.
1937	1	a	It's time to kick those tea drinking pomie â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of murica m8
3110	1	a	Fabulous game. The graphics are brilliant, and run well, even on the higher settings, i love the battles, and the view of each battle. The strategy world map is brilliantly layed out, its easy to see, and the countries are clearly separated. There are many different tactics and gadgets availiable for deployment, which means there are many different ways to win the game.  When i bought this i was new to total war, and it took some getting use too. It is a deep game, especially the grand campaigns, however, it is well worth it.  The only thing i dislike is the naval battles. They are difficult to control, very boring, yet somewhat unavoidable, however hard you try.
4202	1	a	If I had a better PC, I wouldn't be playing this... Still, great game...
873	1	a	Highly entertaining at the cost of little time and effort.
265	0	a	I played a few hours and got bored.
3364	1	a	I bought this game because it was on sale and gave some sweet TF2 Items. I didn't expect it to be any fun especially because I usually dont like stratagy games. I was blown away by this game. It is probably the best RTS/TBS I have ever played!
4971	1	a	This game is a lot of fun. in a nut shell, it's a 2d top down space shooter rpg. I STRONGLY recommend at least trying the FREE demo.
1783	1	a	Very good game, easy to play with pleasing visuals and UI/GUI. Can't wait for another.
54	1	a	This is a really enjoyable game.
3602	1	a	Best Strategy Game Ever Best Game Of The Year 2014 And A Pretty Cool Game 
3987	1	a	I like you should play
933	1	a	Delightful, dorky, rambunctious fun. It can get frustrating at times when you lose â but naturally thatâs part of the game. I will admit I am disappointed that levels I am doing exceptionally well on seem to be over in a few heartbeats, so thatâs somewhat disappointing. Nonetheless (and particularly when on sale), itâs worth considering.
2599	1	a	Would definately reccomend this game, great diplomacy system, amazing battle scenes and overall a really good game.
1436	1	a	Great, in depth, strategy game. Allows you take an active role in how the game develops rather than restricting you with a 'mission based' campaign. Multiplayer is good, however that is from what other people have told me as, due to my computer, I can't use the multiplayer. Anyway, great game, recommended to all strategy fans.
101	1	a	I really like this game. It's a charming 3rd person action tower defense score-chaser that doesn't take itself too seriously.   You set traps and kill things (sometimes even without the traps). There are lots of traps and lots of ways to play. This game uses a fairly simple scoring mechanism of kill steaks and combos (#of things hitting something as it dies) that is easy to understand, but tough to master so topping the leaderboards is quite the trick.  The price is affordable, the game has 24 levels that can be played on any of the 3 (only the last 2 matter) difficulty settings + a few more levels in the Lost Adventures DLC and I find it to be worth every penny.
5153	1	a	A little bit like asteroids. But, more addictive. Somewhat of a plot...but the story line is pretty mindless. Different types of missions but, it wont be the end of the world if you lose a mission. No need to constantly save the game. Fun and a good distraction.  
4593	1	a	After playing this game for 56 total hours and being at level 107 with 31/48 achievements done I finally managed to finish THE 2ND MISSION OF THE MAIN STORY LINE. I â¥â¥â¥â¥ you not, level 100 â¥â¥â¥â¥ing 7. I've revealed 70% of the universe, defeated everything there is to defeat and I was allowed to proceed with the 2nd mission of this game.   It's fun tho. I wouldn't be so devoted if it wouldn't be worth it.
4684	1	a	An endless grind of â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t that goes absolutely nowhere.
1540	1	a	one of the best games i have ever played i reccomend all of the total war series especially ROME
419	1	a	Good fun... easy to understand and many hours of enjoyment
1912	1	a	Alright so I played only 4.2 hours but from what i have gathered it is a decent game.  Pros: 1. Extremely challenging, more challenging than any before it in my opinion. 2. Absolutely stunning visually! One of the best looking TW games out there 3. Cool time period with lots of different cultures. 4. Fun battles.  Cons:  1. Way too complicated. Do the tutorial. 2. No rebel settlements. That means you must pick and choose your targets much more carefully. 3. Kinda annoying music.....  All in all its an 8/10 in my book. I recommend getting Darthmod for it and playing a faction like England or Prussia for your first time! 
895	1	a	Tower defensive game with a sense of humour, good fun!
2075	1	a	This is the best real time strategy game that takes place in the gunpowder era on the market today. The base game is really good with a easy to understand yet strategic battle gameplay. A nice campaign map which allows you to chose what to specialise in and when, and it somewhat allows you to 'roleplay'. If you like these types of games but after playing this feel that something is missing then look no further than the Darthmod Empire mod (DME for short) it almost completely overhauls the game and adds tons of units and factions.
4646	1	a	An amusing little title which took me by surprise. Lots of content and many many many different ways to play. I find this game to be wildly entertaining and it will run on a toaster.
5055	1	a	I used to love a game called Escape Velocity which is now more or less defunct, but SPAZ has brought back that classic feel and gameplay style of 2D arcade shooter + galaxy exploration in a great way.  Really nice art direction and a couple of extra additions in gameplay mechanic to the old EV style.  I'm not sure what exactly I would change but it would be nice if the ship and abilities upgrade systems were a little different. I think it's a bit overwhelming at first and difficult to make sense of all the different options.  I'm also not a big fan of the mouse mechanic for steering and aiming the ship. While I can appreciate a certain amount of added control, I much prefer a keyboard based rotation mechanism. The static rotation speed combined with the free-motion mouse movement doesn't match up and is difficult to use.
5253	1	a	Awesome throwback to the days of Armada. Lots of fun.
3041	1	a	The game is definitely worth checking out. I really like various historicaly based detailes poping up during gameplay, which are also nation specific. Great touch. Battle rules are a little different than other total war games, mostly due to firearms usage.  Empire has different way to use regions. Beside the capital city there are towns which develop over time and can be used to increase happiness in region, income, convert to different religion, or build research facility. Those towns can be raided and damaged.  Cons: Very limited usefullnes of agents. there are 3 types of agents and each has 1 or 2 actions which you might find usefull. It could have been more developed. Diplomacy options are very limited from my point of view, and I have not noticed any specific value in terms of victory conditions (allies, portectorate). Battle placements. Chosing a place of the battle on campaign map has little value as the area is poorly reflected on battle map. I think it is a breat loss. Additional battle fortifications are rarely ever available and sometimes have weird consequences eg. artilery after fortifying cannot be moved and even change of angle is very limited. It certainly does not look like it should. I have also missed Total war encyclopedia which would be very useful.  Overall I think the time period the game is set in is quite interesting and game is fun. Some things can be changed and improved by mods, which are missing on steam but do not doubt those are available.
810	1	a	A great combination of strategy and real time FPS. Your maze making, and trap combinations will either save your bacon, or doom you to difficult last second battles against hoards of Orcs and other nasties. The balance is great, the visuals fresh and smooth, and thereâs more of a story than it first seems, (Cocky apprentice takes over for crotchety old wizard. How many times have we seen that right?) with actual character development. This is 'must buy' in my opinion.
901	1	a	This game is surprisinglly addictive. Far superior to Sanctum in my opinion. This game is definately a sleeper hit of this year.
4419	1	a	ok this is my favorite TBRTS i like it more than napoleon or shogun u must test it....i realy like the american campain! ( 1 reason that i realy like it is the deplomacy...far the best of all total warr...)
2685	1	a	My personal favorite total war game
5143	1	a	Another solid space shooter
1066	1	a	Who wants to have fun killing orcs? Everyone, that's who. Few things are more satisfying that setting up deadly traps and watching orcs be violently ripped apart, sliced and crushed with wonderful cartoony blood and guts splattering everywhere. And who doesn't love cartoon gore? No one, that's who. I'm not really into the tower defense genre myself, but this game is not one to pass up. Fast paced action and dasterdly traps await you. It's also the first game that allowed me the pleasure of hearing a ten year old girl cackle madly after filling her spellbook with nasty traps and proclaim, 'It's so easy to be evil!'  Yes it is, small female human. Yes it is.
4850	1	a	What sems to be a fairly simple game is actually pretty deep. It actually requires effort to move from stage to stage and one wrong step sends you back to the very beginning. If you like challenges and space this is a great game for you.
2418	1	a	I am so bad at this game 10/10
5275	1	a	Edit: 1/10/2016 This game is still a blast to play. Get it and look forward to SPAZ 2!   ---- First things first, one of the devs of this game gave away a bunch of keys for free on Reddit. Just to be nice! That's quite the act of kindness coming from a very small Independent game. However, I did not receive a key. Instead, I purchased the game since it was available for $3.99 as a weekend deal.   I sat down with it once it downloaded, poured me a spot of Scotch, and started playing. Seven hours (!) later I realize that it was now quite early in the morning and I still found myself thinking 'Just one more mission'. This is easily one of the most satisfying Indie games in my library. Addicting, colorful, witty, and overall killer experience.  I suggest picking this up at any price, a stellar title with some down-to-earth developers.
3706	1	a	If you want to be hero i recommend you to play this game, You can change the course of American when playing independent.
1375	1	a	Â¡Â¡Â¡Now on GNU/Linux!!!
1412	1	a	very good strategy game 
1082	1	a	Fun game if you have nothing to do, haven't touched in a while though ^_^
5244	1	a	Lot's of arcade style space shootemup fun! This game should be in every users library.
1260	0	a	This game has a super-interesting high concept to it. However, without any defined goal, it's ultimately pointless. There is no end-game. Have fun playing forever, or, more likely, stop after an hour or so and never pick it up again. This is Jason Rohrer at his Rohreriest.
1155	1	a	Highly recommend this game. For those who disappointed with Renaissance and Ressurection, this game is nothing like those 2. The developers made very good revisions and improvements before they go down, and it really worth it. The biggest issue is game balance, and it can be easily adjust through modding as the game is very customizable, and you dont need to be a computer geek to learn to mod. There are plenty of mods in the forum that fix game errors, bugs, and imbalance, and bring in new elements to game play.   The only real downside of the series is the discontinuation of the Mountain Clan. I hope that the game will generate enough sales so that it can be continued, and our favorite Mountain Clan can see the light of day.
1579	1	a	Nice game, it is more better if Sega put Napoleon TW and Empire TW into one game
4014	1	a	Loving this gamen, played medival total war b4 but this is better :)
4143	1	a	I do highly recommend this game, although I really wish they'd bring back the Multiplayer Grand Campaign. Can you please consider if possible? Please &amp; Thank you....
629	1	a	Its not the most 'serious' looking game, and does look rather idiotic, I've enjoyed every second I've put into this game. Its got a great playthrough value, and the replay value is solid as well. If your looking for a fun semi-tower defense game, then this is worth checking out. Its all single player, but check out the second one for co-op!
3856	1	a	Just play this game!! 
2631	1	a	Great Game
1723	1	a	Empire Total War is the best strategy game to this day. Graphics, gameplay ect. Beats all the previous strategy games before it and it beats the shogun total war series. Can't wait to see if Rome II Total War will be the next best strategy. If you like strategy, then this is the Game for you.
3980	1	a	Over 1000 hours 
1652	1	a	ETW is indeed quite an old game however it is one of the best in my opinon in the Total war seris with tons of factions and darthmod does inhance your game quite alot but it is still an awesome game even without mods.
3709	1	a	MANY hours of entertainment for the strategy and history fans although not as in depth as paradox titles still delivered on the replayability.
2473	1	a	I bought it for Â£15. Worth it.  Shame it went on sale a few hours later for Â£3.74. Oh well. *LUCK*
1541	1	a	Despite having major issues in the begining, crashing, bugs etc, I really enjoyed playing this game. Like the other Total War games it has a mix of a turn based campaign map where you build up your Cities, Towns, Infrastructure and strategicaly move your troops. Real-Time battles from Open Fields and Seiging Forts to Sea Battles with fleets of heavy first rate ships of the line.  Still the game has issues but they can be looked past, because who doesn't love conquering enemy nations with several 'stacks of doom'.  Pros : Game looks great on high graphics settings. Sound is Great. Great Ship battles with a veriety of ships. 3 different Continents to conquer - Americas, Europe and India. Large open fields to fight on with large army's. Historical Battles. Able to save presets for troop selection (Multiplayer and custom battles). Different victory conditions. Multiplayer, though you don't really see any games on it any more (luckily all the achievments are soloable against the AI).  Cons :  Diplomacy needed alot more work, AI can be completely stupid when it comes to the negotiations asking for rediculas things. AI on open field battle needed a bit more work, but its not really noticable here when your having fun slaughtering them all lol. The battle results - Heroic victory etc displays wrong. Poorly Optimized for AMD Graphics cards because its sponsored by Nvidia. Kill 1 million enemies Achievment... ugh this is 1 boring grind, 400+ hours and I haven't hit 200k kills yet.  My advice is to wait for when it's on sale but it's still too good of a game to wait for that :P
818	1	a	It's a great, fast-paced point(s) defense game with oodles of ways to dispatch your enemies! So spice!
2306	1	a	IF YOU TAKE IT AS A TOTALLY NEW FRANCHISE AND GAME: A pretty nice game.I think it's better than the 'Making History' series.It has the campaing map that allows you to do strategy as an armchair general and a feature that I really like, the battles.You get to command all the units you have previously trained and the fact that an individual unit is not rock solid (I mean the soldiers move separately,some remain behind some try to get in front ) is really interesting.The graphics are nice,even for a game released in 2010.I like it ,but it gets a litle boring after a bit , so mods are really welcome. IF YOU TAKE IT AS A TOTAL WAR GAME: It's not the greatest.Rome,Napoleon are better.I've heard alot of people complaining about performance issues, but I don't have any.(Is it my computer?)Quite enjoyable , but more unit variety would be nice. OVERALL: It's worth buying.
1102	1	a	Funny as all living hell.
5131	1	a	i got this game when it was free and now i have to pay for it lol talk about a bit of a fail but still was fun
307	1	a	The game is hilariously fun. Wanton destruction in the most tasteful way, a veg game without being a veg game.
4194	1	a	Very awesome but i wish they still had the option og deplomacy where your allowed to get your allies join a war on ur side that was already raging beisdes that i love the game
3279	1	a	This game is just too awesome!
696	1	a	This game is, simply put, fantastic. It is basically a Third Person Action/Tower Defense game hybrid. I loved it. It is very humorous, but the story is not where it shines. In fact, the story is somewhat forgettable. The gameplay is what makes this game so great. It is challenging, unique, and most importantly, VERY fun. It also has a pretty decent replay value. However, I would recommend just getting Orcs Must Die! 2 instead, since it has moar weapons, traps, maps. OMD2 also has co-op which is great.. But if you want the classic maps from this game to play in Co-Op in OMD2, then you want to buy this one too. Treat it like a DLC to OMD2 that adds 10 maps.   9/10 (Buy OMD2 instead, or buy it on sale)
425	1	a	Pretty fun tower defence with comical story.
1416	1	a	Very competitive online, great history of clans during the game's prime, just a great game overall. Strategical, huge battles, intense melee fights, accurate firefights, and a very compelling campaign. If you're looking for a game to really challenge you, this is the one. Online battles are like a game of chess, one wrong move and you can be in big trouble.
3248	1	a	good but you should be able to play grand campaing as america 
187	1	a	When I play Orcs I feel my iq plummet like TV viewership around election time.  Building killboxes then listening to the orcs scream in pain brings tears to my eyes as I laugh at their terminal one-liners. I am a sick sick man.
1030	1	a	kinda like Lord of the Rings 
3962	1	a	Ever feel like defeating Cornwallis yourself? Well, here you go.
910	1	a	This is so ace
2690	0	a	This has got to be the weakest Total War title I've ever bought.   I like the era, it's just that there isn't much strategy involved, it's pretty easy to just keep maneuvering your units into better firing positions. The fact it's the gun powder era isn't the problem, I've played Shogun 2 Fall of the Samurai &amp; had a lot of fun, this however just doesn't play out well at all. It might just be that the setting doesn't interest me as much as a Japanese one, and the fact that there are little to none melee units to allow for more strategies.  The naval combat however is a blast. I definatly had a lot of fun playing naval battles. The ones on Empire are really a lot of fun, naval strategies is usually my weak point too.  But overall, in my opinion, the game is a bore. I'll keep trying to play it to try to find some enjoyment out of it, but I doubt I will, and will most likely return to another Total War game. - I'm gonna put the review as not recommended, but if you really like the era, &amp; wouldn't enjoy the more older fighting style Total Wars, then I'd recommend Empire to you.  Sidenote: I know I've only played four hours, but I'm finding it seriously boring.
2934	1	a	Probably my favorite Total War Game. I love how big it feels and how simple it can be at times.
4846	1	a	This is actually an amazing game if u can get accustomed to it's lack of AAA title polish. In other words, there's alot to enjoy in this game if you give it the chance. I'm hoping to get back to it when I finally finish some of the other games i've wanted to finish before this one.
2081	1	a	Out of any of the TW games ive played, I put the most hours into this one. Engine works great for this type of combat. Feels like theres way more strategy involved because of the ranged combat compared to the ME Rome or SG era combat. That all being sad, I prefer to play the Napoleon expansion, its Empire but improved everything.
2484	1	a	I like this game
5207	1	a	Don't let the simplistic design and humor fool you, this game can be very challenging at times. The difficultly curve is just right to prove enough challenge to keep things interesting and the progression keeps things fresh enough as to not become too repetitive or dull.   I love games that really give you a sense of progression and feel where your actions actually matter. The end-game micromanagement is just tough enough to keep you on your toes but not cause you to rage quit. If you like top-down arcade shooters, flying around as a pirate, managing your own fleet, saving the galaxy, or any combination there of, you should give this a look.
3100	1	a	Empire total war was the first total war game I ever played and (for me atleast) has never bugged out in all the time i've played it. the game map is much larger than Napoleon total war with America, Europe and India all in one game, this means that there is ALOT and I don't mean a dozen or so I MEAN ALOT of factions most unplayable but keeps the game going on for a long time (you will need the space bar).   in the game each region has villages or towns that will grow over time and these can be turned into reaserch, religion or industrial towns that can help you reaserch multiple technologies (my favorite), spread your religion or gain more money.  naval and land battles are fun, cannons play less of a role in land battles than in FOTS since you need to reserch different cannon balls for your guns to get explosive or incindiary. And if you want a new army but don't have a general you can just recruit one on the spot. The ability to build forts can help defend a narrow area that might lead straight to your defensless city.  the interface is difficult to get used to if you have played shogun 2 most of the time since text is small, borders are not very clear and the white triangle on the mini-map is hard to see through. I would reccomend getting a text enlarger for the game.  In terms of mods ETW doesn't have steam workshop but i haven't looked around for mods either. Napoleon total war has a WW1 mod for it but is much smaller with only Europe in the game and suffers from some of the problems above.  overall I would reccomend ETW to someone who wants a large game set in the American independance war era. If you have Napoleon total war and don't want to go bigger get shogun 2 or FOTS
4918	1	a	Excellent game considering the two-man team that made it. Themed well with plenty of RPG action for lewt â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s and shooter action for those Galaga nuts.
96	1	a	Awesome game. very fun. Recommended!
280	0	a	The sequel is better in every way possible. Avoid this.
3807	0	a	Just played 3 minutes of this game and had to quit. if youre using a computer or laptop with graphics cards and os that cam out after this game was made for some reason you can not chose high settings. youre stuck with medium or low settings which dont make sense. im sure its a fun game but not when all your units are pixelized shaddows lol
4299	1	a	I think this is the best historical strategy game. My favourite since release!
3559	0	a	This game is bad. Like, really bad. All of the great features that gave the Total War games personality have been removed and leave a very dry battle sim and a very, very broken AI. Naval battles are a joke, the last time I played it people in my own regiment would shoot each other in the back of the head. The game itself was reviewed by everyone as what it could potentially be after a few patches and you know what? Even after years of Patches the game is still not worth anyones time, especially not mine and probably not yours.
739	1	a	Cool because its a First person tower defense
3209	1	a	One of my favs and part of my must have top 10
3249	1	a	It's kinda neat to see guys get blown-up, maimed, and killed in a quite orderly fashion.
3289	0	a	Although I like the map sizes and the battle. The main problem, resoultion, I play 1600x900 and it hurts my eyes to watch it, really does. The graphic for the main map, not so great. The battles are lots of fun to play. Ship battles I have not played yet, so not rating that. Over all rating is a 4/10 from what I have played. Would I reccomend this to a friend, no. I would not buy this I suggest buying Shogun 2 it is alot better and very fun.
3383	1	a	Seriously fun game, you gotta use strategy and your brains :3
4480	1	a	The fact that in a free battle (skirmish) you can reap the benefits of creating a decent town, trade route and fight your battles well is awesome. Great game for those who love to lead individual troops in games instead of units in mass
4011	1	a	I love strategy games and this one is perfect. My computercan only run medium graphics, but the game still looks nice. Battles are so mucgh fun and easy to get used to.
837	1	a	Never thought that this was just a indie game. Add some tower defence with some Shooter elements and you get Orcs must die. Simple and fascinating. Sometimes it was hard but never unfair. But if you upgrades the units/traps, you will probably stick to the same strategy. So even when I finished the game, I didnt try out every trap.
4126	1	a	11/10
5038	1	a	Space Pirates and Zombies appears at first glance nothing more than a retro style, 2d space shooter. But after playing it a lot, multiple playthroughs and challenges, it has a ton of depth lying beneath it's 2d surface.  You start as the leader of a small band of merchant pirates yourself seeking your fortune by collecting mineral deposits call rez. There are rumors of enormous stockpiles or rez near the core worlds so you set off to seek them out. Along the way you encounter zombies and eventually take on the gargantuan task of ridding the galaxy of them.  The first thing you do is set your world settings. There's multiple difficulty levels, 5 or 6 in total so you can vary your experience immensely, as well as settings for galaxy size, pirate density and tech distribution. You can create a unique experience for every game.  Once you are playing the game has three main areas. First is the galaxy and system maps. You travel to different systems and you can select various missions in each one to level up your crew, buy or steal tech and collect rez and ship designs. The systems all have different levels so you have to decide what you can potentially accomplish.  The next big part is your ship loadout screens, tech and hangar. In the tech screen you spend data (experience) that you have gather to level up various ship systems like beam weapons or shields. Each level increases the effectiveness of your systems and some levels are a prerequisite to advanced tech. Like you need level three beams to deploy particle beams or something. Then in the hanger you choose which hulls to use and what systems to put on them. You start with three hangars at the beginning of the game and get four by the end with larger capacity for larger hulls.  The final major area is actually flying your ships on the planet or area of interest screens. They aren't always combat screens, some missions you might gather rez for example. But while on these screens you can switch control between all your ships as well as issuing orders to the other ships to do certain things like rendezvous over here or attack this target. Sometimes pirates show up, sometimes zombies, all depends on the mission. I found there to be a good variety of events and missions.  The actual combat is extremely interesting if you make it challenging enough. Because there are so many types of ships and systems the way you fight can be varied. You might make a fast missile boat ship and whittle targets down while keeping out of their gun range. Or you might make a stealth capable ship, get in close and crush em with high powered beam cutters. Or maybe you want to use rotating turrets to track fast moving targets. It's up to you, there's no wrong way to do it, and a lot of times you have to adjust on the fly based on the tech available.  Hull designs are obtained by killing enemy ships of that hull. Sometimes one ship is enough but most need 3 or 4 blueprint pieces. Tech for subsystems like weapons, engines and all that is obtained from planets either by trading with them or blowing up their bases and taking it. There's also specialist crew members who give you distinct bonuses like +10% cannon damage. So that has to be taken into account as well.  In all there's a ton of ways to customize your game and your ships and it's very fun. I enjoyed leveling in this game immensely. The only downside is the hardest difficulties are REALLY hard and you end up basically grinding resources in low level areas to advance. But hard should be hard so I commend the devs for doing that. I guess you could fly smarter, not harder, if you're really good and get by with less.  Finally there's challenges too via a little space arena the pirates run. It's a good way to make money and there's some achievements with it. Some are very hard.  This game simply rocks and you have to try it.
2261	0	a	it wont launch pls fix
3838	1	a	Yes.  This game simulates being a field general and sea admiral of the 1700's and 1800's in a fun way.  This is my first total war game, my previous strategy experience is with Heroes of might and magic, Starcraft II, and Civ II and V.  This game plays much like Civ in terms of nation developement with the addition that the combat is fought as RTS (very slow paced and larger compared to Starcraft)  The graphics are fine. Nothing spectacular, but enough that in 2014 they don't feel retro.  PLAY THE 'Road to Independence' story if you are unfamiliar with Total War! It does a very good job of introducing the systems in the game.
3884	1	a	My men did charged the enemy and a blob formation yet I still win.
1868	1	a	Great game. Lovely ship battles
1596	1	a	the game that got me on steam; decent game, but possibly one of the worst (warscape-era) Total War games (maybe even The worst); still, I give it a thumb up for sake of nostalgia (also because, welp, the game isn't that bad at all, it's just... very average, especially when compared to some of the other TW games, even the other warscape ones)
235	1	a	Best 'Tower Defence' game what I have played sofar!
4542	1	a	SPaZ is kind of a throwback. Flying 2D spaceships and accepting missions is a lot of fun, and I have fond memories of other games of this type. This one, though, feels a little lacking in some areas. You get a decent variety of ships and weapons, plus a tech tree to spend your upgrade points on as you level up. There's a big galaxy map, except that all the systems feel kind of the same. There's only 4 factions (military, civs, and bounty hunters, plus the titular zombies that come in later on). Oh, and your reputation with 2 of these factions, instead of being global, is system-by-system, and randomly determined. So, you could hop into a new area wanting to do business with one of them, only to find out they hate your guts, and you'd have to take missions for them (or bribe them) in order to turn that around.  There are plenty of randomly generated missions to undertake, but aside from a few plot-related side missions these are all repeatable and repetitious. The main obstacles standing in your way are the warp gate blockades, preset enemies you have to fight to proceed to the next system, so a lot of what you're doing is just knocking these guys down to get from A to B. Sometimes you have to train up and get more resources to take on a tough outpost, but other than that..  The big draw here is the combat, and customizing your ships, outfits, and tech the way you want them. If you like 2-D spaceship-flying games, this'll be right up your alley. If not, there isn't a whole lot here that'll change your mind.
2304	1	a	First Total War game I ever played and the best in my opinion.
2423	1	a	this game is awsome the dlc is realy helpful i recommend this game to the players who want to buy this game 
4624	1	a	Most addicting game I've played in a while.
5061	1	a	I've played all 3 Escape Velocity games, if that is what these guys were trying to emulate they failed.  This game is overly complicated from the beginning, it has a difficulty curve like a mountain and has combat that simply doesn't have a good feel to it, which is important as there isn't much more to this game. There is a plot, some narration, but honestly the level of the dialouge and the amateur art designs for the charcacters caused me to ignore it after about 10 minutes.  This is Diablo in space, you manuever around, try to damage opponents and mostly are just trying to click at the right times to line up shots against VERY agile opponents. You also constantly have to keep track of how allies are doing, your ship is usually worse then your competitions and there are more of them then there are of your fleet (as opposed to most ARPGs where you have an advantage but you are facing a horde).   It is very easy to die but that's ok, because using your mined resources you can then use them to respawn yourself and your fleet. But you can and will run out of resources, therefore making you not be able to respawn, at which point the game tells you to go get in a very very very crappy ship and start mining, but anyone with common sense will tell you to reload your save instead to save you the mindless grinding that would entail.  This is grossly dissapointing because I feel there is a lot to this game, it generates a new galaxy for every game which would seem to have a huge amount of content but I couldn't get past the second star system and had great difficulty getting past the first (which was the tutorial). Maybe this game was made for the nintendo hard crowd, or maybe I just suck, but I just don't have the time or patience anymore to deal with that. Although after looking at the universal badge progress on this game, I can tell I'm not alone.  Don't trust the metacritic score, although I will say there is something here but you have to be pretty dedicated/skilled to find it.
2394	1	a	i really like this game but it crashes my cp after a few minutes of play.
3384	1	a	hooked line and sinker........ little let down on city upgrade system as used to romes free flowing building frame but naval warfare compensated for bad build system...
4894	1	a	I used to love a game called Escape Velocity which is now more or less defunct, but SPAZ has brought back that classic feel and gameplay style of 2D arcade shooter + galaxy exploration in a great way.  Really nice art direction and a couple of extra additions in gameplay mechanic to the old EV style.  I'm not sure what exactly I would change but it would be nice if the ship and abilities upgrade systems were a little different. I think it's a bit overwhelming at first and difficult to make sense of all the different options.  I'm also not a big fan of the mouse mechanic for steering and aiming the ship. While I can appreciate a certain amount of added control, I much prefer a keyboard based rotation mechanism. The static rotation speed combined with the free-motion mouse movement doesn't match up and is difficult to use.
3522	1	a	While Total War Empire is far from perfect. In fact, one of the reasons you'll probably never play it is becuase of how detailed and time consuming it is just to learn. But it is totally worth your effort if you have any interested in this period of history.  Both the strategy side and the tatical side are well thought out and really get you in the spirit of Enlightenment Colonialism. Nothing says 'Freedom!' quite like watching your cannon fire route a line of infantry.  Once you get into the details it's really worth it. There's also a massive diversity of units, regions to play, minor regions to contend with, types of units, types of regions, religions and buildings. It's one of the least abstract and most directly representational historical stratagy games I've ever played. I can't recommend it highly enough.  Just know if you decide to play the long campaign with one of the larger powers you're in for a massive time commitment.
3841	1	a	100+ hours, anyone who loves simple controls, and intense line battles, this is the game for you!
5334	1	a	-go into mp co-op server -bunch of wild old men yelling -'delta 2 4 9er we need cas at coordinates 230914' -i dont know who delta249er is -i get scared -begin shooting -accidentally kill 8 bad guys -people say i did 'good â¥â¥â¥â¥' -get awarded medal -quit game  2/10 needs more goats
2493	1	a	Loved this game, especially the naval warfare. Steam says 169 hours but I am sure I had tons more offline and even more before I had linked it to steam. Though its unistalled now to make room for newer games it was worth every hour.
3582	1	a	Great game, great product. This is a fun, epic game!
691	1	a	A solid orc-killing tower-defending good time. Funny, sharp, and fun. Not really too long though. 4/5
1284	1	a	Indie game of the year for me. And, yes. I have played Bastion.
3223	1	a	Release-2009  Battles-9/10 Campaign-9/10 Multiplayer-8/10 Overall graphics-9/10  Overall-8,75/10
932	1	a	Fantastic game. It's like playing a tower defense in first person. Challenging enough but not so difficult you can't master it and 5 skull every level even on Nightmare mode.
1934	1	a	i took over the world with only indian bowmen and cavalry 100000000000000000000000000/10

154	1	a	its a incredibly goooooood game
5236	1	a	Do you have fond memories of Star Control 2, but wish it had more zombies? There's a game for that.
4973	1	a	I liked it enough to put 30 something hours into it. Try it you nerd.
2624	1	a	This is one of the best Total War Games out there. There are so many diffrent factions that each provide a unique gameplay experiance. It is complex enough that it is interesting but not so complex that you get bogged down in the micromanaging of your empire. If you are an experienced Total War player or a beginner I would highly recommend this game.
3922	1	a	Empire Total War starts in the year 1700. Well of course the British Isles were never full united at the time. All the developers had to do was make England, Scotland and Ireland all independent in 1700, than in the turn year of 1707 you get an Event with unifies the Scottish &amp; English thrones giving you the name Great Britain and the Union Flag of 1707-1801. Ireland should never be part of GB since it never joined until 1801, so why didn't they just make Ireland Independent from Britain and make them a Protectorate which cannot unite with Britain unless conquered through war. If there is ever a chance of an Empire 2: Total War it could be an idea that Total War could use, we have the technology!   Besides the campaign start date in-accuracy with the british situation I recommend this game to anyone who loves tactical warfare of the 18th century.
4950	1	a	A surprisingly deep space opera, considering it's price tag. Travel to the galactic core in search of riches, building ships and researching technology along the way. 2D combat is fun, you can tweek your ships depending on component designs you bought or pillaged and the game gives you quite a bit of choice on how you reach your goals. Kept me engaged to the end.
3103	1	a	I'm a big fan of the total War serias and so when I heard about the Empire installment I was thrilled and bought it for 50 bucks. Now although it's still a very good game. I felt that it took a lot of qualities that I liked about the earlier games and threw them out but also put some new qualities in that I liked. It was just a different game. I would still tell you guys to buy it though! Just the sea battles are enormously fun and sending 30 small ships to take one huge 1st ship of the lane is hilarious.
3816	1	a	i have played this game for over 1400 hours !!! i think thats says it all :)
508	1	a	Many Orcs died making this game.
4767	1	a	Great game, really deep. Hope the second one comes soon.
4295	0	a	Downfall of Creative Assembly, everybody acknowledge after time. For me its stared with Medieval II.  Shogun was a great idea with great potential. Remember how most Reviewers were asking, why CA dont do 2 games instead mixing Round Strategy and Realtime Strategy. Medieval despite the outdated tech, is still the best CA game, followed by Rome. After it, this game became junk mainstream. More animations nice lookings and more and more repressive to the strategy possibilities. In Medieval and Rome I could fight for hours, trick the enemy and win against a much stronger enemy and lose playing dumb to a much weaker. All this was cut down by a quicker and more spectacular unit porn. Shogun II was for me not the step back to the old traditions. It just gave us some more options and was not made so uninspired as Empire....  3/10
4761	1	a	Spaz 2 now? yes?
3213	1	a	The game is a great turn based game. If you like turn based games if not then dont get it. The map is hugh and theirs alot to do alot. a big selection of nations makes it fun. It a slower paced game and that works perfect for this game. Ive played ten hour and not bored yet. The options are good you have alot of choices for your game play. I would give this game a 8 out of 10 for now i will update later.
4537	1	a	A very fun game, from the start, it leaves you wanting to upgrade your fleet, as you progress, you learn about all the upgrades and different parts that leave you wanting more. It is not just about fighting, it includes financial management and many many other areas and all will add up to the excitement and fun you will have.
2708	1	a	Remember to bring a gun and you will survive...
3342	1	a	It might be old, but it's still fun. Empire total war is perhaps one of the best of the total war series for one single reason, guns! Finnaly no more special units that are capable of firing weapons now we have every nation having some type of ranged combat involving gun powder. The controls are like the rest of the series (supurb) aswell as the graphics and character animations. The campaigns are fun and ingaging, aswell as really making your mind think like those great generals back in their time period. I've played more than a 125 hours and loved every minute of it. But of course the big thing about this game is the sea battles, the first of their kind. Well I must say i have never seen such good water effect graphics in my life, not to mention the ships being so heavily detailed alowing you to see everyone of your crew working at your command. The only flaw with this game in my belief is the increased time and low improvments of researching. It killed me seeying all my line infantry only firing with the 1st line while the other 2 just waited. It took ages to finnaly reserch to line firing, and by that time I had almost completed the game. Overall i still belive is is a fantastic game portraying the beauty of stragety and the total war series. 9/10
2424	1	a	Empire: Total War, I loved when they released this I love the entire era of the British-American colonies, so maybe I am a bit biased. They made this game to be as realistic as they could (while still making it a fun game) there are line infantry that will only fire from the first line but in that time that was normal there are, however, units that can fire all at the same time you just need to find them. The sea battles was a wonderful edition to the game and I absolutely love it I enjoy taking a single fifth rate into a battle and heading upwind and killing several 4th rates. One unfortunate thing is Friendly Fire because, well actually thats self explanatory, if you have a single group of infantry units they will not be able to FF however if you have two groups and one is behind they other expect heavy casualties on the forward one, also careful on the sea keep your ships together so they don't FF each other that can cost you a battle as well.    Overall this is my second favorite game, behind Mass Effect.
5072	1	a	This is a excellent action space rpg. Multiple technology trees, tons of different ships, in a very easy to use package. I'm 10+ hours in and have only scratched the surface.
1062	1	a	This game is fun and awesome.
5226	1	a	What's not to love about a game that lets you fly through the galaxy being a giant prick? Tight controls and a very satisfying combat system can drag you into playing this game for hours saying 'Just a few more levels...'  The physics engine is on point and all ships have a very unique 'feel' to them, tight and responsive fighters, weighty and bulky Doom Cruisers, a little bit of everything in between. Be warned though, being a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ure Han Solo and getting your flagship destroyed too many times will have you farming up the cash to continue plundering the inner galaxy for hours, the endless grind for money is the only negative on an otherwise flawless indie space shmup. 9/10 
132	1	a	Greate Game!  Much better than the sequel, because in the sequel you get the feeling, that the traps are ineffective.
5228	1	a	Charming and fun. I can see why people spend many hours in it.
2156	1	a	It's a history lesson at its finest.
2414	1	a	This game is not like most TW games. It's slightly glitchy and unfinished. The singleplayer world map has abit too much going on. But combat is fun with a friend.
670	1	a	Most of us have a collection of games that we bought for low prices and have never installed. I know I have probably two dozen. This was one of them until today. If it's one of your 'someday' games, change it. Now.
4697	1	a	This game is... weird. I'll recommend it, but ONLY if this is your type of game. I really like the premiss and everything of it, but the only problem is that... well, SPAZ never really hooked me. I really feel like it'll get much more intiguing if I continue playing it, but so far it just hasn't given me any big reason to do so.  Like I said, I'd recommend it if it's up your alley. Maybe it just wasn't up mine.
1346	1	a	A great game. I'd almost go as far as to say that the replay value is limitless. The tech tree is large and interesting, so are the maps. There's a great variety of nations to choose from and plenty of units for each one. Multiplayer is a fun experience as long as you take care to keep the right people out of your servers (IE: clan players and other spammers.) This is to NTW what the MG42 is to the MG3. It's older, and it has its flaws, but god damn it's good. ETW will also probably last you longer.
3237	1	a	I couldnt enjoy it in its maximum because of hardware, but it is a good game. NAval battles, colonization and heavy trade-based economy.  
1702	1	a	This game's campaign is super good!!!!!!
5189	1	a	Perfect game to waste your time.
912	1	a	Sometimes, I almost feel bad for the Orcs. Except, not really.
4833	1	a	This game is a rare indy gem, unlike most indie gems, this game has more gameplay in it than most games released these days. The story is laughable and hard to follow, something about upgrading your mothership and getting a laser or something, but it does take a pretty unexpected twist in the fourth act.   The meat of the game is VERY customizable ship combat. Outfit your increasingly powerful ships with lasers, cannons, missles, fighter drones, and more. The combat is great too, the Shield/Hull defences vs. Lasers/Projectiles mechanic requires carefull weapon loadouts, and as long as you keep your less than stellar AI comrades under a good leash, even overwhelming odds can be handled with skill.   Also, SPAZ is made by a two-man team who are just doing what they love, and buying this game helps them make the game better. SPAZ has added HUGE amounts of content since launch (Namely the Bounty Hunters) and will keep having content added if people keep supporting it.
4903	1	a	Great time waster
3896	1	a	Exalent game with one massive problem, the shockingly bad AI destroyes this game mods will help you get through this so what I suggest is you buy this game and then get AI improvements. Other than that it is a amazing game.
1587	1	a	you will like this game if you feel the of powwwweeerrrr
4641	1	a	This game is still entertaining even after having it for this long!
212	1	a	As much as I hate Tower Defense I just love this game! It's very simple: build traps, lure the orcs in, if some orcs miss traps and live you just need to finish the job with your weapon or magic. And as primitive as it sounds it is crazy fun. So get this game and enjoy it! And then get part 2 and enjoy it even more in coop with a friend.
3006	1	a	This is the best game to entre the world of Total War. Plenty of skill levels and Nations to play. A game with depth that can be played solo or online agaianst many. Addictive to a fault, I highly recommend this game.
772	1	a	This game is ridiculous.
432	1	a	It is a good game, but you should skip it and go to #2.
3033	1	a	The best and most addicting Total War game. This series was made for the era of Empires.
4456	1	a	Well, a third part for Age of Empires. What to expect of it?  If you have never played the first two parts of AoE, here you'll get a little summary: Age of Empires I and II were defining new standards for the RTS-genre when they came out. Not as fast-paced as Starcraft or WarCraft, but with more strategical Depth and more focus on the organization of your camp and with a build-in history-part wich made the game even a little educational without decreasing the fun of the gameplay. You always could choose from many different cultures which had some units and technology in common, but some unique units and cultural advantages and disadvantages.  Now, what is different in AoE III? First of all, after AoE I playing in antique times and AoE II playing in Medieval times up to the discovery of the new world, AoE III consequently plays in times of the colonization of America and the civil war. Like AoE I &amp; II, AoE III contains many true historical events, locations and persons, but unlike both prequels, the main storyline of the campaigns is highly fictional so that it might be difficult to tell which events in the game truely happend and which are made up. The main storyline of the campaign is about a sect which tries to find and conquer the fountain of youth in the new world and a family which is bound by fate to stop them. On their journeys they encounter many historical persons like Georg Washington or Bolivar, but most of the game is about hunting down the sect. So the game is far less educational then the previous ones.  The second big difference is that the cultures do not longer have most techs and units in common but every nation has their own tech tree. Some things of course still are open to every culture but the differences between the cultures are far bigger then before. This isn't much of a problem because you can still tell the strengths and weaknesses of an unfimilar unit very fast, but it is more difficult then before to play a new nation.  And the there are the RPG-elements. Not only do you have imortal hero-units (like in Age of Mythology) which can only be knocked unconscious and stand up again if no more enemy units are around, you will also play random maps with a 'hometown' which can level up between games and send you support if you collect enough experience by surviving a certain time, killing enemy units or building your camp. Although this may increase the motivation to play more random maps they removed the option to play a random culture, which I really loved in AoE I &amp; II.  The AIs are weaker then in AoE II which is good for beginners but a little disappointing for more expert players. The balancing is also worse. There are some strategies to break the game. A pack of at least 20 osman heavy bombards, for example, is almost invincible. No AI-player ever was able to beat me if I got that far.  With the complete Collection, you will also get the two Add-Ons: The War Chiefs and Asian Dynasties.  The War Chiefs adds playable Native American Tribes (Without this Add-On they are only available as some sort of mercenaries if you build trading posts near their villages witch appear randomly on random maps). Although playing a native american culture is a very wellcome change and a challenge, it is clearly unbalanced. Those cultures are given many new and unique techniques like sending settlers to a totem and dance to do rites which give you advantages like faster ressources or stronger soldiers, they still desperatly lack heavy siege weaponary. Native american soldiers are only strong in large nummers and will have to attack early to not get overwhelmed by superior firepower of other nations. The Add-On also adds two campaigns which complete the storyline of the original game campaign by filling gaps and finishing the somehow open story. The focus, of course, is more on the war of the native americans against the europeans and so it is no true surprise that you will have to face general Custer at wounded Knee. Still the two new campaigns are much more shallow...  The Asian Dynasties finally adds some civilizations from Asia like the Indians and the Chinese. The storyline of the new campaigns has nothing to do with the story of the original campaign. The Indian campaign for example takes place around the fight for independence in India and the chinese campaign describes the discovery of the american continent by a chinese admiral which might have taken place (or maybe not) long before Columbus was born.  Overall AoE III: Complete Collection is a decent RTS game with some unique features, but if you were a big fan of AoE I &amp; II you might be disappointed because it is a really different game then what you are used to. Still it is worth a try. If you have never played AoE I or II, but you like RTS games, you should definitly try this one.
5314	1	a	I have owned this game for a number of weeks now and I have been completely hooked. Great game for the more serious war gamer, not for those who prefer the fast paced combat that you get from Call of Duty series which I consider more for the younger gamers anyway.  Arma 3 moves a lot slower and is more squad based than other war games, similar to Battlefield series only slower than that when playing online and you may find yourself on 10 minute helicopter rides just to get into the battlefield and you will be highly satisfied with each kill you make as you know a single round landed by your enemy could be fatal regardless of the weapon they are using. You will have to make good use of any cover you can find and hit the dirt as soon as you hear a bullet crack over your head and then very carefully survey the surrouding area and work out where you are taking fire from as it will usually not be obvious where the fire is coming from and you will find yourself having to hold up for 10-20 minutes in a single location (sometimes longer, I personally have gotten pinned in one location for over an hour) because you are either pinned by enemy fire or it is too dangerous to move forward.  You will need to buffer up on your mic communication skills as most players use proper phonetics etc when relaying information to each other on the battlefield such as coordinates and other reconaissance.  You can not respawn as quickly as you can in CoD if you are taken down by enemy fire so staying alive is more crucial than any other war game you have played and you wanna hope you are moving up with a squad that has a medic.  The graphics are great, the game is a little glitchy at times and the controls take a little getting used to.  I recommend buying this game to any serious war game enthusiasts who want to get as close to war as possible (unless doing paintballing or airgunning), and if you do buy the game - I recommend completing the whole VR Tutorial before actually joining a server or playing the Campaign as you will need to really learn all those different keys that may make the difference in a hairy situation in game.
3806	1	a	One of the best in the series, in my opinion.
1292	1	a	Years later, most issues are fixed and there is a host of mods to make the experience even better. This is a must have!
966	1	a	this game is so much fun.
4438	1	a	You will learn how to say: 'Yes', 'Ok', 'I will do it' and 'Attack', in basiclly any language.
3808	0	a	i loved this game when i was a kid but the game is broke get eu4 its way more realistic the only thing going for empire is the battles and napolion is better dont buy this game get eu4
1576	1	a	Good game if your into history/city managment, with darthmod it's allot better, i'd reccomend napoleon over this for multiplayer (There's no coop campaign in Empire) though Empire has a larger map.
3730	0	a	Great game (Always loved the Total War series) , spoiled by the fact it crashes non stop. I think I've played 82 minutes in total, all today, and it's crashed within 5 minutes, every time. I'm an IT specialist and a veteran gamer of 30 years (Wow, I'm old), so I know all the tricks and hacks to get games to run smooth.  This game is broken. 
875	1	a	Killing Orcs has never been more satisfying
2633	1	a	Despite having no playtime on this account, I've played this quite a bit on my own, now hoping to get back into it. While it's definetly not my -favorite- Total War Game (That belonging to Rome I,) It is certainly a better title than most of the other titles in the series (Excluding Medival, and Rome I)   My only real issue is that, partly cause of this, they switched to that damn engine where he troops all fight eachother one at a time, despite how unrealistic that is.  It's a bit buggy, and takes time to learn, but if you can get around that you'll likely enjoy it. If you enjoy this game, I'd suggest Europa Universalis, Rome: Total War (Not II.), Medival: Total War.
4709	1	a	I fraken love this game, Awesome graphics and game play. love the ship customization.
1941	1	a	I'm in the Empire business.
684	1	a	Similar to Sanctum, but more addictive with better presentation but no multiplayer. A bargain at any price under $15
2544	1	a	Its not total war, i mean there's other stuff in the game too ya know.
1859	1	a	Better than napolean?
5132	1	a	1
2024	1	a	- Plays as Britain - Is British and stuff - Does the sciencing - Is a pacifist - Hangs out with the French - The French invade - Science means nothing to bullets - Much Democracy Such Death Everyone Ded - 8/8 would get trampled for being a pacifist in a Total War game again
2712	1	a	Right up my alley. Satisfaction, the ocasional nap! engrosing battles. Decent tech tree. Fun to screw with history. It's good to be da king! And payback's ooh baby. I love watching the AI eat it. Kinda like watching your cat screw up. Knowing someone saw it. Yep, was good for me.
962	1	a	Hordes of Orcs and unlimited traps
4245	1	a	10/10 would destroy Russia again
1056	1	a	Watch 'em dyin'
75	1	a	Orc's must die and Orc's must die 2 is an addictive, fast bpaced and incredibly fun game. It's easy to pick up the game play and the UI is intuitive and well made. The Graphics and color is Awesome !! The music really sets the mode and is really cool. I would recemend this game to anyone... ( 5 out of 5 stars) BO
4735	1	a	A 2d Eve Online meets Subspace meets...Asteroids?  Game took a little bit to grab me, but it's loads of fun.
798	1	a	It might be singleplayer only, but I haven't had this much fun with a game since I first played Team Fortress.
2082	1	a	Do they have this on for Apple computers?
2236	0	a	Honestly, for a guy who's starting to getting into the whole Total war series thanks to Medieval 2, This is by far, besides Rome 2 which I do not own but imagine I will in the future, the worst Total war game I have ever played. I honestly felt having more fun with Napoleon Total war than this game because while that game is technically just this game in Europe, at least the game kinda felt more fun than this game is. The music in Empire Total war is pretty bland, the game play is boring. The only thing I like about this is that you could play as the Native Americans if you own the DLC which is worth 10 dollars (not worth it). Stay away from this game, I honestly think the hype on this game is total B.S.
3771	1	a	Three words: Empire total war 20/10
858	1	a	Awesome game! One of the best in Hero Tower Defense genre.
5039	1	a	I logged over a hundred hours on this puppy! It is a LOT of fun. Five cents an hour for great fun? Can't beat it.
1537	1	a	An great Real-Time &amp; Based on turn strategy game , i highly recommend it
1964	0	a	Cannister shot VS cavalry simulator
1739	1	a	What I like about this game is that you can turn history on your own imagination. I annhialated Austria, massacred Poland, bombarded sweden like there was no tomorrow, and currently in the process of invading America.  Sadly, all of them was done offline.  10/10
1683	1	a	In my top 5 most played game of all time. This game is great. I'd recommend for anyone.
2494	1	a	One of the best empire buildin games there is. Check it out. Highly recommended.
4481	1	a	 âI prefer face-to-face conversations. In case the situation turns bad, I know exactly who needs to be blown up.â   Space Pirates and Zombies (SPAZ) is a hybrid 2-D space simulation crossed with a real-time strategy game developed by the company Minmax Games with emphasis on combat mechanics and tactics.    Atmosphere &amp; presentation:   + Large amount of ships with creative designs guarantee a lot of variety and enable a corresponding learning curve. + The salvage and mining mechanics keep up the motivation to explore new star systems.  + Size and mass of ships influence movement and inertia of each vehicle. + Late game introduces an ever shifting equilibrium of power.  o The faction system adds an interesting dimension to the game, but it has little impact on the behaviour or decision making of the player.   - Amount of side missions and randomly generated events throughout the galaxy are limited and repetitive.  - The musical background lacks variety.    Combat &amp; gameplay:   + Fluent combat mechanics create a dynamic battlefield with focus on tactical positioning.  + Each ship offers different customization options for weapon and auxiliary systems, which benefits the tactical spectrum of the game.  + Easy-to-learn-but-hard-to-master skill tree challenges the player to gain more experience.  + Late game requires a more strategic approach of the evolving situation.   o Everything on the map can be attacked and destroyed.   Characters &amp; story:   + Story telling has a surprising and refreshing twist. + Well done integration and development of the zombie threat.  o Stereotypical portrayal of characters.   - Very little voice acting during the entire game.   Summary:   Minmax Games succeeded in creating a well-rounded game with only a few rough edges. SPAZ delivers much more action and tactics than one might expect of this indie title. The urge to unlock the next ship class, spending points on the elaborate skill tree or collecting credits for the next weapon upgrade will keep you up late into the night. And the entertaining zombie plot will come around the corner when you least expect it.    Achievements:   Estimated time for 100 % completion: +50 hours  Singleplayer achievements: 48 Multiplayer achievements: none    Chronology:    Space Pirates and Zombies 2 (PC) 3-D space simulation + real-time strategy  (Science-Fiction) â Planed release in 2016  Space Pirates and Zombies (PC) 2-D space simulation + real-time strategy  (Science-Fiction) â 2011
3086	1	a	Empire had a real bad start. I remember it was heavy for even a highend machine. But if you want to enjoy the maximum graphic from such a game you need a really modern machine. For the rest it's fun especially if you play England as you really enbarc on the colonial adventure both on east cost of America to crush the rebels and aquire power in India. I strongly recommend the game with all its DLCs
1744	1	a	The British Are Coming!
3639	1	a	This game is awsome try it out.
790	1	a	A fun game with orcs that must die
1946	1	a	This is my all time favorite turn based strategy game! I never get tired of playing it. The possible scenarios seem endless. If a few DarthMod options (more promotions, unit names, adjustable turns per year, etc) had been incorporated into the original release it would be perfect. The absence of a Steam workshop is highly disappointing!
783	1	a	Very Fun mix of a Castle Defense and 3rd person Action game.Can play a round in 20 minutes or less or play for hours. Lots of replay-ability and fun combos with the traps.
4838	1	a	You gotta play this game!
2498	1	a	very good game ya'll should play this game
3142	1	a	PLAY TEH MOTHERâ¥â¥â¥â¥IN GAME!!! YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT. The AI isn't all so great but the game and the campaign is awesome, I've logged almosed 200 hours into this game, it is truly a good game
3627	1	a	Is very nice, i give it 8/10 rubber dickbutts
3184	1	a	this is a very good game it so awesome
3797	1	a	1800th century combat with all its pros and cons. Campain AI is ok but there are some stupidity there to get annoyed with (failing to form up piles of soldiers in one army). Battle AI is lacking during sieges and during battles. Increased difficulties means more morale for the AI. A few mods increases the playablilty somewhat but the sometimes odd AI behaviour still is there (unmoddable). The steam rolling effect comes into play during mid/late game which means you dont have to command the battles yourself. You will win anyway. Multiplayer hasnt been tested yet.
2567	1	a	This is one of my favorite strategy game.
2006	1	a	I decided to play as Sweden. After the first turn I got a trade agreement with Great Britain and became allies. The next turn Great Britain betrayed me and made it their number one goal to destroy me. So I took over England, Scotland, and Ireland. Then I went on to make the glorious Swedish Empire.   10/10 would be betrayed by Britain again
1880	1	a	There are two things that I am honestly obsessed with: genocide of native peoples as a result of european colonialism, and Tim Gunn's guide to style. This game satifies both urges.
4371	1	a	10/10 would make america great again :)
2639	1	a	Took over the world as British, a glorious campaign, 10/10 would do it again!  Playing around with different factions and trying different tactics makes this game easily replayable. Loosing many hundreds of hours into it easy.   Total War series is popular for its large scale battles, with muskets and baynets its no different, gloriously executed, and well made. Capturing the era wonderfully.   I love unleashing cannon bombardments on enemy fortifcations! Boomtastic!
2954	1	a	Great game! The grand campaign is extremely fun, not to mention the multiplayer and single player battles. Road to Independence is also good.
686	1	a	This game is incredibley fun if you love seting up your on personal sen's funhouse and killing orcs like its an average day at the office. So have fun commiting genicide.
250	0	a	Spent about an hour with it. Read how good it was in the reviews but this got way too old way too fast. Bought it on a sale so it wasn't that big of a deal for a dollar. I've spent more on worse.
2642	1	a	I got steam to play this game back when everyone hated steam because you needed it to play this game. Coming back to it after years of break I have to say it really does live up to the nostalgia (though maybe not fully, there's no longer the secndary school lessons to ignore while me and my friends discuss our latest exploits as Britain beating the damned frogs, but that is not the game's fault - rather a symtop of getting older).  The campagn is one of the best in the Total War series mathed, in my oppinion, only by Napoleon. You play as a nation across 3 campaign maps that are vibrant and filled with smaller towns outside your cities. This gives the whole game a much more upbeat and immersive feel to the earlier Rome.  Battles are great in the way that Total War games are.   Though many of the things in this game were improved on and developed in Napoleon this game gives a wonderful experiece of the enlightenment era through the eyes of the military that you don't find anywhere else - it offers smething much more pretty and in depth that the grand stragegy games of Paradox and its a much more historical and cohesive experiece than other historical games. Empire hits a sweet spot between complexity and polish that makes it a wonderful game to this date,
2490	1	a	Where can you play online campaign?
2814	1	a	A very strategic game. Is a mix between Axis and Allies and Memoir 44. I would give it an A+ because it really gets the blood flowing during battles.
22	1	a	Really fun take on tower defense. good design. AAA art quality.
5307	1	a	This game has all the makings of random giggles and chaotic juicy farts. Makes for an interesting yet fun time. I would recommend this game just on the fact that its so simple yet fun with random humor added. The best part is the huge lack of a full crew to have created it yet it costs next to nothing for how much fun you get out of it.
1740	1	a	Great Strategy game with First time Naval Wars.
5180	1	a	A lot of fun. A good buy if on sell. 
4035	1	a	Excellent game with great replay value due to varying victory conditions and geography.  You must make sure to pay attention to terrain and don't let your infantry wander in front of your cannon because they simply will not stop.
7	1	a	  Originally posted by  The TL,DR Genie :
1608	1	a	It like the castle game. Big army, but no stabby stabby, shoot with big gun this time. Have elephants. Ships too. Not a shamerfur display though, that comes later
3892	1	a	Great game if you wish to rule an empire and take over the world but you have to be very patient
943	1	a	Loads of fun.
401	1	a	Kill orcs.
3793	1	a	This game in mediocre

1656	1	a	Good Game, Fun with and without mods :D
2510	1	a	I am a long-time student of linear warfare - the American Civil War and War of the Revolution in particular. However I have been fascinated with the evolution of linear tactics over the ages as well. The Total War series of computer games I believe provides an easy-to-learn illustration of how linear tactics have evolved. The game also provides a format for role-playing on the national policy level which, in this day and age, is important for citizens to understand as we watch what is happening on the news.  Empire is a very good tool with which to learn and gain understanding of how nations were built and why our globe functions as it does today.
155	1	a	Bullet Point Review :  + Action packed and fast paced + Challenging when reaching the endgame + Cool soundtrack + Witty humor + Smooth looking graphics + The game really motivates you to finish it, which immediately sets it aside from 9 out of 10 games.  - Danger of getting stuck, especially for casual gamers. ( Real casual gamers, not the term 'casual' hardcore gamers like to use for the average gamer ) - Repetitive to a certain degree - Bullet projectiles make no sense ( you have to aim above the head to get a headshot )  Conclusion : 9/10
1397	1	a	the best total war ever made
1943	1	a	it is a 100% brilliant game i would play it everyday
5199	1	a	it was pretty cool but they could have put a tiny bit bigger effort.................
3178	1	a	Its a very good game!
3387	1	a	Adds an interesting twist to the Total War series. Just as with real war, guns really change the way you play. It's fun, but i'd suggest trying out Rome: Total War or something else first, then going to this.
1660	1	a	Take over the world and laugh as your enemies are destroyed by your superior technology and troops. I managed to complete 'World Domination' starting as France, so you can win with basically any nation. My personal favorite thing to do was to send over 1000 troops to take out roughly 180 musket-armed citizens. Overkill at its best. Basically, world domination, needless slaughter, and diplomatic control over the people you didn't attack... yet. What's not to like?
289	1	a	Orcs Must Die is a dating simulator based on actual events, about a guy who lives in a castle and joins a shady online dating service. He then spends the rest of his life attempting to interview these would-be green suitors to find the love of his life. Sadly, his dates often rush the gates and fall victim to the castle's insanely jealous defense system. It's up to our fair prince to use his trusty Crossbow of Love and his Sword of Choosing to place that special touch on the suitors that meet his fancy, and who aren't grieviously injured by the castle.  All in all, I found this to be a very tragic tale, as well as a cautious reminder of the horrors of online dating. It's also a really great game, even if you don't usually happen to like historical-based dating simulators.
4883	1	a	It's the best 2 dollars I will ever spend...A MUST HAVE for anyone that likes shooters, space, or LAZERS! Top notch space shooter with rpg styled upgrades. Can't say enough good things about it!  
4985	1	a	Best game ever. Great 2D space action sim with RPG elements. Buy it!
785	1	a	This game is cute. Good personality, good graphics, satisfying traps. challenging to build an optimal route. Only a few kinds of enemies, the 'gotta shoot them in the head' thing gets annoying after a while.
1125	1	a	Still one of the best 'tower defense' out there. Solid gameplay with equal hilarity to match. I highly recommend giving this game a shot :)
203	1	a	I'd let those damn orcs win if they stop running straight in to arrow traps and spike traps and falling in to acid pits the damn orcs got â¥â¥â¥â¥ing rocks for brains
2090	1	a	Good Medieval II successor, but lacks XVII century and some European campaigns.
2071	1	a	Great game its really fun
361	1	a	pretty sweet game...to bad u missed out on the 75%off sale!
3966	1	a	Played it for a bit. Gets repetitive around hour 1000. Still I would recommend it.
2491	1	a	This game has sweeping visuals, whether you are in a high stakes battle a sea or fighting across the hilly plains of europe, the game looks amazing. Engage in intense battles all across the world with the armies and navies of several european powers, Indian dynasties, and the peoples of North America. This game is really fun for people with deep tactical knowledge andthe smarts to defeat actuall people while playing online. 
2032	1	a	this is a great game and even if you dont have a very good computer i fully recommend this game
3356	1	a	Take up the throne of one of the most powerful nations and try to conquer all the worlds theartes by peace or by force. watch your enemys and take their lands and see their weak forces try to defend their home but your men break them with ease. command the varios troops to use at their best for you will need to if you will conquer the world.
704	1	a	Stupid fun, but it gets really hard down the road. Army of Darkness feeling, and full of cheesy lines.
475	1	a	If you love trap games + tower defense, or just miss the old 'Dungeon Keeper' franchise, this is one game you should not miss playing! 'Hands-on' Dungeon Keeper!
1157	1	a	Both games Renaissance and Ressurection are combined here, plus a few extra maps for good value. Sadly, however, the combat system has been 'tweaked' yet again, and is fiddly and time consuming. Originally it was the simnplicity of the combat system that gave this game its appeal. They honestly did not need to change it. Former fans of Heroes of Might And Magic, who had abandoned that game as it became so childish, flocked to this in preference. Still a game I would recommend, but I'd actually suggest buying the two stand-alone games mentioned above, instead of the combined package here. A classic example of how sometimes change is not for the better.
5084	1	a	Customizable spaceships, outright piracy and mass destruction - with late-game zombies. It is quite entertaining and fun.  It is as challenging as you are willing to grind up - the longer you spend grinding the easier the game gets, the quicker you rush missions the easier it becomes to be outmached. Its quite a fun take on it all in a 2D top-down shooter.  There is any number of ways to build and play, taking a wide variety of options to the gamem but it does ultimetly boil down to a gindfest, but still an enjoyable one.  This definetly is one I'd reccomend.
2730	1	a	The year is 1788.The American Colonies have been liberated from Britain. Trouble brews in the West; the Iroquois are not happy about our Victory. An American army moves in to prevent any attacks on major cities,as well as to make way for an invasion of Kaintuck.  The American army,1966 soldiers strong,assaults the Iroquois' main army,consisting of 1100 troops. After a few minutes of battle the Iroquois are routed,however it is too late; the Americans have encircled them. With nowhere to run,they make one last push to break the American lines.They fought to the last man. In total,the Americans lost 97 men.The Iroquois capital fell shortly after.  A few years later,in 1802,the Americans seek to claim the lands of Kaintuck and Upper Louisiana. Amid failed negotiations with France for Upper Louisiana,the Americans march an army to the borders of Kaintuck to scout it's defenses in preparation of a hostile takeover. They make a shocking discovery; Russia has taken over Kaintuck.  10/10 would destroy the Iroquois Confederacy to clear the way to capture Kaintuck only to have Russia foil the entire plan again. 
3378	1	a	This game is awesome. Get it.
2610	1	a	This game is just unbeleivable. I have never even played an RTS before Civ V;if that counts as one.   But oh my god, I think I may be an RTS nerd now. Its just so fun, and mind-blowing! Having massive battles with countless units and thousands of men, each one destinctly visible, is just AMAZING when you see it. It is addictive, fun, and just overall mind-boggling.   You could even say that it's'whack' or 'off the chain, dawg'. Yeah thats right, I just went there. I could not recommend it enough.
1218	1	a	A pretty plain tower defense that's better suited for maybe a tablet. Still, surprisingly difficult.  6/10  It took me 2.5 years to beat two missions.
849	1	a	This game is incredibly satisfying. The character is hilarious and the traps are really fun to watch as they slaughter millions of orcs. Some later maps get very hard and there is no endless mode.
665	1	a	At the beginning of each level the characters have some lines. On one of the last levels I was rolling. Just a funny â¥â¥â¥ line.   Fun game to play.
3281	1	a	great game...the best of this type
1438	1	a	a great Total War game.  I love this time period and although the naval battles are hard and uninteresting the rest of it is a ton of fun.  
1169	0	a	I think the positive reviews are mostly due to extremely lowered expectations from the previous disciples iii releases. Although improved, still no comparison to the original titles. There are some good points about the game, but in general progression is extremely slow, fights are repetitive and not rewarding (in terms of XP but also artifacts are boring). There is no AI, more or less you fight only against natural groups of monsters.
518	1	a	Very addicting game, well made, good for killing time.
2500	1	a	Buggy, but still fun.
4191	1	a	This is the best Total war game ever! I have enjoyed this game for years and still play it. I wish Total war would go into more eras Including the world wars........
5295	1	a	It's a good game, if you like long-term space top-down shooters.
5309	1	a	I spent several years in the army and I gotta say this game is spot on with the training and atmosphere the military provides. I love how difficult this game is, and I love all of the different features the game provides. It is NOT easy to hit a target with an assault rifle from 300 yards in real life, and this game seems to match that same difficulty. Fatigue is a real thing and it seriously hinders your accuracy in real life...Arma 3 makes you stop and catch your breath if you run too far or carry too much gear, or you will have a hard time hitting your target. Enemies are not stupid and they have great vision. I was engaged by two enemies from about 200 yards away and they were using bushes for cover as well as 3-5 second rushes when moving. The AI is more advanced than the average taliban are in real life. haha :p Given my love for the military and for videogames, this one is definitely one of my favorites of all time :D
230	1	a	Super fun game and all but Orcs Must Die 2 is out so just buy that unless this is mega on sale. Also buying this game will unlock some more levels in omd2. (7/10)
2319	1	a	Totally recommended this game people who like strategy games.One minus is multiplayer he is not so good how he should be.   9/10
3911	1	a	+ three continents, + a lot of nations with many unique units each, + interesting way to develop regions, + technologies, + due to the diversification of unit rooster the battles are played in many different ways, + some units have abilities like planting mines, etc., + multiplayer quick battle place you in the army from the region you are currently living in (fe: if you are Spanish then you get Spain), + amazing naval battles, + hero like units (only one regiment per the entire country). ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ - most of the unique units are provided by DLCs, - useless artilleries, - the game is unplayable without mods (DarthMod!), - despite three continents there are not so many regions to conquer.  It used to be my favourite Total War game until I have discovered Shogun 2. Anyway, the game with DarthMod is one of the best strategy game.
4236	1	a	Goat, American Rev
1369	1	a	You can be a Conqueror&amp;Admiral in here. But the bugs also too many. Maratha Confederation Sweden Empire Ankara are the Graphics Killer.
2240	0	a	Oh boy, a total war game based in the most idiotic era of war... I recommend this game for anyone who enjoys an 'AI' that acts more like an enthusiastic pre-schooler than a seasoned general; baffling empire-wide micromanaging; game-breaking glitches; and just all-around mediocre-ness. At first, I was really excited to play this game. But the fun had just about totally evaporated by the time I had spent a mind-boggling 10 HOURS trying to beat the PROLOGUE. By the time I gave up on that and started the 'Grand Campaign', I just couldn't find the game's brain-dead battle AI and breathtaking glitches appealing anymore. When this game is looked back on 10 years from now, it will be compared with the likes of classics like E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial and Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing. However- there is arguably some fun to be had in free battle. Having masses of hapless enemy soldiers charging into a wall of bullets, etc. - Final Review Score- a sloppy 3.5/10. If you want a Total War game with guns, maybe you should try Fall of the Samurai.
61	1	a	Very fun action/tower defense game. The dialog and animations are funny, the music is catchy, and the gameplay is thrilling. Not like any other TD I have ever played.
4319	1	a	Very fun and great game play
2783	1	a	Finally got around to playing this after buying it couple years ago. At first I was a little skeptical about it; not being very similar to the first Rome Total War and Medieval 2 Total War which I'm a big fan of. I'm going to say it now before giving this a good review that Rome and Medieval 2 Total War are way better compared to Empire Total War and a classic in the series. But now to give Empire T.W. a good review, this is a really good game, took me alot of getting used to compared to the older two Total War's that I admire. Still a few more things I got to learn being at 20hr's played at the time I wrote this review. Pretty addicting, more action involved in the battles, the ship battles give me a headache sometimes but are fun as well. I like the big map compared to the Rome and Medieval 2 Total War, which makes it more interesting! Overall this is a great game, like every Total War game I've played its very well optimized, and makes strategy just fun.
4930	1	a	Enjoyed the Arcade action with strategic elements! The story was not very good and occasionally it was grindy but overall fun for the price.
4936	1	a	Don't people have enough of these long long reviews for simple games? A good and enjoyable game, recomending that you should play this. You will love it, also keep your heads up for SPAZ 2. Looks very good even better so than SPAZ 1.
179	1	a	addictive game!! really awesome arcadish kindo' game graphics but really superb!! While playing the game its intensity and quickness makes me too much impulsive!
1323	1	a	Love the era this is set in, thoroughly enjoyed conquering the new world. Had a troubled launch, but that was years ago, the game as it is now is a must for RTS fans.
5330	1	a	Brilliant Military Sim sandbox. Like simulators? Like Military Shooters? Like Sanbox games that encourage mods and community content?  If yes, you should already own this.
2465	1	a	Ever see tin soldiers? Play with this instead.
731	1	a	Surprisingly fun and captivating, this game will surely keep you entertained for a few hours
3697	1	a	Love this game EVERYONE GET IT AND INSTALL IT â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥!!
1068	1	a	1 time i played i could not stop its like abc mouse if you have seen the comercials they say there child just can not stop and i can not stop so its a great game in all i just got a regular computer and its smoother than jazz.I love this game!!!!!!!  :) :)
5218	1	a	Just buy it
302	1	a	Unique game. Totally worth the money and will suck you in.
1090	1	a	Fun game, tower defense w/FPS twist. I wish it was multiplayer though. Still worth it.
4066	1	a	Best strategy !
1768	1	a	Sad to say but this game isn't that great. Mainly because of the AI, in a game were alliances and diplomacy are so essential, you'd think the AI would be great. Its the complete opposite. Allies won't help at all, city states that are allied to you at the start of the game drag you into wars with super powers you can't possibly win and if you break the alliance you lose ALL your allies, and everyone will hate you and go to war with you. Another thing, navies. Navies are very key to the game (as you can imagine) but sadly its very very hard to build one. You start off with no navy to speak of, while other countries (Spain, France) have many fleets. You can try to build a navy, but before its big enough another nation will come along and destroy it. Finally my last issue is up keep of armies. The game is called Total War for a good reason, you are always at war on multiple fronts (which is annoying as you have to put all your money into war and you can't improve your nation). Which means you will need multiple armies, which is hard at the start because your allies wont help and you will get bankrupt, your troops will leave you and you will get overrun. I have played this game alot (I got the game on a disk before I got it on steam hence the measly two hours on record) and have won world domination on hard difficulty. This game is playable but it will be one miserable ride. However this some moments can be quite good, like when thousands of your cavalry charge down those damn rebels. And when you look over whole continents that belong to you. And when you finally crush filthy France and Spain for constantly hindering your progress. There are good moments and the tears, pain and self harm make it worth it. So maybe you should give it a go. I'm just some kid with too much time on my hands what do I know.  Final Verdict: 7/10
3254	1	a	Can't go wrong with any TW game, this is my favorite of the bunch due to its time period and theme. A must buy!
3779	1	a	gret gamed play it 10/10
3951	1	a	A Very enjoyable world based TBS. Basic to average politics and map based military movements though the highlight is clearly the close up real time tactical battles and good looking battlefields.
4273	1	a	Great game the american campaigns are amazing and though to me atleast the RTS for the sea battle feels a bit wonky the game as a wole is a must have.
2196	0	a	The game itself is a lot of fun; unfortunately I am unable to complete a single campaign without getting to a point where ending the turn crashes the game. Loading previous saves yields the same result. Just can't recommend a game with such fundamental issues. 15+ hours invested into a campaign only to be unable to progress 3 years from victory.
2931	1	a	I really enjoyed and enjoy the game! Even though i had most fun with the 'battles' IÂ´d like to think the campaign was good too! Even though i didnÂ´t play it very much. However i do have one question: Is it possible to play the french revolution (VIVE LA RÃVOLUTION) or is it just a advertisement for the game because it is visible in the trailer/intro cutscene?
4749	1	a	An interesting space shooter with some twists. The customisation is great, the way to unlock new hulls is great, and I can guarantee that once you're past the tutorial missions you'll be spending hours on this baby.
689	1	a	Another great spin on tower defense. You can create elaborate traps - lots of very fun trap types that work well together, each one upgradeable for a small meta game (each trap type can be upgraded once). You can also take on orcs by making yourself more powerful (upgrading spells, damage, etc). And of course, you can do both. The main campaign has 24 levels, which take anywhere from 5-15 minutes each. Took me about 8-10 hrs to complete the campaign. Then if you enjoyed it, there's leaderboards and some DLC that give you reasons to play more.
1545	1	a	Empire Total War is a classic for me. I love the time period it's in and if you like total war games, this is the one you can get.
3733	0	a	This was the first Total War game that I ever played and at the time I got it I loved it. Don't be fooled by my hours. 300 of those was by accident when I left it running. The fighting mechanics are horrible and The Creative Assembly just tried to put too much into one game. It's fun to play, but in reality, the gameplay is poop. P.S. the music is horrible which all know music makes the game.
2982	0	a	CA no longer supports this game, they never fixed what was broken before they stopped supporting this game. do not buy this game.
4675	1	a	Funny, creative, lots of replayability, great customization: One of the best 2D Spacesims I have played!
1128	1	a	ORCS ARE HUGE, THAT MEANS THEY HAVE HUGE GUTS! SPIKES AND TAR, SPIKES AND TAR!
2116	1	a	Best total war game yet
5062	1	a	took me a long time to get tired of playen this game. if u dont mind a bit of plot in the sandbox feel then yea float around a bit here
3385	1	a	the best RTS for RTS lovers!
2780	1	a	I love this game, I could play it all day...if I wasent in college =P
2471	1	a	Excellent and challenging, With a reasonably steep learning curve. Mods out there improve the little areas that you might find lacking, but if you like large scale Turn based strategy games, you'll like this. The Battles also have a real time option, which can be both fun and infuriating, but rarely boring.
3607	0	a	I feel as if my troops wanted to die all of the time and the cannons didn't feel like working during battle I'll stick to my Mid-Evil RTS games.
3449	1	a	Probably the one of the greatest PC strategy games of all time! 
5014	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ I MEAN THIS GAME HAS EVERYTHING YOU EVER NEED IN A GAME. HERES A VERY LENGTHY LIST FOLLOWED BY CHECKMARKS IF THE GAME HAS IT:  1. SPACE [â] 2. PIRATES [â] 3. AND(s) [â] 4. ZOMBIES [â]  THAT RIGHT THERE TELLS YOU WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW. WHY ARE YOU EVEN STILL READING THIS? YOU SHOULD BE IN SPACE BEHAVING LIKE A PIRATE IN ORDER TO KILL ZOMBIES AND ANDS!
5136	1	a	Very simple gameplay, but addicting as â¥â¥â¥â¥. Also nice difficulty later on.
4794	1	a	This game is a lot of fun even though it gets really repetative towards the end. The controls feel good, the upgrades and unlocks feel varied and worthwhile, and can go from really easy to insanely hard. I can recommend this at full price.
4304	1	a	Hours and hours of fun!
3989	1	a	Best Strategy game i have ever Played Beats Command And Coquer And age of empires Combined
3	1	a	So.Very.Fun  There is nothing more to say, this game is amazing fun and I really don't understand why everyone does not play it.
4815	1	a	Great game with a randomly generated universe. This game is worth the money
1009	1	a	Low price but hours of fun. Great game! 3D tower defense category with lot of very original traps and action!
3132	1	a	
1392	1	a	Dang this game is so awesome you should buy it right now!
1400	1	a	This is the game that warmed me up to the Total War series (and Turn-Based games in general). Glad I played it and I will continue to play this series (not just Empire), cant wait for Warhammer!  Great fun and the graphics still hold up pretty well!
4785	1	a	This game is pretty badass. It has the perfect combination of Twitch Skill, Tactical Manuvering, and RPG-like progression. It's horribly addicting to keep cruising around space, hoping the next fight you get into will yield the blueprints you need for a sweet, 6 turret-ed ship to round out your fleet. The story is pretty meh, but I just skimmed most of the dialogue anyway. The background chatter that plays during missions and the billboards floating through space can be downright hilarious though.  Since I got this on sale, my only compaint is that it might make me buy Space Rangers 2...
2548	1	a	This game is absolutley fantastic, as part of the Total War series it is by no means the best... however it is not the best. The games mechanics are okay at best, the main fun from this game comes from the fact that you are able to fight in 3 differnet theatres of war. The ability to start as a european nation such as Sweden or Prussia and have that nation expand to have colonies in America and India is immensly good fun. The line infantry combat is not perfect but is still enjoyable.  Overall i would rate this game at 7/10. It loses points for me due to the fact it feels like CA took on more than they could chew and the line infantry combat is not fully up to scratch for me. It does however game points for me down to the customization options(Naming Regiments) and the freedom to exapand your empire to America and India
3255	1	a	If you are literally Hitler you will enjoy this.
4178	1	a	good game. wont start, goobye steam!
2915	1	a	Play on very hard  gets attacked by everyone in 1 turn now owns 6 cities when you start with 2 they all rebel rebellion gets destroyed rules the world 10/10 would be prussia again
4962	1	a	Imagine Stellar Frontier with better graphics, the ability to move to a new solar system once you've wiped out everybody then add big frakkin' guns and lots of 'splosions!  It's pirates and zombies in space! All it needs is ninjas and this game would be perfect! (I hear that's coming in an update...)
1890	1	a	my first total war game. And definately my favorite! they need to make another empire total war with more land and better ai
1532	1	a	That game don't have the best opinion in Total War fans community, but truth is that was breakout in TW. First part with real border and reinforcments system. Entire region counts due to need to defend/atack factories on it ect. Of course first TW with naval warfare. Battles are really tactic , you need to learn how to use and control your units properly because if you just right click to atack it will coust you. And first time we got almost global map/maps.   Between that is enormous amount of bugs, non realistic things or just stupid things like diplomacy and battle AI. But.. most of it you can solve by instaling proper mods - a lot of them, a lot of reading and work to get your bundle working but when you finish you got realy good strategy. And that is why i'm, recomending Empire. Napoleon is even bettert but lack of mods there and map with few BIG empires for me don't give that gameplay i like.
4532	1	a	One of the best games I've played in the last 3-5 years and for certain a game that sits somewhere in the best twenty games I've played. And honestly, a game that shares one of twenty seats with timeless classics and extremely fine games such as Star Control, Master of Orion, X-COM, Terra Nova and Battlezone (1998) definitely deserves all these/those praises! Plenty of depth to it as well. 10/10
114	1	a	Dunno what to say. If you like tower defence, play it. If you like OTS madness, play it. If you like crude humor with soho accents, play it.
2850	1	a	Just buy on sale, install Darthmod and enjoy. Easy to say that its more value for money that Napoleon is.
3474	1	a	Empire Total War + Darthmod = You no longer have a life
3734	1	a	love this game â¥â¥â¥â¥ing hate steam
15	1	a	Nice take on an FPS tower defense. Worth playing just for the hilarious dialogue alone.
3421	1	a	Bugged vanilla AI, but easily fixable with proper mods. When ran with Darthmod it's easily 9.5 out 10
4934	1	a	A game that combines a Asteroid esque type game. Enjoyable and repetitive. Still I can't recommend it enough, its only missing ninjas!
2115	1	a	how do u stop the lag
366	1	a	Fun TD Game with orc's!
2542	1	a	Extremely interesting and entertaining game, great continuation of the Total War series. High recommended for fans of Rome: Total War, Age of Empires, Hearts of Iron etc.   Plenty of fun, you will get your moneys worth with this title.
3327	1	a	Very fun game! It is all there you got the diplomatic side, the battle side and the trading side of it 9.5/10
1182	0	a	Not a horrible game but there are quite a few better choices out there.
2916	1	a	I removed the P from Prussia. 
4579	1	a	I had to come back to this game and restart it, because I don't think I really understood what was going on the first time I tried it. But if you really understand the systems and how you should progress, this is an excellent game. Fun spaceship dogfights with a vast world to explore, diplomacy to manage, and lots of different ways to progress. Really impressed.
1361	1	a	Still alive and kicking as one of my favorite strategy game of all time. Albeit released in 2009, the game is not as smooth and polished as Napoleon Total War. There are small glitches here and there, but you sort of learn to work around them. Nothing game-breaking.  Unfortunately, Creative Assemblies has yet to optimize the multiplayer experience. So a lot of games may drop, lag, have cheaters who don't follow rules, and just downright noobs who don't know what the'yre doing and there's not much player-side control over it.   However, with its flaws, I still find the multiplayer to be much more balanced and enjoyable than Napoleon Total War. Granted I play native americans most of the time, I find that the factions have many different strengths &amp; weaknesses, and the diversity of playing style and tactics are endless. It's also really fun to â¥â¥â¥â¥ arrogant people off by beating them with mere Axes and Arrows.   I also find the strategy to be much more in-depth than Napoleon. NTW just relies on stretching out lines, artillery barrages, and cavalry charges. In empire you have to be much more selective with how you form and move your infantry on the battlefield and which units to assign to different tasks.   Are the expansions worth it? If you want to play online, definitely as it will keep you in equal balance with other players, although you can still win without them. For single player, not really, as downloading expansions like darthmod will give you tons of interesting added-on units.  I don't have over 1500 hours in this game for nothing. Jump in and play. The learning curve is tough at first, but playing online is a good way to get good fast and blow through enemies both in singleplayer and multiplayer.
4935	1	a	I thought it was going to be another simple score based space shooter.  I was wrong. It's actually quite the little tactical game. Think gratuitous space battles, but with direct control, and off field support for rebuilding and repair.
1648	1	a	This is a really good game. There are lots of glicths and bugs and some stupid mechanics. But the battles are amazing and the campain really good.
40	1	a	A nice little take on the tower defense and the third person shooter genres. The only draw back outside of the weapon DLC being a bit overpriced for what it gives you is that the main charecters limited repitor of speech files can get a bit grating after a few levels. But if you like tower defense games or even Dungeon Defenders but wished it's single player was better you will like this game.
2813	1	a	play a little great game &lt;3 Total war life 
1216	1	a	Really good &amp; fun Tower Defense game..... Enjoying my time playing this game..... Even more addicted than GTA V for sure.  It's been a while since i played this game, recently i just started to play it again and now i remembered why i stopped played it before... how time flies away while play this game.... so much fun to plan your tactics to encounter the incoming enemies.   You got to have strategies to deploy your arsenal under budget given at the start of the round, you received money after killing enemy which you can use to buy more arsenal to play with. Every mission contains about 20 or more rounds and every campaign contains multiple missions.
2607	1	a	If you enjoy your history, you will enjoy this game...
3556	1	a	My Favorite Steam Game
1561	1	a	great installation in the Total War line of games. lots or replay value and great graphics
4278	1	a	If you see my hours you know I've been poking around in this game for a decent while now. I recomend this game because of it's realism and replayability. Even if you take over the whole world you can restart and expect a completly different set of challenges. I hope everyone can have the same amazing, and minutely frustrating time I did with this game. Have fun, and remember never charge a square with calvary.
929	1	a	Good tower defense game.
4241	1	a	this has been a very good game, it supported my 4gb ram laptop and i was able to play it at full speed, the History inside the Campaign has been very good, i like the detail on some of the troops when close zoomed. in other news time to kick butt with the British.
2145	1	a	good game I love the different units I would also recomend Europa Universalis 4
651	1	a	10/10 would kill orc again
1151	1	a	Although this says on the store page it was released on 14 Feb 2014 it has actually been on steam for a long time, it's just that there was no store page for it. It was sold on other online stores with a steam key.  The developers of this game are no more so there will likely be no kind of support. There have been problems running it in the past, see the old steam thread hub:   http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=251   Having said that, it is a good game and I prefer it to Might and Magic: Heroes VI.  Wait for a 75% off sale though- it's a year and 9 months or so old and has been 75% off a fair few times before now.
560	1	a	Who doesnt love killin' orcs? This game is amazing! i really recommend this to all people who like fighting in generally  You will love this game  
5177	1	a	A game that is a bit like Star Control 2, except without that annoying time limit, more ships, more ship upgrades oh and zombies. The game can get pretty hard, especially when you have to deal with zombies, as they can subvert your ships.
2705	1	a	Played as Russia. Ruled the waves, sands, forests, and all of thee above. The AI could have been better though, but...   10/10 would Putin again
5161	1	a	Pretty Good Game.
1447	1	a	Empire Total War is the elite strategy game. It might not have the graphics or the concepts of Rome Total War 2 but it still is loads of fun. I reccomend this game because it is so fun. The maps are beautiful and so is the warfare. And especially the DLC (Downloadable Content) The DLC is so cheap, and is worth it. And this game is so great to me because it was the first one I have ever bought on Steam. These were some reasons on why Empire Total War is a great game to download!
5281	1	a	Really Really awesome! Sucked up 47 hours of my life!
4921	1	a	Score Based  Challenge - A-    Game is intuitive, presents a reasonable difficulty progression, and a excellent learning curve    Starting Tutorial is fun and engaging presenting the necessary information without being boring    Minus a few points for content that wile interesting, where also tedious and overly time consuming.  Game Quality - C    Game is very well designed and provides a fresh and unique feel that sets it apart from other similar games.    Content is fun and varied, supports a large number of play styles and tactics, all retaining use throughout the game    Biggest hit was for low Replayability. after beating the game i just didnât feel any need to keep playing.  Refinement â A    Played the entire game, start to finish, and never once crashed or encountered a noticeable bug     Balance and effectiveness of ship types and equipment scale well with difficulty (altho some ships never get used due to late availability in the game, making some of the contents use questionable)    Developers seam to take an active role in the games player community (very impressive for only a handfull of people)  Presentation â B    Not a graphics intensive game, however what is included is well themed and well implemented    User interface is intuitive and easy to use    Kind of hokey in an odd sort of way. Story line is a little weak, however still fun and interesting enough    Hype was dead on. This game is exactly what it looks like, exactly as advertised, and well worth the play time.  Additional Content â B+    Game supports all manner of Mods and additional content    Developers have released a small number of fun holiday themed mods for community use    Modding utilities have also been released to general community, they are complete and effective they do however require some investment in time, energy, and learning to use correctly     Relatively active player community, including a functional wiki, and several active modding forums.  Fun â C+    Surprisingly Immersive, despite its rather primitive look, engaging and enjoyable    Intensive enough to keep the players attention, however some aspects did become tedious and frustrating.    Wile not in my top 10. It defiantly has several core qualityâs that make it a 'Must Have' for any game collection   Total Grade â Solid 'B+' this is a very good game. A solid experience all the more impressive due to volume of content, and the relatively small development staff. At the time of writing, this the game is priced at $9.99 and it is worth every penny. Will likely get SPAZ 2 when it comes out.
4447	1	a	My all time favourite RTS game, I got this game for christmas in retail version back in 2005 and its the only christmas present I can remember even now in 2015.   I really love and recommend it.
3713	1	a	best total war game ever
1901	1	a	10/10 would make America Great Britain again.
5292	1	a	Blah! This is like...everything I want from Galactic Civilizations, Sins of s Solar Empire, and Smugglers....plus ZOMBEEZ! Epic $15 spent should you like these sort of games. ^_^
807	1	a	An execellent tower defense/strategy game with a little humor. Great graphics, lots of things to built, lots of magic to cast; and lots of maps to test your skills on. Most importantly, it's good fun.
3561	1	a	this game gave me a better idea of what ti was like for my great grandfather when he fought in the korean war. â¥â¥â¥â¥ was brutal, man
4590	1	a	If you loved the space shooter games of yore then this is a dream come true! Customize your own fleet, purchase new tech, ally or betray two factions and prepare for a massive galatic zombie infestion!
2224	1	a	this... is... just... awesome :D
2773	1	a	it is a good game 
105	1	a	Orcs Must Die! is a tower defense game where you are in control of the hero who will be fighting off Orcs and planting traps. The game plays like a 3rd person action game mixed in with the traditional tower defense formula. The player plays an extremely active role and your crossbow will be needed just as much as wall arrow traps. There are numerous traps at your disposal and you unlock more as you go along. By the end of my play through I ended up using just about every single trap. They are all designed very well and most of them work well with each other to produce great kill boxes.  The game features three difficulties but you'll want to start on War Mage as you don't gain many skulls (the currency used to upgrade traps) on Apprentice (the easiest). At the end of each map you are awarded between 1 and 5 skulls based on your performance. Getting 5 skulls will require a significant amount of strategy (especially on Nightmare, although there's no achievement for getting all 5 skulls on all stages on Nightmare, just War Mage). You'll need to pretty much know what is going to come out and during what wave so that you can prepare adequately. YouTube is an excellent reference if you're having trouble and is great for learning new strategies that you may not have figured out on your own.  There's not much more to the game outside of the general story mode but getting all 5 skulls on War Mage and Nightmare will take a while, making the game a great value considering it's already quite cheap. The game features leader boards so you can always go back one you've fully upgraded your traps and go for a better score on the global rankings or among your friends. Overall this is a great tower defense game that is well worth your time if you have any love for the genre.   8/10
3593	0	a	Really â¥â¥â¥â¥, Don't buy, Worst game I have Ever Played!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2169	0	a	'Units can you please shoot the native americans scalping you from the flank? Maybe stab them or something? No?' And then I lost
4738	1	a	Fun simple space game. Control 2-4 ships of different sizes which you can customize a little (i.e. choose weapons and features according to specific spots). Each system basically has an oppressive government group and rebellious civilian group. Theyâre relationship with you depends on the system and your actions. You may enter one system where the government loves you and the civilians hate you, then move into the next system where the gov. hates you and the civies love you, then the next system they both love you. You actions in one system does not affect the others. The missions in each system will affect your relationships in that system so be careful. Unique game, fun to play.   Pros - Each game is randomly generated so your experiences will always be different. - Simple to learn/play  Cons - The story doesnât necessarily enthrall you but its there.  
3366	1	a	Excellent game, though it isn't the best in the series.
346	1	a	Great game, fun if you want to waste some time or blow some steam. Not serious at all, and tons of fun.
3040	1	a	I love this game :)
4703	1	a	Got this in a bundle -  https://www.humblebundle.com/weekly  for less than a dollar. Best money I ever spent!  It's a fun 2D space tactics/shooter,. lots of missions,. no really LOTS,. the map is pretty huge. Customization options, achievements, the list goes on.  Pretty good, worth getting.
206	1	a	The polish on this game is uncanny. The art is fantastic, the gameplay is loads of fun, and there's excellent balance between the tower defense style play and the hack 'n slash aspect. You can't be good at just one, and you really need to use them together. Story is amusing too. Love the juvenile humor.
1760	1	a	its really good but if you play it to long you get bord of it
1069	1	a	Awesome and fun game! Killing orcs is simply amazing!
3581	1	a	In my Shogun 2 rccommendation, I called this game a failure. I was wrong, what made it a failure in my eyes that I didn't really see at the time was a sucky computer that held the game back.  Now I play it quite regularly, heavily modded with Darthmod. But I did play it unmodded for a long time, and even by itself, it shines.  I love this period in general, and it's combat, the game makes a very good job of pulling it off too. Musket fire, cannon volley's, the smoke filling the air. It can be amazing to watch as your line infantry gun down an approaching melee troop with fire by rank. The diplomacy system in it is also one of the more involved, and on the higher difficulties, the AI is deffinately more competant and demands less stupid things.  Although, despite my beasty machine that I run now, Empire still tanks sometimes on siege battles, apart from that, it runs really smooth, and stable, even when heavily modded.  After more consideration, i'd highly recommend giving this Total War game a try.
4509	1	a	+fine space shooter with some fleet management +nice sound and visuals  -ui isnt scaling with resolution, forcing you to play in some low res matching your screen ratio -quite grindy and repetitive after a while
2826	1	a	i love this game i just wihish the siege battles did not studder my game other then that it is funn as heck i love the scope of this total war and the time peroid also its just fun 9/10
4356	1	a	13.5/20
1185	0	a	Okay, if youâre going to transform the game into Heroes Of Might and Magic, try at least not to make same mistakes. Though, Disciples is NO Heroes, it will never be Heroes nor it needs to be. The 2D and Pseudo 3D aspects of Disciples II, I loved every bit of it so Fâ¦ck very much for ruining it.  I donât like the artwork, also the interactive objects in the game world are hardly identifiable, yes it takes some getting used to however the game lost all the Disciples appeal that attracted me in the first place.  To stupid devs - more textures and fancy 3D does not necessarily mean a better game, itâs time for you to learn that.
1835	1	a	meeh it's fine
791	1	a	Have you noticed how Tower Defense has become like FPS used to be? A new one launches every week. This game sets itself out from the pack by having you play over the shoulder or first person. Good amount of comedy. Nice graphics. You get to kill, maime, and roast Orcs. What isn't there to like?
2679	1	a	Little late for a review, but I think it's time to put this game rightfully in the place of every person who calls themself a 'strategy gamer's' shelf. Excellent gameplay, of which can be increased tenfold by great mods such as Darthmod and such, absolutely one of the prettiest games I've played. If you like strategy, this game will take up a good 100+ hours of your life.
2350	1	a	I really enjoyed it! It's a new engine compared to previous total War games, however I believe it works good but just short of great. I have spent many nights comquering Europe, and I and truly enjoyed kicking@ss throughout the continent! &gt;:)  If you're into strategy, seeing huge battles, and managing an empire, then this is your game. As of it's $10 price right now, it's a must have.   Enjoy the power!
903	1	a	Orcs Must Die has, for me, devolved into a 'Must get and retain high score Vs my friends'.... still gotta get that for the first map...  As a fan of both FPS and TD, I very much enjoy this hybrid. Thanks to Kruel Handlebar for introducing me to this....
2057	1	a	Ruled fron America to Middle East, from South Africa to Persia, the only remaining nations are me and Mughals. Mughals have only India, I have the god damn world, I had lost the war.   9/10 would kick your bottocks on multiplayer cuz I have dlc units.
1105	1	a	This game is vomiting painful but enjoyable
4969	1	a	very fun, and some of the mods acctually work.
4727	1	a	A whole lot of fun
285	0	a	Why continue to propagation of the wide misconception in our society that orcs are intrinsically evil and therefore must be slain. It is this kind of hatred propaganda that we need to have removed from our society and place out of reach of the impressionable minds of our youth.
1795	1	a	Really great game! It includes all the powerful empires from the 1700-1800 era
2546	1	a	This is the first total war series that I play   This game make me love total war series   I still remember when attacking enemy ships, stormed the enemy soldiers, enemy castle, and destroy nation   and this is total war  with many countries in the world  and tens of thousands of troops in one map  total war is total war  p.s. the only problem is this game makes my pc's hot
2167	0	a	This game has potential but has so many problems that I can not recommend it. It is mared with freezing and slowdowns, but the random crashes make it unplayable. Do not give these Aholes your money.
215	1	a	A highly addictive 3D tower defense game that simply feels right; the game is just long enough, the trap and enemy variety feel diverse without feeling bloated, and the pacing feels perfect too.
2867	1	a	love this game 10/10
1697	1	a	Yeah, get it if its cheap. Decent Game.
3083	1	a	It's a Total War game. Best will in the world it's more of the same: units and strategic maps may change but the basic controls and overall experience don't. If you have never played a Total War game but you love both real time and turn based strategy then buy this game now (or one of it's siblings), you have no idea what you've been missing all these years. If you have played a Total War game before then you know exactly what you're getting.
1388	1	a	Naval battles are the best part of this game!
3308	1	a	tis the awesome of the sauces
885	1	a	Nice, mindless fun. In the game you play as a war mage that kills orcs. You get cool traps and a few weapons. It's quite satisfying to play too. Only downside is lack of multiplayer, which is present in the second installment - Orcs Must Die! 2. If this game is on sale, I reccoment getting it. Also, getting this game will grant you 10 extra co-op levels in OMD2, however you have to note that both players need this game for them to be playable in the co-op mode.
111	1	a	I wanted to give this game a legitimate chance before I wrote my review. I am an avid tower defense gamer; there is just something undeniably satisfying about stoping someone from reaching their goal.... its actually kind of sick really. This brings an intresting change of pace. The humor is pretty engaging, I find myself eager with each new level to hear what kind of quip the War Mage will say. The traps are creative and encourage you to find new ways to supress the Orcs. Will your bombard them with Archers while they are arduously walking through a tar pit, or perhaps you would like to take them on yourself while cattle them into a grinder. Whatever menacingly creative way you wish to protect the rift, this game has something for you.  Play it if : You love tower defense (I assure you, you won't be dissapointed) Avoid it if: You are an Orc Lover, You are not creative, or obviously if you don't like tower defense   9/10 in my book The only thing holding it back is no mutiplayer, but the second game remedied that issue
729	1	a	Very Fun 3rd Person Tower Defense!  Tony Seal of Approval
4397	1	a	Played this a couple of years ago closer to release didn't like it and quickly gave up. Then i gave it another chance like two years ago and man has it grown on me. Best sea battles and world map of any total war game, only thing i didn't like was all the land units for every nation are much the same which can get very boring in a long campagin. Everything else i can think of like diplomacy and economy etc very solid.
5146	1	a	Probably the best indy game I've played. Awesome space combat, huge star maps to explore. Research system, leveling your ships, etc. This is a must have.
4285	1	a	Still fun after all this time
1316	1	a	I played it a little bit, it was ok.
2190	0	a	Excellent gameplay however the game is full of bugs like unresponsive units, units retreating the running forward before they attack, changing formation etc. Even with mods this persists would not recommend this game to anyone.
3614	1	a	the game is very fun and sometimes challenging, I recommend it
5126	1	a	A nice blend of arcade and strategy with loads of stuff to discover. Also it reminds Spore with Galaxy Map and the goal to get-to-the-center.
74	1	a	Ultimate time-eater. Probably even better then Plants vs. Zombies in this aspect. Get it and you won't regret it.
855	1	a	Hate Orcs? and want to kill them with traps and spells...then this game is for you!
3875	1	a	this game is very adticting i think you should try it! it is awsome!
3504	1	a	Old But Gold!
3035	1	a	Started off as The U.S. at first we was thought of as poor Colonies then bam i own the whole freakin world! (Except Russia you cant take that giant snow globe)
5178	1	a	Just got this game over the xmas sale. I've really impressed with it! Great fun, a bit of a challenge, and it'll offer hours of good fun.
1664	1	a	You cant be denmark. But you can be sweden?   Disapointed..  Anyway 10/10 :D
222	1	a	Okay, so how come it starts off easy, then suddenly a few levels in, BLAM, I can't get through it?? All the previous levels took me one go, then I get hit by a level I cannot pass. I am NOT going to YouTube for a solution. That is dumb. That is for Candy Crush Saga. Frustrating, and I should blame myself. But I won't, I blame the developers. Anyway, if you like tower defense games, this is one. But up close in 3D.
1688	1	a	The â¥â¥â¥â¥ing sickest strategy game ever. Got both turn based and real time. RT battles are â¥â¥â¥â¥n amazing to watch and play out.
4943	1	a	Play this bloody game, it's awesome!
3532	1	a	Be sure to get Darthmod to enhance tha game. But even without its a great game
2088	1	a	This is my favorite game by far!
2244	0	a	Crashes to Desktop too much and there is no solutino online and when you contact SEGA they will not respond. Terrible Product and terrible customer service
3726	1	a	I love the total war series. This has been the best for me. But it will not open a second time. I have windows 8. Can someone help me out?
4477	1	a	While singleplayer is pretty boring, AoE III is one of the most fun RTS games in multiplayer. Factions play differently, some feel like totally different game, but at the same time they are well balanced. This also forces use of different tactics against different kinds of enemies. There is an abundance of units and buildings, and the game is fast-paced. The graphics are amazing even today, AoE III is one of the best looking RTS games I've seen. The multiplayer is well alive even today, after so many years. I definitely recommend getting this game for every RTS fan. The only thing is that you shouldn't expect a game similar to AoE or AoE II as AoE III is a different game, however, even better in multiplayer in every way. 
2139	1	a	Great game
279	0	a	Bad game. Not worth any money.
3935	1	a	Game is very good, and so realistic. I brough somehwere around 2-3 thousand swedish infantry into the Colonies in the americans and slaughtered the indians, just like it happened all those years ago
589	1	a	Pure Simple FUN! Can't miss with this one!
3089	1	a	Extremely good game, in every aspect. Multiplayer is amazing, especially with friends. The grand campaign is also extremely fun, as it is in any total war game. Overall great game and you all should pick it up. 5/5
4640	1	a	Solid 40 hours of gameplay for an indie space opera style game; fun to play and build up a fleet, worth getting as a 'pick up and play' game for an hour or two at a time.
3180	1	a	I really love this game but the constant crashes let it down I really hope the makers fix this
3685	1	a	The only problem with the game is that it does not have every single continent. Otherwise a very good strategy game.
123	1	a	Great game.
759	1	a	If you hate orcs, this is the game for you
2014	1	a	A great game for anyone who likes history
958	1	a	It's a fairly simple game with a fairly simple concept, but it's fun as â¥â¥â¥â¥. You play as a mage killing orcs in numerous tower defense styled maps, that's it. I give this game a 3/5.
2758	1	a	I love this game, Brilliant Graphics and sound
3004	1	a	â¢ Starts as Sweeden â¢ Russia, Denmark, Great Britain, Prussia, destroyed by 1766 â¢Invents Volvo, IKEA , and Zltan IbrahimoviÄ â¢ everyone tries to invent Zlatan â¢ Me: Fools the is only one Zlatan  R8 421/2 M8. G8 Game
4744	1	a	One hell of a game!!!
2837	1	a	it was too hard for me but it is a great game
2248	0	a	Ottoman Empire's turn took over my computer for 30mins plus it is one of the worst total war games. This game is old and it sucks.
148	1	a	Must orcs die!? And why is the death of ogres and gnolls a foregone conclusion of this? The title's inherent racism is not really questioned at any point. The only option towards a peaceful resolution is to buy drugs that become available late in the game and which you can never afford enough of to avoid bloodshed anyway. The player character is a smug, chauvinistic jock who relishes in the slaugher of people of different skin tones. Utterly disgusting. Servicable gameplay though if you can look past the developer's obviously politically inspired agenda behind this game.
5269	1	a	Literally cheap as chips and you will enjoy it longer.
5229	1	a	good if you like space/shooter games,the zombies arent too easy to spot but in the later levels you get them all the time.
3919	1	a	Many hours of fun with this game and a varied choice of nations to be bringing up new challenges to tackle :)
3362	1	a	A game for smart people who want to command whole armies rather than take potshots in free for all. Wish I knew some.
986	1	a	Seriously the BEST TOWER DEFENCE game out there. A whole lot of fun.
1174	1	a	A completely overhauled Disciples 3. Too bad this game wasn't launched in this final state, it would would've undoubtedly gotten a way better reception than it did. It's estethically drop dead beautiful, the mechanics are mostly sound and it's LONG.  The change from a simple Disciples 2 combat to a full-blown 3D HOMAM-style arena is controversial. In the original game the arena was way too big, the fights too long as a result and the whole game felt like a grindfest. Now the arena is significantly smaller and the fights are snappier. But a whiff of grind is still there.  An issue that bothered me more was the economy. You simply have way too much money in this game. It's not uncommon to have 30k-40k gold from mid-game which makes levelling up units trivial. You simply buy a rookie unit, go to a Training Camp, sink several grand in and voila, you got yourself an elite. It's like Diablo 3 auction house all over again. Maybe the devs wanted to make up for the fact that units level up quite slow on their own but they should've lower the XP requirements instead.  All in all though if you love D2 this version of D3 is probably gona be your cup of tea too. Definitely a very good HOMAM-like game and a very good value too.
2997	1	a	very fun for any stratagy fan who likes a challenge
4937	1	a	Definitely unique, the art is nothing to write home about but blasting through blockade after blockade is fun. For the first handful of times anyway. There is a perpetual grind in this game that really, REALLY grates after twelve hours.  It is fun! For a while. Looking past that, it is a good title I recommend. The gameplay and combat is sound with a wide variety of ships and a steady, worthwhile progression system. Oh and the story is top-notch, because it doesn't take itself seriously. Puns, jokes, and general asshattery abound.  If you plan on buying it, try the demo first, wait for it on sale, and maybe look out for the sequel.
5284	1	a	This is one of those games that just keeps you coming back for more! There are lots of ways to customize and a cheesy but fun storyline. I had a lot of fun playing this and getting all of the achievements.   All in all, zombies, space and lasers are a good combination!
549	1	a	Orcs Must Die embellishes your devious side, encouraging you to devise clever ways of fulfilling the command of the title. For the not-so-clever, mowing down invaders with an automatic crossbow is also a great time. Whatever your approach, an orc's pain is your gain. You must download, because Orcs Must Die.
1079	1	a	Buy this, for ze Toxo recommends slaying of orcs with traps and spells.
26	1	a	You know from the developer said about Orcs Must Die:  Slice them Burn them Chop them Pound them Freeze them  You can use any methods to kill Orcs in this game, simple concepts but varies of executions. Your war mage is become like one man army, dealing with thousands of orcs every time you play this.  You got traps, guardian, spells and weavers to help you killing the orcs, you'll never regret it how things works out if you play this.   This is a hybrid of 3rd person shooter and Real Time Strategy (RTS) because you need to know what kind of trap that will make orcs unable to enter your rift and don't forget of Big Boys such as Ogres and Bat for the Air units.
2572	1	a	Is really fun but takes a while to Install 
974	1	a	Funny game Must buy on sale
4122	1	a	Prussia Strong
737	1	a	Awsm Game!
2746	1	a	I played as the Swedish faction I crushed Denmark became best of friends with the ottomans  and I conquered all of Russia by the year 1733  Central Europe laid bare between the pincers of my giant Swedish meat claw.   10/10
716	1	a	Overall I did enjoy Orcs during the short time I spent with it, and it is a great game. However, it generally didn't stand out of the pack for me, and came at the end of a long winded era of tower defense games.
3982	1	a	Absolutely stunning visuals, epic battles and fluid satisfying combat. If you have a good enough system you'll love it.
1306	1	a	&gt;Prussia conquered Europe  &gt;I was a king of Prussia &gt;I was a tyrant &gt;People wanted democracy &gt;I sparked a revolution  &gt;I sided with rebels &gt;I overthrew my ex-government &gt;Now I'm a dictator &gt;Now Prussia has true 'DEMOCRACY'.   11/10 would democratize again
2734	1	a	Fantastic game that doesn't require an awesome computer to play. Has kept me up countless nights, hell bent on taking the known world as my own. It has a campaign map similar to Civilization with amazingly epic live action battles.
3850	1	a	A Brilliant strategy game. 5/5
2532	1	a	A decent game with many flaws. Install a overhaul mod to get past some of the flaws and bear with the rest. You'll find yourself with hours of fun.
4459	1	a	My Favorite RTS Game, Great Story and Gameplay, WORTH the purchase!
4248	1	a	the only thing i hate more than the medieval age is the gunpowder age. this game was hard and when your troops and cannons shoot dirrectly into a hill and you have to reposition them its very annoying and sea battles are not that great ether. BUT for the same reasons i dont like this game i do like it. From going to the older total wars too this it mad me feel like a real general comming into a new age and having to learn the art of battle all over again. i prefer the clash of steel but this game is good. i would say its a 3.5 out of 5. the warpath campaign is the best tho. native americans were the easiest and funniest to play the game. SUGGESTION start making different color line of sites for if your line of fire is blocked by something at all. so i dont have to zoom in on evrything all the time when setting up.
3667	0	a	crap, this game is crap. I am so bored after 6 hours of playing this stupid game over a 3 week period. I had high hopes for this games because of the amazing setting. It had so much potential yet the developers ruined it and created a anti-fun mess of a game that they threw together to make a few bucks.
4406	1	a	Although sometimes buggy, it's still a great TW game. The fact that you can play in America, Europe, India, Noth Africa and the Middle East might seem overwhelming at first, but you'll soon be immersed into the action. My 2nd favourite TW game, after Rome 1. I'd give Empre a solid 1763/1776.
2582	1	a	Asolutely love this game. Endless replay value, while picking up a fair amount of historical facts as well.
702	1	a	Not quite tower defense, not quite action game, but it is definitely awesome. It's fast-paced, quite replayable, very humorous, pretty challenging. Music's pretty cool as well. I love this game to pieces... with traps.
3400	1	a	I assumed this time period wouldn't be as fun to play as say Medieval or Shogun, but oddly enough watching the plumes of clouds drift from your lines of infantry simultaneously watching the enemy lines fall is uniquely satisfying. If the 80 hours of time I've spent on the game isn't a good enough indication this game will give you hours and hours of enjoyment!
79	1	a	Get this game. Kill orcs. Have fun. Get extra maps for the sequel.
2097	1	a	where do i go to watch replays of your battles does anyone know?
3870	1	a	
3805	1	a	did british vs americans. I made my british forces make a defenceive line and hold their positions as the americans charged towars me. I destroyed them without moving my men forwards. GG
410	1	a	I absolutely love this game! It clearly did not have a huge budget. There are no super expensive intros and the graphics are rather simple (but effective and not bad in any way). But it is the concept that is so much fun. Building traps for the Orcs to run into and get killed in the most hillarious of ways is incredibly satisfying. The dialogue and voice acting are well done. The music fits the theme (but is a bit repetitive). The animation is great. The story is funny. The hero is likeable. My only critique would be that it is a bit short if you paid the full price. It feels like the game only just started when it is already over. You really want to make use of the last few types of traps more often before the game ends. And I never really got to ues the Weavers that much either (there never really is that much money). I wished there had been more levels to explore this upgrade mechanic and the last few traps a bit more.  Because of its shortness, best wait until it is on sale.  8 out of 10
2212	1	a	Turtle approved.
4752	1	a	This is a ton of fun!!! Try the demo. I fell in love with it. Reminds me of FreeSpace in a 2d kind of way. Open gameplay and lots of stuff to do. Along with a fairly interesting story. Looks great and is smooth on my PC as well. Highly impressed.
3234	1	a	its a very fun game especially playing as the ottomans and the battles are nice to watch
4700	1	a	If you miss the old flash game 'Starfighter: Disputed Galaxy' you will love this game.
68	1	a	Is good game. Play very well orc kills. Recommended in holiday children times.
3388	1	a	This is an extremely fun game! When it comes to playing on the battlefield, tactics are a good balance and doesn't become too difficult. The campagin has a nice flow to it and not too confusing overall. Little bit of micro-managaing but it's not too much of a problem. Overall I give this game a 8.5/10
2800	1	a	This game is really awesome! It derserves a sequel! I really like playing as Great Britain in the Grand Campiagn.
4009	1	a	Great game it has crash every moment! 10/10
3162	1	a	My personal favorite strategy game, period, end of discussion!
4993	1	a	It's a decent action-RPG 2d space shooter type thing, let down a bit by repitiveness, grinding as you get later into it, having up to 3 ships at once but 2 of them are inconsiquencially small and the AI controling them isn't great. Still fun and got a sizable update a while ago I still have't checked out.
4254	1	a	Excellent blend of RTS and TBS, would recommend to any fan of the total war series of games.
3975	1	a	Probably one of the better of the Total War games. AI definitely seems to be smarter and more technical than before. It actually tries to flank or out maneuver your troops like a true opponent. Sometimes it seems that it's reading your moves and making the best possible counter to seize your plans and thrash them to uselessness.
2964	1	a	The most AWESOME game EVER. It's Legen... Wait for it.... DARY, LEGENDARY
2207	1	a	Just install DarthMod and you will be A-Okay! :D Seriously it fixes the whole game... :D
3077	1	a	This was the first Total War game that I ever played, and this was my first Steam and PC/Strategy game I've ever played. This is by far along side Shogun 2 and Medieval 2, my personal and most favorite game ever! I've been playing this since 2014 and I've never stopped playing it since, sure I only put in 711 hours into it, but that's because I played others so I don't end up burning out of this game. Yes there is problems with the game (What total war doesn't?) The Naval Combat isn't the best, AI combat or diplomacy is an issue or acts dumb or wired. But I've had far more better experience playing, fighting, expanding, and a bit of roleplay in my mind. If your planning on getting this, or hesitant on buying it. Trust me, you'll have a blast playing this, especially with mods makes this even more better and additive. If your planning on getting this or Napoleon, get Empire first, more nation's, more areas to conquer, and much more units to choose out of. Sure the alot of units are the same and fight the same except a decent handful depending on the nation you play as. But you'll end up playing so much and lose track of time as you March an army of 3000 vs an army of 4000 and watch as your men and enemy slaughter each other in a tense or losing battle making think on which tactic fits you best and watch as your favorite Line Infantry, and renaming it too, and watch them either cut down the toughest of battles, or watch them rout and being cut down. You'll have fun, I'll guarantee it! And the mods for this is just perfect if you're looking to expand on the experince.
5238	1	a	This game is way addictive, I remember playing it at my cabin when I didn't have any internet, and it kept me entertained for 27 hours. Unfortunately, because I was offline it never saved my play time (game saved just fine though), but I would definitely recommend this game. easily an 8.5/10
744	1	a	Alright, I gotta admit, there's a perverse sort of classic Tom &amp; Jerry fun to be had with this game and I have had quite a bit of that fun with this game. Not the best 'action tower defense' game mind (it's dying for a co-op mode), but it's twists in the formula are lotsa fun.
2863	1	a	Best combination of strategy, battles and micro-management i've ever seen. Plus I just love to conquer folk.
5304	1	a	Great game, brings me back to old school arcade ship shooters. That and TI calc games.
4771	1	a	Trully awesome! :D
3392	1	a	Take over the world.
1405	1	a	I probably should have recommended and reviewed this game a long time ago... Apart from Civ 3 or Dark Riegn, both of which I played back in the early 2000's, Empire: Total War has been my most played game strategy game and one of my most played games of all time. I love the real time battles in the Total War games. I recomment Empire to anyone that likes strategy games or has played any of the other Total War games. I even like it more than Rome II that just came out before my writing of this review.
1371	1	a	When i Play this game i feel im like in The Patriot Movie ! XD  Better than Rome TW 2 but even if there are some bugs or other things u can just download The' Dartmode' &lt;3 
555	1	a	This is just dirty, â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ed fun. Gotta think, gotta react, and most of all - gotta stay calm. Definitely worth the lucre.
2186	1	a	why no mods? cage bunny ANGRY....
1368	1	a	In my humble opinion, this is one of the most enjoyable Total War Games today. Sure, it has the typical Total War shortcomings (AI, Diplomacy) but i have not encountered land- and above else seabattles i enjoyed more as in this game. Additionaly the setting is 'fresh'  If you want to conquer the world then i can only recommend this game 
2579	1	a	The epicness of seeing the cannonballs fly into the ranks of your enemies is just spectacular. Even just a handful of volleys from my line infantry can change the outcome of a battle and i especially love crashing into the enemies with my elephants when i use the Maratha Confederacy! the only 2 things i don't like about this game is that the cities are more like forts and the doors on them are terrible, my guys were stuck on the door for half the battle.
1569	1	a	Empire Total War is the best Total War game out there. In Shogun 2 and Rome 2 sure the graphics are better, but there is only one map in those games. In Empire there are three campaign maps in one. America, Europe and India. It is also good because there are a lot of diverse nations to play as. I was able to conquer the world twice, that shows how much I love this game.
2129	1	a	One of the best games you get to create your own battle! You get to be kinda like a general in this game! you like history get this game
2604	1	a	This game is really fun, I've blown a lot of time in Empire. There's really nothing like having muskets and lines of infantry! However, be warned that this game still isn't as good as Shogun 2- especially with the DLC. But, it's still a fun game none the less.
1384	1	a	The Campaign can make your head explode, especially if you're an Empire such as Great Britain that has settlements in America and interests in places such as India.   (I couldn't care less if my vassal is getting attacked, it will take a million turns to get there to help!!!)  YOU'RE IN IT FOR THE LONG HAUL.   The battles are good, I prefer to kill unarmed units with a line of musketmen and the Road to Independence mode allows you to do just that.   Worth a play.
1845	1	a	Like it or hate it, comparing it to other Total War games won't cut it. In the grand scheme of things, Empire is still one of the cream of the crop in strategy. Although sometimes the AI is wonky and graphics and bugs are issues, there is still the noteworthy Total War franchise gameplay we know and cherish combined with one of the richest and most 'civilized' violent eras in human history. The way that Empire let's you play is no longer a jumble of bodies running over each other, it's a skillful game of chess. Much like the time period, the rules of war are clearer and more strategic. This may not be the best Total War game, yet it still ranks high on my strategy list. 9/10
3059	1	a	still holds up great graphically and gameplay wise. now is actually the best time to play it with a modern i7 and decent sized SSD. it struggled lots on older hardware and crash, especially as your empire grew. now you can take over the whole world and it's fine.
3824	1	a	Best with Darth Mod. Now thinking about buying Napoleon too, should i or no?
2322	1	a	one of the best games ever made.
2574	1	a	Ok I should start by saying I actually love the total war series that I have played so far albeit that only includes Shogun 2 and now Empire for me, of which my friends who are into this genre tell me are the best of the total war franchise so far. I have only played 3-4 hours so far so this is more of a first look.  Empire for the sale price was in my opinion a damn good buy, It defiantly adds plus points for value, Iâm not sure I would have been happy if I paid full price for this when it first came out though. There are a few bugs and glitches that do make for a laugh but honestly after this long I would have expected them patched out.  Some bugs I have encountered so far include my troops refusing to stand down or hold a line, and this really annoying one where when you try to move groups of troops at the same time some will just walk off into the void, the target line for their positioning is nowhere near where you clicked and often in a completely opposite direction, meaning you have to micromanage your troops when you shouldnât have to, it kinds of breaks the fun of commanding an army when you have to look at each person and tell themâ¦hey you go there, you over there, you follow him etc.   This game is heavy on forward planning and strategy, it is important to move your troops into strong positions and either advance on the enemy or wait for them to come to you. There is also the world map from which makes different style of play, this is fun as you can engage in diplomacy and lay siege to forts rather than have to play each battle if you donât want to (though you can engage each one if you choose).   The ship combat is fun and has lots of different weapons and tactics to employ in order to gain the advantage, although the path route problem sometimes rears its ugly head again so you end up micromanaging each ship, and even then you have to keep an eye on it to make sure it is doing what you want.   The setting is in the colony era for America and I have to say always one of the more interesting historical periods, there is a lot of lore about all different unit types, the battles themselves and the ships of which I have a good interest.  If you are into strategy, or history or both then this will probably interest you, I would pick it up on sale though as paying more than Â£10 for this would be a mistake in my opinion.   Iâll definably be taking more of a look into this and may update this once I have tried the grand campaign out.  
3058	1	a	Awesome game! Play it!
5235	1	a	Space Pirates and Zombies is a neat little top-down 2D space game. The premises are simple - blow up spacecraft, steal their blueprints (black boxes,) and collect some rocks ('Rez') and other people in space so you can replace your own ships that get blown up.  The game itself has plenty of content, but it's served up cut and dry - and depending on how you generate your galaxies, it can turn into a horrible, horrible grind for resources. If you're bored, rack up some bounty with the bounty hunters, then warp between a bunch of systems under their control. You'll have a bit of extra fun fighting them, simply because they tend to be reasonably stronger than the average cannon fodder provided at that time in the game.  Combat is well-designed, with many facets to it. Continuously firing your weapons and holding down your engines while your shield's trying to recharge is a great way to empty out your power supply, leaving you defenseless. Armor and 'Rez' have weight to them - need extra speed? Dump that 'Rez' you're holding onto. Need to go even faster? Jettison your armor. Certain weapons will deal more damage to a component - lasers will tear shields apart, cannons rip armor to shreds, and missiles deal the most hull damage. Certain odd weapons will deal more damage to different sources for some variety. If you feel daring, ditch your shield for a cloak - while it provides superficial protection, you'll get extra cannon and laser damage while cloaked. Don't rely on your allied spacecraft to be useful for anything other than taking weapons fire, as their intelligence goes as far as 'fly straight at them and turn tail when I'm about to explode.'  Ships can mount a variety of different equipment, but once you understand where everything needs to go, it ends up being that you run Tugs and Grinders for most of the mid-game simply because of how versatile their multitudes of mounts and rotating mount points are, while most other designs become moot. Some equipment seems to become relatively useless simply because of their implementations, while others are so dangerous to everyone that it requires a degree of skill to use. However, this all depends on how you spec your skills.  With that being said, SPAZ can be run on some pretty horrible computers. I've been able to play it at a consistent 60fps on a craptop with only a Celeron 900. If you're going somewhere without Internet or simply just need to burn time, SPAZ is there.    Hits:  - Very lightweight game - Decently in-depth combat mechanics, such as armor and resources weighing your craft down (And jettisoning them makes your craft faster) - Great time sink - Some characters are quirky enough to be mildly rememberable   Misses:  - Quickly becomes grindy - Soundtrack wafts between good and bad - Idiotic AI tends to get itself killed quite often,   especially when the zombies show up      TL;DR   SPAZ is a good game to pick up if you're on a budget and need a game to burn time with. Its low hardware requirements mean that you can plonk it on just about any given computer and it'll run like a scalded ape. Combat is fun and is actually one of the deepest pieces of the game. There's a variety of weapons and ship designs for you to experiment with and perfect. However, grinding and a lack of content means that a second playthrough is generally only done when you have nothing better to do.   Score:  7/10
3948	0	a	slightly less enjoyable than gonorrhea
2577	1	a	GREAT GAME! could be made better with mods tho
4485	1	a	For a uncomplicated repetitive game its extremely addictive, maybe thats where simple beauty lies in this game. The atmosphere to the game is great, the graphics look really colorful, the combat is frantic and fun and the universe you explore is massive. Plus you get to unlock tons of cool stuff to have a laugh with.
4385	1	a	*Starts the American Independence Campaign* First battle with George Washington in 1750's I destroy the enemy force but they have one cannon unit left. I charge everyone head on at cannon unit, cannon manages to fire once. Cannon ball directly hits George Washington killing him 20 years before American revolution. 10/10 would destroy Americas hopes before revolution again.
590	1	a	Great tower defense, but it may get repetitive.  Rating: âââââ 
2845	1	a	take over the world and enforce high taxes on the populas for pure pleasure
418	1	a	Castle defense for the sole sake of Orc bashing fun. It's entertaining.
2541	1	a	Re-doing this reccomendation after 32 hours with the game. It's tons of fun, even if the battles are a bit slow, the overall feel of everything is fantastic, and the feel of the ship battles is spot on. A bit slow on my computer, I still enjoy the grand campaign.
2664	1	a	ONE OF THE BEST RTS 2010 GAME AROUND
1146	1	a	Robot Entertainment have produced a slick action game here based around the popular tower defence genre. This game follows the traditional tower defence script of building traps to stop a constant stream of enemy foe but introduces player spells and weapons to assist. Far from becoming confused the game merges the 2 styles effortlessly, there are occasions when building an intricate series of diversions and traps is the order of the day and other times when equipping your poking stick and some fire gauntlets is required to smite the raging hordes. The game follows a steady learning curve, those new to tower defense games will be handheld throughout the first stages and with the game introducing new skills and abilities as you go along you will never feel overwhelmed at the pace. The games real charm rests in the war mage himself, the character story is developed via cut scenes between levels, he's equipped with a few witty one liners that he will dole out at various times and you cant help but like the guy! The graphics are good, the music is solid and atmospheric . Some people will play through it once but with the introduction of the 'skull ranking' system many will replay the levels in order to 5 skull them. In this game skulls mean upgrades and upgrades means more dead orcs! ... This game takes its place as one of the best tower defence games available today. With the announcement of a sequel on the way things are looking good for Robot Entertainment.
3425	1	a	This game is great if you like violence drinking and patriotism
624	1	a	Surprisingly fun and addictive First Player Perspective Tower Defence game. Creative level and trap design lets you experiment with different ways of clearing them. Oh. and once you get weavers you can be a mass-slaughterer of orcs personally. Good times!
1431	1	a	As a Portuguese, all that I can say is: '10/10 muh Empire, muh colonies, muh superpower'
3649	1	a	The flaggiest game around!
2059	1	a	Very good game, like all the others in the series Total War. I'm your big fan.
1635	1	a	This game is one of the greatest games ever. I love the Total War franchise. Their is so much to do and love. Prussia is my personal fave.  One problem, countries like Russia, Mughals and couple of others are really boring to play as. Russia is to undeveloped (while historically acurate) this can be annoying and difficult, Moscow and Kiev are really your only regions to think off. And talk about an underpowered military. But if you can put in the hard work and patience Russia and Mughals can become absoulte monsters.   I sent my bears all over Europe, crushing all the eagles and lions.
3890	1	a	I loved this game when it was first released... 6 years on I still love although the grapics are getting hard to stomach esspecially compared to ROME2....  10/10 from me... this is in my opinion the best TWgame in the series, it has the largest campain map, first in the series to introduse 3D sea battles and the TW team did the 3D sea battles extremely well, the commodoties trade income system was a very well done added feature, adding minor settlements to the region to support the main settlement was another more realistic approach to developing an empire than previous games.... there are to many good points to mention.  bad points.... still to this day even after all these years from release, the AI... I cant understand some of the desicions the AI makes.... eg: when playing as Prussia in Hard Mode (Normal is far to easy), you start with a high diplomatic standing with Great Britain... your strongest friendship among the major factions.... first turn establish a trade agreement with them, they accept with no hesitation with a very posative responce in the diplomacy screen.... you as prussia on turn 2-3 have war declared on you by Austria (Britains Ally) Britain refuse to join their war against you forfeting their alliance with Austria... they remain a friend of Prussia. turn 6-7 after a few battles and skirmishes with Austria and maybe taking the odd territory you see Britain embark a massive Army on a Fleet heading into the Baltic sea...? turn 8 offer an alliance with GB... they accept with open arms and no counter offer, GB and PRUSSIA are now allied. turn 9 GB lands its Army in East Prussia declaring war and taking the city of Konigsburg from its ally Prussia... WTF!!!!!  that is my only hate about this game, the AI in campain mode is a real let down..... the difficulty settings are far to variant, the gap between Normal difficulty and hard is massive, the game is way to easy on Normal mode but on Hard the AI far to unpredictable, esspecialy when it comes to treraties and diplomacy... its more like playing another player completly disregarding any need for treaties.... its great that over the years TW had made improvements to the AI in the battle map and a few other little tweaks but they really needed to focus on the AI in the Campain in my opinion.  apart from that a wonderfully enjoyable game  I hope and I cant wait to see EMPIRE2: TOTAL WAR if/when they make it.
537	1	a	Totally nuts. If you like tower defense and/or action games, this game is for you. Not much story in it, but hey! Who needs a story, if you can build all kinds of traps and participate in the action?
3002	0	a	I have got Napoleon...       AND BOY IS IT WAYYYYYYYYYYYYY BETTER!
2534	1	a	An amazing game that includes both detailed naval and line battles, as well as a nice Grand Campaign. This game does, however, have many glitches in battles and the campaign, and AI is not that smart at all. I overall recommend if you are interested and strategy and tactics.
3517	1	a	Colonial line of faaaanny. The game you need if you've ever felt like shooting and conquering some rebelious americans.
1833	1	a	This has become my favorite Total War game. No doubt it has many flaws (the least of which are technical issues, which really hamper the game at times). But IMO, with the correct Mods (i.e. Darthmod) this game is the largest in scope and really gives you the sense of controlling a world wide empire.   What makes this game so enjoyable for me is the incredible amount of variance in play throughs. Your campaign as Great Britain or The United Provinces, which sees a lot of overseas expansion, is likely going to be very different than a campaign as Austria or one of the Indian factions, which are much more land locked. Of course, you can always mix it up and change history by taking over Europe as the Ottoman Empire, then invade and conquer the Americas.   The actual battles are great as well, and again with the right mods they can actually be a challenge. t is very fun to assault an enemy position or to use the terrain to make a strong defensive position and repel enemy attacks. I think the graphics and animations during battles are superb, even if more recent titles like Shogun 2 have improvements.   As I mentioned this is my favorite Total War game, and will likely remain so as Rome 2 is a mess and I just can't bring myself to play it.
2933	1	a	It's a good game; however, naval wars are boring as the game play speed during naval wars is very slow. Also, there are very low incentives to build a strong navy as docks are not included towards the region captured. Overall, I would recommend the game.
3095	1	a	Epic real-time stratagy game! The faith of your empire is in your hands!
3871	1	a	the game is good but it's graphicks are pretty bad + the AI sucks.
2133	1	a	You can replay scenes from Patriot. 18/18
4889	1	a	You get fly around in spaceships like a baws.
3617	1	a	The Road to Independence Campaign is pretty fun.
4781	1	a	Excellent fun, eminently playable, sandbox with story, I love it
325	1	a	Does what it says on the tin.
1905	1	a	Very good and I recommend buying it.
1089	1	a	Very fun game with a good variety of towers to choose from.
2778	1	a	This is a great game
2671	1	a	It seemed a bit off in the beginning coming from medieval 2 and rome 1 , but checking some gameplay from DipplexHeated and lionheartx10 taught me how to fight in the 18th century and after that, oh boy. Best total war imho, even better than Medieval 2 , because of the grand scope of things, Lots of mods, especially Darthmod is a must . Actually this game made me appreciate and fall in love with a time period i had not the slightest idea what was all about. So yeah. I actually don't hope for an Empire 2, seeing how they are â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ the total war series, im hoping for some other developer to get the idea and make a new game. That would bring tears of joy in my eyes. Totally worth the price and the time .
2647	1	a	This game is 10/10.
2475	1	a	#1 lining up dudes and making them shoot at eachother simulator
1112	1	a	Surprisingly funny game. You're a young battlemage, who uses his crossbow and tons of traps, to hold back incomming waves of orcs. Though it sounds like a standard Tower-Denfese game, it personally reminded me of Dungeon Keeper 2. I approve!
1007	1	a	Pretty Bad â¥â¥â¥
956	1	a	This game is surprisingly fun.
4674	1	a	The first few chapters are great; then the zombies become prominent. After that, it's tedious and repetitive.  I'm so tired of zombies. Take them away, please. Give me Space Pirates without Zombies (SPWOZ).
1454	1	a	this game takes total war to a new level
625	1	a	I first tried Orcs Must Die! 2 at RTX and loved it. So I get the first one. Solo is a lot of fun but playing it with a friend is the best way to play this game.
3376	1	a	very extensive game and detailed as well, but it can be quite heavy on medium to low rigs.
504	1	a	very fun if you are fun of games like ballon tower defence and all that 
632	1	a	Shoot all the orcs!! Set traps for orcs!!! Oooooorcs!
2824	1	a	Good game for people that like strategy games and war games. It combines adventure with strategy as you try to conquer the world while pleasing your peasents.
2593	1	a	My all time favorite game! I wish they would make Empire 2!
3264	1	a	There is a simple reason why Creative Assemly games are called Total War. It's because in the end it's always total war because they cannot program a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing decent campaign AI. You can be allied with a nation for 50 years only for them to declare war randomly on you for no â¥â¥â¥â¥ing reason whilst you having the world's largest military in the game. The Swiss is to just randomly declare war on you even though they have but only a single city guarded by one unit of melee warriors when you have legions of riflemen backed up with cannons.  Oh on a sidenote, never trust the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing Dutch every â¥â¥â¥â¥ing time they will backstab you.
1251	0	a	A lazy port from a tablet game. The different levels have random difficulty and there's nothing really unforgettable or just cool in this very classical tower defense.
2452	0	a	The game has incredibly blurry, almost unreadable text for certain monitors and resolution settings (mainly widescreens). This issue is apparently very common based on my hours of research, and was caused by a bad patch, but the developer simply moved on and left those of us affected with a borderline-unplayable game.  I have messed with all possible settings configurations nd cannot find an actual solution that allows me to play the game for more than 10 minutes without a headache.  This issue is especially odd considering I can play Medieval 2 (an older title in the series) with no problems.  Do not buy this game unless you are willing to accept this risk.
2738	1	a	d00d this game be gewd
301	1	a	Nice one.
3889	1	a	One of the easier of the Total War games, with my tatics staying more or less the same for all difficulties, if you want a challenge I'd recommend being the Netherlands. Having said that there's something gratifying about decimating and army with artillery and making them retreat without sustaining a single casualty.
672	1	a	Tower Defense done right. Well is it really tower defense? It's a yes and no. Towers in this case are traps and you can place them during waves as well if you have money. However you yourself can also defend (much like Sanctum, in fact these two are simliar in more ways then one). Some of the early levels you can beat without usinga single trap but later you'd have a very hard if not impossible time (in my opinion) to beat the levels without using traps. Traps vary from simple floor spikes and wall arrows to flame spitting floor traps and tar pits. It's not your traditional tower defense but it fits enough for me to put it in this genre. Upgrades to the traps comes outside of the levels and are permanent. No need to worry about which one to upgrade, you do it once and it's for good. There are a lot of traps and weapons in this game, a great variety for many different strategys and plenty of replay value.
298	1	a	Perfect blend of third-person action and tower defense. Plus, you get to kill thousands of Orcs. Seriously, F*ck Orcs. They are like wanna be Hulks, and are about as smart as the Jersey Shore crew.
2942	1	a	I have not really played much. The game is quite good though.
427	1	a	I'm a big Bloon Tower Defense player, so I thought that I had the end all of tower defense games on my iphone already. Oh how wrong I was. This is a great tower defense game, with a nice bit of hack-and-slash thrown in. I'm about halfway through the first act ( I think) and while some towers I have now seem to serve no purpose, and although I keep picking them when I first get them (eg steam trap without a combo for it) I'm sure later in the game they'll have a great combo (certain trap seem to be designed to be put together).  The only thing I wish is that I could choose from any trap/weapon whenever I want, instead of picking and choosing a certain amount at the start of a round. It's just something I'm used to from playing Bloons, but I've gotten over it already. Thats part of the challenge.  I'd give this a 8/10
4436	1	a	Age of Empires makes a comeback by jumping forward to the Imperial Era. Cannons, muskets, armed cavalries, large vessels and more cannons present a change of pace from the old sword-and-shield Age of Empires II. The third instalment of the franchise also introduces trading routes, a set of locations that you have to capture and control by building trading posts on it, reinforcing your income and XP gain. You can order shipments of goods from your mainland at intervals of time and befriend local indigenous tribes.  In a sense, there are plenty of new features to keep long time fans of Age of Empires interested, while retaining the same core gameplay. Build stuff, gather stuff, advance Ages, kill baddies. Only this time, with more cannons.
940	1	a	Nice tower defense,with funny voice acting :-) 7/10
3965	1	a	It's a awesome game apart from a few bugs and glitches here and there, but the glitches and bugs DO NOT affect the gameplay in anyway! Or is it just my opinion?
1444	1	a	i bought Total War Grand Master Collection. recommended. Very nice game!!!!
2726	1	a	Played this game for hours when i first got it. Tons of fun. Its still fun to jump on every now and then. The UI is much better then most Total War games. One of the best In my opinion.
615	1	a	A fun game of tower defense and FPS
2155	1	a	Why does everyone hate this/batter this to no end? Ok, there may have been bugs on launch, but the patches fixed them, so now it's actually playable. Get an unlock all factions mod and you're set.
3126	1	a	Sometimes I stare out my window pondering the best way to maximize my gainz.
5088	1	a	It's an ok game if you like â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ RPGs and â¥â¥â¥â¥
122	1	a	What it says on a tin.  Fun!  Fun-fun-fun. Polished game, smooth action. Game feels fluid and responsive Enjoyable. Challenging enough, nice pacing, has character progression.
4040	1	a	Accidentally unified all the Germanic peoples and started a world war. Would recommend.
732	1	a	its the best game on earth
4374	1	a	i like walking the piles of bodies after a battle. 10/10
365	1	a	AWESOME. there really isn't another word for it. crazy addictive, fun, rewarding with a little bit of carnage thrown in. if you like the 'tower defense' type of games you're going to love this game. On top of that its crazy cheap for what you get. I highly reccomend it to everyone
3076	1	a	the mods keep this game alive and it is good 
3204	1	a	great game. get civil war mod or darth mod to improve experience
2198	1	a	This game has the most biggest map when it comes to the realistic setting because you can fight in india, europe, and america
5021	1	a	THIS GAME IS AWESOME!!! if you love space this is the game for you.
1294	1	a	Started an Austrian campaign with the intentions of using their light infantry to skirmish my way to to an Austrian empire in western Europe.  Despite my best intentions of leaving the mighty Ottoman empire alone I was eventually drawn into a war with them while my armies were busy in France.   I got steamrolled pretty badly and it was clear that I couldn't hold out on two fronts.  Taking inspiration from another famous Austrian I decided to Boys From Brazil the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of it. Fully half of my forces were left to turtle up around my strongest city, defending a bunker as it were, and hold out as long as possible before the inevitable. The rest were piled into what naval strength I had and sailed for the New World.   Several turns later they arrived and took over a South American province just before my last one in mainland Europe fell (thus knocking me out of the game) and the rest of the South American provinces fell shortly afterwards.   Eventually the Austrian Empire Reborn was able to conquer most of the Americas and return to Europe to dish out some extremely righteous vengeance.  10/10, would proto-Hitler again.
1058	1	a	While I admit this game is quite fun, it's just not as enjoyable as it would be if it had multiplayer. Worth it? If you don't mind doing everything by your lonesome.
4229	1	a	great game
4581	1	a	Fantastic game from it's ship customization to the animations. Extrmely amazed this was made by 2 people! This is a must buy for anyone!
4101	1	a	Endless hours of fun. can't wait for Warhammer Total War
2171	0	a	This game is a major disappointment. It has a large number of bugs, some of which break the game in a way that will not allow you to progress further into the game. I highly recommend that if you play this game you make sure that you have about 5 save in order to avoid having to start the game all over again. I would not recommend buying this game for anything over $5 and even that is a little to much to pay. It would have been better if this game had workshop.
715	1	a	Really enjoying this game, Great amount of traps to play with and great selection of weapons. If you enjoy tower defence games but wanna also play a character on them this is for you.
1226	0	a	I enjoy Tower Defense titles.  I did not enjoy this one  2/10
2568	1	a	Amazing played as Britain and absorbed the colonies, killed off sweden, and invaded paris with the nights watch all in one sitting.
5310	1	a	Can't tell you if you should buy it or not, but I can tell you this. You will find annoying bugs, highly requested features that isn't there and lack of content if you're not satisfied with what you have.  But when you really get down to it, and experience some of the awesome scenarios you can get in multiplayer and custom sp mission, it's something magical you just can't find in any other game.  Arma is not a game which you pick up at launch, play the campaign and a bit of mp, and then trow away. You buy it, love it or hate it, and then play it forever or trow it away immediatly. Arma is a game which you can never called finished. There will always be added to it, be it user or official content, fixes, features or optimizations.   Hope I expressed myself correctly and that you learned something from it :)  If you like realistic shooters and organized large scale multiplayer warfare, this will be your gem!  I'll give it a 9/10, simply because: screw bugs, I've used hundreds of hours on Arma 3 that I would never take back.   READ: I will not accept random friend requests! If you have a question, please post it in the comments.
1091	1	a	What a refreshing taste of Castle Defence. If you are a Castle Defence fan, this will be an amazing experience. 5/5 for sure.
3566	1	a	This is one of my favorite games, I like the idea to take over the world (for the most part) and to change history! If you are a strategy fan defenitly try this game out! And yes the battles are amazing.
2291	0	a	Yankee doodle went to gamestop, riding in his hummer.  Picked this game up and said it was a Bummer.
1924	1	a	With the Darthmod add on this game is a masterpiece.
1734	1	a	This is a great game if you are looking to rule the world if it is Playing singleplayer or with Friends this is a great game over all if you like games like Risk. My rate form 1/10 Would be a 8 1/2 
1911	1	a	Very intense and very addicting. Great RTS/Grand Strategy that covers a lot of history (even though not all of it is accurate) The campaign is fun, but short so make sure to get the DLCs when they are on sale.
1649	1	a	for 20 bucks its well worth the caps. ive had it for a few years i always come back. every battle is different. you can play as most of the major countries all around the world. awesome online play anff great graphics for the time
2659	1	a	Love it!
2428	1	a	Sprites ugly
4648	1	a	can't shake this game. just a top-down rpg with fun upgrades and some cool as â¥â¥â¥â¥ physics. of course i wish there were more factions and resources and economy mechanics, but then i tell myself to stop being such a puss. and right now it's just a dollar ninety nine anyways. i drink that in beer in thirty seconds.
2920	1	a	Vanilla: a good, but frustrating TW Darthmoded: THE BEST TW EVER. Almost 1800 hours on it, what else can i say...
3899	1	a	This is probably one of my favroite games of all times, you can tell by how many hours I've played. It's very realistic, the weaponry is not overkill were every shot hits and its not were an artillery shell lands and everyone is dead in the area. It all depends on the type and size of the shell, normally, a direct hit from a 6 pounder will kill about 5 of their guys while a direct hit with a howitzer will kill ten. The graphics are amazing, just because it is 6 years old doesn't mean the graphics are bad. every face is different. The world in this game is massive spanning the Bahama's, North America, Central America, the Northern part of South America, Europe, North Africa, The Middle East, and India. Each nation has a huge assortment of troops and a tech tree that goes on by the ages. A suggustion is to play as Britian, they are my personal favroite. 11/10, its amazing.
2721	1	a	Amazing the best Total war game there is.  All the expansion pack are awesome.  There is nothing to love about this game 9.5/10
2687	1	a	'The A.I. never attacks the Isles!' - British Guy Probably
526	1	a	Really enjoyed it. Incredibly addcitive. Its nice to see that the ex-ensemble guys are still doing good work. If you like third person action or tower defense you should pick it up. its only 15 bucks. totally worth the buy.
1966	0	a	Ok! I admit myself I love the Total War games! Unfortunately this one wasn't what I expected. Bunch of lag in the campaign map, UI can sometimes be screwed up, and the AI is at it's worst. Not saying this is definitely the worst of the series, but don't spend your money on this one. Get Medieval 2, Shogun 2 or Rome 1 for a great experience!
4001	1	a	One of thebest total war games so far. The rebellions are far to common (considering the 18th century had very few rebellions, if it was the middle ages with Baron revolts I would understand). The Cavalry and Artilerry are nerfed in this game, but it still is a highly enjoyable experience. I have played this game for over 200 hours (off steam). It doesn't deserve the bad press it gets. This game is a worthwhile buy.
175	1	a	Jean Kirstein strongly approves of this game.
3862	1	a	such a great game even though it was made in 2008, the only thing that i dident like much was the cannons i think they lacked firepower but besides that im realy enjoying this game and hope they continue to create these types of games
5089	1	a	I was a bit aprehensive and couldn't decide weather to buy SPAZ or not .I left that idea for couple of weeks and I came back to it just yesterday. Well...I have already spent over 15h of playing SPAZ and I got to tell you : the game is well worth the money ,it is not one dimentional space game as I previously thought. It is rich and deep ! You do missions and level up your ships and hangar .You collect blueprints from wreckage's and research and manufacture new components or entire  ships. You can hire a specialists and train them to be more efficient as your crew. Dock to the station buy new gear there ,choose which faction you wanna be friends with and which you wanna be seen as foe .But beware there is also a group of bounty hunters that on some stage of plaing SPAZ will start following your tracks. Travel throu spacious Universe from one solar system to another ,break through  enemies gate ,develop your skills and use those ,mine Rez to get rich ,and many ,many more option in SPAZ are waiting for you. Do not hesitate ! :)
3983	1	a	If you want a game that is hugely strategy based and very addicting...look no farther! You can either play story mode as the growing United States or pick almost ANY other major nation in 1700 and run that nation however you want with the globe at your mercy! Battle control scenes are epic and amazingly fun...plus once you get really good you can bring your tactics to online play against real people! And if you want to beef it up I suggest you download Darthmod as it will make the game ten times even better for campaigns! It was my first ever Total War game and will always be my favorite. BEST overall TOTAL WAR GAME...period!!!
557	1	a	Fast, fun and easy to pick up.
740	1	a	Best story ever. Needs movie adaptation. 12/10 Would bang again.
2134	1	a	BRILL GAME MUST HAVE 
884	1	a	Hilarious, fun, wonderful. Worth every penny, action packed and strategic.
3876	1	a	If you like historical games and strategy games you will like this game. Empire is rather notorious in the total war community for bieng a buggy failure but its so much after bieng patched.   The Single-player will provide hours of just..one..more..turn, and will challenge you in ways (Russia is usually a pain in the â¥â¥â¥) and can make you very satisfied after you've completed it(or completely wasted your time). The campaign map is fairly efficient, with tabs like diplomacy and research. The map also might have some performance issues depending on your computer but it is overall a decnt part of the game. The battles are smooth and interesting, even though it has its issues. Your army is clearly defined against the enemies with the troop colors or the banner representing the nation you're playing on top of one of your units.   Overall its a great game to waste time on.
3647	1	a	this game is really fun once you get into it
4975	1	a	Affordable replayability.   Explore the randomly generated galaxies in this shooter/rpg as you also explore build options and upgrades.
4083	1	a	Slaughtered native americans with cannons   10/10 would commit genocide again
2421	1	a	Doesn't take long to immerse yourself in this gem and still looks great for it's age. Marching your armies across Europe, the Americas and the Sub-Continent to further your Colonial power. I played as Great Britain to start with and had jolly good fun wiping out the peace loving native tribes in the new world. Burning down their villages and installing my own Governorâs to out their old beliefs.  The good 'old Christian way!!!
4366	1	a	IMO the best total war game cant beat the scale and really love the time period
1953	0	a	Garbage ===========================  The controls are cumbersome and the units randomly disobey orders, making control on the battlefield frustrating:  - the units keep switching to slow speed whenever you reroute them while marching - artillery frequently keeps firing even after you order it to pack and retreat (killing your own advancing troops) only if you deselect 'fire at will' it's guaranteed to stop - you can't create a path with waypoints.  Battles, and especially sieges, are ludicrous and pathetic: - Forts are indestructible - the only way to capture them is by climbing the walls (really, in the age of artillery?) - The battle map is too small, you are not allowed to freely deploy your army and the game assigns you the most inconvenient spot  - reinforcing enemy armies appear out of nowhere right near you, without any notice - artillery that rarely hits anything, although it's 'accuracy' is 45%. I tested once firing against a still infantry formation and registered a hit after 30 rounds. - brain dead AI that keeps standing still in the middle of artillery fire - large rebel armies with cavalry and artillery units spawned against game mechanics (how could recruitment happen so fast especially when you have 20 unit army in the province - and where would the money come from)  The game map is terribly unbalanced, the provinces are way too large and weirdly separated.  The whole concept of 'gentlemen' and rakes is completely beyond me, especially the difficulty in assasinating them. You should at least be able to expel or arrest them as an 'absolute monarch' of a mighty 'empire'. It would have been much better if you could recuit them like you do with armies and send them as ambassadors.  Units appearing on the map are too large and those stupid flags are too big and obtrusive.  Extremely dense and suicidal AI players that keep declaring war against much bigger opponents: if you declared war on me and I took three of your provinces including the capital, how would I give you one of my provinces when you call for peace?  Too much art, too little substance.
4550	1	a	This is a really awesome game.
318	1	a	Great Game, the people who made Shadow of Mordor make they're own version!
5148	1	a	SPAZ is truly one of the best games i have played since years.  Sure, it does not offer the brilliant uber graphics from many modern shooters, but hey - that is neither intended nor necessary. The whole rest - including gameplay itself, long-term motivation and simply FUN to play - is totally worth it. It is as if you can feel around every little corner of the game how much heart has been put into it.  Considering the fact that this game was created by mainly only two guys, it is a true masterpiece.  Very good job, guys!
565	1	a	Already got it on the Xbox but had to buy it on PC as well. Besides the fact that it's so good I just want to throw money at these guys, I also prefer the prettier graphics on PC :D
2737	1	a	This game is amazing, one of the best RTS games ever made. It has a very complex system, but easy to learn. I was playing as Prussia and spent 30 minutes thinking up a strategy for taking Warsaw (down to the very last detail of combat.) I then started the assault and my Line Infantry flanked both sides of the fort, while hordes of militia stormed the front. Everything was going according to plan until atleast 60 Polish horsemen, and 80 line infantry charged out the front gate at my militia. Everything went bad. Shows how the best laid plans sometimes don't go according to plan.   10/10 IGN would conquest again
1763	1	a	I made Austria declare war on germany, my army got slaughtered, so i went home and bought this game and had a lot of fun. 8/10 
4774	1	a	.
434	1	a	Finally, a high budget TD! And it kicks a$$!
2034	1	a	this game is one of the best of the time period but for me it won't open anymore
2233	0	a	Riddled with bugs. Savegames corrupted constantly. Idiotic unit pathing. After 5 years they still haven't fixed this â¥â¥â¥â¥?
3050	1	a	This game does stand the test of time. I find myself always playing it when nothing else feels fun.
4507	1	a	This game is brilliant. There's no other way to describe it. The sense of combat this game gives you is absolutely among the best I've ever experienced. If you're ripping the enemy a new one, you can tell. If you're getting ripped a new one, you can definitely tell.  This game can be punishing too, forcing you to grind your way through certain areas, which is a bit of a downside. However, you shouldn't really face that issue unless you're playing on INSANE! and are fighting 10 tech levels above you.  There's a lot more I could talk about but all in all, this game a great buy for a cheap price. As of now I've already sunk 16 hours into this game and I plan on sinking many, many more into it. 9.5/10!
3817	1	a	great game so vast you can take your time and enjoy the whole experence highly reccomended best game of the total war franchise so far
4530	1	a	Very interesting game!!
2430	1	a	I highly recommend this game for exciting map and battle modes.
2275	0	a	Haven't played the game yet, but if it's anything like STEAM . . . it's going to suck!
2755	1	a	Best total war game so far hands down
2810	1	a	great game for campains and loads of mods support so 10/10
4284	1	a	Very fun strategy game happening in the time of the british empire. every big country is included in this game as im sure of. Have had fun just casually playing 1v1s with my relative.
4129	1	a	its a game you can play a thousand times and never have the same outcome
2141	1	a	This is a Great Game for the Patient Mind.

1922	1	a	look at my hours on record. says it all a must buy
532	1	a	Orcs Must Die! is one of those really great indie-titles that deserves more attention than it has got. Sure the second game is way better, but nonetheless the first game rocks too! A first-person tower defence, Orcs Must Die! finds the perfect balance between tactical setups and mindless killing action. The game becomes quite challenging later - which can be good for some I bet. I, for one, can have a hard time controlling the battlefield, when enemies swarm from every side.  The designs of traps, levels and enemies are classic, but great, and the game offers hours of fun. The variety of traps are remarkable, and fighting alongside your tactical setup is a great way of playing this kind of game. Though the game lacks co-op, which thankfully has been addressed in the sequel.  DIE!!! .... After you have bought the game.
952	1	a	Orcs Must Die! is a tower defense game that takes the point of view behind the actor to be apart of the mayhem. With the rise in popularity in such games in the console market, Orcs Must Die! is a nice addition that brings some new gameplay mechanics to the genre to keep it fresh. Itâs fierce, fast paced, and thereâs nothing better than killing orcs. Man, orcs are stupid.   http://iamericm.com/2014/04/orcs-must-die-indie-game-review/ 
2937	1	a	Excellent game; historically correct, battles are second to none and the graphics/unit detail is outstanding.
1673	1	a	It's different than other TW games, but it's a refreshing change. Guns don't make the game less exciting, as some argue; instead, they require a change of tactics. Playing in the colonial era can actually be quite fun.  The graphics are an improvement, though they aren't great, but in this kind of game, I prefer gameplay over visuals. The gameplay is great - the world is gigantic, there is a new building system that makes building multiple structures simultaneously possible, there is a technology and philosophy research area, there are gentleman, naval battles where you can actually control your ships (I don't enjoy these much, though they look nice), there is North America and some of South America, and India (which we only got a glimpse of in Alexander!) There are many playable factions, and you can even unlock the American Indian factions by purchasing the Warpath DLC (this, again, requires a drastic change in strategy from the main ETW game, so buyer beware; it's probably also the only DLC worth buying, and only for a few bucks). Oh, and there's also the good ole US of A, which can be played in a campaign tracing the nation's development from a few settlers in Jamestown to an independent but vulnerable republic at the turn of the century.  A few cons: the game is a bit glitchy, battles usually take place in boring forts that all look the same instead of cities, cannon have limitless ammo (could be a pro), game can get slow with the sheer number of factions at the end of every turn. The game came out very unfinished, but it's been polished up and is now defnitely worth buying for any TW fan.
324	1	a	Orcs Must Die's formula is simple, but what little it does it does very, very well and is a riot to play. The traps are a ton of fun to use and trap deaths look fantastic and satisfying. The later additions of simplistic spell trees and spells round the game up nicely and killing orcs was never this much fun xD. If you get into the competitive nature of the game you'll find out how surprisingly deep it is as customizing your character and traps and selecting the 'right' ones can greatly impact your final stage score and the speed at which you move and place your traps can mean all the difference.  8.5/10
5313	1	a	This is quite possibly the most emotional shooter I've ever played, and it's not because of the campaign.   Crowd around, children, it's story time.  One day, not so long ago, my squad had just destroyed an anti-air battery. Our pilot landed, and the rest of the squad boarded one by one. I was about to get in when the rockets started flying.  The chopper lifted off, with my pilot saying that he would return in a few minutes. Unwilling to die before then, I rushed to the nearest cover, a small house by a narrow road. I entered to find a ten year-old player who had also been left behind. He explained that he was a sniper and invited me to join his 'clan'.  I politely declined, explaining that my own squad was inbound. As I finished, a Ghost Hawk flew over the horizon. My squad had arrived.  This noble child soldier and I were sprinting to the helicopter when the bullets started hitting. The sniper screamed as a 6.5 mm cartridge entered his leg. His shrieks for help were cut short by one final burst of carbine fire as I climbed in the transport.  My new friend was dead.  10/10, would experience survivor guilt again.
2817	1	a	a great and fun game to do battles line battles and it is historic a little bit
3326	1	a	If not for it crashes, this could be a great game.
3955	1	a	it is a great strategy game and war sim and is 10/10-shrek 2015
287	1	a	no funny one liner here, just a whole-hearted recommendation. buy this game. then, if you still havent had enough, buy the second one,.. but this one is better.
4496	1	a	Overall a great game.  Personally, I like to play games while I drink (hey, it keeps the replayability factor up when I forget :-P), watch Netflix and BS with buddies. This game is great for that in the sense that I can step away from it while it's running and not come back to a dead toon or missed out on something extremely important. Also (bonus points) if I get a little too far gone, chances are good that I again didn't miss something that I can't look back on the log to figure out what happend. I think this game may have been made specifically for me.  I love leveling up. I love keeping an eye on resources. I love the discovery aspect. I love upgrading and discovering new weapon/ship models. Oh and there's a fun storyline with multiple characters. The best part is that each one of them are friggin â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥! I hate dainty little do-gooders when it's a universe they just wouldn't survive in. Every character I've come across in this game thus far has been such a friggin @sshole and I love it!  I can't wait until SPAZ 2 comes out if it's anything like the original!  Play it, or don't. No one likes you anyway.
254	0	a	Yet again, this is NOT a recommendation. More like a warning to steer clear and spend your money elsewhere on more worthy titles.  The game has some very nice video's that hype the game up to levels if completely fails to reach when you finally start playing the game. And while this is not appearant at first. It slowly start sinking in after about 2 - 3 levels of this non-stop ogre killing.  To be honest, it's trying to be a tower-defence game but utterly fails at it as there are worse looking titles out there that are more fun and more challenging.  The game runs on most computers, looks nice, has some funny animations at times, but utterly fails at delivering any type of gameplay that was promised. Well, to correct myself, fails to deliver any type of gameplay that is FUN and was promised.  Recommandation is to go buy warcraft 3 and play tower defence there.  Rating 9 of 100
1036	1	a	Yo dawg I heard you like killin' orcs so we put some traps in your fortress so you can kill orcs while you kill orcs.
3503	1	a	Strategy at its finest
1459	1	a	i for one am a huge fan of RTS and this one of the better ones that played
256	0	a	It's like Dugeon Defenders, But not fun
3971	1	a	My history techare always said the genocide of an entire race of natives was abad thing, she was wrong 10/10 would genocide again
3445	1	a	one of best up to 4 in mulity player and you can conqor the world 
4375	1	a	The best stragety game ever made. You can control cannons, caverly, infintry, genarals, and more. You are the commander and you can control your troops and do tactics to achive victory on the battle ground. The game is so relistic that it looks like you are acually in with the rest of the men in the unites.
2379	0	a	Several game ending bugs and errors still plaque this otherwise intriquing title. End game crashes, and memory leaks leave you wishing that more testing by the devs was goal shared by all. All little extra effort and this could have been game of the decade... instead, so much wasted potential.
4472	1	a	Best Game i ever had bought in my life, the series AOE was my childhood and now it came to this much! I love it! I just love the game! I just pray microsoft makes a Sequel in future!
4087	1	a	Total War. Turn based civilation game with RTS combat. Total war mixs strengths from the Civilations games with more fast paced games like dawn of war.Fight in land or sea with a variety of units and countries to choose from This is a fun and challenging game
1661	1	a	Having sunken many hours into this game on many PC's, I can definitely reccomend ETW. The gameplay is extremely good, in both the grand strategy and RTS environments, and while I do feel that NTW does many thing better when it comes the RTS elements, I prefer Empire for it's setting and mods, which make a good game exeptional.  My choice of mods are -  Darthmod - A mod which includes hundreds of tweaks to make the game more realistic and challenging. AUM - The additional units mod by SwissHalberdier, adding many new units which massively boosted my enjoyment of the game.
5323	1	a	This game is the reason my girlfriend of four years and I broke up.  I do not regret a thing.
4252	1	a	I love it more than i love my profile picture
209	1	a	Boring too quick
2083	1	a	This game is very fun; Its an awesome, fun, and interesting RTS game that is set in the time of the late 1700s. You can take over the world, or keep your nation alive and wealthy by trading with other nations, or try to survive as your puny nation is hit by wave after wave of enemy troops.
4315	1	a	I like to pair my Total War gaming experiences with other media set during a similar time period. Corresponding films/games that go well with this game - The Patriot, John Adams (HBO), Assassin's Creed 3/4, The PBS Documentary series about the Civil War
580	1	a	Great little game of Tower Defense against countless Orcs where you are right in the action 3d person. Just replace the word Tower with Trap...
935	1	a	Good game if you are into tower defense, fps, bruce campbell and dead orcs.
2839	1	a	I enjoyed this game but bought it long after release when many of the bugs had been fixed. Some forts still have a fatal bottom step that will kill any soldiers that step on them (funny to see the pile at the end tho).
3447	1	a	Action
1345	1	a	CAs first real crack at focused firearm comat. This one saw many ups and downs but is still one of the most memorable Total War Games for me, though not the best. It was a truly experimental title for CA. A new engine, completely different combat mechanics, the first title to allow manual naval combat, a new era, one of the biggest campaign maps yet, and the introduction of a tech research tree. It was a breathtaking sight that, once growing pains had passed, delivered a monumental Total War experience that remains the title for which I most want a sequel. Fall of the Samurai showed just how far CA has come with this style of warfare and I cannot wait.   All that being said, the game isn't without its flaws. This was the last Total War title lacking cooperative multiplayer, there are a number a bugs, the AI is predictable, especially when they are defending a siege assault, and as with all Total War titles, the AI plays by a completely different set of BS rules. Including non existant army upkeep, no resistance to occupation, agents with nigh 100% success rates...   Even with its flaws, it is a unique Total War title that offers an experience no other in the series can, for now. Absolutely recommend it.
4677	1	a	Go around the galaxy and do various jobs and grab minerals and upgrade your ships. Collect crew mans from defeated ships and make alliances and then backstab them.
2397	1	a	Amazing, have been playing it for years and still not bored of the action. This game is absolutely revelutionary. The addition of naval battles to the Total War series has made an incredible contribution to the gameplay, making Empire Total War my absolute favorite all the series.
699	1	a	buy game very good plz
4233	1	a	its ok, something wrong with diplomacy and my allies always want to tke my stuff, as in i want trade/they want a bit of land $3000 and unlimited access. So it is a tad broken in the grand campaign. battles are good but; all the units feel the same(footmen are all the same just have different skins).
2521	1	a	u are freaking â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ if u dont own this game
975	1	a	Great tower defense game with lots of action.
2356	1	a	Quite simply, probably the best total war game to date in terms of replayability.
882	1	a	Humorous, entertaining and great replayability. A must have for the sequal to unlock the classic levels. (9/10)
1748	1	a	Huge game. Love playing for hours (and hours and hours)
4940	1	a	This game is excellent. Fun, snappy, full of wit and really addictive combat. I could not recommend this enough.
2703	0	a	Worst game Ä± have ever seen. Don't buy this â¥â¥â¥â¥ game!
907	1	a	Really an amazing game. Various traps, various abilities, various unlockables, and TONS of replayability. So many levels, difficulties, scores, orcs,... Stop reading this and get it.
2183	0	a	This game would be great, if not for all the bugs. Limitless number of bugs that can ruin hours worth of effort put into your campaign. Some fort battles don't work, ai bugs that freezes the game, etc.
2209	1	a	just another well done total war game
135	1	a	One of the best single player Action / Tower Defence games money can buy. Cheap and extremely fun, highly recomended.
4085	1	a	Play as Sweden All my neighbors declare war Lose in 30 turns 10/10 would get stomped again
2711	1	a	-Play as Sweden -Disband a percentage of the army (for the monis) -Gets Invaded by Poland,Russia and Denmark immediately.   10/10 would try to be neutral again.
5211	1	a	AWSOME TOP DOWNSPACE GAME : arcade controlls, detailed salvage and mining, awsome ship upgrades, totaly worth ownig and playing!
3814	1	a	
3372	1	a	wish i could play ireland
960	1	a	[]V[]ega-worth getting. Fun, challenging, quick, and easy to play. Challenge yourself and compare to me!!! Buy this game!
126	1	a	Really fun game, reminds me of the days of dungeon keeper and setting up traps for the invasion of the good guys, Well in orcs must die, you are the good guys, doing it the other way round, setting traps for the bad guys.   Great game to play, can't recommend enough.
4750	1	a	This game wasn't really worth of my money even though it was a 75% off deal. I played it for about 3-4 hours but it didn't really interest me after that. Guess these kind of games with all that grinding and stuff isn't for me then ._. But i like pokÃ©mon... There's a lot of grinding there.  But That doesn't mean i shouldn't recommend it, because i'm sure there's a lot of people who's searching and wanting to play a game like these. So recommending isn't really my choice cause i don't know every gamer in the world. Bai!
2178	1	a	It's Total War, a genre of its own. If you like strategy, Empire is a must buy. :)
3637	1	a	Great game
706	1	a	Lots of traps, even more orcs, rifts, egocentric and big-headed apprentice. Funny taunts and dialogues in the midst of flying spare body orc parts everywhere. Yes, that's this game. Silly thing it is =]
2348	1	a	Very enjoyable game thousands of hours of game play mulitiplayer is good and you can play as you own nation and travel the world
741	1	a	A nice little break from Skyrim
2939	1	a	Recommend for Total War players.
832	1	a	Even if you don't reach for scoring, it's a very nice game to play. I'm not in tower-defence but this TPS-ish version of it is much fun.
808	1	a	it's ok  buy the second 1.  (&gt; -.- )&gt; / 5
2226	0	a	I have found it impossable to give a good review about this game. Battle mechanics are fun and the factions are cool. There are only 2 things i find bad about this game. However they are big issues. The second biggest problem is bugs and graphics. The graphics are Trash. with people looking like it was animated 10 year old and people sliding instead of walking like magic everywhere. The biggest problem is mac and Pc gamers cant play together. with most players wanting purely multiplayer action to prove there metal or plain fun. I feel like Total War treats mac players who paid just as much unfairly. Why cant this game be cross platform? Rome 2 is so we know it possiable. just put the time and effort on these issues and you will have so many more players/customers and less bad reviews.
1782	1	a	I absolutely love this game, who would not want to take over the Americas? who would not want to watch Russia take over India? who would not want to help the maratha confederacy take over the world? Who would not want to have the chance to kill some Frence? Who would not want the chance to make trade partners for Britain?   So many possibilities, it is a endless game that no one can say is boring, i loved this game more than i liked shogun 2 and napoleon total war put together ( probally because i do not like those ones ).   An example of how good this game is: When i was Austria i thought expanding into the ottoman empire would be the best possibility. However i needed to expand into Germany a little first to secure my poistion. When i invaded Prussia my good friend poland- lithuania went to the aid of the Prussians and declared war on me, I did not want to take their lands however so i soon amde a peace treaty with them. Once i had taken the settlement i wanted i tried to make peace with the Prussians, they did refuse so i was forced to continue my war. However i soon realized they was not going to go through the poland - lithuania territory to get me, so i moved further into Germany territory. but soon i was stabbed in the back by the polish ( just they do now to us English ) I was forced to raise more armies to deal with tem, this caused tention between me and my western allies. Once poland- lithuania was mine i had to invade my allies, this made more friction between me and Britain, my second best friend. Then before i got the chance to Invade the Ottoman empire ( my original plan ) The spanish declared that my monarch was not the true blood to my throne ( my kind had died leaving a Queen in charge of a country - Oh no! ) I soon invaded alsace and lorraine and paris. once they were mine i payed for a peace treaty with Spain, due to them being widespread i didn't want to wait to build strong navies. By this point Britain was nervous of my power and did not like me, even though they were still my allies. And the ottoman empire i wanted to invade loved me completely.   This shows just how much the game can change over the time you play, adding to the complexity of the whole game. I know that during my European wars Britain was taking over the thirteen colonies and at war with france and spain. This made Britain more of a threat to me, since they now had a average sized amount of land in the Americas, and nce they fell in Erope i would have another potential threat over in the Americas.    The guns also are brilliant to use! I often just make a army of cheap line infantry just so i can let the enemy come towards me, their cavelry always dies shortly after. My cannons ( 1 to 2 units ) always lower enemy moral before they get into my range of fire for my infantry. Then the cavelry ( 1 to 2 units ) always cover the flanks and kill the runaways at the end of the battle.    Over all i can say that i really recomend this game and that anyone who does not agree that this is a brilliant game should go back to it and reconsider their choice.   Sorry about this being a overly long review by the way, i hope that no one has gotten bored reading it.   for anyone wanting to know more of these battle stories please join my group, t is dedicated to the total war series, we have player of the week and regular announcements and discussions. the discussions are about which faction we use in what games and more while the announcements are for planning a multiplayer campaign in advance. I believe that anyone interested in the total war series should join my group, 17 members currently ( 28 / 2 / 14 ).   Yours Sincerly Giaus Julius Ceasar
4345	1	a	Global commerce and colonial expansion. Some find the campaign map unwieldy, but I fell in love. I'm a micromanager at heart and love pulling the strings of a global empire.   The battles are beautiful. Linear warfare fits the Total War engine very well. One of the better games in the series.
2836	1	a	Top Game
4308	1	a	I love this game, it's a great intro into the Total War series.
2789	1	a	Strong overall with a very large map and playable area, Along with a unit mixure comparable to Rome and [(hopefully) Rome II Total War]&lt;------ Even Empire makes RTW II look bad :(.
1600	1	a	Absolutely fun! This game is very instructive, but this is very hard, too, especially at the beginning. But when you learn how to play, you can't practically stop playing.  Campaign is very entertaining and interesting. You can choose empire from year 1700, and do whatever you want. You can raid trade routes, wage war against other countries and conquer them. You can develop new technology, make massive army/navy and upgarde buildings like farms, for examble.  You can play Battle, too. This mode is only for battles against CPU or other players. You can develop your tactics in war and get the great feeling of massive victory.  I recommend this game for players who are interested in Strategy games. This is elite of Total War -series and all Strategy games. Price of this game is suitable. If you like Strategy, you can play this practically 100+ hrs, so 19,99 â¬ isn't big price. And if you are interested in, buy all DLCs. They are so cool and make this game even better. Thank you for reading, hope this helped you if you weren't sure, do you buy this or not! 4,5/5
4207	1	a	great game but to bad that a lot of promised features were left out at the final game
440	1	a	Great game. Killing the orcs, ogres and the other momsters is fun using the variety of weapons, spells and traps. yeye! I have such good high scores too yeye!!!
5108	1	a	This game is one of the best space games i've ever played. Even though it's a 2D, i find it much better than most space action games i played, even the X series. The dozen hours i spent on this game were all worth it. I recommend this game to anyone that like space action games.
5009	1	a	One of the best top down shooters in the space genre that I have played. Every weapon is affected by physics and the gameplay is just amazing. They have so far sent out tons of free DLC and one free expansion and they aren't planning on stopping now.  I highly recommend buying this game both to support Indie developers (who create the games of their dreams &amp; share it to all of us) and to support the game itself future SPAZ 2.
4553	1	a	This 2D space shooter gives you quick, fun gameplay and ship modification that allows for unique approaches to beating the game's many challenges. Overall it isn't all too complicated, and would make a great game for those who aren't looking for something complicated for the sake of being complicated.
3355	1	a	And what is to say about this game. well it was the first in the total war series to have Naval battles you actualy took part in, it was the first to be mainly composed of gun powder weapons, ect   the game is ground breaking for the TW series tho it does have quirks its still a very good game
2362	1	a	I first played this with a fairly average gaming set up. My PC wasn't up to scratch and it was pretty slow.  Fast-forward to three years later (2014). This is a pretty different TW experience altogether. I'm so used to the close-quarters combat you see in other TW titles, this one took me by surprise, with the game featuring units with more slower paced, long range weaponry.  I always wanted to experience the 1700s American Revolutionary wars, and now I can. The campaign takes a lot of getting used to. I'm still learning as I write this review. It is a lot slower than previous entries, but don't let it take you away from the game.  There are A LOT of factions in this installment - and I do mean a lot! Early adopters of this game found themselves looking at the end-turn screen more often than using the campaign map itself. This has since been patched and the turns are a little quicker than before. Other titles in the franchise still lead in that department, however.  I'm getting too technical with this, so I'll make it brief.  Empire Total War is a great, and different kind of game in the Total War franchise. If you're looking for gunpowder, this is your game. If you're still too much into the clashing of swords and spears and cavalry, you will find it here, just not as much as you would in other TW games. This is the most modern iteration of the series and it is fantastic once you get the hang of it.  Gameplay: 8/10 - Playing the battles themselves is fantastic. I have to drop points for the campaign map, though, as it is a little bit crowded, but not enough to dull your experience - just a little patience is all that's needed.  Sound: 10/10 - I love hearing the noise of those muskets being reloaded and fired. It sounds terrific. If there's one thing Total War games do well, its capturing the most realistic war audio ever assembled in a video game.  Visuals: 10/10 - If you have a decent rig, you will see exactly why I gave it a 10. But even on a lower Shader Model, the game looks tremendous.  Overall: 9/10 - As I said, it's one of the more slower paced Total War games, in my books. Once you get passed the learning aspect, you will really enjoy this game.  And I highly recommend it
1032	1	a	+ Great story ! + Awesome art and characters ! + Great weapons and traps ! + hours of story  + The only tower of defence game i like &lt; trust me thats an achivement !  ------- IF YOU GRAB THIS BE SURE TO GET GOTY OR ALL DLC --------- without them its just a little less fun but all those are worth your money !
4369	1	a	The classic 'just 5 more minutes' game. You know, just 5 more minutes to take revenge on allied Prussia who broke our alliance and attacked my territory, then to eliminate all of the puppets who turned against me for taking revenge on Prussia. (No, it's never managed in 5 minutes)
172	1	a	Probably the best tower defence/trap defence game ever.
282	0	a	buy number orcs must die 2 if you want to join friends
955	1	a	Probably the most addicting game I have ever played, up there with Star Ocean 2. It's a combination tower defense/3rd person shooter, in which you kill thousands and thousands of Orcs, along with Ogres, Kobolds, Hellbats, etc. Best of all it's extremely cheap, and will give you countless hours of entertainment!
1435	1	a	One of the best Total War games of you like 18-19th century combat. Campaign opens for you literally the whole world except China and Asia, but you could still get to India. Do recomend, especially if you like building up an Empire, but when you have made one, it becomes a little bit borring as there is not many enemies which could challenge you and put under threat your existance.
3844	1	a	Its pretty good. You can shoot frenchies with old muskets
1465	1	a	great game
3149	1	a	Best turn based stratergy avalible to buy
382	1	a	A TD game with a FPS Element, slick controlls, fun houmor and great gameplay. Everything you want in a good TD/FPS combo.
2767	1	a	Aweosme game. Takes a while to understand it, but when you understand everything the game becomes very addictive.
509	1	a	actually amazing, I thought it might be basic garbage but the story is nice, the main character is fun, it feels really good to watch him get down when you get a perfect score, it is actually very well made and thought out and I loved it, some of the traps were stupid useless but all of them were pretty dam cool
1799	1	a	battle of the imperials - one of the best games
4227	1	a	i had only gotten this game on about 5 days ago and im already impressed.  it has some great historical background and nearly all the countries seem to be balanced.  i only have one problem with it and its that it doesn't have alot more countries. don't get me wrong, i like the countries the way they are but i would like to see some new countries be added to the fray in the next total war game.  maybe italy, germany, or even china idk.  overall, new favourite stratagy game 9/10
4213	1	a	Impressive game! One of my favourites ;)
1172	0	a	Personally I don't like Reincarnation much since they twisted the game so much and a lot of unbalanced stuffs happened, like the Imp, I always thought that Small Imps are 'tier 1' creatures like they had always been in D2 and the last 2 D3 versions. But not anymore, they are now nightmares for your all tier 1 troop which mostly have around 8 to 12 Accuracy while those Imps have 43 Invasion (you will miss - a lot), and 140 health and 33 damage and 30 Accuracy (they do CRIT a lot, almost all the time) and 28 Initiative... basically, you just can't win against them without using some spells. And some more things I don't like to mention here as it will be too long.
2072	1	a	I would play it all the time but i have a Mac and i have this computer from 2005 thats a windows computer so i am kinda â¥â¥â¥â¥ed.But i have already torrented the game before so i do reccomend it. (It was a sale for $3.74, i had to buy it).
1929	1	a	It is the best game ever played in the world i would totaly get this game if you have not buyed this game already i have been a total war fan for years and this is the best total war i ahve ever played :)
2357	1	a	yes, yes and yes a mustard try for any strategy gamer.
1801	1	a	This is a truely amazing game. Lots of great gameplay which can be repeated again and again and again. Throughly recommend to anyone.
1847	1	a	I think its a fun and very addictive game all though people are negative about it i think its a game that you should get. Its a good total war starter. I give it 5 stars
5141	1	a	It's fun, just buy it already. Worth every penny!
3810	1	a	Hey, how about a 2012 update, huh? I'm shocked at coming on Steam to see such low scores for a game I've owned for a long time now, that I adore. There is NO bugs, some of these reviews are absolutely outdated and unreliable. In my opinion, this is the most playable of all the Total War games. The tech branches are much more expansive and really do progress as time goes on and the campaign was fantastic. I felt like I was rewriting my text books. It's also one of the more colorful TW games, because it covers such an active century of domination and war. Napoleon felt sort of like a plus 20 year map pack to this gem. This game is just as good as any other TW game, it really is a shame that people wrote hundreds and hundreds of reviews within the first couple of months of the games release, yet when the game is 'Fixed' (Because I never played it when it was supposedly bugged) everyone just lose interest in lifting a finger for a new review. I'll simply put it this way, this game is worth every dollar, pound, or euro it costs.
4103	1	a	For most of the Total War Fanbase I've noticed for most people it's either their favorite or most hated,at least until ROME 2 came out.For me?Neither, my personel favorite is MED2 and my least favorite is SHOGUN2.While It's A great game in its own right poor A.I and a departure from 'old school' Total War games turned away many.When I first bought 2-3 years ago I had to force myself to play it and I never finshied a campagin about 1 year ago I found this game's modding community.While there are many great mods my favorite is Darthmod.It's for people like me who think while empire is great it could be a lot better.long story short if you're looking for a great unmodded 18 century game nappleon is the better choice but if you can learn to love it EMPIRE will become one of your most played steam games.
4622	1	a	an extremely addictive game with unique gameplay mechanics!
1267	1	a	This is a game about getting lost in infinity. It will be one of the scary and serious experiences you can have in your life.
1339	1	a	Enemies just run around in front of my firing lines, getting shot over and over again until they finally charge at me, problem is they have guns so why are they charging? 10/10
3353	1	a	This game is excellent. By far one of the best real time strategy games out there. The large campaign map, that covers the majority of the world, gives you hours of gameplay.  It was the first Total War game to incorporate real time naval battles and they did an excellent job. There is good variety of ships and is the only part of the game that makes cannons effective. Unfortunately the AI strategy is exactly to same, every time. Also, AI nations tend to build smaller, weaker ships whether they have the ability to build better ones or not.  Land battles are excellent. The game handles extremely well, especially when you consider that there are sometimes several thousand men on the field. The strategy of the AI varies but is generally somewhat predictable but is very true to actual military strategy of the time. Cannons are extrmely pointless and have very little power. A direct hit usually isn't enough to kill soldiers. Siege battles are somewhat glitchy. Soldiers tend to fire ineffectivley from walls and cannons are still worthless unless used on walls.  AI diplomacy is the worst part of this game. Nations will be opposed to a treaty and will suddenly change thier minds in your next turn. Their decisions have very little logic and do not persue diplomatic actions with the player very often.  Overall, it is an excellent game. It is a definite must have for any RTS collection.
654	1	a	Awesome tower defense game combined with a third person shooter. Super addicting!
2820	1	a	at first i didn't play because of the complexway it works. Then i rose to the challange and played on, discovering a great combanation of Turn based and real time RTS
3418	1	a	this game have a very epic scale of battle of the 18 centure
2589	1	a	Not as good as Rome or Medieval but still a great total war game 8/10
3371	1	a	Play this!
4232	1	a	I like this game, a lot
2612	1	a	after 800k kills on the battlefield and 70% of the achievements (the rest are MP) I can say it is a game to play, sadly alot of things were improved in Napoleon, but the size of the map and the number of regions in ETW makes this the best game ever, I allways hoped they would make expansions so that the 'Trading colonies' would become part of the actual map, sadly they never thought of doing so.  if you are into strategy games that can take almost forever by your own choice, this is the one to go for, especially if you can bother yourself to an .ESF editor for the purpose of changing the calender from 2 turns per year into 12 or whatever you want to do otherwise... then you can really just sit back and watch the world evolve if you feel like not taking part int the bid for power.   Best TW ever IMO. some things in Napoleon as I said were improved, graphics especially when it came to battles and cannon impacts etc. But also in the fact you could rebuild buildings instead of haveing to tear something else down and then build, their general recruitment and injury/recovery system was better IMO, the thing that saddened me was that the campaign map had shrunk although the world was technically even bigger than during the ETW time period of 1700-1799, by the 1805-1815's as in Napoleon TW, Most of Africa was colonized, most of South America was colonized AND the great western railway was only 17 years from its beginning of construction, ALL of North America would have been part of the game if it stood to me, Furthermore by the 1790's the British Empire had put alot of effort into the Chinese empire, which by then also should have been part of the game but wasn't.  Imo instead of a crummy little game like their newest game Total War: Atilla they should have made an Empire TW 2: The Global Empire, including everything from 1700 to 1850, including the 1770 discovery of 'Terra Australis' or well rediscovery as it ofcourse was :D IMO, they claim to be soo historically correct, but they are only up to the point that they can make their deadlines.
2478	1	a	'Total War' - It's another one, therefore amazing!
193	1	a	A Great Singlepayer Third Person Tower Defence, If that's what you're looking for and If that's not what you want then buy it anyways
1333	1	a	So addictive. The real-time warfare engine is the heart of this game, though. The sea battles, sieges, cavalry charges... You won't want to quit until you've taken over the whole world. Couple of hundred hours in and a couple of hundred more to go. Very hard to put down.
3915	1	a	Takes a long time between turns. Other than that, a good game.
517	1	a	Orcs must die is a tower defence game and third person shooter wrapped up into one.  The plot is as simple as it gets. There are two worlds, our world, and the orc world (insert warcraft joke here). They are connected by rifts, which allow travel between the two worlds, and for magic to flow into both worlds. An order has been set up to protect these rifts at all costs, using massive forts filled with traps to stem the hordes. You are a thick beefcake trained by the best old man the order had, before he died, it is your task to defend the rifts and keep back the hordes.  The meat of the game is wave based tower defence, where in you spend mana to set up defences along lanes in order to protect the rift from any nasties trying to get through. You yourself are loaded with weapons as well which allow you to take an active roll in the defence of the rift. You have a set amount of slots with which to select your tools of death and are locked into those until the end of the level. Weapons and traps both take up a single slot, so choose wisely.  Its a difficult but extremely satisfying process, going through each wave and being careful with how you plan everything out, from basic trap set up to the shooting mechanics, every enemy is dealt with in a slightly different way, with no true stratagy to perfectly stop the incoming hordes, you're always moving, always setting up new traps, always doing something. Its chaotic, but rarely overwhelming to the point where its impossible to handle right up until the end when you've failed to make the optimal trap set up somewhere or haven't been active enough in your own personal combat against the creeps.   Visually the game is very cartoonish, everything is very clean and it goes well with the cheesy comedy aspect, really hammering home the fact the game is light hearted, which is fine. The music scores, while not the greatest pieces, are memorable and even weeks later i can perfectly remember the main theme, i personally found them fantastic, but your tastes may differ.  The game overall was a wonderful experience from start to finish, being one of the most addictive games i've ever played in my life, and it was also the first game i ever played on PC, forever bringing me into the folds of the PC master race. I whole heartedly recommend this game to anyone looking for a fast paced tower defence game, or third person shooter with heavy focus on not doing all the work by yourself.
4258	1	a	Very good game and very good linux support
4192	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ i didnt play this 
4425	1	a	This game stole 16 days of my life.
3540	0	a	The text is ridiculously small and blurry. It makes the game close to unplayable and just very unenjoyable. Waste of money.
782	1	a	This game is incredible!! Tower defense + realtime action + comedic humor = HOURS of great mindless entertainment. Highly recommend this to anyone!!
4470	1	a	Great Game! needs to go on sale more, i have alot of friends who want to play but they dont have the money! lol bills, you know how it is ;)
2026	1	a	Played as Maratha Confederacy (Present day India)  Went to War against Ottoman Empire (Present day Turkey)  Charged the Ottoman Empire with my Elephant Calvary   Got decimated by 64-Lb artillery  10/10 would get shelled again
2085	1	a	This Game can really give you a headache on what your thinking of doing saying that theres enemys allies and many features you can use in this game of total warfare
2581	1	a	Empire: Total War is a very good strategy based game. The campaign is set up like a board map, with options for you to simulate or play in the battles. The senarios are pretty fun, but can be challenging depending on the difficulty the game is set on. The 'Play Battle' game modes are what I have spent most of my time playing and those have kept me happy with the game. The graphics are decent and the sound effects are alright and there is virtually no lag what so ever. I would recommend this game if you like playing long battles, thinking like you are playing chess, or have a love for strategy based games in general.
4268	1	a	Few bugs here and there but still a great conquest and strategy game
268	0	a	Definitely not one I'll play very often; but then I'm more about startegy &amp; tactics than brute force.
4702	1	a	Great time killer and great addition to your collection. Grab on a sale. Fun to cruize around space and blow â¥â¥â¥â¥ up as well as upgrade your ships and items. I have been gaming for about 20 years +. This game would make my top 100. 6/10 (no game is perfect).
225	1	a	Theese
3594	1	a	I have spent a lot of time on this game 10 out of 10
4710	1	a	Awesome music themes and atmosphere. Nice tech progression and customizable weapons.  Very fun. SPAZ2 out hopefully this year - sweeet
2450	1	a	lots of people say this is the weakest game in the total war collection, and they are wrong i for one loved it. :)
3716	1	a	A game where you get to do what politicians do for a living, engage in trade, steal others' research, then start wars over various differences between your countries (read as empires)
2971	0	a	not worth it
4784	1	a	A bit of slow start but after about an hour or two it really picks up. Plenty of ships to choose from and the customization is good. The leveling system is a little poor, though. The farther you get in an upgrade tree, the more level-ups will be required to acquire a single upgrade.
4169	1	a	This game for me was, paradoxically, one of the best and worst Total War games. Perhaps this is because I have played so much of this title, I've had a chance to see all the best and worst parts of it. I love the time period and trans-continental features of this game, as well as the introduction of the naval battles to Total War. However, numerous small bugs and missed opportunities for improvement throughout the game, which could easily have been fixed if the game hadn't been rushed to realease so quickly, linger on and multiply to detract greatly from what could have been the best Total War game of all time.  Sadly, I find the vanilla game to be essentially unplayable due to the numerous issues and inaccuracies. However, with the addition of Darthmod (which you can find on the Total War Centre forums), you'll be able to experience a decent improvement in gameplay, but perhaps only a fraction of what the game could have become if the development had not been so rushed.  This title had so much potential, but the lack of development meant an unfinished game was released. Mods have partially offset this issue, but I can't help but imagine how amazing this game could have been if more effort was invested during development. I still recommend this game, dispite it's faults, as with Darthmod it is really a game worth having.
713	1	a	9 out of 10. It took me about 12 hours to get through the 18 map campaign, and I've spent at least another 12 going back and replaying the levels to try to get more achievements and better level scores. Each map probalby takes 10 minutes to play. You run around setting up traps (kind of tower defense-like) to kill the orcs, kobolds and ogres as they try to make their way through the map from the gate to your rift. You have weapons as spells for direct combat. It's fun to see if you can build the best configuration of traps to stop all the monsters. Single player only. Very stable, I only noticed one very minor bug with a monster getting stuck in lava and not dieing, but I was able to work around it. The character you play is very humorous in the things he says and does, as are the orcs.
3284	1	a	lazy on creative assemblies part, they rushed it and campaign AI is stupid, BUY only if you are a total war fan and if its under 20 dollars. still lots of hours played but the game ALWAYS crashes after turn 180.. etc they never fixed it, still fun and spent hours playing
830	1	a	If you are a fan of tower defense, third person shooting, headshots, and Orcs then this is a must buy. Also look into the sequel.
2952	1	a	one of the best games out there involving the american revolution, besides assassins creed 3. totally recomend it for everyone interested in hstory strategy based games.
197	1	a	Wow, the tower defense titles these days actually improve on what is already a fun game genre. In Orcs Must Die you control a warmage, in third person view. So instead of building traps in an isometric sort of view, you now run around setting up traps and actively killing enemies with your character. There's never a dull moment and the fact that you gain new traps after finishing a level gives incentive to keep playing. You'll want to come back for more, it's THAT fun. Other than that, the game mechanics are pretty much the same as any other tower defense game; you kill enemies, earn cash, upgrade traps, and try to prevent enemies from taking over your rifts. Only downside, in my opinion, is that it's a single-player affair. I'm sure it would've been more fun when played in co-op mode but maybe that's something for the sequel. Don't let that stop you from buying it though !  [Rating: 87/100]
1598	1	a	Absolutley Great Game, the strategy, the Maps, it acutally teaches you how to read a European Map, Amazing game. Prussia is the Best Faction
730	1	a	This game is amazingly addicting. Fast paced castle defense and shooter mix-up kind of thing. It's a unique blend of awesome.
569	1	a	Cool Indie game :D 7/10 Stars *******
1700	1	a	the best game in his category ever... the first and best of naval battles...a massive campaign map....an extraordinary battle graphic machine...BestGame 2009'2010
4239	1	a	So much to say about this game. Now, I am inexperienced when it comes to the Total War series, this being my first one. Let me tell you, if you enjoy firing mortars into native American tribes, then this game might be for you. That is if your mortars ever hit them. This game is fun, especially when all of your men decide to go from 'confident' and 'eager' to 'Shattered' or 'broken' in a split second. final rating, 1776/1776
669	1	a	Fun game, average graphics; from me 7/10.
971	1	a	An awesome take on the tower defense genre, and challenging to boot. The graphics are decent, the gameplay is solid, and the traps are fun.
357	1	a	With a sequel on its way, giving the first a play is a must, tower defense, with a first person twist, presented with PERFECTION, bloody good game =D
5182	1	a	Surprisingly this is a very good indie game, one of the best I've played.  This is a real-time space shooter game that has some RPG and strategy elements in it. Combined together, it is actually a very addictive game that keeps you playing. You can have a fleet of up to 4 ships, and with it you gather resources, unlock new ships and technology, level up for talent points, trade with the 2 factions in the game to become more powerful. You can help or hinder either of the two factions, and the number of ships they can field in battle will increase or decrease, making your actions influence the galaxy.  The graphics, sound and story are decent enough, but the game-play is top notch.  As of this recommendation, the game is good enough despite being simple. But it could be so much more and the developers plan to add more content. If you have some spare change, consider buying it during a sale and help fund the sequel, SPAZ 2.
1402	1	a	Great game one of the best strategy games ive ever played.
611	1	a	Awesome FPS/TD game. Like Dungeon Defenders, but less monotonous (but also only one-player)
2675	1	a	As long as you download A Proper Empire Terra Incognita, the game works great but then later on you might encounter your game crashing during a startup loading game screen but other than that I like this game.
4554	1	a	Never thought Ill have 47 hours on record on an Indie game, but everything was just marvelous about this game, from Dabbing to Graphics, I cant wait for the release of S.P.A.Z. 2. Awsome game.
1928	1	a	Empire is a great game, yes the in-game graphics have problems when you are not zoomed in close enough, yes there are various dissapointments but you ENJOY it. If you you enjoy playing it, don't whine about it's issues, have fun. I especially enjoyed playing the road to independance campaigns and aybody who enjoys RTS should have fun playing this.
4102	1	a	This was my introduction into the series and for me was pretty awesome. I played my first campaign on easy and literally wiped out the world. This is a decent mixture of Guns and Melee. If you prefer Guns and line firing go onto Napoleon if you like melee get Medievel, Attila or my favorites Shogun Rise of the Samurai or Rome 2. If you're into Grand Campaigns than this is it for you...out of all the games it has my favorite campaign because it has almost the entire world for you to conquer.
3101	1	a	THIS GAME IS ASWOME
4274	1	a	PROS: Its a fun time killer and can be historical at times Rewrite history United Provinces Scotland Ireland Grenadiers United States Realistic Diplomacy (to an extent) Fun and engaging Real Time battles on land AND sea Plenty of countries to free from tyranny Wide range of units to use in battle Wide range of technology to gain an advantage over the enemy Wide range of mods to make the game better Three theaters of war Ship AI better than infantry AI Not too expensive. Pikemen DLCs add new troops which adds new fun Online play  CONS: Stupid AI â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ AI Mughal Empire Melee combat is completely one sided Melee combat can take a long time (I actually fell asleep for two hours while playing this game and my army was in Melee combat. I awoke and my army was still in melee) Real easy to go bankrupt Religion not a big factor Brigs can't beat Galleys. Brigs cant beat anything. Can't retrieve sailors in the water during ship battles DLCs cost money Online play is terrible Historically inaccurate  RATING: 9/10 Will continue to play!
2994	1	a	brilliant game, although that may be because of my love for those times. i like that you have to research tech to advance from standard gameplay to a truely powerful nation and end up ruling the world.
2625	1	a	For me it was a very enjoyable introduction to the Total War series. It encouraged me to go on to buy Shogun 2, Rome and Napoleon.  Give it a try :)
1926	1	a	This game is â¥â¥â¥â¥ING AWESOME!
642	1	a	DEff one of the best indie games ive played this year!!!
4253	1	a	True grand strategy, spans a massive map from the Americas to Europe to India. With darts mod battles are exciting and with tactical depth.
2338	1	a	The game is fun, however, there are many bugs in this game and in other total war games. This is absolutely ridiculous and unprofessional to continue producing games that have the same issues. It shows a lack of integrity as a business and as a leading game producer. You probably justify it by saying that you're company is economically driven, you produce games knowing that they have serious issues but are still 'playable' because you can.... Seriously... fix the games, more specifically the choppiness.
4246	1	a	Great game. All the bugs are fixed, great variety of mods and so many options in the grand campaign.
2058	1	a	'Thus begins my dominatening!'- Demoman
479	1	a	For The Following People Who Is Not A Tower Deffence Game Fan Then Don't Bother Being Negative Because People Like Me Are Fans Of Tower Deffence Games And It Mkaes Me Mad When People Thinks Its â¥â¥â¥â¥ But Clearly They Are Not TD Fans So Grow Up And Move On  I Understand Its Your Opinion Everyone Is Aloud An Opinion But Your Only Saying Your Reasons From Your Perspective
1468	1	a	This game is one of the most popular and most addiction yet,Well..,For me Of course!
3936	1	a	another great total war game !
2435	1	a	Fire and Charge....... YOU CAN'T GO WRONG!!
3037	1	a	Please fix the graphic optimization CA, this is one of the best Total War's to date!
3427	1	a	This game is by far one of the best Total wars games they have made. Filled with a gribing campaign and story line. It will trap you for hours a upon ended
1566	1	a	An amazing turned based strategy game with a mixture of real time combat. Taking place in 1700's Europe, you take the role as one of the major empires of the period. Make your choice, and rewrite the course of history! If you enjoy managing an empire, while being a field general leading your nation to glory, then this game is for you!
2966	1	a	A note: I've only played singleplayer, and usually just the grand campaign.  I enjoy this game greatly, but it is not without its flaws. Unless you're an avid fan of 18th century history or feel you must own every Total War game, I would recommend holding off on purchasing this title until it's on sale.  Pros: You get to pick a nation in 1700 and do whatever you want. Yes, there are campaign objectives set for either 1750 or 1800 depending on your settings, but there's no real penalty to not completing these apart from a 'you lose' screen at the deadline. Win or lose, the game allows you to play beyond the deadline if you wish to, although line infantry and wooden sailing ships in the mid 1900s would seem a bit odd. You can try to follow your nation's historical path (like being the Russian empire and Pushing the Swedes out of Ingria), or depart from history completely (like conquering the entire Indian subcontinent as Prussia).  Cons: The AI. Its performance can be both a source of amusement and frustration. Pathfinding, for example, can be quite irritating, as you watch your grenadiers struggle with their greatest foe: the doorway. Likewise the game covers up some of the enemy AI shortcomings by giving your opponents advantages. Their general will run away the minute you select any unit to attack him (especially noticable when you attack with artillery, as his Spidey Sense goes off before the first cannonball is even fired). You must be ever watchful for friendly fire, while opponents can launch mortars into their own ranks without so much as a scratch. Seemingly poor nations weild armies that should bankrupt them, but somehow they stay afloat, and absurd trade offers are the norm (200 gold for my most valuable region? No. No, thank you). Apart from the occasional corrupted save (maybe one in every 20 campaigns), I haven't encountered any game-breaking bugs.  Some other points: The game offers different government types and revolutions. Do you want to rule your empire with an iron fist as a monarch, suppressing any unrest with your military, or would you rather embrace Enlightenment ideals and side with the populace in creating a free republic? Each system has its own advantages and drawbacks, both internally and on the diplomatic stage. Combat, naturally, is one of the main focuses of the game, with real-time fighting taking place whenever two opposing armies or navies meet. You can choose to hold a line and bombard your foes with artillery, fix bayonets and scale enemy city walls, or move cavalry along a flank and charge with cold steel (and many other tactics and combinations). Researching technology unlocks more powerful units and abilities, allowing you to dominate the battlefield. Each nation speaks its native language instead of accented English, which is always a nice touch. All factions also have their own unique units, though some have more than others (looking at you, Britain). DLCs help this a little, but mods are the way to go if you really want a wide variety of regiments at your service.  Anyhow, those are my thoughts on the title. I enjoy the game a lot, but it is certainly not perfect.
1141	1	a	It's like a tower defense, but you play it as a third person game. You still build up various types of defensive mechanisms that help you prevent the enemy from getting to your base. It feels fresh and innovative, while not consuming too much of your time if you don't want it to. Good for a simple time passer or playing for a long time.
620	1	a	First Person 'Trap' Defense at its finest. Slaying hordes of orcs is so much fun. 8/10
202	1	a	Addictive.
3291	1	a	Solid game. Love the firearm combat, and the ship battles are epic. Very nice looking graphics too. Must have for any total war/strategy fan.
4565	1	a	There was, once upon a time, back in the earliest days of MMORPG's a game that went by the name of Diaspora. It was a simple yet highly addictive space battle and trading game, made by a very small team of coders. Guilds were formed, alliances made, â¥â¥â¥â¥ was flung, and all in a small java based applet of 2D glory.  Now we have S.P.A.Z; a single player game of space battles and trading with RPG elements. Very addictive, very funny, very shiny, and above all else, very Indie; made by a team of 2 people. So Diaspora for the modern day but without the multiplayer aspect and yet just as fantastic.  9/10
598	1	a	This is an awesome game!!!! MUST HAVE!!! 
2575	1	a	A great game that has been around for a while! Starting out in the 1700's, you choose a nation from around the world to be in charge of. From there, you upgrade your military, industries and knowledge via education as you try and stay ahead of the rest of the planet while increasing the size of your empire by conquering other nations and their territories.  Use the world map to make major moves. Decide battles automatically or actually go into the fight and direct the whole thing! Great graphics either way.  Raise money through taxes or by selling knowledge to foreign countries.   Hours of play-time.
3431	1	a	this game is one of the best i have ever played i bought it ages ago and am still playing now when ever i get the chance its brilliant
3143	1	a	Empire war is a fantastic game.  buy it.
2750	1	a	This is the most realistic total war game available to date. Able to utilize land armies as well as naval warfare to protect your all important trade routes. I would like to see the developers create a WWII- Total War.
1088	1	a	+nice graphics &amp; art style +well optimised and constant frame rate +simple game premise well executed +cheap +can fling orcs onto spears to impale them +replay value - trying different tactics   -repetitive
661	1	a	Great blend of FPS and tower defense with fast paced fragging and some good laughs. Two thumbs up!
3402	1	a	Great game, challenging as some nations, but fun at the same time. Many people playing on multiplayer
4255	1	a	&gt;defends fort against Ottoman empire (renforced by Persia) with 3 regiments. &gt;Gives names Iron cross the fearless, Iron heart the brave, and Iron shot the accurate for their feats in battle. &gt;general dies mid skirmish &gt;iron cross the fearless is first to break 11/10 would fight for Istanbul again.  P.s. get darthmod to make this playable.
85	1	a	The most fun you can have without signing a waiver.
2299	1	a	It really awesome and cool
5069	1	a	Dumb amounts of fun.
2504	1	a	Shows how the great powers of Europe used imperialism to expand
1254	1	a	Addictive and deceptively tough little Tower Defence game. One of the top 3 TD games I've played. Well worth the price.
5064	1	a	Space. Pirates. Zombies. Can't go wrong with this one.
4467	1	a	The 'Test of Time' game. As good as it was in 2005.
1515	1	a	The game offers a substantial amount of content, however the product is in all ways underwhelming. It is quite obvious that the game had much more potential that was left uncapitalized on. Having played both Empire and Napoleon Total War, it is apparent that Empire would have, could have, and should have had the overall polish and refinement of battlefield controls that were found in Napoleon. As a whole, both games are rather enjoyable, however I would suggest Napoleon Total War instead, for fans who are significantly more interested in the battlefield experience.
767	1	a	This is by far one of the most entertaining mindless games I've played for a very long time. I feel like a warning to new players is in order, your fingers will hurt if you mash the attack button to much. Once you got a general feel for the game and only aimed at their heads the game was much more bareable.  Mainly comedy and random orc genocide all in one game.
3812	1	a	I enjoyed playing as Prussia in the world domination play thru. lot of different kinds of soldiers tho choose from, when i bought it in 2009 it had so many bugs, a few years and patches {as well as a new computer}later perfect in my eyes Enjoy!!!!
4231	1	a	Total War has been around for a long time. Empire Total War seperates itself from the rest. I still think this might be the best total war game out there. Only other version of total war that comes close to beating this game is Shogun 2. Empire is 6 years old and still amazing!
4353	1	a	Empire Total War... Europe War with Battle Ships and Guns powder
4023	1	a	My overall favorite total war... Better then napoleon
3203	1	a	Great game with lot of fun.
980	1	a	Very fun game, with a nice sense of humor and a good amount of challenge. Very reccomendable.
3205	1	a	After the patches the game is very good but it still has some bugs and the campaign isn't the best. I find it better than Napoleon Total War. If you like the era and can live with some bugs buy it.  7/10
4043	1	a	its a well-made game with good developers.The graphics are real life.Thank you Empire Total War 
700	1	a	Similar to Dungeon Defenders but not a grindfest, no item drops or multiplayer either, but the gameplay itself is much more fun, interesting, and challenging in the right ways. The traps/upgrades are creative and diverse enough to allow for tons of different ways to conquer each level. The sequel is gonna have co-op.
4601	1	a	If you loved the space shooter games of yore then this is a dream come true! Customize your own fleet, purchase new tech, ally or betray two factions and prepare for a massive galatic zombie infestion!
1229	1	a	I like this game. Gave me a good 'coffee and wakeup-game' experience. A few missions are damn hard, but not too hard, just like a good Tower game should be. I just wish there was more missions. I'd love some DLC here. Cheap and good, go for it.
4698	1	a	You absolutely must buy this game. It's better than Ring Runner and certainly better than Galactic Arms Race. It's exactly what it sounds like, and so it's a bit to add much to the description. The mission variety is excellent as it combines storyline, side missions, and procedural mission generation. The universe is also procedurally generated so theres even some variety to the main storyline missions, resulting in excellent replayability.  I bought this with credit gained from selling Steam trading cards when it was on sale for $2. Not sure why I hadn't seen this game earlier.
3424	1	a	This game is amazing, and even more so with the mod DarthMod. During the next sale for the Total war games I reccomend you get it! Also, even when it's not on sale it's still cheap at 15 bucks. 15 bucks for hundreds of hours worth of content sounds good to me ^-^
2782	1	a	Fun game but a little buggy
4060	1	a	Great game, easily lose hours into playing a campaign.
4313	1	a	The 18th Century was the beggining of the modern era. Guns took over, massive empires were forged, natives got screwed out of their futures. All around good times. For a Total War game, it's good, with some caveats. AI is either dumb, or cheating in battles, especially your troops AI. Friendly fire is all too common, and you sometime lose more troops from that then enemy fire. Siege battles are a joke, and troops are pretty glitchy while using fortifications. Also, do not auto-resolve battles, you will lose many more troops then you need to, especially in naval battles.  rating 8/10, would wait for a sale thou
2278	0	a	&gt;Grew up in Maryland &gt;'Chief Cheesepeake'  DONE. COMPLETELY DONE. The game killed all enjoyment in the FIRST mission. I may come back someday, if I can brave the ugly menus and wonky game balance; but most likely, I will probably just stick with Civ5. To be honest, I never really did 'get' the Total War series. It seems to me like a 'love it or hate it' kind of thing. My understanding of the inner nuances of the gameplay is you take your guys and you run them into the other guys. That said, the only chance this game had would have been to wow me with some great atmosphere and immersiveness. If you can't even spell 'Chesapeake' right, I'm not immersed.  Anyway..2/10  PS: I want to again stress that I am not a Total War fan. You may or may not be. If you've never played a Total War before, I suggest downloading the demo first.
5135	1	a	Best RPG/Semi RTS I have Played in a long time recommend for people wanting to Blow Sh*t up in space
3543	1	a	I can never get enough of this game, although I wish there were more options in deplomacy, this game is great!!
2884	1	a	Do I like it? Sure. This is more of a criticism of the people behind the Total War Series as a whole. Why has Total War: Attila, Napoleon, Rome II got pretty much the same graphics? You don't seem to have improved your gameplay, what's more you implelemted a for profit scheme as in the newer titles like Attila we have to buy segments of the game in DLCs. So we can only play a small selection of factions, while the others remain locked because you download all the other not bought DLCs anyway, just waiting for us to buy them.
4222	1	a	The only gripe I have with this game is the utter nonsense written about the right to keep and bear arms (in the description for the minutemen units). As an American, when I saw that I almost lost myself in a patriotic rage, and felt a responsibility to inform the gamers who may view that nonsense of the following: Clearly whoever wrote that into the unit description doesnât understand the historical context behind the 2nd amendment, nor what a militia is, so I will provide the viewers here with some quotes from our founders. Note, the second amendment states the following: âA well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringedâ.   'I ask, Sir, what is the militia? It is the whole people. To disarm the people is the best and most effectual way to enslave them.' -George Mason-  'A militia, when properly formed, are in fact the people themselves â¦' -Richard Henry Lee-  'And that the said Constitution be never construed to authorize Congress to infringe the just liberty of the Press, or the rights of Conscience; or to prevent the people of the United States, who are peaceable citizens, from keeping their own arms; â¦' Samuel Adams  Other than that, I had some fun playing the game but I quickly got board of the repetitive battles like all other total war games, plus the map mode was buggy as all hell and had horrible framerate problems. All in all would I recommend this? I guess so....
1797	1	a	From time to time, I still find myself coming back to Empire Total War. I just love the naval battles. =)
2377	1	a	Awesome game, can be annoying sometimes due to bugs and awkward behaviour of units, but at the end of the day it's tremendously fun.
4855	1	a	This game could have been called Starscape 2 (see my review on Starscape, If you have played Space Rangers its also like a much better version of that game). Its very much similiar except quite a bit better. First of all you get 2 NPC ships that fight along side you which you can switch between. Second if you get stuck you can fly around to different areas and try to get better equip. They try to keep your direction open unless you want to advance the story, then you must accomplish certain tasks. Also requires salvage to unlock ships which is a neat idea. A bloody shame its only single player. This game is worth up to 10 dollars. If its 5 bucks don't miss it. On a side note the game was actually made by only 2 guys which is amazing.
2483	1	a	Sometimes, in a first person shooter, your bloodthirst isn't quite quenched. There are those frustrating days when you can't hit â¥â¥â¥â¥. Those are the days when you need to play this game. After all, what better way to get revenge on that annoyingly accurate british guy on that game server than to lead 1,000 Native American warriors to chop 120 British scalps off? 11/10
480	1	a	Love the game. Keep up the good work :)
2896	1	a	1 of the best Total War Games that I have ever played. With a great skirmish mode and an infuriating campaign. Accidently got George Washington killed before the creation of the United States, but then I had a Wizard raise him from the dead, so everything is ok.   9/10
76	1	a	This was my first steam game! And its good.
44	1	a	a nice little tower defense game with lots of gibs! only thing bad is no co-op.
35	1	a	I have very fond memories of this funny and polished third-person tower defense game. Slaughtering orcs, trolls, goblins, and other mobs is hugely satisfying, especially when racking up combos and abusing skill trees and environmental traps.  The game's only flaw is that the hardest difficulty, Nightmare mode, is a bit on the unfun side, as it immediately starts all attack waves automatically, removing the element of careful planning. If you're a completionist aiming to 5-star every level, be prepared for the tedium of restarting every single level dozens and dozens of times from scratch until that one magical run where nothing goes wrong.  Aside from that, highly recommended game. If you've never played Orcs Must Die 2, get this one on sale and play it first, and see if you get as hooked as I did.
1281	1	a	This is the soul of video games right here: one man doing all the artwork, music, and programming for a game. It's how the industry began! The result in this case is something more unique than most corporate-funded teams would ever think of, much less dare to release.  Ever seen the movie 'Existenz'? Don't. It's silly. See 'The Thirteenth Floor' instead. It's way better. Anyway, both movies tackle the idea of recursive realities. Inside a Star-Filled Sky puts CONTROL of that concept at the core of a gaming experience. That enemy's too tough? Enter him, dumb-down his abilities, exit, then waste him with ease. Alternatively, enter yourself, learn Kung Fu, exit, then waste him with ease.  Jason Rohrer has made a game that's thought-provoking, moderately mind-bending ('What was I trying to do again? And which level of reality IS this?!'), a good bit of pixelphilic fun, and simply worth your money. If nothing else, I admire his proper use of hyphenation. Support literate games!
2802	0	a	One of the two worst Total War games ever made (along with Rome 2). AI totally broken. Buy Napoleon instead.
776	1	a	This game is a super fun hack-and-slash and easily runs! There's not even a storyline to get in the way.
4225	1	a	Why do you need to lean about Social Studies in North America when you have this game?
1044	1	a	If you can pick this up cheap, its worth a weekend of fun. 3rd person shooter with Tower Defense style gameplay. Set traps and use them to stop the horde from comming through.
4966	1	a	i've played through this game twice, one normally and a second when i discoverd this game had a farily active modding community and loved every bit of them, 8.5/10.
4882	1	a	Amazing game! Very addictive! Definitely worth your money and time!
1889	1	a	Put a few minutes in it, it's pretty good
3374	1	a	This was the most Meh! game in the Total War series so far. Design decisions, like showing bullet paths, though understandable in their incorporation, took a lot out the battle immersion. I also was not crazy about the map being button split into the new world and the old world. I found this to be enough of a hassle that I basically ignored the new world in my playthroughs. Having said that, I picked it up with all the expansions and DLC from Steam for a song a while back and to be fair I have not played it since the original vanilla version. 7/10 for now. May change when I get a chance to play the full version and Napoleon.
4031	1	a	A genuine masterpiece, its historical accuracy appealed to me. I enjoyed its time setting which is around when many of the great european powers founded their empires. Overall an exemplary which truely deserves to be part of the Total war series.
3404	1	a	Another great addition to the Total War franchise. With three maps (called 'theatres') used at once, and a time period spanning 1700 to 1825, this is a great 18th century stategy game.  9.5/10
4492	1	a	While I'm a bit late into the game of reviewing SPAZ, writing it anyway couldn't hurt. Space Pirates and Zombies is a action-strategy space shooter with elements of random generation. While you have some control over how random it is, it only serves to increase or decrease the difficulty in the long run.  Gameplay: The gameplay is pretty solid. You pilot your ship around with WASD keys, and shooting your weaponry with the mouse. What makes it special if that you don't point and shoot, but the direction of your ship controls where your shots are. If you place a weapon on the front of your ship, expect it to shoot forward until the higher class ships which have rotating turret mounts that do just that. Even then, anything other than lasers will still need to lead the target, as nothing is hitscan. This makes shooting more skill based.  At the same time, you have to pilot your ship to avoid incoming shots from enemy ships. This ends up leading to dog fight type scenarios where you and your opponent are dodging around each other trying to get a shot in. This is where a lot of the enjoyment of the game is, since a lot of battles will be decided on whether or not you can out-maneuver the AI, especially on higher difficulties when the enemies become too strong to kill in a head-on fight.  As you kill enemies, you can pick up orbs of Data to level up and gain research points. The tech tree is nothing complex, since it is mostly just a direct % increase in damage and other stats for each weapon or ship subsystem. This is however needed, since more powerful versions of equipment are unusable until you level up that system. But before you can even equip something, you must acquire the blueprints of each item. Naturally, higher level equipment requires more blueprints, which can be obtained by the faction bases. Either buy from them, or blow it up and loot the charred remains of the base, if you can.  The Bounty Hunter system adds in some extra challenge to the mix, if you choose to allow them to spawn. Killing enemies within their territory increases the bounty on your head. Eventually, if left unchecked, the hunters will come after you in an attempt to collect that bounty. The higher your bounty, the higher the chance. You also have the chance to be extorted on the way out of one of their systems. Failure to pay and you'll need to fight them off. You'd think this would increase your bounty further, but instead gives you respect, which lowers the bounty. If the bounty falls into the negative, you start to gain respect points. This acts as a buffer before you will start accumulating a bounty, and ensures you won't be attacked until you drain all of your respect.   Another way to gain respect, as well as money and Data, is to fight in arena matches set up by the hunters. As you progress, harder challenges are unlocked, each with 3 difficulties. If you want to avoid ambushes every are or two, you may want to take advantages of these arena matches. They can even be repeated for a lesser reward if you are out of fresh fights. And if you really have no other option, you can pay your bounty off yourself. As a whole, this system adds more challenge to the game, which is welcome when not playing on the highest difficulty.  There's much more to gameplay, but I don't wish to drag on. So I'll end with one major flaw I found, and that mostly comes with the late game. If you fail to kill one of the smallest ships but weakened it to critical health, it will flee. For several thousand feet. If you don't switch to a small ship of your own that is just as fast, it will get away, and you'll spend minutes at a time waiting for it to come back. This becomes a huge pace breaker, and sometimes even causes you to be put in more difficult situations in the late game, when enemies can spawn just by you staying in an area for long. Maybe if they would retreat from battle, leaving the area entirely, this wouldn't be an issue.  Story: The setting is that of a far future, and space travel has advanced to that of colonizing other star systems. This is mostly thanks to the currency of the game, Rez. This subtance is mined from deposits floating in space to craft vessels. In order to become rich, many set off to mining colonies to gather as much Rez as they can. Legend also has it, there is a grand deposit in the center of the universe. This deposit is what our protagonists are looking for. The only problem is getting there. Warp gates between star systems are guarded by the UTA, the police space force, essentially. Not only this, but the grand warp gates to the planets near the center are locked down tight. A nice twist comes in the zombie part of the title, which you discover upon finally reaching these center systems. I'd elaborate, but I don't wish to spoil it.  Graphics: I care very little for graphics as long as they are serviceable. Meanwhile, SPAZ has great graphics. Each ship looks nice, if simple at times, and the lighting is bright and colorful.  Sound: The music of the game mostly boils down to ambient noise, but there are a few tracks here or there that are enjoyable. Cutscenes are also narrated by TotalBiscuit, who does a fine enough job. Though even he says he did terribly, and it is clear enough that he could have done better if he tried. The sound effects are all well and good, meanwhile. Each weapon has its own shot sound effects, and the sounds of another ship being hit are clear to hear. But after awhile, hearing the pew pew pews of the game gets old.  Overall, the game is a terrific time. It serves as a challenge when it needs to, and is just pure fun to shoot stuff in space. I'd recommend this to anyone who thinks they might enjoy this when shown any gameplay.
1828	1	a	Nice game, extraordinary war simulation battles and great recreation on units. I recomend this game to anyone that likes strategy games based on history.
1510	0	a	I've tried to justify this game in my head so many times, but I've reached my limit; Empire: Total War is complete garbage. There's a fantastic game hidden deep beneath the countless bugs, but these bugs are so game-ruining that even after six years Empire feels like it's unfinished and still in development. The A.I is ridiculously poor, during sieges the infantry refuse to shoot, or cannons knock down their own walls, and if the computer is the attacking faction the game seems to know that the A.I won't be able to attack on its own, so it cheats. I've started sieges with sections of my walls already knocked down, and sometimes the enemy need only come into close proximity of my gates for the computer to unlock them for the A.I. More often than not the infantry units simply walk around the map, allowing themselves to be killed or routed. I've installed one or two mods to help with the A.I, which has improved it slightly, but sieges still remain horrible affairs, with soldiers trying to shoot through walls, or even killing men on their own team. The combat aspect of this game is utterly broken, and considering that this is the crux of Empire's gameplay it leaves me to wonder why it has such glowing reviews.
1549	1	a	very very good campagin and sea battles land batlles could be better but over all a great game
1531	1	a	I intend to continue to play this game, being ex matelot. Possibly find the best way to fight other better eqiuped ships using different ships. i have been using fifth class for now and seem to be doing well. The land forces are a bit difficult but willingly I will test them differently. I will get back later  ARNY of HORSEFAIR
2243	0	a	This game looked so good, but it kept crashing. In the end i had to refund ;( sorry developers
2667	1	a	best game every 
4400	1	a	If, like me, you are partial to history, especially the history of the Age of Limited Warfare, then Empire: Total War is the perfect game for you. There is immense amusement to be made, re-writing the history of Europe, and the game world has a wonderful periphery, in which all manner of delightful and unexpected things happen, like the Pope conquering the Ottoman Empire. It manages to be an excellent strategy game, with levels of increasing complexity for those who would delve into them, but also a simple interface, and wonderfully easy, shallower format that allows someone to ease into the game. I would highly recommend this to any fan of the 18th Century, or any fan of the Total War games.
4005	1	a	Evil white man simulator 2009
1792	1	a	Just install darthmod and you should be fine.
1241	1	a	A good, if dull, tower defense game. Doesn't really have it's own style, which is where Plants vs Zombies really thrived, and even Defense Grid had a bit with the robot narator, but nothing here. Regardless, good TD game that is only $5, and I have not completed both campaigns yet and have logged on 8+ hours so far. Seems like a good rate to me.
753	1	a	  Strategy with action!
3452	1	a	This is a game that requires an interest in the mechanics to progress it - with literally no story, you have to create your own or sustain yourself with the tactical aspect. I, personally, perform the latter admirably: this game fascinates me as conducting a large scale conflict with as much grace as possible can. If you have a thirst for colonial expansion and a taste for military formations and movements, this is a game for you.
2804	1	a	Empire total war is a complete disaster. However once you add Darthmod version 8.0 it becomes not only playable but enjoyable. My only gripe is the lack of MP in darthmod which unless you have friends you will not see much of. To enable higher graphics you may also have to look up a quick tutorial on how to change the code log. Once you put some moding and enable some features the game is actualy wonderful. DO NOT BUY IF YOU ARE NOT GOING TO MOD THIS GAME IT IS TERRIBLE VANILLA.
3633	1	a	Much fun for many hours ruling the world.
2093	1	a	really fun game if u like historic battles like this
4563	1	a	An excellent game that is incredibly addicting. Well worth the price tag, and a must have. A simple game to play that is just loads of fun and easily spend the hours away playing. 9/10
635	1	a	Not bad, about 10 hours of campaign game play in it.
3741	0	a	Doesn't seem to work for me. I use Linux.
2731	1	a	Solid game, would rather play EU-IV, though.
934	1	a	Not since Lemmings has a game so seamlessly mixed engaging mechanics, humor, cuteness, and gleeful cruelty.â 90/100 â PCGamer   I AGREE!
4573	1	a	when I had this game I really loved it during the time that it was free, but when the free time ran out I was very dissapointed to find the I had to end up paying for it. Maybe another like one free day sale but hvae me not ever having to pay for it.  Besids all that, Its a really great game :D
664	1	a	Ostensibly a Tower Defense game, Orcs Must Die is a downright fantastic take on the genre. With an art style reminiscent of Torchlight and a light-hearted sense of humour revolving around all the myriad ways to kill Orcs, OMD is as fun to watch and listen to as it is to play. The game offers a lot of options, and it does a good job of making them all viable. You can be just as effective using traps to decimate Orcs as you can be wading in with Crossbow and Bladestaff. You can use traps to deal direct damage, or take advantage of physics and fling the Orcs around like ragdolls. You can also opt to be a weapon-wielder, lopping heads and shooting faces, or you can load up with spells and lay all kinds of elemental smackdown. Or any combination of the above.   Orcs Must Die is an aesthetically pleasing game that transcends its origins and does not disappoint in living up to its namesake. This game is excellent.
4052	1	a	7/10, would conquer the world as India again.   Fun game, and it's interesting balancing your relations with other countries based upon your government type. Combat can be buggy, though ~ especially around walls. In fact, expect the game to wig out in some way when anything wall-like is involved. It was a good idea to use period paintings (for loading screens) and background music in the game. There are some good mods available for it. The campaign map has changed significantly from M2TW. The cheat menu is no longer present, so you can't use cheats to work around bugs :(. Big graphics improvement over the predecessor, as always. Changing government types is a little counter-intuitive, and it seems strange that you have to do Monarchy -&gt; Republic -&gt; Constitutional Monarchy, rather than going, say, Monarchy -&gt; Constitutional Monarchy, but, ah, well.
3651	1	a	the best
4372	1	a	Nothing else stood the test of time
1534	1	a	Neat.
4484	1	a	SPAZ is a gmae which I can heartily recommend based on a few short facts.  1. The game's graphics are beautiful with a unique and disticive art style and lots of interesting and diverse weather conditions. 2. The ship designs are distinctive with their own mix of strengths and weaknesses and each has fully customisable loadouts to better suit whatever your style of play. 3. The game is long. Very long in fact but still manages to make each system feel unique and mysterious. 4. I controls are natural and destinctive with hotkeys that allow all sorts of game changing things to occur including ejecting cargo, jettisoning spare crew and releasing the ship's armour all of which improve the handling of the ship. 5. It's cheap and worth every last dime you drop on it.  If you like exploration, space combat and custom ships then you can't go wrong with SPAZ.
455	1	a	Picked this up at 75% off for the steam achievement for the holidays, but quickly ended up spending an hour in it. And then another... and another. The game is just really clean and does what it sets out to do really well. This puts a ton of creativity back into the bland 'tower defense' style genre and plays to different strengths. If you're confident with a crossbow or a sword, you can dump money and items into improving that. If your trap strategy is top notch, dump all your money into a maze of tricks and traps designed to do only one thing; Kill. All. The Orcs.  Would have paid full price if I knew what I was getting into. It's got great gameplay, a smooth engine, just the right dash of humor and a lot of things to kill in a bunch of different ways. And if you ever find yourself with nothing to do, scratch your chin at the leaderboards and fine tune your strategy to not only survive the orcs - but kill them efficiently and brutally.
2849	1	a	So I've always been a Total War junkie. I started playing way back in the days of the first Medieval Total War, and have been playin since. Empire is starting to get a little old, but its replay value still has me coming back for me. Out of all of their series, this one is my favorite. The AI is a little predictable, but this game just offers so much.
550	1	a	A very fun game. It's kind of like Sanctum but with a fantasy setting instead of a science fiction setting. Build traps, unleash the horde and kill waves of orcs with your crossbow/sword and the traps you've build. At first I thought it was a little easy, but obviously the further you progress teh harder the levels become. I recommend this game to everyone that likes towerdefense-shooter hybrids. The only downside is the lack of multiplayer, but that's what Dungeon Defenders is for I guess.
4053	1	a	I play as Prussia and no matter how much of europe i annex i still have a lower score than the maratha confederacy. So i invade India where I outnumber them 5 to 1 since i didnt have much time i had the ai fight it. I lost. Then the Marathas invade Spain. 10 turns later Berlin is a smoldering ruin. 12/10 would get invaded again
4335	1	a	Empire Total War is one of the best strategy games in my opinion, the battles are intense and it requires a lot of strategy and is a challenge that includes is a lot of detail included throughout, like most games in the Total War series. 9/10   Amazing!
439	1	a	It's an enjoyable tower defense game with a good amount of humor. Gameplay is intuitive and fun with unique abilities allowing for creative 'deaths.'
2842	1	a	AI Logic - send 3 brigs and a sloop against a 3 heavy first rates...
4958	1	a	After I understood the game (controls/menu/what am I doing?) I've got to say: One of the best indie games I've played so far. The soundeffects are a bit lowfi, but it has modding ablities, so maybe theres a way to replace them. Doesn't really affect the overall manifique experience
676	1	a	10+ hours.. Awsome TD/HD game.. Lots of jokes.. No multiplayer.. 9 of 10..
3426	1	a	One of the best installments for THE best turn based strategy franchise ever. Expansive and immersive, it's easy to sink over 200 hours into this game. The exceptional modding community too makes this game a must buy. The vanilla version is great, but with add ons like Darthmod, you are missing out if you don't buy this
3375	1	a	Awesome game! Would recommend it.
4639	1	a	A wondeful game in the Star Control genre, has some nice twists, a self managed difficulty, cool 2d graphics, some soundbites to chuckle over and ZOMBIES.. how could you resist..  Highly recommended
3994	1	a	Got into multiplayer for the first time Went into a server People were friendly at the beginning Something happened War Raged among them Fight began I quited to avoid trouble 10/10 Would play multiplayer again (if there were servers available) 
5202	1	a	Super fun, really enjoyed this on the Free weekend
4908	1	a	Space battles.. realtime mostly. And truly I have no idea why I enjoy this game so much. That and it's dirt cheap for another, oh, 20 minutes :-)
3062	1	a	10/10 Excellent game. Great features with city development and naval battles, even if not always perfect
1460	1	a	So very buggy but if you want a great game set in the classical era, you'll find none better than Empire: Total War
2640	1	a	The simplified interface elements, great campaign, and much-improved map and information screens make this the most accessible Total War yet, and a great place for those unfamiliar with the series to get started.
5003	1	a	A excellent space exploration game with some awesome space battles. Extremely addictive and fun, the battles just get bigger and better not to mention creating your own fleet as you progress.  Well spent $15. This game could be worth double and I'd gladly buy it.
584	1	a	Awesome...a proper blaster with some turret style tactics and humour thats reminiscent of Evil dead' Ash...recommend it 100%
4373	1	a	 Amateur Total War Fan's review
4131	0	a	worst Total War
871	1	a	really good action based tower defense games with dark humor and many dead orcs
4047	1	a	Most incredible game I've ever played. Bought it years ago and still play it to this day.
5124	1	a	An updated Star Control for today's gamer. Well worth the money!
4071	0	a	Got Black screen on startup. I dont know how to fix it and CA ignoring this problem
4275	1	a	This game is freaking bae. Biggest all round map, all those trade ports means naval superiority is amazing. (Spanish OP early game) prefer british personally. Played and won the game on the highest difficulty. My favourite Total War game.   Obviously many bugs but hey you have mods and just awesome community for that ððð
4142	1	a	This game is great for 1700s-1800s fans and stratagists but also for other total war fans
755	1	a	Amusing, mindless fun. Slaughtering orcs makes for good gameplay and a great way to unwind after work. The third-person perspective offers a different approach to tower defense games.
2251	0	a	okay for i begin i want to say this first when i bought empire it was really fun to play but after a few weeks it started to get boring.  in 1 battle you have seen all the kill animations and al the battles are pretty much the same you line up your troops and the anemy runs towards you after a couple of battles you have seen everything. if you want to buy a totat war game i recommend shogun 2 or shogun 2 fall of the samurai but if you are looking for a cheaper total war i prefere napoleon
804	1	a	This game is quite unique perhaps on the PC because whilst it is a tower defence game, this is a tower defence game built on pure action. It is a fast, fluid third person game with a high frame rate and a frenetic pace that never lets up. The controls are responsive and easy to get used to, and the gameplay is as tactically deep as it is fast and furious. Add to that just a lot of great humour that is expressed in the hero's opening lines to each level and this is definitely one of the best indie action games of recent years.
441	1	a	Pros: +music +dialoge +so much orcs to kill +lot of traps, multiple ways to beat same levels +3 build paths in lategame +storyline &amp; main character Cons: -short (took 7 hours to complete and I think it's not the fastest time out there) -some levels were too easy to complete when other were somewhat challenging (last 3 maybe)
3460	1	a	This is one of the greatest games ever! 
4312	0	a	play it only a little, but I have a problem with blurry text and I'm not the only one - true, min resolution is 1280x1024 but it's silly for many widescreen monitors (1440x900) - no fix ever released, no possible solution ---&gt; game is practicly unplayable if i can't ever properly read the text
1195	1	a	THIS HAD ALWAYS BEEN MY FAVOURITE TBS. I WOULD SAY TO THE DEVELOPERS (WHOEVER THEY ARE OR WILL BE SINCE THIS GAME WONT BE DEVELOPED ANYMORE OF WHAT I HEARD AND READ ON THE FORUMS), PLEASE, PEASE FOR SO MANY PLAYERS SAKE @LEAST FINISH THE GAME BY ADDING THE MOUNTAIN CLANS !!!!!
708	1	a	This game is a great tower defence game, really cool design and nice graphics... absolute steal on the humble bundle I got it from.
4263	1	a	With many many many mods its playable
2806	1	a	Empire Total War is an excellent addition to the Total War series. It has the right balance of turn-based strategic gameplay with macro level diplomatic, and resource management to make the game well suited for a variety of strategy game-play enthusiasts.   If you enjoyed Rome Total War, they definitely raised the bar in Empire Total War, its a must have!
400	1	a	No orcs were hurt in the making of this game - oh, wait...
1052	1	a	FANTASTIC, simple, tower defense game. Upgrading your tools/traps leads you to replay levels and dominate the levels more efficiently to get better ratings for more upgrades. It's an addicting formula with a great sense of humor mixed with gratuitous violence. If only there were more levels out there..
4026	1	a	This game is amazing! I got this game during the free weekend and it was super fun. I didnt get to see the naval combat but the land battles where epic
3455	1	a	Built with Polish and Beauty, to near perfection, this monstrous game will keep you sweating deep into the night for many years. Until the next version that is! Empire adds a new era to the list for historic battle gamers, and this one will be sure to please. From the smoky reports of bayonet laden muskets, to cannon fire and many multitudes of factions at your disposal, you really can't go wrong with this game. Add the many DLC, and you have more historic toys in your arsenal.
5068	1	a	I really enjoy this game.
2192	1	a	This is an amazing game I highly recommend this game to everyone especialy to the fans of the total war seriers, graphics are beautiful on high settings and gameplay is perfect.
4182	1	a	.
159	1	a	Great looks, performance, humor, MUSIC and action!! Do not miss this game!
3325	1	a	love everything about this game. a must have for war buffs
617	1	a	Great Game! Fun to play and easy to learn!
4907	1	a	Awesome fun for the price. Looks simple but is has a ton of depth, research trees, custom ship outfitting and upgrading, mining, space pirating. Soon you'll have a small fleet of ships under your command and a huge galaxy to explore, do what you like or follow the story. Loving it!
267	0	a	Fun idea for a game but i'm finding it to be very glitchy. The opening cinematic freezes after about the fourth word the old man says and the third level refuses to load.
1280	1	a	Inside a Star-Filled Sky is by far one of the most curious games I have played in a long time. Featuring a recursive level diving type system that allows you to go into your enemies, power ups and even yourself and change aspects of the respective object to change the game around. The gameplay itself is much like many other twin stick shooter type deals but a lot more tactical. I myself am not entirely sure who I'd recommend this to but it certainly is an interesting concept.
335	1	a	With Orcs Must Die!, the game starts off slow and seems to get quicker and more faster paced as you gain experience and get access to more abilities. Graphics are nice in this game as well. It Does seem to get a bit tedious after a long while and the pace at which the orcs spawn and rush in increases.   If you do not have a lot of time to be able to play because of work, schooling or family schedules but would like to spend 15 min, 30 min or an hour just relaxing, I would recommend this game.   So overall this game is enjoyable, especially if you dont always have tons of time on your hands.
72	1	a	Do yourself a favour and get the frickin game!!!!!
5152	1	a	Best 10 bucks I ever spent, highly reccomend trying the demo. You'll be hooked.
2827	1	a	good games for ships to expload
386	1	a	A simple action game about fighting hordes and lasting in a contention zone (a la Delta 8 Nova Prospekt in Half Life 2), with the twist of putting a lot of crazy defenses. A game for only fun and laughs, but that usually enough for a great time.
3195	1	a	great game if your intrested in industrial revolution combat and in depth history of the time and oh, hah! love the patriot movie this is the game for you
4140	1	a	A very fun and addictive game
2037	1	a	No better tactical series unlike Total War, especially for world domination.
5134	1	a	Hours of fun! Legit i love this game!!!!!!!!!!! =^w^=
3365	1	a	in order to enjoy this game you must buy it. its quite interesting you control tax, research, trade, funds, religon, troops, battles, buildings, technology, government, and diplomacy. it is a really good game. ive been playing religously for the past 3 weeks. i really sugest that you get it. its worth every cibernetic penny.
3393	1	a	The game is well made with very few glitches. The historical content is captivating and th campaigns are very immersive. However, some of he mechanics in region development and building devlopment lack in variety, but the game makes up for this with its vast and large campaign map.
1676	1	a	Probably one of the best RTS games i've ever played (along with just about any other total war title). There are also plenty of mods available if you should get bored of the vanilla game but lets face it, that is'nt gonna â¥â¥â¥â¥ing happen. 100% recommend this game to anyone who enjoys strategy games. gr8 m8 i r8 8/8.
3676	1	a	should have been studying for my finals instead 10/10
2109	0	a	Graphical issues render game unplayable.. Campaign map lag:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?edit=vd&amp;v=_U92W-yzo2c   there are also broken shadows in battle map as well as the campaign map.... only solution really - is to turn off shadows -_- So, for ONCE AGAIN, getting my hopes up, taking my money and letting me down: -5/10 Don't buy.
2470	1	a	yes completely the best total war 
1771	1	a	Epic game! One of my favorites of all time.
4799	1	a	This is a really low-strategy 2d space action game. It's less strategic and more action-y than, for instance, AI War. I very much enjoyed the first few chapters of this game, but then a story event happens that causes you to lose all the territory you took, and at that point it wasn't worth it anymore. I don't know how it ends, and it's really not worth finding out.
2191	1	a	Very good game, would be epic if it had multiplayer campaighn but the quick battles are sick.
4847	1	a	I collected this game.
5029	1	a	Before I knew it, I had played over 93 hours of this game. I'm almost afraid to try playing it again! So obviously I recommend it.
4408	1	a	Great game with strong historical background that is well integrated to the action. The wide variety of strategy that you can use makes this game interesting to play and replay. The battles keep a dynamic part in this game to make a good balance between pure strategy and action.
3827	1	a	Nice fine polished gameplay and great graphics.  Gameplay: 9/10  Graphics 8/10  Audio 8/10  Value For Money: 8/10   All up, this game is worth getting if you love the Total War series. 9/10
3947	1	a	9/10 Could have more to it, but really good for the price. I have over 200 hrs offline just for reference. Plus it's moddable.
5045	1	a	This game is incredibly addictive, don't let its semi-lame name confuse you!
263	0	a	I'm not a huge fan of tower defense games to begin with, so meh. In this style, Dungeon Defenders was far more enjoyable.
1918	1	a	if you love Civ 5 you will love this
3140	1	a	Dear Reader of this Review:   Empire: Total War is the most emotional, connective, personal, grudging, and eventually, important Total war game, to date. You may play as a european nation, however, this is not where your war takes place. Instead of fighting in europe, your forces fight for the new world. America, and in some cases, India.  You need trade for money. The trade is here. Therefore, everyone fights over it. And all the money you earn goes right back into your military to KEEP fighting for it. This is Total War at it's peak. HUZZAH!!!
2890	1	a	will the the game able to grow in now and in to the fucher as u move thorw the the ages it cound have alot of opion where to you could get use and mybe the hem have famil and frinds so i hope the game widen there oipitueaty
1374	1	a	In 1706, I, leader of Russia, conquered Crimea with General Ivan Mazepa leading my troops into battle.  In 1707, the Crimean people rose up and overthrew the garrison I placed in their lands.  In 1708, with Prince Anikita Repnin leading a second army while General Mazepa was tied up in Dagestan, I marched against them and besieged their holdings in Bakchisaray. Rather than give up without a fight, their forces left the city and attacked my army. I placed my troops on a sloping hill nearby, entrenching my infantry and cannons while my cavalry lay in wait at the crest, ready to charge. I had over 1900 battle-hardened troops at my disposal, veterans, all. They had over 2000, but were mostly comprised of peasant militia, with only a single troop of cavalry with their leader. With the elevated and fortified position at my disposal, I waited for their army to cross the valley below. Their leader rode out ahead of their infantry to scope out the battlefield. As soon as he saw what was waiting for him and his men, he turned and ran all the way back to the city, without so much as a word to his infantry, who kept marching up the hill in the face of artillery barrage from my cannons. By the time the Crimean army reached the top of the hill, two of their regiments were already routed, peppered by my infantry's guns after they were too close for effective bombardment. After 5 regiments of my cavalry charged along their flank, their forces were shattered completely and routed.  By the end, over 75% of their forces were dead on the field, with less than 25% of my own joining them, most of whom were merely injured and would live to fight another day.  Empire: Total War called this a 'Heroic Victory'. It did not feel heroic. Perhaps granting them a period of tax exemption will take the edge offâ¦
863	1	a	OMD plays a little like Sanctum, but with a greater focus on personal power and less on mazing. The engine also has several physics based traps enabling you to reposition the creeps, enabling fun things like flinging orcs back to the beginning of your kill corridor or tossing them up to the top of a wall covered in instruments death to tumble back down it in bloody chunks. The only bad thing I can really say about this game is that there's no co-op.  Highly reccommended if you even have only a passing interest in TD games.
4880	1	a	The hull has been breached and the science is leaking out!
4228	1	a	its good, best total war i've ever played, but idk after i won the first grand campaign i dont feel like playing it again but still, it was an awesome grand campaign
587	1	a	I used to like orcs...
359	1	a	This game is really fun! You start of with a funny intro comic thing giving you the story, and from then on it's orc slaying action! You unlock more traps with every level you beat resulting in more fun ways to kill the orcs! This game is a must have! 10/10
350	1	a	Surprisingly fun cross between Tower Defense style gameplay, Dungeon Keeper, and a first person shooter like Serious Sam.
3703	1	a	Empire Total War is a really fun game and for the price, absolutely worth it. There is tons of replay value and multiplayer matches are still going on. If you're familiar with the Total War franchise I think you'll definitely like it. If you are someone who enjoys strategy games especially ones with a 3D RTS aspect, you'll fall in love with this game.
4478	1	a	Beautiful graphic and great game system.  I really love AoE franchises.
1855	1	a	I put way too many hours into this game before I discovered Napoleon Total War and I haven't played it since. 
2592	1	a	With 564 hours played on record, it's my second most favourite game. It's just so much fun to conquer the old european, america and middle-east territories while lining up the infantry, horses and artillery.   In short, why is this game so good? - Nice graphics - Easy to learn the mechanics, and yet challeging enough to keep playing - Send a million men to their grave, and get an achievement for it
349	1	a	Strangely addictive - and it's funny!
2380	1	a	I can't say i've played this game for very long. ;P But all jokes aside i've been in love with all the total wars games since there start. This is a great game and will get you lost in a new world. Good luck taking over the world! :)
1217	1	a	Really hard tower defense game.  Has two main campaigns, the first is of which is easy enough but the second gets a bit harder. Also 'Quickplay' levels which are the same as in the campaign but with more limits on what turrets and upgrades are available.  It's very easy to pick up and learn, and smashing through the campaigns even on hardest difficulty is not terribly hard if you've played any tower defense games before, but the Quickplay missions for the second camapaign get diabolical, so good luck getting the associated achievements! Nice simple visuals, sound can get a bit annoying because certain things (explosions) are repeated a lot.  Overall it's good for a playthrough, and if you're into TD at all then make sure to play this.
2407	1	a	A good alternative to newer titles if you don't want to spend 60 $. Installing darthmod makes the game far better than napoleon and gives plenty new playing oportunities.  Recomended.  7/10 no darthmod.  9/10 with darthmod.
3177	1	a	Great Game the best in the series so far. well worth the money. plus im starting to like the whole steam thing.
4114	1	a	This game is a gem, 10/10 from me. It was challenging as well as revolutionary for the Total War series. Nothing better than watching a ship explode during a naval battle or the occasional bayonet charge.
4994	1	a	WoW! Just simply wow! One of the best games i ever played! Pros -Alot of ships -Alot of equipment(Armor,specialists,weapons etc.) -Customizate you ships and fleets -Hours and Hours(even years) of enjoyable FUN -Never gets boring Cons -There are no
2930	1	a	Don't â¥â¥â¥â¥ with Russia in the campaign
4469	1	a	If you like shoving 50 cavalrymen into a space the size of a fridge then firebombing an entire colony to surrender in a matter of seconds, this game is for you.
4620	1	a	Solid 40 hours of gameplay for an indie space opera style game; fun to play and build up a fleet, worth getting as a 'pick up and play' game for an hour or two at a time.
4871	1	a	Really fun game, although it does not look appealing at first, it is a really good game, if you are into these kind of games that is.
1745	1	a	One of my all time favorite games, this got me into the total war series and i havent looked back since and now own all of them, Brilliant RTS with line infantry, cannons and so much more to keep you occupied for hours. 9/10
310	1	a	Great fun and a nice combination of strategicly planing your defense and bashing away orcs in direct combat.
1378	1	a	A strategy game is a game played without uz time squeezing masterpiece. If you like a very reasonable price to bulunabilir.Ä±f a strategy for a bundle that came earlier and strategies do not say you love yourself playing this game.There are kind of a war like sea wars and soil wars.There are lots of kind of soldier and there is something i don't like.this is when i was england,i was â¥â¥â¥â¥ing all countries but when i was ottomans,all countries was â¥â¥â¥â¥ing me....   Un jeu de stratÃ©gie est un jeu jouÃ© sans uz temps serrant chef-d'Åuvre. Si vous aimez un prix trÃ¨s raisonnable de trouvable.Ä±f une stratÃ©gie pour un paquet qui sont arrivÃ©s plus tÃ´t et les stratÃ©gies ne disent pas que vous aimez vous jouer ce game.There sont une sorte de guerre comme les guerres de la mer et le sol wars.There ya beaucoup de type de soldat et il ya quelque chose que je ne fais pas like.this est quand je Ã©tais en Angleterre, je baisais tous les pays, mais quand je Ã©tais poufs, tous les pays fus me baise ....  baÅyapÄ±t bir strateji oyunu .Uzun sÃ¼re sÄ±kmadan oynanabilir bir oyun . Daha evvel bundle a geldiÄi iÃ§in Ã§ok makul bir fiyata bulunabilir.If bir strateji severseniz ve bu oyunu oynamadÄ±ysanÄ±z kendinize strateji sever demeyin .Bayagi asker cesiti var ama iste ingiltere oluyorsunuz,dunyanin amina koyuyorsunuz.Osmanli oluyorsunuz,dunya aminiza koyuyor...
938	1	a	This is a brutal TD, Hack n Slash game that blew my mind. Its so damn badass that you cant even imagine it! I bought it for 5 Euros (MediaMarket) plus all dlcs. It runs well and fast on my kind of old computer and its MUST BUY FOR ALL OF YOU TD, STRADEGY AND Hack n slash FANS  9.5/10
2293	0	a	 A poor mans Age of Empire's.  F*ck this sh*tty game.  0/10
2645	1	a	This game was stunning thanks Creative Assembly !!!!!
3619	1	a	I keep on coming back to this game! Must be for a reason. Also Empire Darthmod is the way to go.
4797	1	a	TOO MUCH ADDICTION! DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME! It's like playing Civ.5 and wondering where 6 hours went.  So good, in the worst, time sucking, way.
2821	1	a	Tactics nah i prefer brute force!  Slaughter everyone that gets in your way. But be careful before u know your capital has been conquered behind your back!  This game kept me busy for quite a while it is a bit repetitive but the feeling when you win a almost impossible battle is amazing! And that moment when u rule the world is just MUHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. 
28	1	a	This is an awesome game, lots of action, and humor. The best part is you can play this on the crappiest laptops/computers!
4508	1	a	Great game  Worth every hour of playing. If you are into simple not complicated 2D space shooters it's game for you. There's a lot of humor mainly in text (unfortunately) but it won't make this game worse.   fully customizable ships. You can equip your ship as you like it: (engines, armor, energy shield, any weapon slot, add-ons, crew)   every ship in this game is different and almost all obtainable so you won't fly with the same thing until you find the best one   easy controls, use WSAD and mouse (Yes you control ship by yourself) ;]   not enough resources, or crew? No problem destroy UTA, Civilian station. You also don't have to buy technology from any station, you are the pirate ARRRRRRR :D   fight like gladiator with your ship in Bounty Hunters arena  I like the zombie infection idea it reminds me Beast from Homeworld: Cataclysm.  Overall 9/10 
23	1	a	Exellent twist on the tower defence games, allowing you to control a hero as the waves decend.  funny story easy to control (works with controller) cool puzzels (great challange, not sure if you reference this as a puzzel game) this one is single player, but adds a competitive edge with leader boards, beat your friends.  lots ot fun, would recommend it.
3275	1	a	Empire total war is highly confusing to a player of old tw games, but after you've mastered it, it is extremely fun. I'd definitely recommend it.
205	1	a	A little rough around the edges but a fun little td type action game.
1153	1	a	They took everything what's good in disciples 3 and entirely rebalanced it to make good disciples chapter and good game in general, they significantly improved writing and level design and they gave it for free for owners of both previous disciples 3 games.  Global strategy aspect is still lost, but now each individual battle is better than in disciples 2, so in the end it's on par with disciples 2.   There are still couple of weird scripts and bugs here, but in general game runs totally fine and smooth, also works with nvidia surround. The most notable bug is what they changed in undead campaign final boss, check guides to possible workaround for that.   http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=574495826   It's a pity that dwarves, orks and merfolk expansions to the third game would never be made, there was also possibility for barbarians and bandits expansions.
25	1	a	Orcs Must Die! is an outstanding, well done Indie game with excellent, quick and ongoing support in the Steam forums by Robot Entertainment. This game can be played several different ways, so there is great replayability. Examples: 1) you can play just to complete the 24 War Mage mode levels followed by the 24 Nightmare mode levels, followed by 5 levels more for each if you own the DLC, 2) you can playthrough to '5 skull' all the levels, and 3) you can playthrough trying to achieve higher or top scores by using different combinations of traps. You MUST, however, make sure you have at least a dual core processor as this game heavily uses the second core for its animations. I highly recommend this game!
1233	1	a	if you are a tower defense buff then this is a great game to add to the collection requires patience like any tower defense but still an overall joyous experience
1437	1	a	A very fun game on the revolution the only Total War with the USA.
2048	1	a	This is one of the best games ever. Every RTS fan SHOULD have this game. I don't know from what to start from, Wide variety of countries, from native americans (Warpath Expansion) to Poland and even Russia and... even India. The battle mechanics are easy and intuitave, every battle is unique. The graphic is perfect even as a game from 2009. And I could go for ages. Just Buy It.
1976	0	a	Thoroughly unimpressive. To be honest, I wanted to like this game. It looks like a Total War game but alas, it does not feel or play like one. I guess I was just looking for something more... entertaining?  First off, I'm a fan of the time period. That was one of the biggest draws for me. But for every step forward, I feel like Empire Total War takes two steps back. The first sign of disappointment came after two and a half hours of game play. Up until that point, I was still getting acclimated to the controls, visuals, etc etc. The time came for me to boldly ride forth and vanquish my foes in an enemy fort. What transpired could only be described as a giant boring mosh pit. Clones in different color clothing flailed at each other for a while; desperate to get those kill moves in before they all die of old age. On the fastest speed, it probably took five minutes of real time to clear up the traffic jam at hole in my enemies wall. Still, I was optimistic.  A few hours of gameplay later, and another incident occurred. This time I was defending my fort against my enemies. I was clearly unprepared and had a disadvantage in both troop number and troop quality. At all other points of the game, I was playing to the numbers and crushing every battle; so obviously my expectation was that I was on the receiving end of the beating this time. Yet the AI curiously decided to section its assaulting force into bits and parade around my fort; instead of assaulting it head on, like someone trying to win would. Needless to say, that didn't end well for them. After that, I couldn't pretend that I liked this game anymore.  But at the end of the day, I can't say I hate this game. Sure, my list of complaints are many; but it all boils down to what I had feared... This game isn't a total war game. It's someones crude imitation of what a total war game set in this period would look like. That's not to say it isn't terrible. It's just dull. For my money, the original rome total war, or shogun 2 are superior in both spirit and gameplay.  
4778	1	a	I love the game its just i wish i had a copy to play wtih.
1703	1	a	THIS IS AWESOME!!! 
1897	1	a	I dont see any problems with this game i think its better then Napoleon total war 10/10
4471	1	a	one of the best strategy games of all time.
5195	1	a	Great game, loads of fun :)
2180	1	a	Awesome game just get darthmod it makes it even more awesome
965	1	a	This game is epic! It's so much fun! :) Totally recommended!
4773	1	a	It has pirates. It has zombies. It's in space. 10/10
3740	1	a	Nice game.
1347	1	a	Empire Total War is by far the best in the Total war series. The change in gameplay with the addition of rifles and cannon is refreshing and the maps of america and india are a nice change from the stale map of europe that is the standard of most games of this type. Also the ship battles are a big step forward from the previous games. A must buy!
2385	1	a	How do you play the expantion packs?....Need help please
2905	1	a	This was one of the best games in the series, set in one of the most interesting eras of history. It also allows me to rewrite the depressing outcome of the great northern war and make my glorious monarch the undisputed, much deserving, king of the Baltic!   Dealing with the treaty-breaking, backstabbing (as always) Danes and gain access to the bounties of Norway in the process? Check.  Stomping the small nuisance that is Poland and heeling August the Not-So-Strong? Yawn. Check.  Chasing the tsar and his large army in a hazardous drive to Moscow, culminating in a pitched battle where a pyrrhic (but strategic) victory is hard-won through sheer willpower and divine providence, thus securing the legacy of Gustavus, Torstenson, Oxenstierna and others? Check.  Oh, and there went the rest of Europe. Except the United Provinces. I like them. 
1615	1	a	Empire Total War is one of the best games I have ever played. You can play this game in many ways like a Civization game with the campagin map but. It was A LOT of replay value since if you choose to play as a different nation they have comepletley different play styles, units, and diplomecy which makes two play throughs of Grand Campagin completley different. In combat however is where it really shines. The strategy is SO in depth about how to deploy your units, when to deploy your units, and what formation is extremly fun. It is also EXTREMLY detailed as you can zoom in and clearly see your units individually and watch them fight. My favorite part is to look after a big battle at the battlefield where you can look at all of the bodies bc they dont despawn and you can see where they were deployed and how bloody was the combat it is amazing, However the diplomecy can be annoying with the AI and they are kinda dumb but all is forgiven if you choose to go on hard and play the battles yourseld because that is where the focus is.   If you are new to the series this is one of the most realistic RTS games out there. I have seen on the Military History Channel a show called Deceisive Battles I believe it was called and they used Rome: Total War to simulate the battles with amazing accuracy. This game came out later than it 
1530	1	a	This game is between Medieval 2 and Shogun 2, it has some similarities between bot of them.so ill mention the good and the bad.I like to mention the key difference between the TW games whit this one and that is gunpowder, almost all units are ranged, that means that melee combat takes a backseat, and you need to properly position your troops in shooting lines in order to achieve victory and not let your flanks fail, also artillery is very important now.   THE GOOD 1-Three theater to play in, Europe,America and India and 4 trading regions. 2-The ability to expand on another theaters whit factions that never established overseas empires(Sweden Poland) 3-Very different way to battle than the rest of total war games. if you play whit a melee mind you will fail here. 4-Factions attitude towards you and knowing why some factions doesnt like you is my favorite part of the game.(before i used to go crazy not knowing why some factions hated me etc etc) 5-Different goverment system Republic, Contitutional Monarchy and Absolute Monarchy.(some factions may like your or hate you if they are of the same or opposed goverment type) 6-Different types of religion.Hinduism,Islam,Catholic,Protestan,Animisn and Sikhism(although i dont know why there Sikh there no main factions that has the religion,only a minor one and it appears if it rebels in punjabi region) 7-Emergent factions, this factions appear in certain regions if they rebel in their cities(example or if you eliminate the mayor faction in their main theather for example Spain. if you eliminate Spain on Europe their territories in the americas will divide into 3 factions Mexico,Gran Colombia,Pirates, or if said destroyed factions conquered some territory they will revert back to their original owners. 8-Minor factions add a whole new level of diplomacy and there are quite a few of them.Although they rarely expand. 9-The researh tree.  THE BAD 0-few factions to choose from, and they feel and have the almost the same units, except Ottoman and Maratha.They should have been more Non-european factions. 1-Game frezzes when you press ESC ALT. 2-I finished the american campiagn and havent got the American faction yet. 3-When a town is being sieged, you cant position well your troops,when they are manning the cannons,also the units tend not to shoot their enemies when below them. 4-Game crashes from time to time. 5-Diplomacy removed the following option, Attack this faction,Break alliance whit faction. 6-Agents spawn randomly not when one needs them.(in one case i had about 10 missionarys and i dint even knew where they were) 7-some regions have individual towns where they grow, intead of being regions themselfs.(example france is just one region it should have been divided up at least into 3 or 4 regions,so if you lose that region you lose a huge deal of land . 8-Campaign winning conditions should be more free. for example playing as Sweden you need some regions in russia in order to win, that means that engaging in a alliance whit said faction impossible.there whould be a FREE MODE where the winning condition is just to capture territory not from some factions. 9-Naval battles are not enjoyable. 10-Africa theather not present,Africa would have been a very fun and nice theater to play in would have some unique factions. 11-India Theather should have had more factions on it 1 or 2 more.   I have to say that this game is good, but it feels like they had more ideas but they dint implement them i blame SEGA i think they pushed them into finishing quickly (you know production) the main reason i say this is beacuse of the Mughal Empire they are cited in the major factions window(all mayor factions are playable) but this one isnt playable.. but the weird thing if they have their own unique units. Also some factions have unique units for example Scotland(emergent faction).
4393	1	a	This game it's a nuke by that I mean it is so epic that whenever you want to play it,you just want to do it from start to the end .
4350	1	a	very good game, would recmond to any one
4039	1	a	Played as Austria. Get f***ed by venice that has a single region. Played as Prussia, conquered Poland, Austria and Bavaria. Good to be Prussian. Get f***ed by the British. Played as British, f***ed everyone else. Good to be tea drinking gentlemen.
2019	0	a	The game just keeps crashing and if you read the forums im not alone with this issue. Worst programing Ive ever come across.
1121	1	a	Best tower defense-style game ever. Still holds true to this day.

3056	1	a	Best yet RTS game ever. Well played for the creators. First time played when I was 12yrs. That time I played in cyber cafe lol.   Highly recommended this game if you're into strategic domination game with empire management (trades, technologies, armies and much more) and battle against enemies with thousands of your armies. Damn nice.   For me, Empire: Total War is much better than any other Total War games. The reason why I picked this as the top of Total War is because the management is much easier to understand, the map is huge as shown from America to India. Then, fleet battle is damn cool and the siege too. Also, balanced the diplomatic of agreement. So yea.   I prefer this game than any other Total War games evendoe I do played Medieval II, Rome II and Shogun II last time.
4108	0	a	This Game is Suck! super lagging!! i love total war but i hate empire cos this is stubid super bugs lagging.
4892	1	a	Grate game remiding good old times when GTA was something totaly different than it is now and gameplay was about dynamics and plan. The official goal of the game is to reach the center of the glaxy ( dont belive the HYPE !) its all about UPGRADES . Game give's you oportunity to mix with different schematics but after all its DPS that define winner. IF YOU LIKE some oldsQl yet interplanetary gameplay its JUST MENT 2 Have it . Try to think about it as kid of GTA 1 and STARMAGEDDON what can be bad about that ?... 'AND REMEBER UPGRADES ARE EVERYTHING'.
2616	1	a	alot of fun if you are a history buff or enjoy fun stergety games this is a game for you 10/10
2449	1	a	This game is fun and brilliantly made! When you think only minutes passed it has been really a couple hours! Those types of games is what makes gaming actually nice and exciting.
1764	1	a	I love the campaign map its the best in the Total war series in my opinion.
1109	1	a	My all time favorite tower defense type game. The price is too cheap for it's worth. Love the style and the humor in the game. The only flaw that I can find on this game, there's no Co-Op.
2857	1	a	awsome game
2230	1	a	Great game, especially with Darthmod, recomended if you like Total war games. If not familiar to how the old total war games work, it wouldn't take you long tob get used to it. I really want an Total War: Empire II please CA, because the era, theaters, and main consept would be amazing to see again with a new engine.
16	1	a	Definitely rare, when the entire objective of a game can be put into its title. Very easy to learn, nice build-up 'tutorial' (one thing every round), and funny characters with awesome lines.
272	0	a	This game is all about killing orcs with traps, no big deal.
4230	1	a	1000000/10 One of my faviorite games of all time. Huge battles. Huge fun. GO PRUSSIA!
2060	1	a	11/9 would be bugged for land every turn by Russia again
4162	1	a	For me still one of the best TW games ... after the 'desease' at release with a bunch of patches solved most problems of the game during the following months. This was a hard time for many hardcore TW fans and many were really annoyed with it or still are. This is understand able, because many of the bugs were silly at least, as well some of the patches made things worse but did not improve problems. So players become feeling to be the beta testing object for CA for a still bought, but very bugged game and this is not acceptable. Empire is now running very good, but in combination with Darth Mod which improves the game to a status, which normally should be delivered by Creative Assembly itself in my opinion. I don't know in detail how Darth and his modding team did improve, but the result is only great. For example, the AI was really improved - not that AI becomes a smart enemy in campaign, but the acting was put by Darth into good rails of logical issue. Some things were improved by simple overwriting, for example the masses of merchant ships build by AI insteed war ships with the simple solution to let recruit smaller war ships (up to 4th class) in merchant ports too. I played Napoleon very often too and some of the the improvements here are missing in Empire. Napoleon itself is very interesting too, but for me too local and too small as campaign map.  To be honest, the following Shogun TW and RTW-2 brought further, very good improvements in game, but these games did not convince me to play further. RTW-2 has for me a very bad graphic and game hub design which did me more annoy as giving fun.  In conclusion, Empire is still my favorite TW game and still makes fun after nearly 3,500 hours game time!
5231	1	a	Great story and a lot of fun to just try and kill everyone. Neither is too easy.
2011	1	a	If you ever feel a deep emotional loss in your heart from not being able to massacre the Indians cerca 1700-1800 this game is your ticket
1103	1	a	It\'s hard but fun.
3437	1	a	I have been an avid fan of the Total War franchise since Shogun: Total War way back in the day. Between the Total War franchise and Civilization, I honestly do not know whcih is better. Then Empire Total War came around and alot of people were dissapointed. However, it would seem I am one of the few who doesn't hate on Empire as much as others. The problem I have with Empire is that it gets boring to me real quick. Nothing about this game compells me to play for than an a couple of hours. That isn't to say the game sucks or anyhting, it is just that's appeal isn't as interesting as Rome or even my favorite Total War game, Medieval 2. However, the battles in this game are amazing and can be very intense. I like the musket and cannon combat, but the melee in the game is useless to me. Bottom line, Empire is average at best. I recommend you eithier get Napoleon: Total War for the complete experience or play one of the other Total War games. If you want this game, get it for cheap.
595	1	a	An excellent game for a reasonnabnle price ! Jump into this action tower defense with loads of fun !
306	1	a	The orcs must die, painfuly and at my pleasure.
4944	1	a	Scratch the surface and it soon becomes deeper than a rather deep hole.  Much pleasure to be had shooting escape pods and watching the lil sods writhe in agony as their atmosphere vents exposing them to the vacuum. Or forcing them aboard only to vent them from the airlock anyway-!  That'll teach you for shooting at me with yer frikkin lasers.   Shoot &gt; Research &gt; Resource &gt; Equip &gt; Shoot like a badass &gt; Research Badass Gear &gt; You see where this is going.  Simple yet satisfying.  9.2 / 10
3728	1	a	Not a game for the soft headed but definitly a master piece in the Genre of RTS games
2872	1	a	In regards to general gameplay this game quite a shift in a series that tends to focus more on the melee combat of the European and Japanese middle ages. Takes a little getting used to as battles are fought rather differently on land and actual naval battles being introduced into the series for the first time. But once you get used to the changes this game is a blast to play. Watching battles unfold in this game is rather enjoy able, as you see your battle lines form up, open fire, and march through volley after volley of cannon and musket fire over piles of dead soldiers. It's also very amusing how you can get so engrossed in watching your infantry that you forget that there is still calvalry in the game until they come crashing into your flank and endanger your entire battle plan. In terms of looks and playbility I can go on all day about why this game is bloody awesome.  That said it does have some downsides. Occasionally the enemy generals will suicide charge at the start of the battle resulting in an easy win as their army's moral plummets in response. Then the enemy units will sometimes start moving non-stop randomly, running back and forth until the entire army is exhausted and has been demolished by cannon fire.(An everlasting bug in all Total War games sadly) Unlike other games of the series your generals are no longer unique. You can create them at will from another unit, and keep both, making them just another unit instead of something you worked to earn, develop and preserve; losing one of them doesn't threaten to unhinge your plans in the slightest outside of the battle they die in. You also have no real control over your government personel except for the option to sack them, really your government seems to effect the game even less than losing your generals now. Lastly, there is paid DLC that should have been in the game from the start. Other than the warpath campaign there is no excuse for this obvious cash grab.  Overall though, this is a very good game and is very fun to play. I have truly enjoyed this game and would recommend this to anyone without a second thought. And like all Total War games that it's available for I highly recommend Darthmod after you've played this game and seen what it has to offer by itself. The mod ramps up the replay value and gameplay immensely. It also helps eliminate or reduce the frequency of the few bugs I've seen in this game.
5087	1	a	It was a time suck great game!
3992	1	a	They found the perfect balance of military strategy and political management for this genre. Incredibly buggy and slow at times but this game is just amazing. I personally think the sea battles blow. They are a slower version of the sea battles in Sid Meier's Pirates! Plus the campaign locks gameplay features until you beat it. However, those are the only bad things I can say about this game. It's a must have for the RTS junkie. Oh and the DLC is cool but not essential.
3682	1	a	great game must have for any total war fan
2229	1	a	Very good strategy game. Love the time preiod. AI can be abit average at times.
3071	1	a	one of the best games ever!!!!!!!!!!!
3270	1	a	the best Total War for me. It's a great era as it entails rifles as well as hand-to-hand weaponary so it has elements of all the best Total Wars. The graphics are outstanding and the gameplay top notch. The campaign is long and innovative if a little tricky. But for me the naval battles and multiplayer are the key parts.
5113	1	a	Fantastic space sim-ish game. Skill based ship combat and open world.
827	1	a	Great game, fun, entertaining. What could be better than roll over some overgrown orcs!
4803	1	a	If you like old school space shooters (asteroids) but like the story and graphics of modern space shooters (Halo) then this is the game for you
3036	1	a	I love the game but recentley ive been having trouble get into the game and I have no clue on what to do i tried deleting the game and reinstalling it but nothing has worked.
4548	1	a	SPaZ is kind of a throwback. Flying 2D spaceships and accepting missions is a lot of fun, and I have fond memories of other games of this type. This one, though, feels a little lacking in some areas. You get a decent variety of ships and weapons, plus a tech tree to spend your upgrade points on as you level up. There's a big galaxy map, except that all the systems feel kind of the same. There's only 4 factions (military, civs, and bounty hunters, plus the titular zombies that come in later on). Oh, and your reputation with 2 of these factions, instead of being global, is system-by-system, and randomly determined. So, you could hop into a new area wanting to do business with one of them, only to find out they hate your guts, and you'd have to take missions for them (or bribe them) in order to turn that around.  There are plenty of randomly generated missions to undertake, but aside from a few plot-related side missions these are all repeatable and repetitious. The main obstacles standing in your way are the warp gate blockades, preset enemies you have to fight to proceed to the next system, so a lot of what you're doing is just knocking these guys down to get from A to B. Sometimes you have to train up and get more resources to take on a tough outpost, but other than that..  The big draw here is the combat, and customizing your ships, outfits, and tech the way you want them. If you like 2-D spaceship-flying games, this'll be right up your alley. If not, there isn't a whole lot here that'll change your mind.
3588	1	a	Great strategy and simulation game.
4663	1	a	A fun top down space adventure survival game. Run missions and and engage in piracy on a quest to the galactic core researching, salvaging, and stealing technology and ship types all along the way. It is great fun to tweak and optimize ship combinations and weapon loadouts, as well as dump excess crew into the void of space when the 'zombies' breach your hull.
1455	1	a	Good game, the new UI needs some getting used to if you're familar with M2TW or RTW..   A must have for any TW fan.
2280	0	a	Nothing says fun like having your soldiers line up, or not controlling the recruitment of your agents.  The games released before and after (Medieval 2, and Shogun 2) were way better
354	1	a	
4682	1	a	Simple, addicting and fun to play. I just gonna play for a couple minutes aaannnd it's 1:00 AM.
2341	1	a	My favorite Total War of all time. They need to make an Empire 2!!
2698	1	a	Things I liked:  - Great gameplay! The Campaigns are highly customizable and there are always new things to discover. - The strategy in this game is awesome. The battles are very realistic and commanding your troops is fun! - I have an affinity for this game because of how explorable it is; from alliances to war, you decide your future.  There is nothing about this game that I didn't like. I would like to see one made for the 1800's!
4814	1	a	Definitely unique, the art is nothing to write home about but blasting through blockade after blockade is fun. For the first handful of times anyway. There is a perpetual grind in this game that really, REALLY grates after twelve hours.  It is fun! For a while. Looking past that, it is a good title I recommend. The gameplay and combat is sound with a wide variety of ships and a steady, worthwhile progression system. Oh and the story is top-notch, because it doesn't take itself seriously. Puns, jokes, and general asshattery abound.  If you plan on buying it, try the demo first, wait for it on sale, and maybe look out for the sequel.
5008	1	a	Space battles.. realtime mostly. And truly I have no idea why I enjoy this game so much. That and it's dirt cheap for another, oh, 20 minutes :-)
4529	1	a	This is a great game and honestly there should be more like it out there. Imagine my surprise at finding this game late (and on a great sale) and then hearing SPAZ 2 will be out soon! The gameplay is smooth and the battles are fast and fierce with beautiful graphics around you as you blow â¥â¥â¥â¥ up. Some of the missions are recycled often but when you're looking for new swag for your ships you just keep going. This isn't a game where you can rule the galaxy easily and destroy the AI you have to actually think as you play. I really appreciate the devs and the time they obviously put into this game. It's a blast!
2044	1	a	As with real-life Empires, this game is massive, occasionally unpleasant to look at (the usual wall maneuvering problems and suicidal A.I charging into the line of fire), but diverse; it sounds boring, but the diplomacy is a huge improvement on the previous games, and a proper tech tree actually allows choice where advances where previously given by passing x number of turns.  Huge and engrossing enough to overlook some of the loose threads that come out of the seams.
150	1	a	Guys this game so funny ) try it )
5118	1	a	Great space combat game. If you like customizing your ship, gathering resources, and making big explosions, you should check this game out.
2175	0	a	By far the worst total war game.   The ablity to recruit gun units and artillery seems moot when you consider the fact that you will win most battles in this game (on hard I might add) with Cavalry and bows and arrows.  Also... the voice acting is horrible, bordering on racist, but remains about the only thing that actually gave me a reaction other than bordem in this game.   Buy something good.  
3105	1	a	After a long day of school or work, what's better than beating up on some Redcoats? Take the Americas, Africa, Europe...the World! for any major power of the 18th and 19th Century. Large-scale strategy is unmatched by any other game than the Total War series. If you're a history buff or enjoy military tactic like me, you will enjoy this game immensely!
1986	0	a	This game could be good had it been more developed. The land combat is not bad in theory but its quite messy when possitioning units. The map is ok, but the minimap is very hard to read. The tutorial taught me nothing about the game only about the combat system, land to be exact. But the main reason why this game isnt good, the sea combat. Its so messy, so impossible to use. When you give an order to a specivic ship it wont always do what you told them. Somethimes it will in fact do something completely diferent. They move sooooo slow, while yes thats realistic its super boring. If you want to make this game realistic you shouldnt even be able to see any battles. So instead of making it partially realistic how about making it enjoyable.
3585	1	a	Add a little class to your games list. Yes You, you know who you are. With a unique take on the RTS genre, you no longer have an army of twenty units fighting war in a two mile box. Because really, why are the Aztecs fighting England in a tiny patch of desert? The whole world is yours to take if your ballsy enough. Or have enough cannons.
658	1	a	Very fun game, give the demo a try!
94	1	a	Brutal all the way. Must try
3081	1	a	This was the first game I ever purchased on Steam and it has been my favorite ever since!!!!!
1352	1	a	This game was one of my first steam games ever. I wouldn't call it an work of art, but the huge campaign map, the beatiful (for it's time) textures and the textbook correct nations are absolutly wonderful. The variety of nations you can playas, from the OP island nation of Great Britain, to the rebelling colonists in the American theartre, and the Rebelling Maratha faction in India, this game's wide, unique and colorful blend of nations and maps are truly something worth buying this game. This is one of the best total war games out there, especially if you love 18th century history. Works perfectly with Dathmod. I highly recomend you play vanilla first, however, just to get the feeling of the great game you just bought. The battle AI could use some improvment though, other than that, great game Sega/ Total War!!!
1193	1	a	Disciples always keep me for hours to play all series i love them!!! 
4929	1	a	Wow! Even better than I had thought. This game keeps you going ang going and going and... you get the point.
3636	1	a	a really cool game with cool details and models, but requires a good PC to run.
3312	1	a	very fun lots of historical accuracy and tactics
4113	1	a	Great game you should buy it.
3226	1	a	This game really does walk you through history and is very intellectual. I highly reccomend buying it, it's worth your money and you can play as every major country, so it is a long game if you play it all.
3333	1	a	Brilliant Game
36	1	a	Must have !
3700	1	a	Whilst this game is becoming outdated, it still has the base building, killem' attraction. It provides endless opportunities for players to enhance their strategy skills by using multiple countries armies and units.
2298	1	a	Excellent game. If you enjoy strategy that is all encompassing, this is the game for you. Very subtle nuances of the game continue to emerge, even after playing this game religiously since its inception. No finer product on the market.
1506	1	a	This is an amazing game if you love history and strategy. Although, it can get pretty weird sometimes, for example, i was Russia and for no reason whatsoever, England became a republic where the ruler was a Lord Protector, no idea what was going on there...  Overall it is one of my favourite games, even though it could have been a lot better.
1360	1	a	Empire was my first Total War game and still is the one I play today. With other 250 hours in single player its a game with immense re-playability. For players new to Total War or Turn based stategy with a real time element I would recommend picking up this game alongside its DLC.
1551	1	a	It is so fun and it is not to laggy You can do alot in it and is quite interesting
3863	1	a	Being a Big Fan of the 'Total War' Series.. I must give this game it's share in ackowledgement. Like all the other Total War games before and After this one.. Empire: Total War captures the Fun and Interesting idea of combat through a 'God-Like' view. Open Control to each and every unit you deploy. No matter how old this game may be, it'll always have a place in my and each fan's hearts. Definitely a game i'll be playing in the future!
315	1	a	Try it In MasterMode thats a GAME! of slash slash and BOOM! HEADSHOT! really worht it!
2203	0	a	Great game but i cant finish a game without it â¥â¥â¥â¥ing up...give me my money back! I had to dl it more then twice
2453	1	a	I never understood what all the hate was about. This is a great game, both the strategy and the battlefield aspects. Of course, I am a European history and culture buff, so it's a joy for me to see all my old friends live again.
5194	1	a	This game is 90% great and 10% rubbish. Its great when everything is going smoothly and you're rampaging around the galaxy killing stuff and its terrible when you get a certain map with an AI ship (in one of the fastest ships in the game) that shoots at you for a bit then runs off when it is near death, then comes back and shoots you again before running off. When you have done this for 10 mins straight you will hate this game as much as I do - however, with a bit of patience you will realise that you can re-fit your ships mid-match to allow you to catch the tricky bugger or use drones which are faster than most ships. .
1463	1	a	Well dispite constant bugs ni the AI  its ok i guess
134	1	a	Got it on sale, it is a great game to play when you are frustrated and need to calm down. I have 9 hours and am not even half way through, but I think I might be because I will only go to the next level if I get a perfect score.   I got it on sale, but I'd say it is worth the $10.
1300	1	a	This game is wonderful if your goal is to crush the American Revolution and see to it that Britain is the world super power forever. ALL HAIL GREAT BRITAIN.   10/10 would drink tea again.
407	1	a	Charming.  8/10, would get thrust awkwardly into a position of overwhelming responsibility again.
660	1	a	Great and addictive game. Worth to buy it.
1843	1	a	best total war
3521	1	a	Empire:Total War, a strategy game released in 2009 [cite] and set in 18th century Europe, India and America is a great start to the Total War series. Good graphics, detailed gameplay, easy (not always) difficulty, makes it good for newcomers. On the other hand, the AI CAN be rather stupid. On and Easy difficulty they will provide little challenge. Also, provided that your computer is slow, it may be a bit laggy. If this was a star rating, I'd give this game a 4.5 out of 5. Not perfect, but definetly a great game.
3221	1	a	best history game ever made
1643	1	a	One of the best Total Wars, with tons of big mods and best of all the first TW to get a multiplayer campaign!
1538	1	a	Great Co-op Features!
2704	1	a	I enjoyed this game very much, but it does not match the standard that Europa Universalis IV presents. Europa, however, is not as much about war, so if your main focus is war, this is the game for you. If you enjoy grand strategy, how about giving Europa a look?
1898	1	a	Overall, I'd give this game a Giant: Meh. It makes you feel immersed when You have Dragoons peeking on a hill into an small Rank of militia, but the imersion breaks when 3 or 4 seconds before they peak, your militia shoots at the ground infront of the hill. Or how the enemy is marching toward your fort, and the walls have been destroyed. What do you do? Obviously cluster â¥â¥â¥â¥ all of you troops into 2 houses and a church! Do that and you pretty much won. Or how the Only seiges on Towns in the game are scripted, like the Battle for Bunker hill at the begining of the American campaign.   And also, they don't even have Towns! They have a village and a Capital for each territory, and they are barely that. According to this game, A city can't have more than a Canonfoundry, Govenors Barracks, Weavers Cottage and Ironsmith without being too large. And a village, errr, Town can only have 1 building like a church or a school.   Other parts of the Campaign Map are terrible, too. The diplomacy takes 1 step forward to getting rid of diplomats, but 42 large train crashes backwards when you try to make a deal. Here's an example: I was doing an england game with scotland and ireland as protectorates. I captured algiers, and of course the riots and rebelions wouldn't stop. I decided to cut my loses and sell it to Ireland. I only asked for 7000 for it, but of course no. To put that into perspective, I had to pay 135,000 for bengal in one of my old american campaigns. So, I said â¥â¥â¥â¥ it and wanted it for millitary access. But, Nope.avi. So I decided I was 420% done, and just gave it to them, but still? No. What the actual â¥â¥â¥â¥.jpg   There are a few good points though. Mods will make the AI better, MUCH bettter. You can play as all factions with mods, also. The campaign MAP is huge. 2x the size of rome and medieval. The time it will take to take over the world is a long â¥â¥â¥â¥ing time. Look at how long I have been playing, I have only beaten the game 10 times, And I don't even have warpath, which adds another 20+ hours.    Overall, This game was a 6/10 for me. So, if you have Rome 1, Medieval 2 and Shogun 2, get this aswell. If not, get those first.
1787	1	a	it's the beast game of TW after Napoleon
4370	1	a	This is one of my favorite games of all time. I love this game.
5187	1	a	Don't let the simplistic design and humor fool you, this game can be very challenging at times. The difficultly curve is just right to prove enough challenge to keep things interesting and the progression keeps things fresh enough as to not become too repetitive or dull.   I love games that really give you a sense of progression and feel where your actions actually matter. The end-game micromanagement is just tough enough to keep you on your toes but not cause you to rage quit. If you like top-down arcade shooters, flying around as a pirate, managing your own fleet, saving the galaxy, or any combination there of, you should give this a look.
2492	1	a	Very fun game to play. AI can be frustrating at times, but the positives certainly outweigh the negatives. If you're a fan of strategy games, or action games, I can tell you you'll enjoy this. Whether it's conquering Europe in Campaign, or just having an all out slaughter in quick battle, this game will help pass hours.
673	1	a	This is the greatest orc massive murder of All Time.
4535	1	a	Shockingly fun little game, will absolutely provide bang for your buck.
3323	1	a	One of the best games i have ever played. It gots everything. The game play is awesome. A lot better than previous gameplays but the only problem is its complex but maybe to complex. I liked the Mediaval 2 total war campaign for reasons like it was complex but not to over the top to confuse. Overall this game is very fun and i can play for hours.
4069	1	a	This is what I call a 'Wine Game' a game in which you sit down and have a nice glass of wine while playing, While doing that I got half drunk (light drinker) then I unlocked my inner Prussian war lord and kicked the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of austria with little of my soldiers' deaths.
3613	1	a	I have lowered the graphics in the game to Low and have a computer with more than capable power in every form available and still am unable to play the game without a multicoloured screen. Such a good game to have a daft flaw.
583	1	a	Such an amazingly awesome &amp; addictive game, love it!!!
3596	0	a	bugs and issues. Code for getting thegame started is unworkable for the additional disk I have purchased. Not happy
3848	1	a	One of my fav total war games.... with Darthmod of course
2166	0	a	First of this is a long review but this is nothing but the truth about this game. I saw empire and i am kinda new to the total war franchise. i saw total war empire and i thought it would be a pretty decent game. I look up reviews on the game and sadly i saw a lot of hate. Now that was a long time ago and it has been a couple years since the game came out so i thought i would give it a go hoping all the bugs would be patched. I was wrong....... The game is a mess still after all these years! I thought they would fix the AI and all the bugs but nope! The AI are awful just a disaster. The AI run straight and run away from your troops and dont even attack. I spent an one hour playin ghtis game and I had to quit because the battle were so boring. I think the civil war is awesome and really cool but not like this when all the troops wont even attack and im standing there with one unit and still win the war because the army doesnt attack me.  Next the game is so bad it hurts to play the game. The map is a wreck, you get so much men to start out with so you can take over the cities right next to you and demolish them like no problem if they even let you blow down the doors since the cannons dont like moving after you shoot something and decide to shoot a hill instead of moving and attack the gates. The gameplay is so basic on the campaign map and doesnt give you those heart pounding moments like you have on medieval 2 or shogun 2. You start out with like 5 alliances and those alliances wont even help you. Instead they will just sit back while im getting my â¥â¥â¥ kicked by the french. I signed a treaty with you to help me not sit around and watch my city fall to some other faction you are also fighting! Next when you get higher in level it takes five hours just for all the factions to take there turns. Ive watched youtube more then i was playing the game waiting for my turn to come.  The concept is great rewriting history and not let america gain its independance or ally with america as the british and go crazy and fight the british or something. I was impressed with how much they gave a lot of detail on the battle grounds with the little stuff like rocks all over the place, broken down walls for your men to take cover behind while there firing bullets, forests to hide and set up ambushed and flanks on the enemy. The total war series does a fantastic job with units and how many units there are and how you can get some epic fights that take a long time like how it was back then. Sadly this game is missing so much that im actually sad that this is my first total war game i didnt like. I am still a big total war fan and will get all the games but empire was so bad and were missing so many key factors to make this game a good game and instead made this bad and not fun to play. Get shogun 2 or medieval 2 and lets hope that they will make a fun civil war game. Hope they do great concept just bad game. Ill be waiting sega! Make medevil 3 first ;)
5274	1	a	A procedurally generated space dogfighting game with a little bit of RTS micromanagement thrown in. While the story isn't the most in-depth you'll run across, SPAZ has enough content generated every time you load up a new universe to keep you on your toes every single playthrough.
1788	1	a	destroyed France immediatley 11/10
3746	1	a	A brilliant game, a brilliant concept, a lot of fun, until of course the renowned crashes come along. I have over 10 campaigns on this game but then it comes to the one where I have taken all of Europe and half of America in only 60 years as Britain then it corrupts the file! Brilliant game ruined by some bad programmers.
5104	1	a	It's very fun and addicting I might say. Even though it's quite repetitive, it makes you want to level up and explore every inch of the game. If you're underleveled in this game it really put you on a difficult spot to win. But that's also a challenge on its own so to me its a win win. There's also a lot of way you can go through galaxies. Stealth tech/Bombs/Turrets.. A LOT OF WAYS!!! That's the fun of it. For now I only use brute strength and upgrade engines and weapon upgrades but little do I know that other give me such a big advantage as well. If you're the kind of person like progression this would be it. Not to mention you can make other ships by reverse engineered the ones that you destroyed. Pretty cool system huh?? No longer you need to feel frustrated over a ship that's better than you.   Overall I would give this game 8/10, It's there but after a while it would get a bit of grinding spree since the ships that you fought sometimes overpowered you by a mile. (AND THOSE DAMNED BOUNTY HUNTERS!! GRAHHHHHH I HATE THEM SO MUCH!! YET THEY GIVE SO MUCH REWARDS!!)
2889	1	a	:)
1732	1	a	Decided its probably time to give E:TW a review considering I played this for lord knows how many hours on disc before I ended up getting it on Steam.  So, is it any good? Short answer...Yeah.  Pros: -Empire offers the biggest map (to my knowledge) out of most of the Total War games. Ranging from the Americas (North, the neighbouring islands, the head of South), Europe/North Africa, some of the middle east and India. There are also ship-only trade locations around indochina, africa and the americas which also add to the fun. -Loads of factions. -Even more emerging factions (All hail the might Norway which completely throttled my Russian Empire). -Nice range of units even without the DLC. -The Era itself is quite fun, this is the closest to a World War Total War game so its worth getting to try the vanilla version before getting the World War One mod. -Revolutions give you the chance to revolt..more importantly the chance to change your nations flag color (Sorry Maratha, it sucks though.)  Cons: -The diplomacy system..it just doesn't work. For example, Playing as Spain and all is going swell, offer trade with Persia. The game freezes for a moment and I wished it had of stayed frozen. Upon unfreezing, Persia demands 4 of my cities and offers 5 turns of military access....Why in the â¥â¥â¥â¥ would I want to send troops to Persia? -Copy Pasted villages. All the towns seem to look way too similar, I mean atleast in the American countryside the forests look different but other then that, it's like the Devs just kinda gave up. -Stupid Units. Stupid. Stupid. Stupid. STUPID. Seriously, the amount of times my troops shoot their own soldiers, run back and forward when ordered to charge or just REFUSE to walk into a building is irritating. -Rebellions. I mean, im a veteran at the Total War games, having played almost every one but I have to say, the rebellions in this seem more like the game going 'Meh, why not?' than logical 'tax is too high' or 'religious unrest' rebellions that happen in other games. I've had cities on low tax, religious building with preachers, no schools or colleges and nice pleasure gardens and even had both low and high amounts of troops...rebellions just seem to happen for no reason and they can really mess you up.  I'd give the vanilla game a 5/10, it's not a bad game but it has its flaws that can almost derail any pros.  WITH mods, game bumps up to a 7/10 Still recommend getting it though maybe wait for a sale.
4832	1	a	This is really a good game. And, it's only about 150MB to install. It's a space exploration, resource gathering, space combat strategy. I'm not much into RTS games, and this game doesn't play like one. You have a mother ship, and then control individual ships in your fleet. You can switch between any ship, and also set up AI for those ships you aren't currently controlling. The galaxy is proceedurally generated when you start a new game, and you can control the number of star systems up to about 300 total. Each star system has a level requirement before you can visit it, and you have to deal with the ships guarding the Jump Gates (bribe or destroy) before you can move freely between systems you have access to.  Really, try the demo. The tutorial is for the first system but seems to open up after about the 1st or 2nd mission you take. This 2 person dev team deserve your money.
3977	1	a	second best total war game
4689	1	a	If you were playing FTL and thought to yourself, 'This is great, but I need... MORE' Then Spaz is the game for you.  If you were playing Gratuitous Space Battles and thought to yourself, 'This is boring, I need... MORE' Again, Spaz is the game for you.  I want to stop playing it, but I can't. I have to conquer the galaxy, pirate-style. Incredibly addicting, and like FTL, ignore any and all dialogue. It's cute, but that's about it.  For $2, it's a must-have. For $10, you'll still get your money's worth. I give it an FTL out of GSB.
3683	1	a	awesome, the whole game works together to challenge you as a leader of the great powers of Europe. It allows you to go political, militry or economically focused and is well rounded on each path. Everything about this game is well made and although it is a bit slow if you haven't got a fast computer, it is still awesome to play. It makes you wonder what the new total war games are going to look like after this.  8.75/10
1630	1	a	If your a fan of depth, intrigue and tactical expertise this is it. DAMN AMAZING&gt; The field and sea battles are very good, flexible and always fun. Graphicallly exellent, especially with troop count at max. You might even learn a few things from the poignat qoutes from the rich and crazy over the years, to little known obscure events through the period 1700- onwards. Great Great Great. CoD lovers need not apply. Please, dont even think about it.
693	1	a	Loads of Orcs, Traps, and Maps make for a great 'Tower Defense' style game. The game doesn't take itself seriously at all which makes it even more fun &amp; the cartoon-ish Art Style gives the added benefit of some pretty awsome Death Faces on the Orcs! Go for it, especially on Sale!
919	1	a	One of the best games I have ever played... No, I'm lying about that, it isn't... But it is a nice idea for a game and hell yeah it's funny. The only thing that is missing - level creator. I would probably have around 200 hours of it right now if it did.
1257	0	a	Interesting concept and gameplay but nothing there to make you want to continue playing after an hour.
1394	1	a	The british navy is the most famous and languished naval power in history. It has boasted such military victories as Trafalgar, and has been attributed with inventing many of the military ideals most modern navies still use today. Their crews are well trained and proud.   And you can wipe them out with a single Spanish Galleon, which never, ever stops being funny.
1301	1	a	- Play as the mighty dutch - Trade Ceylon for Flanders - Realize my mistake - Take over the pirates - Build Caribbean empire and large navy  - Take over all trade theaters - Be super rich - Buy more ships - Realize it's 1799 and I haven't conquered a single European province - Prussia owns all of Europe - 10/10 would get super rich again
603	1	a	Now this is a fun game! Combining stragegy and planning with frantic combat and dark humor this is easily one of the indie games I've enjoyed the most over the past few years. I could easily see this doing well on PSN or Xbox Live (if it isn't already).
3785	1	a	Incredible in-depth game. Everything you could want in a colonial-era game and as it's total war, you know it's good! Napoleon: Total war provides the small improvements to things such as diplomacy and battle effects to make it a near perfect game in my opinion.   Just look at my gaming hours, that'll tell you more than any long winded review will!
1585	1	a	Not the best total war in term of battle, but the map design is great and the city management is good to. I had fun playing this game and conquering UK with the Indiens.
1719	1	a	I played this game when it's free for a weekend but I bought Napoleon however. Still I'm looking forward to see Empire 2
4499	1	a	Awesome game! Cheesy portraits and 'acting' but amazing and simple dynamics.  It is hard to find games like this. Spaceship RPG with customizable ship arsenal. Sandbox like maps and quirky storyline.  It would be great to see additional weapons and support addons for the ships as well as extended storyline and new ship models.
636	1	a	Funny, hectic, the first time I've seen someone manage to make a first person tower defence game worth playing.
2463	1	a	Great historical Game!
1291	1	a	The only game where you can invade Russia , in the winter.
442	1	a	Very refreshing combo of Tower Defense, Hack and Slash and a tiny bit of RPG. The style's also very cool. Orc-hating cartoonish stuff. Looks great
3252	1	a	The last good total war game?  The AI is still â¥â¥â¥â¥ and the only way to make it hard is to allow them to cheat.  I would like more control over politics and marriages for example.
1980	1	a	  Introduction
3048	1	a	  Best history manual.
1408	1	a	This is the Total War that got me hooked.....after this game i ended up getting most of them including the packs...
709	1	a	This game is really fresh and original. Everything about it is great. Highly recommend it!
2941	1	a	Great game what more can be said,UP THE RED COATS
1170	1	a	A very tentative recommendation. Do not play if: - You are heavily discouraged by poor unit balance - The stupid physical immunes from Disciples II were your bane - You expect the enemy AI to actually do anything on the overworld map - You expect experience proportionate to challenge - You expect the highest point in the challenge curve to be late-game rather than right at the beginning  That last point is the real issue. Early-game heroes are weak as day-old kittens - no more being the equivalent of a tier 2 from the start! - and the neutral units seem heavily biased toward a fast hero with high accuracy. Meanwhile, at the end of a campaign you'll stomp through the highest tier enemies like they weren't even there. Which is very cathartic.  All of the elements of a good Disciples game are here - the gothic setting, the glorious art, the sudden but inevitable betrayals. I'd say it's worth playing for those times when the balance sits just right.
316	1	a	One of the funnest Tower Defense games to be had outside of WC3 / SC2 mods.
3117	1	a	Out of the whole entire Total War series to date as January, 20th, 2014 is the most extensive in terms of covering the Globe. By covering the globe land terroritories in North America all the way to the Northern parts of South America, Europe, Northern Africa, and the Middle East connecting into India, and also multiple islands in multiple waters such as the Caribbean Sea, Atlantic Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, and also the Indian Ocean. Also uses Maritime Sea trade routes that require building two types of Navies: Merchant Trade Fleets and Fleets full of Warships for protection and to fight other Empires/Nations and even Pirates for trade route ports. The Sea Trade routes include the following locations: the Coast of Brazil (South America), Ivory Coast (Southwest Africa), Madagascar (Southeast Africa), and also the East Indies (South Pacific). Plus a good game to help learn a little History and Geography. Empire: Total War is a good game to help assist in the learning of the Era in History we call the 'Enlightenment' that helped shaped the modern world that we live in. Will you follow history or will you create your own alternative history of the time period?
4412	1	a	If you like STR, you HAVE to pocess all the Sega games (from this one to the CoH ones)
3656	1	a	If you love battle, strategy games, this is the game for you. Very fun and brain stretching. However, if you're going to play this game, make sure your computer has the system requirements, because mine doesn't and it lags SO badly. Despite the lag, this is the game with the potential to be the best strategy game.
1856	1	a	The only and best line battle simulator on the Steam store :P  Variety of factions to play from including five Native Tribes: Iriquois, Pueblo, Cherokee, Plains, and Huron Wyndot. Not to mention the fierce Ottoman Empire   Authentic and detailed naval battles and simulation for those classic wooden, sail, and cannon warships used in the 18th century  Active multiplayer community  Plenty of interesting and relevant quotes in the loading screens; loading screens are beautiful too  Graphics still hold up for a 2009 game   Though, the AI runs away constantly in the Warpath campaign, and siege battles become redundant as the AI won't utilize the walls. Also note, some people like to spam artillery and light dragoons and light infantry, resulting in hit and run  Recommend at base price or bundles that include all the DLC
1328	1	a	 Empire: Total Warâ¢
1721	1	a	Lately this game isnt wanting to work for me and several of my friends. I would recommend it though. Great game. Instant classic
4729	1	a	Earlier it came to my attention that none of my friends own this game, so I am here to inform. Space Pirates and Zombies is an open-world, 2D space-themed shooter and everyone should buy this game. Not only is it amazing that a team of two created this, but they did a really good job on it. They did a better job than some large game corporations have done on games before. Amazing combat, soo much to do, hilarious dialogues, really cool story, and you have ultimate control of how you get to point B. You can power your way through, or take your time and get everything one step at a time, just depends how you like to play. This game is for all styles of gamer and you should get it! (The intro screen made me type that D:)
167	1	a	This game is an absolute riot and blast to play. No MP support, but the SP game is a ton of fun and some of it is extremely challenging.
4473	1	a	This game is still a masterpiece. Probably one of the best RTS games ever released.
989	1	a	i got this for 3â¬ and spend 40 hours of tactical orc slashing, optimizing my trap arrangement. it's fun, buy it. if you like tower defense, this is what you want.
3412	1	a	Cannons and the Muskets.... Brah this game is the â¥â¥â¥â¥!
3809	1	a	Every man has a stick and they poke each other with this stick. you control these stick pokey men with the goal of poking as many of the other men as possable. sometimes they dont even need to poke them with the stick! they just lift it up and yell 'BANG!' and its like they were poked with the stick!  Some men ride on cars, but they have legs for some reason. while they do that they have a shiny stick that they also try to poke others with.  then there are these things that are labeled 'abillery' or something. I dont like them. you cant poke other people with them. they just make an even louder 'BANG' noise and shoot a black fisbee that doesnt seem to go anywhere. and even if it does land in the enemies place they all just seem to enjoy a slumber party afterward.   all in all, I like it. its a great stick poking simulator. I had no idea it was a real thing!  8/10 would poke again!
4464	1	a	Age of Empires III: Complete Collection is a real-time strategy game from Ensemble Studios and published by to what now Microsoft Studios. It is a sequel to the Age of Empires franchise. Age of Empires III: Complete Collection also contains both expansion packs from Age of Empire III.  Age of Empires III saw many improvements and feature upgrades in term of gameplay while retaining the unique play of Age of Empires series. Many new features included are the new home city and card deck. Card deck allows you to call many abilities such as reinforcements of units, resources delivery, unique upgrades delivery and many more from home city to your new colony. Age of Empires III takes place in the new world of America. You will be seeing units such as the Musketeer, Dragoon, Minuteman and many cannons. Another new features added here is a trade post. Trade post can be built on trade routes or local tribes such as the Aztec to gain their allegiance and lets you train their unique units.  Graphics in Age of Empires III is definitely far better improved and upgraded than the previous Age of Empires, far better effects, models and textures, shaders, everything is beautiful and fully detailed in this game. Performance is also great, no issues that can ruin your play.  Seeing that many Microsoft games such as the Age of Empires II or Age of Mythology has been upgraded with Steamworks feature, Age of Empire III should see that support too, since this is the latest Age of Empire series.  Age of Empire III: Complete Collection is a great game to play, I recommend this.  Rating 9/10
521	1	a	A good game.I like it so much...i want to buy the Orcs must die 2.
915	1	a	its a nice game
2751	1	a	Great game. But all the total wars are.
1816	1	a	There is no game that i've played so much for so long, just so awesome!
3622	1	a	Good game. Since I bought the game I was hoping for more 'free' DLC?
3571	1	a	Empire is a awsome game for people who like strategy and old war combat. It has a very large campaign map and the Road to Independance Campaign is very well made. I also like the extra content packs , they make the game expirience even better.
4878	1	a	This game is a wonderful blend of action, role playing, and horror elements.  You are part of a crew trying to get rich in the universe while generally aiding the local police/military forces (UTA) or rebels trying to shut them down (Civ). The entire game revolves around you doing pretty much whatever you want, but never making that easy.  The variety of ships is sure to appeal to pretty much everyone (Carriers, Battleships, Gunboats, and even a few cargo vessels) and the combat and ship customization is very, very well done.
73	1	a	This is actualy a really neat game :D the hurmor so far is pretty funny, the gameplay is exceedingly fun, and really makes for a good mix of stratagy and action! so if you like tower defense, violance, and action (run around and shashing up stuff/shooting stuff..) games this is a fun game to get :D
4987	1	a	Strangely compelling once you get into it
1178	1	a	previous chapters were awesome, so i decided to buy the newly released part. I enjoyed it, as i am a fan of the line, but unfortunately this part has a number of lags and it`s not improving, the deweloper doesn`t do anything, anyway, if u are a fan as well u`ll love it
3139	1	a	This game features empires from the 1700-1800 era. All the patches that have been added since release helped it improvment. It features a turn-based campaign map with lands to explore and conquer ranging from the Americas, all the way to India and North Africa. And when 2 armies clash on the campaign map, you can fight the battle in a 3D real time strategy map controlling musket infantry and cavalry, to artillery and sword-wielding eastern infantry. 10/10
86	1	a	Epic Fun with a unique twist. An original game concept done well.
1235	0	a	I got this game and it gave my computer some kind of major error. So be careful if you get this game.
1261	1	a	Interesting concept where you dive inner(or outer) from yourself, an enemy or power up in order to make the subject in question weaker, stronger or different in order to get to the 'next level'.  Once you figure out the concept of the game... well, that's pretty much it. There is no story so going through each 'level' is pretty much like playing in an arcade, where you are just going for the points. That's not a bad thing, but for me, I wish there was more.  I still recommend the game due to the fact that it has a VERY unique gameplay system. If anything, this game is still worth the trip, even if it is just for a little while!
1023	1	a	Great game
5203	1	a	Great game - the trailer shows the gameplay perfectly.  You will have lots of fun playing this game and there will be moments where you genuinely LOL(such as when your cannons blast a hole in an enemy ship and a whole crapload of their crew get squirted out into space, wriggling like maggots.. then get squished by another passing ship). The start is a bit slow but once you've opened up several star systems and obtained blueprints to your first large ship it picks up momentum; once you start collecting blueprints for huge ships it really shines. Another recent reviewer complained about spending half his time mining - you only need to do that very early on, after that it becomes a pastime to blast enemy ships and scoop up what's left of them to get rich.  The cons: you may get very addicted!

4119	1	a	Great game, I would recommend it to anyone who likes history!
5210	1	a	I loved it all the way through, can't wait for SPAZ 2!
1213	1	a	Reincarnation is how Disciples III should have been in the first release. Itâs the best Disciples experience so far IMHO after Disciples II, with a much better tactical system, advanced graphics, another great atmospheric soundtrack along with more detailed RPG elements on commanders. So as some others also expressed in other comments, it is truly an advanced Disciples II on every end.   It is indeed a pity the studio bankrupted and couldnât last long enough to continue improvements over its current state. Even though most bugs are fixed, it is missing the unfinished but crucial DLC i.e. Mountain Clans which was an essential part of all previous Disciples sagas, therefore, limiting your overall experience with the game. This is the only reason why I cut off 1 point of my total score =&gt; 9/10   A true disciples fan should not miss this one in their collection. 
987	1	a	This is a brilliant core defence/tower defence mixed with action combat. With the well thought out ability to upgrade perks within the levels, high customisation of object placement and damaging objects already built into the maps ready for you to trigger; this is a must have title for any core defence lovers.  The only downside I have found so far is the inability to foresee what is coming on the next wave so you can plan accordingly.
314	1	a	Very fun and underrated game.
3842	1	a	Great game 10/10  
5171	1	a	If you're a fan of retro style top-down shooters with space themes and RPG progression elements SPAZ is a good bit of fun. That said, if you're the type that becomes frustrated with unbalanced and in some cases broken ability trees I would avoid SPAZ (and any sequels) until it becomes sufficiently cheap for you to not care.
2993	1	a	I am obsessed with this game. This is by far-- in my estimation -- the best of the Total War Games.   Some of the battles can be a bit quirky, but other than that, pure gold. Highly recommended.
4577	1	a	Really??? Zombies and Space, How could you want anything else?
5303	1	a	  Fun combat with nice strategic ship design.
4310	0	a	its a strategy game
4089	1	a	So many hours gone
4487	1	a	+RPG levelling +Wide-variety of ship types +Physics-based movement for both ships and projectiles/missles +Easy-to-learn resource management +Dark humored  -Grind intensive (if under utilizing the civvy station types) -Sub-Par AI teammates -Low variety of equipment types -Low variety of levelling skills (that is, no branching)  Listen, this game is fun as hell. Despite my minuses up there, there is still some variety and strategy to be had. It starts off fast and still really picks up. Even though there's a low variety of equipment, it still feels like there's always another ship to unlock or skill to level up.  The best way to increase the life of this game is the mods. Fight for Universe is easily the star, but Big Fight for Beef is also very good.  Even though SPAZ 2 is out, this is still definitely a buy.
1453	1	a	I LOVE THIS ONE So Epic Game
4827	1	a	I spent a fair amount of time with this version and pre-Steam version, combat is lots of fun with missiles, turrets and mining, game is very atmospheric, and you feel like you are in the groove in the early game. Then.. zombies. Difficulty curve goes way, way up, you die frequently, and start getting stuck in bottlenecks in the map where you have to defeat near-impossible odds to progress. Still, it won't be the first game I never finished but thoroughly enjoyed my time with until it beat the tar out of me.   Great game, sequel please....
2620	1	a	This is one of my favorite games of all time. I would recommend this to anyone.
3243	1	a	If you are looking for a fast paced quick fix game, you are looking in the wrong place. If you are looking for an easy to play strategy game, you are looking in the wrong place. If you are looking for a game that has historical accuracy, tense gameplay and epic battles, you are looking in the right place.
5311	1	a	After some 1,400 hours on the game, I can say with FULL VALIDITY this game has ruined my life. If you like realistic physics, teamwork, and every form of warfare, this game is for you. 10/10
219	1	a	Its a must buy because:  - game is cheap - game is cool - game is fun - achievements are reasonable - can be play as casual or more hardcore
4656	1	a	Simple, easy-game to learn how to play that is engaging, thrilling, and full of plenty of explosions. You could call it a simple, mindless shooter, however the way the developers present the story-line, different quests and plenty of gear-ships to experiment with, I would give it more credit than a simple shooter. PS: cannot wait for SPAZ 2 (please have workshop)
1194	0	a	Sorry no. This game just doesn't have enough gameplay to warrant even a single campaign playthrough. I guess they blew their entire budget on graphics, and forgot the important bits. I understand there are not a whole lot of games with turn based strategy, so you might be inclined to give this game a try just like me, but you'll be very disappointed with this game.
981	1	a	good and fun game. * * * *
2932	1	a	The game is good but has some AI issues. Modding is heavily recommended once you get used to playing.
4096	1	a	Game is fun, the controls are jsut a bit different than previous total war games because most units are ranged units, but i loved the game so much i watched the patriot 3 times O_o
2042	0	a	the battle is way to easy to play :\ and the cavalry srsly suxks 
317	1	a	This game is REALLY fun.
4130	1	a	great but frustrating game
1497	1	a	Very good, get darth mod, makes the game amazing
2602	0	a	DO NOT BUY!  This game is impossibly broken still, after all these years... The AI makes little sense most of the time, but by far the worst are the siege battles. Most battles they sit outside my walls refusing to attack, only occasionally sending one or two units forward to die. This means your game session has what basically comes down to 20-minute pauses every single time someone sieges your cities, while you sit there fast-forwarding...  Equally annoying is the RNG auto-resolving battles. It doesn't matter at all how large your force is or by what margin you could win if you fought the battle yourself; you can easily end up losing 1000 troops to a 300-strong enemy force if the RNG gods demand it!  To top it off there are actually performance issues on my 2-month-old and very powerful new PC. This COULD have been a good game, but is badly let down by its stupid AI. This has completely turned me off ever buying another Total War game...   DO NOT BUY!
4545	1	a	Such a fun and challenging game. Definitely worth the purchase.
3398	1	a	This title is a must for fans of real time strategy and turn based games, although the AI controlled enemy can be dull and predictable at times the battles are mostly engaging and cinematic. Detailed management of your military and settlements and diplomatic relations with other factions make the experience very immersive.
5243	1	a	It's well phat, mate.
1081	1	a	These orcs must die, will you aid us?
2545	1	a	Second best out of all second generation total war series.
3878	1	a	one of the best games i have ever played. every single time you start a new game, its different.
3005	1	a	It is a nice game, but Napoleon is, as far as I see, better.
5016	1	a	very fun, and some of the mods acctually work.
572	1	a	WAY fun and very addicting!
1359	1	a	Love this game, as you can tell by the hours I have on record. For me I enjoy the time period so that's why I got the game. Being a history buff, this game really helps me live out the time period, I don't see any cons what so ever. If you're a fan of history and love a stragey game, Then I HIGHLY recommend this game.
2303	1	a	One of the best in the series, really took Total War to a new level.
4623	1	a	I really enjoy this game. I'm normally one of those wimps who only plays on the easiest settings but this game only gets better the hard you make it. Max the bounty hunters and the difficulty level and you will enjoy the fight of your life.
2883	1	a	Is an intance game to play and the campaign is inspirate from real life and the online is very excite
58	1	a	It's very fun, but I'm mostly just writing this for the coal.
3488	1	a	One of the best RTS-TBS hibrids and the 3rd best of the TW series. A very exciting era, still amazing graphics, authentic sounds, a range wide of units, different cultures, enourmous theather and plenty of hours to waste :). The diplomacy is the best, better than in any other TW game.  I think it would be great to have some other playable factions, but it's still fine. If you missed it so far, now you must give it a try. 
2021	1	a	This is a great game if you love military type stuff it is an amazing game totally recomended
2944	1	a	It is great
338	1	a	Very fun game, simple but great visuals. Tower defence-ish but with an 'in the field' style gameplay makes the challenge in running around to different areas of the map on foot to lay down traps as well as taking on the fight yourself with the orc horde. Very addicting with short levels that just keep comming one after another. Traps are varied as are the enemy types, fun to be had by all.
2936	1	a	One of the best Total Wars, to bad the online community is gone
376	1	a	I'm loving all these games that take the defense genre and make it a bit more interesting. So much so that I can't even call the category 'tower defense' any more.  Orcs Mus Die is a third-person shooter defense game. You lay traps for the orcs, then once they start coming, you use your sword and crossbow to kill the ones that get past the traps. Solid conttrols, good gameplay, quirky humor and an interesting spin on the genre.
1514	1	a	One of my favourite Total war Series because its consist of Europe,Asia,Afrika and The New World. Great gameplay and graphic
5322	1	a	I played Altis Life and a cop arrested me because I said I was black. 10/10 so realistic.
1565	1	a	To me, this was the best in the Total War series until we got to a few games after. No matter what they say about the issues, it allowed me to go and conquer the world. And I personally love the 18th Century style warfare.
3480	1	a	Ive already spent over fifty houra on this and i plan to triple it before i move on to the next campaign option,
1687	1	a	great game 
2279	0	a	Not the worst total war game, not the best. I would definetly call it forgetable, you want a total war game? Go buy shogun 2, Rome 1, medieval 2...
1302	1	a	Personally, i throughly enjoy this game. It has a greatly expanded campaign map, tons of factions, and a much better diplomacy interface. On the downside, the AI is rather difficult, and often borders on(and crosses into...) being incredibly dumb. Battle mechanics are great, with better UI, better graphics, and expanded options. I like the 'take cover' selection that allows units to hide in buildings, or next to fences. They handled the change from melee-based combat, with little 'ranged combat', to a system with very nearly soley 'ranged' combat mecanics very, very well. The addition of Naval Battles is an extrordinary change, as all previous games had the 'autobattle' for sea combat(or in the case of med 1, random battles popping up as 'events' against the primarily land-based campaign), and i throughly enjoyed learning how to command such a sea battle. If you're looking for a TW game, or even just a nice game to play, and one that will not be a 'short play-through', then i heartfully recomend ETW.  10/10 for me.
4511	1	a	+fine space shooter with some fleet management +nice sound and visuals  -ui isnt scaling with resolution, forcing you to play in some low res matching your screen ratio -quite grindy and repetitive after a while
3898	1	a	Would have enjoyed this game more if the poor people would stop whinging every 5 seconds about their tax
918	1	a	It's really fun, definitely worth playing.
1925	1	a	I liked the Shogun Total War games as well as this one, but i thought Empire was a little more fun.
1863	1	a	Definately one of the better titles in this series.
2819	1	a	Great game all around! Hours of fun gameplay! 
3565	1	a	This is a good game. 
1322	1	a	I don't understand all the hate for this particular title. Probably my favourite TW game.
2825	1	a	Conquered america and my game got deleted. 10 / 10
1002	1	a	This game is very, very entertaining, the objective of the game is to kill orcs, gnolls, kobolds and ogres before they reach the end of the level. We could say this is a light game as is easy to win, however, for getting the perfect mark is another history. Is a strategy game as you can choose which traps, spells and special guardians to use for each level and you can upgrade them as you got better marks in each level. However, if you play in the nightmare mode, the strategy gives places to your skills as everything will change and will be very challenging to finish the game, and worse if you try to get a perfect mark in each level.  More is not enough to say, the game is very addictive, sarcastic history, and probably will be enjoyed by everyone. Thought is a good idea to get all the DLC in one single bundle as will help you. 
5048	1	a	Arcade style combat with RPG elements. Ship armaments, different ship styles, massive map, questing, factions. Has a lot for $5. Good ambient radio communication... this is important for some people? Seems to have a fair number of little surprises.
2000	0	a	Not that good but playable
4795	1	a	This is a pretty good game for old school fans of games like Escape Velocity. Unfortunately the game doesn't do a very good job at immersing you like some of those older games do. The universe feels pretty shallow, and some of the tackier interface and portrait artwork can break immersion. Although many aspects are quite antiquated, the combat system is its redeaming factor, and is the primary focus of the game. I would suggest starting with a smaller sized galaxy since progressing through the game's story can drag on a bit and require more grinding otherwise.
3300	1	a	shoot all natives in the faceto win the game
867	1	a	Is there better way to spend night than slice hordes of orcs? Probably yes, but it wouldnât be so fun. This is one of games which gave me most fun of all games I played. It has proper mixture of action, fun, creativity and humour. It is not too hard to finish, but same time enough challenging. It has great replayability because offers almost endless possibilities to combine traps and spells to get better score. Game is cheap even at full price, and if you get it on sale as I was it is bargain.
3181	1	a	I love the way this game has been made. The real-time battles (both land and naval ones) are simply incredible and the Grand Campaign (where you select a nation and you conquer like everything) is one of my favourite features. Also being a huge fan of the Prussian Empire makes me like this game even more, since it's in the game XD
678	1	a	Great tower defense style of game with a large variety of traps to get you through the levels. Having a third person character to aid your traps adds to the fun.
3663	1	a	I just thought of a great idea! Instead of ending the research and technology at a certain time period. You could instead continue the research to modern day and the future. Allowing this would make this game a whole lot more popular. It could actuallly be able to compete with Civilization too, because Civ.5 has randomly generated maps and the countries don't act like the actual country would in RL. Empire: Total War has a real map with realistic acting nations. The one thing you need to actually start beating Civilization is a larger range of tech/research.
682	1	a	I played the crap out of this game on my friends xbox 360 and loved every minute of it.  Pros: Orcs Must Die is just witty, funny, entertaining, strategy driven tower defense with a 3rd person shooter slapped on top of it, utilitizing traps to push back hordes of orcs and other monsters . This game is just great 100%.  Cons: Honestly there is no cons to this game that I find worth mentioning.  Overall: 9.9/10 because on warmaster this game is intense.
5013	1	a	Fun, very open universe. Gives you a lot of freedom to explore, destoy, and build.
213	1	a	Orcs and more need to die.  Traps traps traps, kill kill kill Good fun.
2838	1	a	And now the drums beat up again For all true soldier gentlemen.  Let us list and march, I say, Over the hills and far away.  Over the hills and o'er the main Through Flanders, Portugal and Spain. Queen Anne commands and we obey. Over the hills and far away.
3408	1	a	This is a good game. It's really good. The turn-based strategy makes it feel similar to a game like Civilization V, and the real time battles make it feel like a more in-depth version of Crusader Kings II. It's a mixed bag of games, a combination of several styles. It's fun to play as well, especially with mods. Several people say that it's buggy, that it doesn't work right. I've never had a problem with it, but I've also never played any other Total War games to compare it to. I suppose after seeing some YouTube vids on other Total War games, they might be a tad better, but this is a great game regardless. It's got cool history and awesome battles, a must-have if you're an 18th century warfare fan.
2065	1	a	I dont know why people say it failed, you probably can tell by how long ive played it.  Here is what i do to succefully win global domination.  &gt;Start as spain. &gt;Research as fast as i can. &gt;Train peasants to fight and make them cazadores. &gt;Win with peasant cazodores.  10/10 would win with peasants again.
328	1	a	A lot of games try to blend tower defense and action-based gameplay. This is one of the few titles that actually pulls it off, with a quirky sense of humor to boot.  On the other hand, the game is rather short, and could use moddability and/or custom levels. Replayability is, accordingly, rather limited.
3262	1	a	Best TW I've played so far, but that might be a fairly biased statement considering the setting.
3666	1	a	I really enjoy this game, its perfect for those who love to control massive armies.
634	1	a	A really good, entertaining and challenging game with a lot of replay value that will test your true abilities in the tower defense genre. It is a game that doesn't hold your hand at all and can only be truly mastered by practicing and playing the game through trial and error, how it should be in my opinion. A definite buy for any lover or tower defense games.
5316	1	a	Recommending this game is a no-brainer. If you are even marginally into shooters with a nag for realism Arma 3 is inevitable. The game won't let you in easily; it has a steep learning curve, and starting out can be quite frustrating. Also, you are less likely to find good public servers; it hardly is hop-on and play like CoD or Battlefield.   The best way to experience it is in a clan or community group. Groups range from run-and-gun type gameplay up to strictly milsim stuff, so there should be something for everybody.  Bottom line, go get it. It's unique, in every aspect.
1312	0	a	This game can be a lot of fun, but there are so many little annoyances that all add up to create an insanely frustrating experience in the vanilla version of the game (if you want to avoid half of the mess, download Darthmod to fix many of the bugs that Creative Assembly has kindly left in the game). This game has been patched more than my old pair of highschool jeans, and yet, diplomacy and declarations of war are still seemingly decided by the toss of a coin, rather than the global situation. Increasing the difficulty level doesn't even make things more demanding on the battlefield (The AI has the mental ability of a toddler, even on the very hard setting) but on the campaign map, someone decided that making the game 'challenging' on higher difficulties involves every nation declaring war on you at the same time very early on for no reason. Difficutly should be based around the player's skill level and their ability to complete REALISTIC objectives - Having every nation jump on you like the crabs of a million â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s, does not meet this criteria. Furthermore, the only way I'm able to reliably establish trade with other nations is for me to offer the technological equivilent of a thermonuclear weapon, in exchange for the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing wheel. If you're patient, and you enjoy 18th century history and warfare like I do, then please play this game with mods enabled to avoid a headache. Otherwise, play Shogun 2, or any of the previous Total War games as they are far superior to this game.
4998	1	a	A lot of fun for such a low price. A bang for your buck if there ever was one.
55	1	a	Some games you can tell are going to be good from the first 10 minutes of playing them. Orcs Must Die is one of those games. From the moment you start playing, its slick presentation becomes very apparent, ranging from a charming artstyle, to nice fast-paced music, and a comedic tone.   But presentation is not the only thing where the game shines. As a tower defence game it has some pretty ingenious trap ideas, such as trapdoors that release scorching flames, spring pads that launch orcs into the air, as well as acid bombs and even knights and archers. The level designs are also very well made, at times providing very obvious spots for where traps are ideal. And in addition to traps, you also unlock weavers, which are sorceresses that provide you with passive skills for the duration of the level. Upgrading these skills makes either your abilities or your traps/guardians more effective at what they do.  At the end of each level, you get a score (which is shown against scores of people on your friends list) and a rating out of 5 skulls. You can then use the skulls to upgrade some of your traps.  Overall the game was loads of fun. I've had a blast. Perhaps the only minor criticism I have is that when starting a new level that has more than 1 enemy entrances, it's often impossible to tell where the enemy is going to come through first. But it's a very small nitpick. The game is fun. If you like tower defence genre, get it now.
2455	1	a	One of the best strategic games ever made.
765	1	a	Ever played a tower defense game and thought to yourself; if only I could go and intervene when â¥â¥â¥â¥ happens. Well if so then this is the game for you. Funny and chaotic. Its addictive as â¥â¥â¥â¥, much like most tower defense games. I had tons of fun with it.
639	1	a	Genuine, 100% organic, sincere, long-forgotten fun with a dash of dark humor. Best buy-2011.
1200	0	a	I love 4x games but I'd rather play HOMM 3 or 5 for the millionth time that waste my time here. I'm incredulous that this is a game that has had three expansion packs because it doesn't even have a single player mode. Yep, your options are to play the simplistic campaign or a hotseat or network multiplayer game.   I'm a gamer so I don't like when game companies go out of business but if this is representative to the games they made it is no loss they are gone.  Something I just noticed is pretty much nobody has any real hours into this game. That should speak louder than anything else.
4362	1	a	Still one of the most entertaining Total war games, for its size, and gameplay, sure sometimes buggy but most of the time great material to burn through days of gameplay, especially in vombination with Darthmod etc...
4594	1	a	If you have not bought this game, wtf are you waiting for?
2830	1	a	No matter what, still the classic game it will be for ever. The MODDING community has done a great job of bringin g this game up to a par un equaled in the gaming genre of RTS.
2682	1	a	All Total War games are the best. Like strategy? Then love this!
5150	1	a	Great game, rare to find good space shooters
3348	1	a	Invade your enemies! Invade your neighbours! Invade your friends! Invade your family! Take over the world with genocide!
2688	1	a	Review for Empire Total War  Empire Total War is a epic Grand Strategy game that features Real Time battles. Empire Total War in itâs release state was a disgrace to the Total War franchise. But since launch, Empire has improved to a very playable and fun game.   The game is based in the 18th century with the game starting in 1700 and ending in 1800. The gameâs main focus is on the Real Time battles but it features more Grand Strategy than previous Total War games.   The Real Time battles are a joy to watch and play. But there are some problems with the battles, the most glaring is the AIs lack of strategic ability. I have had the AI knock down their own walls with cannons during siege battles.   The Grand Strategy part of the game is deeper in my opinion than any previous Total War game. In the Grand Strategy mode you can control your nation by doing various things like upgrading minor and major towns or hiring new ministers.   The diplomacy can be extremely annoying with the AI not giving you the technological equivalent of the wheel for a ballistic missile sometimes.   To fix most of these problems you can download the Darthmod mod. Darthmodâs main improvement is the AI. with darthmod even on medium difficulty the AI can be brutally efficient. Darthmod also increases the troop count to make bigger battles. Darthmod also adds smaller graphical improvements like musket and cannon smoke not dissipating for a long time.   Summary: This is a very fun Grand Strategy/Real Time Strategy hybrid that will deliver countless hours of enjoyment. It is worth every penny of $19.99, but if you arenât sure about it you can download a free demo that showcases the battles.   
773	1	a	This is an awesome game. And this is coming from someone who despises tower defense games.
2370	1	a	i like all total wars games but i yet to see a World war 1 or world war 2 total war now this is mods but the people that made the game should make a new game base off the world war
3021	1	a	10/10
4445	1	a	My Aztec navy destroyed the Spanish and British fleets  10/10
1815	1	a	Great total war game, always find myself coming back to it. Was a mess when first released but with the patches and some good mods this game can be excellent. Definitely recommend.
1238	0	a	I love every kind of Tower Defense games and I would probably love iBomber Defense IF... yes, there are many bad things. Starts very slow, every each of level is slow and that goes from beggining to very end of game. Not many different enemies, those are same in every level. You can't switch to other window while playing because the game will be paused - WHY WOULD YOU DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT IN DEFENSE TOWER GAME WHERE EACH OF WAVE IS GOING VERY SLOW AND THERE IS NO WAY TO MOVE IT FASTER - EVEN ON HIGHEST SPEED IT EVERYTHING MOVES LIKE TURTLE. Level desing is also rather poor and graphics aren't 'fantastic', like Steam store page is saying. I don't mind that i's iOS/Android port, there are game which can be also good. Too bad there are almost no devs which would care about making it more enjoyable on PC. I had trouble enjoying it thought first campaing. The rest was just a hell which has finally ended...
4860	1	a	For a game that was only made by 2 people, this does suprisingly well for an indie game. The randomly generated galaxies, vast number of missions, and the arcade style combat make for something that is rather retro, but awesome at the same time, because it combines space with zombies! Whats not to love?
290	1	a	Great combination of action and tower defense.
3782	1	a	A bit of a memory &amp; CPU hog, but one of the greats of the TW series.
5245	1	a	Great game, tonnes of depth, zombies, huge battles, zombies, Did I mention it has zombies, SPACE ZOMBIES?! Worth a laugh if you can pick it up for a few quid, expansion is something that you can take or leave. Have Fun!
1935	1	a	This is an amazing strategy game. Even though it was released in 2009 i still enjoy it now. the mix between real time and turn based strategy is realy awesome!!!! you take control of one of a variety of differnt empires and attempt to make your mark in history on a stunning in depth map. there is a lot of things you can do while managing your empire which make i really interesting and you feel like you are actualy the leader of a great nation. THIS IS A MUST BUY!!!
3794	1	a	put empire at war, sid mires civilzation and you get this. I may be a noob and lose every combat but this is encrebly FUNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN. You get to charge and get massivly killed. this was not a wast of my money.
4177	1	a	i play total war in every games invold and i must say BEST GAMES EVER AND FUTURE GAMES EATHER 
4818	1	a	The goal of the two guys that made this game was to bring back a classic type of game that hasn't been seen in a while. They succeeded, and I'm glad they did. It's like Cosmic Rift with elements of Homeworld and EVE Online. It's surprising challenging and fun and it's worth buying just to help support the guys that made it.
2087	1	a	Very nice game, good graphics though a bit old by today's standards. The gameplay is rather well-balanced and it's very enjoyable. Some nasty bugs nonetheless which lower global game experience. Very valuable at a low price (only) now.
1000	1	a	OMD1 and OMD2 are great games!   Generally i don't like 3rd person games but have for this series to be a ton of fun.  OMD2 is better of cause with more options, traps and maps.  Good replayablity as i keep coming back for weekly bashes and always keen to try differant trap combos.   Can't think of and negitives, but a first person view would be a nice touch. maybe something for OMD3 Ha!  Highly recomend! 
503	1	a	I normally hate tower defense games but this one is amazing!
600	1	a	The most fun game about genocide ever made.
4054	1	a	One of the best total wars
1381	1	a	This game right here, is probably one of my favorite Total Wars out there. From fighting in the Americas to the coasts of India this game is never ending action! The battles are amazing even though some people say Napoleon Total War is better, I will say that THIS game is 10x better just because of the sheer grasp of the amount of land there is to explore! From Europe, down into Ottoman controlled Middle East, to India, and finally the Americas. Packed with lots of different factions there is always the ability to be at war or be at peace depending on the type of country you choose to be. The unlimited amount of gameplay is amazing adding hours upon hours of time to spend on this game! 
1904	1	a	* Played it for hours * Found Darthmod * Played it for hours  Best game ever, 11/10
397	1	a	You dont always find a mix gendered tower defense so well done.
3123	1	a	This is an amazing game, especially for tacticians and people who love historic warfare like me. I would definately reccomend this game, Sega and Creative Studios really hit this one out of the park.
2619	1	a	good game but the campagin is good but u get not alot of money
2615	1	a	
204	1	a	Though there barely ain't any, the plot is quite ok and VERY FUNNY. Stuff you can use without DLC is ok, but with DLC it's just amazing. Main Char is nice.   Get it with the DLC and it will be epic awesome despite the lack of co-op or any kind of multiplayer mode.   P.S. So much fun making catapults combos.
2459	1	a	:)
2899	1	a	Great game 10/10
4410	1	a	10/10 would make America great again
1266	0	a	I get it, small, compact, limitless, indie. But it doesn't make it fun or especially intereseting I'm afraid.
3852	1	a	First Total War game, bought it in 2010 and still occasionally play it. It is a lot of fun when you first get it, but you will learn about the bugs a little bit on through the game, especially in sieges. Despite the bugs, once you learn how to avoid them, the game is very fun and you will enjoy it a lot. Here's what I think about it:  Pros: -Being a Total War game you actually fight the battles unlike most strategy games, which I find a lot of fun! -Very Large Map=Lots to Conquer -Not very complicated to learn -3 different regions to conquer: America, India, and Europe -Campaign for the United States is pretty fun -Lots of mods to play with (I like Darth Mod and would recommend it)! -Different troops for different nations -Good Selection of nations  Cons: -Sieges are a little bit buggy, especially with defending and moving groups of units you put together -Campaign a little buggy, after the 200th turn chances of corrupt data increases a lot (lost a United States save with my nation spread all the way to Russia, 150+ hours on that save). -Emptyness in the Western United States (there may not of been cities there at the time, but the cities that are there should include all the land there, it looks very bare without it, especially on the map)  Should I buy it? Yes, just learn to deal with the few bugs, and during a very long campaign with around 200+ turns start having more than one save in case one of them becomes corrupt.
3313	1	a	good game keeps your mind ticking 10/10
177	1	a	I iz an Orc and I fink dis game is inkredibly rood.
2213	1	a	Great game smells normal, and very much like to killz the french... no homo... my name is No, my sign is no, my number is no... Men &lt;3 no homo... â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.
3114	1	a	it is fun for a little bit. the turn sytem is still broken. takes forever. and puckle guns cheat. it is a minature â¥â¥â¥â¥ing gatling gun. it is overall pretty good thouigh
3756	1	a	Played as France, took over England, Ireland, and Scotland, and America rises and asks me to recognize them as an independant nation. I love this game!   BUY IT FOR DARTH MOD!!!!
388	1	a	I got this on a whim a few weeks back. It's one of the best tower defense games that I have ever played, hands down. Great voice acting. Humorous story. Tight controls. Excellent gameplay. A worthy addition to any steam library.
5320	1	a	You can go through one whole hour of combat, with bullets blazing, without managing to spot a single enemy nor shoot a single shot. Hands down the best combat simulator there is.
2328	1	a	Alot of fun but a tad easy. I wish there was more in depth economic settings. soldiers respond a little slow to orders so make plans ahead of time
4704	1	a	It is what it says in the title. â¥â¥â¥â¥in'... come on, were you expecting mermaids?
2214	1	a	This game is worth getting. This game is notorious for it's very buggy release. It's been patched a lot, most of the bugs are gone and the game is worth playing.
1367	1	a	One of the most flawed Total Wars but also one of the largest most ambitious ones. A new engine, full of bugs, a crippled new AI system and a poorly explained game. Time has fixed those issues and it's now the best running large scale Total War. To enjoy it you only really need to accept guns in your Total War. You can always fix your bayonets but never leave your guns at home.  Fight and conquer across three theaters of war, the America's, Europe and Indian sub continent. Play with all the larger colonial powers, the (former) colonies and the warring Indian factions. Re-establish the Ottoman Empire or do make some oversea colonies for Prussia that it never had.  It's a bit aged, lacks the fancy features you will find in Rome 2 and the AI still has some glitches but a lot can be modded out and overal it's way better then Rome 2, larger scale then Napoleon and more diverse then Shogun 2.
4917	1	a	I've played all 3 Escape Velocity games, if that is what these guys were trying to emulate they failed.  This game is overly complicated from the beginning, it has a difficulty curve like a mountain and has combat that simply doesn't have a good feel to it, which is important as there isn't much more to this game. There is a plot, some narration, but honestly the level of the dialouge and the amateur art designs for the charcacters caused me to ignore it after about 10 minutes.  This is Diablo in space, you manuever around, try to damage opponents and mostly are just trying to click at the right times to line up shots against VERY agile opponents. You also constantly have to keep track of how allies are doing, your ship is usually worse then your competitions and there are more of them then there are of your fleet (as opposed to most ARPGs where you have an advantage but you are facing a horde).   It is very easy to die but that's ok, because using your mined resources you can then use them to respawn yourself and your fleet. But you can and will run out of resources, therefore making you not be able to respawn, at which point the game tells you to go get in a very very very crappy ship and start mining, but anyone with common sense will tell you to reload your save instead to save you the mindless grinding that would entail.  This is grossly dissapointing because I feel there is a lot to this game, it generates a new galaxy for every game which would seem to have a huge amount of content but I couldn't get past the second star system and had great difficulty getting past the first (which was the tutorial). Maybe this game was made for the nintendo hard crowd, or maybe I just suck, but I just don't have the time or patience anymore to deal with that. Although after looking at the universal badge progress on this game, I can tell I'm not alone.  Don't trust the metacritic score, although I will say there is something here but you have to be pretty dedicated/skilled to find it.
3434	1	a	Ive logged more hours in this Total War game than any other. It looks great and plays great and is overall super fun.
1071	1	a	If you're after a fun casual challenging but not serious game this is for you! Writing this review I'm only 3hrs into it and love it I definitely recommend this game purely just off how fun it is.   8/10
3643	1	a	Good graphic, good game, but it still lacks for me from the classics like Medieval or Rome. I still love the franchise and its releases.
3138	1	a	Despite the Bugs this game has Epic scope
308	1	a	If you have the money buy the game its amazing. Lots of games time trying to get a 5  skull rating on evrey level. If not at least try the demo for it.
778	1	a	Decent Game. The second one is better in my opinion.
1817	1	a	Great total war game, always find myself coming back to it. Was a mess when first released but with the patches and some good mods this game can be excellent. Definitely recommend.
3129	1	a	Not the best Total War game, but a must for fans of the genre/series. A different take on global conquest than usual.
387	1	a	Very easy to get into. EXTREAMLY FUN! As casual games go there few that can offer you this much fun. Killing the hordes of orcs and vile creatures that storm your castles never gets old. The maps gets very interesting as you move truought the campaign and your unlocked traps and upgrades are persistent so you can use them all the time anywhere.  ORCS MUST DIE  MUST BUY!
4632	1	a	So, I've got lots of very expensive big budget games in my little library. This little indie game is much better, and played far more often then many of them.   It puts you in command of a little squad of ships, one of which you control directly. You hop around from system to system doing jobs for factions and trying to upgrade you ships.   The ships are very configurable, and there are quite a few of them to play around with.   All of this is very addictive. I've blinked and realised a couple of hours have flown by while I've been hopping accross the galaxy looking for that next level reactor part, or missle launcher, or new hull.   The size of the galaxy is configured at the start of the game, and a huge galaxy is really huge. Looking back at that statement, it sounds funny, but it's true :).   If you find the whole zombie craze very tired (like myself), don't be put off by the fact that it's in the title of this game. The zombies aren't really a 'more brains' kind of thing, but more like the reavers in the movie Serenity.  I've gotten a lot of value out of this game. I really don't think you can go wrong if you decide to pick it up.   Oh, and they're working on spaz 2 right now. Yay :). 
2757	1	a	France Surrendered. 10/10 Would Realism Again.
3595	1	a	this is a fun game and there is some fun skrimerish you can do
5129	1	a	Just got this game over the xmas sale. I've really impressed with it! Great fun, a bit of a challenge, and it'll offer hours of good fun.
414	1	a	I'm a little surprised about liking this game. Usually I'm not big on action type games, but I found myself enjoying the mix of action and strategy. Placing the traps correctly is a major part of the game, but wading into a bunch of orcs breaking thru your defenses is the icing on the cake.  I'm not far into the game yet and have found the dificulty to be hit or misss on the levels. Some seem really hard, but the next level is very easy. I can see myself finishing the game as long as the last few levels don't go over the top in difficulty.  Overall a game worth playing, especially if you catch it on sale.
3549	1	a	Empire: Total War is a really fun strategy game. The AI generally sucks, but that is to be expected of a Total War game. Overall 8/10.
4095	1	a	* Plays as the mighty Great Britain*  * United States forms in 1710*  * France gets completely taken over by the United Provinces by 1755* * Russia sells me what is now Ukraine*  * I take over all of North America *  * United States takes over Nassau in the Caribbean*  10/10 most historically accurate game
4645	1	a	Another instant classic. Perfect mix of arcade, strategy and tactics.
2100	0	a	So I personally never plan to buy another total war game since due to my large monitor I can't read any information on the screen and the company doesn't offer any support on this. So I basicaly got screwed out of my money buying these games.
3990	1	a	one of the best strategy game ever !!!!
2012	0	a	Game was super fun until it BROKE during campaign story part three! Dx
4849	1	a	Its a fairly solid game and a lot easier to get into then I first thought it would be. Building up your small fleet and customizing the parts on your ship is pretty fun, but after a while it does become a bit tedious. But for what it is, its a good game worth trying out and I look forward to what the developers brings in the future with this title under their belt.
2909	0	a	I really like the game but it crashes alot such as when you trasnfer troops between ships, or you go to type the amount for payment. It is really irritating when you have to redo turns over and over and over again because you didn't save yor game after every turn, one example of this is at turn 23 my game crashed and now it crashed no matter what i try and i now regret buying hte game because i have no other previous saves because the auto save was what i relied on becuase it always workewd in the past. Also, it has serious lag on the world/ continent maps, i get bettter fps in battle than with the world map, ill get on avergae 80fps on a normal battle and 17 when on the world map.  All in all dont buy the game unless you want a lot of irritation, i wish i had saved my money for a differn't game.
4120	1	a	Play as Sweden during the build up to the great nordic war as Carolus Rex  Fight of and conquer Russia, Denmark and Poland-Lithuania  Rule all of Scandinavia in the great Swedish empire after Truce, and the conquest of all Russia   Conquer Prussia and finish off the Poland-Lithuanian dogs once and for all  End up with an Empire stretching from the North east of the map, to Iceland, and all of Germany, Scandinavia, and parts of Northern Italy  Crush Venice, ally with the Spanish  Somehow neglect that public order back in Stockholm (which was perfect one turn ago) has now deteriorated  March Carolus Rex and the Grand Swedish army back to the homeland to quell any silly notions of revolution  Don't make it back in time, oh well, the rebels only have a small army, I will crush them next turn  Cross the border and cry as two thirds of your army join the rebels, who then take the captial a turn later, ending the Swedish Empire  10/10 would neglect the homeland once more
1791	1	a	Conquered the USA, then got defeated from some territories by some natives with axes...  10/10, would lose to a primitive force after destroying a future super power again.
2985	1	a	One of the best games ever made in the total war genre!
1874	1	a	This game has by far the best economic system of the Total War series, and you know why? NO DAMN SQUALOR! Unlike the Rome games, it meshes your military and civil fronts together as simply as possible. Not enough money, fire some soldiers! Town looks like it's about to rebel and shove a bayonet up your â¥â¥â¥â¥? Fill it with troops! I'm no historian, but the battles seem to get the basics right. Running 3 miles in full combat gear's gonna tucker you out, Swordsmen are better at giving close range 'hugs' than snipers, and farmers are gonna panic when Terry next door is turned into a shrapnel pincushion. Trust me. I'm a the Broiest of all generals.
631	1	a	A very fun and satisfying tower defense / shooter type game. You have an array of traps and some basic spells to choose from to slice, burn, crush, and explode the Orcs from entering the Rift. Sounds are excellent to make you feel like you are actually doing damage and the visuals aren't the best but still pretty awesome. Tons of voice acting to keep you smiling. There are plenty of Tower Defense / Shooter types out there, but this is the most satisfying one yet.
332	1	a	Good stuff, well worth the money and a lot of fun. A new spin on tower defense.
4964	1	a	An excellent top down space based game, it's a pretty unique experience with some rpg like progression elements. Definitely worth playing.
2442	1	a	If you want to rule the world then this is the game for you, when it released there was so much wrong with it however patches were released and as of now I still think Empire is the best Total War game to date !!
4746	1	a	RTS? Yeah I suck at this.
5204	1	a	Easy to learn, hard to master. Lengthy campaign that is allot of fun. The programmer's kept it simple, and knew how to manage their efforts well.
4719	1	a	Pretty fun game. 8.5 out of 10
2160	1	a	this game is amazing the naval battles are what got me but the rest is just as impressive. DarthMOD is a must for sure adds better musket sounds better smoke, ai tweaks, more units ect ect.
2508	1	a	This game is perfect in every aspect. From the mechanics, to the campaign map and to the stunning battlefields, everything will just blow you away. That's what it's been doing for 5 years now.
4667	1	a	Might not have actually played this game too much but the concept is worth buying by itself. I mean come on. PIRATES IN SPACE WITH ZOMBIES. Imagine Pirates of the Carribean combined with Shaun of the Dead but there is no gravity and it's set in every Sci-Fi universe ever. Think i've said enough.  10/10 would collect minerals again.
2981	1	a	ITs not new but fun, better then rome 2, where did they go wrong?
1247	1	a	An ok TD for a ok price. Bog standard TD where enemies go on a set path (no mazing) and just build/upgrade towers. Decent amount of missions and can be quite challenging.
1107	1	a	If you don't like this game, you do not like having fun. Get it, it's worth every penny. The DLC is pretty good too.
5157	1	a	Robotron: 2084 (1982) Smash TV (1990) Llamatron (1991) Total Carnage (1992) Operation: Inner Space (1994) Geometry Wars (2003) Starscape (2008) Spore, specifically the space stage (2008)  If you liked any of the above, try this out. It most closely resembles Operation: Inner Space and Starscape. Try the PC demo, it's free.
4954	1	a	All the fun of a top-down space shooter and RPG. Very reminiscent of Star Control II in many ways. Fun strategy and great battle and upgrade options. Story is OK - but like many RPG's, can get a little repetetive and straightforward.
648	1	a	I saw a friend of mine playing a game like this a long time ago on PS1, I never got to try it myself, forgot what it was called, but ever since then Ive been wanting a game where you could spawn all sorts of gorey traps on the walls of a castle and then let the invaders run through them. This game gives me all that, and more, more as in comedy, badassery, archery, when in doubt use fire. This is the first recommendation I've ever done, so I hope that tells you something, it's just a game for pure fun and slaughter of evil orcs.
4599	1	a	Great game!. And It's an Indie title so you know the two (yes two) people who worked on it really gave a full effort. And it shows. I totally reccamend purchasing this game.
2359	0	a	why in the helll this game is not working on windows 7 ......what i must do to resolve the issue...pls
2431	1	a	It's a excelent strategy game, you'll have three huge maps to explorer. An extense campaign and content into the game. Worth check it.
2443	1	a	
1502	1	a	I was playing as Sweden first the russian declared war on me, I beat them after about 20 turns or more now my empire is HUGE. So after I beat the russian i took a fleat of ships, loaded them all with line infantry and canons, went to north america attacked the 13 colonies took all there land but also now my british are at war with me so I saild a few ships and army there took them all out, they offer me a peace treaty so I accepted it. Now my empire is really strong I feel unbeatable so I started a campaign on the ottomans lost half of my men against farmers with pitch forks (I had line infantry), finally i took one of the citys of the ottomans. But it was not long untill 3 armys attack my new conquered city, they all have elephants with poeple riding on them with guns so now I lost the battle so my city was recaptured my the ottomans. Now its my turn so I send my men down south to attak the ottomans I attack some of there armys and farms, I could not move my men down any more so i end the turn, all of a sudden the austrian declared war on me, so now I need to attack from 2 fronts. After about 10 turns ottomens and austrian took all of my captured rusian citys, they pushed my back all the way to the motherland, now im â¥â¥â¥â¥ed I half of my army is at north america fighting, so what i did was I loaded all of my men into ships and saild back the sweden it took me a few turns but good thing my men manage to hold the invaders back. So now my whole army is at the motherland, first I tried to make a peace treaty with them but the dident accept so I sent my men to attack but lost to the ottomens now im really â¥â¥â¥â¥ed (at the mean time i lost all my Citys to the natives) so I loaded my last few ships and men and sailed for india I got there after a few turns i attack the united provinces small island in india won the battle also at the same time my main city in sweden was captured by the ottomens good thing i won the battle with the united provinces or it would have kicked my out of the game. So now I have to go eat (Dinner) i was about to save my game then it crashed took me 4 days to play saved only 3 times lost some of my progress but it was still fun to make history and kill hundred of civlian and soilders. 10/10 would play agian
1450	1	a	More complex than other games in this series, harder to learn but one of the best in the Total War franchise
232	1	a	With a title like that how is one supposed to refuse? Ok it's actually rather fun. For the seasoned tower defense expert it's a rather fun 3D variation. Tower Defense for the uninitiated is at it's best a grid based puzzler. Choose how and where to defend utilising resources you earn. The more experianced you become, the more traps and defenses you can place. It's biggest failing is that there is no autofire. Constantly having to slam the mouse button to fire an arrow or whack a sword becomes a little tiring. Would I reccommend it? Yes I would on a steam sale, simply for the fun sounds and indie humour, dotted around endearing orcy goodness. A quick level now and again, is what makes a solid indie hit. Without the 'just one more go' deliciousnous of games like this, we'd forget the simple pleasure of gaming.
2104	1	a	Amazing... dated now but was amazing! 9/10.
4139	1	a	This game is super awesome! I have always been fascinated with the warfare of the era and the UNIFORMS ARE SO SEXY!!!!! Everything about this game is amazing! People say this game have many bugs and probems but i havent seen themor i have and just didnt care, if it doesnt ruin the gameplay, im ok with it. 1000000/10 Its Amazing!
695	1	a	This is a fun two player experience and is rather unique in its approach. I'd call this a good game if you are not expecting more than it has to offer. It is good at what it does offer.
3684	1	a	40,000 English VS 100 French....french won 10/10
4003	1	a	I bought this game quite awhile back, it isnt as well polished as Mediveal 2 total war or Shogun 2 total war but its polished enough to be enjoyable to anyone who wishes to create large colonial empires based around using lots of fancily dressed men shooting at each other  this is the first total war game to feature rts ship battles, they arent as good as in SHogun but they are very fun, as long as it doesnt freeze up and crash youll be fine  to really get the most fun out of this game try out the Darth Mod with it, it really opens the game up
2566	1	a	I really love this game. Lots of reply-value and fun times all around.
2131	1	a	Still playing it 8 years after release. Last game I got hooked on in the series.
446	1	a	good if you want a timekiller
2996	1	a	This is the best game ever best total war ever! I totally recommend it if you are looking for a strategy game to play with a friend the DLC units help alot but are not required to play I win with just militia sometimes. YES IT IS AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! GET IT IF YOUR AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4895	1	a	Great game, Highly Addicting.  Old fashioned 2D arcade feel with a brilliant and humourous storyline.  Also... zombies.
1670	1	a	if you enjoy history around 1700-1800 get this game. Sweden and ottoman empire is a little OP in multi-player but you can find a weakness in every faction. Poland is a cool faction to play with in the grand campaign and of course Britain and France have the most to do. England is the best to play with on the hardest difficulty because you have to fight on 3 fronts.
2591	1	a	Evrything's incredible except for when moving units into and out of buildings, also with sieging forts, that's all very buggy but everything is is fantastic.
3319	1	a	Naval Battles are really hard but it's a solid game and i give it a 8/10
4887	1	a	Crazy addictive. Once of the best indie games I've played.
937	1	a	An enjoyable strategy/action game of a single war mage against an orc army. Quite short, but I enjoyed the challenges and uniqueness that came with it.
1894	1	a	This game is fantastic. The good things about it is the lardge scale battles, world map, the large amount of difrent units and  countries to shose from and of course the stratagy. You have to think in this game. The bad things about it is that it takes alot of memory and disk space so i reckomend to have a good PC. I have had multipel crashes in this game and corupted saves.  In all i recomend this game.
4384	1	a	This is still one of my favorite total war games of all time. Total war with guns, what is not to like? 4 stars * It lost a star due to it being a bug ridden mess.
3964	1	a	MOST ADDICTING GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED.
3518	1	a	A great game. You can play for hours on end and get lost in the gameplay.
2466	1	a	The only Total War game in which to really conquer the world!
185	1	a	Hands up who wants to die!
1407	1	a	This is one of the best games I have ever played and if you dont like it thats ok but befor deleting the game try putting on Minor Factions revenge or Darth mod.
2547	1	a	Very good game and entertaining. But they need to fix the bugs
4861	1	a	A Space Opera where politics involve: bribing, shooting first without asking questions, and shoving the occasional insubordinate crew member out the air lock. Suck it---Space.
2761	1	a	BEST STRATGY GAME EVER (in the total war series. do i have to say anything else... Actually yes there is something lacking in this game and that is there is no 'victory points' like the ones used in hearts of iron so you can take over %99 of a countrys territory and you could possibly not win it automatically which is not a huge problem so it doesn't really matter.  Anyway 9/10
1028	1	a	Great fun and easily worth 14â¬ . Easy to play and just the right amount of challenge.
3509	1	a	Of all Total War titles, this one is my favorite, campaign wise at least. Granted there are plenty of bugs and the AI is â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ but I love having such a vast area of the world to fight over. It's a bit like an open world RTS if that makes any sense. You can start an empire anywhere, from America all the way to India that can expand across continents.  I loved sweeping down from the north with the armies of Russia in America, creating a staging area to invade the colonies of the other empires. Cutting right through the natives, slaughtering their armies with cannon and shot. My empire became just that, my empire, not limited by boundaries typical of games similar to this typically empose.  My expansion unlimited, my armies mighty, an entire world just a few short turns away from domination. It's glorious.
196	1	a	Great physics game that gets progressively harder in single player tower defense action. Weilding your crossbow, you fight a army of orcs attempting to survive them and find out what is happening. Owning this game and the second gives you classic levels in the first one as well. Recommend if you get the second orcs must die for the complete story and extra levels with friends.
469	1	a	Fun game. can't say much for replay value as I didn't try to play it again ever. still worth one play through.
1995	1	a	This game is very good.
1991	1	a	No mods,wishing more melee units for british,french,spanish,prussia,austria,ect...Diplomatic structure is overall good,but not as good as rome 2's.I would suggest this game to anyone looking for a good colonial game.However,do keep in mind the FEW flaws in the game.
3113	1	a	Â£20.00? I didnt know they stacked â¥â¥â¥â¥ that high. All kidding aside though, empire total war is a great departure from the hack-n'-slash swords and sandals action of all previous installments, with a new (hindering) engine (that would draw the series back for its next installments) and guns all over the place. the mechanics work well, but its buggy, has a very poorly designed and unoptimised UI (with unit cards being tiny in MP, and the campaign UI being so shrunken and off mods are a MUST) overall, its a choppy attempt at colonial warfare. Is it fun? Hells yea, but Im a die hard total war fan- and the UI is genuinley unbearable. To the point where I will stop playing halfway through a turn. For a first installment in the 'new' total war franchise, its not a ragged abortion like Rome 2, but not a work of strategic art, like most of the first series, especially Medieval 2 and Rome TW. Also, naval warfare... personally I think they did it as best they could, but its complicated, hard to master and REALLY annoying at times. Its nice due to demand after the other games, but leaving it out would have saved shogun 2 and Rome 2's naval battles some credibility. AI is worse than the other games in my opinion, only trumped in Rome 2 for its flaws- and that is saying something. Overall, its a shoddy mess of a creative assembley idea- but it gave way to Napoleon and Shogun 2, the latter of which is top 3 in the series. So if you want an opener into the new engine before exploring the vastly superior titles later on down the line- empire is your jam. But if guns aren't your thing, then the butter is in Shogun 2 , Medieval 2 and Rome TW.  Oh, and dont give the modern neo-capitalist devs the bread which is DLC, because if the run button becomes dowloadable content in the next one then you might as well have this game to play instead :) I reccoment empire total war, it may be the sad, discarded love-child of the franchise, but we love it anyway :D
2013	0	a	It was fun at first but then it just became the same thing over and over again and naval battles are boring and slow and I can't do a beach assult on an harbour because now you have to land your troops somewere else to walk around and then assult the harbour from land but what I wanna do is to see the smoke from the towns and harbours as they are getting bombarded from the cannons on the ships to later send your men out in smaller boats to shore.  How it is know I wouldn't recomend this game
4281	1	a	Got to say this really is all that is cracked up to be and more!!! ! I really enjoy Empire Total War it really is an amazing game. The only draw back is you cant just create spies, priest, or assassin's the rake and gentlemen when you want. The naval battles are really cool and glad they put that in the game. The differences in the trade economy is pretty cool. The shipping lanes to the other countries is very interesting. Piracy taking other peoples profit is an added bonus.
1861	1	a	GREAT game! Campaigns are perfect as is the free world 'Grand Campaign'.... Multiplayer is a bit unbalanced and buggy but all up a great game from the best in the bizz, the Total War gang! 4/5
1716	1	a	Ai more â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ than a rock
2960	1	a	This game is woth buying just for the skirmish mode.
2288	0	a	i can run war thunder on hight this game i tried running it on low but nearly everytime it just glitches me out of a game for some reason it doesnt even crash i have good connection and it shows me the main menu without me wanting it to. Its a fun game but the pain i have to deal with its a 1v1 why does it get me back to starter menu and it was all fine too nothing was wrong it just got me out of the game same thing happens in 1v1 when i verse ai also there were a lot less troops on the map it was the end game
5240	1	a	SPAZ is a great space-combat game. I haven't played a space game this fun since Escape Velocity: Nova. If the 2D space genre at all interests you, you need to buy it, now. Fans of this game should also take a look at Drox Operative, which takes a more Diablo-esque stance to space combat, though I find that controls in that game to be less fun.  This game, though fun, lacks a fair amount of depth. it has it's problems, and I shall list some of those out here. Make no mistake, my overall rating for this game would still be an 8/10.  First of all, alt+tabbing is a bit of a pain. You need an active window to tab into otherwise it won't work. The intro movies, though short, are not skippable. Skipping the tutorial leaves you at a bit of a disadvantage level wise. I cannot figure out enemy aggro. Sometimes, they choose to target exclusively my own ships despite other enemy ships attacking them. On a mission to kill enemy scouts, if the scouts are friendly, it is impossible because my own ships will not target them. I cannot select enemy ships to be targeted from the tactical menu. Targeting specific enemy ships can be a pain sometimes and this would help immensely. Enemy ships will often only attack my escorts. And my escorts will fly way off to attack enemy ships. This has led to all my rez being depleted while I just sit there and do nothing. More AI options are needed. Even defensive AI is way too aggressive. An AI option where friendly ships never leave the screen would be nice. Better yet, formations would be a welcome addition to the game. Even just one basic formation would be extremely helpful in keeping my fleet in line. Friendly AI ships get â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ off way too easily. There aren't enough missions to weaken the enemy faction in a given system. This forces me to either attack a level 3 space station, or make peace with the enemy at the expense of my ally.  As a final sidenote, I love the radio chatter that goes on. You should allow people to upload their own chatter for inclusion into the game somehow.
3893	1	a	Accurate world domination simulator.
3079	1	a	Great game, great for all you stratagy gamers!
2957	0	a	Really feels like there's a amazing game hiding behind those unfixed bugs, terrible fighting mechanics and the campaign map. I won't write any long details, so here is my review.   PROS: -a game based in the timeline no other TW game is (it's always good to have this specialty) -music? (neutral) -attractive DLC's? -attractive in-game models? -being able to fight in the line of battle  CONS: -terrible AI -unfixed bugs -terrible fighting mechanics -regions (occupying 2 regions from france in europe will remove their entire mainland from europe)
904	1	a	Great Tower defense/strategy game, Great fun killing many orcs!
1657	1	a	Played vanilla for about 200 hours, came to the conclusion it was pretty sh*te, then decided to download Darthmod and it was suddenly the best game ever!   Starting a new campaign always feels new and refreshing, never gets boring.  MP is a no-go area, mostly deserted, if you happen to find someone it's usually rocket ship spam or something similar.  10/10 though!    And yes, I'm still upset about Rome 2..
1752	1	a	If you are a fan of RTS games, you owe it to yourself to check this title out. Definitely worth the price!
4547	1	a	This game has taken many hours from me unlike any other game thus far. Think of this game as a... top down... twin stick shooter... version of EVE Online. It's almost the exact same thing at it's base, you fly around, shooting stuff, mining stuff and building your fleet. Mind you it's single player only it's a great game. With voice acting by TotalBiscuit it's an amazing price. You owe it to your self to buy this game and play the living snot out of it! Buy it... now!
2922	1	a	This Game Awwwesome ! I Should Add to Game: -Change the state of the polity.Example:Monarchy to Republic. -You made a quick throw balls and guns. Yes Yes Yes :) But;collection to expensive ;( Please have become cheaper Thanks For GAME :)
3263	1	a	If you like the Civ Collection then you should be into this game. Has the same feel, direction, play stlyle, etc. Added twist is you can actually control the troops in the battle. definitely worth a play!
1866	1	a	Roma Victor!  Oh wait... It's 1700!   Rule Britannia!!!  
4626	1	a	A solid game and a good time Sync. Cant wait for SPAZ 2
1965	1	a	With help of a mod, I was able to transform Scotland into a world trading superpower. What is not to love?
3031	1	a	The only things that I dislike about this game is that the diplomacy can be ridiculous sometimes and siege battles feel clunky/buggy/crappy in general. Diplomatic threats don't really seem to do anything, even if you have conquered all but one of an enemy faction's regions in a blitzkrieg-like fashion. The AI in battle will sometimes make you do a Picard double-facepalm, but that hasn't happened too often for me.   Controls were alright. You can play as minor nations but you'll need darthmod to do that. Otherwise, I've liked the game a lot. Hoping to get Shogun 2 soon. I haven't played multiplayer yet, and I've had a fair amount of hours just from the single player Grand Campaign (along with the Road to Independence campaign).
3172	1	a	My personal favorite of the Total War games, very good gameplay and the nval battle are great if you know what your doing. 8/10
4455	1	a	Great game! I hope microsoft is now developing AoE 4 !
1681	1	a	10/10 Would play forever
1658	1	a	Good as balls.
84	1	a	Looks childish, but it is amazingly fun! Hours of gameplay and quite addicting! And it's not like one of those games where once you have good stuff everything is easy, the levels get super challenging. The downloadable content (DLC) is incredible, it makes the game 10 times better. I definately suggest buying this game AND the DLCs. Awesome game, and I highly recommend it!
939	1	a	Not to be confused with 'Goblins Must Die' ' Kobolds Must Die' 'Bugbears Must Die' and 'All Dire-Celestial-Vampiric Chairs Must Be Dismantled' Orcs Must Die is a game where I'm awesome. Yes, I am awesome, thank you for asking. The orcs come at me and they must die because I'm awesome. I also don't want to massage corn so there's that too.  I have spinny-whirly dealies and spikey things and make things go BOOM! to make orcs go deader. Because orcs being alive are not being dead enough. They don't like it when you slice and dice them and shoot them and burn them and crush them and fling them and feed them to ogres and get other people to shoot them or slice them. I suggest lightly steamed with a dip of tar as a good option, or maybe filled with bolts. It's really up to you, who is me in this case, and awesome.
4552	1	a	Space, Pirates, And Zombies. Well you pretty much get what the title says*. This game was pretty fun, the exploration, the mining, the combat, the zombies*, and everything else made this game into something that can be truely enjoyed. I would reccomend this to anyone. It is really facinating, exploring all of the stars, planets, etc. And it is something you should buy.              *Pirates not included**.  **Unless you are a pirate. 
3712	1	a	Awesome game that i have sunk 100 plus hrs into. I highly recommend it
2137	1	a	love this game
2281	0	a	The game is okay but units acted stupid and other countries lets just say shoot first and care later. But there are other games what are going to be better than this.
514	1	a	The RPG!
5004	1	a	There are some games that are like reading great book on roller caster with jet fighting around you and explosions beneath you, games that after you finish them you just have one thought: WOW!  SPAZ is not one of these games. Spaz is like couch, good TV, beer and some relaxing film. There is nothing new, nothing special, very often same situation over and over and still when you are at work you think about that couch. When you sit at this couch and your friends calling you just don't want to leave.   SPAZ is great space shooter/aka RTS/tactic/brainless forward, backward, shoot that as****e, re-spawn, forward, backward... With few types of missions and some plot. Nothing special really. But SPAZ does have this one thing that a lot of games miss, that weird, invisible thing that makes you want to play this game again, and again, and again. And when you have enough, you just leave it there to find out that week later you want to play it again.   Is it worth 10 euros? Hmm, knowing what I know now, it's rather yes. Is it worth 5 euros? Hell yeah! So it's your choice my friend, will you sit on the couch and start a next good, lazy day?
4522	1	a	Highly recommended.  This is easily one of the best games I have played in years.  Althought it does not have the fancy 3D near human modern graphics that most 'players' want in today's games, I find it far more preferable to those.  The game plays exactly as advertised, like the old Star Control games. You are a small band trying to find the magic pot of gold at the center of the universe and travel along the universe, up to 300 systems, fighting and exploring and building up your fleet.  The beauty of this game is there is no right or wrong way to play it.   You jump into a system and if you feel like fighting you can or you can dock at a station and bribe the guards. You can fight one side in a map then jump into the next one and be that sides friends. Or you can fight both sides if you feel like it. There is enough variety in the ship classes and equipment to keep it interesting for many games yet to come. Also, the maps are randomly generated each time so no 2 games will ever play the same. What makes this game truly awesome is it was made by 2 people who loved the product and were not out to make a quick buck at the players expense. I can not wait for SPAZ2 to come out later.  I hope I will be the first one to buy that one.!!!!
292	1	a	It's a fast paced Dungeon Defenders with a little Sanctum mixed in. Reminds me of Dungeon Keepers (a really old game) where you get to make your own dungeons and set up traps. This has that same feel to it as you're essentially laying traps (some straight forward, others are interesting) and shooting/attacking the baddies before they make it to the end of the level. It's actually quite fun and I'd highly suggest to buy it even if you've already played DD and/or Sanctum a bunch. =3
1098	1	a	no one get this game
4659	1	a	Best game ever! Couldn't stop playing... And the price is so low. Totally worth it!
3764	1	a	Great game, but there is one major problem - insanely long load times. At first, I thought it might be my computer (it wasn't), so I lowered the settings but weirdly that made them even longer.  Beyond that, I think it is the last truely great Total War game.
87	1	a	Easy to learn and hard to master. Very fun and flexible to meet a lot of different play styles.
2571	0	a	Not my cup of tea
3320	1	a	Empire: Total War is the first game in the series to allow naval battles to be conducted in real-time. In addition to the standard campaign mode, the game includes a special campaign that follows the development of the United States from the settlement of Jamestown to the American War of Independence. Players may also engage in recreations of several historical battles from the early modern era.
5012	1	a	Its so fun, dropped many fun hours into it. Hiughly recommend, there should be more of these games.
927	1	a	A fun fast-paced tower defense
57	1	a	â Good graphics and design â Humour â Nice animations â Good game engine and special effect â Overall nice presentation  â No Linux support.
2138	1	a	despite playing numerous campaigns they all end up very different and new experince   however i will say that the ai can be a tad stupid at times (not always) but overall great addition to franchise   only minor grub i have is that you can't conquer africa, austrailia etc... but india and north america are still great additions in the right direction
3550	1	a	another great total war game
269	0	a	Orcs Must Die is one of my least favorite games. I think this would be a great game if it was sort of like Torchlight II. You really need a pet or an ally to help you. This game reminds me of an old game called Lemmings. It was impossible for me to prevent the Orcs from destroying everything. I never could master the gameplay. The demo was fun to play. The rest of the game was a nightmare.
3403	1	a	i like this game verry much i think its one of the best games out there
2314	1	a	A good mixed. If you like Turn-Based or RTS, you'll be satisfied with this game. Extreme amount of depth and great variety between the factions as well as the different terrain elements depending on the region of the world you are fighting. Strongly recommend for the strategy fan.
4957	1	a	Pirate and Zombies in space, need anything else ? Plus Totalbiscuit voice acting. Neat little indy game.
2844	1	a	good game try it
3548	1	a	one of the best strategy games ever! 
4740	1	a	A whole lot of fun
4972	1	a	As you can see i played this game quite a bit. i played the demo before anything too. so when i say this game was just a stepping stone for what is to come in SPAZ 2 the you best belive me. yes this game had its flaws at time i can rember refusing to play because i had put myself in a stupid situation i couldnt do anything in. however im writing this maily becasue im hard for SPAZ 2 and waiting while your eger sucks.  BASICALLY MY MESSAGE IS SPAZ IS AWESOME!!!!  and i have high hopes for SPAZ 2
4859	1	a	On the surface, this may just look like Asteroids 2011. And yes, the 2D space battles are awesome and the control mechanics are good once you're used to them. But it's also part RPG: your ships as your characters, complete with loadouts, unlocks, and even skills via your tech research. And part RTS, via a rudimentary tactical screen where you can control your forces mid-battle. You unlock new ships by destroying someone else's model - even your allies' - and scouring the wreckage; piracy comes naturally in the game. Cuz hey... that's a beautiful new ship your 'valued comrade' just brought to battle. It'd be a shame if anything happened to it...
3599	1	a	awesome strategy game and easily picked up through a couple of hours of playing
5242	1	a	I spent 72 hours in the game so far. It's like 3 days and 3 nights of addictive fun for 10 EUR. Worth it.
3481	1	a	It is Empire Total War on Sale - Need I say more?
3758	1	a	An AMAZING Total War game. Battles are very fun to play through, and there are many excellent campaign features. All around, extremely fun. In 27 hours, I've completed the Road to Independence campaign, and just started a Grand Campaign.
5127	1	a	Tired of too much free time? Destroy it with this awesome game. Don't blame me if you forget to sleep or eat...
117	1	a	Definitely worth buying.
3880	1	a	Great game my fav stratagy series
451	1	a	If you win, you feel good having beaten up derpy orcs. If you lose, you feel good watching the over confident main character die. You can't lose unless you don't buy.
4609	1	a	Oh good Lord, make me a son and I'll name it SPAZ 2!
4159	1	a	yassssssssssssssss one the best strategy games i ever played
5270	1	a	Install a BigBeffmod when you got bored of the chapter four. Don't make a galaxy with more than 150 systems, unless you would like to grind.
608	1	a	The ultimate Tower Defense 3rd person shooter; I would have payed $60 for this game!
991	1	a	A nice tower defence game that makes you scream ORCS MUST DIE!!!!
1909	1	a	fun game, one of the best strategy games i own.
2816	1	a	A lot of people like to say that this game is one of the Total War series failures, however I personally love this game. Yes there are many things that could be improved upon (as is true with most games) but Empire Total War was the game to introduce many new concepts into the series which have been further developed in later games. I recommend this game to any who enjoy strategy games and to all the history buffs out there. Even if you don't choose Empire, I recommend the Total War series as a whole.
5070	1	a	On the surface, this may just look like Asteroids 2011. And yes, the 2D space battles are awesome and the control mechanics are good once you're used to them.

4010	1	a	Amazing game!! There is very little lag. There are a lot of countries in campaign. I highly recemmend this game.
2360	1	a	Great real time strategy game, although it lacks replay value as the combat can get stale.
1404	1	a	It's not the strongest entry in the Total War series, but there's something unsettlingly satisfying about ordering thousands of soldiers to march in formation to the beat of a drum as canon fire rips them to shreds...the ranks are formed, and after a few devastating volleys the bugle sounds and the lines begin to charge, bayonets fixed. The oder of battle is lost, and the carngae of war is revealed, the field running red with blood of men sent die in a faraway land, their last thoughts being of a home they shall never see again. Hope that trade agreement was worth it.
1883	1	a	I bet the brits didnt like the campaign...
4404	1	a	Best total war game 11/9
360	1	a	Recommended, a nice twist on the tower defence genre
4271	1	a	Started as le-majestic Sweden, captured most all of Eastern Europe along with Denmark, Norway, The Netherlands, Poland/Lithuania, Italy, and built up enough naval power to sink the whole isle of Britain itself.  Lost the campaign because I captured the whole of Prussia but was a day late to taking the Capital.
1433	1	a	Like it. Really cool and has a lot of historically accurate stuff.
5054	1	a	Best top-down RPG arcade space shooter around.
4012	0	a	The game is completely unplayable due to blurry, unreadable texts. If you don't have this issue, you're lucky, if you have this, just screw you, there is no solution for you and developers don't want to do anything with this for years. Don't be a looser and don't pay for this piece of crap, until they move they're lazy asses and fix it.
2710	1	a	It keeps me healthy
1373	1	a	I don't know what happened how did this happen 354.7hrs someone help me
2433	0	a	It's been almost 5 â¥â¥â¥â¥ing years and the campaign map still â¥â¥â¥â¥ing stutters! DO NOT BUY.
2365	0	a	Don't bother, buy shogun and its expansion. This game is 'fine' but just that, fine. Nothing more.  -Ai issues, balance issues, battle issues, difficulty issues.... all because the Air it's dumb to say the least.... so, please buy shogun  postscript: Napoleon it's slightly better, but still have issues.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naQaRIaXyAU 
3069	1	a	Classic Game filled with awesome battles
1462	1	a	For those who want to have a massive empire. 
236	1	a	8/10 - Kill a couple of Orcs, then kill more of them and repeat the cycle. Sounds boring? Tell me how it can sounds boring, because it sounds epic.
4970	1	a	Arcade style gameplay that is fun and worth the price of admission. Rating 7.5/10
1852	1	a	Great game... this was my first total war game i ever played and its just so amazing. You can literally do anything and change history with it. The only thing i dont like about it is that the A.I. is not the best as it was.. ;) but with darthmod or ACW mod its awsome even with vanilla. Ive had 390 hours with this game and im very impressed. I even took over the world with malta on hard level. Its just a great game and i would reccomend this game to the world.  9/10  Great game!!
2103	1	a	good so good and that is what she sed
33	1	a	WTF is it? - Orcs Must Die! is a third-person trap laying orc slaying monster delaying tower defense game. It is the second game made by Robot Entertainment whose studio is made up of people from the now defunct Ensemble Studios. Why is that significant? Well at one point in my life I was a console gamer, I won't go into specifics because those were dark times filled with low framerates, but I digress. The game that I played the most on xbox was Halo Wars which was developed by Ensemble. Being the amazing devs they are, they have yet again impressed me with Orcs Must Die! The objective of the game is to stop orcs from reaching the rift(s) on each level by placing traps and using weapons. Each level has multiple waves of orcs that increase in difficulty over the rounds and if enough orcs enter the rift(s) the rift score drops to zero and you lose. The plot of the game is surprisingly interesting aswell since you play as a War Mage who is the last member of an order dedicated to defending the rifts which are sources of magic for the two worlds. I think they could have gone more in depth with the story even though this is a somewhat silly game.  Verdict - Well worth the time and money.  BTW - This is better than that Rift mmo.
4435	1	a	with 745.9 hours of gameplay i can safely say this game is worth every penny  EDIT: I have 4 more hours.
3834	1	a	tis good
4533	1	a	Great game! Proberly the best 2D arcade space shooter ever!   When you unlocked the big capital ships you feel like Capt. Kirk himself in a fight. But not only the action, also the RPG elements (trade, tech-tree, unlocks) are real fun. Try the free demo. But if you like oldschool action, this is a must buy!!!
3828	1	a	Played as The Netherlands, took over France, and made Quebec my puppet. I like my french ice cold. 10/10
4105	1	a	It is AMAZING
437	1	a	A new twist on tower defense games and I feel like it's the best out there. Great diffculity
4628	1	a	Great game. Top down two dimensional view arcade-y space sim-lite. A mouthful!   Side with the UTA (the established military forces) or the civilians of countless star systems while keeping safe from zombies and bounty hunters in your quest to the core of the universe. Power up your ships, find blueprints and build new ones, customize them with a variety of weapons and systems, or maybe just mine asteroids until your eyes bleed. It's your choice, and it's deep enough to be engaging but not so deep as to completely ward off newbies.
3515	1	a	Played this for a while and it's fun. There are some mods for it like Darthmod to make it more challenging due to half bad, half good AI and some diplomatic tweaks. Most changes are consmetic though.   It's fun to play as a great nation from that era and conquer the world, example the Britts vs. French or Swede vs Russians and you can build up empires and change the course of history. The replayability is huge because no campaign is the other alike.   It's worth the full price tag and even more so on sale.
3722	1	a	Empire total war make a good decision of planing game i loved that history of war preiod.
5267	1	a	Great shoot-em'-up title that reminds me of similar PC games of the past. Very cool!
2786	1	a	love the game
2036	1	a	While old, Total war Empire gives a very large selection of territories and factions, with more flexibility than newer games, such as Rome 2, Shogun 2 or Napoleon.
4189	1	a	Favourite game of all TIME!
1902	0	a	The AI for your troops is very bad...
2869	1	a	Very fun game. It took a bit of time to get used to it but it comes easily. The demo is nice becasue is showcases and shows how well the game will run. Be sure to play a little bit of the road to independance and the the tutorial so you can get idea of how to play. 
170	1	a	I have wanted this game for a long time..Thanks steam for a wonderful sale!!! Let the killing begin!
3837	1	a	awesome buy it no matter the price unless you ahve an issue with pure awesomeness the murderign of armies in mass  war tactics strategy patience  politics revolutions  and so forth thsi game is the best
2706	1	a	Yes - but only if very heavily modded.... Great potential, but a shoddy, rushed job -where the rushing really shows... Campaign 5/10, Sea Battles 7/10, Land battles 9/10 when heavily modded......
1975	0	a	How the HELL did this get 92% positive reviews? Buggy as the Amazon, battle engine is so stupid that it hurts, agents aren't recruited manually and if you don't install mods this game is about as good as being burnt alive. And for some â¥â¥â¥â¥ING stupid reason I can't set my graphics higher than medium so it looks incredibly ugly.
3429	1	a	The Total War series is the leading frachise in realistic historical strategy games, making great titles like Rome TW and TW Shogun 2, but the Empire and Napoleon (very similar) have something severely lacking in them.Whether it's the stand-still-and-shoot-the-other-unit- feeling combat or the boring research or taking too long to capture a lot of provinces. Empire feels like it could possibly be one of the worst Total War games, sliding in there with the one I despise, Medieval II.  Empire:Total War - 6.5
4580	1	a	It involves Space, Pirates, AND Zombies! What more reasons could you possibly need? One of my favourite games.
429	1	a	This game is so dam fun it really challanges you too think outside the box and can be a little crazy with weapons
657	1	a	Wicked fun, and honestly AMAZING value for the money. Even if you don't like tower-defense style games, I would recommend giving this a try!
2662	1	a	Best Game I have ever played could play forever.
5230	1	a	I loved it all the way through, can't wait for SPAZ 2!
4063	1	a	This game is well done and very rewarding to win. It can seem rather complex at first. However, it is manageable and once you get a hang of it, Empire: Total War is an vigorating expirience that can provide a nice challenge or can allow you to completely anialate armies, whatever you want. It's your army after all.
1296	1	a	If this game was a potato, it would be a good potato.
3985	1	a	Oh man... The world domination is so fun. I'm still playing it! So far i've almost lost france twice (playing as Great Britain) to revolts until I realized how easy it was to simply excempt it from taxes... Anyway its really and does take some time strategizing your next move. You cant simply declare war on everyone at once. Although this game is old there are several fun mods. I highly recommend anyone who plays total war games or any RTS games in general to buy this game and check it out!
1145	1	a	This game is great!!!
3732	1	a	One of the best total war games, in my opinion. The battles are quite interesting, especially when you get howitzers. The campaign map can get a little tedious, but overall it is a fun game
5223	1	a	It's well phat, mate.
3141	1	a	This game is great. If you like strategy, warfare games then it's perfect for you. The game is even better if you download the Darthmod. This is by far one of the best games of the Total War series, possibly one of the best strategy war games on the market.
4638	1	a	A game that just about has everything cool in games.  It has Pirates! 'Arrg!' It has Zombies! 'Brains!' It has Civilians! 'Please don't shoot me!' It has Military! 'STOP! We'll shoot!'  And also Bounty Hunters! 'All your rez belongs to us!'  Get it now! Before there's no resource left and the zombies have eaten you alive! ;)
284	0	a	This looked like it might be a good game. Bought it, and spent an hour in the menu trying to get it to work. Mouse won't show up no matter what I did. Tried every forum and fix I could find.  To bad. :/ 
5075	1	a	This is a pretty good game for old school fans of games like Escape Velocity. Unfortunately the game doesn't do a very good job at immersing you like some of those older games do. The universe feels pretty shallow, and some of the tackier interface and portrait artwork can break immersion. Although many aspects are quite antiquated, the combat system is its redeaming factor, and is the primary focus of the game. I would suggest starting with a smaller sized galaxy since progressing through the game's story can drag on a bit and require more grinding otherwise.
1887	1	a	You can conquer Russia.. with Indian elephants.. in winter.               Seems Legit. 10/10 -IGN
680	1	a	This game is great. You should play it.
210	1	a	awsome fun filled game made me forget my girlfriend a must buy if you want to divert your mind into funcoholic!!
1981	1	a	A 'Indian Murder Fest' sim where you play as america and you mow down indians with muskets cause the indians charge at them
1607	1	a	How to play as Russia:  Spawn in as Russia Invade Finland almost instantly Turn to a Communist Dictatorship even though it 1700 &lt;NEXT TURN&gt; Break historical time line Make Austria and Poland-Lithuania ACTUALLY become friends. Recruit 999+ Cossacks Take a break from the game and drink vodka Come back to play game &lt;NEXT TURN&gt; Invade Sweden and Denmark Start rebellion called 'Vodka White Army' Turn back to a Russian Monarchy Make time machine Time back to the beginning of the game.  Congratulations, you be granted a I.D Card to Russian Hell! 
1755	1	a	Beautiful! The best game so far :)
656	1	a	Orcs Must Die is a great mash up of action and strategy. The game can be played with either an action bent or a more strategic mind. As you unlock more weapons and traps, new strategies will become available making old levels fresh again.
4461	1	a	Age of Empires 3. An amazing RTS taking place in the 'New World' during the colonial age. Great game play that keeps you entertained for hours, continuously coming back wanting more!  Pros: -Great game play, keeping you entertained for hours.  -Has funny and entertaining cheats, like 'tuck tuck tuck' which allows you to spawn in a huge monster truck. That will drive over anyone or anything, creating global havoc.  -Has a large supply of maps, each map making you have to adjust your strategic plans to win.  -You get all the DLC's, adds more to the game, civilizations, maps and more!  Cons: -Dying online community and online support, servers can get high amounts of lag. Servers will go offline sometimes even for an entire day.  -Franchise has been disbanded, meaning no more support. No updates, no fixing current glitches.  -Population cap reaches only 200, meaning that your stuck fighting smaller battles.   I would purchase this game on sale, it's worth to get the game. Just not at full price. Overall I will give an overall positive review: 8.3/10
764	1	a	This is a SUPER fun game to play!
1726	1	a	If you like history and you like an indept strategie game than is this something for you!!
1645	1	a	so fun nothing to say its just fun
3498	1	a	really not the best total war but its ok
2977	1	a	This game is awesome. But note, you need to have a good operating system in order to play this game smoothly. I have a DUAL Core Processor with an ASUS HD Series video card, and my game is lagging like hell. But even then i cal play it on the lowest graphics available. Totally worth the money if you ask me though!
2693	1	a	This game is probaly the best stratergy game
160	1	a	gut busters
2748	1	a	It feels a bit like an unfinished beta of Napoleon and not the highpoint of the Total War series. It's enjoyable but a bit generic due to the same reason stated before. But you can play as Sweden. 10/10
110	1	a	 **ACHIEVEMENTS CLEARED (27/27)**  personal score:   B-RANK   price paid:   9.99 USDs //  game of the year package    price history:    buy at a 75%+ price cut  [isthereanydeal.com]   
720	1	a	This game is pure fun. It strikes a tough balance between having traps that are underpowered making the player do all the work, and the traps being overpowered leaving the player with nothing to do but sit back and dodge the bloodsplats. It's always a frantic rush around the level picking off the few stragglers and strategically thinning the ranks with a crossbow or magic spell.
27	1	a	I played a lot of tower defence games in Warcraft 3. But Orcs must die sets a new level in this genre. Combining a 3rd person action game with tower defence, it created the ultimate action survival game. Set in a fictional fantasy universe, you have to defend humanity against hordes of orcs from another dimension. For that, they built big fortress' around the portals, you have to defend.  For that, you not only have weapons and spells, but a big arsenal of traps and mechanical defend systems, from ordinary spike traps to big swinging clubs, burning pits and big brutal mechanical grinders. Every level is made of one or several floors with one or several directions the enemys can spawn. You have to defend the rifts to the normal world, so the orcs dont conquer it.  Using the right collection of traps, wisly using your abilitys and being a tactical genius desides about victory and defeat. The game doesnt take you lightly. With the first levels being easily understandable and mostly fast to solve, some maps are difficult beyond everything encountered before. Some maps need tricks you have to find out all by yourself, some just need you to be fast like sonic, defending two rifts at once.  Having a small storyline, mostly living from comedy, the campaign is really fun to play. After one playthrough you unlock another difficulty, that is a serious challenge (and was a real pain for me).  It isnt a real game for casual players, but a good game, for tacticans, that not only want to think but slay their way through their enemys.
5076	1	a	This is a great 2D game. You need to get past the fact that it is 2D. This game is highly reccomended to those people that played Star Sonata or those gamers out there that like top down games. I have had a lot of fun with it.
4793	1	a	Game rocks! I bought it for 2 bucks and put 50 hours in it. I love the different ships you can aquire and there's so many builds and ways to play! The is a blast to play and the controls are great. It's a really arcade-y feeling game but there's so much depths and upgrades to get (and the upgrades aren't just linear ones).
2445	1	a	Probably my least favorite Total War game. The line infintry mechanic doesnt work that well but it still works. Hand to hand units are still much more satisfying and It takes a little bit of reconditioning to use the gun units effectively if you are use to any of the other Total War games. I would definitely recommend this game for any Total War fans, it won't be your favorite but it'll be different enough that it is challenging but fun. If you have never played a Total War game, do not start here, any of the other games in the series would be a better introduction. (Don't start with Napolean: Total War either)
3753	1	a	Very awesome, very buggy Total War experience. If you are a fan of the time period, you'll love the game, but if you aren't as picky, Shogun 2 is a much better overall game.
4649	1	a	A solid game and a good time Sync. Cant wait for SPAZ 2
1536	1	a	Near perfect game, ever amusing. If you're looking for a good 'ol RTS game to amuse yourself, this is it!
2461	1	a	This game here is a masterpeice. 10/10 for gameplay and strategy and........................tea.
3718	1	a	good historical game i learned a lot from this and actually it helped me pass a History exam so unless you notice the historical things and real information really well then that just adds to the plus of this game. The base game is good you can try the mods if you want but its up too you. I can't really tell you more cause it's really a different experience for everyone its like RTS and Tropico i guess mixed its mostly about war than managing your economy but both play a big aspect.
5162	1	a	The learning curve is not conducive to casual play... beyond that, fun and engaging game.
1881	1	a	Excellent game. Unlimited replayability.
229	1	a	there be goblins
1457	1	a	i recommend this game for anyone who loves military strategy or history
2861	1	a	I like it. Even if it is still a bit buggy.
178	1	a	Fun. Try out OMD 2.
2792	1	a	The best game of the Total War series &lt;3 I've played hundreds of hours before I bought this game on Steam and I can say, that it's still the best strategy experience you can play &lt;3    Bazinga :p   
3443	1	a	The game was innovative back in time when was released, but full of bugs, CTD's, and crazy AI. Today most bugs are already fixed, and AI is now more stable. I have 588 hours of playing, it is addictive, i can pass all the day playing without get tired or bored. Definetly a must have if you have passion for the History of XVII Century. The Last of the Mohicans, Barry Lyndon, The Sovereign's Servant are some films you would love to reenact while gamming.
5112	1	a	Fear the laserboat of doom
1932	1	a	While you waste your time reading this, you could be playing it. If you like total war you will like this. 10/10 The Cake is a lie, Half-Life 3 confirmed
4651	1	a	This game deserves more popularity.
909	1	a	A interactive Tower Defense Game that doesn't have you standing around watching the enemies die to your traps. Countless traps are available, use your sword and bow for direct and ranged combat or use powerful trinkets that give you the ability to control certain elements. Examine your surroundings and build the best death trap possible to hold back the Orcish Horde.  Highly addictive and endless amounts of fun. Well worth the $15.
63	1	a	Really enjoyed playing this game.  Applying third person shooter with a tower defense element was like a match made in heaven with me, the variety of maps, weapons, traps and etc. really made for various types of strategies.  Absolute fun game and was one of the first games i completed for 100% achievements due to the amount of fun I had playing it =]
2488	1	a	fokin beast m8 
152	1	a	Really fun, I love it :) 8/10
3570	1	a	A great game with continuous replay-ability value. One of the very first games I bought on Steam and I have never regretted it, it now has a firm place as my most favorite game on any platform and within any genre.
4146	1	a	great game my 542+ hours on the game prove this, nothing like watching redcoats fire by rank :D
2756	1	a	Well this was a game I was originally excited about. Then when i got it I had realized that it was not as fast paced as past and the now future games in this series.  Cavalry is next to useless until your line infantry gets the enemy to shaken those are my only gripes...  I do feel like the building system makes more sense than Rome total war 2 and many others but it is confusing especially for newer people and if you skip the messages detailing if a new settlement comes up good luck finding it again.  Anyways, in general a good game but all in all this is a slower paced battle game get ready for 30-50 minute battles a lot and the auto-resolve tends to say your professional units will get beat by militia in a seige battle.  Would rate this game a good old 7/10
3536	1	a	One of the best RTS games I've ever played. What makes this game unique is that you can't simply select all units and have them bulldoze their way across the map.
3625	1	a	My computer sucks so Ive been forced to play a dumbed down version of this game and it is still my favorite TW title. That being said I have not had the opportunity to play any TW game released after it. I have enjoyed it so much that I am currently in the process of purchasing the necessary hardware to build a rig that will allow me to play the game as it was meant to be.
2986	0	a	Very good game overall, amazingly fun gameplay. I would rate 10/10 BUT since the company didn't finish the game properly and wont do anything about the campaign bug i'd rate it 3/10. Because when you're in to turn 150 you don't want to lose all of your savings.
4636	1	a	Unique and very worth the purchase.
3699	1	a	Absolutely love this game. Its very realistic and takes lots of strategy to play. However in single-player I wish they had land trade routes, not just sea trade routes.
2670	1	a	Easily one of the best Total War games in terms of scale. The size of the campaign maps (there are 3) are very impressive. The battles ae as like the other games, huge number of troops and tactics are essential, however there are still issues with Siege battles, especially deploying troops onto the walls.    To change the battle mechanics from Close combat and arrows to Guns and close combat has been done very well in this game. There are still plenty of options in terms of formations, alternative weapons and even props to be used in battle (spikes, ditches etc) adds another dynamic to the game.   This game is better than the later Napoleon Total War in terms of scale, yet there are troops that are dangerously similar to other nations but mods attends to this issue.    get the game, it iwill take up so many hours of your life and there is nothing more exciting than taking over the Americas using the Ottoman Empire, imagine if that did actually happen in our history... Well you get to make your own history in this game.
2622	1	a	An awesome Total. The units are amazing and so are the factions.
913	1	a	An excellent single player indie game.  Has 3 game modes - warmage, nightmare and high scoring. Played within that order. Once you have completed the game on nightmare you can aim for the highscore tables, but high scores are achieved by getting combo kills, so require entirely different tactics.   The traps are interesting, there are a handful that you will never use and others you will use in some levels. The swinging mace is one of the most deadly traps you can use.  2 DLCs - Lost adventures adds 5 maps, 1 is a map already in the game played in reverse (a very unique map and a very entertaining map, playing in reverse does make it harder). They also added a handful of new monsters, like the frost bat. Well worth getting.   - the second DLC is not as worth while, contains a few new traps and weapons. Accessable from the start of the game as well, which makes the first few levels extremely easy if used.   However, both DLCs are worthing picking up when on offer.
3193	1	a	It's ok.
3727	1	a	Maybe one day they'll fix the Ottoman Turn Lag glitch, and this game will be playable. But years after release and still no fix, I'll assume they aren't even trying.
449	1	a	Orcs must Die! is a third person action Tower defense game and probably the best when its about the gameplay. You play as a War Mage who needs to defend Gates from ugly Orcs. To do this task you can use Traps and Weapons as well as some envoirmental stuff.   The Gameplay is pretty straight forward. The first Wave and every 5 Waves you have unlimited Time to decide what to Build. Between each other wave you have a time limit until the next wave starts. You can purchase Traps with money. You get money for killing Orcs and you get even more money if you kill Orcs with more than one Trap. The trick is to get as many traps on one place as possible. You need of course something to fight for yourself. For that you can use a magical crossbow that can shoot bolts very fast or a Sword. You can also use magical items to shoot fire or ice and with the DLC you get some interesting items like a pot full of acid which you can throw on the orcs to kill loads of orcs with one attack. All items have a secondary attack that uses mana (In case of the Acid pot it always costs mana to balance it). You can refill your mana at the Gate that you need to defend. Or you can use a magical contraption that refills your mana if you stand next to it. Later in the game you get the wavers, which sell upgrades if you have a spare coin for them.   The grafics are nothing special but the artstyle is great. I always considered that the artstyle is more important than the grafics of a game and Orcs Must Die! is the best example for that. The medival comic look fits nicely with the theme of the game.  The Soundtrack is pretty good. It is mostly medival rock music and fits perfect to the artstyle and the Gameplay.    If you like or dont like this review than please tell me why. If there are grammar problems in the text please let me know.
2798	1	a	THEY'RE ALL DEAD!
1714	1	a	i have had alot of fun with this game in the campain you can choose from a number of nations from the early 1700s like spain and great britain then you advance that country and try to dominate the world it is like a civilization game but with amazing stratigical battles where you have to use tactics to win or you can just have a quick battle against a PC of friend   i strongly recommend this game
879	1	a	this game is a tower defense with some perks too it. dope
2162	1	a	The combination of grand strategy on the map and detailed battles is just perfect. Almost every game of Total War series is pretty good. Highly recommend this one because the background setting is from 1700-1800 which is the most wonderful times in the war history. Seven years war (which can be considered the 'first' world war) and later the French Revolution.
3165	1	a	It's a very epic game. I like Ntw better but it will keep u busy for a long time.
2634	1	a	This game is action-packed, and based on strategy, for people who like RTS, I recomend this game.
2222	0	a	I'm revisiting this game after taking a break for a couple years and now I remember why I stopped. This game should be pretty awesome.   Pros: It's one of the few strategy / RTS games that tackle this time period and specifically focus on the American revolution. Despite what others say, the units make sense since there was lots of a trade and conquering - you should have the ability to have the same technology through and through. Also, if it wasn't balanced, the British would just win every game. But...  CONS: So many. This game is broken. First off, the improvements are largely annoying and require 10 minutes of reading to figure out what they do. The AI will randomly declare war on you which is just not realistic, a common mistake in strategy games. Advisors/scientists/agents etc are a good idea but in this case they don't clearly do much of anything, window dressing. Including India etc but then completely ignoring Africa (probably out of political correctness) - seriously though, the colonies wouldn't exist the way they did without that trade route, even as horrific as it was. But colonists can magically sail to India - right!  You could look past all of this and just do battle and have a great time. That's if the battle system worked. The AI on both sides is laughable. Most of the time they sit around. Even your units that you order, they just sit there. Sometimes if they are engaged, they will stop and just get slaughtered. Sometimes an enemy will run through their lines (in retreat) and they just sit there. Like ' oh, that's weird, there goes the enemy, oh well'. Often the enemy will just sit out in no where or in side castle and not do anything. You could be winning and your army will lose confidence and run away. You could masterfully out maneuver a powerful enemy and you should win but then you don't because your guys that are winning get scared???   This should be a 2.99 game. Or they could fix it but it's probably too late. I recall the early Total War games being a lot more solid.  
71	1	a	I'll keep this short and sweet. This game was a great mash-up between strategy and tower defense. Only took me about 4 hours to beat the whole game. Would have been nice to have some multiplayer/co-op, but for that I'm am looking forward to the sequel. Grab it when it's on sale and spend an afternoon or weekend enjoying this game. Excellent replay value as well.
1877	1	a	Start game Pick Russia Conquer Turkey 10/10 realism
4153	1	a	Great game. Ive been looking a risk loke game thats more complex and this is it. Conquering the earth as russia is great fun
50	1	a	Very addictive!
4681	1	a	This game is highly underated. It's got a great feel to it, with tons of content and gameplay galore. And it can be hard too. Don't expect to breeze your way through, you're going to have to work for your reward. SPAZ is a great example of a good top down space shooter, and I can't recommend it enough.
3949	1	a	Mixed feelings. I really like the game, the setting and everything. But there's the but. Turns are really long even for a Total War game, and I mean waiting for them to change. Some bugs. Provinces a little too big for my taste, then again it does feature Europe, India and America
4109	0	a	Well i downloaded a mod that crashed and i had to reinstall it and they won't respond when i wan't a refund because it is in spanish and i can't changh it so i do not
2064	1	a	My personal favorite TW to date. HUGE battles/campaign map. And the era is just great.
4483	1	a	I finished this game in 64 hours. That wasn't a wasted time, not at all. Because I like tactical strategies and I like RPGs. This game is mainly strategy with active pause. RPG elements is mostly for technical purposes like skills and leveling. So don't expect tons of talking.  But be prepared for tons of space explosions, destroyed and captured star bases, lasers, missiles, dozens of skills, upgrades, ships and all that stuff which should be in game like that. Yes, this game has it all. And all of that in open, procedurally generated world.  VERDICT: If you like space adventures, you will like this one. If you don't, better change your mind. If you really don't, why the hell did you start to read this at all?  Like this review?

4557	1	a	Very fun game, you collect rez, fight off civs or the space police, and try to get through each solar system before you are burned to a crisp. Control many ships, or have your other ships follow you while you control only one. Easy to pick up, hard to master.
133	1	a	This is the orginal, it is better than the sequel (OMD2).
1152	1	a	Worse than Disciples 2, better than Heroes 6
838	1	a	Quite nice TPP tower defense game. A bit like Dungeon Defenders but less spammy, and no local multi.
4873	1	a	Yay. It works.
2752	1	a	Its very fun and addictive and it runs really smooth. Ive had two crashes on napoleon total war and none on this.
3417	1	a	When, as India, I invaded english soil and declared London part of the Indian Empire I knew I was hooked. The stories that you'll create in this game can be historically accurate, or they can be right out of an alternate history novel.  Love it,   When the game first came out, it had plenty of bugs with the AI and graphics, but those have been hammered out now. Great game!
1529	1	a	It's all yours for the taking. Every playthrough. All of it. Go take it.
1070	1	a	bought on sell for 1$, best deal ever. great fun for a 1$
3087	1	a	I jost love this game, one of the best from Total War series
4634	1	a	'If any of the hostages give you any lip, throw em out the airlock with the rest of the trash.'   Space Slaver Sim 2011, 10/10 would buy again.  Seriously though, I regret not picking this up before. Its a 2D isometric space ship pew pew game that kind of tends to lead you along with the promise of new and better ships and upgrades, but along the way teaches you the complexity of said upgrades and combat. The only downfall I'd say it has is the repetitive ambient chatter, and the godawful character faces/avatars, but then again it was made by just two people.   I'm going to put a lot more hours into this. Highly recommended.
528	1	a	Great game, only wish it it had more levels and mutiplayer support. Very satisfying to setup a great defense and watch the orcs get slaughtered.
4809	1	a	Fun 2D space shooter where you have up to 4 ships that you can customize any way you can think of (engines, lasers, rockets, shields, cloaks, reactors, boosters etc.) You can win with many different combinations so it fits with the style you want to play it in. Defidently a grinding, level up game.
2448	1	a	It is a true Total War experience. I was quite afraid of bringing Total War series into 18th century, but Creative Assembly managed to rise to the challenge.   Do not look at my playtime/achivements, I used to play in 'Steam offline' mode. In fact, I consider it as a minor disadvantage, that E:TW requires Steam installed (even when bought from retail)
3442	1	a	Totally awesome Strategy game.
2995	1	a	Great RTS game that, while not as good as Napoleon, is very superb in it's objectives.
257	0	a	Original, Fast Paced and Damn Addictive.  All 3 describe this game to maximum precision. It is such a fun game, hours can be eaten away form your hands playing through the extensive single player campaign. It does lack the single most important thing that would make this game more fun.   Multiplayer.  Seriously, without it, this game is bland, you want to experience the Orc mayhem with your buddies. Skip this one, go for the sequel.  WompWompWommmmmp/10
321	1	a	Another hidden gem on Steam, bought for less than Â£3 it is terrific value for money. An interesting twist on the tower defence games (a firm favourite of mine) it sees you stopping orcs using an elabarate range of traps and defences. A great buy at a great price.
4708	1	a	I finished this game to 100% any enjoyed every bit of it!
1123	1	a	This is where it all started, Orcs fighting rpg tower defence type of story yaq know.
474	1	a	That's just too much fun for 4 bucks.
3578	1	a	A rippin' good time, this one.
5006	1	a	This is ownage
4296	1	a	If you have treied the other Total War games in the series this is an easy buy. If not the tutorial campaign will introduce you to the features and get you going on your way to fun!
761	1	a	i killed a lot of orcs. it was pretty fun. definitely worth a few dollars. give green to kill green. orc are scum kill all orc.
3459	1	a	Absolutly a stratagy game takes place in the 17th-18th century, definatly realistic with huge armies at your disposal, however, if you are one to stress over your country being wiped out overnight, or so much debt that your people rebel. its probably not for you.
3694	1	a	I have a lot of time in this game.... the only reason I stopped is because Total War rome 2 came out. But I'm sure i'll be back. Really great game and time bandit.
723	1	a	great single player game
1731	1	a	Best strategy game behind minesweeper.
4098	1	a	&gt;play as sweden &gt;'dont invade russia in winter' &gt;does that &gt;mfw i win &gt;russia is now swedish &gt;go on to fight a 30 year war against austria, and poland &gt;prussia goes full hitler and almost conquers all of central europe &gt;i go full allies, prussia is gone &gt;i control almost all of central and eastern europe &gt;fight hard war against france and spain &gt;i win again &gt; france is now swedish &gt;spain stays spainish sadly &gt;invade my longest ally, great britain &gt;take over the british isles &gt;wtf.jpg &gt;fight ridiculous war against spain &gt;ally with the usa for 5000 &gt;they break alliance next turn &gt;usa is now swedish &gt;mfw i conquered all of the united states because of 5000 dollars &gt;revolution in my nation &gt;rebellions across the great empire &gt;empire falls &gt;god laughs at me &gt;wife leaves me &gt;evicted from my aparment  12/10 would conquer the world again and then lose it all to democracy
3303	1	a	When you get DARTHMOD for this game it becomes Da bomb yo !
330	1	a	Pretty fun game. It's a tower defense game, but it's also a 3rd person action game. I do not like regular tower defense games, as they are all about setting up a defense and then waiting for the wave to end. In this one, you get to pick various weapons to fight off the enemies, while setting traps and defenses. Definitely give this game a try, and buy it if it goes on sale again!
4811	1	a	A game that combines a Asteroid esque type game. Enjoyable and repetitive. Still I can't recommend it enough, its only missing ninjas!
2033	1	a	Brilliant Strat Game, one of the best!
2005	1	a	10/10, Would TAKE OVER THE WORLD with Prussia again.
4801	1	a	
4866	1	a	A really addictive spave RPG, A++
1572	1	a	I don't ever write reviews for games because most of you all do the job for me. But I have to at least write one line for this game. It's definitely worth investing 5 bucks in! BA game, BOOM SHACKALACKA
760	1	a	Incredibly fun, witty, and challenging. Not your typical tower defense game; with gorgeous graphics, fun dialogue, and a soundtrack that sounds like Mastadon did a Gregorian Chant album. Addictive gameplay that is absolutely worth the price!
4914	1	a	You get to explore space, customize and upgrade your fleet, and fight zombies.  Plus, Totalbiscuit is the narator.
1606	1	a	Being my first Total War game, I love the RTS aspects of this game, but is best shown in the actual skirmish battles on land, I mean sea is fun but somewhat confusing with intricate controls. The scale of battles with hundreds of troops under your command is amazing, playing it on PC is really addicting but now that I find that it is available on Mac I question the decision to lessen troops in each unit group. I mean really from 120 units in a group to 40? That is just strange to me and I hope that the Mac version can live up to the Windows version.
4185	1	a	This is the first game I played in the series and runs best on my low graphics computer. Second best to Napoleon Total War
231	1	a	The best 'tower defense' game I ever played.
3257	1	a	Great game! Its a must buy!
156	1	a	I wasn't expecting this to be so outrageously fun. I bought it in a sale and was not disappointed at all.  Very fun!
2745	1	a	Terrific. Installed Minor Faction's revenge mod and chose Mexico as my faction...First I spend all my funds on the resources in the nation that are undeveloped. I develop trade relations with France, England, and several others. I tax my capital heavily in order to spark a revolution to change my government, okay, so now three turns later, nearly all my resources have been developed, and a revolution has sparked up. I side with the rebels, and sweep through my capital pretty easily. The new Mexico is a republic, but no one seems to mind. I now spend all my funds on the military, building up a powerful navy and strong land force. Alright, expansion into central America and the carribbean is needed, so I declare war on spain after allying myself with England. None of my allies come to help, so it's a 1v1 with spain. I quickly board my men on my ships, and invade Cuba, sweep through, and then use my navy to knock out spain's current fleet in the Atlantic. With Spain's navy down, I can transport troops in and out as I please, and soon enough I have taken a majority of the carribbean and even Florida. Now I focus on Central America. I land a full stack of troops after waiting for 2-3 turns near Gualtmela (I can't spell it.) Where I face an army the same size as mine. My general's level is higher, and my men are experienced...I take the risk and auto-resolve it, and I win a heroic victory with only three hundred down. I invade the region capital, and suprisingly, without my garrison the populace stays content. No spainards are around, so I leave the region and invade Panama, occupying it. ALright, Spain has been booted out of the Americas...they've angered GB and are at war with them...but little did I realize the united provinces somehow JOINED Spain in their war against me, and blockaded my trade routes, cutting off my income from the Maratha Confederacy. Soon enough, they've landed a force in Cuba and blockaded my ports their with a full stack of ships...  ---------------------------------------------------------------  The game is nice and has excellent mods, but the vanilla is still good. I love just watching my men get in position as Native Americans charge at me with their axes charging while my musketmen just fire off one volley and it's like: 'Newbs, get rekt' and the natives retreat after their lines are decimated.  The only flaw is not being able to suicide ram with ships.
1202	1	a	This product has been released for more than 6 months via gamersgate and is a reimagining.It borrows alot from Disciples 2 and it's definately the Disciples 3 you want to own. The short vid and the game discriptions pretty much tell you of all the changes. I owned all previous version and had no hesitation buying this more complete version. It's not as easy as King's Bounty.The crucial thing in Disciples is getting a good start and looking for the easier targets early on to get you that good start.
1480	1	a	This game works 100% buy it if you want to wait 300 seconds to play a game then be dropped immediatly, seriously tho its so fun i have 3 hrs on record and i played 1 game
237	1	a	awesome game for lovers of third person 
1290	1	a	For me still one of the best TW games ... after the 'desease' at release with a bunch of patches solved most problems of the game during the following months. This was a hard time for many hardcore TW fans and many were really annoyed with it or still are. This is understand able, because many of the bugs were silly at least, as well some of the patches made things worse but did not improve problems. So players become feeling to be the beta testing object for CA for a still bought, but very bugged game and this is not acceptable. Empire is now running very good, but in combination with Darth Mod which improves the game to a status, which normally should be delivered by Creative Assembly itself in my opinion. I don't know in detail how Darth and his modding team did improve, but the result is only great. For example, the AI was really improved - not that AI becomes a smart enemy in campaign, but the acting was put by Darth into good rails of logical issue. Some things were improved by simple overwriting, for example the masses of merchant ships build by AI insteed war ships with the simple solution to let recruit smaller war ships (up to 4th class) in merchant ports too. I played Napoleon very often too and some of the the improvements here are missing in Empire. Napoleon itself is very interesting too, but for me too local and too small as campaign map.  To be honest, the following Shogun TW and RTW-2 brought further, very good improvements in game, but these games did not convince me to play further. RTW-2 has for me a very bad graphic and game hub design which did me more annoy as giving fun.  In conclusion, Empire is still my favorite TW game and still makes fun after nearly 3,500 hours game time!
3336	1	a	Excellent strategy game and a must have for military history nuts of the colonial time period.
4346	1	a	everything has been already said about this series of games - just great!!!
2535	1	a	great gunpowder action, more realistic charges and reactions of cavalry, this one is really awesome in terms of head-on rifle fighting. âDonât fire till you see the whites of their eyes!â
4059	1	a	This game made me clense America of all the indian savages. 11/10 for Accuracy.
1695	1	a	For a great high graphic strategy game with resounding multiplayer and an excellent single player campaign. This game is Amazing!!!!!
3529	1	a	Excellent game, campaign mode a little dull, only if campaign mode came from Europa Universalis and battle mode from this game...
4900	1	a	This game is fun, but procedural generation is (in general) sort of boring. There are lots of systems, to unlock to get to the core but they are all the same. The thing that adds interest is the progression of unlocking new ships and new weapons and you discover and buy them.  Good tip if you are starting: If a faction has things for sale in a certain system, do the quests in that system that make them like you so you can buy it.   Will anyone ever make a game as good as Escape Velocity: Nova? Thats what I want! Seriously if you know of one please send me a message.
2580	1	a	It is very fun and exiting, and has lots of suprises.
707	1	a	Very cool little indie gem right here! :) Got awesome graphics and it's pretty chalenging!! 8/10 for me ;) I definatelly recomend it
3869	1	a	Empire Total War is a really neat Total War game, it has great tactics, good multiplayer, and good graphics. Sure, napoleon may have better graphics or what ever, but Empire is simple and fun, and I am sticking to it.
2644	1	a	Best Total War! The Greatest RTS Game of ALL Time! If you don't have Empire Total War, then your Computer Sucks!
2294	0	a	The Graphic are like you`re in 1990's
1456	1	a	Love it. Great game.
800	1	a	Great hero TD
2815	1	a	*This is a footage of in-Game experience (like they say in every game trailer)* 10/10 would drop the global ivory price to 1 with my trade ships again. 10/10 would fire all the minister who hadden't nice wig again. 10/10 would burn India with American Indians again. 10/10 would burn hollywood and change it to bollywood with my Indian Indians again. 10/10 would nuke Moscow with my Turkish mortars again. 10/10 would loose all my Gentleman by duels because I wanted to see those little shortcuts again. 10/10 would trade Ireland to the Ottomans for Greece again. 10/10 would fight the Dutch, American, Maratha and Protestantism revolution again. 10/10 would dump all my militia in Iceland again. (Really who the â¥â¥â¥â¥ cares about Iceland) 10/10 would burn, â¥â¥â¥â¥ and loot all of southern America with only 4 milita units again. 10/10 would spread Hinduism to America again. 10/10 would accept money for alliance and attack them 1 turn later again. 10/10 would want to kill Prince Eugen von Savoyen with my first cannon shot in the game again. (Austrian head general) 10/10 would Fus Roh Dah the greybeards from the Throad of the world again. Wait wrong game? 10/10 probably should go to bed now. 10/10 seriously. --------+ 160/10 â¥â¥â¥â¥ing buy this game!     
3302	1	a	This is a great game, the graphics are neat and it is cool to see the mesket men run accross the battle fiels.
3745	1	a	
2135	1	a	i learn about europe and america more than in classroom
2791	0	a	This game is a missed opportunity. It can be fun, but continually crashes with 'Application crash at empire.exe' errors. Too bad.
4386	1	a	'WHAT 15 HOURS!!!!!!!!!! Ow well at least the world is finaly mine!' this is one of the best harcore statigy games in the world todate
4330	1	a	A haiku summing up my feels on Empire:  Ahh, Enlightenment; Empires, colonies, trade; But no bug testing.  (As a German major who's all about Enlightenment-era Europe, I was also all about a grand strategy game that highlighted this period of history. However, with how buggy and broken this game was on release (and how even now, getting regiments across bridges is enough to want to rip your hair out), any grandness Empire: TW could've had was then crushed by Napoleon then after, which was a lot better polished and optimized. Though it's nice CA learned from their mistakes by Napoleon's release, but a shame Empire had to be a casualty to it in the meantime. I still recommend this game, however, as its low cost and third-party mods make the experience a bit more bearable.)
3092	1	a	Such a wonderful game, I would really have to look for something bad to say.
3405	1	a	I love all the total war games but I always come back to Empire. Great Game
3891	1	a	Very good TW game probably one of the best.
3984	1	a	- Starts warpath campaign as Plains Nation - Creates an army and destroys Upper Louisiana - Notices the US is also at war with spain - Offers a deal to the USA for a military alliance - Deal is denied - Tries again this time offering 5000 gold - Deal is denied - 20 Turns later with 42000 gold I try again - USA Accepts Alliance - Smirks and begins to move all armies to New Orleans - USA Has cancelled Alliance with you - *Throws monitor out window and burns disk*  10/10 Would lose 42000 Gold again.
4500	1	a	I haven't spent much of my time playing this game, but what I have experienced I have enjoyed. With many ship types, equipment combinations, and faction choices, this game will offer you many space age hours of enjoyable gameplay. I look forward to getting further into it when I have more time to dedicate. If you can get it on sale, don't miss out on the opportunity.
719	1	a	A fantastic frantically paced tower defense/action hybrid done right. Good for hours upon hours of simple orc and ogre slaying delight.
2382	1	a	maybe not as good as MTW2 but it has everything if you like the thin red line
2486	1	a	great game but long installation time on steam
3093	1	a	Excellent game. It's like RISK on steroids. It's turn based, and is very reminiscent of games like Civilization, but the combat system is awesome, and the battles are epic. It's quite fun to see your army of 1500+ units on the field stoming a fort. The naval battles are pretty epic as well, and they do them quite well. If you are a fan of turn based strategy games, with some real time elements, I highly recommend this series. 
4008	1	a	AWESOME!!THIS HAS SOME GLITCHES SO WHAT THIS IS AWESOM!!!!!!
2110	1	a	the best total war so far 
4817	1	a	With an ongoing development and updating of the game, the game has a lot of re-playablitiy, a funny and entertaining story, varied difficulties and multiple types of missions in which you will play throughout the game.  Some parts near the end might be a little rince and repeat, but i have to say that for a game this cheap, it took me 66hours to finish the game. This was with standard difficulty and standard size of the galaxy. Having said that, i did not even explore everything even with those amount of hours played.  For people who want a different pace, and a game in which they can pick up and play from time to time. Then i can highly recommend SPAZ. It's fun, addictive at times, and it's also very easy to pick up even after not having played it for 2 weeks. 
1556	1	a	By far the best total war since the original. Huge scale, big improvments to unit fighting and the time period of the units works well with this style of game play. It's much less...involved than the all melee ones. You're not constantly reogranizing formations or chasing units all over the map.
3260	1	a	Total War has always shown a great mix of historical accuracy, strategic depth, and tactical genius. Empire total war extends this thoguht process into a near era of game style. This game reflects well upon how the period conducted itself and helps you really grasp things associated with the period. I'd heartily suggest it for the Turn based strategy gamer who wants something faster, or the RTS gamer who wants more depth. It can also be fun first Turn based strategy experience for people not used to it since it ahs the fast paced Tactical Real Time battles alongside the grand map.
3150	0	a	This is ABSOLUTELY ATROCIOUS.
543	1	a	This is one of the best action tower defence games I have played. really fun traps and combos and freedom to run around fighting makes this a nice gem. lack of multiplayer or co-op is the only bad thing, but even solo is still alot of fun
5137	1	a	A must have for any avid strategy nut. And you don't even need to be THAT skilled with real time to beat the game! get it now!
3167	1	a	Best Total War in my opinion
3953	1	a	For those who loved Cossacks II: Napoleonic Wars,this is a must have!
797	1	a	This is the only tower defense game other than Revenge of the Titans that has held my interest for more than a few minutes. You'd think I'd like Sanctum better due to my preference for sci-fi over fantasy settings, but I couldn't get into Sanctum at all.
4910	1	a	This game is one of the most fun heavy grinders out there ... especially on insane difficulty. A perfect game to play in 1-2 hour sittings
41	1	a	A nice little take on the tower defense and the third person shooter genres. The only draw back outside of the weapon DLC being a bit overpriced for what it gives you is that the main charecters limited repitor of speech files can get a bit grating after a few levels. But if you like tower defense games or even Dungeon Defenders but wished it's single player was better you will like this game.
2653	1	a	GAME IS BEST TOTAL WAR
1116	1	a	Pretty much a 3d version of those 2d flash games where you upgrade and progress through endless waves of killing â¥â¥â¥â¥. It also has some strategic challenges, so its fun to play on a rainy day
4695	1	a	Definatly a good game with decent replay value. If you have a few $$$ to spend- this wouldnt be a bad place to start.
4218	1	a	i love this game 
181	1	a	I feel sorry for the female orcs..........
3941	1	a	Great Game! Big maps, 18th Century Warfare, Not much bugs. 9/10
786	1	a	Killing Orcs in a FPS/Stragedy world.. How does it get any better.
2557	1	a	This is a astonishing grand strategy game. The combat is awesome and well-polished, the overland map is well developed, and it is the only total war game to feature the whole world to date, the only problem is that they haven't made a sequel for it.
3390	1	a	do you like all the Total War games?? then is Empire TW what you looking for, it is very complicated but when you have play itr for more then 1 hour you're really enjoy it, 
3930	1	a	Had ottoman organ gun set up in front of fort gate in case they busted through. They did. General charged in and organ guns killed the entire unit. He was the strongest general and the only think keeping the army together. The entire army retreated. Lost battle in 2 minutes 10/10
2866	1	a	Amazing game, Great graphics even on low, can run on ALMOST any computer, i love this game, you should download it
4068	1	a	Love it
4460	1	a	This is a very solid game. I was expecting this game to be absolutely awful, however, in playing it and completing all three campaigns on normal in about 19 hours, it was an enjoyable game. The campaign is above-average, and the variety of the campaign is solid, yet it can become repeatitive, in my opinion.  The AI is very solid, they act like they know what to do. This, with the gameplay, cooperates and makes it a very fun experience for strategy gamers because the gameplay, is as normal with Age of Empire series, is great.  The graphics are dated, however they are not all that bad.  People still play multiplayer, and MP is very fun, as it has modded modes, to just normal gameplay, so the community is not dead.  Overall, I would recommend this game to any strategy fan. The overall experience is worth the price tag.  8/10.  ----  Thanks for reading my review!

1219	1	a	 A 'rough gem'.
4293	1	a	One of the best startegy games i have played strongly reccomend
3152	1	a	A well made game. Would like to conquer more of the world though.
577	1	a	Fun game with good strategy components, but with an overall action feel. It allows the player to choose a field control, crowd control or more basic hack and slash approach to the level. Not a lot of replayability, but worth a couple of bucks to play.
4518	1	a	A MUST BUY. EXTREMELY GOOD GAME.  An awesome 2D top-down space shooting and exploring game, well balanced, with a strong if a bit predictable and cliched main plot. Delivers an extremely satisfying experience in combat, has a light design-your-own-spaceship element - you choose a weapon layout for pre-determined hulls with some ability to modify the bahaviour and handling of your ships - which is excellently done and delivers a ton of fun.  All the elements of the game are extremely well done, polished and provide a ton of fun and relaxing space shooting experience. Highly recommended. Probably the best 2d top-down exploration-style shooter ever created.
1115	1	a	OMG, best game ever you will like it so much, just buy the game you will not regret buying this game
4792	1	a	Everything you want in a PC game. It is like MOO and SC combined.
3820	1	a	If you like building empires and fighting battles in real time then this is the game for it. The battles can easily be decided by something as simple as a single unit routing in battle, and battles can change on a dime making battles very tatically demanding on land or sea. Personally I enjoy land battles much more than sea battles despite the big explosions, this is mainly due to the fact it is easier to avouid friendly fire and is less confusing.

548	1	a	By far the most entertaining and inventive ego-shootish game I have played in the last couple of years.   Players having a knack for frantic, challenging, but nevertheless highly strategic action, HAVE TO GIVE IT A TRY.
4156	1	a	Dating rapidly and looking forward to Empire 2 (assuming they don't pull a Rome 2 and ruin the game). Still, loved playing the game and recommend. 7/10
2651	1	a	Probably the finest total war game done. the system was easy to use. Quick to learn very hard to master and it feels balanced and rewarding. Who doesnt enjoy wiping out the French as Britain or stabbing Great Britain in the back with the United Provinces. Employ diplomacy as you quench your Thirst for glory and conquer the World.    
4297	1	a	best total war game
5188	1	a	This is a fun and cheap indie game. I've really enjoyed playing with the different ship loadouts and trying to combo them together in unique ways. It's a basic top down 2D shooter type with spaceships. The physics are a little strange at first, but easy to get the hang of. Once you start planet hoping and blasting through the security gates, the game really picks up.  Don't be afraid to wrekt everyone that gets in your way. You earn more by killing enemies than anything else. Relationships with the UTA/Civs don't really matter unless you can't wipe them out easily.  My only complaint: The AI for your ships auto-pilot is horrible. The programming for any advanced tactics isn't really there. My ships often would fly directly into the face of enemy fleets and sit still trying to face off against everything at once, no evasive manuevers of any kind. There's not really anything you can do about it except try to switch and make them move out of the line of fire quickly. However, the instant you leave a ship... it begins Rambo-ing in.  But honestly that didn't become a big issue until near the end when ships are expensive and extremely powerful.  I've had a great time playing despite the AI weakness
1487	1	a	Love it.
652	1	a	cool game, better then i expected, can't remember if i got it for 10$ with the 2 dlc's or what. Game reminds me of torchlight, the colors, architecture &amp; music is ALL very pleasant &amp; i would reccomend this game + dlc for 10$ without much question. I have played it for like 4 hrs so i don't know how much better it will get but i do NOT regret getting it though i never really wanted to begin with. Can't give a out of 10 since i haven't completed at least 50%. Fun game it is.
3979	1	a	i think this game is really good and i enjoy it a lot. this is by far one of the BEST total war games i have ever played
4242	1	a	Love this game so much, But it is so complicated
811	1	a	This game is worth all the money you'll ever put into hospital and electiricy bills.
1769	1	a	This is what happens when you give a bunch of history nerds a stupid amount of money. Great going, SEGA, because Africa wasn't starving or killing itself slowly from the inside in the most socially decisive and destructive way possible or anything. Selfish â¥â¥â¥â¥s.  Fantastically produced bla bla bla yadayada! Graphics are as about as impressive as this rotting half eaten Snickers bar hidden under my bed. I can see it now. Nope. Still not impressed. Combat is extremely pointless. Why fight when there is a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing 'Resolve Battle' button. Seriously SEGA, you dropped the ball on this one. Instead of pouring millions into a luke warm awful combat system, EXPAND ON THE 'Resolve Battle' BUTTON. Seriously. DROWN THAT â¥â¥â¥â¥ IN DLC. I want flashy buttons, themed buttons, buttons with Christmas lights dangling off it around Christams time (and Jew lights for whatever the Jew holiday is). Dialogue consists of drinking tea and screaming from a fatal musket shot to your scrotum. Campaign is boring.  My advice: Kill yourself.  You â¥â¥â¥â¥.
3007	1	a	A review for a game of this quality can be short and sweet. This is a thoroughly playable and enjoyable game (even in 2016). Three quick tips are... 1 - turn your phone off 2 - save your game regularly  3 - immerse yourself
1398	1	a	By far the most realistic combat I have seen in a video game that is based around this era. The strategy, skill, adaptiveness, and flexibility required to skillfully achieve victory in this game, per battle or per campaign, is genuinely unlike anything I've seen before. A 9/10 must own for any moderately skilled strategist. My only regret is that the Grand Campaign is not available for multiplayer, for I would like nothing more than to have my companions march a campaign by my side. Besides that, I believe this game, though somewhat dated in graphics by today's standards, Is worth a try for strategy gamers everywhere.
278	0	a	I like dugeon defenders better than this game
3795	1	a	In this game, as the Ottomans, I did the one thing both Napoleon and Hitler cound not do.   I CONQUERED RUSSIA.  
2130	0	a	Do not buy it. Have wasted hours playing it three times each time to have it crash 50 years in before game end. Impossible to avoid a freeze of the AI. Using previous saves still results in the AI freezing at said turn. Total War should be ashamed for releasing this without a patch to fix such. And yes I have looked about for one. Buy something decent. MBU
2609	1	a	fun custom battles
1429	1	a	It's just like a little, handicapped puppy - it's not perfect, but it's trying so hard to satisfy your expectations. 
3538	1	a	Awesome game. I got it after all the bugs were fixed. Its the first of the series I'd played, and my god was it good/is still good to play now and again. The naval battles are nothing short of epic, and not being a huge gamer before this, the cannons firing right next to you, and exploding right next to you, was an interesting experience, it really puts you into the battle. I've actually learned abit about this time period from this game, and its given me an interest in this time period. I think I've clocked up the most steam hours with this game, although civ 5 might be a bit higher. But anyway, I would definately recommend this amazing game.
5328	1	a	when you begin: you will get rekt. you will forget what keys to use. you will try to quickscope. you will try to kill teammates. you will create a character with outfits that make absolutely no sense but you won't even know. you will try to spot enemies. you will try to charge in on your own. you will try to change the buttons but you will most likely fail. you will get banned for no reason.  but remember, it will be worth it because you're gonna turn into a fine warrior.
2943	1	a	Not the very best of the series. Had the disadvantage of being the first of the change that occured in the TW franchise. Most of the time, it felt like a beta of Napoleon Total War, a game that should be part of a larger Empire Total War and not seperate. Anyways, the new game mechanics (of that time) caused a few problems, at the beginning, for the experienced R:TW and M2:TW players (or older) but, eventually, we got used to it. I'm posting this critic right now 'cause it's sales time. So, someone might be interested in buying it. For a cheap, nice price, give it a try or have it, if you can afford it, as a cosmetic thingy in your Games-section. No matter its (many) problems, still, to this day, remains a game I'll always remember.
1704	1	a	Empire TW is by far the best Real Time Statergy game I've ever played. This game is so sharp when it comes to historical accuracy. The battles and campaigns are exceptionally superb. This game will bring to test your mind as you try to out think and out class your rivals on the continents of Europe and the Americas aswell as the Indian Sub-Continent. Your capabilities as a general in the heat of battle will also be tested, as you fight the huge mass armies of your enemy. This game also has a broad variety of mods aswell, so you'll get bored of play this game. Empire TW is completely sandbox and so you are free to wage war with anyone at anytime. I highly recommend this game!
2381	1	a	greatest total war game even the newer ones dont come close
3272	1	a	top game a must buy :D
836	1	a	And oh how they must die. And by so many methods! A great game that tests the ingenuity of your trap placement to maximize the rate of destructive carnage against many enemy types. It's also very accessible for those with limited time, as levels usually lasts less than 15 minutes.
4602	1	a	This game is fantastic. Lots of customization and different ways to blast through. sense of freedom and accomplishment when you figure things out. I'm barely into it but I'm recommending it to anyone I know or game with. Looking forward to future titles from these people.
710	1	a	A fun and awesome Tower Defense game, has plenty of strategic oppertunities and is really fun 10/10
131	1	a	Very addicting
2143	1	a	Started as Austria, attacked Russia and won. I am the greatest nation and will conquest all of the world-Austrian King
334	1	a	A neat game that I would recommend picking up on sale if you're looking at it. The overall quality is surprisingly polished and the game is challenging, particularly in Nightmare mode. Takes ~12 hours to complete in Normal mode and ~24 hours to complete in Nightmare mode.
983	1	a	All kinds of fun - good strategy game with a big leap in dificulty and a nice sprinkle of humor.  Easliy the best Â£2.99 I ever spent.
3669	1	a	They're serving vodka in every corner of the globe now. Glory to Mother Russia, comrades. 10/10 absolutely
2900	1	a	No game is 100% bug free. That being said this game is a great continuation of the Total War franchise. The ability to actually fight out naval battles, and the importance of the navy to aquire and protect trade routes was perhaps the best addition to the game for me. The added dimension of having multiple 'zones' (Europe, India, New World, +trade zones) made the game truely feel like a 'whole world' experience.  I was worried about the 'age of gunpowder' disrupting the feel of the Total War francise. I worried for nothing. If i have any reservations about gunpowder is was in the cannon units (most times i just build the most powerful of the 'old' cannons, even though they were fixed pices on the map and took longer to build).   Also, playing a different nation really changed the strategy required to win in several campains. how much navy,capture how many trade ports, how much diplomacy, abandon mele units or not? (p.s. in india a few swordsman units are a good economical value). Focus on just one 'zone' or two....or try to litterally 'take over the world'?  I poured many many hours into this game - lots of replay value.
1340	1	a	*Goes as Prussia* *Wants to imitate Colonial-Era Europeans*  *Invades Africa and conquers Morrocco*  *Recruits an army of Africans in Prussian Military* *England and all rest of Europe wants help attacking France* *Captures Paris with an army of Morroccans*  11/10 Would invade France with German Morroccans again.
2274	0	a	Campaign mode is my favorite part of Total War games. Rome 2 comes with a terrible campaign mode. In fact all of their games since Medieval 2 have had a terrible campaign mode. I have Empire and Rome 2 in my library but never play them. I have enjoyed Rome 1 and Medieval 2 but I will never buy another Total War game. I look elsewhere for my turn-based games.
3484	1	a	If you like Strategy gaming this is one of the Best in the Genre.
2722	1	a	Brilliantly done, especially with the types mods across the internet. It really gives you the sense that you are commanding your own nation. Recommended to anyone who is interested in history and the idea of diplomatic relations.
2290	0	a	Bad game. Not worth any money.
130	1	a	One of the better tower defense games I have played. I'm more of a co-op gamer though, but when there is no one to play Orcs 2 with then this is a nice alternative, considering Orcs 2 is impossible solo.
2039	1	a	Hey guys were goin' way back in time with this game, Empire Total War was one of the first Total War games along side Rome and Shogun. Empire is a strategy game where you can go in deep and command your soldiers as they battle with muskets and cannons or stay far away and command on a global state. Build or upgrade cities, research technology, or build a great army to conquer your enemies. Be any country in India, North America, or Europe and try to survive the 1700's. Check this game out and enjoy conquering the world.
920	1	a	Extremely fun and addictive. Also a good way to improve your 'thinking outside the box'.
5117	1	a	All the fun of a top-down space shooter and RPG. Very reminiscent of Star Control II in many ways. Fun strategy and great battle and upgrade options. Story is OK - but like many RPG's, can get a little repetetive and straightforward.
4813	1	a	The dev said they didnt see any games of the kind and did it thenselves and did it GOOD , its not repetitive as some may describe (like a shooting game you have to shoot and that doesnt make it repetitive) has a very good storyline and playability is awesome , you have to kill a ship to use it or at late game it come by killing some other high level zombie. you get what u fight for and survive to harvest and atack!!!
2168	0	a	This is a long, long, long, drawn out game. I can see many weeks being sunk into one campaign. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, and I was quite enjoying playing it.  Downside?  Well, I can't play it anymore. Constantly crashes on load up EVERY time I open it. I've tried all the fixes I can find online. Nothing works. Beginning the process of getting a refund. Save yourself the trouble and give this one a miss.
2028	1	a	ITS FRICKING AWESOME BEST RTS EVER oh and rts= real time stratagey
1129	1	a	Easily the best 15 bucks I've ever spent :)
4049	1	a	tottaly awesome game if you like strategy!=)
4520	1	a	SPAZ is not the sort of game I'm really good at. Nevertheless, I found myself dumping heaps of time into the game. I recently started a game and found quite a bit of new content had been added. Definitely a cool surprise and even better that I didn't have to buy some DLC to get it. The community for this game seems to be pretty active and a variety of mods can be found.
1031	1	a	This game is seriously addictive and very fun. If you enjoy tower defense games and always wished you could be down there to get that damn last straggler, this is your game. Tons of replay value, and quite funny to boot. Make sure you get the artifacts of power DLC though, that stuff is great!
2098	1	a	You can't take this game seriosly... it's just to much fun. 9.75471/2 IGN
1248	1	a	It's oke, i r&amp; 8/8 pls no h&amp; i'll open the g&amp; for my m&amp;
1191	0	a	Well, I loved Disciples II. I played the game for countless hours. I loved the artwork, I loved the races, I loved the gameplay. It was a great, darker alternative to that other fantasy strategy/RPG game. There was just something about the game that enthralled me. I really wanted the next installment to be like the second. Unfortunately, it's not.  It looks like the AI is basically set up in such a manner that the higher the difficulty, the more your units just plain suck at combat.  First encounter into the game, my units miss more than they hit. Miss, miss, miss. That's what I saw in the first encounter. And the second. And the third.  The problem is, there's nothing I can do tactically to change this. I can jump on the focus points all I want in combat, but if my units still just whiff every time, I've got no chance. And if the enemy pounced on the focus points before I have a chance to? Well, forget it.  I've played the game for a couple of hours, and already I just plain despise it. I don't mind losing if it's because of the wrong tactical choices I've made, but when I've got no chance as a LVL 1 party because we just miss every time, forget it. I'm done.  I wanted to love this game because I adored the predecessors. This one just makes me never want to play it again.
4699	1	a	So far I'd say I have spent more time in the hangar costumizing my fleet and trying to figure out the best trade offs to be made than actually blowing up enemy ships. This game has a very decent variety of weapons, sub systems, mounts, armors, shields, engines and all that good stuff you can apply to your ships in order to costumize them. Ships of all classes and sizes are available (fighters, support ships, battleships, mining ships, mass bomb carriers), you just have to unlock them by a very simple unlock system (blow up the ship you want and collect its black box from the remains). The battles are fun and actually require you to maneuver your ship around in a strategic fashion in order to get the best from your beams, cannons, turrets...and also to avoid enemy fire. For a 2 man work, this game is a blast.
4497	1	a	Fun game, reminds me of the Escape Velocity games back in the 90's. Great Mod support and community on the games official webpage. Cannot wait until the sequel.
240	1	a	best played multiplayer though
4706	1	a	Very well made, funny and engaging storyline.  I can't say the game has great replayability - though I do like to replay it once every few years.   Sequel is out now, and while it's very different, it's just as enjoyable and if you like this I recommend it as well.
2179	1	a	Steam features a wide variety of games, and Empire: Total War is no exception.  Play as an 18th century superpower, or pick America and pretend to be relevant; expand your overseas colonies, wrestle for control of the seas, and hope your game doesn't crash when you click the End Turn button. The possibilities are literally endless.
2393	1	a	Well 360hrs + and still going nothing else to say really//
1957	0	a	As of 5/11/2016 (or 11/5 for you americans) 1.5 version This game still isnt fixed. IVE NEVER FINISHED THIS CAMPAIGN. EVER. As soon as i get late game my Autosaves, Manual Saves and Quick Saves corrupt. I have to start over again. Do not purchase this game if you anticipate having a smooth time because you wont. This game is amazing and i love the span of Empire but CA you need to fix your bloody game.
2515	1	a	this is an old game but i still play it all the time, such a good game i think, best total war game out by far.
2714	1	a	The game freezes too much
3885	1	a	  The following content in this game, it has:
5224	1	a	A little slow at first, but once you get your first few blueprints for new ships, the amount of customziation you can do is amazing!  Fun top-down space shooter, a blend of space invaders, battletech, and Duke Nukem [the humor]. The grahics are both fun, and don't seem to get old very fast. Space shooter plus customizable space craft &amp; tech tree to support your particular playstyle. Like missles or lazers? Want to use mega-bombers, or carriers with a small fleet of its own craft? You get to decide which ships to build in your 'home base', how they are armed, etc.  Well worth the price.
1452	1	a	Freak'n muskets MAN! How could you resist!?!  Also this is a lot more fun with Darthmod :D as it improves a lot of the game's features.
1921	1	a	Amazing representation of the total war games My opinion the best intro to the games as it includes some of the new features but is still not as complicated as the newer versions
4183	1	a	Addictive, a good way to spend the night, great for people who want to relax and great for people who like humungeos fire fights with friends, although this costs a little too much, i would say wait until steam summer sales or christmas.
2346	1	a	Love this game if you like the cross between turn based stratagy maps and real time combat and tactics this is a must to own!
3772	1	a	Step 1: Get This Game Step 2: Get all the DLCs Step 3: Install DarthMod Step 4: Enjoy!  10/10 Would counquer India again with Poland  
1860	1	a	Maybe, the one of the best strategy and same time fun game!
3821	1	a	Fun stratagy game where you can rewrite history.  Experienced few bugs dispite being on a mac.
561	1	a	Gotta love mass genocide! Set the language to German to get the full experience.
3433	1	a	One of the best games I've ever played!
4680	1	a	Very good game, I do wish that it would have been continued to be updated but I do hope that #2 will be even better with the hope of multyplayer. I have played with a few mods and it has seemed to have halted but who knows. Maybe there will be some kind of boost to this game once again.
1857	1	a	Despite its age Empire is one of the best total war games ever  10/10
2959	1	a	Awesome game with tons of replay value :)
2329	1	a	You can command thousands of troops on the field to defend the country or dominate the world; the Americas, Europe, and India. Buy it then get out and fight!  Look at my total hours. Many people don't know how fun total war is...  Gameplay 10/10 Graphics 9/10 Controls 8/10 Storyline 9/10 Bug-Free 7/10 Replayability 10/10 Level of Challenge 10/10
116	1	a	It was alright
2680	0	a	This game has memory issues! It's a great game, that I love playing, but it does crash often. The game uses way too much memory for the game engine it was made with, and it was made to run on a 32 bit operating system. It does not have the ability to use all the hardware that you may have available for your games to use, and so it has many issues with crashing. Great game, but the crashes make you want to never buy a game from Sega again. Hard to keep playing a game after you spend over 50 hours on a map, just to have it crash, and never be able to finish.
2519	1	a	Don't believe the bad press. This game is awesome!!
5266	1	a	A GREAT Game!   - A lot of ships and configs.  - Immersive history. - Funny zombies.  - A lot of missons.    I played since 2012, Never boring. I'm excited to continue in SPAZ 2.     Thank you Producers.
3673	1	a	It might not be as clean or polished as Rome: Total War or Medieval 2: Total War, but Empire: Total War is nonetheless a pretty fun game. The campaign map is expansive, the playable factions are unique in their own ways and lend themselves to different strategies, and there's plenty of replay value. I have a couple of gripes with this game, some of which do affect gameplay. Firstly, the enemy AI can be quite dumb at times, even on higher difficulty settings, so the DarthMod add-on is absolutely necessary if you want to play a more challenging campaign. Secondly, the battle map designs are a little too bland for my tastes. I absolutely loved the beautiful and varied map designs in Medieval 2, so Empire felt a little bit like a step back for me in this regard. Lastly, the Road to Independence, a special four-part tutorial campaign, felt pretty stale and overly-scripted until I reached the fourth part, which actually allows you to experience the Grand Campaign in all its glory as the newly-formed United States. Despite these flaws, I generally enjoyed this Total War installment and would recommend it to any strategy gamer. Be sure to patch your game and install DarthMod for the best gameplay experience.
784	1	a	I'm hooked on this game. It has the right blend of puzzle solving and shooter gameplay to keep me coming back for more. There are variable solutions (aka trap combinations) to deal with the endless orcs, gnolls, kobolds and hellbats which keeps me coming back trying to get that last elusive skull. The main character apprentice war-mage is great; it's like Charlie Sheen playing Harry Potter (he even says 'Winning' in the game). The difficulty curve does get steep about 3/4 of the way through the game, where it starts to feel impossible to get perfection on a level. Would be cool if there was some form of co-op multiplayer on this, but I'm hopeful that this game will have DLCs in the future to include new traps, levels, player-characters.
1046	1	a	I, for one, do not condone the genocide of these orcian refugees, but these radical orc terrorists keep trying to cross into our land! We can't have that, now can we?
959	1	a	This is such a great tower defense game. The only thing that is missing is multiplayer, it's well worth the price if you like tower defense / 3rd person defense.
4409	1	a	Best played with Darthmod. Completely new game almost comparable with Napoleon total war
2847	1	a	very good I like to watch them touch each other with their big long and penetrative bayonets 111
2695	1	a	11/10 would make polish empire again
2628	1	a	one of the best total war games out there
2480	1	a	Kind of like civilisations, but when two armies meet you have the option of personally fighting the battle in a top down 'Age of Empires' manner. Long games on each map, but very tactical.
2464	1	a	It's real time and turn based strategy at it's finest. You can fight the Russians in Europe, the Mughal Emire in Indian, and the Native Americans in...I can't right remember. A great buy for history buffs or Total War fans. But the best part is Road to Independence which shows the rise of........'merica!!!
2702	1	a	One of my favorite games on steam
3672	1	a	Empire: Total War is probably my favorite game ever. You can play as many different countries with unique units and strategies. The research is worth doing and can be improved to give your country an edge. The maps are huge and you can play a large portion of the world (the provinces are huge though) which requires protecting trade routes and forging alliances. Overall great game with no bugs that I have ever seen.
1574	1	a	Download the DarthMod and be happy :)
2215	1	a	0/10 for Empire Total War, 10/10 for DarthMod Empire. Get the mod or you're not playing the real game.
322	1	a	This is a good game to kill time with. Classic tower defense type of game.
2402	1	a	I really like this game. It's fun, smart and civilized. Beautiful music plays while you plan to take over the world; what could be more relaxing? The naval battles are the best part; they alone justify whatever you pay. And you might learn a few things about history, and blowing stuff up.
340	1	a	Orcs Must Die! is a hell'o'va game. Its fun and frustrating, easy and challenging, you kick its â¥â¥â¥ or it will kick your â¥â¥â¥.   I totally recommend this game.
3153	1	a	best strategic real time strategy in the WORLD!
3843	1	a	With all of the patches this game has recived since it's original launch, this is actually a pretty good game. Playable, if not amazing graphics wise, the UI isn't impossible to understand and the tutorial is detailed enough to get you started and know how to play the game. Considering Rome II's current state, I recommend Empire over Rome II at the moment. Give it a little while and it should be on par with Empire, probably after Attila comes out
5297	1	a	This is stupid. And yet, I have played a whole bunch of it. It filled a niche in the games market that I never really had something for. There are a lot of top down space shooters with ships and whatnot, but really, I've only played flash games in that category. I loved them immensely, so when I had a chance to pick this up, I said, why not? I still recall the first day I played it, I got into it a bit, then got dragged down to the pool by my little sister, then a thunderstorm started up, and I came back home and kept playing. How many games can you recall specifically the day you started playing?
5106	1	a	Fun for the right price. more content and ships make this more fun.
3428	1	a	This game is a step up from previous games in the series due to the naval battles, the new entrenchment features units have, and worldwide domination. It's a great game.
4926	1	a	It's a quirky top-down space shooter (Dude, retro! Love it!). I hear there will be zombies that seem to be described similarly to Reavers from Firefly. I don't know and I don't care. All I know is I get to blow â¥â¥â¥â¥ up and make weird little ships... which I get the schematics for by blowing up other people and taking their stuff!  Totally worth it. :D
191	1	a	This game is AWESOMENESS
3606	1	a	This game is endless! You gonna need a couple of months to try everything. The ground fights are awesome, but why i love this game is for sea fights! You can find here the best sea fights ever. So i propose to get this game for those who like sea fights and for all fans of total war.
4333	1	a	10/10 game for me. best total war i've played
535	1	a	Orcs Must Die!   That's a pretty dumb name.   Although I ended spending way too much time on this silly little game. Orcs Must Die would fall in the 'Tower Defense' Genre but it has so many different twists. Firstly being, there's a pretty funny story and hilarious characters. You not only make traps, you also run around with a sword or gun or frost magic and fight as well. It's entirely possible to win the game without a single trap. It's also entirely possible to win without a single sword swing but both would be incredible difficult. I loved wasting time on this game.
2788	1	a	I'm playing as France and I decided to take over Savoy (because who cares about Savoy?) after taking them over Genoa got butthurt for some reason and attacked they tried to get my friend italian States to go to war with me but they said no. Few turns later Italian states just changed their mind and attacked so there goes our 'very friendly' relations. A turn after that the Brits declared war. My relations werent great with the British but what reasons could they have to go to war? I was allied with Spain and Sweden (two very powerful and wealthy nations) and they had no help. Some interesting Ai decisions hurts the value of the game but overall I've spent hours enjoying the game and would recommend it. Battles are fun if you are a solid tactician you should be able to win even if you are outnumbered.
822	1	a	this feels like a Disney cartoon gone horribly wrong. which is a good thing. probably the most fun I had with an action game all year.
4019	1	a	i have played this game a little and i like it
4057	1	a	Best total war game ever. Very much detailed gamelay. Diplomatic Relations, wars and govenrence systems are very well prepared. 10/10
4965	1	a	This is an excellent game. I totally recomend it.
2520	1	a	One of the best strategy games ever.
668	1	a	I took a chance buying this game and i'm glad i did, It's fun and addictive, The beauty of this game is that theres no specific way to set up the traps, Set them up your way, The joy of watching your perfectly arranged traps mowing down hordes of Orcs like a well oiled machine is wonderful to behold, With good graphics, sound and humor, I totally recommend this game, you'll almost feel sorry for the Orcs, Almost.
5327	1	a	Arma 3 has taught me that 10 FPS is playable.
529	1	a	Fun. Addicting. Fun achievements and significant skill level changes increase replay value.
1650	1	a	this game if for those player who like empire building over combat. if you wnat a blance of combat and empire building get medival 2 or if yoour want total war style combat get rome. this game is heavily influenced by policy and empire managing. a major new featuresthe best diplonacy system eve rmade for a total war, towns have been introducted to effect your reigions as they grow and what you can build, technolligy is now controllable instead of a fixed time date and naval battles are in play. this and the last 2 major titles are wha tmake shogun 2 and shogun fall of the samurai the most balanced games in the series. because i havent actually played shogun i can't review it yet.
3479	1	a	awsome game fun gamplay very addictive. 
118	1	a	Most fun I have had in a while. Consistant gameplay with little twists.
4662	1	a	Over all, this is one of my favorite games on steam. I was very surprised to see how much fun it all would be and I totally recommend giving it a try and if it goes on sell, you likely can't go wrong picking up a copy.  S.P.A.Z. reminds me a whole lot of one of my fav games of all time, EscapeVelocity. I remember playing EV on our Mac years and years ago. It left such a good impression that I watched the companies website like a hawk for almost a decade for signs of windows development, and promptly bought a copy.  There isn't any market trading in SPAZ, it's all about the combat and ship upgrades. And it's incredibly satisfying to finally unlock that next high capacity ship and beef up your little squadron and go tearing through hostile territories. I was delaying what I thought would complete the game, and then I finally went forward with the quest and realized that a whole new world of gameplay opens up toward the end of the game. It feels a little more tedious than the rest of the game, but still something I will go back and play quite often it was so much fun. The visuals are great, simple sprites unleashing very pretty particles of destruction all in front of really beautiful galactical backdrops. The music is more ambient and moody than pulse pumping 'ReallyBigSky' type stuff but it fits the situation very well.  There were a few mechanics that are sticking points because of how vaguely they're explained (if at all) and I played a great deal of the game blindly before I realized that mousing over systems would show me the info I wanted to know about them in a popup window (what type of exchange I can do there, and how much of that exchange I can do) without having to warp to each and every system and just trial-and-error it all out. So a word to the wise, watch those popup highlights change, they contain lots of time-saving info.
638	1	a	It's like tower defense meets action RPG. Orcs Must Die! is quite fun.
1420	1	a	This is the best 18th century musket line warfare simulator. horrible launch but is great now with all the patches. Launch score would be 6.5/10 but now a 8/10.  Pros:  12 Great Campagins  Great Tech tree that improves your base units while unlocking unique versions of units  alot of units variety from irish brigade to east company infantry and much much more  Battles are great if your into the time period (may not be your favorite if your not really into the time period)  Big campagin map  Units types stand out like lancers are clearly different from hussars, elite infantry are clearly better then regluars ect.  Campagin that is not too complicated  very good tutorial campagin with road to independence  Great time period        Cons:  a few bugs and annyoing crash here and there nothing game breaking (most can be easily avoided)  AI is not too good  The multiplayer was ruined by a bunch of Call of Duty type trash players  Arillery and cavalry needs to be mirco managed for them to work properly  No multiplayer campagin  extremly overpowered light dragoons
2496	1	a	A bit buggy in animations at times, but I find it really strategic, and it gets me to actually think. Multiplayer is even more fun, but saddly this game is not very popular.
1024	1	a	Tons of Orcs, tons of fun, plays like dream â get this one!
2559	1	a	I've spent so many hours on this game. The campaign mode is super addictive(addicting?). The battles are amazing, as well. Strategy works in this game. Flanking is my main means of victory, rout the enemy like no other. It's an amazing game, tons of mods that I don't know how to use, and even playing with friends is fun.
2891	1	a	The naval battles are quite fun and the commanding of the British during their heyday is awesome. I like it!
2091	1	a	testicles. that is all.
3420	1	a	Recommended, not only because the game is a very good RTS title, but mostly because I enjoy being the Iroquois settlers and exacting revenge on the American and British soldiers. Karma, you â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s.
3239	1	a	Still the best in the Total War series.
1936	1	a	one of the better total war games but not the best
2172	0	a	I played 66 hours of this game and I highly don't recommend this game. This game has issues like crashes, bugs, and dumb A.I. The game, I believe, is an open beta game where the graphics are crap and lags for no reason(I have a very good computer that can run game on high graphics). If you really want to buy this game I highly recommend on buying total war shogun 2 where as the game is a lot more stable and has extremely less bugs and crashes. Also, buy this game on a deal so you don't have to regret on spending 20 dollars.   update: i forgot to mention after 7 years of this game's release, IT'S STILL BROKEN.
3230	1	a	Great game perfect balance of turn based and real time strategy, im actually new to the total war games and i have been addicted to this game. If your a history guy like like me then you will like it even more the politics of the age are very accurate, how diplomacy was conducted how etc. I reccomend this game to any history guy or gal of course and i also reccomend this game to huge time strategy fan.
1696	1	a	It's really good game!
5241	1	a	I love this game and I hope the sequel is coming out soon.
3060	1	a	a very in depth game for ppl with brains and patience...and a lot of time lol!
4905	1	a	really great space fighting game with a good story
978	1	a	Awesome game for any and all pc gamers.
2232	1	a	Its good game however the industrial age never really clicked with me. Still a good game to play in your past time.
3634	1	a	This game is racist
5215	1	a	A nice top-down shoot-em-up. Despite the title, it's really a lot more Space Pirate, and a lot less zombies. Until the second half of the game - where there is too much zombies.  Progression is just slightly grindy, but each time you get an upgrade you want it makes the wait worthwhile.  Before entering the final zone it's best to fully upgrade and at least have one full huge spaceship. There won't be places to farm Rez for recovery if you're too weak in the final zone.  Overall a great way to kill time. And space.
3411	1	a	Amazing! Only wish it had better demomatic options.
375	1	a	I have to recommend this just based on the hilarious dance animations the main character does after clearing a stage. Great tower defense game.
1354	1	a	-plays Poland-Lithuania -trades for most regions in east Europe -spreads religion -religion causes war with Russia,Austria, and Martha confederacy...wut -fights Austria first, Russia backstabs, and Martha confederacy cheers them on -Turks declare war on all of them -so does Sweden -England decides to fight France, drawing in Spain and Austria -huge pressure relieved -wins the 40 year war -Poland-Lithuania has east Europe -steamrolls Prussia, Italian states, France,Turkey,Sweden,Denmark, and Spain -Great Britain is left -declares war -annihilate London and York -wins game before total destruction of Europe      11/10 would become world conqueror again
3301	1	a	i like to make gigantic armies to shoot people
3628	1	a	One of the best Total War games in my mind! 
4884	1	a	Surprisingly much more fun than I had anticipated. The controls need a major revamp, it would do much better as a twin stick shooter, but it's still pretty awesome... Surprised that they made it with Torque, even more surprised at the performance (knowing it was made with torque)
1209	1	a	Disicples III: Reincarnation is surely the best version of Disciples III (i mean there was 'Ressurection', that was really bugged to death and some other version if I remember correctly, that was also very buggy), not nearly as good as Disciples II, but still a good game, with a great story - and that's what I love the most about games. At least they fixed most of the bugs that I've had troubles with in earlier versions. The gameplay, on the other hand, still isn't very good, while playing a campaign the world feels too static, AI level is pretty low, you basically can predict all the moves, that AI is going to make once you've gotten deeper into the game. This game could've been a lot better, but if you are into RTS games and you are looking for something to try out, you definetly should check out this one.  7/10.  I'd still rather play Disciples II, though. :&gt;
1849	1	a	2600+ hours played 10/10 would fail freshmen year again
4741	1	a	Fantastic game for the money, highly recomended, the controls and concepts easy but the game isnt. a real challenge buy this when its on sale.
3916	1	a	10/10 Best Total war game ever !
1228	1	a	As everything else has already been said before, only one word from me to describe this game:  B-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-M ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !  (And as 'Firepower' *hinthint* does still matter: ... Remember to turn the volume UP! ... :)
594	1	a	Quirky, easy to play, fun for anyone tower defense game. KILL THEM ORCS!
5083	1	a	Yeah, it's allright I guess. It's not fantastic. It fills some time. I wish there were more factions. I wish the ship upgrades felt more special, like I had really worked my tail to get them instead of just being friends with some guys on a space station. I guess that would be helped by more factions really.
3854	1	a	I'm actually surprised to see that I've sunk 51 hours into this game. That's not to say I didn't enjoy it - I did, and I'm giving the game a thumbs up because of that - but it didn't quite capture me as much as the previous Total War games did. I think some of this is personal preference, in that I'm just not as interested in this era of history. But I also think the game became unnecessarily complicated in its mechanics, and for some reason I never quite 'got' the combat like I did in the more traditional swords and shields combat of the previous games. I haven't played Napoleon, but I'm reliably informed that it's basically a better version of Empire, so if you're looking for a Total War game with muskets and bright uniforms, you should probably buy that instead.
4720	1	a	Wait for it to go on sale. It is a realy good game, just don't pay full price. 
5283	1	a	Great game to kill some time, but gets repetitive after a while.
1293	1	a	Used American Indians to conquer India: 10/10
502	1	a	At first glance of hearing a third person tower defense threw me of, made it think it wasnt worth my time, as soon as i bought due to the sale i know its worth the full price itself. the total destruction of orcs is amazing.
157	1	a	Orkmobslashing headshotspreading corpsestomping greenskinshredding gnollstunning fun. Seriously. Try the demo, if you don't believe my supreme Opinion of supremeness, which is supreme.... by superiority! ;D
1236	1	a	Great game. I've been playing these games on iOS for a long time asnd the deskyop version is judt as much, and just as challenging as you want it to be.
90	1	a	Got to love this game. Tower defense, FPS, Story progression, hilarious... This game has it all. This is a great goto game when you have a few mins to kill.
2983	1	a	one of the best i think!
1609	1	a	Mother Russia doesn't want peace with me :(
3238	1	a	in my opinion the most elaborated strategical pc game ever made, very addictive and full of historical moments. 9.5/10
1391	1	a	You can have America take over Europe and India, or prevent America from existing.
3921	1	a	it is just simply amazing
3144	1	a	Great game, ive heard that the newer games are bad but i played this and it was good. From what i know about 1700's/1800's history it seems historically acurate. YOu can see each unit reloading (with the exception of the rocket platform which does nothing for a long time and then reloads one rocket which turns into 6) but they seem to miss the barrels with the ram rods. just one more minor annoying thing, is that infantry inorder to fire, everyone i mean everyone has to be reloaded unless it is light infantry, which seems to be less trained but longer ranged. The naval is fun though a bit harder than the land. Sometimes the ai is a bit weird but i dont see many problems with it, also cut this game some slac it came out 5-6 years ago, technoloy has come a long way. Now ive said alot of bad things 'what about the good' well its strategy is fun, it has formations, different ammo types for artillery, bayonet charges look awesome, it is highlarious when you charge right into enemies and they fly back like 10 feet it is highlarious and fun to watch. The game seems well balanced and if a country has less units those units willl be a bit more powerful and more powerful units will be expensive. but i cant give you a good idea on the grand campaign i havnt played it much because i perfer the real time battles but it is a great game for the price so enjoy!
3551	1	a	Total War series what can I say? Actually was part of a test group when this game was being developed in SF so it was neat to be exposed to art work and game mechanics before the release. Great turn based game. Wish I had more time to thoroughly enjoy all the factions/story lines.
1578	1	a	it is a very fun game if u ask me. i have not had it for very long but when i got it i have just still all day playing it.
1913	1	a	Great game!
2539	1	a	Do I need to say anything?
3946	1	a	THIS GAME DOWNLOADED IN SPANISH? WTF I CANNOT READ ANYTHING RRR YOU STEAM!!....
2621	1	a	dispite the claims empire tw is a 'Broken game' i think it is quite the opposite and i have lost many hours to its funfactor emersed in colonial europe with ym glorious englishmen gunning down thoses american peasant rebles anyway bacl too the review the game plays well ive seen no bugs batlles last a good time not short and often slugging to the last man i love grity tw and ai is fairly agressive but no match for me even on the highest diffuclty but it lacks ib mp as it has no coop which it would be sensational too have overall i give it 8/10
