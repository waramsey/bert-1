1	1	a	Now here is a MOBA game that never got the credit it deserved. Demigod popped on my radar a few years back but when it launched there were several server issues that hindered the initial launch. I still praise this game because when the dust settled and the mud slinging stopped it turned out to be a pretty little gem.   Demigod borrows interesting ideas from RTS games and implements that into MOBA gameplay. Capturing points, upgrading troops, towers and buildings are just a few of these mechanics and I welcome them as a different way of looking at how MOBA games could add layers of gameplay. Unfortunately there was nothing else added to the game with the exception of two extra demigods. Each demigod is unique and you still level up, gain gold, upgrade skills and buy items.  I've had some incredible matches on Demigod when the community remained active and it is something I always go back to with a few friends for bot matches. The AI matches can get incredibly hectic on the higher difficulties with Demigod offering a variety of maps. You can pick up Demigod now for $10 but I've seen it for around $5 on the sales.  
1	0	a	Garbage cash grab, with a hit and miss registration. Good chance your one won't work day one like mine didn't.   Went to support to ask them to sort it out, they firstly seemed like they were trying to be helpful, then they tried to claim I didn't own the steam version, after sending them a screenshot of it in my library for proof the idiot in support somehow thought I had fixed the issue and closed my support ticket, I reopened it and questioned how they came to the conclusion that it was fixed. No response.   Avoid this company.
3	1	a	Best MOBA I've seen so far. It's got everything and actually requires you to think your next move and also empowers you as player to contribute to victory other than 'win teamfight -&gt; game over' base destroyed before enemy respawns back. Some players in your team can push lanes, others can capture towers, others can upgrade your own towers or units or citadel or even spawn multiple types of minions/archers/balistas/angels/giants etc. You could go capture some mines or that all round wanted +20% Experience Flag or the infamous +15% HP and EVEN upgrade yourself with multiple spawn-able units that you directly control yourself and that can be purchased from the shop. There's a lot of diversity in maps as there are many of them and unlike other mobas this one actually has mods! You know things that upgrade your UI, bot AI, Extra items etc.  I'm having a blast playing this game and would recommend it to anyone who likes MOBA games because it is unique in this genre.
5	1	a	This game is really well designed and has very high production values. All around a well polished game with great graphics and soundtrack. For instance, the opening movie sequence was voiced by the actor, Christopher Lee, known for his roles as Dracula and the evil wizard, Sauron, in Lord of the Rings.  The initial learning curve is a little steep without strong tutorial missions, but persistent players will be rewarded with hours of fun. I recommend playing against the computer bots on easy mode, and if possible, get a friend to play co-op with you against the bots. You won't be disappointed.  Demigod is something of a sleeper hit that may have been overshadowed by the likes of League of Legends (LOL) and Defense of the Ancients (DOTA 1 and DOTA 2). However, this game is just so cool when you have a friend to play with.  Keg gives Demigod four thumbs up!
7	1	a	Demigod is one of those games which surprised the hell out of me in many ways. From the overall presentation, the graphics and audio and the very fun and addictive gameplay, Demigod is one of the best mixed genre games and a shining example of how great game developers can continue to evolve old ideas into bigger and better games. For players looking for some challenging strategy with an RPG skill system that allows the player to tailor the game to their play style, will find a fun and affordable game with Demigod.Demigod is one of those games which are focused for a restricted community. The game is strategy, but it’s also a role-playing and an action game, and every genre it tries its well executed, offering a deep and engaging on-line gameplay. Not traditional at all, and surprisingly intense.Just make sure you understand what kind of game you are buying and you won't be disappointed.
9	1	a	This is probabley the most underrated moba ever it is great
11	1	a	Great game, highly unfortunate it's too dead for playing online matches. Apparently never had much of a matchmaking system, either. However, the single player is still a lot of fun and I highly recommend picking it up.
2	0	a	Stupid registration system, can't get it to work.
13	1	a	Short version: If you have ANY desire to play a MOBA that was ahead of its time. Get this.   Long-ish textwally version: This game was the BEST way back in the day when there was a somewhat lively community, it's died down quite a lot since, but still decent. The gameplay was, and to me, still is, slightly is ahead of the MOBA curve in it's own way, such as being able to upgrade your main citadel to buff your creep waves and the like. Now due to it's age, theres many a bug, my personal favorite being random times where your character won't bloody move when told, but that's pretty minor and rare.  Another thing I love is the fact that, while certain God's are more suited to certain roles, there is no 'Best' build for every situation for a given character. Speaking of God's, quite a bit of diversity, you've got anywhere from the fragile archer angel, Regulus, to the literal walking castle Rook. The gods are split into two types: Assassins and General's, Assassins just worry about themselves, whereas General are capable of summoning various creatures, either through abilities or items. While there are admittedly only 10 gods, and all there ever will be as far as we can tell, well, outside of mods of course, but they all have a huge amount of thought and love put into their designs and back story.  There are about 8 maps, and 4 modes, so it may repeat a bit... In hindsight I realize this was just me gushing over the game, but still, if that doesn't make you interested, dunno what will, 9.5/10
15	1	a	I love this game. I eternally love, love.. LOVE this game.  I can replay it over and over and over again, as if I'm searching for something new but never find it. Which brings me to why I hate this game. I hate this game so much for making me want more of this game.  Fantastic artwork, a storyline that you can pretty much sense just through some of the battle dialogue, the ability to constantly adjust the camera angles because I forget what game I'm playing and think that I'm strafing- instead, I disorient myself and forget where I am. I know that there are newer, updated games out there, and I know it had a rough start, but it's one of those simple games you can keep going back to with your friends or do some tournaments on your own and pretend that you have friends. (Clearly, I choose to do the latter.)  .. I really need friends. So I can buy them the 4-pack and make them pretend to be my pixelated friends.  (I love this game.)
17	1	a	There are a lot of negative reviews on here. Which is to bad, because it is a well done game. Most of the complaints are mainly due to the non-support of PvP. If you want the LOL experience this is not your game, but if you want a single player game that you can custimize each skirmish / tournament then this is a fantastic find.
19	1	a	Excellent, I know it suffered from a poor launch, but well worth a go
21	1	a	Oldie but goldie and still a must-have for LAN parties!
23	1	a	&gt;Sees reviews about planning and strategy &gt;Makes team of nothing but 5 Rooks &gt;Enemies don't really notice or care &gt;So began the Legged Castles gang &gt;Never lost a game &gt;There is no strategy &gt;There is only Legged Castles So yeah, pretty great MOBA, definitely would recommend for any strategy fan.
25	1	a	For moba fans, this game is worth trying when in promo...  It was supposed to be 1 of the most played games today, if it werent for the servers when it launched....  the game offers interesting maps, awesome customization unseen in most moba games and good modes...  i would have definetly played this game constantly instead of many others out there, if they had invested more on servers....
27	1	a	Good moba game here. Not as difficult to pick up as Dota. The multiplayer suffers sometimes extreme lag due to coding issues. But a solid game either way.
29	1	a	For those gamers who don't want to play PVP for what ever the reasons, but likes this type of game with Co-op VS AI... Demigod is the game for you. I wish stardock would make more maps, but for a few bucks, this game is worth thanks to the community creating such great mod packs like the enhanched AI and UI.
31	1	a	Totally underrated and under supported by both gamers and the developers. Lots of fun just little variety. When on sale go for the 4 pack!
33	1	a	An underappreciated gem. Very fun to play with your friends.
35	1	a	Demigod is a really enjoyable game. Like real time RPG chess. You can find mods online, the one I recommend highly is a bug fix mod called 'Uberfix', It's well worth the price of $9,99
37	1	a	great game.well worth the money!!!
39	1	a	Dont pay any attention to the number of hours I have played it on steam. I have owned this game from the first time it came out. And I have hundreds of hours on this game.  This is one game that does not get the respect it deserves. It is a complicated MOBA and it requires you to think on how your strategy is to be played out. And it is not as fast as games like DOTA2, so it gives you a little time to think (not much though). It is not a MOBA like Dota games. In this game you do not destroy towers, except for the citadel which will end the game. In Demigod you control flags and each flag has different buffs and the control of the object they are near. (I.E. Portals,) When you control a flag that is next to a portal you team gets that portal and the minions that come out of that portal belong to your team as long as you control the flag. Plus there are character upgrades and Citadel upgrades and you can buy artifacts from the store or a special store that requires the capture of a flag. Also there are artifact upgrades that you can purchase with Favor points that stay with you from game to game. And the characters have a lot of spells that completely identify to their character type. Pretty much everyone agrees that the graphics and animation is stunning, and they are. And for a 2009 game they hold up to any game. And the strategy is deep and you will learn to hate your friends all over again. This game is brutal and non-forgiving. The main complaints from people are 1. No tutorial. And it doesn’t. This was a bad mistake by GPG. The game does have a strong learning curve. This causes people not to understand the game, and go on to something else. 2. The internet lobby is bad. And it is. The Internet Lobby is limited. But my friends mostly play among ourselves. It works over internet and Local LAN Hosting.   For me it is good to have a MOBA that is not like DOTA, Not that I have complaints about DOTA and I also play DOTA2, but there are just so many DOTA like games out there. And most of them seem to have the same map, and the interfaces seem to close to the same. If not an outright copy.
41	1	a	Not exactly like the mainstream mobas , mainly because of your direct involvement in your tem's victory. I would give this one a 7/10 , mainly because of lack of items. You can make a truly unique hero despite of a small roster , and contribute in your team's victory in various ways. That being said , items sadly lack diversity , and you will find yourself reapeating one and the same build throughout the game. About the actual gameplay , as said before , you contribute to your team's victory in more than one way , capturing checkpoints to spawn additional minions , or instead of investing gold on yourself , you can invest it in upgrades for your own team , from purchasing smaller death penalties to upgrading minions , and a lot more. To summarize , although it is truly fun for a while , it eventualy bores out , since there isnt enough replayable content.
43	1	a	Great Moba! You get to pick about8 to 10 charcters each with their own play styles. Best thing is that you can play alone or with friends or others online...if there is anyone online to play with. Highly recommended .
45	1	a	Amazing game, however it hasn't had updates in a while and a few friends have noticed memory leak issues on a couple different machine setups.  Unfortunately until purchased there is no way for certain to know if you'll have this issue.
47	1	a	This game is a great mix of RTS, MOBA, and RPG style gaming. Very addicting and worth the price.
49	1	a	I've had this game in my library for some months now... But just recently started playing it. I did not expect this game to be that good! This is like a slower, but more strategy demanding game than more modern MOBA titles. You basically have to maintain control over certain points of interest to win the game.   Haven't played singleplayer modes.   POSITIVE: - Beautiful Design of characters and maps.  - Versatile gameplay styles depending on the map and Demigod you have chosen to play.  - Its a ton of fun for playing between friends.   NEGATIVE:  - Lack of online community.  - No tutorial.  - The Game crashed the first time I ran it on W10. But after a simple restart, the game functioned normally. I would expect more of these errors occur, but nothing too serious.   Note: Multiplayer skirmish games can last over an hour.   I recommend buying this game with a bunch of friends.
51	1	a	very fun game to play unfotunitaly no one plays it any more from what I can see. alot like DOta and League of legends.
53	1	a	Dead sadly. Old but good. One of the first 'MOBAS'.
55	1	a	Top down tower defense game with unique map layout. Very basic tower defense game (TDG) that has single player 'skirmish' and multiplayer modes, from 1 vs. 1 to 5 vs. 5 players.  It feels like it wasn't meant to be a full online / multiplayer experience like other TD games. Game didn't get popular enough to compete with League of Legends, Heroes of Newearth and other tower defense games. Has unique maps, not your average 'creeps run in line to enemy base' layout. Limited number of 'Heroes', your basic melee and ranged types, nukers, tanks and supports.  Character design is good with great abilities, animation, model quality and textures. Environment quality is really basic, not a lot of detail, mostly stone, concrete grey surfaces, with magic and arrow towers. Maps are located in 'space', looks like you're battling in 'divine heights' after all. There are different places on maps that you can capture, some add gold income, some increase creep health and damage, others boost your health / mana regeneration, etc.  You can buy items for head, chest, belt, boots, gloves, accessory slots as well as buy special 'Hero summonable creeps' - ranged, melee and healer types, that you can control and resummon if killed through the match. Killing creeps, enemy heroes and capturing objectives on map grant you experience, thus you level up. Maximum level is 20, and each time you level you can spend points to upgrade your HERO '1234 aka QWER' abilities or upgrade the BASE skills (creep health, add unique creeps to waves, etc.).  Game doesn't feel like your typical TDG, and is somewhat unique. Downside is that not many people play multiplayer, and there's not much diversity to keep you going for long time. Game itself is a short and basic TD experience, that I personally enjoyed playing.
10	0	a	tryed to find a fix to the game not being able to load direct3d despite having done everything that according to 'support' should have worked updated my drivers to the best version re-installed the game verified the files made sure the things required to use 3D in games were active but looking online i always see that this issue is not resolved after about two years i think in the past about 2 and a half years ago i could play this game with no problems then i left it alone for a while and this is what i come back to great f****** game man amazing 10/10 pass me the bleach. EDIT IM GONNA TRY ONE LAST THING I FOUND THAT 'SUPPORT' SAID TO OTHER PEOPLE WITH THE SAME ISSUE A REBOOT.
11	0	a	Picked it up a while ago, havent played in ages, and now Im unable to play again thanks to the botched registration system that they have. Try at your own risk.
57	1	a	The MOBA movement is gain strength every day and this is one of the first great ones. Demigod is often overlooked but it a great game that bring a MOBA style to solo and LAN play, no internet connection required. Even better the DLC is such that you can use one copy and let everyone on the LAN play together.
59	1	a	Great if friends own
61	1	a	Excellent Moba, Unfortunately multiplayer is pretty much DEAD. Single player is still fun or if you can get a few friends it can be fun. There are a Total of 8 heroes all of which vairy in skills and play Styles.
63	1	a	Not as popular as DOTA, HoN, LoL but is better and more immersive than all three of them in terms of the levelling up and skills system. There are only 10 'heroes' to choose from, but each are as different as they can be. Stunning graphics, exciting gameplay and chaotic skirmishes make this game worth it even though sadly, no one really plays it anymore.
12	0	a	No one plays this anymore and the servers are all but shut down. It would be better if single player was any good but it is too easy. Don't waste your money.
65	1	a	This is the fith most awesome game ive ever played. But, i cant play as the two new demigods. If you know how to get it working reply. if theres any cheats reply what they are.
13	0	a	A true shame here. I bought this on Stardock's dead Impulse client and they were kind enough to send me steam keys for this and my other games. This game is worthless without an online community, which has been nonexistant for many years. Never a single player online. This is a perfect case of what lack of promotion will lead to. This is one of the best DOTA clones in my opinion. It brought new ideas, is very pretty, sounds fantastic. Great production all around. It deserved better success. But as of now, it should not be purchased. I expect Sins of a Solar Empire will have a similar review from me...
14	0	a	Always downvote 3rd party EULA, even if the game play is ok.
67	1	a	One of the most underrated MOBA, this game is better than any LoL or DotA ripoff. It was actually released before those two and really pushed the MOBA genre. It's sad that it didn't get as many attention as it shoudlve had, leading to the an early abandonment of the game by the devs. I got to say though that even with only 10 heroes, this game feel fresh and very diversed. Needless to say that this is the best looking MOBA, even after all those years.   I'd recommend this game to anyone who want to take a little break from the big two (LoL and DotA2). It's worth the money!
69	1	a	Polished but uninspired DOTA clone. I've played custom maps in WC3 that's way more fun than this.
15	0	a	I thought that this was a MOBA, not a make a stardock account then figure it out from there simulator. If you havn't bought this game yet, don't buy it. Unless they update it and remove that stupid feature.
71	1	a	I love this game. Too bad they discontinued it :(
73	1	a	this game is super sweet
16	0	a	This is the game you instantly regret buying, as you'll try it only once. Then you'll end up never playing it and it just sits there gathering dust in your library.
17	0	a	There is no campaign, no story and multiplayer is dead.
18	0	a	This game worked for my 7 hours that i did play.... back in 2011 when i got it. I just recently tried to get back on. Stardock removed my account. And wasted my product key... Fu.ck it. I paid for the product I cant use. Guess Ill pirate a copy since I legally own the game.   This game would have been great to play on my older computer, but of course yet again another reason why DRM needs to go away on steam. Steam is the DRM not your ♥♥♥♥♥ty website solutions. Let this be a lesson to all gaming companies to leave the silly cun.t shi.t to the professionals. No one wants your DRM.
19	0	a	Don't buy it! No updates and no support.  I feel abandoned with this game. It had potential. I played this before I played LoL, and this was badass. It was FUN! I was really hoping for some kind of update for this game, I got it when it came out. Nothing. So, a game that could have been great sits, and rots. Sucks, Big Time!
20	0	a	It removes one of the worst conventions of MOBAs, last-hitting, but provides such a bare-bones experience that it will only entertain you for a short time before you've seen all there is to see. Worse still, Stardock has labeled the project a failure, and there will be no more work done on the game. If you want to play a MOBA, but you hate last-hitting, try Heroes of the Storm. I hear it is more of a Hero brawler, and less of a MOBA, but it is probably a better use of your money.  I'll admit I enjoyed the game, when I still felt motivated to play it, and I got it for a whole $2, so I suppose I got a good value. However, I also got Sacred Gold (on  gog.com , mind) for the same price, and will continue to get value out of that that will far exceed this title, just to put things in perspective.
75	1	a	2009 (early): 'This game borrows so much from DotA!'  2016: League of Legends, Dota 2, Heroes of the Storm, Smite, Prime World, Guardians of the Middle-Earth, Infinite Crisis, do I go on?
77	1	a	Good game. No one plays multiplayer, but if you get it and you're on my friends list definitely message me to play.
79	1	a	Great game to play with friends! Amazing strategy. Ignore the bad reviews, everything in this game works just fine, including online play.
81	1	a	I remember this back when it first came out, was supposed to be a 'League of Legends' killer  Unfortunatly they didnt realize how insanly popular LoL would become, thus totally dwarfing this game completly and throwing it into the corner of obscurity.  This game was Gifted to me by a friend and I have to say its a fun game for that style of gameplay.   This game however lacks characters... there are only two types... Tank/Healers and Assassin/Carry's. That is coupled with the fact there are only 8 choosable characters to play (+2 grey'ed out unchoosables... a DLC that didnt happen?) making gameplay a tad repetitive in the long run.  If you decide to pick this game up though be warned, there is no Online community for it anymore... pick it up knowing you will only be playing A.I. Bots solo  but for 2.50 (the sale price) its totally worth it as a great casual hour killing game. if you want to play this style of game Seriously though pick up League of Legends or DoTA2 (they are both free) they have huge communities and 'MLG' tournaments  7/10
83	1	a	Moba before LOL and DOTA 2. Community is active on game ranger :)
85	1	a	DOTA clone with poor graphics. Worth a try anyways.
87	1	a	Think of another League of Legends except its more realistic !!!!!
26	0	a	It's a cheap MOBA, not an 'action stratagy rpg' There are better ones out for free, don't bother.
89	1	a	A tragic MOBA that showed promise but flopped. Still really fun to play though, just lacks a wide selection of heros :/  6/10
91	1	a	If you love DOTA, LOL, or any of those arena style games you'll enjoy this one! I just wish that they'd make a sequel.
93	1	a	the game is awsome
95	1	a	This game is seriously one of the best MOBAs ever made except it was made in the wrong time period and did'nt catch on.Add me or find some people who wanna play and buy 4pack 8/10
36	0	a	Not a fan. picked it up for a dollor, and that is about what its worth.  Not really BAD but nothing that makes me want to come back for more.    5/10 for repedative DOTA would be
37	0	a	Not that great.
38	0	a	Stardock just added very restricking DRM to this game. Don't buy.
97	1	a	9/10
44	0	a	worst game i hav ever played
45	0	a	Its a MOBA. The game is dead. It is not bad Its just not good. theres no point in playing single player just play DOTA2, Leauge, Smite, HOTS everything else is a waste of time they all die.
46	0	a	The game lacks a couple of things. Way too few items. Very little info on how things work. No attack-move. No log of how you died.  It feels unfinished and empty.
47	0	a	Paid for this and it just crashes constantly. Not the best advert for a game.
48	0	a	Can't even play the game it freezes or stays on the loading screen.
49	0	a	Chris Taylor, you completely disappointed me with this game. NEGATIVE.
99	1	a	Pretty sexy game I usually have alot of fun smashing people out
101	1	a	+++
58	0	a	 The most confusing game of C&amp;C and StarCraft.  What the f*ck!? No instructions, no storyline...  1/10
59	0	a	:/
60	0	a	Waste of money..... Damn metacritic
61	0	a	This game, like so many others in the MOBA-'genre' (and no, I can't say that without being MASSIVELY sarcastic), is utter garbage. Rubbish. Worthless. You have a shïtty ten 'characters' to pick from, and you'd expect that with a roster that tiny, the few that're available will all feel completely unique and incredibly well-made, polished to a mirror sheen and then some! But guess what? NOPE! The so-called 'characters' are all bland and uninteresting, and there's absolutely zero balance between them.  Hell, there's absolutely zero balance in the game PERIOD! Now, I haven't played it for a while, so I can't know for sure, but last time I DID play it worked like this: earn a focking rëtardedly massive amount of gold, buy All-Father's Ring, win the game. Because buying a singular item REALLY should make so much difference to everything in the game that you LITERALLY become unstoppable, unkillable and automatically win. Honestly, I don't get why they wouldn't just make it so that whichever player gets that focking stupid amount of unspent gold 'earns' his/her team a victory auto-stupid-matically.  The game has so many glitches, balance issues and outrageously rëtarded design errors that it's just plain unplayable. Considering also that DOTA2 is now available, I will personally voodoo-curse anyone BUYING this game instead of playing DOTA2 FOR FREE. 0.7/10
62	0	a	Demigod has no single-player campaign. It's strictly multiplayer game. Not rcommended for single players.
63	0	a	too confusing, without a manual or a in-game tutorial it's basically impossible to find out how things work.
64	0	a	pls dont play this game
65	0	a	Unfortunatly I was quite dissappointed in this game. It has a really awesome look to it and have some decent opening story, however what has unimpressed me is the actual gameplay is like a single-player Dota2, but with a couple of changed. One being that you can summon your own minions to aid you, you can also upgrade your citadel so that the waves of spawn that attack the enemy's spawn get better armour, weapons and units to help give a tactical edge in a sense of Command and Conquer and researching technology, but spending gold to do that means you won't be able to buy items for yourself to equip at the shop.  You have capture points too and as I said this game is fun if you like the Dota2 style and it's got some unique characters and a compelling story, but it's a shame that there is no campaign mode because I would've loved that. The idea that the different worlds would end differently depending on the demigod you chose.  This game really isn't for me, I already have Dota2 and I'm not really a fan of that game either so unfortunatly I'm not going to spend anymore time on this game.
66	0	a	Boring game, so sad that the trailer shows amazing gameplay but in reality it's just another MOBA without a campaign.
67	0	a	Terrilble game, glad I only sent $2 on it.
68	0	a	Crap. MOBA with terrible controls, slow progression and woeful un-changeable controls.
69	0	a	I would like to give this game a great big black d1ck in the a$$. It is the worst game in the world. Aids is more fun. It Is second to cancer.
70	0	a	When I purchased this game I thought it was an action/strategy RPG, seeing as it had no gameplay videos and its genre is action, strategy, RPG; However it is NOT! This game does NOT 'blend action, strategy and role-playing elements into a thrilling new experience' as its description so claims! Demigod is just another ♥♥♥♥ DOTA/LoL clone. Its like SMITE if you were playing it from a top-down perspective instead of 3rd person! DO NOT SPEND ANY MONEY ON THIS GAME! Instead go play SMITE for free, its basically the same game but made as a third person shooter!   0/10 - Would ask for my money back if I thought stardock would actually give it back. Even the $4.99 i spend when it was on sale was not worth the price!
71	0	a	Not the best execution of a MOBA in my opinion. Viewpoint is weird, gameplay is choppy.
72	0	a	this game blows just play leauge of legends, it's free and better
73	0	a	This is a moba right, a moba with verry few avatars to play, devs that seemed to abandon it verry soon after its launch, a lobby that u have to log into, u cannot just get in &amp; start a game because no steam login token support... its like these dudes looked at LOL &amp; DOTA2 &amp; said dam those games are to good lets do a halfassed coppy &amp; try to sell it to the loosers out there in steam community they will buy anything....
74	0	a	Horrible.
103	1	a	demigod on the pc is a videogame featuring lacking vibration in multiplayer tattling less effort!  never sqaunders the facts,surprisingly unstated!No extravagant lifestyle,who can blame this piece!   a tabloid of inches cant reach to the star point of this casual experience! Kinda like the perks of fame but loses its gravity touches!  The game is not bad,its fun on the multiplayer side,different browsing options u can procede with as ur the powerhouse of all the abilities,and demigods!  aspiring to some,not really a mental breakdown! some musical skill sets and u can get the job done right withstand the other nit picks!  theirs no arguing its fanbase!ITs settled!Ageless,stunt loving u can enjoy this wonderful multiplayer piece but stay away from the single player experience,as u travel down to the sucky games list!   Very competitive as im the underdog going through all the classes,i give this game a 8.1/10 some guidance,but its a typically alright central game if u get what im saying here love the burrito master
105	1	a	Demigod is just awesome, and although small in scale, a great option for fans of DoTA-style games. Select from 10 different heroes (Assassins [specialise in taking out enemy heroes] and Generals [specialise in supporting friendly forces and commanding your own units]) each with unique skill trees and abilities, and each with a different playing style. Go stealth/critical damage, ranged caster, close combat disruptor or otherwise, any character will offer you a challenging experience. Only a handful of maps and game modes to choose from, but don't be alarmed; it doesn't get boring if you play multiplayer. Optional community mods available to crank up the gameplay, too, if that's your thing. All around, just awesome *****
107	1	a	Have you heard of LoL?
109	1	a	This Honestly might be the most nothing game ever created. Like, people put their heart and soul into this game, writing pages of lore and spending years devloping it. But then you play it, and you right click on some one, and it goes ok, and maybe there is a spell or two and then you die and come back, and you buy items and you arent sure if they did anything and then you win or lose and you hhave NO IDEA if it was because of you. 10/10
111	1	a	Pretty good game. I've only played it single player, as I was a forerunner for our group of players, but they all play LoL, and without the ability to buy a 4 pack after purchasing a single instance of the game, we probably wont be playing this as a group. Steam needs to change the ability of a current owner of a game to be able to purchase a 4 pack as gifts. So be warned, buy the 4 pack, and not the single player.  The maps are the best part of the game. The fact that things change, and it's not the same laning every. single. time.... Makes this game better than most of the other MOBAs out there. A change of scenery is nice every once in a while....
113	1	a	It´s a short fighting game and DOTA-like. But is a great idea and an intense multiplay game. Reward your friends with 'no mercy' ;)
84	0	a	this game looks cool as ♥♥♥♥ bit it isnt dont be fooled by the trailer corny narrator ♥♥♥♥♥♥ gameplay pretty sure online community is dead I hope you like single player that is just multiplayer but youre alone with NPCs +1 for being able to zoom close as ♥♥♥♥ into the battle -10 for being ♥♥♥♥ and stealing my $2.49 3/10 ♥♥♥♥ game dont buy
115	1	a	You like LOL? You like Dota2? This game is for you. Around 15-20 Heros playable, standing ready to follow you into death. The concept is very balanced, nothing to worry about. As far as I´ve seen this game sometimes lacks of having some extra adrenaline between pausing time/ trader time. But still there is much game experience waiting for you. Definetly worth it, if you´re trying to be not that mainstream as others. ;)
117	1	a	This game is kind of interesting in a few ways. It reminds me of DOTA from Warcraft 3 in many regards, but on a small scale. I really only played the single player and it was kind of fun. I suppose if you can find a good deal on this game it is a worthwhile purchase, because you should get a few hours out of it and it is fun to kill time with every now and again. I just would not expect an amazing game.
119	1	a	its an ok game.. takes a bit to get used to though
121	1	a	This game is a lot of fun, but the trailer is a little misleading about what kind of game it is. JOIN ME!!
123	1	a	I'd recommend this game to some people who have a few friends looking for some fun to be had. I play this with my dad a lot, and we usually play against three to four enemies on Nightmare mode. This game isn't meant to have an incredible storyline (sure, it's fun to see what havoc your demigod would wreak upon the world, but honestly, I don't always have time to play ten rounds of the same repeating map over and over just to see that little snipit) but it is incredibly fun to play with some friends. Yes, there aren't a lot of classes to choose from, but the fact that there are a good amount with a large skill tree for you to go down, a few varying mapas, AND the ability to change game types (conquer, fortress, etc.), it makes the game worthwhile.  If you don't have several friends (and hey, I'm not judging) who want to play a fun and tactical game with you, then I would say don't get it. But if you have at least one friend who wants to play a few rounds with or against you, then definitely, you should pick up the game and at least give it a try.
125	1	a	Oh for the love of god guys, make a new one of these and cut out the two log ins and lack of ladders.
127	1	a	its no Dota but gather a bunch of your friends and this game can easily entertaine you for a few hours other then the lame A.I and very few map and character selections, no real complaints Demigod even had features that i would not mind seeing in dota, such as base upgrades.   if this game had a little bit more work, polish, and love put into it, it could have been great
129	1	a	An amazing game that suffered a poor launch, and could have been as big as League of Legends if it wasn't for stardock messing up their end of the job with the netcode. Demigod was a true victim of Piracy, at launch it had around 18,000 units sold while there were over 100,000 players on the servers.   Extremely solid ARTS, all of the characters work well together and are interesting enough. Voice acting is ok. The music is cliche but definitely good enough to get you into those intense moments. Graphics mostly hold up to today's standards even though the game is from 2009.
131	1	a	It's a good intro MOBA I suppose. I'd still rather play League though. 3.5/5
85	0	a	This is a MOBA. I'm not sure I understood that before I bought it but once I was in a game I realized, oh, this is laning and pushing and knocking down towers. There's a few differences, you take territory rather than simply wrecking enemy towers, and you can spend money to benefit your entire team with team upgrades and tower upgrades, as well as purchasing things for yourself. And you can have an army of your own minions, to either back you up or handle a different objective than your hero. The heroes are all pretty slow and the maps are pretty big so you do spend an enormous amount of time walking back and forth to buy things and heal and return to battle. Not long into any game the heroes get so powerful that if you are absent from a lane for even a moment, an enemy can take out a tower or two, so I find that a high HP and regend build is sort of OP, allowing you to stay in lane and push, even if your DPS isn't very good. Just being present matters more than being powerful. Some characters appear to be suited for certain roles, IE assassins or tanks, but some characters seem a bit strange. The plant lady would seem to be to be suited best with a big minion army, but she can also tank a bit, and has quite a bit of tower damage and creep extermination, leading me to think that the characters aren't very balanced. If that character has one good build but is flexible enough to be effective at literally everything else, I don't think the character's central role is powerful enough to not opt into the other branches of their tree. Though honestly in my experience the games last so long that you max out nearly everything by the time you win. Again, the heroes get pretty strong. You may spend a lot of money upgrading your towers and minions but it may not matter later on. This leads me to think that completely balanced hero upgrades does not mean that the other upgrades in the game are as balanced. The controls aren't quite fluid and there are times when I died because of it, but eventually I simply learned the quirks of the controls and the incomplete physics of bodyblocking to better avoid stupidly dying to inadequate game physics.  In my opinion this isn't nearly as fun as it should be. A MOBA where you effectively play as really huge characters and you take territory, it sounds really good as a recipe, but the result isn't quite as satisfying as the recipe sounds.
86	0	a	In desperate need of a single player campain. Sad, this game could have been pretty good. The lack of a campain left me wondering what to do, and quickly wondering why I was playing. A small gripe would be that the fluff desciption of the all father disapearing is wrong, the game into says he was killed. This proto-moba could have had a lot going for it, and I would be thrilled to see some of the demi-gods show up in Smite, as at least 2 (Sedna and Queen of thorns, aka The Obsidion Butterfly) are real historical dieites. The Queen may show up, shes Aztac/Mayan, but i doubt they will fit in a lone Inuit diety in the mix. Still between the two Sedna is the one with a dwarf planet named after her.
133	1	a	very interesting game, it is a nice mix of strategy and brutal fun. also reminds me of some starcraft 2 mod games. a good buy indeed
135	1	a	Anybody who is into DOTA/League of Legends is going to pick up this game very quickly. On the positive side of the differences are going to be that there are many more maps &amp; game modes than DOTA/LoL provide. Outside of the items/equipment you can purchase in the game, you can also purchase upgrades for your structures, towers &amp; creeps. Skill trees are much more detailed &amp; allow for more possibilities than the normal 4-skill loadout that DOTA/LoL offers. Another thing that is offered is the ability to rotate your map, which is something that hasn't been offered by DOTA/LoL, yet. There are also a couple single player modes which is something that DOTA was never able to do &amp; LoL only allows in custom matches. On the negative side of the differences, playable characters are rather limited. If you'd like to try before you buy, there is a demo you can try out.

139	1	a	The best example of a build em up MOBA out there, where you can spend your money improving the team as well as yourself. PLUS THE FORCES OF DARKNESS HAVE CONSTRUCTED A FINGER OF GOD! Never gets old, and tons of chacters with unique mechanics.
141	1	a	A nifty old Dota style game that is nifty fun and a blast to master.
143	1	a	This Honestly might be the most nothing game ever created. Like, people put their heart and soul into this game, writing pages of lore and spending years devloping it.

145	1	a	Dont play in Australia, it lags like Crazy
147	1	a	This game is a great play for passing time. You know LOL and Dota well how about trying out Demigod. Sadly for every MLG wanna be there is no such thing for this game like there is in LOL and Dota
149	1	a	very interesting game, it is a nice mix of strategy and brutal fun. also reminds me of some starcraft 2 mod games. a good buy indeed

153	1	a	If you enjoy League of Legends or DotA in any way, this is a good stand-alone game that takes those elements, adds great graphics, more diverse skills and trees for heroes, upgrade system to the Citadel (base), and even has some light RTS elements controlling minions (depending on if you pick an Assassin or General). It's not 100%, but it's cheap and has great potential!
155	1	a	Awsome Game. Single player is fun in any mode. few online players but a great dota/ LoL style game you can play with friends!
157	1	a	Great fun. If you like DotA 2 then you will centainly like this. 7/10
159	1	a	love that game
87	0	a	It was good for the 1st two hours...  then like any stardock game, bugs and crashs and bs.  no one plays it in groups... no one plays this game.  It is made by a company of con artist looking for cash because no one as taken them to court yet for fraud.  Total rubbish you get tired of fast  1/10 for the 2hours of game play tell it got old as butter in a heart attack
161	1	a	This a perfectly balanced, gorgeous looking, strategy packed strategy game in the vein of DotA and LoL. I love it more than both of them; I only wish more people played it online.
163	1	a	It´s a short fighting game and DOTA-like. But is a great idea and an intense multiplay game. Reward your friends with 'no mercy' ;)
165	1	a	I really love this game. Sadly the player base for it has fallen out a bit but that was largely due to the terrible online that stardock provided with it's release. Now that the online has been corrected this is one of the best MMOB's that I've played.
88	0	a	Cannot redefine the camera movement and rotation keys so you're stuck trying to control the game according to how someone else wants you to do it. Also, no tutorial.
167	1	a	This a perfectly balanced, gorgeous looking, strategy packed strategy game in the vein of DotA and LoL. I love it more than both of them; I only wish more people played it online.
169	1	a	Better than DOTA 1&amp;2, but lacking in playable characters. but the toons you do get to roll seem powerful and semi-durable. not weak and flimsy like DOTA. HAVE FUN!
171	1	a	This game is a lot of fun, but the trailer is a little misleading about what kind of game it is. JOIN ME!!
173	1	a	Worth getting as an alternative to DOTA kind of games. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Sometimes it's much harder than League of Legends pvp.
175	1	a	A game all can master except for Grant Cox.
177	1	a	Great game! 5*
179	1	a	A great underrated moba with no player base, come help me expand it!
181	1	a	Most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game ever btw they should pay you to play this game.
183	1	a	DOTA-style game. Not as rushed as DOTA or LoL. Not much online community behind it, but I like to play single player when I just want to stomp on some AI.
185	1	a	it's ok, although I'm p. sure the multiplayer is dead
187	1	a	Fantastic game, hugely underrated.
189	1	a	I think this is a great take on the MOBA style of gameplay. Albeit that there are quite a small number of heroes to pick from, it is a well made game that I have been playing since it was released on Impulse. If you are a fan of LoL, Dota, or HoN, I highly recommend getting this game.
90	0	a	In desperate need of a single player campain. Sad, this game could have been pretty good. The lack of a campain left me wondering what to do, and quickly wondering why I was playing.

191	1	a	It is too bad Gas Powered Games didn`t have success with this title. It *is* likely the best game of its kind, even to this day. A problematic networking history hobbled them early, preventing 100% of their post-launch efforts from providing enormous expansion. That said, still an extremely worthy diversion. Solid mechanics, very thoroughly developed &amp; unique characters to play.
193	1	a	This games fun if your looking for a casual bttle arena game, or a fun alterntive to Dota or LoL but without the competition.  To bad i dosent have more Demigods and Arena's.
195	1	a	Oh for the love of god guys, make a new one of these and cut out the two log ins and lack of ladders.
197	1	a	LoL is for ♥♥♥♥♥♥S
93	0	a	Well this game is fun, its a bit clumsy and need to get some work on to meet the potential it has. I was rly hoping to see more building customization options in this game cos lets face it, you cannot beat LoL or Dota 2 on same rules , im playing Demigod not cos im bored of LoL or D2 but cos i was hoping to see something more , like moba + tower defence mix. Im voting Yes only cos i think this game have huge potential but right now it's not realized yet  And champions need faster moving speed, its rly annoying to move so slow lol
199	1	a	The awesome Christopher Lee is voicing this ! Game is pretty fun, doesnt feel old. A bit worried about replayability but hey its 5 bucks and I can see myself taking this up a few months after stopping it for a quickie
201	1	a	Last patch broke the game and it was never fixed, shame really as it was a great game :(
203	1	a	not the best game ever its visually stunning but the controls are tiresome and you feel less like you have control and more like your watching the computer play itself..
205	1	a	It has been a while since I wanted to play Demigod and I'm happy to say I'm pretty satisfied, despite a few negative reviews I've read about it. In fact, I fully agree that Demigod is a really underrated game, and it's one of the few MOBAs I could relate to Dota in terms of quality.  It doesn't have the complexity of the previous one, but it is still quite entertaining even so. It requires thinking and study - although not as much as Dota -, mainly due to it's minions system. Being so, the game doesn't feel boring after a while - even though, I guess an in-game recommended item build would be very helpfull. While it is a bit hard to add inovative elements to the game genre, Demigod succeeds in having it's own traits that defines it's originality. Each hero has a unique story and they all seem to avoid the commonplace; it's quite easy to feel empathy for some characters (such as Rook - literally a moving castle). What may bother some is that the game's active community is actually pretty scarce. The AI is enough to keep the game fun and interesting; but being a MOBA, it is possible to feel the lack of other players after a while. In summary, I do recommend Demigod, it surely is worth it's cost. The game succeds in keeping you entertained, even though you have to rely mainly on playing against the AI.
207	1	a	If you played the demo and thought you liked it I reccomend this. It is a team vs. team game. It is like League or Dota, but from the 2000s. This game is older, but still very fun in a different way that I can't put my finger on. I recommend that you get this game if you have the time and money for it.
209	1	a	At least it's better than league of legends
211	1	a	Quite a brilliant game once you get into it, absolute must for any and all DOTA fans. Tad short perhaps - for the fun that it is, but luckily there's always multiplayer.  Registration system sucks ♥♥♥ though, especially if you owned this one before it got on the steam....
213	1	a	Demigod can be compared with LoL, although LoL is much better Demigod does have more realistic graphics and skills to be used. Overall good time killing game ;D
215	1	a	Before the DOTA/MOBA games really took off commercially (i.e before HoN, LoL, DotA2, etc) Demigod lept onto the bandwagon and bought with it really nice graphics and fast paced action.  Unfortunately the game bombed, it came out too early in the fad when the original DotA had such a strong fan base that people passed by this game. But the thing is that it's a good game, it looks great, the classes are varied (even if there are only about 10 character choices), and it's pretty deep. Unlike other MOBA games Demigod allows you to not only spend money on your hero and his items, but upgrade your towers, nexus/castle, even minion waves.   It has a bunch of unique elements but it let down by the fact it never got the promised expanded champion roster, making this a game fun for LANs (until DotA2 released officially) but not for online play. Plus it's cheap!
217	1	a	This game was great, could have been much greater. besides the kind of generic item system this was really the best MOBA ive played, the costomization for each characters skills is far greater than any other, and the maps WOW. I would LOVE to see an updated free version of this game, it would be at the top in no time.   The only downside is there isnt really anyone who plays this anymore...
219	1	a	Fun game, took a little while to fiquire out because no tutorial, but after some trial and error it is worth a play.
221	1	a	9/10  The Campaign is short but gameplay is fun.   It's a game I've played for years and yet I still enjoy playing it every once and while.  My hours read 8.8 at the time of this review but I've played at least 15 to 30 hours
223	1	a	Well its a moba, and a unique one Btw if you play this first time the main problem is your MISSING CURSOR And i search a lot and the only solution i got is to WINDOWED MODE the game And you can enjoy the game after that :) The server is not too crowd so we must fill the server ourself Have fun 8/10 for me :3
225	1	a	this game is very awsome in graphics phisics. models +skill style, but tehre is noone in the multyplayer
227	1	a	Probably best when you're high.
229	1	a	A very fun MOBA game! It's very unique. I typically don't enjoy MOBA's that much, but I found this one to be really fun! I recommend it!
231	1	a	This is game is basically DOTA (WC3 Mod that took on a life of its own.) In it's current state it seems buggy, however the games community has released a number of fan patches that have made the game more enjoyable that can be used on line. I hated it at first, but found that these patches made the difference. This will never be a top 10 but for the price it s worth checking out.
233	1	a	Great game I enjoy the Uniqueness of each Demigod and I really wish people still play it online. I understand when the game was first realeased it was a complete mess and the netcode was messed up so no one could play online. Though I doubt it I really hope people will start to realize this game is alot of fun and will start to atleast get a small fan cult playing it
235	1	a	Demigod is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome. Play Demigod.
237	1	a	Such a cool game! How is this sooo cheap!?!?
239	1	a	Similar to DOTA or League of Legends. It's p sweet!

101	0	a	There is not much to this game just yet, and as such I cant reccomend it. There are 2 'classes'; one that is a bit tougher, and one that is a bit faster.   There are a bunch of different weapons, but as far as I can tell they all do the same damage and combos/specials, and a bunch of cosmetics (shirts shoes, pants, backpacks, etc.)      The core gameplay is running around whacking zombies with your melee weapon or shooting them with your range, your melee gets combos with finishers, combos being x--&gt; y x--&gt; x--&gt; y x--&gt; x--&gt; x--&gt; y and your pistol gets like a grenade charge thing.     As it stands now I cant reccomend this game, because as it turns out, this game is complete.
102	0	a	Backed this in early access so, so long ago. It just got pushed out as complete so they could keep the money, I guess. ♥♥♥♥ing rip-off.
103	0	a	  Got it free so no waste of money, but due to bugs surely a waste of time.
104	0	a	People gave 160 000 of their dollars for this on Kickstarter. What's the result? A blatantly unfinished game that was barely updated during Early Access and hasn't evolved enough since.
105	0	a	Its abandoned for over one year. Nothing moves and they just squeeze out the money from customers giving em an 20% done Alpha version. If you want to burn your money just hold a lighter under your money bill. it will do the same effect but faster and less frustrating

114	0	a	  this game is very fun I got it from a giveaway on alienware arena not really expecting not to like it but so far I am really enjoying myself. but i dont really think it is a complete game and should still be in early access because there is just not enough features and things to do I really think this game has potential but needs more work done on it and more to do in the game so unless more things get added to the game i cannot reccomend the game for the price there selling it for. but definetly worth free from that giveaway. The moment they fix the bugs, properly optimize it and add the content needed to be a full game I will easily give it a thumbs up but till then I would hold off on buying it because there is no guantee they will add what is needed into the game.

116	0	a	  Promising upon first impressions... I customize a little character with a ton of different weapons/clothing/accessories/hair, the menus navigate well enough, and then hop into the first level... MASSIVE stuttering during most mouse movement despite pushing &gt;100FPS, movement acceleration per key press that resets on direction changes so the movement is unresponsive and incredibly clunky, mouse aim feels completely off, weapon changes and abilities often don't work while making other inputs, etc. The melee combat has no weight to it, and the shooting at least with the revolvers I chose offer some of the least satisfying gunplay I've seen in years irrespective of the stuttering.  I made it through a bad tutorial with timers for each section so you have to wait even after you've completed the objective, and a few of the levels, but when I go back to the customization and find EVERYTHING I had access to on first launch is now locked behind large exp and currency requirements, and simply entering that menu reset my character to defaults even though it stuck fine prior during the first few levels.  Judging by how the movement operates, and the hitching (almost outright freezing at times) during mouse camera movement, I have a feeling this was designed for controller despite having seemingly functional key rebinding. I'd whip out a controller and try it, but honestly f*k that, there's no way I'd want to play a 3rd-person shooter without mouse aim, so there's no point.  I remember seeing this 4 years ago during their Kickstarter campaign, and then again last year when Jim Sterling covered the first builds. The only thing I can see that has changed since is the effect when the 'mayhem level' increases, that and there's no insane stuttering likely because he used a controller. The original pitch and concept art was absolutely superb... interesting classes and abilities, fantastic style, color choice, and atmosphere... this 'released' game (minus the amount of customization options and the visuals) is as if it's still in the programming stage before even pre-Alpha, before core gameplay has been established.  It's so disappointing it's painful... so imagine how the Kickstarter backers feel about the state of this, and the fact that I just got the game and it's DLC for free from their Alienware promotion, and not the $8.29 they just sold it for in the sale two weeks ago, or the $15 they charged  4 years ago  on Kickstarter.

120	0	a	  Honestly, this game is awful. I won't be playing this again anytime soon.
121	0	a	  Do NOT play this game atm. It's very bad.
122	0	a	  It's really meh. A brawler game for kids, with very little content. Like 4 animated models grand total, plus some generic assets, set on a tiny map.
123	0	a	  what's the different between boy and girl again?  - no difference between highest and lowest settings - often crashed/lag for unknown reasons
124	0	a	  Not worth the price tag at all, they basically tried to sell a $2-$5 CDN game for $10.99 CDN. If on sale for cheap and you want to play a left 4 dead style game with a store using in game currancy without micro transactions thats pretty easy to get, and is somewhat challanging with 3d cartoonish graphics go ahead. But not worth the full price.
125	0	a	  Recieved for free through Alienware.  In the game's current state I could only play the training level... Literally, there was no way to play any maps after that to see if tere was a plot or otherwise, as opposed to just running around a single yard bashing zombied while being told the goal is to bash zombies in certain ways.
126	0	a	This game is not finished. The controls are janky. The graphics are unpolished. The physics are jarring. The levels are repetitive baseball bats to the face of nearly harmless zombies.  The concept was cool, which is why I backed it on Kickstarter years ago. Unfortunately, this game is just that―a cool idea with no execution.
127	0	a	Kickstarter backer. Watched the game get passed to a different team. Since then we've seen very few updates (even less meaningful).  It's somewhat sickening that this game no longer has an Early Access tag... it clearly fits the criteria.   There is one map. It's somewhat large, but one map is one map. Mobs are bare-bones. Barely have textures. They all look the same once you start playing.  The two classes only control differently under the hood. Skills and such. Movement and combat are completely the same regardless of what you choose.   There's a lot of cosmetics, but the vast majority are simply retextures of say ten or so different models.  There are different modes, but they all just seem like placeholder junk. Kill X amount of mobs. Kill the boss. Explore the school. They're all pretty boring, and mindless.   The game feels unfinished because it IS unfinished. The original developers talked about this fantastic experience that 'all kids dreamed of'. What we've got here is a dry, hallowed out version of that. There seems to be a resident developer roaming the forums, but updates are very few and far between. I have doubts that he/she is actually part of the dev team, and may just be assigned as such because of his ties to the game.   It's a shame that I can't really think of any other game for you to get if this kind of thing appeals to you, but I really can't recommend this unfinished beta product to anybody. Especially not at the pricetag listed.
128	0	a	  I thought this game would be good but it ended up being terrible. The characters you play as are suppose to be kids but in reality they look like 40 year old pedophiles. The weapons are weak as ♥♥♥♥ against the zombies, a gun is suppose to do more damage not a plastic ♥♥♥♥ing baseball bat. The customization in this game is terrible too. It is fun, but I do not recommend buying it. It is more like an alpha to be honest...

131	0	a	  DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!  UPDATES: The last update for this game was OVER a year ago! Developers since then did not post an update.  PLAYERBASE: The game during its release has never reached 2 average players. I sat in the lobby for 10 minutes attempting to find a game. Alienware is still hosting a giveaway which started 23 days ago and yet the game still has not seen over an average of 4 players.  http://steamcharts.com/app/215550#All    TL;DR - Game is dead, developers left it, and the game gets redundant after 2 minutes.

156	0	a	  This is one of the worst pieces of garbage i have ever played in my entire life. My steam account consists of more than 500 games, 300 of which i can say are ♥♥♥♥♥♥. This trumps all of them in one fell swoop. Me and a friend of mine played together since we got it for free on alienware arena. We were the only two playing at all this week. Would not reccomend.

158	0	a	I'm editing my previous review out of newfound spite for this game.  My previous review stated that I would recommend this game with a fantasticly placed and thought out 'na'  Seeing the development of the game, I would like to reconsider my absolutely awful review and say that my review clearly stated the quality, time and care that the developers put into this mess of a game.   Basically, don't waste your time; the game is NOT done and NEVER will be. You will probably have better fun burning paper and stapling yourself in the face, and you won't have to pay for that.   I refuse to mention any of the gameplay because, there simply is none.
301	1	a	Perfect gift for all your Christian friends.
159	0	a	First off, I really wanted to like this game. The setting, the story-telling, the opening cinematic -- everything about its thematic texture is just so sadistically appealing.  Unfortunately, the product that the trailers, the game descriptions and even other reviews prepared me for was not the product I got. I expected a demonic sandbox chock full of whimsically creative murder. Instead, I got a mediocre Hitman clone with exactly one (absurdly specific) solution for each murder.  The game teases you with all of these awesome powers straight out of The Omen: telekinesis, mind control, pyromancy. But you can really only use them when the game feels like it.  I would be fine with the restrictions on your mayhem if the game provided some semblance of direction. Instead, you're left to aimlessly wander the game's massive mansion, searching for the tiny, sometimes pixel-perfect item you need to proceed.  The best example of my frustration was a mission where you had to off your family's beloved butler.   (SPOILERS OH GOD OH GOD SPOILERS PEOPLE SPOILERS) (SPOILERS OH GOD OH GOD SPOILERS PEOPLE SPOILERS) (SPOILERS OH GOD OH GOD SPOILERS PEOPLE SPOILERS)  The in-game prompt informs you that it's winter, and it would be a terrible shame if the ancient old goof slipped and fell.   Alright, fair enough -- I probably have to create some ice, huh, Lucius? Let me just grab one of the dozens of interactive cups dotting the mansion, and we'll be off.   Wait, what's that? I can't use any of the cups on the sink? Well, then... how am I supposed to get water, bro? Oh, you mean I need a water bottle, because that's 'less suspicious?' Okay, fine... Are you gonna maybe give me a hint about which of the mansion's 20+ rooms would be a good place to start? No? Great...  So, the kitchen then? Nope! The servants' quarters? As if! My bedroom, you say? Oh, you've gotta be ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ me, Lucius. It's in my bedroom? The very start of the level, which you purposely led me away from via the in-game objective marker? The furthest possible point from where you gave me my mission objective? Fine, Lucius. Fine. I'll go get the ♥♥♥♥ing water bottle.  Now I've probably got to just dump it on the ground by the doorway the butler's sure to walk through while attending to the Christmas lights, right? Oh, that's not right? Of course it isn't, Lucius. Of course it isn't. Instead, I've got to find the one incredibly tiny spot in the middle of the courtyard (the mansion's biggest room) where you want me to put it, don't I? Whatever, Lucius. I don't care enough anymore.  Oh, now the butler's taking his sweet time coming outside, huh? Not like he's supposed to be attending to the family during Christmas dinner or anything. Can I just wait for him to have a stroke, Lucius? No, that would be too easy. I'm guessing from your minimal exposition that I'm supposed to tamper with the Christmas lights to get his attention, huh? Fine, let's get to tampering.  Naturally, I assume you won't let me use my telekinesis to pull down the lights. That would be too easy. And also fun. Too much fun for your liking, Lucius. So, what then? Do I need to find some misplaced tool in the farthest wing, only to backtrack to the fuse-box in the next room and fry the circuit breaker? That seems like something you would do, Lucius.   Don't argue with me -- it absolutely does sound like you, Lucius. Okay, fine then -- what do I have to do, buddy?  Ahh.... I have to turn off the Christmas Lights via a barely visible light-switch? In fairness, that's also just so you Lucius. So completely you.   There. I turned off the light-switch and now the butler's coming out. Oh, good! He slipped and fell! But, wait... he's still alive! So, I've got to finish him off... Oh, now you let me use my telekinesis, Lucius? Finally, when it's too late to matter?  You truly are a generous god, Lucius... 
303	1	a	Once upon a time there was a little boy called Lucius. He loved his bicycle, his cute teddy bear notebook and bizarre murders, you know like beheading a guy with a grass cutter. Do you really wanna know what's next? Did he make his father proud? Did anyone survive being under one roof with him? How many photos does it take to get a perfect picture of a naked uncle? Just play and you will find out.
305	1	a	Burnt some guys face off, killed a bunch of other people, worshipped Satan, came home and played Lucius. Its pretty good
307	1	a	Admittedly, most people won't enjoy this game. Games have changed and advanced, many scores are based on replayabilty, the scope of the enviroments, and freedom of variation in how to go about things. That's all superb standards to go by today, in open world/sandbox games. However, there is something to be said about restriction in games. With freedom of choice can also come a certain stress, and a sense of incompletion. There's the time and place for both, naturally, but some times there is something soothing and satisfying about playing a game the only way it's meant to be played.  'Lucius' is about exploring your surroundings and figuring out how the puzzles are solved. Sometimes the solution is far fetched, sometimes ridiculous. But all in all, there's some sort of logic there. I enjoyed this game far more than I probably should have. I liked it's simplicity, the house and garden, the idea of it all. Granted, there was much more potential behind the concept that was left unrealised, but for what it was, I enjoyed it.   Shiver Games tried to respond to peoples objections and critique to this first game somewhat in the sequel, which I can't speak of as I haven't played it, but, it did seem like that game have fallen apart in them trying to do so. It was probably more somewhat what they wanted the first 'Lucius' to be; being able to have access to a variety of tools to make death traps, lethal situations and weapons to off any number of roaming NPCs at any given point. From what I've read and seen though those ambitions resulted in a broken game with great potential. The more complex, the more wrong things can go.  'Lucius' has its fair share of bugs and limitations. But it also has a great idea behind it, and for me personally, finally getting the kill I was going for was surprisingly satisfying, as was achieveing 'good boy' status by doing mundane chores around the house. My guess is, if you get some self therapy by say, doing the dishes or painting the fence, you might enjoy this game. Get it on sale though.
309	1	a	'It's like Hitman with Lucifer' - IGN  I rate it 666/13 would hail Satan again.
311	1	a	Lucius is a game for those who enjoy (somewhat) brutally murdering members of their household in the form of a 6-year-old son of Satan. The graphics are fairly well done (in my opinion) and you have the option to customise the controls to suit you. As for the voice acting, there's not much to say. They did a good job and they worked well in the games setting. My only real issue (though it isn't much of one) would be the lack of an option to save. If you got caught, you had to start the level (next murder, they appear to save after each one) from the beginning which can be a hassle if your PC dies on you or you need to attend urgent business. Overall, I'd say it's a decent and well-done game by Shiver that I suggest buying if you like bloodshed as there can be some pretty surprising and nasty deaths along the line, all organised by one little boy. Lucius.
160	0	a	I really can't recommend this game much (maybe with exception of buying it for a very very low price). There is so much of unused potential it is sad. The basic idea is great but the execution is sadly lacking in almost every way.  You could think that in Lucius you will be placed in an open playground that lets you experiment with using environment for your intentions while there will be dynamic reaction of other people on your actions. But that is completely wrong. Instead of that you are forced to kill your victims in one and only exact fashion. No place for creativity or multiple ways to do that.  And the game is so unpolished. There is a load of bugs and glitches from the smaller (items in characters hands tend to move awkwardly during cutscenes) to really problematic (that can force you to repeat the whole mission). I can overlook some problems but there are just to many of them to be such benevolent with Lucius.  Also the core gameplay mechanics are poorly designed. For example you have paranormal abilities which you can use to manipulate others. To use them you have to switch to them...but then you can't use anything (open doors, search through drawers etc.) as that is also a separate ability. Or later in game you get a chance to conjure fireballs but when you begin to cast them the effect will cover your sight and you will not see what's ahead of you. There are also some 'stealth' missions where you are forced to do them over and over again (and there are really long loadings) until you learn how to go through them step by step.  Well, Lucius is not a good game. But it is not so horrible as it can sound from my words either. The story is actually ok, the slowly deteriorating mental state of your family is for the most parts well done and the voice acting is nice. But the game has so many gameplay issues, bugs and other things. Also the replayability is almost none.
313	1	a	 http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=269351837   Lucius is a third person puzzle/adventure game at heart while being about an antichrist who doesn’t talk, and tries to kill off his family to sell their souls for power.    Gameplay
315	1	a	Why are everyone complaining about graphics? I'd say this game is 7,5/10  Why?  + There's porn. + You're the evil child you've always wanted to become + You can use anything (sort of) just to kill them + Did I say there's porn?   - A lil bit glitchy when you use Telekinesis - The map is poorly done   You feel evil playing this game and enjoy it at certain times, so yeah I'd recommend you to get but 75% off.  Lack of Xbox 360 controller support, but nothing a mouse also a keyboard can't handle.  So, go fulfill your evil needs playing as a Satan spawn!
317	1	a	I totally owe this game a nice review.  No, I really do not approve of lil kids being possessed murderers, but this game is somehow compelling! I wasn`t searching for guides  or walktroughs, so it stroke me slowly in time - I will take care of every single one of them, one by one.    Even my ... oh my!!     So in this emotional state, you somehow need to loose your humanity  and try to focus on the FUN parts /there are plenty,  like the TRICYCLE, changing weather, some achievements, the way you need to listen,  watch and follow clues, the automatic innocent status, because you are supposed to be a little ANGEL not a little devil.. they will find out too late..  The atmosphere can satisfy your darker tastes, actually  the whole game does it. Give it a try :) Just don`t try any of it at home!! :D
319	1	a	Just finished Lucius, took me around 5 hours, and got 41 of 58 achievements.  Overall it's a pretty interesting game, you play a Lucius a 7 year old boy who lives in a mansion with his family and many maids, butlers and handymen who are under your fathers employ, except he's not your actually father, Satan is, you are the spawn of Satan who has been tasked with gather souls for your real father to acquire various powers like telekinesis, mind control and combustion. The games premise is just that, kill everyone for Satan, expect the ways you have to go about doing so are quite different and unique, the main gameplay mechanics feel like a mix between classic Hitman trial and error with it's environmental deaths. Where combining found items with environmental hazards usually result in a entertaining death cutscene and no suspicioun cast upon Lucius.  Now the story isn't great, the voice acting is hammy and weirdly paced making it sound like sentences are being stitched together from totally different actors and the animations aren't detailed either. Some of the characters are interesting enough, for example Lucius' grandfather is a hard man who has something to hide and his motives are shown throughout the game and give an interesting look on the family's rise to power and occult ties. The mother slowly losing her mind lead to some interesting ambient dialogue like her asking Lucius to brush his teeth in a loving tone then immediately telling him to bug off because he's creeping her out, it's more than likely a bug but humorous none the less. As far as visuals are concerned, they're entirely fine for the most part, there are moment's when the game can be quite beautiful and others when it looks like a scene from a cut Deadly Premonition level.   The flow they achieve between making the game challenging but not making it frustrating looking for obscure items and solutions to problems are troubling, far too often I had to look up a FAQ on what obscure non related item I needed to complete a task that could have been simply completed another, far simpler way. That also brings out how the limited the game actually is in it's structure and openness to the player, Dante's Mansion, the games only location, is large and sprawling with countless rooms and corridors but most aren't used frequently or at all.  As a closing thought, I did really enjoy the game, the absurdity of the kills and the way the narrative tries to justify 20 deaths in one house as accidents so the detective working the cases doesn't have to call the FBI, is dumb fun, and entertaining. I would recommend anyone who is a fan of the older Hitman games and likes using the environment to kill hapless victims to try this game out, you mind fun for a good weekend of kill all for the glory of old pop Satan.  + Environmental kills are fun and interesting + Graphics are nice in spots and the location is mostly well designed + Interesting idea and premise + Powers can lead to interesting gameplay mechanics  - Story is a little dumb, and stretches the players disbelief far - Voice action and animations are lackluster - Puzzles/Kills can be far too obtuse and can lead to frustration - Limited in it's scope and options to the player  7.5 out of 10
321	1	a	If Hitman had a son that son was the Anti-Christ, that son whould be Lucius. Luicius is a strange yet original game: it mix the old point and click with a small 3D open world. Your quest is to kill everyone in the house, 'cause you need human sacriface for your daddy, some guy who work in the 'underground'. If you want to be a hero, and not a villian, this is not the game for you.  The story isn't bad at all, its actually pretty nice. Sure, it takes some forced ways into the story, and you clearly see them, but they won't bother you much. At least, it didn't bother me, it actually made the game much more interesting.  The ending isn't also bad, but it left me with a feel of uncompletionist. Probably was too fast.  The gameplay works fine: you have to collect items around the house to complete goals to kill people and make the homicides looks like accidents. Sadly the difficulty goes to insanely hard that 'I don't even know what to do' to 'this is so easy that even a 6 years old kid whould do that'. Did I mention you're a 6 years old kid?  The music it's pretty fitting, but it gets repetive real soon. And expecially sometimes it bugs out, like it disappear or change theme out of nowhere and you don't know what's goin on, even tho' nothing is goin on.  The graphic its 'meh': there ain't no good facial expression, and the lip sinc its all broken, but for some reason, the ambiance looks awesome, and the gore works fine.  It seems the creator couldn't put in some good face flexes.  I've encounter some bugs and glitch along the game, and sometimes they made me restart the mission. For exemple, I opened the journal during a cutscene, and the game freeze. Couldn't move. Or in a cutscene, I was riding the tricicle before that happened, and Lucius was flying around. (this picture might contain SPOILERS)  http://cloud-4.steampowered.com/ugc/579027346723227969/8889A751021635A9C4A9E9FBBE99D46D33B78408/   Final Score: 6.5/10  Overall, the game its fun, not too long (around 6-7 hours of gameplay) but it's a nice title. Maybe 20€ can be a little too much for it, I suggest to get it around 5€ like I did.
323	1	a	It is so twisted :')  Prepare to see a lot of messed up scripted deaths, and a lot of ♥♥♥♥ed up things like naked maids. Chodes and a perverted kid. All the reason to buy it :)
325	1	a	This game gave me nightmares and herpes for 40 hours.
327	1	a	Officer McStuffins is the worst cop in the history of all cops ever.
329	1	a	  Nice game with a good story. Killing all those people in all those different ways was a lot of fun, but it's a bit too limited in that area: each person can only be killed in a single specific way, so there's no room for creativity, although that kind of makes each death a bit more meaningful. There are 2 messed up achievements though: you have to play the game for 20 and 40 hours. It has zero replayability and can be beaten in less than 10 hours, but sure, I'll definitely play it for 40 hours.
331	1	a	Lucius is classified as an adventure game, but I feel like it deserves its own genre: Murder simulator. You play as, essentially, the son of the devil and stealthily murder people one by one. It's a twisted concept that is pulled off very well and is surprisingly fun.  Storytelling isn't this game's strong point as it isn't written or acted very well and seems to take a second seat to the gameplay. In a normal adventure game this would be a problem but here, gameplay is the focus. Otherwise it does have a similar structure to other adventure games: picking up various objects from the world, combining them, and discovering ways to use them to accomplish your current goal. Lucius is a third-person 3D game though which is unusual for the genre.  The main drawback of this game is that it can be very difficult to figure out what to do to progress, especially in the later chapters. The mansion is quite large and the game generally only gives you vague clues about where to go and rarely what you actually need to do there. You end up with a lot of useless items in your inventory which confuse things even further.  For the technical aspect, the graphics aren't very good and it requires a surprising amount of power to render them. Loading times are surprisingly long for the graphical quality but not long enough to make the game annoying to play. The engine also has a constant persistent stutter like the Gamebryo engine that seems to be impossible to get rid of.  If I had to sum up Lucius in two words, I'd say 'delightfully twisted.' It's great fun despite the technical issues and poor writing.
333	1	a	Lucius - This game is good, its not the best though. I'd only buy it if it was on sale.  This game is very entertaining to play, the different death's throughout the game are quite good, however I think this game would be better if you could decide how to kill each person yourself. Like if you had several choices of how to kill each person.  I think the different powers you get when playing are okay, but I think they might have been a bit pointless for some parts since you barely use one or two of them. But that's my opinion I guess.   I do recommend this game, its a real time killer if your waiting for a better game to download or something, haha! Just buy it when its on sale, £14.99 is a bit much for a game that is only about 4-5 hours of gameplay.
335	1	a	It feels really good to be the bad guy once in a while, and it feels even better to be the one who scares and not the one who gets scared in an 'horror' game
337	1	a	Despite its ups and downs, I think overall it’s a good game. If you just remember that it is a game and it would have been really difficult to give it the kind of freedom you might have been expecting, that is.   (I tried to keep this one fairly short but alas, that just didn’t happen. Prepare your attention span!)  I meant the above in the sense that this game tries to give you an “open feeling to it, as if it’s not linear and you are wreaking havoc at your own expense. But when you get down to it, it is linear. It’s quite closed and it’s more of an organised chaos then just plain ol’ chaos. Given that, it’s still a very enjoyable game. I would consider this game still quite indie, so that makes me think even more that for what resources they had or what they were capable of with a small team, they pulled off a really decent game.  Because of how the gameplay is laid out, each chapter you’re given a new target and in ways it kind of felt like more of a puzzle to figure out what you had to do with them rather then you plotting your own devilish plan. Which I still found quite fun.   There was a few times I really had no idea what I was supposed to do. Especially at the beginning when you get past the early stages of the game where parts of the house are blocked off and you can’t roam around as much. When the game stopped leading me to where and what I was supposed to do and I was finally able to access the whole house, I wasn’t sure on how it was supposed to work. Can I pick them off in any order, do I have to do them in an order and if so, what is the order, or what? Well, after wondering around for a long time completing chores of which I wasn’t sure of why I was doing either, I finally figured it all out.  So, if you get something similar I’d just say stick with it, it all becomes clear as you go. My state of confusion didn’t last too long and in all honesty I can be dumb as hell sometimes.   In terms of story it was interesting. I wasn’t really sure of where they were going with it or how the whole thing was going to conclude but I was eager to find out. It’s nothing too profound or life changing but it was definitely not predictable or disappointing.   The English voice acting in this game is a little cringe worthy at times. It’s not horrifically bad but you can tell there is no Academy Award winners amongst the lot. The worst in my opinion being the stereotypically drunk Irish janitor.  With that said, I don’t think this game is primarily English. So I can see how the English voice acting might be a little lacked if they were focused mainly on another language.   Moving onto graphics. The graphics are pretty decent and I think I would say that “scenery and general surroundings-wise is where its strengths are at. The AI and character models however are not the best. I got a very “Garry’s Mod videos before Valve Source Filmmaker feeling off of it at times. I might be over exaggerating a bit there. I think it’s just the expressions and slight glitches to the models that gave me that feeling. The AI is very robotic, the characters wonder around the house replaying a laid out routine (which I guess they have to on some level, seeing as certain characters need to be “lured to a certain place and you can only do that by waiting for them to lap back around to where you need them). They also shout the same sets of dialog at you whenever you get within a certain radius of them (doesn’t even matter if there’s a wall between you, you WILL get yelled at through walls).  Just to moan about the characters that tad bit more and bore you all to death when it’s not really necessary because I actually like the game, I am going to mention the lack of… well… character… that I felt from our little man Lucius.  This isn’t something that bothered me all that much but I thought it worth mentioning.  I love the concept of playing as a slightly younger character. “Among the Sleep Is what I’m going to be comparing to. Among the Sleep was a game where you played as a toddler and the child like mannerisms and little gestures and what not in that game really impressed me. You walk, talk and generally act like a toddler. You run too fast? You’re poor little baby self will fall over.  Maybe this wasn’t the best comparison to use seeing as the obvious age difference with the two characters in the two games. A 2 year old Vs. a 6 year old is hardly the same. But I kind of felt that the fact Lucius is so young and therefore it being so disturbing him being so sadistic, wasn’t emphasised enough. I kind of felt like I was just playing as a midget adult. Which, I guess you could argue he isn’t like a child at all and maybe that is the point? But, I think I would have enjoyed it a bit more if Lucius had more “demon child like characteristics. Especially given that your character doesn’t speak, mute characters usually need something to show their character in others ways then just talking. Or maybe I am just over analysing!  In terms of achievements this one is very doable. I played through the whole game and ended up going back for some achievements (which is easy to do seeing as there is a chapter select included). I’m currently at 97% and in honesty the last two I need are baffling as too why they’d even add them in. The last two are for playing the game for 20 and 40 hours. Now, I’d say I must have played through the game one and a half times. With that I’m at 9 hours at the moment. Now, with some simple maths you can obviously see that you’d need to play the game a nonsensically amount of times to actually get the 40 hour achievement. I know it’s titled “I’m addicted but I think I’d actually feel genuinely worried for anyone that played a game about a demon child murdering people that many times. I think I’ll just idle for these last two! Other than that though, it’s an easy 100%.  EDIT: I have found that with the two last achievements, you cannot idle the game on the menu screen! You actually have to be in the game for it to work! (Hence why I have 72 hours on record, not just the 40 I need. Took me a while to notice it wasn’t working) I thought this was worth mentioning for any achievement hunters out there.  All in all, despite me moaning and droning on about certain things, I would say this game is great and well worth a try. It’s something a bit different and unique. It also has a sequel of which I think I’m definitely going to be trying out. If you’re looking for something fun and mischievous to play then this one is a good place to start. Overall I got a very positive feeling off of this one.   TL;DR: Quite linear, interesting story, kind of cringe English voice acting, decent graphics, alright characters, an easy 100% and generally a lot of fun. Definitely try it if you’re looking for a bit of mischievous fun.
339	1	a	Want to learn to kill people easily?  Want to know the secrets of a killer?  Want to spend a great time, playing something really good, considering, you are not too sensitive?  Play Lucius, you'll enjoy the game, for sure.
168	0	a	The game has quite a bit of cool aspects that I listed in pros. Ultimately I got bored and was not as entertained enough by the aesthetics to continue running around the mansion in search of items to use. I do not play this type of game frequently. I lost interest after a few hours of playing. I may pick it up again in the future.   Pros: -The story is interesting -The graphics are decent -The gameplay is fine -Neat secret rooms -Worth the price i paid ($ 5-10?) for the time it held my attention. -A good story unfolds as you advance and you get neat abilities  Cons: -Conitnuously walking around the house to find items that aren't explicitly/implicitly obvious or close by. This may cause you to walk around aimlessly for a while getting absolutely nowhere.. (or I am just not good at it.) -The time it takes to find items caused me to lose interest 
169	0	a	Game is incedibly unstable. It will slowdown and then crash if you break too many bottles. Did I mention there's an achievement for breaking bottles?  There's no manual save, so when the game crashes, you'll lose a lot of progress.  It controls poorly and perhaps worst of all, simply isn't all that fun. I can't recomend it.  EDIT: I've since finished the game and have softened a bit on it. The executions are creative if not necesaryily logical and the plot is coherent if unimaginative.   Between the instability and less than stellar gameplay, I still can't recommend it. It's the poster child of good idea, poor execution.  But if you get the game for free, and you're a fan of the Hitman series or hidden object games, it's worth a playthrough if you can get past the bugs.  Edit 2: And for you achievment hunters out there, Lucius has 2 time based acheivements. Play for 20 and for 40 hours. However, this game only takes about 10 hours to complete and that's if you're really taking your time. Each mission only has one way to solve it so the game has no replayability and the achievements force idling, but here's the kicker. Lucius can't even idle properly. If you alt+tab the window it doesn't count. Being at the menu doesn't count. You have to be in-game with the window in the foreground.  Yea.
341	1	a	definetly one of my favorites games, Lucius, scary game, lots of blood every where and maybe the best feeling to play in the night, i must admit that the game is pretty hard. I've rarely seen a game that embraces the bad guy as thoroughly and wholeheartedly as Lucius does. There's no hesitation, no complex explanations, no hedging of moral bets, or offering a suggestion that the game's victims kind of had it coming. In the game's opening minutes, the player is asked to lock a maid inside a walk-in freezer overnight, for no other reason than because the devil tells them to do it.Lucius is a singularly bleak and nasty experience, its only 'redeeming' characteristic being the utter straightforwardness with which it treats its darker subject matter. Not only does the game refuse to shy away from depicting the horrifically violent, it lavishes attention on the atrocities, showing them in slow motion from dramatic camera angles.
343	1	a	Lucius was born on the June 6th, 1966 and he was just a regular boy until his 6th birthday, when his true identity was revealed by his true father, Lucifer who instructed Lucius to orcastrate the deaths of the mansion's residents without anyone suspecting him, granting Lucius supernatural powers as he succeeds. The concept is interesting, the graphics and soundtrack are quite good, the gameplay is great and the story is intriguing. Despite all the controversy surrounding this game for obvious reasons, I still recommend it.
171	0	a	Such an interesting concept, but such a poorly done product.  Pro: 1, interesting and immersive setting 2, quite a novel experience 3, nice Artwork (Skins, Landscape change with season, ...) 4, NPC development - distress grows as the game proceeds 5, sidequests (chores)  Contra: 1, the main character should depict a reckless, evil child - but no mimicry at all seems like a puppet -&gt; immersion lost 2, only one (two max) sentences per person per chapter, quite repetitive 3, clipping errors, items vanishing after telekinesis 4, some random audio artefacts (could be hw related) 5, powers should increase each chapter, but you only use them in the most basic form - no real progression 6, single solution problems - no replay value or deviation from plot 7, strange quest updates. like getting the pistol early requires you to retrace the steps to open the safe again (which is empty of course) 8, no saving between chapters   A bit more freedom, less plotholes and the sequel could be great.
345	1	a	Simulator of little killer. If real father is devil, why boy can not kill everybody? Daddy gives to him supernatural powers and he starts to kill from buttlers to family. One map - his house, in which so many cruel deaths. But only one thing is unintelligible - why nobody wanted to be fired after 3-5 accidents in the dangerous place, or they just did not have choice. 8,3/10
172	0	a	I was actaully pretty excited about this game so maybe I went into it with higher expectations than what I should have had.  All in all, it was a good buy for the summer sale; I got it really cheap (like $5 or something like that?). It's a fun concept and the progression with the powers seem nifty, but it's mostly the side quests that put me off. If they had a better tracking system for side quests, it would be a bit more fun, but they expect you to navigate a house you have no idea how to navigate. The only help you get is a map that only shows the direction of the main quest, but if you want to do any of the additional quests (which I did), you have to look up guides on how to find things, otherwise your'e scouring an enormous mansion without any direction or hint on where to look.  I don't have a problem doing the chores, but they need to give you a hint on where to find things - even if it's just a little one. You're either spending too much time trudging around the house looking for things, or you're looking it up online.  The voice acting and facial animations are poorly done. That's not TOO important for me, but it was a bit distracting from the cut scene.
173	0	a	Unfortunately, a game that looked so promising, turned out to be far from that. Lucius is a very simplistic point and click game that offers very little immersion, gameplay or anything else. The puzzles are mundane, if you can call them puzzles. You can complete the story in maybe 2 or 3 hours, if you can stand it for that long. The game offers no replayability and there are quite a lot of bugs around.  Avoid.
347	1	a	 The Devil is in the details
174	0	a	I've seen some reviews mentioning this game was some kind of killing sandbox.  This thing is completelly linear, annoying and unrewarding. Keeps you seeking random items in random places of a terribly designed mansion for kills that are too simple.
175	0	a	TL;DR: If you want a buggy satanic open-world-ish puzzle game,this might be the one for you,if it was cheaper.  This game is short and buggy.It didn't feel like a satanic murderer sandbox,like most reviews and curators have said,but rather a game that would belong to the puzzle genere.I,myself,have experienced quite a few (maybe a lot more than just a few) bugs trough my 2 times finishing the story.The one that bothered me the most was journal entries literally not appearing no matter what I done.My ouja board was the only thing that helped me commit the murders.They would all at once pop up only after I killed the person,and of course I had to use a walkthrough at certain points,even if it is not a thing I normally do.The other annoying bug was Lucius getting stuck in the ground in certain points of Dante Manor,making me restart the chapter.Kristen Stewart has MORE facial expressions than the main character,that doesn't really even look like a 6 year old,and this logic really ruined the immersion for me-basically,in that manor of rich and respectable people he was the only main character that dressed in a suit.A 6 year old.Not his dad,not the detective that tries to catch you,not his mom,only his grandfather if I'm not mistaken.The other bugs I was talking about were visible but not always ruining the gameplay,things like models becoming colourless,glitching out,etc.And the only thing I found is to blame were lazy developers,for even grammar is not correct sometimes,usually in the MAIN CUTSCENES.The Dante Manor,the place where the action of the game happens is also pretty repetitive itself,having two mirrored parts,only with different room layouts,giving the big bad house a repetitive feeling,and even despite it's maze like corridors,trust me,that layout is so simple you'll don't need the map anymore from chapter 6 onwards.The hitbox of your final spell 'Combustion' is very rough and not tweaked for individual models,it can only hit the chest I think,nothing will happen if you set someone's hand or foot on fire (so real).The turn-the-crosses-upside-down system is a bit cheesy,or cliche,whatever you want to call it.And if you may want an explanation to my 40 hours of playing it,I left it open,because there is an achievement where you need to play 40 hours,and as the other are really easy,with 3 quarters of them you have completed before you know it,it would be a shame to now make this one a perfect game...hell,even Dark Souls achievements are less annoying than leaving this damn game open 40 hours.
176	0	a	I can't really say it's bad.. but.. not enough hints, poor graphics, no possibility to choose how to kill.. if taken on sale ok though.. The main idea is very interesting, but i had to check on the net how to do some murders because i really had no clue.. 5.5/10

178	0	a	 tl;dr -&gt; In Lucius you play as an anti-social devil child who must kill different people in graphicto satisfy your father, Satan. Think Hitman, but if you were a satan-spawn and had much more restricted, linear gameplay.   First off, I want to make clear the fact that I really enjoyed the game and played it to completion, however, I have a very specific reason why I have given a 'do not recommend' rating - which will be explained below. Suffice it to say that I do not support certain types of developer behavior/gameplay mechanics when playing games.  I had the pleasure of having this game gifted to me by one of my very generous friends, and he wanted me to review it once I had a chance to play. Thanks again!   If you enjoy devil/demonic themes, graphic violence and death scenes, and being the son of Satan, than you will enjoy this game.  The aesthetics are good - the detail in the character models and background (ex: rooms of the mansion) are well-done. The music and sounds are good, and the BGM really matches the gameplay and themes - adding to the atmosphere set by the game. The story is okay, but nothing too fancy - you are a demonic child and must kill people to satisfy your father, the devil.   The controls are simple and easy to learn - the tutorials are always quick and helpful. The learning curve is minimal to moderate, the most difficult aspect of the game is probably figuring out the specific ways to kill your targets. To remedy this, you can unlock the music box, which is infused by Satan and will show you 'hints' whenever you activate it. In order to unlock this useful item, you must complete almost all (you can miss/ignore one) available chores in the game. Examples include throwing out the garbage, cleaning your room, and finding your mom's missing earings.  Overall, the gameplay is decent - each chapter requires you to kill someone in your mansion. Admittedly, the regular mansion setting may become boring, however, the game compensates for this by progressively unlocking more parts of the house to be accessible. When you begin a chapter, both your map and journal will help direct you to your target. Usually, you will be given good hints in your journal regarding the next steps to kill your targets. Again, if you find yourself having trouble, work to finish off your chores so you can unlock the music box.   As a devil child, crosses weaken your powers, so you must turn any crosses upside down to negate their effects. As you progress through the game, you will unlock new powers, like telekinesis, mind-erase, and combustion. Tutorials are provided by Satan whenever you receive new abilities. You can fail chapters by revealing yourself - which occurs if you use your powers (primarily telekinesis) within sight of others. Something I liked about the game is how you can do things that make subsequent missions much easier - usually by reducing time. For example, if you like exploring and picking up all available items, you will probably pick up an item that will allow you to progress through a future mission without having to double-back into the house. The house is fairly large, and the map helps a lot in orienting yourself with the landscape.  At the end of the game, you    have one of two routes to select, which changes the type of boss battles you face - I don't believe this changes the ending   . The ending is a bit anti-climatic, but the overall journey and cutscenes are pretty good. A number of the death scenes are fairly graphic, so that is something to be aware of if you are particularly squeamish. There are 20 chapters, allowing for a variety of death types and related puzzles. There is also a    peeping tom segment where you watch a maid taking a bath (you see breasts and some bush)   .  For achievement hunters, achieving 100% is not that difficult, however, there are two extremely ridiculous achievements - one requiring 20 and the other 40 hours of playtime. Note that this DOES NOT mean idling time, but actual game playtime. From what I've read and experienced, you cannot leave the game running with the menu on, or even stand straight. Some people like to have the W (forward) key held down so the character is always walking. Another silly achievement is cycling (unlocked by doing chores) for x miles because the achievement for sprinting x miles can be completed within one or two playthroughs. I have a big problem with this style of achievements because it is essentially gametime mining - and I absolutely HATE artificial-game-lengtheners. If you take your time with the game and do two playthroughs to    try both ending routes, when you could just as easily load the chapter and select the other option   , you could PROBABLY stretch the gameplay to ~10 hours.   The two achievements require 20 and 40 NON-IDLING hours. I find that absolutely ridiculous, given the amount of time it takes to complete the game. As an avid game reviewer, I just cannot accept or support this type of behavior. If these achievements were removed, or reduced to reasonable hours, then I would immediately switch my 'do not recommend' to 'recommend.' Even if you are not an achievement junkie, I cannot encourage this type of gametime farming - because I know there are always people willing to 100% complete a game.   If you like role-playing as the son of Satan, wrecking havoc on your family household in the name of evil, then give this game a try.   Recommend, but DO NOT support stupid game design practices as seen in the achievements.  Cheers, DJSF  @DJSF's Rogue Reviews 
349	1	a	I got this game as a gift, and oh boy I'm so happy about it.   The game's concept is simply amazing. You are pretty much the antichrist as a child and you kill people to please Lucifer and get stronger whilst not letting people find out about your real identity. The game is set up on a huge victorian-style mansion, with a lot of rooms to explore and designed in a way that it doesn't feel repetitive or confusing at all.   The gameplay  kind of mixes a sleath-ish style with an old-school game where you have to really search the rooms, collect objects and use them intelligently to complete each chapter. In fact, this game reminds me a lot of older games in the sense that it looks rather rough but presents an amazing gameplay experience.   The soundtrack  and voice acting were rather bad. The voice acting seems to be rather desynced with the model's mouth movements. It really seems as if the game was poorly dubbed from another language other than english. The soundtrack is rather repetitive and very uninspiring.   The achievements  are the best part of this game. They are rather easy to get but can be missed if the player doesn't pay attention. The only bad achievements are the 'I like this game' and 'I am addicted' ones, that the devs added to try to stretch the gameplay time. Fortunately there is a guide that teaches a method to work around them.  Overall this is an amazing game that is very underrated. You should probably buy it.
351	1	a	Lucius was a cheesy horror B movie style game. It follows somewhat in line with the story of the movie Omen. You’re a child who’s been possessed by the devil and given powers to murder people. It’s a pretty straight forward game with not much difficulty to it.  It was a decent game to play which had some funny and cool death scenes. It does have a slight challenge of trying to figure out what you need and how to kill your target. It’s all based in and around the house you live in.  Controls were a little wonky but do their job. I even setup my own configuration with the steam controller which worked out pretty good. Only issues I had with it were movement on the bike you can get for Lucius to ride around on.   Graphics weren’t bad just looked like something from years back. They get the job done and that’s all that really matters when playing a game. The look on Lucius’s face was a little disturbing.  Overall it wasn’t a bad game to play. It’s pretty straightforward and not very hard to complete. You can get most of the achievements from pretty much just playing the game. Give it a try sometime as it should be easy to find a cheap copy floating around as it’s been bundled before and I think even given away for free.
353	1	a	Meh, I have mixed feelings about the game. As much as I feel playing as the Son of The Devil, I cannot stop feeling this game is a little bit boring, after some of the few chapters. What makes it playable is the killings, and the end is climatic as Hell.  Get in on a sale day - it´s a game to play and finish during a weekend´s time, if you are into satanic stuff or if you despise the Abrahamic religions.
180	0	a	I can really only recommend this game if you get real cheap (right now it's 90% off and thus $2 making it worth it), but since the normal price is $20 I can't recommend this game. The reason I was interested in this game is because of the obvious: you're the son of the devil and you kill people. However the story doesn't really go beyond this (just the brief musings of the detective at the end of a chapter). You barely, if at all, get to know any of the people before you kill them. When there's no personality or character development with the characters then there's nothing felt when you kill them. I could forgive this if the ways that you setup the deaths of people weren't the very definition of linear. This too could be forgiven except the steps you take to setup the deaths are also very unintuitive. They aren't even puzzles; it's just a process of figuring out what weird way the developers want you to setup the next person's death. There's almost no thought or intelligence involved on your part.  Another thing I was interested in, like most people I'm sure, are the deaths themselves. Considering this game was supposed to have earned an AO for Adults Only rating from the ESRB (refused to avoid complications with release) I was a little disappointed. A couple of them are gruesome sure, but they've got nothing on some of the fatalities in the Mortal Kombat games (which are rated M for Mature). There is a kill that Lucius himself gets to personally make, but I was highly disappointed when we don't actually get to see Lucius do it. One minute he's standing there, and we know what he's about to do, but the next he's done it and we saw nothing. Boo!  You are slowly given 5 different powers to make these deaths happen. They can also level up in power when you make a new kill. Only problem is the concept of leveling them up is absolutely pointless because there's only 1 way to setup the death of a person and you are always at the right power level to do it. You don't get to use certain powers when you think you could either, because again there's only 1 way to make the deaths happen.  Pros: +Voice acting was decent or better, especially Lucifer's. +The basic concept.  Neutral: +-A couple of the deaths are cool. Most are forgettable. +-It's pretty easy to get lost; a minimap would've been nice. At least there is a map and a marker telling you where your kill target is located.  Cons: -The story lacks any depth beyond the obvious, and the characters themselves are given no time to develop or have much of a personality so that when they do die we the players don't care one way or the other. -Figuring out what to do next is part luck and part tedious searching of rooms and objects to find the right thing to interact with. -Completely linear death setups that don't allow creativity of your mind powers or anything else. -Mind powers have no depth despite being able to level up. -The graphics are pretty poor. Could be forgiven but the animations are also lacking which doesn't help the already lifeless characters.  Despite all this I am interested in the sequel and the promise that it corrects some of the issues here like linear deaths.
355	1	a	The Devil  literally  made me do it.
357	1	a	This Game was so awesome.I can't imagined what was in product mind when he start release this game.This child is so demonic.I finish this game and the final verdicted is:I waiting for Lucius 2 ((:
359	1	a	Lucius is a third person adventure puzzler where you basically play as the kid from The Omen. You are the son of the devil and are out to kill everyone by figuring out how to use your environment and use your demonic powers, without getting caught.  The graphics are good for what it does, and the gameplay is satisfying. It also has some really gruesome death scenes. Characters act like people, they slowly grow more and more tense as their world gets worse.  Recommended for fans of horror and adventure alike.
361	1	a	Nice little 3rd person puzzler. 3rd Person point and click gameplay.  It is incredibly buggy though. Sometimes finding items can be a little hard. Most of the powers seem to be useless except in certain contextual areas.  Game looks okay. Fun to play.  I'd get it on sale but I'd get every game on sale. It's definetely unique, so if you are into puzzle games and want something different, buy it. It's better than the sequel.
182	0	a	  While the premise is interesting, the amount of glitches and the lack of in-game direction leaves an unholy taint not suitable for anyone.
363	1	a	This game isn't an awful game by any means, but it does have some issues in my opinion. The whole 'kill everyone, hail satan' aspect is pretty fun and the murder puzzles are logical but complicated. For each puzzle there is only one solution, you have no room for creativity. Also many of the puzzles require certain objects that aren't very obvious. If you can't remember where something is or you don't know what you need to find, you're screwed until you read or watch a walkthrough. So i wouldn't recommend this game to someone who rages or gets frustrated easily because it will probably be annoying for you. On the other hand, if you enjoy murdering the people who fed and raised you for 6 years of your life (virtualy of course) then you should definitely buy this game. Graphics are nice, fun concept and Satan is involved soooo buy it
365	1	a	Quite an entertaining game. Would certainly recommend if found in a bundle or on sale. Puzzles and gameplay are fairly simplistic, but the entertainment for me came from the darkness of it. You are running around as an evil child...  For achievement hunters: Easy 100%. A small guide or couple of play throughs with plenty of exploration is needed. A full play through doesn't take many hours.
186	0	a	At first when I played this game I thought it was going to be some fun little satan goes on a rampage sandbox.  Sadly, it's not.  This game is really just a lot of searching for objects and occasionally doing some optional side quests. The cutscenes are alright but it's not as fun as I thought it would be. However, I will admit that Lucius has a great walk.   Would I recommend it? Not at the full price. If you get a good sale on it, knock yourself out then, but don't expect too much out of it.
367	1	a	While the premise for Lucius is full of promise and a refreshing take on horror, Lucius spends more time aggravating than rewarding you with some truly nagging nuisances, questionable execution, and general inconsistencies. You play Lucius, a formidable six year-old child. Born on the 6th of June, 1966 (you can do the conversion), Lucius has the honor of being the anti-Christ and all the light-hearted responsibilities that come with it. Visited by his dad on Birthday number six, Lucius is tasked with carrying out the whims of his father: murdering all the inhabitants of Dante Manor.  The game is comprised of nine separate chapters. Each begins with a voice-over and a notebook entry on who your next target is, and concludes with a grisly homicide and a follow-up visit from Satan to grant Lucius new powers and to bolster old ones, such as telekinesis, combustion, and mind-control. While many of the kills are creative, entertaining, and sometimes morbidly funny, what the game often requires of you to reach that moment of satisfaction often results in frustration.  As an anti-hero six-year-old Satan spawn, you’re quite the amalgam of bad-♥♥♥ and unsuspected hitman – but without much motive or directive. Each kill requires you to piece together sporadic clues to determine what items or tools are necessary to manipulate your target or lure them into places they might not otherwise go (such as face-first into a stove top element to light a cigarette).  For those who enjoy all aspects of the discovery process, clicking around in different environments and ultimately finding what you’re looking for can be rewarding – although the emotion I frequently experienced was exasperation. With little feedback that you’re on the right course, the game can quickly stop being fun. Because of each mission’s strict requirements, the intended payoffs act more as a relief to pent-up frustration for finally getting it right. There was nothing more disappointing than going into the kitchen and being unable to pick up the butcher knife. The mission requirements are often unclear, as almost the entire mansion is free to roam from murder one. Further, there is no initial tutorial on the sequential nature of your murderous imperatives, so you’ll need to start clicking early, often, and indiscriminately. Where the frustration often comes in is when you’re desperately trying to find the next required item to trigger the next scripted sequence or dialogue, so you can in turn use that clue to get down to business. The Manor is highly-detailed, huge and pretty much unrestricted in accessibility from the beginning. This gives you room to explore, but sometimes finding the necessary tools necessitates a click-fest of drawers, cabinets, and items lying around, until you find what you need. The game is plagued with some annoying glitches, clipping problems and hit detection, breaking the flow of the narrative (like characters getting stuck, objects flying around mysteriously and unpredictably after manipulating them, or the camera auto-moving to a 1st-person perspective when near a wall, which is quite jarring).  Graphically, the game isn’t ugly, but a lot of the colors are washed out, the lighting is unrealistic and interferes with other sources (like the outside light interacting with ambient light), and the animations are jerky. The cutscenes are entertaining but suffer from poor camera placement and direction. Subtracting from the presentation are the unacceptably long load times. This compounds frustration when occasionally you’ll fail a mission because someone may have seen you wielding a screwdriver that you had no business wielding, or overtly using your telekinesis, drawing attention from those around. There are no waypoints, so if you fail, you’re back at the beginning, but first you’ll be staring at a load screen.  The in-game music features some fun, weird, bugle-filled atmospheric tracks, sometimes employing the cellos, violin crescendos, and orchestral choirs that are common of the horror genre. Sadly, the music is often on short loops, and can get annoying or simply feel out of place during parts of the chapters. Speaking about out of place, the game’s voice acting is B-rate at best, suffering at times from a poorly-translated script and inadequate direction. This was especially disappointing due to the game being heavily story-driven and reliant on verbal or conversational cues that felt detached.  Despite the game’s ambitious premise, its many shortfalls overshadow the things it actually does well. The murders are always a treat. Coupled with Lucius’ deadpan death-stare and the ludicrously lavish and ridiculous ways in which targets reach their bloody ends, there is often a sick, dark humor that pervades the game. This is also apparent among the surviving residents and workers as they’re picked off one by one, slowly slipping into depression or insanity, and little Lucius just stands there, taking in all the madness, while still conducting his everyday business of putting away his toys and brushing his teeth (these are sadly further nuisances – chores – that break up the narrative but add to the hilarity). The entire game takes place at Dante Manor, an enormous, sprawling estate with dozens of rooms to explore, drawers to rifle through, and objects to steal for your nefarious ends. While the ultimate demise of each target is often original and unpredictable, reaching that moment typically mimics a “Take object A to manipulate object B to get target C to do task D. As such, there is little freedom in getting to the end result. This is not a sandbox game and does not follow the open-ended format of, for example, the Hitman and Manhunt series – but that difference isn’t necessarily a flaw, as it serves a purpose by bolstering the narrative.  Lucius can be engrossing, charming, and even darkly funny. Sadly, the game is bogged down by its poor execution, inconsistent atmosphere, buggy levels, and monotonous mission objectives. If you enjoyed The Omen series (which this game generously borrows from), then you might find something to like in Lucius. Its unsatisfying ending, that despite leaving many questions unanswered, at least leaves the option open for a sequel that is perhaps more refined, tighter, and better-executed. 6/10
369	1	a	The puzzles can be really irrationaI. The delivery isn't fluent, a lot of switches between tutorials, missions and story elements. I hope Lucius 2 is better. Still recommending it for its pricing, idea and originality. No regrets.
187	0	a	  I spent almost the entirety of my time playing this with no idea where to go, not because I wasn't sure how to complete the objective, but because the design of the house in this game is abysmal and the map is useless because half the time it doesn't have any markers. When I was where I was supposed to be and completing the objectives this game was fun, but those times are few and far between with all of the monotonous searching around this terrible house
371	1	a	This is a brutally dark and amazing game. If you really believe you are Lucius, the 6yr old spawn of satan, than you really understand how twisted and psychologically messed up this game truly is and you can really admire its beauty.  Pros: ~You are the 6yr old spawn of satan called Lucius. The story is quite intriguing because of this. ~It is challenging because there are unique (though linear) ways to complete objectives. ~The magical abilities are a nice added touch because the player does not feel like a normal 6yr child. ~Great narrative during cutscenes. Its very interesting to hear a different perspective on the events taking place. ~Relatively short game. 15-20hrs one walkthrough. But if you REALLY like the story/game you want MOAR! ~Realistc. In the sense that, the people in the home, act like theyre just living in a home and do random house things.   Cons:  ~ number one con. The game is too short. Simple 15-20hrs to complete (maybe shorter) but youre left wanting more. ~Sometimes the objectives are confusing. You have to complete objectives in a specific way which might not be obvious. ~You end up running into walls ..... A lot..... (ps. Hold shift to run. I didnt know this and spent at least half of the game walking at slow human child speed) ~The character models aren't top notch. They dont look realistic. This doesnt bother me but it might bother others. ~Controls are bothersome when first learning how to use abilities.  ~Telekinises needs work, levaiting and placing objects is just messy but can be overlooked because its not used often. ~ Cutscenes. A lot of cutscenes. You dont like cutscenes? you might not like this. You like cutscenes? ignore this con.  PS: Don't Agree with me if you have played the game? THATS FINE!!  EVERY GAMER experiences one game differently regardless if your a twin, a quadruplet, a lover of all games etc etc. Agree to Disagree. I listed what might be noticeable cons to the game but THAT DOES NOT MEAN that the game is horrifically bad, EVERY game has AT LEAST one good aspect to it, even if its not obvious.
373	1	a	Quite an entertaining game. Would certainly recommend if found in a bundle or on sale.  Puzzles and gameplay are fairly simplistic, but the entertainment for me came from the darkness of it. You are running around as an evil child...
375	1	a	★★★★☆ - 'Worth your time, give it a bash'  PROS: -Playing as a villian is great fun, especially the spawn of satan. -Killing people in various ways has never been as enjoyable as it is in Lucius, almost hitman like. -This game is funny, mainy due to its faults but Lucius does not take itself seriously at all. -You have to use your innotive, the game does not tell you where to go, instead you must listen carefully and pay attention to your notes. Getting used to the map is also crucial as the house is big! - Although the story is corny and a little far fetched it worked and it was just like a tacky horror movie. - Fun achievements, the type that make you want to go back and play certain missions again.  CONS: - Its unpolished for sure, I dont really mind it as it played into the games enjoyable charm but animations are poor and controls are clunky. - Grapically the game is not brilliant  VERDICT?  An entirely daft premise and not exactly good delivery but the game is somehow one the most enjoyable ive played, which is worrying cause you play as a serial killer.
377	1	a	Good game  Check out my video guides if you need any help with achievements.
379	1	a	Fairly short game but it's fun, the achievements are easy and the story's good
190	0	a	An interesting game by a studio that dared to try something different. The final result is a rather linear, buggy experience that mostly has you running around a huge mansion hunting for clues or interactable objects that have to do with your current target. You'll mostly end up finding items you will need in later chapters, but you get to keep the items for later anyway. This makes the later killings much easier than the earlier ones, since you almost always already have a clue as to how you can use items A or B that your found 2 hours earlier for this. Not all solutions are particularly straightforward. Sometimes the clue you need is dropped in a single line at the start of a cutscene and is then never repeated again. ('Fetch us some [X] and turn on the [Z]!') Other times characters will not shut up and will give you one hint after the other. ('There's a CRUCIFIX in our BATHROOM!' *wink wink*)  The game is strongest about halfway through, when you've gotten used to the controls and the layout of the manor, and you're starting to experiment with your new powers. The later kills and especially the finale involve some sort of time pressure element, which was very unwelcome.  The finale itself is a buggy mess. The game crashed twice and bugged out three other times during the final 5 minutes of gameplay, all at seperate unrelated moments.  It's nice that you got to choose from two different finales, though (action or puzzle), but in the end neither was much of an enjoyment.  Get this game on sale only if you think you'd enjoy playing the antichrist riding around a giant manor on your tricycle, mostly hunting for clues and objects. Otherwise, don't bother.
191	0	a	Total disappointment. Graphics look great, nice evil story. Gameplay is tedious, annoying, and a waste of time.  How to play (spoilers?): run around a house. Your mom tells you to clean your room. You clean your room. She gives you another chore. Other people give you stupid fetch quests. You run around picking up clothes, or looking for a bottle of wine. You gather an assortment of random objects and you try to figure out what to do with them. And, it only saves when you kill someone. So, if you run around doing stupid chores for an hour, then you have to quit ... well the next time you play, better get ready to do chores again. (I thought people played games to escape the boredom of everyday-life activities like chores ...) You get clues which are useless - 'I should mess with this charcter'. You then proceed to try every item in your inventory to 'mess' with him, with no luck.  The killing isn't clever or fun. It's not like you have a number of choices, and you choose how and when to kill certain people. You have to kill a certain person on a certain day in a certain way using certain objects in the correct order. Don't be fooled by the beautiful packaging - it is tedious and annoying.
381	1	a	If only my father was the Devil.
383	1	a	Lucius was born on the June 6th, 1966 and he was just a regular boy until his 6th birthday, when his true identity was revealed by his true father, Lucifer who instructed Lucius to orcastrate the deaths of the mansion's residents without anyone suspecting him, granting Lucius supernatural powers as he succeeds. The concept is interesting, the graphics and soundtrack are quite good, the gameplay is great and the story is intriguing. Despite all the controversy surrounding this game for obvious reasons, I still recommend it.
385	1	a	Lucifer's son. What a lovely boy.
387	1	a	Lucius is the son of the big red guy with the horns who wants souls,. In order to get supernatural powers he must orcastrate “accidents without anyone suspecting him..
389	1	a	LUCIUS REWIEW -Lucius The Son of Lucifer-  Yea almost everyone knows this game this kid born in a day called with 6-6-6 numbers Lucius meets with Lucifer in his 6th BirthDay and he is a bad boy after that day -What is our mission in this game? We are playing this game for finish story mode with trying to kill people with useful equipments and with our demonic powers -Graphics are not that great but when you are in the game Game's Story will help you to forget about graphics while playing   -So is it worth to buy it? Yes For SinglePlayer Story Lovers
192	0	a	Even though I got this at a 90% discount ($1.99), I was still left with a bad taste in my mouth, and wouldn't recommend it even at that price.  There's so much potential here, but the whole experience was messed up by frequent bugs and poor design choices. I'm normally very forgiving of bugs in games, but so many of these seemed like easy fixes that I felt like the product was rushed or lazily made.  The theme and enviornments are fun, as are the sidequests, but there are odd floating objects, crashes to desktop, and puzzle/action sequences that are extremely unguided and frustrating. Some puzzles are so counter-intuitive that you will either need to look up a guide or try to brute-force through a puzzle by 'pixelhunting' for the item you need to interact with. Probably half my playtime was spent being stuck, and when I finally found the answer it wasn't one of those 'DUH' moments, but rather 'that wasn't clear at all!'. The end sequence is so frustrating that I had absolutely no satisfaction from beating it, and was glad it was over.  A little more bugfixing and polish would have gone a LONG way here.  Can I get my $2 back?  Also, the acheivements are terrible! 40 hours playing this? Yeah right!
391	1	a	If you enjoyed the movie The Omen you'll enjoy this game. It's a linear story game with objectives and side objectives to complete. The Side objectives are completely optional unless you wanna nab all those achievos. The collision with objects can be a little wonky (your telekenesis tends to make items flail at lightspeed which is bad when you need to move items to a specific area) and the collection of items required for missions is cryptic. My biggest complaint would be for one mission where you have to place an object in a VERY specific spot to trigger the event. I won't say which one specifically but I was running around the yard for like 15 minutes trying to find this damn spot. Other than that (and getting stuck in a coffee table) it's a pretty fun game!
393	1	a	If you want a game about murdering your family then this game is for you. Its a unique game I suppose although it is very rough. The narrative is good but its not great because you can't turn of subtitles and the voice actors are not that great. The murders are good but sometimes they don't always make sense. Sometimes their straightforward and you have no problems. Other times you can't figure them out and your forced to use a walkthrough. A shame the sequel to this game didn't turn out. This game could really use a re do to make better graphics and more lines of dialogue with better voice actors. Still, its good for 8 hours of fun.
395	1	a	It's so fun to kill and manipulate people who love you.. oh, jeez
397	1	a	Let's be as clear as we can about a few things up front: Lucius is not the best designed game. Its puzzles are often meant to be solved by sending you on a linear path from clue to clue, but that path can be broken by the fact that it's a fairly open world. An NPC might send you to a specific room and the game might expect that you pick up a certain item from it and infer from context that it's to be used in this chapter. But if you picked that item up 5 chapters ago, you might be struggling to make that connection, and instead scour the room for ways to use any of its other set pieces. Some mechanics are clumsy, there's a bit of pixel hunting, and the logic stringing puzzles together can be weird and opaque. You should play the game with another person or a guide to help hammer through it.  All that said, Lucius is pretty fun. For all its kludginess and opacity, it still lets you murder everyone in the house in exchange for rad powers from Satan, and there's a simple joy in running throughout the mansion inverting all the crosses so you can live like a tr00 kvlt six-year-old of the bitter frozen necrofrost. If only you could wear corpse-paint like the band Immortal to let the normals know where you stand.
399	1	a	In this game your the Antichrist!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Gameplay 6/10 creative ways to kill people but it doesnt give u almost any information to help u so use google story is decent 7/10 achievements 10/10 loved it made me laugh . Music 8/10 creepy :D  Overall 7/10 this game has its flaws but its a good game   
401	1	a	Playing as the six year old son of the Devil (like in The Omen) was really fun. Similar to Hitman: Blood Money, the levels are big and the objective is to find ways to kill your target. Unlike Hitman, you can't just pull out a gun and kill them if you can't figure out a way to stealth it, making it more of a puzzle game than an action game.  The deaths are all amusingly gruesome, with good graphics and a soundtrack that sounds like Danny Elfman. It's a bit buggy but the missions are short so restarting them due to a glitch isn't a big deal.
403	1	a	Awesome way to kill people. The story is common (horror movie and ♥♥♥♥) but the gameplay is somehow, really good. You'll love your Uncle's perversion and be really HAPPY to kill your family and... servants. Just try it, it's really fun!
405	1	a	EDIT REVIEW:  Ok.. well there is now an auto save and a save after every chapter. So yeah... this game is excellent. After about 10 minutes, you get used to the controls and then the story captivates you. Played this game at one time. The game makes you think as you try to solve the puzzles to murder all the people in your house. What more could you want?  Oh and the ending... I won't spoil it... but it's great to see this type of ending.!!      ORIGINAL REVIEW: As much as I want to like and play this game, I don't. The story is good, but the controls are a little tricky to get used too. The worst part..? There is no option to save. So you will get so far and have to go for whatever reason, but your game hasn't saved so you can only start from the start again... No thanks. Fix this and I will play it again.
196	0	a	Great in concept, absolutely indescribably terrible in execution.
197	0	a	I bought the game with high expectations, yet Lucius couldn't cover them.   Cons:  It's literally a puzzle game, but a boring one. Disappointing ending.  Bad story line. Makes you just want to get over with it.  Pros: Lucius' face expression.
407	1	a	D:  Well it started like this :I the middle was like this :O the ending was D:
409	1	a	Lucius is a game that you want to play only one time. It's a simple and lineal game in which you play a rol as a rich child with supernatural skills solving simple puzzles and killing people without leaving a single footprint. It also have 'Stealth missions' that you will hate because it's SO BUGGED that sometimes, some people can see you backwards or through walls. A couple of mission's hints are not quite clear enough to the player, so maybe sometimes you'll need to roam around the mansion trying to see what you need to do.  Pros:  + Great Idea of the game + Barely funny + Free movement + Open world (Mansion in this case) + Nice skills  Cons:  - A lot a bugs (Example: the stairs and the tricycle are not very compatible) - Bad face factions - Sequence repetitions (Those guys in the garage with the same music and the same conversation everytime) - Exaggerated ragdoll functions (See what happens when you shoot someone with the gun) - 6 Hour duration average - 2 unneccessary achievements: play 20 hours and 40 hours - You cannot do anything but the quests - When you finish the game, the only thing you can do is just start it over again - WTF final  My score is 6/10
411	1	a	First off, let me start with who I am. I'm a rare bird in the gaming world being a middle aged female with a career and the usual middle age responsibilities. This lends me to games which don't require hours of controller practice, though there is the occassional first person shooter I enjoy, eg, Red Dead Redemption.   Lucius is an adventure game of the Myst genre with well integrated puzzles to solve but no real controller work. The puzzles are a bit too easy. I didn't have to look for a Lucius wiki. I'd give the storytelling a B+. It's a decent game to play on a slow weekend. It won't take much longer. The steam price is appropriate for this game. Worth playing but I wouldn't have been happy with it if I bought it at it's original retail price, just not much depth.
413	1	a	Can totally tell they made a big effort with this game, but only really worth it on sale.  Awesome ideas, they just haven't been executed to their full potential.  The creativity going into this game is amazing but it feels like they poured all of their attention into the concepts and then gave up half-way trying to put them into a game whole-heartedly.  It's still a good game, it can get so boring wandering around a mansion, which is easy to get lost in. (And pick up literally everything that you find, it'll come in useful later and saves running around looking for it.) Perfect for people who like to think outside the box, or people who just enjoy murder. 6/10 would devil again 
415	1	a	nice game. i want the 2nd.  edit: omg they are doing it !
417	1	a	I love this game, it's so evil! If u like horror movies u will like it. The story is based off of The Omen.

421	1	a	Although Its Very Glitching, It Was Really Fun In The End. I Loved The Brutal Ways The People Died. Even Though, It Was Sorta Perverted, It Was All Equally Funny. :3
423	1	a	This title quickly rocketed up to one of my favorite games of the last decade; it’s not flawless, it’s not a blockbuster or a triple A spectacle, but Lucius is exceptionally different, well executed and darkly captivating. I feel that it’s fair to assume that revealing your character to be an evil, twisted little demon child does not merit a spoiler warning. Lucius (even his name is evil) is an extremely rare phenomena of a character; even though he is the main character and you play as him, he is the single most horrifying part of playing this game. Obviously there are no jump scares since you are the one in control of him, but what is terrifying is how easily this fictional child brings out this dark evil personality from the player. The core of the game is a point and click murder mystery with the awesome twist that you’re the “bad guy and your goal is to not get caught. The mansion that the story takes place in is a bit confusing when you first started, and the map is pretty unexceptional, but after the first couple chapters you’ll quickly get a hang of how it’s all laid out. Some of the optional quest objectives can be a bit tedious but the main missions are relatively easy to work your way through without feeling hopelessly stuck. The atmosphere is perfect, starting out peaceful and opulent then progressively sliding into emotional turmoil and fear. Lucius is absolutely incredible and I would recommend it to anyone.
425	1	a	Free the demon inside you and fulfill your destiny as the Devil's champion in this bloodchilling thriller game. Taking a part in a series of murders, player controls Lucius - a child... that kills.  The game's concept itself could be considered as something we have not yet seen (at least, at this large scale) in games generally. You play as a little boy who is not what he seems to be. Gameplay basically is similar to  Hitman  franchise, but it's not the same thing as you do all these bloody deeds with the child's hands (and his devil mind).  I give this game a high mark as it was a great experience and I have completed the game in a single day (evening and night, to be precise) because I couldn't have stopped once I've started.  ...Oh, one more important thing. it's not a game for kids!!! Even while main character is a kid, the game is violent and intense in some manner, so keep your kids off the screen! I'm serious!

431	1	a	Lucius lets you play as the titular 7 years old Antichrist, you'll be killing a whole mansion just to appease Satan: while as fun as it sounds sadly the experience is marred by quite a few problems.   PROS:   -great soundtrack sets the tone for the game  -gory kills  -you'll develop some fairly interesting powers  -an expansive mansion for you to explore  -being a 7yo murdering spawn of Satan is surely fun   NEUTRAL:   -the game is VERY bleak, you're murdering/framing innocents and there's no sense of humour whatsoever to balance things: so I guess such a dreary game isn't for everyone   CONS:   -sadly there's only one way to kill your inteded victims, this makes the game experience quite restrictive  -some of the objects needed are small and/or stuck in hard to find places, keep a guide handy if you get frustrated  -stealth sections can get annoying  -clunky inventory  -no controller support  -repetitive npc speech  -last boss battle feels pretty silly   http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=457387627   While Lucius might look like an Hitman clone the restrictions put on who/how to kill and the object hunts required to find the items you need makes it game more of a puzzle game than anything else: it's quite hard to shake the feeling that the whole gaming experience is fairly limited and that it'd have been so much more. Still, if you can deal with the limits the game puts on you and do not get too frustrated by the pixel hunts it can provide a few pleasant hours as you try to figure out what to do and enjoy the bloody results of your labor: just get it on sale when it drops under the 2$ mark.
433	1	a	Great little game.  Its not that long, but it defo makes up for length in atmosphere. I would bet my manhood that the devs are fans of the Omen....  For £1, you cannot go wrong here!
435	1	a	This game is pretty cool, funny to play, even if you will dafinetely need a guide to finish it. But seriously what are that achievements? 20h and 40h for a 7-8 hours game is insane. Maybe if there were more ways to kill or idk, multiple versions of the campaign. Anyway, buy the game, it is good.
437	1	a	Always wanted to be the little ♥♥♥♥ that you know you were, but didn't want the ♥♥♥ whooping if your parents found out? Well this game is for you; going around offing people you don't like or just anyone in general. As the spawn of Lucifer you go around murdering people to send their souls to him.   That's basically it; however the game doesn't hold your hand, even if your stuck on a certain part and have no idea what to do, the game will not give a hint even after 10 minutes. This is where my frustrations lie; I don't want to be going around looking at every little thing that I might be able to use. Even though I game a lot I still consider myself to be a casual gamer, as I don't want to tediously do things such as look around for things to contaminate for example: I knew I had to poison someone and went into the kitchen and couldn't find anything resembling a platter to contaminate. I went onto Youtube and found that it was a basket I had to infect. Keep in mind that this is a rich family and the maid who took the food to the person always had a platter for her!   If you have patience and can get into these kind of games I would recommend it.
439	1	a	6 year old kid killing his whole family for the glory of Satan. And you are that kid armed with demonic power. Each murder has to look like accident so they wont throw your ♥♥♥ in asylum, or yet worse, catholic church. The concept actually sounds better than actual gameplay looks like, but it is worth trying.
198	0	a	When I first time entered this game,I was like 'Wow,I'm a little boy who is possessed by the Satan! Wow,look I can make fire and move things! Wow,graphics are so dark and atmospheric!' But then the game started. You wanted to murder people? No,you will do it when we tell you. You wanted to use superpowers? How dare you?! It's only for cutscenes! You wanted to have fun? Huh,so naif. The story is good but gameplay is monotous and boring. 5.5/10
441	1	a	Great game, completed it in 1 day.
199	0	a	Lucius is one of those games that has a very interesting idea, but executes it horribly. This game sounded like it was going to be waaay more fun then it turned out to be.   I can't say much about Lucius, because as you can see I only have about an hour of playtime on record. I didn't choose to only play an hour, the game is just so buggy that I couldn't manage to get any farther. Half of the time I can't play because it glitches so much.   On top of all that, the whole game is very linear. The entire gameplay consist of finding the item you are supposed to find and then using it on the objective. (ex: find screwdriver click stove, wait. Find lock, click freezer, wait.) There are no paths to branch onto, and no choices the come with the game. You have to do what the game wants you to do, and you have no free will to decide yourself. The most side missions you can do is to do your chores for money.That usually involves picking up blocks and putting them in a chest.  Even the powers in Lucius cannot be used freely. Towards the beginning of the game you are granted different powers. Sounds cool right? Not really... You are told when to use that power and you can't use it any other time then when you are prompted to. With how buggy the game is too, the powers can be a hassle to use.   Another problem with Lucius is the voice acting. It's... pretty bad. Also Lucius himself lacks character. He doesn't show emotion, change his facial expression, say anything, or do anything to show that he is a character. Sure, he is possessed, but that's no excuse. I'd rather him do a cheesy evil grin then be a walking cardboard that is there to do one objective to the next.   I may have only stated negative things about Lucius this whole review, but I will say that it could be worth it if hugely discounted or in a cheap bundle. The story can be somewhat interesting and the deaths are great to watch for the sadistic side that we all have. It's not a horrible game, but it's definitely not worth the $10 price tag. Especially with how buggy it can be. I say pick Lucius up on sale ONLY if you like very linear storytelling. Oh, and also pull up a walkthrough because the game is almost impossible to figure out without one.
443	1	a	The next time you go to church and the preacher tells you that video games are evil, you can look him in the eye and tell him.......er....uh......Well, since this game's release, there's really no good counter argument. LOL Yep, in this game you play as the son of the devil. It is heavily influnced by the 1976 classic 'Omen,' and that honestly is the only thing that initially attracted me to this game. It's a third person mystery/adventure game where you explore a huge mansion and find creative ways to kill off the help. You do not play a hero. If this game has any heros at all, it's the detective and your clueless parents. The chapters of the game are divided into each person you kill, and with each murder, your satanic powers are increased. You get such skills as mind control, combustion, and memory erase. You can move things with your mind and set people on fire, but you can't be seen because you don't want to draw suspicion. The story is progressed through very good cutscenes told between chapters and the game has a lot of atmosphere. The story reaches it's climax during a very cool exorcism scene, but man I've never played a game where I wanted the character I play as to loose so bad. It's a very interesting twist that honestly, I wasn't totally comfortable with. But it was original, unique, and very interesting, with great controls and a neat open world mansion to explore. So if you don't mind taking the role of a devil child and knocking off helpless people for Satan, this might be your cup of tea. BWAHAHAHAHAHAAA!!
200	0	a	I love the concept and story. But sadly the painfully linear game play and cut-scenes (seemingly every time I take a few steps) make it utterly impossible to immerse myself.   There is literally only one way to kill each target, and the game makes it perfectly unclear on what you're supposed to do. This ultimately leads you to Google the solution, at which point any amount of enjoyment flies out the window.  Here is my playthrough of the first hour of the game via my Youtube Channel:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwjnW0NjZ6o 
445	1	a	6/66  
447	1	a	  Become the son of the devil and be his deadly weapon in this interesting graphic adventure that reminds us of classic horror movies such as The Prophecy or Rosemary's Baby. Innocent, formal, introvert... but also cruel, machiavellian and very powerful. Lucius has proposed himself to satisfy his father's needs by offering him a true blood bath.     LONG VERSION
202	0	a	Very slow and annoying that you cant skip a lot of the cut scenes. I am not very far into the game but after your first achivemnt it stops giving you hints on how to kill the person and you have to figure out random stuff. Like killing Gene, the map tells you to go straight to where Gene is but first you have to stop and get the screw driver from the other guy, but to figure that out I actually had to look it up online. Not much fun and very slow
203	0	a	I went into this hearing all positive reviews on gamesites, raving videos about it &amp; thought it would be good. It started off &amp; was decent, third person sandbox game in a limited environment, a focus on solving puzzles &amp; murder, playing as son of the devil. Oh how I was wrong.  After the first 2 or so murders though all novelty started to run thin, a character would say something in passing to satan-child, devil tells you to get souls, proceed to go through specific path to kill the person. On the way you can do various chores with your powers, pick up blocks with telekinesis, steal underwear from a maids room to wash it etc.   Graphics were decent, better than I expected but not amazing. The story was interesting to start but became boring fast, not as fast as the story decayed though. I won't spoil but by the end it just decided to wrap things up too rushed &amp; uninterestingly, while hinting at a sequel I hope won't come. About half way through it just became a chore to play, there's no way I'm even going to bother with the achievements I haven't got.  Although I hate comparisons, some people like them so here we go. With the (very) limited sandbox &amp; single choice murders, you could mistake it for a portable version of Assassins Creed. Happy? No, nor am I as that was a bad comparison but the game made me unhappy I bothered with it, so get used to the disappointment if you're going to buy it.   Cons:  -Limited interactivity with game world -Poor controls -Poor story -Bland gameplay -Too scripted (might just be me, prefer choices &amp; options in a game like this) -Over the top murders, we're talking the sort little Timmy dreams up only to find his mum being called in by the teacher to send him to psychiatric help, all the while imagining all the ways they could both meet a gruesome fate -Bad ending -No replay value at all, unless you want achievements -Nudity used 50% through to try &amp; entice the player -Everything else in the game -The price, $20 is WAY too much for it, I'd even say the $5 I paid for a bundle with it was too much. If you see it at $2, grab it &amp; be numbed for 5 hours  Pros -Graphics ok for indie game -Powers were cool, not enough to do with them -Good concept  So the tl;dr, interesting concept, really poor execution. If you're swayed by nudity, you can peek on a maid, if you want a decent game then go elsewhere. Maybe if you're 10-16 this will be good, otherwise it's too...forced feeling.
449	1	a	If you like puzzle games and you wanna be the bad guy for once, get that game ! I really enjoyed it and I strongly recommend it. Although it's a little bit short (6 hours for me), it's totally worth it to get it, at least on sale if not for the full price. Enjoy being mean...
451	1	a	Haven't even finished it yet, and I'm in love. Pretty f***** up game and the story is decent. You play a six year old who murders everyone in his house because the Devil wants their souls. How much better can it get?   Ran into two bugs. A few lighting issues where it looks like the light from a flashlight is coming out of an NPC's face (happened on two separate occasions), and a bug with Will in the garage. (Spoiler Alert?) DO NOT MAKE HIM INTERACT WITH THE RAG. He will start walking in place, and then you need to start the chapter over.   It's unique and genuinely entertaining, and the gameplay and environment make you WANT to explore. Meaning you don't get really annoyed when you need to figure out what to do next.   I'd give it an honest 10/10.
453	1	a	Hey and this is my review about this game.  It is a demonic game. You play as a kid and follow orders from the devil to kill people.  he has to kill an order of people in the most craziest way ever. Animations can sometimes be funky. You have to do something first before the person will die. Sometimes u have to do some side tasks to be 'a good boy' which will unlock other things. You have to explore around and collect some items. The music is very well done too! You can have mulitple profiles.  You CAN'T play with the controller, which is a shame. Because their is potential for it.  Let's Try Video:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq5Ne0fEG4Y  Let's Play Video:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67ocOvAhfGQ   The game is quite interesting. i do not want to spoil it but i give the game 8/10
204	0	a	This game is too cryptic not to have a save system of some kind (either checkpoints or manual saves). If you fail certain sequences you have to start all over again from the beginning of the chapter. After the first few missions it becomes nearly impossible to figure out what you have to do to eliminate a target.

457	1	a	9/10
459	1	a	You are Lucius, you are the anti christ, you are death.  Play as a small quiet child named Lucius, born to a rich senator and a loving mother. You live in a large mansion, with maids and butlers that make your life easier.. in different ways than intended.  Normally maids and people of service are there to clean or fix, or even get you things when you are too lazy to grab them yourself. Not for Lucius, these servants are souls waiting to be reaped for the hellfire home you call hell.  But of course you are just a child with weak powers, you can not just reveal yourself, that would mean certain death and prolong the rebirth. No, you will do this silently and as if accidents have befallen your estate. What better way to absorb the poor souls of innocent men and woman then by 'accidently' killing them?  The gameplay isnt very linear sometimes, so that can be frustrating for some people, me included. I found myself looking at guides to find certain items or to find out where I need to go next. The mansion you are living in is also massive and complicated at first, really confusing you more than needed.   The deaths are fun, giving a sense of accomplishment when you kill someone.   You can break stuff, mind control people, erase their minds, use your mind to move objects and burn people alive.   About 5 hours of gameplay if you play it to finish, not including achievements or general exploration.   I'd say give it a shot, and if it gets too complicated or annoying just pull up a guide from the steam overlay or on your phone for ease of access.  Personal Rating: 3.5/5
461	1	a	Lucius is a funny little game with a great concept. Both the visuals and voice acting are surprisingly good for this kind of game. The story and characters are alright and it is beyond charming riding around a tricycle in your fathers mansion plotting a sinister murder. The execution isn't perfect though. The point and click adventure style part of the game works for the most time alright however there are some far fetched puzzles and some annoying item searching in there. There are also some stealth missions in the game which would work surprisingly fine if the game didnt restart the entire map every time you got caught. This dumb save-system drags down every single part of the game but it is especially noticeable in the stealth missions. There are also some action-based missions in the game which are quite awful. I would still recommend the game to anyone interested despite its flaws simply because its concept is so unique and entertaining. So if you find this game available for a cheap price, go for it! It will be an interesting experience no matter what !!!
205	0	a	This is one of the worst games I have ever played. If you like context dependent 'find the magic pixel' games wearing the disguise of a puzzle/stealth game then this is perfect for you. WHO WAS THIS MADE FOR? Omen fans? Were people really clamoring for ♥♥♥♥♥♥ controls and contrived plots? How about broken stealth segments that rely on repetition with little to no indication of where enemies are? I can not emphasise enough how terrible this game is.  You play Lucius, the antichrist born through the machinations of your grandfather who made a pact with the devil to gain power and money. Now you have to go through a mansion and kill people as offerings to Satan in an effort to increase your power. This is done by finding little items hidden throughout the one location in the game and using them to engineer traps or situations that you can influence through your satanic powers that end with someone dying. I guess it's a good game for... snuff enthusists? The payoff to solving the puzzles is a gruesome cutscene sometimes followed by a new power to use that are highly sensitive to context. There's no experimentation, no alternate paths, just a set puzzle with one often obscure conclusion. God help you if you don't know where to get an item that you need to solve a puzzle. It'll usually be tucked away, some colorless chunk on the washed-out palate that you need to click on. Speaking of items, there's an inventory where you store particular items that relate to the story but there's no differentiation between the items you can pick up and the junk that is strewn throughout the house that you can just pick up and HOLD. Sometimes you'll even need to just pick up the items you can't put in your inventory! The house, which is the only setting, is featureless and huge. You can run around up and down stairs, but if you turn a corner too fast or make some minute adjustment with the camera you're going to get lost. Every room and every hallway looks the same, but after about 4 hours of playing I stopped having to refer to the map every 10 seconds.  The characters are all terribly stiff archetypes capering around and delivering lines through terrible voice acting. Not many lines were recorded, so expect to hear repeated dialogue a LOT. Another part of the story is told through what seems to be the diary entries of a detective named 'McGuffin' (hilarious) but I have NO IDEA why these segments were included. Who cares about what some detective is doing when that isn't the focus of the game at all? Why make that a thing? There's no mystery being solved for the player. You know EXACTLY what's happening because the 10 minute intro sequence spelled everything out for you. No tension is built through this parallel exposition and no new information is gained. It just turns into a boring sequence of people jabbering at each other, faking emotion while delivering tired and predictable lines that usually pan out like this: 'I'm a detective who can't figure out why people keep killing themselves.' 'Something weird is going on and the my upcoming election can't handle the scandal if the public gets wind of all these people killing themselves in my home.' 'I know. It's so WEIRD though.' Now repeat that between every one of the 18 chapters. This game was boring, frustrating, contrived, cheap, brought nothing new to the experience, had shoddy controls, barely any mechanics, and was a genuine pain to play. Don't buy it, don't play it.
206	0	a	This is the plot of the first Omen movie, but then also taking place at a same location as in the second movie, a mansion that is. Even the birthday party is included right at the beginning. So this is simply ''Omen - The game'' (for those who are familiar with it).   Good stuff:  *Assuming it has been well tested or been worked on by great programmers, seeing how I've never experienced a single bug in it myself.   *The atmosphere is probably what holds it up. Like a weak and sole supporting beam. It makes the game enjoyable enough to go on and see what the next death is gonna be like. Built up with the characters in the mansion getting more and more tensed after every accident. But other than that...   Bad stuff experienced (as feedback):  *Graphics are too dark in some areas to make out details.  *Music does not hold enough variety.  *The controls, or specifically in this case, the camera perspective, is working against you when you wish to highlight and interact with objects.  *The Gameplay offers very little to do other than just progressing the story. Apart from being able to acquire three more or less helpful items, after doing minor tasks, there are no side quests at all or alternative paths in the game. This makes it much too linear and thereby cuts it down rather short.  *There is no challenge. The toughest part in the game, is to control the telekinesis with your mouse movement, in order to swing objects at people. That's about it.   Conclusion:  I don't recommend purchasing this for more than 10 Euro/12 Dollar
207	0	a	I was drawn in by the idea to experience a bit of 'The Omen' perhaps, but the execution is poor. Very clucky controls what frustrate at times making it had to naviagate the world or select objects to interact with. The worst is during what was a firey confrontation, I fell through the world as I attempted to turn a cross upside down, only to do it again when I respawned. The third time I passed through a locked door and could not reenter to finish the fight.  Overall, it is very sloppy. The story line was what I expected but after the 11th 'chapter' the initial novelity had worn out.
463	1	a	Atmospheric game.8/10
465	1	a	Killed everyone in the house and still considered a good boy by my satan dad and my mom just for doing chores and just by murdering people     10/10 for parenting
209	0	a	 Check Out my Full Review for Lucius Here!  [uncrownedreview.blogspot.com]   This game is just riddled with problems. It styles itself as a sort of logic puzzle game but the problem is, you don't have half the pieces to the puzzles. You have to find the pieces by trial and error to eventually solve the puzzles and murder your entire household.  Look at my avatar, it's holding an axe. When I successfully use puzzles to murder someone I should be clapping gleefully in a way that makes the FBI agents attached to monitor me feel very uncomfortable. I should not be feeling like my own brain is beginning to melt inside my skull to the point that I actually thought on the level of insanity of the developers.   A walkthrough is pretty much required for this game and I'm told that if you just want the story you can watch a movie called The Omen and save yourself the time. If you can get it on sale for under $5 there are some fun missions that you'll enjoy playing. I don't recommend it for any more than that unless the developers release a major overhaul.
467	1	a	Lucius .. Oh god .. Sorry for playing that game!!  Lucius - Is a son of Satan ! He is supposed to kill every single person alive in the manor he is living : Dad , mom , butcher , maid and etc.  The way Lucius kills everyone reminds me of a movie : Final Destination   EVERYTHING IS JUST COVERED WITH BLOOD!! If it's not , It was probably a poison (Sad Story)  Okay , let me tell you smth. about the plusses of the game :  + You are a son of a Devil !! + You can get a tricycle , so you can cycle around the house !! + Fans of such a great movies like : Saw , Final Destination will love the game for HUGE amount of 'Accidents' + You have super powers + Nudity  Now , minuses :  - ♥♥♥♥ TONS OF ANNOYING BUGS (Starting from a simple AI glitches , finishing with a chance of not getting mission finished) - Animations of the NPC's  - OVERWHELMING BRUTALITY !!!!!!!! - Nudity (Yeah , it is + and - )  Actually , the game is pretty cool ! I can forget about the problems and keep playing the game forever ! Sad thing .. I still need to check 50% of a games on my Steam Libary and CD's 3:   Also , LUCIUS 2 IS WIP!!!! (Guess where the Lucius has been taken :3)
469	1	a	kill kill kill kill with a little boy. HOW AWESOME IS THAT ?!
471	1	a	i liked the game enough to play it through, but it was a very rough cut out of what could have been a great game. the npc's constantly repeat the same things over and over which gets quit irritating. there aren't many clues to go off of so switching between abilities to see what may work as an option is quit frequent and often i needed to resort to youtube for help. the story is pretty bad in script and logic. however i will still give it a thumbs up because it was everything that i expected to be which was a low budget b film video game take on the movie 'the omen'. my final words on it is 'to get it on discount'.
473	1	a	this game really grows on you. really interesting and i recommend it
475	1	a	WOW. Great game.  666/666
477	1	a	I got this game when It was on sale for 99 cents, And It was worth it. It's very neat and interesting, Sure, It may be full of bugs. But I can guarantee that you'll always find your way around them. I would definitely recommend this game.
479	1	a	This game filled with pure evil that I can't manage to handle. Please only try the game if you could consume it... otherwise you end up having a weird nightmare and gonna experience heavy stress-out.  Just sayin'.
481	1	a	Almost good as movie :D 10/10
483	1	a	The House is now 90% crime scene tape :/ and all because Lucius wanted a tricicle
485	1	a	Well I thought it would be a mix of Hitman and King's Shining. But it's not. It's more like point-and-click adventure divided into 18 peices and you have to kill somebody in each piece. Playing as a little boy. You don't have any choices, you just need to figure out the right way and do it. The game has 2 most stupid achievements in the industry: 'play for 20 hours' and 'play for 40 hours'. I mean you can finish the whole game in 10 hours playing very slowly.
487	1	a	9/11 would make me wanna kill my family again
489	1	a	Lucius is a unique game. It is a brilliant puzzle game, figuring out how to use your powers and things around you to kill various people, even having a story that even though not fully compelling is made bareable by the great gameplay. The mansion is a joy to explore and its had top standard gore. If you like challenging puzzle games with a dash of blood, this is the one for you.
491	1	a	I would recommend this game. I like the concept of the game and the story. I think this isn't the kind of game you play for the incredible graphics and the game also has some bugs. But overall it was good fun, I liked the tricycle!
493	1	a	At first i was not impressed with this, then slowly it began to grow on me. I bought this game in promise of a sandbox type serial killer game but this is not the case. Instead the game tasks you to kill specific Help around the house and it is your job to move things around and set up the perfect kill. As far as the sandbox experience goes, you can move seemingly random objects around the house and place them anywhere.  The game places you in the shoes of a seemingly innocent six-year old boy as he is celebrating his sixth birthday. Just so happens that this boy is not your average kid, he happens to be a literal spawn of Satan. Or Lucifer obviously implied by the developers naming the kid 'Lucius'. Lucifer wants souls and it is your job to give it to him. One day every month you are tasked to kill employees and family members who reside within the house. Every kill challenges you with intricate puzzles, easy or not depending on your skill level (I finished the game in seven hours). The story is not ground breaking, just your typical murder mystery manor. But it is pretty amusing to watch the mental health of your family members deteriate as they try to figure out who is commiting the murders. Towards the end, you are given the choice of what type of ending you want. Action or puzzle, given for players who like puzzles or action, or both.  Overall this game is really good and i would definitely recommend this game for my friends.
495	1	a	An amazing concept, a unique idea, greatly executed.  Despite some minor bugs and some aspects that may be updated (such as some collision bugs), Lucius properly mixes and blends together various genre in one product: stealth, point and click, puzzle, crafting, open world in one game.  You play as the six year old Lucius, a kid who literally works for the Devil as his personal cook as your task will be to bring him souls to feed him. In the vast Dante Manor there are many individuals to choose from while keeping the good-boy attitude not to raise suspects. While murdering members of your family and their servants, you will be asked to perform chores like brushing your teeth, tidy up your room, finding objects etc. These chores will slowly award you special objects.  As you kill people, you will strengthen your evil skills and gain new ones.  I will not spoil much of the game itsel as it's a continuous surprise.  My advice is to purchase this genre-defining game!
497	1	a	It's pretty linear, and it's full of bugs. But regardless, I found it to be such a unique game that it didn't matter. It's just one of those diamond in the rough games. If murdering an unsuspecting household one by one as a 6 year old boy riding a tricycle sounds like your kind of day, then definitely check this game out.
499	1	a	666  I enjoyed this game!  + story + cinematics + devil/hell things + you feel like a badass! + two ends   - sometimes glitches - kinda hard puzzles (I used walkthrough)
501	1	a	You control a six year old serial killer with supernatural powers such as, climb the stairs riding a tricycle , getting stuck inside a wall in the closet and many other awesome powers.
503	1	a	Some of us were just made to play as demonic spawn.  The mechanics in Lucius are far from perfect, but the story and aesthetic make up for all that.
505	1	a	I literally just bought the game yesterday and I love it, only wish I have gotten it sooner, but I saw there's a sale and I got it. The puzzles, the story, the graphics, it's like none of the kind you see out there. Please note that this is a very hard and challenging game, but It'll never bore you as you'll continue to explore and test the many missions and mamny charachters.  8.5/10 Would definitely recommend.
507	1	a	Fun and easy achievements. I wouldn't really recommend it if you're looking for a quality game but it occupied me for a while and if you like killing people as a mini-Satan then this game is for you 6/10
509	1	a	I quite enjoy this game because I love horror games. This kid is a badass. It's a skillful game and it makes you think. Def would recommend especially getting 1 and 2 for $5.  7/10
511	1	a	Great games for satanists 7/10 - Would kill entire family again
513	1	a	I completed the game in 3 hours, it was a good and a fun time killing people , of course i had to use tutorials as without them i would be still on first mission haha, maybe next time without them :D
515	1	a	[SPOILER ALERT] I don't know what's going on. I locked someone in a freezer and they froze to death. I spoke with the devil and removed the lock from the freezer. I now have telekinesis. I didn't really need it when I rigged an oven to watch a man's face burn off. Send help.
517	1	a	Cool horor game :(
519	1	a	I can only recommend this game! SO much fun!  - Running around as a 6/7 year old and killing people while making it look like an accident is just awesome! Even tho its a freaking awesome game, i wouldnt pay 20 Euros for it. I waited and got it 66 % off, and that is worth every penny!  Fun-factor: 5 out of 5 ! = Go buy it at a sale!  (A must have in your gaming collection) 
521	1	a	Well this game is one of those buggy/gitchly games but in all it was quite fun you know if being a demon child doing all types of puzzles is your thing
523	1	a	This is a clever concept that falls fairly short in execution. The game mechanics are simple enough, just find the right combination of objects in the correct steps and watch things unfold. The puzzles start out fairly simple, but then start to get to the point of being illogical. There are also numerous graphical glitches (bike doesn't steer, objects floating slightly above shelves, etc.) and the VO is sub-par. Overall though, the game ends up being mischevious fun and looks decent. I would still recommend it.  6.5/10
525	1	a	this game really grows on you. really interesting and i recommend it
527	1	a	This game filled with pure evil that I can't manage to handle. Please only try the game if you could consume it... otherwise you end up having a weird nightmare and gonna experience heavy stress-out.  Just sayin'.
529	1	a	Picked up maids panties, learned how to use a flashlight, killed a maid in a freezer. 10/10 would be antichrist again.
531	1	a	Have you ever wanted to play as a psychotic serial killer child who kills everyone? Well look no further get Lucius the most awesome game ever greated it made me go all WHAT THE ACTUAL Fбать  должен делать...jk the game is actually pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥.  Graphics look like it were pooped straight outta Lucifers butt and sticked together with a ♥♥♥♥♥. Cutscenes are ♥♥♥♥ing terrible because graphics+terrible lip sync(looks like they are saying really SFAHJAIFSHOABDJFOHBDHBFHJSDBHFA).  Still for some reason i had fun with it ;) just wait for a sale tho.   5/10 Devil Tricycles in a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ MEDIOCRE!  Also if you have a under 7 year old sibling i would recommend to check on them and make sure they are not really the Devils son/daughter
533	1	a	A horror game with psycho kid completing hitman list under contract by lucifer massacring people around .
535	1	a	Very good. Play as the spawn of satan, and you kill people. What more do you want?
537	1	a	your father is the devil and you need to murder everyone in your mansion without anyone suspecting you (as if its an accident). fun story, pretty decent graphics for its age/genre. 8/10
539	1	a	This kid Lucius is one sadistic little manipulative ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. A fun dark game out the gate that builds on evil at a consistent rate. Watch for subtle clues and think outside the box when stuck in tasks. This game unlocks that mean little kid that we all have inside and amplifies him x100. Worth a play when it goes on sale.
541	1	a	I completed the game in 3 hours, it was a good and a fun time killing people , of course i had to use tutorials as without them i would be still on first mission haha, maybe next time without them :D
543	1	a	Some of us were just made to play as demonic spawn.  The mechanics in Lucius are far from perfect, but the story and aesthetic make up for all that.
545	1	a	Cool horor game :(
547	1	a	Fun game, you have to love killing people in a dark style or something. Worth my 94 cents xD  Leuk spel, je moet wel van mensen doden in een rare stijl houden ofzo. Het is mijn €0.94 zeker waard xD
549	1	a	Very original game, worth the price and very fun in a sick kind of way!  Could improve with better instructions and tutorial and faster loading!  Overall very cool game! :)
551	1	a	Im thrilled with all of this.... KILLING!! *laughs evilly* WAHHAHAHAHAHHAA
553	1	a	The only thing that was bad was the bugs but the game is still fun. Its like Hitman but Satin Edition
555	1	a	very good but kinda hard to understand what to do next after you have set your target but yeah that's what we have google for.
557	1	a	become mom's favourite kid , made a maid suicide , froze a maid to death , electrocuted a naked maid in bathtub , killed the butcher with his own saw , killed the gardener with land mower , poisoned a pervert , burned a mechanic with gasoline and fire , killed an old man with dagger , made the piano fall on the janitor , made my maths teacher shoot himself , made a man suffocate to death , did eye surgery with water bottle and killed a bartender , lit some priests on fire , burned a guy's face who was trying to light a cigarette , made fan cut the head of a cop .  Yeah im an innocent 10 year old.
559	1	a	First off, .The setting, the story-telling, the opening cinematic -- everything about its thematic texture is just so sadistically appealing. But A nice gameplay though as i am playing it after 3 years of release . Nice Story Cant Stop Playing
561	1	a	Ok, so I usually play console games and have just recently turned to the 'Pc master race' and this is one of the first games I have had to play with keyboard and mouse. The reason I start by saying this is that all I've been seeing, here on steam, is people complaining about the controls. So, how does the game feel is a good question. The answer, to a non-traditional keyboard and mouse player, is pretty well, there are a few moments later in game where I needed to use my right hand to hit number keys as I used my left hand to control movement, but other than that no probs.  Another thing is I see people saying that the game is a buggy piece of bleep, and though that is subjective most people take that as a warning sign. I'm not going to say this game is the most polished thing ever but it sure isn't what people are making it out to be, and I did encounter a few bugs such as my journal not updating halting progress, and I got stuck on some clutter behind the bar. Sure that sounds bad but a simple restart of a checkpoint and you should be good.   Then on to how it looks, and I'm fully aware this is personal opinion but I think this game is stunning, the animations in cinamatics aren't the best but they're on par with some AAA games I've played.   So to story then, I suppose if you couldn't gather this from everything to do with the game you play Lucius a spawn of Lucifer (the Devil) and you're killing everyone, in a Hitman-esq playstyle mixed with evil powers. It's like a mix of the Shining and the Omen, and thats a really good thing. And the game offers alternate endings which all wrap the story up well. Heads up if you are Catholic or Christian and are easily offended you may want to pass on this one.   As my first real pc game I thought this was a very good start, and for the price of 20 bucks I feel (pardon this horrible phrase) that I really got my moneys worth. So check this out guys, ya just might like it!
563	1	a	Cleaned up my toys. Brushed my teeth. killed the guy who was cutting the pork. great simulator if you want to remember what it was like to be 6.
565	1	a	Special thanks to Sudden for buying me this game....anyway on with the review.. It's like if Damien had his very own video game! You take control of this kid that was possessed by some dark shadow ♥♥♥♥ or something idk, BUT, the game picks up when you start killing each of the staff in there one by one. Very fun to see them die knowing you're the little ♥♥♥♥ who started it.
567	1	a	Got into my house and killed my family then I started playing Lucius 10/10 would play again
217	0	a	I suspect that the early plans for Lucius involved dropping the son of Lucifer into a small open world filled with people who need killing and offering multiple ways to perform said kills. After the first couple of more scripted kills would offer a tutorial on how the game's mechanics functioned, Lucius would then be unleashed to study, stalk and ultimately execute each member of the household in whichever order the player wished. Sadly, this isn't the game we get. Instead, the game feels like it was massively scaled back and forced into a different, more linear mold about halfway through production. Instead of building traps, staging 'accidents' or setting people against each other, the player is instead forced to trigger scripted deaths using inventory items and a suite of flimsy magic powers that felt very tacked-on. You kill your targets in the order that is scripted for you and the game will sometimes set everything up so that basically all you need to do is pull the trigger. Yawn. I give Lucius an A- for concept but unfortunately, the execution of concept is equally (or more so) important and that's where Lucius fails. There's still some entertainment to be had during its 5-6 hour campaign and it floods you with achievements for almost no effort, but in the end it falls a little too short for a recommendation.
569	1	a	The game is good as in the gameplay and story. -Achievements are quite easy to obtain except the 'Time' achievements, 'I like this game' and 'I'm addicted' which I get to later. -It's quite linear to say the least.  -There's a side quest to do where you do these chores and you obtain an item when you, I believe, do two or three chores everytime. The most fun in the game was the item that you would get third time, the tricycle. You could literally cycle up the stairs and go faster than walking by pressing 'Shrift' to speed up.  The price to me honestly isn't worth it (18,99€), but I can't complain as I got it in a giveaway. -That being said, the week long deal offers 95% off as of typing this review (30/08/2015) which is a good deal.  Now onto the 'Time' achievements. It's one of the most dubious and stupid achievements I've seen yet. You basically play 20 hours to earn the first one and then 40 hours to earn the second one.  -Though the storyline is like 8 hours (For me it was 6 hours including all the achievements except the Time achievements) and if you want to complete all the achievements, an extra 1-2 hours would be the assumption.    
571	1	a	This Indie-game is the perfect combination of 'The Omen' horror-film and gameplay from 'Hitman' franchise.
573	1	a	Good game with good graphics. You control a kid (the son of Lucifer) who is able to use telekinesis and others superpowers to kill people that you hate, but you have to hide your murder as an accident.   SO, use your brain and kill all these ♥♥♥♥ing people you hate and improve your mind.  I really recommend this game same if your action's circle is limited.  
575	1	a	As I bought this in the sale, I think it's worth my money. Absolutely in love with the appearance, mostly the garden.

579	1	a	Lucius is a awesome game but can be hard at times. You need to find out what to do and eventually you'll get caught doing it or moving too it. Really frustrating at times but that's all part of the game. :) I loved the game, the killing parts are the best. xD
581	1	a	Admittedly, most people won't enjoy this game. Games have changed and advanced, many scores are based on replayabilty, the scope of the enviroments, and freedom of variation in how to go about things. That's all superb standards to go by today, in open world/sandbox games. However, there is something to be said about restriction in games. With freedom of choice can also come a certain stress, and a sense of incompletion. There's the time and place for both, naturally, but some times there is something soothing and satisfying about playing a game the only way it's meant to be played.  'Lucius' is about exploring your surroundings and figuring out how the puzzles are solved. Sometimes the solution is far fetched, sometimes ridiculous. But all in all, there's some sort of logic there. I enjoyed this game far more than I probably should have. I liked it's simplicity, the house and garden, the idea of it all. Granted, there was much more potential behind the concept that was left unrealised, but for what it was, I enjoyed it.   Shiver Games tried to respond to peoples objections and critique to this first game somewhat in the sequel, which I can't speak of as I haven't played it, but, it did seem like that game have fallen apart in them trying to do so. It was probably more somewhat what they wanted the first 'Lucius' to be; being able to have access to a variety of tools to make death traps, lethal situations and weapons to off any number of roaming NPCs at any given point. From what I've read and seen though those ambitions resulted in a broken game with great potential. The more complex, the more wrong things can go.  'Lucius' has its fair share of bugs and limitations. But it also has a great idea behind it, and for me personally, finally getting the kill I was going for was surprisingly satisfying, as was achieveing 'good boy' status by doing mundane chores around the house. My guess is, if you get some self therapy by say, doing the dishes or painting the fence, you might enjoy this game. Get it on sale though. 
583	1	a	Lucius is quite a unique game which really caught my interest. It's not particularly a horror game, but it can be a little bit creepy at times and a lot of the deaths are pretty brutal. The game is mainly puzzle based and I think that the puzzles are quite easy, the only difficult part about it is probably locating the items. Everything graphically is good and it presents the game well in an appropriate style. I liked the achievements in this game, it really felt like I was progressing and it was quite motivating, I also liked the fun extra achievements too. However there were some problems with the game; there was a lot of laughable glitches concerning the character models, slow loading, a few crashes here and there, some freezing for a few seconds and bad lip syncing. I don't know if these (excluding glitches) were only exclusive to me though. Overall it's a nice, short game with a consistent theme, nice puzzles, nice graphics, a great soundtrack, well executed atmosphere. I recommend Lucius, especially if you like puzzles, looking for stuff, satanic stuff, murder and achievements. :)

587	1	a	Losing yourself in a giant mansion that looks more like a labyrinth SIMULATOR 2012 5/10
589	1	a	It's like the prophecy and you're playing with Damien. Seriously, it's pretty funny, specially how the things change because of this. If you don't get this type of stuff too serious, play the game and have fun.
591	1	a	Death to all.....
593	1	a	It's hilarious!
595	1	a	Loved this game. Hated everything about the ending, both the puzzle and action version were extremely frustrating! Completed the puzzle ending after lots of attempts only to find the steam achievements for the last 3 deaths were not recognised. Having now gone the action route I have been able to kill the priests and get the achievements but cannot get the dad in the right place to dispose of him and finding that it's game over after one hit from him is frustrating.
597	1	a	Very fun in a sadistic, creepy, serial killer type way. Controls are a little hard to get used to but once you adjust it is quite fun
599	1	a	damien returns in the sequel to the 1990s omen movie
601	1	a	This game is pure evil. You play as Lucius. The child of the Devil. It was very interesting and I felt pure evil playing this game.
603	1	a	Only just started this game however i can't recommend it highly enough. It's like hitman except youre the child of the devil and have to go around knocking off family and friends.... What could be more fun than that. It's only £1 on steam at the moment too..... Grab it quick!
605	1	a	Puurrfect. When you're not on edge, you're taking up too much space.
607	1	a	i really enjoyed it. the first stealth adventure i have completed legitimately
609	1	a	Enjoyable combination of Hitman and The Omen. The gameplay is linear and you're not offered multiple solutions to issues, but the atmosphere and story are enjoyable enough to keep you playing. I have thoroughly enjoyed my time with Lucius thus far.
611	1	a	Murder your whole family.....
613	1	a	amazing game pewdiepie plays it yay but all together i think it'sawesome :D
615	1	a	Only just started this game however i can't recommend it highly enough. It's like hitman except youre the child of the devil and have to go around knocking off family and friends.... What could be more fun than that. It's only £1 on steam at the moment too..... Grab it quick!
617	1	a	I really enjoyed this amazing game. 8/10.  + interesting storyline + not too easy + puzzle game + few side quests + the house is big and enjoyable + the powers are simple to learn + deaths were entertaining and creative + peli on suomalaisten tekemä ja sisältää hiukan suomalaista insideläppää joten se on mainitsemisen arvoinen plussa :)  - felt like the game wasn't long enough - the graphics are not most appealing but it makes the game look more scary - characters (doesn't include lucius or lucifer) were kinda impersonal - voice acting wasn't that good - if you fail a quest you need to start the whole chapter all over again  I maybe wouldn't buy this at full price but when it is on sale it is a must have.
619	1	a	I loved the original Omen movie. But as much as it tries, it gets nowhere close to the heartbeat of the original flick and the gameplay is frustrating rather than fun. This would have been better implemented as a Telltale story than this horrible point and click borefest.  Cons. -Terrible voice acting. -Too much wandering around trying to find stuff. -Too much wandering around trying to find stuff. -Too much wandering around trying to find stuff. -Demon powers are not actually any fun to use.  -No Controller support.  Pros. -Deaths are grizzly. If you like that sort of thing. -Graphics ok. -Worth a couple of bucks on sale.
621	1	a	Very fun game. sometimes challenging, sometimes gruesome, always entertaining, NEVER dull and maintains a good balance between logic and imagination.  The creators have done a great job of creating different scenarios for you to follow and figure out. Inside or out, the ambiance and graphics are very nice including the use of HDR. Dynamic weather keeps things looking pretty all year round and there are lots of nice finishing touches to keep your eyes busy. The textures are amazing.  The sound is nice and uniform throughout and along with the soundtrack adds good depth and atmosphere. Both graphics and sound come together to create a memorable environment where even just standing around is pleasant.  The plot is also good; although sometimes predictable there are always a few unexpected twists that are good for a laugh or two. One of the best things about the game-play is that you can explore at your own pace without being rushed (unless there is a specific reason).All this creates a fun, immersive and laid back approach to 3rd person adventure gaming.  There are walkthroughs online to help you out if you get really stuck, but if you use them you will get no since of satisfaction and inevitably feel like you've cheated yourself rather than won the game.  Game bugs are so few and minimal they are hardly worth mentioning. i.e. while carrying socks or underwear they might get stuck on a door (but they will release if you keep walking). The trike might (very rarely) rise a foot or two in the air if you run over an object (but will fall down again as you carry on). Once, the security guy walked right through me.  These are very minor, infrequent things that detract nothing from the game or gameplay! Especially if you have the imagination to immerse yourself into task at hand.  If you don't like something about the way this game is made (bugs or realism) i suggest you learn programming and try making your own game first Before going on a 'i'm a bug snob' crusade.  If you are religiously sensitive then this is not the right game for you. If you are religiously sensitive i can't imagine why you would even want to play.  Understanding that this is a game and not real life will go a long way to allow you to appreciate the experience that the creators are sharing. Just enjoy the ride and you'll have fun!  Review score 666 out of 10  Do your chores! 
219	0	a	First of all I can't really understand why this game has mostly positive reviews. Death ideas are clichéd. The plot is non-existent. Shooting someone with a pistol, or using a fireball results in a hit-and-run like effect on the victim. Hitman 2 required a full clip to be emptied on a victim to get this effect. Lucius' cannon would flabbergast even Dirty Harry. The fire extinguisher scene from the end of the game should occur in the game studio during the production phase. The 20h and 40h achievements are an offence in their own right. Especially that the playthrough takes 10 hours if you take a nap in the meantime. It's good that you can sleep through their completion.    - 'Unique 3D horror adventure gaming experience' - depends on one's definition of 'unique';  - '3D Open World' - to some extent;  - 'Cinematic Cut-scenes' - but surely not climatic;  - 'Breathtaking Atmosphere and Stunning Visuals' - breathtaking like a cockroach on a kitchen table;  - 'Harness Supernatural Powers, including Telekinesis and Mind Control' - if you can harness the game physics to move items;  - 'Experience the terror of a classic tale from the horror movie genre' - terror indeed.  Shiver Games breaks the fourth wall by making the player scared with how the game is made, not by the game itself. Cheers on that!
623	1	a	Got in in the Bundle Stars £1 bundle, probably the best pound I've ever spent xD  7.2/10
625	1	a	I mean, you controll a BUCKING DEVIL! I will spell it letter by letter; D E V I L, Demon Evil Villian Incarnation Lyar. Did you watched Omen? This is Omen the Video game (well this was kinda obvious). Anyway, this is hilarious game, kill those petty mortals, show them da pawa of HELL!
221	0	a	In 30 years of gaming i have never played a game where i have felt so dissapointed- you generally get something out of a game.... this was so childish in its relentless grind of how to kill over and over- no real storyline...definately no plot twists. this has been the only game wher i feel i will never get the time i wasted on playing this back! Never felt this way before...sorrry!
627	1	a	I got best walkthrough
629	1	a	As a horror genre freak and gamer, i truly love this game :D
222	0	a	I have seen better games. There is only one way to kill somebody (sometimes really stupid) what is just boring. When u finish the game u have no reason to play it again what makes game really short. I think this game had very high potential but game developers ruined it.
631	1	a	Positive surprice. I never thought that indie game inspired by 'The Omen' movies would make a good experience. Despite of the simple plot and gameplay this game succeeded to keep me playing it through without any larger pauses. The most unique thing in Lucius is damn well created cut-scenes. Especially those with murder were so stunning that they gave me cold chills. Good mixture of point&amp;click- and 'Hitman' -games, provides decent entertaiment for few hours. Play or Lucifer will have your soul!..kidding ^^ (Suomessa tehty)
633	1	a	Great game. 7/10 :)

637	1	a	Awesome and creative game with an eery soundtrack. There isn't much plot to the game (it's your generic Satanic horror movie story about a little kid being the anti-christ), but it's still sufficiently creepy to keep you intrigued to the very end.  Unfortunately, it is a rather short experience (I logged about five hours for my initial playthrough). Levels are fairly structured, though sometimes it can be easy to miss a certain detail and figure out what your next step is. You get several powers to use in the game, but realistically speaking, you will only use them each a few times.  I think there's room for a lot of potential here, some expansion that builds onto the story and lets you use your talents a little more creatively. But for what this game is right now, it's worth a playthrough.
639	1	a	Amazing game with an amazing gameplay. Even the music is creepy. Everyone who loves creepy stuff should play this game!!
641	1	a	You are Lucius Wagner, a 6 going on 7 year old demonic boy. Your goal is to kill your family and everyone inside your mansion. Your father is running for senate, but with all the death going on inside his home, he fears he will lose. Nobody suspects that a 6-7 year old boy has the capability of commiting over 15 murders.  The game took me about 8.5 hours to beat and get 56 of the 58 achievements, the two I didnt get being the 'Play 20 Hours' and the 'Play 40 Hours' achievements. It was fun while it lasted, but paying $20 for a game that took 8 hours to beat seems a little overpriced. It has a good story, and its extremely fun and intriguing, but I wish it lasted a bit longer. It would be worth every penny if it was only $10.  
643	1	a	Don't look at your map since it seems it will always tell you what you need to do next. There is no option to turn this off. Note that I have only played the game for about an hour so I don't know if this goes away. I just stopped looking at the map altogether.  With that said, if you're looking for a game where you play a character like Damien from the movie The Omen, this nails it.
645	1	a	Play as six year old Lucius the Antichrist and murder people horrific ways. Seriousely though this game is completely evil. Riding around your house on a tricycle on your way to kill somebody is freaky.   Lucius is a pretty decent game if you like creepy games. The controls feel incredibly smooth and the graphics look nice. My only complaint was that the ending felt unfinished, like they just ran out of money (being an indie game this is probable) and/or forgot to add the last five minutes.
647	1	a	Despite all critics, it's not a bad game at all. However a lower price than 18.99 € should be more appropriate.  (I got it for 1$ but it's worth it for 7-8€ or less)
649	1	a	This is nothing like finding nemo
651	1	a	The son of an unholy marriage; the game Hitman and the movie Omen. You get to play the 6 year old antichrist as he murders family and staff members in a variety of creative ways. If you're a fan of classic horror movies like the Omen and the Exorcist you will probably love the various references to them.
653	1	a	Great game. 7/10 :)
655	1	a	a must buy if you want to have fun 
657	1	a	Amazing game with an amazing gameplay. Even the music is creepy. Everyone who loves creepy stuff should play this game!!

661	1	a	A very interesting and enjoyable game, especially when you are the villain. Lucius basically plays like a 3rd person adventure game, where you take items and use them to complete tasks like killing people or doing chores, but mostly killing people.(This game is very graphic in some of the killings.) You're playground is the entire house, that unlocks completely after the third murder, but you can only kill a specific individual at a time. The tools can be collected at any time during the game even if you don't need them for that murder. As a reward for you're sacrifices you get paranormal powers that will help you kill more people. Powers like Telekinesis which isn't quite precise, mind control which is only used after everything else was prepared for the murder, mind wipe in case you get caught and a fireball for the boss battles which ware not enjoyable.  For the things this game gets right one thing one thing will annoy you a lot, that is the speed of the game. The tutorial is extremely fast, but after that it takes ages to figure out what to do, sometimes it's obvious, sometimes you get so stressed you look at a walkthrough just to get past that part (and whenever I need help outside what the game provides, it ruins the experience). Also the fact that the game does not have any checkpoints or save system outside the start of each chapter, if you make a mistake you go back to the start of that chapter. Another thing that I think the game could do without are the stealth levels and to some degree the boss battles.  A rather unique game, it mostly reminds me of the first Black Mirror game, a horror adventure game that was also slow, that had difficult puzzles and that also had a plot about the devil needing sacrifices for power. If you like adventure games and are looking for a horror story where you get to do the killing, this is the game for you, just be patient on the ride.
663	1	a	10/10 would sacrifice souls for satan again :^)
665	1	a	Murdering people with telekinesis, mind control, and pure evil distate for humanity? When did they start making video games about Hillary Clinton?
667	1	a	Omen like adventure game with a hint of action. Not too durable in time. Graphics are old generation and you will stuck in some bugs. Gameplay is linear. For adventurers is something different but it will be very easy to finish it. Nice for spending 3-4 hours.

673	1	a	What can I say. The game is pretty neat, the story runs well and you will not be bored. The graphics are average and the controls are not hard.  The only negative might be that sometimes it is not clear what to do.  I'd give it about 80%.
675	1	a	You play as a 6 year old who's the son of the devil, and your job is to murder your entire household. Who can't relate to that?? 10/10
677	1	a	this game.... wtf.  you play as a little boy that is the son of satan, el diablo, lucifer, wtfe you wanna call him. in this game you are in a huge mansion with many rooms to explore, you fine clever ways to kill the people living here, the maids, mechanic, buttlers, friends that visit, etc.  the way you kill each individual person is set, so if you kill them with a piano, that is the only way to kill them....so you cant switch it up.  you do need to sneak around and dont want to get caught while killing someone.  you need to collect items to finish you're murders.....like a screrw driver to unscrew/loosen things, or a lock to lock someone in a freezer, etc.  you also obtain special abilities/powers to help kill f****ers  you can also do good things, like chores around the house.  it is an interesting game, a different concept from abnything ive seen before and it is worth a try. though i doubt after beating it i'll play again, doesn't seem to be much replay value.   PROS: runs great no bugs or glitches ive seen kill people for no reason special abilities make you feel like anti-christ decent graphics nudity &gt;:) (cant have a satanic game without, just dont make sinse. jk) there are lots and lots of people in this mansion  CONS: the placement of all the residents and where they walk to and come back to seems to be set and doesnt change the replay value of this seems to be 0, once you beat it, there is nothing new gonna hapen next time through this game will upset jesus groupi... i mean good citizens that go to church &gt;:)   dont take offence to my review if you are a church goer, i'm only kidding.... or am i ;)   HELL yes i recommend! 7/10
230	0	a	I loved the concept - playing as a 'Damian' evil child while hiding your murders is a fun idea, but the game hides puzzle pieces too well while giving you the solutions to the puzzles too easily. I knew exactly what to do, but had no idea where to find the tools to let me do it. That's not fun. Also, this horror genre usually has beautiful children be evil - because the contrast of innocence and beauty with the vile and evil actions is chilling, but the artists for this game made Lucius a dough-faced plumpkin. That and other minor issues like cut-scenes that aren't cut as tightly as they should be hurt this game, but they could easily be overlooked if the puzzle pieces had been easy to find. I like figuring out how to do things, but I became bored immediately when I discovered that the game wants me to search all over for whatever items may be required to pull off a murder.
679	1	a	evil game full of killing ppl for our lord
232	0	a	This is an amusing game, but a very limited game. Obviously the graphics aren't the main draw, though they're serviceable. The main issue with this game is it's simplicity. I was hoping for a bit more openness, but it's a rigid storyline with rigid goals and only one way to do things. And it's not always clear what you should do.  Add to that an ending which is lackluster due to poor aiming controls and a cramped little arena, capped with an obscure final moment and it falls flat.  That's not to say the game isn't worth a little time and a little money. I picked it up for $2 during a sale and I don't feel I wasted my money. It is entertaining. Just not worth dropping too much green on it in my opinion.
233	0	a	I would like to like Lucius for it's rather unique theme (in the world of games anyhow) and an interesting idea, but the on-the-rails experience was pretty unrewarding in the end. Good for a few giggles here and there, but I wouldn't recommend it unless you really, REALLY want to play as a demonic little boy and the game is part of a sale.
234	0	a	I bought the game while it was on sale for $5.49, I played through the entire game to see how it turned out, but it is the most twisted, f***ed up game I have ever seen... I mean you can   mind control someone into killing themself by jamming a cross into their face over and over  ... It is a VERY Linear story, so you must do at least 90% of the things only one way(with no direction from the game as to how to do these things, IE: wiki will help a lot), but for the other 10% its more or less do you want them to kill themselves violently, or very violently...
235	0	a	This game is terrible. The idea is quite interesting, but the game is so poor in writing and programming that it is ruined from the start. The kills are probably ok for the most part (although there are some VERY silly ones), but sometimes you have to get items you wouldn't have even remotely considered getting for this kill, it gets ridiculous. The animations are just god awful, they are pretty basic and ruin most of the kills. Finally, the game is poorly optimized so even with a good rig you will get some fps drops, not to mention that on some parts I got stuck (usually in the garden ladders).   
236	0	a	Cool concept, quite poorly deployed. Incredibly linear, with very little actual choice. The map is horrendous, missed opportunity. -5/10
237	0	a	4.9/10 the devil is in the detail. Hmmm. This game really shows the good and bad of indie game production.  On the one hand it's a unique and interesting game concept, the sort of thing which the big guys would shy away from. On the other hand, it's not very well executed, and there are a number of bugs and glitches.  On the one hand, the story is pretty well put together, and not just dashing off another sequel, on the other hand, the game does become a little linear, with very few actual choices (you have to play for the kill in the cutscene, even when your twisted mind can see something better.)  It  is  fun and engaging, and easy to get the hang of, but when you open a drawer and it passes through a chair, people talk to you through walls, or you pass somebody on the stairs and end up riding on their head and looking through the ceiling, it breaks your immersion. Give it a go by all means, but don't expect too much.
681	1	a	its a good game that makes you the son of the devil and have to kill everyone in the house stratgicly. you stealth, tfs (third person shooter), and so much more. try the game cause it dosent get enough love. 
239	0	a	You command Lucius a child who seems to be under the influence of Lucifer. Lucifer tells you to kill people without getting caught to collect souls for him which in-turn makes you more powerful and you unlock more abilities which Lucifer teaches you.  Sound awesome right? No...  The biggest flaw is this is NOT a horror game like you may think. It's more of a 'mystery game' where you go around trying to find clues on how you are supposed to create each murder. The game is VERY vague with hints, and more often then not, you'll have no idea what you are supposed to be doing causing you to mindlessly search this house until something crosses your mind.   If mystery crime case games are not your thing, I'd suggest staying away from this game...  Although....with a guide it is 'somewhat' enjoyable causing drama, and watching people die as a child. Many games don't include children, and being a child-murderer has a slight charm to it.
683	1	a	I love this game :3
685	1	a	Its a good game i will Recommend it to Hitman fans and Those who like Anarchory and Devil's
687	1	a	Loved this game. This game is so dark but I couldn't go away from my computer when I started the game.  Graphics : Starts to be kind of outdated but really far from unplayable, they're decent.  Storyline : The overall storyline was good, some of the puzzle in the games are very hard but they're logic at the same time, liked it.  Other/Mechanics : The mechanics of the game are simple to learn but sometime they might be frustrating at times.
241	0	a	hmm...this game is suck, some objective not give you some hint, hint what must you do. it only give you some desc i spent my time to beat puzzle in here, but i give up i chose to see guide, this game make me frustrated, i bought this game because i think it's will be likes hitman but with lucifer theme. but...yeah i not recommend this game. Score: 2
689	1	a	I really wanted to play that game... but I can't. Too hard to play for me on mouse&amp;keyboard in this kind of game's I have tried playing, but well..  anyway game is not bad, just need controller ;F [Xbox] I'm gonna review it, bcs its cool game and I couldnt to dislike it just bcs no controller. I' m gonna wait for controller. Have fun, bye  Hey.. I'm back, so 1 day after writing this review I decided to play it on mouse.. and with time I learned it. `Funny thing is that - Tom is Like Bald from ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s - He was f* Susan more than 1h. `Interesting is that - there are nudes, I didint expect it, but ok `I could feel again like small boy [7y] and I have had to make chores, it was cool also soon I'm gonna get new bike. `But ' NPC`s ' are a little bit annoying, they just have 2 texts.. and always when I walk they talk a lot of s* to me `U can find HINTS [ what u have to do now ] when u end this mission or part of it.. that's pretty annoying [ not always ] `Also this house is f* huge, always getting lost I think that's all Still recommending ! Have fun, bye
691	1	a	You get to mess ♥♥♥♥ up!!
693	1	a	Lucius is a puzzle game where your goal is to assasinate people in order to please your father lucifer without being caught in the process, each time you make a sacrifice, you become more powerful on one of the different evil magic areas, telekinesis, mind control, mind erase and fireball, although fireball is only usable in very specific ocasions. The graphics are not bad at all, controls are ok to play with, sadly you can't use a gamepad. Some of the deaths in the game are very gruesome, sadly there's not enough graphics quality to back that up. For achievement hunters this is a easy game to get them all. I do recommend.
695	1	a	Good game. Teaches you how to kill in a lot of ways. Has some one or two NSFW and really horrendous achievement system.  Really? An Achievement for playing the game for 20 and 40 hours? One can finish this under 3 hours. I played about 5 hours maybe. Some hours I was AFK. I didn't skip cutscenes and took my time. I can't see how one could play this for 20 or 40 hours. It has a good story but after that you're definitely finished. Not so much repeatability.  But overall, good game.   This has been bundled SEVERAL times. Don't get this at full price. Find a trade or get this on a sale.
697	1	a	recommend this game. Its challenging but the guides help. If you choose to use a guide i recommend 'Lucius :3' if you comment wuth questions he'll reply with an answer
699	1	a	This game is heavy on the satanic stuff/brutal killings orchestrated by a creepy kid! Not my fav game by any means but for under 2 dollars it has merit. If you get to the end o game, theres two ending to pick from; an action ending where you can blast people with your best moves, or a puzzle ending that makes you have to do VERY specific things in order.. Was quite hard doing the puzzle ending, especially since I'm terrible at puzzles lol. But yea just a heads up that the action ending is likely more fun than the puzzle ending I did. Overall pretty fun game, pretty nasty at times though !!
701	1	a	You get to mess ♥♥♥♥ up!!
703	1	a	Fun game for failed-plans saturday :)  Basically, if you are a fan of the  Omen  movie series, you should consider this game. Imagine you are the Devils shild,, given few supernatural powers and a stask to arrange accidents for everyone in the house. Definiely  not worth lets say 10 Euro , but at the recent discount, it is a good investment. Why? Because the game takes about 8 hours to complete while watching movie only 2.
705	1	a	In short, Lucius is a dark little title that sees you playing as the son of Satan. You roam around your manor doing dark little deeds all in honor of your father. If you are the type of gamer who enjoys adventures games similar to the Sherlock Holmes series, and you also have a very twisted sense of humour, than this game is for you. It's not mindblowingly amazing, but it is a fun game to play when you do not fancy something very skill-based.
242	0	a	difficult tutorial with satan...
707	1	a	It's one of those games whereby the murders are all scripted and all you have to do as the player is to follow said script. It's disappointing in that aspect but other than that, it's an interesting concept and a decent game to play. I'd advise to get it when it's on sale.
709	1	a	More of a puzzle solving game, where the puzzles are murders. Some of the cutscenes are humourous, but the gameplay is linear and replay value is low. Still, achievements are easy to obtain.  6.5/10
243	0	a	tedious but thats just the best bits  
711	1	a	I got to play the Devil's advocate. 9/10.  Just quickly going to mass to ask for forgiveness.
713	1	a	I really enjoyed this game. A lot of people say the voice acting isn't good. The great music makes up for it IMO. I however think the cutscenes are very weak and annoying at times (specifically the last chapter STAHP). That is really my only complaint.   This game is Satanic af. 2 dollars for 8 hours of entertainment!
715	1	a	Filled with dark and creepy (dare I say ****ed up?) stuff. Enjoying this game is probably a really good reason to get your head examined which in this case is not necessarily a bad thing at all! Getting this one -75% is a steal so go for it!
717	1	a	Keep calm and kill everybody for the Glory of Satan!   666/10
719	1	a	10/10 - Took pictures of Uncle Tom screwing the maid. Looked at mommy in the tub through Uncle Tom's porn room. Killed a bunch of people. Very frustrating. Now I know Satan only has his 'horns' when you shine a flashlight on him. Stole a gun, and bullets, and killed everyone by going to the vault, and entering '6/6/19/66' (Lucius's birthday).
244	0	a	No quicksave or manual save function and no indication when the autosave is made. During the 2nd Satan tutorial mission the game spawns the box I'm supposed to telecinetically put a toy into right under me. Guess what, I can't jump, or move outside the box. Yes, the demonic spawn got owned by a cardboard box. Guess what, have to reload autosave. Guess what, game wants me to replay the whole last chapter again. No, thank you.
721	1	a	You can cycle upstairs and burn thousands of priests alive.
723	1	a	I got this game from a bundle and I didn't expect much from it.But the game is actually pretty good if you are into clever puzzles and storyline driven games.  The graphics are ok-ish even if sometimes they seem to glitch out or look weird,I didn't pay much attention to them because the main feature of the game is the clever ways you need to figure out on how to kill people around the house.The gameplay is linear but it's not boring because it's extremely satisfying to see the cut-scenes after you kill someone.There are even some side-quests but they feel like chores..wait..the side-quests actually tell you to do your chores.  I really enjoyed going through the game.It has a captivating story and I think it is worth picking this up from a sale or a bundle even if it is only around 6-8 hours long.
245	0	a	  'YOUR DAD IS VERY UPSET ABOUT YOU, LUCIUS'    I still remember in the early 2012 when I saw first pictures of the game and then trailer, I was like oh damn, we gonna make some rampage with this little evil son of devil right? But then again, let's be honest.   You was able to do more rampage in GOAT SIMULATOR than in this game.   Anyway, I was still pretty excited about it and I still was in first levels of the game but that has changed when you realized that there is one certain way how to perform the kill and you need to find it. Well, yes I do understand that most of them needs to be done like that, to prevent being suspicious but if Shiver Games put in the work, and make various ways like that, that'd be brilliant. But level-design was not bad, I'm just saying if there was more to do that would be very good. Also I saw somebody said that we should get 'beautiful Lucius but instead we got some fat plumpkin because evil goes within beauty' I do agree with that. Soundtrack is average, no tracks you will truly remember.   Whole story was pretty stupid, and it was not even progressing like I wish it would. Those 18 episodes were pretty down except few ones e.g. the one behind wine cellar. The powers that Lucius possess was really nice and various and that is good point. Steam Achievements was pretty easy but devs crossed line with some of those, when they tell you to be on 7 hours long game for over 40 hours. Currently it is changed so it tracks you time by Steam Library, but back in the days the tracker worked only when you was inside game, no menu, no alt+tab, no Steam Overlay and that was pretty pathetic.   Big and I mean trully mega big point goes to  Dante Manor  because that place is exceptional, truly beautiful and awesome. One of the best gaming spots I have ever been in. I did not even mind to walk around that big place from point A to B because it was joy.   I really want to put up THUMBS DOWN, but then again I start to think that it was not that bad journey and I will still give it UP. Lets see what second Lucius can do.    EDIT: 7 HOURS LATER - NA NA NA. Screw this game. I am changing thumbs to DOWN and rating from 6 to 4.    Bonus Point: Dante Manor   Rating: 4/10
246	0	a	Near as bad as Anna. Congrats! Could have been a good game. But a LOT of little details come and screw the game. Plain history, unsuprising ending .... Sadly, forget it.
725	1	a	Not bad. Goodstory. 7/10
727	1	a	What's more fun than being the Son of Satan?    Methodically killing everyone that lives in your household starting with the help and working to your family members without anyone suspecting a thing through a series of sometimes difficult puzzles? Absolutely!    Lucius was the first game that I ever purchased for Steam in 2012 and have continued to love the same since then and would highly recommend this classic to those who even just enjoy the gore-factor alone (let's get this straight- GORE from a 2012 game which shouldn't deter the squimish). I have honestly enjoyed playing through this game and watching as my actions create grief amongst the family, sending members into insanity, anxiety, and paranoia as you get away with murder upon murder through fifteen chapters.    My only issue with Lucius is the directional issue of the game itself, sometimes glitching and resulting in a level which is impassable which has happened a few times which I picked up items before the actual time that I needed them- or had no idea what I was doing in the level at all due to minimal direction. Other than that (and some slight issue with controller support) there are not many negatives to Lucius than sometimes rushed story/chapters and a semi-cheesy plot that parallels the Omen. Not to mention how uncanny Lucius' model is on top of the fact that he does not speak ( which is fine since the awesome voicework of the rest of the cast makes up for it compeltely with emotional delieveries of lies! ) and some slight animation lackage ( which I'll give leaniancy to since it is a 2012 game )   All and all, I would definately recommend this game to anyone who has had the hankering to be the murdering Son of Satan!   
729	1	a	Amazing Game. Enouth said
731	1	a	When Hitman was a kid...  
733	1	a	killing simulator  it was fun  thanks the awesome group AccidentlyReviewed for the game
247	0	a	Really wanated to enjoy this game, been eying it for a while. Boy, was I let down, probably just my expectations but this game is very linear, has basic point and click puzzles, nothing special/interesting to do and seems very short. Great concept, needs more to it. Was worth it at 99c but I purchased the bundle at $10. Second game looks like it fixed some of these issues but appears to have far too many issues to stop me from getting a refund on the whole thing. Probably would've considered a $5 on just this one, but I can't.
735	1	a	killing simulator  it was fun  thanks the awesome group AccidentlyReviewed for the game
737	1	a	  One of the best games I have ever played... Wow. Everything was on point. Except for some subtitle mishaps but that didn't affect the experience much.  10/10  Had to use a guide, though, I didn't want to click through all the interactable objects in the game :D  The guesswork got boring at one point.
739	1	a	Third-person 3D real time adventure game where you're a satanic psycho killer little kid with satanic powers who goes around killing people. The missions are all 'kill the next person' sort of tasks, so far. There's a stealth aspect to the game. The game seems to be rather demanding 3D hardware-wise as my nvidia 770M (equivalent to a 660 desktop card, basically) runs rather slow on default settings (1920x1080 high detail). Lowering the detail level to medium helps a good bit.  Looks nice, but this sort of game isn't really my thing. I'm marking it 'recommended' anyway just because I like the general idea of a game where you get to be a satanic little psycho killer kid who goes around breaking things and rigging stuff to kill people. (Oops, accidentally dropped the hairdryer in the tub.) But the game mechanics are still rather limited.  I got this game cheap in a bundle.
741	1	a	Play as young demon Bruce Wayne but this time you get to kill the parents!
743	1	a	Achievements ' Paparazzi ' ( Take 20 pictures. )  What did i do ?  F12 , 20 times.  What did i not get ?  Paparazzi Achievement .
745	1	a	The game is very good! I had played it many times and enjoyed it.
747	1	a	Very good game, especcialy for those, who want to play games with light part of fantasy. Game is something like Risen 2 and Harry Potter, but it's something better.  
749	1	a	Awsome game, i love playing it c:
248	0	a	has potential, almost like an interactive version of the omen. but i got bored with it really fast, id suggest grabbing something else unless its really cheap.
249	0	a	Well first off one of the only reason's i bought this game was the price tag at the time was about 6$ which i would pay for this peice of ♥♥♥♥, First the story sucks all you have to do is kill people with you powers you got from hell (which all suck and are hard to use) Second the controlls are terribale to move sideways is hell, also where you get the powers from Weird hgg? so many things wrong with this game just dont buy it it's a piece of ♥♥♥♥
751	1	a	Locked myself in the walk-in fridge.  Karma's a ♥♥♥♥♥ 10/10.
753	1	a	Bought this game to make my bed and clean my room.  10/10 would play again.
755	1	a	Lucius Is A Very Good Game, However, If You Play With A Laptop On This Game It Could Get Very Laggy And After Killing The 2nd Person You Need A Mouse. If You Do Not Have A Mouse Then Your A Bit Stuck
757	1	a	I'd like more if I can freely kill ! 66/6
759	1	a	Lucius is a very interesting game, you play as a child with powers. I enjoyed the story and at 1 part you can see boobies  69/420
761	1	a	wish i could leave a review,downloaded it a wk ago n cant play it as its quite laggy on my pc n it wont let me play it on another pc,tried downloading it again but no joy ,any help ??
763	1	a	Lucius brings back the fun I remember from playing early sandbox games. The 'Story' portion of the game which takes you from start to finish is very linear. But I found a lot of times I was content to use the house as a playground for Lucius's powers instead of always immediately targeting my next victim. The game also somewhat obviously boasts quite a violent streak, almost to the point of it suffering from how extreme they are compared to the subtly in the story from the detectives perspective, and how the characters seem to nonchalantly react after 4 or 5 gruesome deaths. The game also feels a little short, even with mucking about this game is not in it for the long haul at all and with the linear story having almost no replayability that is a bit of a down-note for Lucius. Bottom Line: definitely worth getting, if it's on sale.
765	1	a	This game is hilariously bad.
767	1	a	I'd give it a 7/10. It's about 7 hours of gameplay and plays like a horror Hitman. It's good fun, but def not worth $20. I'd say $10 is the right price.
769	1	a	Good game. Think Hitman, but it takes place in a Mansion and you play as Lucifer's son. I Love the detail on Lucius, he looks like a ....devil.  Performance could be better, I was playing on a lower end laptop and it ran, but stutterd every now and again. Would still rec for good story, setting, and very immersive.  7/10
771	1	a	I'm Christian.
773	1	a	If 'Hitman 2' had taken place in the early 1970s with a charming 6 year old boy you would have LUCIUS. Gameplay is very reminiscent of the early 'Hitman' series in which you pull off murders (making them appear as accidents) in order to reap souls for Satan. There is so much more to this game and a lot more forward-thinking than anything in the 'Hitman' series. Planning is key along with some 'just the right time' scenerios to allow you to fly under the radar for some time. Pull daily chores like cleaning your room, which you can do via telekinesis as you gain unholy powers as you progress; help out the mechanic or gardener or kill some charming employees, friends, and family members. This game is definately worth the $3 I got it for and it will be remembered and replayed for ages to come.
775	1	a	Game is fun to play, it has interesting mechanics and gameplay. But sometimes you will get stuck because you wont know what to do and game gives you only hints. But if you ever get stuck there age good Community Guides that will help you.
777	1	a	great game 
779	1	a	Lucius is a very fun game that can last for hours. I highly recommend it for people who love games with action, puzzles, and a bit hard challenges.

785	1	a	Oh boy, oh boy! What is better than being a Son of Satan and killing bunch of innocent people in your house while nobody know it's you...
787	1	a	A twisted game that is definitely for horror fans, if you love movies like The Omen then this is for you. IMy only complaint is that the killings are scripted so there is no freedom on how you kill your victims.
789	1	a	wish i could leave a review,downloaded it a wk ago n cant play it as its quite laggy on my pc n it wont let me play it on another pc,tried downloading it again but no joy ,any help ??

799	1	a	Much better game than I anticipated, I would've never spent 20 euros on this, but I've been keeping my eye on it as the concept intrigued me. Finally got it with an indie bundle, it's been quite fun (but I still wouldn't recommend it for that price, that's just too high). I've finished Lucius in 6,6 hours according to steam (lol the coincidence), the game allows you to free roam this mansion while you think of a way to kill your quarry, Hitman style, however, it is pretty linear in it's killings, while the world is pretty much open (you can do chores and help people to be a 'good boy' or just find stuff for chapter 7 while you're still on chapter 4 (for example, I found the revolver needed for ch 7 by randomly guessing the combination to a safe)) the solution to every kill is only one. Some solutions are harder, some are smarter, there's a fine line between freedom and story in what could be called an Adventure game, because it all boils down to you living a story and having no impact to the main events. That of course eliminates any incentive for a replay, except for the final part that has 2 endings, both which I found enjoyable, but one is better story-wise. Overall it was a fun experience for the 4,50 Euros, like following a film + adventure game, of course I wouldn't spend more than that on it, mainly because, if you have your witts with you, then the game will be over soon.
801	1	a	Play as the son of Lucifer, just make sure the grown ups do not catch you or it is back to your room and no dinner.
803	1	a	Good game, but you only realise its potential 75% through the game. Not enough playtime. 6/10
805	1	a	i love this game because it combines my two loves the first being puzzles and the second being satan. the game has a unique atmosphere and perspective, i love any game that lets you be the bad guy. i enjoy this game for the same reason i enyoy TTT in garys mod except i like this more because it forces you to be more intelligent and it means i don't have to deal with other people. i can't right a review on this game without mentioning that i broke it, there are stones that appear on the grass in the garden which you use in a puzzle late in the game, under no circumstances should you pick them up until you need them. a particularly like the things little things in this game like the crow that sits on the tree staring at you. i also need to point out that upside down crosses are not satanic. this game has one of my favourite depictions of satan in it because it is the spiting image of someone i know.
807	1	a	Really good game, puts you in the view of the killer as you have to try and kill people using creative situations. You have powers such as mind control, and telekenis, only thing bad was it was a very short game, beat it in about 8 hours. Would i recommend this game? I would DEFIENTLY recommend this game.
809	1	a	'Lucius' Developed by Shiver Games and published by Lace Mamba Global. It was released October 26th 2012. The game is set in the 1970’s and is a horror adventure game.   Gameplay 6/10  I enjoyed the game play. I walked into the game blind so I didn’t have any expectations. It’s in third person. You move with the usual WASD keys. The game is linear so you don’t have much choice in what happens. But, it’s got a nice story to it. Only thing I really disliked was the way they implemented the third person cam without the option of a first person view. It got awkward in some instances trying to kill someone. You also don’t talk the entire game. So, if you like silent protagonists, Lucius(character) is for you.   Music/sound 5/10  The soundtrack for this game really helped set the mood for the things you were doing. It really helped in the immersion of the game. I’m not sure what other people thought about the voice acting. But at certain times it was nice and other times not so much. Creativity 6/10 This story was rather nice, I liked it. All through the game the story is nice; the narration between chapters is done well. But, the one thing that broke me was the ending. Left so many questions unanswered. Other than that it’s a normal adventure game.   Graphics 8/10  The graphics are nice considering this is an indie game. The fires are decent, though with my testing on lower graphics they’re a bit blocky for the poor low end computers out there. Not pretty. But, on the highest setting they’re fine.   Replay Value 5/10  The replay value of this game isn’t much. But, if you want to kill a few people while following a decent story, I can see you coming back to this.   Enjoyment 8/10  Maybe I’m a sadistic person. I really enjoyed finding out how to murder the people without getting caught quite fun. I had a blast with the death cutsceens as well.   Overall 6.5/10  This is a decent game. I recommend it to anyone who likes linear adventure/puzzle games. It has a satisfactory story and you get satisfaction for killing the people. Just don’t expect an over the top ending, it leaves you with questions.    References. R1 =  http://shivergames.com/  R2 =  http://www.lace-mamba.com/   Please comment, I'm always looking to improve!
811	1	a	Lucius brings back the fun I remember from playing early sandbox games. The 'Story' portion of the game which takes you from start to finish is very linear. But I found a lot of times I was content to use the house as a playground for Lucius's powers instead of always immediately targeting my next victim. The game also somewhat obviously boasts quite a violent streak, almost to the point of it suffering from how extreme they are compared to the subtly in the story from the detectives perspective, and how the characters seem to nonchalantly react after 4 or 5 gruesome deaths. The game also feels a little short, even with mucking about this game is not in it for the long haul at all and with the linear story having almost no replayability that is a bit of a down-note for Lucius. Bottom Line: definitely worth getting, if it's on sale.
813	1	a	This game is hilariously bad.
815	1	a	I'd give it a 7/10. It's about 7 hours of gameplay and plays like a horror Hitman. It's good fun, but def not worth $20. I'd say $10 is the right price.
817	1	a	Whether you might find Lucius worth picking up can quickly be deduced by whether the basic concept sounds like it could carry a game for you. Playing as the son of the devil you utilize a number of psychic powers and everyday household objects in specific situations to orchestrate a series of unlikely and over-the-top “accidents (murders). Does that sound fun and like something you could do for 6-8 hours? Then come on board. But if you’re expecting it to be more than that, or if you were hoping for a sandbox experience that lets you decide how to use those powers then you probably won’t get what you want out of it.   It’s of great importance to note that Lucius is less Bully/Saints Row and more Monkey Island/Myst…just…with more murder. Yes that’s right despite appearances this is for all intents and purposes a real-time, fully 3D, point-and-click adventure. Things are rarely action oriented, instead forcing you to locate a number of items and utilize them in the correct location alongside a host of generic powers such as telekinesis and mind-control to arrange your targets untimely demise. Essentially being your average adventure game puzzles wrapped up in a macabre aesthetic.  This wasn’t a negative to me, but if you were hoping to be let loose in a world where you could unleash your powers on a whim in any way you could dream of you’ll be disappointed. In fact, it’s quite the opposite with a few exceptions and if you use your powers outside of the areas they’re allowed you’ll likely receive a game over. Since part of the story is remaining undetected and making the murders look like accidents or shifting the blame on to someone else you’ll lose the game if someone catches you lighting things on fire with your mind or the like. There’s some leniency there and it’s not so strict as to be aggravating, but it does limit what you can do. Even in the areas you’re meant to use your abilities you have to figure out the exact way the developers intended for you to use them to solve the puzzle and cause the murder. Again this will be a negative for some, but on the opposite end it does allow some of the murders to be really excessive and over the top since you can cause things you could never have orchestrated on your own.  It does however highlight one of the big problems I have with the game. Some of the powers feel pointless and you can really see this when some of them are only used once or twice in the entire game. For instance a power you get later in the game is pyrokinesis, the ability to create and control fire with your mind. At first this seems really neat but the game quickly comes up against its own wall. Since you’re supposed to be stealthy and subtle there really isn’t much use for this ability outside of two places where it’s shoehorned in. And of course using it anywhere else immediately gets you noticed and get a game over. Telekinesis and mind-control are used rather frequently, but otherwise the other powers feel throw-away and serve little purpose.   The secondary game mechanic is the occasional stealth bit. Usually you get to “hide in plain sight by virtue of being a child. But a couple missions call for sneaking around the house after dark. These are pretty simple as long as you keep your wits about you and watch the patrolling guards’ flashlights. This also shows off another useless ability in the form of “memory erase which is supposed to be there to quickly make people forget they saw minor things such as you wandering around after dark or levitating objects. You can use it only a few times a mission but it’s more than enough to make the stealth situations criminally easy, and even then I had to use it a grand total of one time. Still these sections have some very nice lighting and are quite ambient.  There are some sidequests in the form of “chores such as taking out the trash, doing laundry, and helping people find valuables they misplaced. Yes, that really is as boring as it sounds but it serves an interesting point in that it makes you look like a normal child. As the game continues on and more-and-more people die everyone begins doubting each other, especially you. But if you keep up the act of appearing normal their reactions are less extreme. I don’t know if they figure you out if you don’t do the chores since I always did them, or if their dialogue just changes, but either way it was a nice touch. Bonus points for you getting “gifts for doing enough of the chores, though only one in the form of a tricycle that lets you move around faster is of any real use.   Aesthetically the game is very nice. From an actual graphical stand-point it’s an average looking game, being neither great nor terrible. But a Gothic Victorian setting with a very carefully crafted and detailed house to explore makes the graphics themselves a non-factor, as the architecture and degree of detail present is fun to look at regardless. A muted color scheme, hazy filter, and a perpetually dreary skyline punctuate and bring the macabre, grim setting to life. This is laid against the backdrop of some rather creepy old-timey Vaudeville inspired music that fits the setting perfectly.   Most of the games bugs are graphics based so I’ll stick them here. The game doesn’t have any truly game-breaking bugs but it does have a host of minor hiccups like characters teleporting a few feet, physics enabled objects getting stuck and “stretching across the screen, characters getting hung-up on doorways, and some funky hit-detection. Again nothing game breaking, but some atmosphere breaking stuff to be sure if that’s enough to turn you away from buying it.   Story-wise things work but are nothing special. Did you ever want to play the Omen as a game taken wholesale? Well that’s what you’re going to get. Though at times it seems like the game can’t decide if it wants to be The Omen word-for-word, or The Omen with some parody tossed in. For the most part it’s played completely straight but a few scenes and characters seem like they are there almost as a joke. Not a “Ha ha laugh out loud funny joke, but a sort of pervasive dark humor. Some might enjoy this but for me it felt out of place because most of the game takes itself so seriously. Additionally the ending feels rushed, it comes out of nowhere and is more than a little underwhelming. I got enough fun out of the rest of the game to forgive it, but the last few chapters feel like they had half of the time and work put into them being shorter, easier, and not requiring nearly the same level of mental thought to solve the puzzles.  Overall I enjoyed Lucius and I think there’s a lot to come here for. But the game isn’t without issue both from a design and technical standpoint. If you come in expecting a game where you get to cause some over-the-top murders from the role of son of the devil you’ll probably be entertained by what you get, but if you’re expecting a revolutionary experience or some unknown gem of a game you’ll likely not find what you wanted.
819	1	a	What a sadistic child. XD
821	1	a	For who like to play adventure games with a mix of psycho killing horror then this a game for you! Regardless of the non high graphics you have a good story line. You need to preform a variety of kills, collect items and combine some, set death traps and much more.
823	1	a	Cool game about little Devil. 8/10
825	1	a	Ever wondered what it would be like to be the spawn of Satan? Well here is your chance! Really cool little game with some clever puzzling elements and lots of gory deaths. Think of it as 'Omen The Game'. Recomended.
827	1	a	I'd say the movie 'The Omen' was an inspiration for this game. You are the son of the devil and yur goal is to be a little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Killing staff members in your giant mansion while 'Daddy Lucifer' occasionally visits to give you new gifts. Like a ouija board that hints at what you are supposed to do to kill your target for the chapter you are in. So far there have been some grizzly deaths and it has been entertaining to play and well designed. The only complaints I have is the acting is terrible, there are times where you just don't know what to do, and the AI could be much better. People walking into closed doors, and repeating themselves multiple times because they are only programed to say one line per level. But all in all, I would say it is worth the buy.
829	1	a	I got it in a steam sale and it was really cheap, like less than a cinema ticket, and its pretty cinematic and heavy enough on plot to keep me satisfied. All in all a pretty good game. An achievement hunters dream.
831	1	a	It is kind of free world, as far as the house goes, so I had to resort to a walkthrough to figure out what I was supposed to be doing next. Other than that great game.
833	1	a	Creative game, like seriously. Through out the game u feel like ur getting away with everything that u've done, and at the end BOOM u r son of satan and u burn everything down MUAHAHAHAHA, ahem.  That being said, the bicycle control is weird and the achievements r just unreasonable. I mean really, 40 hours? Who would play this game for 40 hours?  Other than that, I had fun in this game and its definiely a game u should try.
835	1	a	Surprisingly a good game with decent graphics, just let down by all the bugs and ****ed up things.   7/10
257	0	a	Utterly Linear, laggy(bad performance), generally boring, AWKWARD controls, terrible graphics(them character models) and the worst of all, it is all built around the philosophy of the one-way path gameplay to goal. Nothing like the multitudes of choice you get in a good Hitman game, lets say which is exactly what this game should have been like(Hitman as a Devil child with Super-natural powers). Instead you get to click on objects and wade through the terrible designied interface system un till you connect the dots metaphorically with some object(s) which are pre-determined to then finally allow you to kill some sterotypical house dweller in some very sterotypical pre-determined ways. Note PRE-DETERMINED, this felt more like a puzzle game to me than some crazy/inventive sandbox killing fun as an Omen child clone.   It's not worth even an hour of your time. I personally stopped playing after 4 missions it was SO terrible and laborious to wade through, has the typical cheesy investigator is getting suspicous of supernatural happenings storyline to from [insert random devil child movie here]. Oh and the investigators name is MCGUFFIN... even the Developers think this game is a joke, clearly.  Lets hope Lucius 2 really delivers the Hitman-esque Omen game that many of us, including me want.
258	0	a	This game feels like a bad joke. It also suffer from most common problems in puzzle games. Only redeeming factor for me is the gruelsome murder scenes, but even this is only mildly entertaining.

839	1	a	Really good game, puts you in the view of the killer as you have to try and kill people using creative situations. You have powers such as mind control, and telekenis, only thing bad was it was a very short game, beat it in about 8 hours. Would i recommend this game? I would DEFIENTLY recommend this game.
841	1	a	That game can make the time you spend playing it fun and pretty interesting. The game has a fine graphic and cool gameplay, the soundtrack is good. This was a unique experience playing that game and I liked it a lot.
843	1	a	Spent 10 minutes running around the house trying to find the maid, only for her to be in the room next door from where I last started.  Genius/10, would get lost again.
845	1	a	Lucius. I can keep going on and on about this game. It's so freakin' awesome! Simply be a kid of 6 years old and murder your family and friends around it! Funny and cool. The graphics are not that good, but it will have to do. The game is about Lucius, the 6 years old kid. The story is about him, he is the devil's son. At the 6th day of the 6th month on his 6th birthday (or let's say: 666) he becomes evil. His first kill is the old maid, which we don't care about, since she had too much icecream (you'll get the joke when you play it).  One thing creeped me out the most, since that the graphics aren't that good, the face of the people don't show any emotions, not that much at least. For Lucius this is even worse, his black eyes, looking through your skin, no emotions, only pure evil. The game is not scary at all, but his face scared me.  The only spoiler I will make is that there are 2 different game-ends, you'll have to pick the one you are attracted too.  It's no open world, that's the saddest thing about the game, you can not leave the house/garden. It's actually a really small map which you can walk in. Luckily you'll get something better later, to move around.  I recommend this game to all of you. If you like to play the bad guy some time, then this is it. Murder your family and their friends for fun, nobody expects the kid to be the killer! Watch out for some signs though, they make you weak. For a decent price, for me at least, it's great. Though, it's only singleplayer, so it still might be too expensive. If you buy it: You're awesome, Have fun!
847	1	a	  very funny and yummy
263	0	a	I first played Lucius with high expectations but it only took me less than a hour that despite the great concept and promisse of this game, it failed deeply to deliver. For those of you who don't know, basicly the premisse of Lucius is that you're the son of Satan and he speaks to you at certain times teaching you new powers/spells and when you find a certain person on your house he'll tell you that you need to kill her. I understand that some games are better done if they restrict the player options ,in order to experience a story for example, but in this case I feel like the death of each one of those individuals being scripted didn't actually helped that much. Sure the developers created on their own way for each person to get killed in order to unfold the story which takes place around you and the detective which is investigating the deaths on your house along with your family but I feel like if they allowed to each player kill those people using their 'imagination', per say, and their powers it would be actually alot more fun, don't get me wrong I actually thought some of them were well made. I also felt like the game was poorly optimized because I believe the cutscenes are rendered ingame and they ran pretty poorly for me for some reason but that's maybe just something on my end. One thing I really hated was that sometimes if you wake up and you need to get a certain item in order to kill someone, if you miss your 'window of oportunity', like someone goes over to that room and they can't see and you need to wait for him to go to sleep it's actually pretty boring, atleast for me anyways. Overall I can't put myself to playing Lucius until the end because I just can't take it, the concept is great but it's poorly executed as far as I see it or maybe I just don't like the game at all. Eitherways, I don't recommend this one, beware.
849	1	a	Finally i've been waiting for so long to play this game lel.   it's alright although there have been some glitches and bugs i've come across to but that didn't stop the experience  storyline 6/10  gameplay 7/10 graphics 9/10 voiceacting 6/10  = 7/10 it's average give it a try m9
851	1	a	In this game you are kid and you are kill people its logic and fun buy this game.
266	0	a	Worst game I've seen this far. I was stuck in-game after some chapters and was never able to finish the game even with help of forums. There is also no ability to save. It looked promising but you will get detected often and 'game over'
267	0	a	Decent game. 6/10 The graphics are pretty well designed. The gameplay is a bit akward. It submerges you into the game with hardly any instruction. I was stuck on the second murder.  It's not worth the money unless you just enjoy figuring out stuff on your own.
268	0	a	This game plays and looks like it was built with a Unity ♥♥♥♥ing engine alright, i'v seen ♥♥♥♥ing Yandere Simulator capture the same gameplay, but compairing the 2 just makes this game look like a joke. The Story for Lucius was amazing, hands down, 10/10, but the execution was down right ♥♥♥♥ing stupid. If i am the son of satan and i can launch ♥♥♥♥ing fireballs to kill people, i should have the option to do this. This is what makes Yandere Simulator so much better, it's not even finished yet, and i can already tell that it is better than this game. 3/10, Amazing story, voice acting and graphics, but the gameplay ♥♥♥♥ing sucks.  Edit: I forgot to mention, i beat this game in a single afternoon while eating a pizza. Puzzles are not creative and boring. Dont buy Lucius 2 either, Lucius 2 goes for the kind of, do it yourself type of game. But that game down right glitched and did nothing to make me entertained. This series of games is stupid, make a ♥♥♥♥ing book with the same concept to enjoy this to the fullest.
269	0	a	This game is extremely buggy and hard. I couldn't even finish it because of all the glitches. Plus, there are no checkpoints, so if you fail a mission, you have to restart everything, even if said mission takes a tremendous amount of time. I also had to go online to finish the puzzles... On the plus site, there is: One scene with boobs One sex scene Gory cut scenes if you're into that... 
853	1	a	demon babies make this game amazing buy this game and you get the chance to be satans little boy and murder your own family for satan with satanic powers!
855	1	a	If you liked the Omen you will love this game.
857	1	a	I showed my cult this game and they seemed to enjoy it, the Featheriver ward of the Mormon church approves!
273	0	a	Picking objects. Picking objects. Combining objects. Cleaning up bedroom. Killing. Picking objects. Picking laundry. Killing. Meeting father sometimes. Killing. Getting caught by night and game over because I must go to bed. I AM THE SON OF SATAN YOU GO TO BED MORTAL !!! Losing all objects. Picking objects. Killing. Picking objects. Being technically stuck in the court with no way of walking out of there. Loosing consciousness because a dumb player decided to stop the game and never play it again.
859	1	a	it's a cruel story to kill everyone in the house including his own dad and mom, i just love lucius mom and NOT his dad ! if i could choose i'll choose his mom to stay with lucius, btw this game is so epic, try and enjoy guys !!! ^^

867	1	a	I Luv This Kid
869	1	a	Game about kid, who's killing everybody satan tells him to kill.
278	0	a	don't bother. Buggy unfinished and Linear. Frustrating endgame, poor design. Decent concept but no imagination and very scripted use of powers. Dissapointing
279	0	a	The son of the devil possesses all the grace and maneuverability of a pontoon boat with rocket thrusters. Who told you people this game was finished? It is a struggled just to walk through a door. Seriously. I'd like my $5 back.
280	0	a	This game had me frustrated. The puzzles are sometimes stupidly hard to solve, even with clues, which will have you running up and down the hallways over and over again until you start screaming yourself red in the face. I found myself looking to the user made guides more often then I'd like to admit which left me feeling like a $3.00 hooker with a skin disorder. On the up shot, the guides were very well put together and very helpful if not a little presumptuous at times.  I don't recomend this game for anyone with attention problems which, lets face it, is most gamers. The graphics are nice and although it lacked the horror aspect, which is what I half expected when buying it, the story is fairly well written.  I didn't hate this game. I just can't bring myself to recommend it to anyone based on my experience with it. If it wasn't for the guides I would have given up on this game soon after pressing play.
281	0	a	It has a nice concept, but ultimately the game is just very poorly executed. On the technical side I've experienced numerous glitches and a few crashes. In-game the inventory and 'mission log' are very awkward to use, and the map is broken. The game offers little support for your objectives. As it has some puzzle elements this isn't necessarily a bad thing, but the game has such tight grip on how a specific objective or 'kill' has to be executed that some kind of support would be nice. The fact that the game's kills are largely scripted doesn't even bother me that much. The main frustration lies in the fact that you have to carry it out exactly as the game wants you to. For instance, halfway through the game you are tasked with carrying water outside without gaining any suspicion. As all but one character are in the same room this could have been as easy as taking a bucket from the laundry room, filling it with water and carrying it outside without bumping into any NPC. Instead, the game wants you to go to a very specific room and take a very specific object to carry the water around. Unfortunately it doesn't end there. Some of the more interesting sections have you sneaking through the mansion at night. As some of the NPCs are still awake you have to take care not to bump into them. However, as the game is rather unforgiving in this, such sequences quickly turn into trial and error. In the game, you use specific powers such as telekinesis and mind control to achieve objectives. A downside is that simple things like picking up stuff or opening doors are treated in the same manner, meaning that this form of interaction also has to be selected from a hotkey. This became frustrating when I spent five minutes trying to open a door but wasn't able to do so as I still had telekinesis selected as active ability. When using a power such as telekinesis or mind control you have to aim extremely careful for it to take effect. Towards the end, this became so tricky that I had to go to the options menu to considerably lower my mouse sensitivity. The game has some annoying invisible walls (or rather 'fences') placed around some objects which obscure your ability to toss fireballs past them. A plus side is that this is one of the very few games where you play a true villain (not just an antihero) and that the atmosphere is very nice. It is just pitiful that the game is so poorly executed.  Tl;dr: nice concept; bad execution.
282	0	a	It starts out pretty well but quickly turns into the kind of adventure game where you need to keep the walktrhough open in the Steam browser as murder plans become more and more convoluted. Moderately entertaining if you find the premise entertaining but ultimately very flawed - particularly in terms on pacing and escalation.
283	0	a	If you're seeing this review, then you're probably very interested in 'Lucius', a third person action-horror game where you play the son of the devil and go around reaping souls in pretty gruesome ways. While the concept looks good on paper, execution wise the game goes only halfway.  Whether intentionally or not, it's pretty humorous going around as a little kid and messing things up around the manor. The character himself never talks throughout the game, which is pretty creepy and is even made reference to at one point in the storyline. The abilities you are able to use are cool as well, like mind control, telekenisis, and even fireballs! (although you can only use that ability at specific points, mainly scripted events). Unfortunately that's where the positives really end, the storyline of the game is pretty bland and not very in-depth. Not that long into the game you'll start to get somewhat bored of it and would rather just go back to your own evil devices. The cutscenes (which I'm pretty sure use the in-game engine) are god-awful, ranging from out of touch lip syncing, wooden voice acting and PS2 textures. Another thing is that actually figuring what to do next is a challenge in of itself, most of the time you'll be wandering around the manor, bumping into different rooms and accidentally finding important items. The worst part is if you fail on a mission, you have to start the ENTIRE mission all over again, which mainly happened for me during the stealth sequences in the game. The worst kind of Trial and error. Overall, this game is only really worth getting if it's at a low enough discount (75% or above) and even then save it for when you don't have anything else to play. It's not worth the wait or hype. Again this is my opinion, if you have a different view and enjoy this game wholeheartedly then that's great! :) But for me, it was a mediocre experience.
284	0	a	Game is crafted well and has a good storyline to it. But for me personally it lacked anything else, you do a same routine each moment and you don't feel that you have accomplished anything.
285	0	a	You can't save the game, for starters. So everything you do, you have to start all over again next time you want to play. If you can manage to play it all in one sitting, then props to you. The story is only mediocre at best. The game play is only 'alright'. All in all, it isn't enough to capture my attention for more than an hour.
286	0	a	This game seems half ♥♥♥♥♥. Like they released an alpha and then just ran with it.

875	1	a	A really cool game that I believe was inspired from The Omen movie. You play as Lucius, the son of Lucifer. Lucius was born June 6th, 1966 (666 incase you haven't figured it out lol) into a family where his grandfather was worshiping and offering sacrifices in a hidden chamber all the way since his kids were young (Lucius bio father and his brother), which is the reason the family is so rich.  The game starts when Lucius and his family are celebrating his 6th birthday when Lucifer visits him in a vision and points him to kill the maid. After he's done it, while Lucius is sleeping Lucifer visits him in his dream and teaches him a new skill. And that's basically what the game's all about, killing people and learning new abilities to use to kill people marked by Lucifer, until the end where you all the choas happens (won't spoil it) and you leave the manor as an innocent young kid and taken away by the detective after the fire that was burning down the manor.   You can do many things other than solving puzzles and killing people around the house like tricycling around the manor, annoying people, messing around with your abilities, getting detected and then erasing the memory from those who saw you use it, doing chores for your parents and people who work at the manor which gets you some gifts like the tricycle, music box and a boad game.  - Graphics: 6.5/10 but it really isn't that important to me. - Story: 8/10 It was entertaining and fun. - Gameplay: 7.5/10 Could've been better. - Price: I got it off BundleStars along with a few games in a bundle for $2.49 and it was totally worth it. If you don't like the full price, just wait for it to go on sale and get it along with Lucius II.   Final score: 7/10. Good and fun game.

297	0	a	Holy Crap, was this not any where even remotely close to the game I was expecting and in this case, that's a bad thing.  Don't come into this game thinking its a free roam multiple choice adventure where you play the Antichrist, no, rather its a very linear, do it this way or not at all, bore of a game. There is no deviation of choice, there is no abuse of demonic powers, just very sepcific ways you have to kill people placed in an open world to give you the illusion of choice when really it just pads the game out to make it seem like its worth a whopping $20 dollars. This game is not worth its full price or even on sale, its worth a dollar, because this isn't really a game: its an interactive movie. Go watch the Omen, its a superior expeirence, and make sure its the original and not the remake.  The negatives aside, the deaths were amusing once in awhile and I had more fun donig chores and exploring around the house then I had fun playing the main story.  2/10, take your money else where.
885	1	a	666
887	1	a	If you're an antichrist you'll enjoy it - If not you still will, but feel kinda sorry in the inside ;)
889	1	a	This game is very funny especially when you are with friends... Very nice graphics and music.
891	1	a	Woo
893	1	a	Now I played it twice, it is so good. A super nice story and excellent graphics. The Tasks are really difficult sometimes, but then when you see the animation of the person who died, you feel already better :D. A must play game!!!
895	1	a	Woo
897	1	a	I have a lot of hours recorded in this game. On this, on other (old) accounts.  Why? Because it is simply amazing. I can do many things in it. Actually this is game where little kid Lucius, one sadistic little manipulative being is loved :3 (illuminati xD)  This is a fun dark game, thats build on evil.  When stuck in tasks, you have to think. That's also great thing, cuz u are helping ur brain. In this game, you also learn a lot of things.  The voice acting is not that good, so i think it's about 8/10. Voice acting and lipsync often failes. With fun, this is also one 'MORBID' game.  Most of the time, you have no idea what to do 'cuz there is no hints where to go. Huuuge house sometimes becomes boring, when u have to wander around it over and over. Can't kill how u wants. Anyways, i recommend this game from heart, everyone should play it !
899	1	a	Enjoyed every minute of it.    Hope I am not going to hell for playing this game :D   
901	1	a	Got it for free... So..  10/10 Would farm cards again.
903	1	a	Enjoyed this game a lot, as it reminded me of a film series called 'The Omen' which I particularly enjoyed. This game's practically a movie tie-in! Loved gaining the powers and using them to brutally or carefully murder all of the house's occupants. However, I did have to look up the next step in certain chapters using a guide, as the notebook tips can sometimes be incredibly vague, or not show up at all. This game is not without its glitches. Still, I enjoyed it and would recommend it.
300	0	a	This game is like a day in my life. So I find it boring.
905	1	a	COOL BOY AND THE BAD BOY
907	1	a	Epic game. I fu**ing love it ^^
304	0	a	While the gameplay is fun, there just isn't enough of it. There are far too many cutscenes in this game.
909	1	a	Super uber game to play if your not a lill pusi.
911	1	a	  nice but the game dont let do things on ur way
307	0	a	This is my revew on Lucius and I have to give it a 4/10 because there are bugs and alot of them and thats not really a bad thing because only one is game breaking and thats only happens for in my words the better ending. As for the other bugs they just break the immersion of the game. Also at almost random the frame rate would heavaly drop to almost a frame per second and everything would come to a crawl. Also the game has a hard time at really telling you what you really need to do and at times I had to use Youtube to finish some chapters because of how poorly the game told me on what i had to do.  On the other hand the game is kinda boring 'unless if you like games like this' the cutscenes are well done, and for the most part the voice acting is good. Sadly I really cant recommend this game unless its on sale because in a way the game gets you to kinda want to kill off the people in it other then your mother, your first victim, and the butler other then that the people you kill kinda had it coming.
913	1	a	+good storyline +cinematic insertions +interesting achievements -a very hard game for those who are not familiar with the genre 'quest' -booring gameplay  -a lot of bugs but I recommend it
310	0	a	The idea of this game is not bad, but very boring is implementation. I would like to sleep when it is played.
311	0	a	An extremely novel game in overall concept. Unfortunately, while the concept feels like it should be akin to an open-ended level from one of the Hitman games, the result is more like a series of finnicky, overly precise puzzles that rule out perfectly valid solutions in favor of one inexplicably correct path. The end result is just some of the worse sins of adventure game logic applied to murdering people with satanic powers - which makes that great idea a lot less fun than it should be.
915	1	a	It has a good story; It has a awesome soundtrack; It has a creepy atmosphere; It has interesting objectives; It is on Halloween 2014 SALE!!!!!! Grab it now!
312	0	a	I got this for 99 cents Just watch a cringe compilation video for free
917	1	a	i was peeking throw a hole in the wall staring at a woman in a tub she was naked 100/90 will replay that mission oh and this room uncle tom is ♥♥♥♥ing again you get to see i was all over that but i said to my self let it be................... ;_: i cri evy time
313	0	a	It's ok... 8/15
314	0	a	satans spawn mwhahahahaaa ! shame there is only one way to complete puzzles, I strongly recomend the second one over this.
315	0	a	I will admit I haven't played the game very far in (as far as I can tell), but it just felt bland. The first few kills had no challenge to them, as the game basically told me what to do. Then the next one, the butcher, found me in a room with no intuitive way to kill him at all as far as I could tell. I looked up a guide and without giving spoilers, it didn't feel creative or fun. Sure, it may sound like I want this game to both be easy and hard all at once, but quite frankly, if the in game journal didn't tell me how to beat the first kills, I probably would have wandered around this massive house even longer than I did. This game was advertised as being some interesting psychological thriller where I get to plot my family's demise and frame victims, but I didn't feel in control of my gameplay experience at all. I got a game that said 'click this, put this here, someone dies', and if that's what I wanted out of a game, I'd have just downloaded The Sims and lit a house on fire.
316	0	a	  Cool concept. A point and click adventure game where you are the child of Lucifier sent to destroy everyone in your mansion. However, it isn't executed all that well. There is only one way to solve puzzles that require specific items and actions which are far too unclear. Also a lot of the time the game becomes 'click the correct pixel'. AI is also basically nonexistent. NPCs only walk along predefined paths and constantly get stuck.
919	1	a	I have a lot of hours recorded in this game. On this, on other (old) accounts.  Why? Because it is simply amazing. I can do many things in it.

Anyways, i recommend this game from heart, everyone should play it !
317	0	a	This game is not God awful, but it's not very good, either. I would only recommend it if it were on sale.  Lucius spends most of his time murdering innocent people in his (easy to get lost in) mansion. Each chapter is a new person to kill. Gameplay is completely linear. You cannot decide to kill the maid right now and kill the mechanic next and then your mother. You also don't get any freedom in deciding how anybody dies. The game does at least have some creative (somewhat unrealistic) deaths, though, it's sorta cool to see somebody's face get sawn open.  Each chapter requires you to kill each individual in a *very* specific way. You can usually get a good idea what the game wants you to do (poison, nail guns, revolvers...) but you may have trouble figuring out exactly how the game wants you to accomplish your task and you will likely need to refer to a guide to figure the exact actions the game wants you to take. It's annoying that it's not more clear.  Another con to this game is the fact that you cannot save in the middle of a chapter, which compounds the previous issue I have with this game. You are undoubtedly having trouble figuring out the exact steps the game wants you to take, so every time you mess up and get a game over (which can be pretty easy to get) you get to start the *entire* level over, re-picking up items and getting back to the point where you can try to experiment and see what needs to be done, just to get another game over and do it all over again. It's very tiresome.  The powers could have been done a bit better. The mind control power is rather obscure, you can't just mind control someone to take your gun and go shoot somebody else, (That would be fun!) all you can really do with it is pick a person and pick an object to interact with it. You'll need to place items from your inventory somewhere in the environment first, that that threw me off the first couple of times. The telekinesis also controls really really badly. One kill in particular in the bathroom is super super hard to pull off. Luckily it lets you try multiple times very easily but considering how badly the telekinesis controls I wish it would just have activated the kill once you got close enough; you've figured out the exact actions the game wants you to take, and that's all this game really is.  You also have to avoid getting caught and stealth doesn't work the way you might think. This isn't like Thief where sitting in the shadows means you are unseen, being stealthy just means, once again, taking a path or doing some extra action that the game very specifically wants you to do in order to be unseen, though the memory wipe power is very useful for this.  There's not a whole lot of thinking you get to do yourself in order to continue murder people without getting caught. It's a shame; before I got this game I was thinking you had to constantly think one step ahead of the detective to keep getting away with murder but the game will always hold your hand and say 'You'll have to not be seen here,' 'Hide evidence here,' and 'It doesn't matter if this person sees you anymore, because you're about to kill him.'  The graphics are alright, they can be a little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sometimes. The game has some minor little glitches in it as well but nothing to ruin your experience or figure out how to work around. The story is pretty dull and the characters are not very engaging (though you are going to kill them all anyway.) I do really like the music.  The clunky and disappointing end bosses are a perfect representation of this entire game. If you like the concept and want to see what having some devil powers are like, get this game on sale. You can have a bit of fun with it, but it's definitely not worth $19.99.
921	1	a	I TOTALLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME BEST GAME VEVER 10/10
318	0	a	Lucius was a fun game but at times it felt more like a chore to complete this game. While the story was entertaining it was a little bland and the only thing that made up for this were the innovative kills and humor in said kills. Not only did the story struggle to entertain me, but the constant running around the house to find the most minute details aggrevated me to the point of looking at walkthroughs to find what I missed and where to go. I really wanted to enjoy Lucius and on some level I did, but if I were to give a rating it would be a 6.5/10. I think it didn't live up to what it could have been. I'm kind of in the middle about this game. Be warned that you may spend a lot of time roaming around wondering where to go.
923	1	a	Ever want to play as a demon child. ♥♥♥♥ Yeah! Kill all the people!
925	1	a	most of the time when i buy a game similer to this i think i wasted my money but with this game i made the right choice the player plays as a ten year old boy whear u are the devils son and if yore a strong beliver of god this game is not for u it is very satanic but still a good game i give it 8
927	1	a	Murdered a lot of people in a house over the course of several months. Went home and decided to play Lucius.   It's pretty good.
319	0	a	This game is so broken jfc
320	0	a	Do not buy this game. Trust me, it is not worth the 20 dollars. Only buy this game if it's extremely cheap on sale or you really wamt to play it for yourself. Even then, you will only be provided slight entertainment. You've been warned, I'm not entirely sure why this game has such high praise.
929	1	a	I bought this on sale and got 10 hours of entertainment. The deaths are creative and gruesome but it's a shame there is only one for each target, this considerably reduces any replayability. What a shame there isn't a level editor.
321	0	a	Just couldn't stick with it. Cool concept though.
931	1	a	That so.... interesting
933	1	a	if i say that this game is awesome im wierd?  what ever it wont affect you...its just a game  66/6 would hail Satan again! ... im screwd :')
935	1	a	do you like games? do you like hitler? do you like games that the main charater is hitler as a child? if so you should seriously get his game! very educational
937	1	a	Although the story is just filled with plot holes and therefore unimaginable, I did enjoy the concept. The cinematopgraphy was incredible and a joy to view (just look at the screenshots I took), however they were unsupported by poor voice acting throughout. The only voice actor I found believable was the actor playing Will.   Further, the games way of giving you a certain item to display hints on your hud was flawed as it didn't just show you hints specificially for the mission you were on, but instead, (I kid you not), it showed you hints for future missions aswell creating total confuson.   An example of a plot hole I identified: -There is no way Lucius' parents are fine with never hearing Lucius' voice before, actually no one should be. However, they live day to day fine with it. Further, everyone in the house doesn't seen affected by the murders in the manor expect for the mother displaying a natural character arc.   TL;DR: +Great game, great cutscenes, interesting concept - Poor voice acting, flawed help system, can't sympathise with characters due to lack of intentions and character arc.  
323	0	a	I really anticipated this game ever since it was first announced. I waited for it to be released. And then it did, and the reviews were not kind. I thought I will still like it, until I started the game. 19 minutes later I wrote this review.  It was the most boring opening I have ever seen. The background music was the most uninspired I have ever heard. The voice acting was jarring at best. Stiff and emotionless. The writing lies somewhere between banal and cliche, at times unapologetically indifferent, or unapologetically dumbass, for the lack of a better word. A woman died and the police concluded it was heart attack, and the detective who just arrived concurred, stating that it was typical of women her age, before he even set foot into the house. That was all I could take before I shut down the game.  Controls were unintuitive. Explanations were a mystery in itself. I spent 3 minutes trying to figure out how to use a lock when you don't have a way to select it even when you see it on screen. In the previous step, the game told you to pick it up, then it instructed you to 'holster' it. Then the game asked you to use it, without explaining that you need to 'unholster' it before you can use it. Brilliant.   In the 19 minutes that I have played the game, I have probably played it for 5 minutes. I spent the other 14 waiting for the game to load, watching slow moving cutscenes that tells you what you already know, listening to words that hardly inspires, instill fear, or peak my interest in any way. It was more interesting watching paint dry.  Also, instead of opting for a first person perspective, the developers wanted to replicate a movie feel and go third person instead. I know, they are trying to recreate the tricycle scene of The Shinning, but ever wondered how awkward it is to control someone in-game like that? And that's not to mention how they always have to center the camera looking directly at Lucius, who admittedly looked creepy in the game. It's a wonder then, how no one suspected him.  Do I recommend this game? No. Will I continue to play it till the end? No. Will I buy Lucius II? No. Should you play this game? Depends. If you are patient and don't care about quality as much, you may enjoy it. If you are critical like I am, you will balk at the notion that this game was even made.
324	0	a	If I could remove this game from my library I would :cgpout:. The game story isn't new I know but I guess it's hard to be this much evil even in a virtual world, not that anyone is absolutely good, but still this is just too much. I do like to play a villain from time to time. It's fun and thrilling. They usually have a nice background story attached to them, too. Lucius lacks the depth and roundness of a villain character.It focuses more on evil for the sake of being evil and no reason at all besides that.You play as a six year old hell-spawn who is bent on mercilessly torturing and killing other NPCs. The game gives the player the tools to creatively excute the non-suspecting NPCs. I'm only not recommending the game because of its emphasis on the game major source of fun which is killing.  You can be evil and wreak havoc without spilling one drop of neither real nor virtual blood, that's creativity in its finest!
939	1	a	A-MAZE-ING! You are the little kid from The Omen. It's brilliant.
325	0	a	just dont waste your money on this game
941	1	a	Fantastic game!
327	0	a	It had so much potential and fails miserably.
943	1	a	When I first heard that they had finally decided to make Little Nicky into a video game, I had my reservations. I assumed it'd basically parrot back a bunch of snarky remarks from the film and follow the same [Oddball Character Introduced &gt; Conflict Arises &gt; Oddball Not Such A Bad Guy &gt; Oddball Makes Friends &gt; Oddball Gives Up &gt; Friends Rescue Oddball &gt; Everyone Falls In Love With Everyone] plotline that every other Adam Sandler movie has followed. But the creator gives the story an interesting twist! (Except the ending. Your Uncle Tom has sex with everyone in the mansion and then the game ends, so that's kind of the same.) But in this game Adam Sandler actually plays a role other than Guy With Fart Machine! In this game, Adam Sandler is Malcolm McDowell. First, the conflict arises. Your jerk of a Dad, like, wants you to rule hell and stuff. But instead of being all, like, 'BUT DAAAAD I DON'T WANNA RULE HELL! I WANNA PLAY WITH MY FART MACHINE!' Adam Sandler's all like 'This works for me. Killing idiots is fun. Does this humanitarian gesture come with a dental plan?' Then comes the part where Adam Sandler WOULD prove he's a good guy. And then, this is crucial now...he's NOT a good guy. He starts killing people and they, like, want to be friends and stuff because he's got, like, a moonpie face. But Malcolm McDowell Sandler is like ADAM SANDLER DON'T NEED NO MAN and like stuffs people in light sockets and stuff. Oh my god it's so cool. And your grandpa's all like FAMILY BONDING IS IMPORTANT and Adam Sandler's like I AIN'T NO GRANDPA'S BOY and guts him like a saggy skinned old fish. Then would come the part where he would give up because the cops and church are like 'I've never really been able to actually CONVICT anyone of a crime, but...process of elimination tells me that you must be the killer since, like...errbuddy ded lol' but does Adam Sandler give up and wait for his friends to save him? NO. Old Sandler might, but McDowell Sandler's crazy like a fox! He's all like GET IN THAT LIGHT SOCKET. And then the devil's all like BRO...I RESPEK YOU and then the game ends and you're, like, funny like Adam Sandler, but also not a ♥♥♥♥♥.  In conclusion; this Adam Sandler is cooler than real Adam Sandler. So if you don't like Adam Sandler movies, that's ok because this one's better. If you do like Adam Sandler movies, but also liked The Happening, then this is good too because New Malcolm Sandler also has these, like, tree powers than let him tell disco fans and college kids to put their faces in woodchippers.  8/10 Needs more Adrian.
945	1	a	If you're looking for a positive review, then you're in the wrong place, HOWEVER, if you're here for a tremendous chicken Stir Fry recipe, THEN LOOK NO FURTHER!  - Serves 4 - 10 mins to prepare and 10 mins to cook - 325 calories / serving - Healthy  INGREDIENTS:  - 1 orange, zested and juiced - 2tbsp soy sauce - 2tbsp sesame oil - 250g (8oz) tender stem broccoli - 5cm (2in) piece root ginger - 1tbsp sunflower oil - 1 garlic clove, finely sliced - 1 red pepper, deseeded and thinly sliced - 150g Straight To Wok Noodles - 400g (13oz) chicken fillet, cut into thin slices  METHOD  Step 1 - Mix together the orange zest and juice, soy sauce and sesame oil and set aside.

947	1	a	Very entertaining game!  Visuals are very decent: 6.5/10  Music is great: 10/10  Story is all right: 9/10 (if you like horror/mystery genre) Voice acting is good: 7/10 The animations and the cutscenes is where this game falls short: 3/10 (bad lip syncing, awkward hand gesticulations and head bobbing, unpolished facial expressions: all these make this game a parody, not a horror)  Gameplay is solid, I didn't encounter any bugs. This is basically a puzzle game when you're looking for ways to eliminate people by making it seem like an accident. The gameplay is very linear, you have only one way to make it right. I can't rate it, this kind of games is not my usual cup of tea.  Overall I enjoyed the game, but mainly for its story aspect, we had quite a few laughs with my girlfriend while watching the cut-scenes or observing interactions between NPCs.  There is very little replay value though, once you completed the story and know how to solve the puzzles.  My personal score: 6/10. Recomended if on sale under $10.

The name of a game should be 'Find an item in tremendously large mansion'  Same issue like with Legend of Grimrock II - unintuitively hidden quest/puzzles/items are just a fun killers.  what a shame, this game could be such a great experience

Visuals are very decent: 6.5/10  Music is great: 10/10  Story is all right: 9/10 (if you like horror/mystery genre) Voice acting is good: 7/10 The animations and the cutscenes is where this game falls short: 3/10 (bad lip syncing, awkward hand gesticulations and head bobbing, unpolished facial expressions: all these make this game a parody, not a horror)  Gameplay is solid, I didn't encounter any bugs. This is basically a puzzle game when you're looking for ways to eliminate people by making it seem like an accident. The gameplay is very linear, you have only one way to make it right. I can't rate it, this kind of games is not my usual cup of tea.  Overall I enjoyed the game, but mainly for its story aspect, we had quite a few laughs with my girlfriend while watching the cut-scenes or observing interactions between NPCs.  There is very little replay value though, once you completed the story and know how to solve the puzzles.  My personal score: 6/10. Recomended if on sale under $10.

969	1	a	Soothing music and backdrop 11/10 Recommended for casual gamers
340	0	a	I am not impressed. It gets pretty boring and repetitive pretty fast. Including the idea is rather bland, simple minded, unoriginal, and many aspects of the game are very dull. Many of its 'missions' have too little guidance and leaves too much for you to figure out on your own by some miracle. And there are also poor graphics which should not effect gameplay however in numerous occasions graphics glitches occur and materials often clip. There is alot that needed to be worked on in this game, it may have some potential to be decent...somewhere in there, but I don't see it. I strongly recomend that you do not play this game. Honestly, this game should be free, there is absolutely no reason at all for it to be $ 9.99. If you were to pay one dollar for this, you would be paying two dollars too much.

344	0	a	Lousy controls, repetitive missions, bugs, underwhelming nudity, welcome to hell….
345	0	a	Lucius starts out promising, but completely fails to deliver any interesting gameplay. The entire game feels like a tutorial, holding your hand and slowly introducing new concepts on the way. Every 'puzzle' is either incredibly obvious or makes no sense, but is either way handed to you. The various powers you are given are only useful in very specific situations and sometimes plain don't work since the puzzle does not call for them. All in all, highly disappointing from something so promising.
346	0	a	So this is what it's like to control a whale.  It's creative, but what it really boils down to is a 'Use the hints to press E on something' simulator.
347	0	a	Lucius is a slightly interesting, yet generally bad game. The story centers around Lucius, the devil's alleged son who has been asked to murder people in demonic ways. It's not combat-oriented, you just cause accidents to hurt/kill people.  It's new, but also quite bad. The story is lame, and the dialogue is drawn out and boring. Gameplay itself is excruciatingly awful. Killing random people by locking them in a freezer is not only unnecessarily gruesome, it's also not fun at all.  Don't get me started on the animations and graphics. Not that it's like a bad port, but they just did a terrible job modeling the people; mouths and voices are also not in sync.  Overall, a waste of my money.

353	0	a	Don't touch this game, unless it's a few bucks. It has some bad optimzation issues, boring/tedious gameplay that just isn't fun. It's a unique game, but there isn't much there to warrant a play-through.

981	1	a	For those seeking to establish a religious career.
983	1	a	Well I can't really look at this game objectively since I watched a playthrough first but I love the game's story. I mean who wouldn't wanna be an innocent little kid murdering everyone around you without getting suspected? xD (Just kidding)  Anyway I love it, my kind of game! :)
357	0	a	yay im son of satan this is going to be fun!....... god this game sucks..

359	0	a	This game is so bad.  DONT BUY THIS GAME!
360	0	a	Lucius is a game about a little boy named Lucius who, on his 6th birthday, is approached by Satan, who is apparently his father. Lucius then begins killing inhabitants of the mansion in different ways in order to give his father souls. I was very excited to play this game, especially when I bought it on sale for $1.49, but I ended up disappointed. I felt that the storyline was very generic, and since I played with a controller, I also felt that the controls were sort of awkward, particularly when using telekinesis. One of the things I found most annoying was that the instructions on what to do were sometimes very vague. For instance, when asked to take the trash out, not only would I have to go searching for the trash, but also for a place to take it to. Then at one point the game hinted that I should find some way to mess with one of the inhabitants, but I spent 30 minutes running around having no clue how to do it. On top of that, the map was sort of confusing and the game crashed the first time I tried to change the resolution. This game is really fun whenever I know what I'm doing, but it gets frustrating when I spend thirty minutes looking for one item or place because I'm not very observant. The graphics are really good but I wouldn't spend more than $5 on this game.
361	0	a	They took my ball

1001	1	a	Pretty interesting concept
1003	1	a	its Unical game
366	0	a	Negatives:  - Graphics quality &amp; frame rate. - voice acting - gameplay and level design.  I paid around £1 in a bundle acceptable price.
367	0	a	Lucius is an unpolished game with a unique setting. The game is totally linear and there is no freedom to try different things. It's no Hitman. It plays more like a point'n click game so there is absolutely no challenge at all once you know what to do. The puzzles were either very easy or just frustrating imo. I wouldn’t call any of them “challenging.  I ran into some bad AI interactions and minor bugs as well. The npcs repeated the same lines over and over again and they often spoke on top of each other. Towards the end it got annoying to hear Nancy (the main character’s mom) constantly ask you to do laundry when I had already completed the chore very early on. The game crashed a few times and one time I clipped through the staircase wall to the outside of the manor. I also ran into many minor flaws which made the game feel unpolished.  Still, it was a somewhat enjoyable experience and worth the 1,89€ I paid for it. In my opinion you should only consider buying Lucius if it’s on big sale and the premise sounds interesting to you.
368	0	a	fun game but sadly not worth it. too much lag in game even with everything on low and im above the requirements. not happy at all.

372	0	a	This game felt like it was made in a few hours. It's just really, really bad. If you want to kill people in more creative ways, I'd highly recommend the Hitman-series instead. I got it for 3 bucks though, so thank god for that. I also got some of the money back by selling the Trading Cards.
1013	1	a	Great concept, graphics for a game like this it's okay. You are Lucius, a little boy and a killer. It's like (Hitboy) ;) and movies like 'The Omen'  You can open every drawer and cabinet, turn on/off every light. You can unlock 5 specials like telekinesis. You have an inventory and you can combine stuff. People talk to you and if you listen you can get infos about your next kill. If you finishes a job you get a final sequence with your kill which is mostly very violently and brutal bloody. Not for kids... but with kids. XD   -Points for too lineary story. Every kill has only 1 solution. Find this solution is sometimes really hard. You have to check out the big house for every little piece you maybe need. Try everything and you will find your way.  Another -Point for the ending. 1st it was terrible hard, 2nd it was harder if you dont know what to do and 3rd, it was too short. Final Fight and immediatly Credits.  Price is ok and i was entertained. 7/10
1015	1	a	Murder and boobs
1017	1	a	Indie Homicidal Delight  There is no reason not to get this on sale, unless you're under 18 years old.
1019	1	a	If you loved the movie The Omen, be it the original or the 2006 remake, then you will most likely love Lucius.  The game and story are extremely linear, and by that I mean that there are zero deviations whatsoever. So don't go in expecting you're going to sandbox murder people as a kid. You'll always be within the mansion or in the garden outside, so deal with it and the lack of side missions. There also isn't much in the way of music, but that's okay; it makes it easier to throw on some metal to set the mood.  Now, the different methods in which you execute people are absolutely visceral, however pre-conceived they may be. You get to eff up a ton of people in the game, and each person dies their own unique death. There's a decent amount of challenge involved during some of the kill scenarios, especially more towards the end of the game. Stealth is key to not getting caught at times, while other times you simply have to figure out how to lure folks to their demise. Did I mention your father, Satan, will visit you from time to time and bestow new abilities unto you for doing his bidding?  The controls can be somewhat clunky at times but it's not too awful. It's a minor inconvenience and a small price to pay for a game as unique as Lucius. It's a total Omen simulator, from start to finish. The price of $10.99 CAD is a steal for a game that will last you a good 15-20 hours, although Lucius is found in bundles quite often and has been known to go on sale for a whopping $1.00. So ask yourself... do you like horror, murder and gore? If you answered yes, this game is for you.   Rating:  4.0/5.0  - Excellent, highly worth playing.
375	0	a	I was not happy with my old review, so I am making another one. Lucius is a bad game. Lucius is a VERY bad game. In Lucius, your objective is to kill a specific target without being caught, Like in Hitman. However, in Lucius you are given no choice as to how to kill your target. There is only one way to take out your target, and its usually the most obscure, annoying, and hidden way you could possibly imagine. What also sucks is how you never get to 'experiment' to learn your surroundings. Walk up to some guy with a gun and shoot him? Instant game over. You dont get to see the reaction of what you have done, you just get that satisfying 'GAME OVER' we all love. It is also a buggy mess, ive had to repeat levels numerous times because a bug occured making the level unbeatable. Dont waste your time or money.

397	0	a	This game lacks absolutely on being funny. The big problem here is that you have ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA of what to do and you find yourself wandering like an idiot in the house.

Don't buy.

1047	1	a	Good fun, although pretty buggy at times...   
1049	1	a	Completely evil and completely twisted 10/10
1051	1	a	Lucius may have it’s flaws, yes. The graphics and the voicework needed more work. The gameplay can get boring after some time and doesn’t leave a lot of room for your own choice but all in all I actually felt like an evil little boy. I actually felt like I was playing the game of The Omen and I had a lot of fun in the process of killing my new virtual family. So if you are a little sadistic like me and liked The Omen and games like Manhunt, Lucius is definitly worth picking up.
1053	1	a	It's creepy, satan talks to you in your room, and you get to kill people in all sorts of fun ways. I've always wanted to play it cause it looked cool and I am not disappointed.
1055	1	a	Bought this one on a whim, tempted by its description. No regrets, lads. Lucius has this nice feeling to it. Something like first Mafia and Max Payne 2. There's no shooting and you play as a six year old spawn of Lucifer born on 6 6 1966(jesus...) but resemblance in serving the plot and world is collosal. Gameplay straight out of Hitman series with some supernatural powers.  Had a lot of pleasure playin this, it was a one day blast without a rest. Not every day you are the bad guy without morals, or are you?
1057	1	a	Near-broken game design is saved by a fantastic environment and the novelty of the story. Play it, but play it with a walkthrough.
1059	1	a	Excellent Finnish depressiveness simulator.
1061	1	a	Love this game. It has a few tricky moments and the occasional tough puzzle, but any game like this should in my opinion.  I'm excited to play the second one!
1063	1	a	Needs quick saves as i am stuck trying to sneak around in the dark to find my Grandfather . YES , i did it .....nope , i must sneak to get super glue and back . Grrrrrrrr . Overall , it has been fun
1065	1	a	This is a short, demented puzzle game where you play as the son of the devil as he goes about his father's requests to kill off everyone he knows. Surprisingly challenging puzzles can be find here. Clever levels in general, lots of achievements, and a decent sized map to explore. Definitely pick it up on sale!
1067	1	a	This is a really fun game that gives you the feeling of being the bad guy. You do the harm, you are the charackter that all the others should fear. To me, this was very exiting. I have never played a game like this before. Absolutly worth a try, you will absolutly love it!
1069	1	a	An interesting game concept; play as a demonic possessed kid and kill off the household. It's kinda like playing the Sims if you were Satan.  You free roam around the house looking for a way to kill your next target, set everything up, then let the brutal cutscene commence. Most of the puzzles involve just setting up the murder in the house, which the game kinda helps you with so its not like you run around clicking everything. Some of the murders are a bit mild, like you just poisen them and watch them die. Then you get to most of the others which escalate to the level of sawing a guys face in half with a saw. So if you like gore, this might get you off a bit.  Though the game is short and can be completed pretty quickly, its best to wait for a sale to buy. Even though the game is kinda amusing and interesting, it's content is still not worth $20.
1071	1	a	Darkness, evil and fun make this game a fantastic play. I love the aspect of being the evil protagonist along with kill everyone without getting caught. Highly recommended play, I only wish there were more games like this out there.
1073	1	a	A really fun game, there are some bugs... But worth the money
1075	1	a	The graphics are ok. The plot it's pretty nice. It's cool that you have to do bad things and kill people to be more powerfull. The SFX and BG Music are good. The movements are kinda weird... Lucius looks like he is walking on a slippery floor
1077	1	a	This game is awesome! it has a good atmosphere, and the puzzels are amazing! it kind of reminds me of the movie The Omen... great movie BTW it has Omen (being a 5 year old boy) and Lucius (a 6 year old boy) killing other people, but Lucius has Lucifers powers. And i like that a lot lol. but if a 6 year old with Lucifers powers ever tries to kill me IRL i would probally cry ;-; but like i said, Amazing game and i would really recommend that you play this! &lt;3
1079	1	a	I play as the Devil's son.  Yum, yum.
1081	1	a	This game is not about graphics nor about how long or short it is. The game is set in the perfect mood. One thing I don't like its the idea of how slow you are even when running. I can say this game at least gets a 8/10 and that's because it can also be a tad boring at times. The ending of the game was not cool, mostly because you are left hanging with the 'what happened?' and it isn't funny. But over all, I believe you should give it a try
1083	1	a	Get to play as Satan's son. 11/10 - IGN
1085	1	a	Lucius has a very interesting concept behind it. The idea of playing the monster that is murdering people without others finding out about it is very brutal but a cool idea. However, this game has multiple problems with controls and communication. This causes simple puzzles to be both difficult to figure out and difficult to execute once you know the solution.   Overall, I would NOT recommend Lucius, but I support the ideas behind it and look forward to another game like it that has better puzzle and control design.
1087	1	a	If you have ever been curious about what an antichrist would be like as a child, Here ya go. Seriously!
1089	1	a	I loved this game since I saw a youtuber play it and just had to play it myself. the only small problem I had was figuring out what to do at times
1091	1	a	i absolutley loved this game it was a puzzle and a action but a bit gory not recommended for some one with a weak stoumach but another good thing in the game was the enviroment there is a huge mansion and then the yard and all the rooms i mean like you have to kill your teacher so you have to talk to people to get stuff to kill your teacher the sneaking is a bit hard tho if you are bad at that sort of stuff(like me)but ya a great game over all
1093	1	a	Lucius is a game very heavily based on the movie 'The Omen'. It's a great game that places you in the role of the devil's child Lucius. Despite it looking like a horror game, it is not really scary since you are the threat that's killing people on the go. You get a big mansion with a lot of staff in which you will kill them one by one in seperate chapters.  Overall the game feels like a puzzle game, and a pretty tough game at that. I really enjoyed playing it. I'm just going to list some positives and negatives below:  YES Great idea for a game Big location Gruesome deaths A lot of backstory on most characters Awesome demonic powers So much death!  NO A lot of bugs and glitches Controls make you feel like you are driving a tank instead of controlling a 6-year old Bad voice acting for some characters Not scary Very linear  Despite the games awesomeness, there are a lot of bugs and glitches. In the second chapter, the mom kept walking into the door leasing outside, despite it being locked. Also, the telekineses power is very hard to use most of the time. There have also been a couple of instances in which I hard to start a chapter again because people would not die when they were supposed to, or stayed put when they were supposed to wak out of the room.   Despite all of this, Lucius is an awesome little game that puts you in the bad guy's shoes. A part 2 is on its way, so let's hope the developers have learned from their mistakes and will release an awesome sequal!
1095	1	a	Impressive game, which puts you in a skin of a child posessed by the devil. Child needs to give souls to his father - Lucifer, by creating 'accidents' that take lives of people around big mansion he is living. It is very cruel game, that shows every death in slow-mo and with maximum details. And it purely unique and very fun to play. Beaten it in one evening.
1097	1	a	I love this game,is so perfect,but the final....I wanted more
1099	1	a	The premise for this game is pretty effing fantastic. You're the antichrist. Reborn into the child of a wealthy couple. Hellbent on doing the devil's bidding and fulfilling your prophecy as a killer, you set about racking up the numbers by offing kitchen staff and houseguests alike. Highly recommended to game collectors.
1101	1	a	Lucius is a game that puts you in control of a child, the child of Lucifer to be specific. Without spoiling the story, you are the antichrist, making sacrifices to Satan in fun, creative, and very gruesome ways.   *Gameplay*
1103	1	a	Absoutly Stunning Creative Ways to kill people.
1105	1	a	Best to play this when no one is home. killing people 10/10 gameplay 10/10 using various items in mysterious ways to kill interesting 10/10 movement 8/10 (game gave me headache from glitchyness in tight conrers occasionally)  I reccomnend getting onsale as Lucious 2 recently came out but this game is very good too.  not as easy as you would think.
1107	1	a	To be honest I didn't expect much from this game, but I was pleasantly surprised! The graphics, gameplay, BGM and voice acting is average (the voice actress for Lucius's mum was pretty good though!), however the concept of playing the Antichrist made this a very entertaining experience.  Imagine this game as a horror movie, it would be very scary and suspenseful with all the mysterious unexplained deaths. However, playing as Lucius it was up to me to make these deaths happen and not be caught in the process.   Grab this game when it's on sale!
408	0	a	I'm slightly depressed I actually spent money on this game. Why... why would a second game be made.
1109	1	a	You play Lucius, on a quest to grow your powers and please your hellish father by giving him souls.. And of course you need to find ways to release those souls!   I enjoyed most of the puzzles and challenges to accomplish this but lost patience with a few. Some of them were obvious but still left a deliciously evil satisfaction when you completed the puzzle. One or two left me without a clue where to begin.. This may have been more me.   The game takes place entirely in the mansion and leaves you feeling lost when you first start to explore (you get a map though!... and a tricycle in which to travel faster at one point too). It felt very open, but the gameplay and story was still linear. You had opportunities to find some objects before they were needed so this was nice during the course of exploring and looking for what you actually did need.  The voice acting was alright, but the faces of the characters were completely wooden. Lucius was completely emotionless.. more statue than evil boy.. But maybe this is part of the 'evil boy' look? I thought Lucifer (wooden) face and voice were the best 3:)  There were only two or three points where being able to run/move quickly and aim correctly were critical... It was a small very minor exercise in frustration to get these parts done right but still done easily. Lucius' running and riding the trike were about as good as you could expect for a puzzle game.  I would probably get this while on sale vs a full price, but if you enjoy short puzzle games like this, then it might be worth your full $19.99. I am definitely excited for the next Lucius game. I hoping the developers add on this and bring us a smoother moving and more complex story with even more challenging puzzle.   8 of 10
1111	1	a	Got pushed outside of front door on last mission. Last boss(?) couldn't get me.  10/10
1113	1	a	Definitely worth getting, its like a puzzel game, but you kill people.
1115	1	a	Oh man I just love this game to Death (literally ;) )   You're a little boy going around a huge gorgious mansion getting souls for your daddy Lucifer? Sounds gruesome, it really is though. But for a murdering type game I find this rather fantastic, can't stop playing it.
1117	1	a	Such a great game
1119	1	a	It's better conceptually than it is in execution. The house is in essentially the same state for a majority of the game, and even though months have passed by in game, some characters stay in the exact same spot saying the exact same things until you end up killing them. It's a good thing that figuring out the murder puzzles and be quite fun and challenging at times.  Lucius reminds of the old flash games I'd play, but the graphics and mechanics are obviously way better. Much like those games, though, I wouldn't expect to get more than a day's worth of fun out of it.  Try it out. Kill some people. Witness the storyline. Expect to uninstall it because there's not that much replay value. It's worth it for a run through, though.
1121	1	a	a good way to spend your time being evil 7/10
1123	1	a	666
1125	1	a	The Power of Christ Compels You! - To buy this game.. like now. No seriously its fun!
1127	1	a	Rly nice game
1129	1	a	This game was made for me.
1131	1	a	You can still play this if you belive in god  LOL
1133	1	a	This game centres around the mis-adventures of a sweet 6 year old boy whos life gets turned upside down.  Fun game. quite glitchy but for the price i enjoyed it. Looking forward to the sequal.
1135	1	a	yes its nice game
1137	1	a	I have enjoyed this game so far and i'm glad I bought it, but I probably only bought it because it's on sale, but either way this game is a good horror game in my opinion.
1139	1	a	An interesting game concept but it gets frustrating and tiresome at times. It's definitely something I would recommend, but only on sale.
1141	1	a	I liked this game.
412	0	a	Great idea, sub-par execution.  Also, what's with the devs adding 20 and 40 hour playtime 'achievements' to a game that takes 7 hours to complete at most? That's insane considering it has literally zero replayability. You can't even decide how to off people, it's a linear story disguised as a sand-box 'hitman'-esque game.  Perhaps the devil really is in the details?
1143	1	a	Got it on sale for $1. After playing it, I feel I would have paid up to $10; just not the normal asking price of $20. It is exactly what it says it is. A puzzle horror game putting you in the devilish shoes of a 6 year old antichrist. Pretty fun despite some flaws. Graphics aren't the best (but they work), lip sync is off sometimes during cut scenes which can take you out of the moment. Some of the acting is a little cheesy but overall good performances. One thing I wish was having more of a sandbox style for the killing. You have to kill people in very specific ways during each chapter, no choices. This is more akin to the old school point and click adventure games of the 90's (not in a bad way). I also would have liked to see a first person mode since much of your time is spend looking for items. When viewing as close as you can get in 3rd person the kids head blocks whatever the cursor is pointed at so you can't see it. All in all a fun experience. There is also a bonus game where you just try to kill priests using your fire spell, which was fun, but hard (they get into melee range and it's game over... damn crosses). Great value for the price I paid. If you enjoy old school horror movies like The Omen or Exorcist you will probably enjoy this game. Find it for $10 or less I would recommend picking it up.  If you are just looking for a slasher/shooter game go somewhere else, like I said this is a essentially a horror themed puzzle game.  Additionally they also have a sequel to this game, and it seems to have added in more open ended ways to kill people. Haven't tried it yet but thinking about checking it out.
1145	1	a	This game is a great small sandbox game, it is not open world, but more of a sandbox. You are in a mansion, and can freely move anywhere, but limited to some places based upon progression; the more you progress, the more areas you can enter. If you are in it for the story, get it. I got this for 1 dollar, and was worth it, as it only took me 4 hours to complete, the levels in between are very short and small, and I would not consider this a puzzle, since it is way too easy. This game is rated A for adults only cause well...kids shouldn't play this =P 8/10 for very short chapters.
1147	1	a	Did you ever watch that movie called The Omen? This is pretty much that.
1149	1	a	I love this game,is so perfect,but the final....I wanted more
1151	1	a	Impressive game, which puts you in a skin of a child posessed by the devil. Child needs to give souls to his father - Lucifer, by creating 'accidents' that take lives of people around big mansion he is living. It is very cruel game, that shows every death in slow-mo and with maximum details. And it purely unique and very fun to play. Beaten it in one evening.
1153	1	a	Lucius!Idon't think that is a Horror game at all,because is not scary;I think is a half adventure and half puzzle game,in fact you have to find ways to kill every member of your family with various infernal powers and objects,that sometimes are easy to find,sometimes not.  This game reminds the 'Omen' movies that are a must to watch if you like horror movies with satanic characters.  I played 10.5 hours to end the story with a bit of exploration and to complete all the second quests and,finally,I think that Lucius is a very good game to play,but not spend 20€(yes,I'm Italian :D ) to buy this game!Wait for some sales,like I did!  Thanks for the attention!Bye ;)
1155	1	a	This is a fantastic game if have ever laughed at any of the death scense from Omen or thought that the first Exorstist movie was funny for trying to be scary.
1157	1	a	Im not into horror games usually but this game I found really fun and I would recommend getting it.
1159	1	a	fun and creepy and funny-ish
415	0	a	Monotonous killings, and only a few ways to do so makes this game rather lackluster. After waking up and seeing old Satan himself telling a 10 year to go do the dirty deeds is entertaining in itself. Sadly after trying to sneak to kill someone It is dissapointing to be caught by your mom who scholds you and tells you to march right back to bed. If there were more customization options then the linear story and powers this might have done amazingly. 4 / 10
416	0	a	I find this game boring soo far soory but damn I am getting sleepy playing this. It has some sort of potential for fun game but I dunno not for me it's sketched to much, with plenty bugs which are making comedy of this. For few bucks you can try it. I will play it for few more hours, but my immersion got destroyed and story is not that engaging either.
1161	1	a	Stuck To The Wall   10/10 Would Stuck Again 👌
417	0	a	Not very fun at all. 
418	0	a	Worthless abilities, glitches everywhere, way too easy and one of the worst endings that I've ever seen.
1163	1	a	This game really warmed my heart.
419	0	a	While an interactive Omen sounds promising on paper, this game sags under the weight of bad level design and bad character models and lip syncing (not to mention some pretty uninspiring voice acting).  It's most cardinal sin of all, and the one thing the game should have going for it, is the actual kills and puzzles are straightforward and bland. This trip to hell is not worth taking.
1165	1	a	I liked this game a lot, and it reminded me of the cult classics 70's movies ''The Omen'' and ''The Exorcist''. Also, the methods of killings are original and Lucius's powers are awesome, especially mind control and combustion. To enjoy better the game while playing it, I recommend the listening of heavy metal bands who uses satanic themes (Slayer, Mercyful fate, Black Sabbath, etc.)
1167	1	a	Very cool :)
422	0	a	You play as the 6 year old spawn of Satan, and every month or so, you target a victim (well, the game targets one for you) and by ways of a puzzle you get him killed, so as to claim his soul for Satan. In return, Satan promises to make you stronger, and every once in a while will grant you a new ability or upgrade the level of one you already have. The abilities are senseless however (more on that later), and solving the puzzles so as to get to the killing or murdering is more of a chore (even if the 'rewarding cutscene' is entertaining). Speaking of chores, the game even has some for you. Luckily they don't seem to be mandatory, though the game doesn't really let you know at first. Completing enough boring chores, which will have you running an errand for someone or looking for an item you will only have the vaguest idea of where to find, would grant you presents. Which I couldn't find any use for.  The entire game is based in one big mansion (it does have a garden I guess), with some new parts of the mansion unlocking as you progress through the levels. Each time you wake up, the game gives you a new target. It's an interesting thing to call this one a horror title, because you are actually playing the horror yourself, and that doesn't help the game scare you in any way. Though some of the deaths are gruesome, the poor graphics and crippled animations almost make them funny. They're meant to be rather cringy though. The premise of the game is an interesting one, but it isn't bolstered by you playing it. The plot has something going for it with an interesting overarching theme of a detective trying to investigate what the hell is going on in the mansion, but it isn't especially good, it's just one of two things solid about this game. The other being that the voice acting is surprisingly well delivered, though it is too held back - by poor animations and character models.  The graphics are poor. Beyond outdated character models, bad lightning effects, the game is lacking in environmental shadows. The textures are at least decent. The animations are outdated, but by outdated standards, not the worst (especially the face animaitions). Sometimes they warrant a giggle or two. The biggest problem with the presentation however is to do with tonemaps, with many crushed blacks and oversaturated filters that make the game uneasy on the eyes, also during gameplay, it just doesn't look good and much of the detail is lost as a result (the problem is visible in the screenshots). No AA options is also a problem, and the game doesn't seem to support DSR.   The mansion is rather dull. You are restricted to the same, boring environment, which is rather big and confusing, with many rooms you'll find trouble keeping track of, simply filled with furniture and very little of things interesting to look at or find. The map has no useful indication of where a person is likely to be. The game does nothing to help you keep track of your objectives, or pursue them. It is a point and click puzzle in the most traditional way, with no freedom whatsoever to solving the puzzles. While that is fine, the game has some weird, or unintuitive solutions to some puzzles. Many times you'll just run around the house not sure where to go, what to do, and you will have to resort to a guide.  The abilities, and their levels, are pointless. While you can use telekinesis on objects instead of picking them up with your hand, every puzzle and every interaction relating to a puzzle is specific, you cannot decide which power to use in order to kill your victim, it's all predetermined. The game could just as well keep it more simple by tying your abilities into one button which would serve this one purpose of 'supernatural' tinkering with puzzle elements. The levels of those abilities also make no sense, there is no significance to the level of the ability you are using while solving puzzles and they are gained through story-progression anyway.  The fact that you have no freedom in solving the puzzles or killing victims in different ways is not a bad thing on its own, although that would have made the game a lot more interesting to play. The problem is that the linear puzzles put in the game are boring, and like many adventure point and clicks they suffer from not making a whole lot of sense sometimes, or not being very intuitive at least, because the solutions are so specific, having to do with items scattered around a huge mansion you'll have trouble finding.   The mechanics of the game are also cluncky, and the controls suffer from the third person perspective - you play a short character, so sometimes to use items you'd have to go into weird camera angels, making it difficult to see the item you are trying to get to. Sometimes your character blocks the view of items you are searching in or controlling, and picking things up and moving them around and all the puzzles would have been easier to control in first person view.   All in all, the game is simply sub-par on almost every level or aspect of it, disappointing in many regards and only pleasantly surprising in plot and voice acting.
1169	1	a	gameplay is not too hard and regardless of bugs and inconvinient control, the plot is easy to make me addicted. 8/10
423	0	a	good idea, poorly executed. often difficult to navigate. buggy when it comes to retention of items, progress, events, etc. poor writing and mostly poor voice acting. ending is sudden and unsatisfying, partially due to poor pacing. that said, there are definitely some cool moments scattered throughout. on occasion, the mood and environment line up just right and one has to give credit for the creativity of some of the kills. unfortunately, the puzzles are usually overly simplistic or counterintuitive and the dark atmosphere and gory spectacles seem forced at times. i could mention several specific gripes, but the first example that comes to mind is    when lucius gains the power to control fire. lucifer specifically says 'now, you don't need matches!' immediately after this, the player must light candles with matches to advance.    when combat, precision, speed, stealth, etc. are involved, the game falls short and irrevocably spoils the decent bits. cool at first glance but overall a sophomoric effort. the best part was picking up    pornographic videos and trying to show my prized copy of '♥♥♥♥♥ hunters' to my parents and housemates.   
1171	1	a	Very Good Game. Epic story! Everything is perfect except 2 achivments: Play 20 hrs and Play 40 Hrs.. There is no content to play the game for 40 hrs..
1173	1	a	It's better conceptually than it is in execution. The house is in essentially the same state for a majority of the game, and even though months have passed by in game, some characters stay in the exact same spot saying the exact same things until you end up killing them.

Expect to uninstall it because there's not that much replay value. It's worth it for a run through, though.
424	0	a	I'll recommend only if your computer is not as ♥♥♥♥ed up as mine. This game works in slow motion and the I can't do the 1st mission, which is lock the maid in the freezer, byt locking the door when she enters to clean. The game is bugged for me as she doesn't enter the freezer and stay on the door cleaning and I can't close it and lock it. If your computer is as ♥♥♥♥ed up as mine, so please do not buy it, cause it will be a waste of money. *sighs*
1175	1	a	Creative, fun and brings out the devil inside you. What else can anyone want in a game!!! 7.5/10
1177	1	a	So very interesting but buggy. You play as the Antichrist, a kid who murders everyone. It is dark and gruesome but the graphics are not amazing so the gross parts are not too bad. It's buggy as well and hard. I could not beat it without watching play throughs. All that being said it's still a super cool game pick it up at 50% off.
1179	1	a	A really good game, and very interesting as well. I plan to get the sequel.
1181	1	a	Love it a few glitches but amazing game!
426	0	a	It doesn't really give you free roam and the puzzles it wants you to solve can only be done one way and that way is the most annoying because you have to wait until your victim gives you hits like 'I'ma go fix the piano.' Not worth asking price. I believe I paid 5 dollars for it on sale. I'd wait for that again.   (Edit) now that I think about it, it was actually a gift... But it was on sale for 5 dollars at one point.
1183	1	a	The game is really short, I finished it in 2.8h, but it was really nice to play. It's hard to understand what we need to do but we always find a way.
428	0	a	This game is buged sometimes like when i had to kill Agnes. At night when i break the lamp this mother****** cop always spot me. I've spend an hour on it without succed.
1185	1	a	Low budget and somewhat on the easy side (took me just about 5 hours to beat) but if you are a fan of horror movies like The Omen (which is the obvious inspiration here) I recommended it on a sale price.
1187	1	a	Despite the gameplay seeming too linear and samey, after picking it up discounted it's an enjoyable to kill time with..and people..
429	0	a	thought this game is an open-world game because of the video. I WAS WRONG!
1189	1	a	This games so creepy :v
430	0	a	This game really helped.
1191	1	a	This game is a great game its solo but fun!
1193	1	a	In this story there are no good endings unless you're the spawn of hell that survives and misdirects the blame for everything like a strategic murderer such as Lucius.  I don't recommend this game for the weak-minded, or weak-spirited.     The Story~
1195	1	a	This Game is very creepy and fun to play! You feel like you are the star villian in a b rated horror flick. Must buy for horror movie fans. Game play reminds me of some tittles I played in 90's , where you were always trying to figure out what items went with what and once you found them where to use them. I plan on buying 2nd one hope its is as good as this one.
1197	1	a	This game centres around the mis-adventures of a sweet 6 year old boy whos life gets turned upside down.  Fun game. quite glitchy but for the price i enjoyed it. Looking forward to the sequal.
1199	1	a	You can still play this if you belive in god  LOL
1201	1	a	Fun game. It's nice to be the creepy little kid and not running from him for a change.
1203	1	a	Great game but is very difficult... at least for me.
1205	1	a	One of a few games where you don't play as good character, but as bad character. Riddles are sometimes quite hard, but with using the thing, that most of us wearing on our necks, the riddles can be solved without bigger complications. Dante Manor is a big residence that's worth of exploring. Warning: Innocent people die in this game :-)  Verdict: 9/10
1207	1	a	Scariest part of this game is finding a stray lego block in the non-plastics section of my toybox.
1209	1	a	Best game ever 10/10.  And this was the most usefull review in the history of reviews.
1211	1	a	Wow what can i say?  One of the best single-player games i ever played before..  Amazing soundtracks and the graphics are just amazing..  U play as a 6 y old little antichrist boy..  Is fun as hell i completed the game in 6 h do so its kinda short :( I would say 666/666
1213	1	a	If you hail Satan I would recommend this game
1215	1	a	Was not prepared for lewd scenes.  10/10
1217	1	a	10/10 would sacrifice to Satan again.
1219	1	a	6/10  At first couple hours, I thought this game is quite boring because how the game machanic it is. It doesn't give you freely how you gonna kill. It locks how you kill, which is only one approach. You just need the right tool which can be found on the right place. and using that tool for the right object. Given that you are at a large maze mansion with multiple rooms. You have to run around and get lost very often. I feel frustrate on running around, and many occasions I have no clue what I have to do. (and then finally looking through walkthrough for that particular stuck)   I still have to no idea why you can collect the item which you can't use right now for the chapter. And then in the later chapter., you don't have go to pick the items because you have collected them already from previously chapter. I think it ruins the game machanic. (for example, in some of chapter, you have to sneak at night, and avoid to get detection in order to collect a necessary item, but.... if you have picked the item on previously chapters, then you no longer need to go.)  The game then become more interested when playing further. I mean when you get used to the game, basicly you have to do something around the target. and use some hint on your notebook to clue you what you are supposed to do. (By the way, you still get confuse what you have to do most of the time)  The story can keep me continue playing, including satisfying dead scene for every end of chapter. However, after finish the game, this game has low replayable because you've known all what you have to do, where you have to go, which spot in the room you have to use your skill on. Furthermore, the extra contents is not good to play with. It's just not polish.    Good: -The dead scene for every end of chapter can satisfy me. -Story driven is good. (I get addict on the first playthough because of this) -The game can push me too keep looking for the sequence... (but from the Lucius2 review... I don't know if I should try Lucius2 or not.)  Bad: -Too frustrate finding the right item on the right place and use it on the right object. -Mansion is too large and quite like a maze. It take you to survey around a very long time until you familiarize with. -linearity with killing method for each chapter.  btw, still recommend this game when it sale. (yep, I got this game on sale for 1 usd)
1221	1	a	Like hitman,but with kids
1223	1	a	It's like The Omen inside of a video game...Need I say more?
1225	1	a	Overall, I enjoyed Lucius and the funny moments that arose when I played it. I thoroughly enjoyed the cutscenes that roll after each kill. It did glitch (cutscene wouldn't activate) for me in the last chapter, but other then that my gameplay experience was smooth sailing. If you're not a fan of games with linear and restricting gameplay then this isn't the game for you. Most of your time is spent looking for items to kill your target with. Also, unlike Hitman which i've seen this game compared to there is only one way to kill each target. The puzzles for the most part are pretty straight forward, and not much of a challenge. After the first couple of kills it gets a little repetitive. Nonetheless, I enjoyed my time in the world of Lucius, and do not regret my purchase. If this game is on sale I would highly recommend picking it up.
1227	1	a	So what is this game about; you are playing as the son of devil 'Lucius' and in every chapter you have to kill one person in a specific way. There are 18 or 19 chapters. I liked the cutscenes also, everytime you kill someone there is a cutscene. I had a few glitches and at the beginning i wasted like hour because i couldnt see my mouse on the screen. I couldnt play this game full screen, so i had to window it. Sometimes i had to restart the game because it glitched on some parts. I got stuck to walls and objects if i was near them, but it only happened like 2 or 3 times. I am fan of horror and adventure games, so i love it. I like the surroundings, i like the mansion, i like the characters of the game and i love the soundtrack also. Even tho i had few glitches and problems, i gave this a recommend because i think people who like horror or adventure games may like this game also, as i did. &lt;:
1229	1	a	(Spoiler Alerts) Ok so the game is fun but there are some huge freaking problems. My main one being: THAT CHAPTER 05B IS BROKEN! There you are, awake at night to get rat poison, and on your way to get it, your mom wakes up and you have to hide. Thats reasonable right? Except that once you go out of hiding when she walks downstairs, you can still somehow get spotted by her through the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ FLOOR! Then once you get past that, you probably won't be beating that chapter, because you ave to break a light to distract a detective. You can break it and he walks into the darkness to see if someones there, so you should be able to enter the room, right? Nope, because the detective will turn and see you as soon as you make it within 2 feet of the door and SPOT YOU INSTANTLY!!! FIX THIS ♥♥♥♥!!! Other than that though, from what I've payed so far cuz I still can't beat chapter 05b, its fun and I reccomend it.
1231	1	a	This is a short, demented puzzle game where you play as the son of the devil as he goes about his father's requests to kill off everyone he knows. Surprisingly challenging puzzles can be find here. Clever levels in general, lots of achievements, and a decent sized map to explore. Definitely pick it up on sale!
1233	1	a	Love this game. It has a few tricky moments and the occasional tough puzzle, but any game like this should in my opinion.  I'm excited to play the second one!
1235	1	a	I saw to people doing it.
1237	1	a	I liked this game.
440	0	a	-saw mom trying to walk thru a closed door -got stuck on the floor like if i was swimming in it -sneaked past mom while making all the noises in the world -got stuck in a level because the detective decided to see me because I was 1cm left to the spot i should be (what?) -had to take the garbage out but lost it in the middle of the living room, during day time, because the room was too dark (even tho if you look from outside, it's quite bright inside). -killed someone instantly with rat poison, even tho that stuff takes it's time to actually kill someone (right?)  i don't even know anymore
1239	1	a	To Be honest i got this in the sale for a couple of Pounds, i have only just played it because i thought it looked a bit old and boring. i was not wrong, without the the help of youtube walkthroughs on some of the tasks, this game would be near impossible and my god that house is impossible to find your way around. spent a long time wandering around looking for one room and ending up in the place i started, only to get lost again. but after i got the idea and figured out the complicated ways you have to do everything it wasn't so bad and it has a good concept, i will be getting the 2nd one just to see how they have improved it and to be honest i can't wait!
441	0	a	Awesome concept but objectives are very vauge
1241	1	a	The lag in this game needs to be fixed
1243	1	a	Abnormal game... so dizzy during playing. However it is a good game with logical mission.
1245	1	a	An interesting game concept but it gets frustrating and tiresome at times. It's definitely something I would recommend, but only on sale.
1247	1	a	now im i want to ♥♥♥♥ susan THX :D
442	0	a	I bought this game at a store Harvey Norman and I have to run it through Steam..I paid good money for it and am unable to play it..it wont even launch..what a waste of money
443	0	a	I beat this game only because I felt I had to. There is no freedom in this game or strategy/skill. It's literally point A to B. There no creative aspect of it; there's only one way to kill a person, and it could take you a lot of time just to figure out how to do it. I give it 8%/100%  Do not buy.
444	0	a	I maybe should blame myself for how much of a let down this game was. I purchased it under the assumption that it would be a haunt and kill reminiscent of Sega genesis game that I played as a youth (The name escapes me as I write this review). Lucius is not this type of game. Lucius functions like an old style adventure game, where when the specific criteria is met, the story can move forward. I feel bad because this game could have been a gem, it has about seventy percent of what it needs to be a good game, but thirty percent off is enough to make all the difference. Do not purchase this game under any assumptions of what it is, i'll explain it quickly, Someone visits the home, do exactly the right thing with the required items and that is all.   Simply put, rating 4/10
1249	1	a	Nice Horror Puzzle Game Love It
1251	1	a	I really like this game. I'm going to college to be a criminal/forensic psych major. So this is candy for me! :)
1253	1	a	Lucius, the son of Lucifer, I love this game, it is amazing, one of my favorite games. I recommend it to you. It's kinda difficult, it has some bugs, but it is still a good game. I recommend it to you.
1255	1	a	Lucius is more of a puzzle game then anything else. There's 18 chapters in the game and each chapter, your goal is to kill a specific person of the Dante Manor, with the exception that some chapters you kill multiple people. It took me about 7 hours to beat this game and I feel like it was worth the money I spent while it was on sale (I beleive $5). Some missions were pretty easy to figure out while others were mearly impossible because the game didn't give you any sense of direction. In some chapters, you only have to find a couple of things to complete the mission, while others, you have to do a list of things. One thing I kept on forgetting was while playing was combining items, (for those of you who haven't played, you get batteries and a flashlight, you select the batteries and then place them in the flashlight). The games does a lot of combining items to make them useful to you, so make sure you don't forget that! Anyways, the quality of the game was iffy. The details seemed pretty fair, but when it goes to cutscenes where people talk, you can tell they didn't pay much attention to making the mouth open when you hear words. The story line made sence to me, like, you will kill a specific person first and then a character that was related to the person you just killed will get depressed and that would be your next target. Overall, I'd give this game a 5/10. I'm only giving it 5 because the story was short and the game didn't really help me with completing chapters which made it frustrating to figure out.  I would only buy it on sale if possible. There is a Lucius 2 which I'll be playing soon.

446	0	a	I'd like to say it takes quite a bit for me to write a negative review and I'll be as fair as I can be in evaluating Lucius. Pros: + Interesting concept, especially if you enjoyed 'The Omen' movies + Good Scenery + Decently made creepy ♥♥♥ kid (with those black soulless eyes)  Cons:  - Short (it did take me 6 hours to finish the game, 70% of the achievements done, and I wasn't trying) - No character development for anyone, whatsoever - Meh voice-acting - Falls flat in the story department - who am I kidding? There is no story, just the average day-to-day life of a satanic six year old hell-bent on murdering everyone he meets. - The missions and gameplay are ridicuously linear, and by this I mean you can not advance a mission without completing a certain step and there are no alternative paths. You have to kill THIS person, exactly this way, no exceptions. There are no choices made or options left up to the player. - The gameplay was frankly a bit boring. I had to force myself to sit down and finish the game and feel no inclination to ever come back to this game, even uninstalling it after I finished.   All in all, if you're looking for intuitive, active gameplay with a rich story, this is NOT the game for you. If you're looking for more of a narrative game experience, this is probably more along your lines. I would not pay the regular $10 for this game - my friend bought it for me as a gift during a sale for a few dollars, and I'm not sure I would have paid that.
1257	1	a	Hi guys, may the satanism and blasphemy be with you!  While my introduction rises the best welcomes of the year, I've played and finished this game and this is my opinion. Step 1 - if you don't like puzzle game with classic satan cliche' it's better if you look elsewhere, but if you get this game under the helloween moon, a bit for fun, and a bit for curiosity, you will not regret.  The game focus on how to kill people of a house without be directly involved. This means no shotguns, no direct approach, no fireballs... (maybe). Anyway you have to inspect the house, find elements and merge them with the environment to produce consequences... people react to consequences and in that fault you may arise into the lucifer domain, killing without a trace.  A part the story that is enough funny and ironic, the game is serius and grab from pagan legend the history of possessed people. In any case you are the Evil there, so you don't have nothing to fear about. This make the story a horror story.. fo the others!  Well it's all funny? Yes... someway. I've noticed a couple of bugs (the most bad was at the last scene, so I had to reload the game to have the game complete... and this was disappointing) but in general the quest are interesting. You will have to use also superpowers during the game progression, with an insert of new mechanics to complete the job.   Boring is also the saving system. If you quit, some object and actions you have done will be erased. The checkpoint are of course the kills. Graphics is detailed but a bit plastic. Your character move and play without saying any word, while the people of the house always repeat the same things.  Well, if you are going to get a smooth and interesting halloween this is the game for you. Do not expect it will last a life.. just a couple of days to be finished.  Lord Hol Napult's experience: 7/10
1259	1	a	I really enjoyed this game, absolutely worth the money if you like these sort of games.
1261	1	a	I really liked the game. It's pretty cool and the graphics tho *-*
450	0	a	The music literally ruins this game. It would be better suited to a Home Alone movie than a game about murder. Voice acting is terrible.  Clunky mechanics.  Bought it for $1. Want my $1 back.
451	0	a	Bought this game on sale because it seemed interesting. I lost interest the moment the bugs kicked in. I've had framedrops on cutscenes, a bug which forced me to redo several chapters due to picking up an item too early and the game not recognizing it being picked up.  Overall this game isn't worth the 21.99 it's listed and it's definetly not worth most people's time.
1263	1	a	Clunky and poor story but, I still enjoyed the game all the way though.
1265	1	a	Watched Pewds play it.  I thought I was womanly enough to play it myself.  I. Can't. Play. This. Without. Someone. Besides me.  Overall a great story-based killing game. Role reversal is always fun. Instead of being the Hero, you're the bloody murderer. A 6 year-old professional killer.
1267	1	a	If, and only if, you're sick and twisted, like i am, will you enjoy this game... The blood and gore in Lucius is brutal. Even for a gore fan like myself, I even cringed during a few death scenes, and it's so much more brutal because you play a 7 year old child. Lucius, is one of a kind, a child possessed by the devil himself. You then go on a journey of pure carnage, killing the entire household, in many twisted ways. Great game, sometimes it can be frustrating finding the answers to the clues, but its worth it to see the murderous scenes that unfold... The gameplay is nice, runs and looks great, not too long, but not too short either, and the achievements flow in as the game goes on. Noticed today that the game went on sale, with a 95% discount, which is insanely good value for the quality of the game you get. I'm looking forward to completing my remaining achievements, and heading on to Lucius 2. 8/10
452	0	a	Plain tedious.
1269	1	a	great game //
1271	1	a	How to be the antichrist. I had fun killing those meat bags. lol
453	0	a	Recomend or not. It is hard to decide with this game.  The graphics arn't that good, but for the price I have seen worse. It is a very linear game with not that many options of what to do or not. The majority of the achievements are easy and fun to get if you ignore the 20 hour and 40 hour achievement. The game is much to short to get them without wasting electricity of the pc keeping the game active while you find something more interesting to do.   The ways you have to kill people is midly creative and fun to find out, but that is pretty much where the fun ends.
454	0	a	It's just boring, no creativity at all. Only one way to kill every person and after three kills I just got fed up of it.
1273	1	a	Its a great game.
455	0	a	I've played this game for only a short time, but I've found the experience to be long and drawn out. The system doesn't give you any way of assistance of navigating this confusing place, that is the Dante Manor. If you had a more defined area to explore and search in, the pace would have been much faster and would have made for a much more novel game. But as it stands, the game is fraught with small irrtations without relief. The only source to find a way forward with the quests is to access walk throughs online.
1275	1	a	Funny and worth the price.
1277	1	a	Game about waking up in your room after night talking with Satan.  8\10 would kill again..
1279	1	a	Great Family fun for all &gt;; )
1281	1	a	The idea of using an environment to kill people is pretty neat. It's reasonable story and decent objective, although some of them might be a bit too vague to figure out and then end up taking forever. But overall is good. The music is pumping and pleasure to my ears, which is one of the best thing about the game.
1283	1	a	That moment when u do the tour of the house,to find the victim ! 69/10
1285	1	a	Makes me become Satan. FeelsReallyGood.  Recommend for those who want to murder any of your family members ^-^.
1287	1	a	+ Plot and the characters were very interesting. I also liked this games black humor and soundtrack (dark and mysterious).  AND tricycling round the mansion. yess  - Damn buggies I recommend this game if you want to play as the son of the devil.
1289	1	a	demon child. 10/10
1291	1	a	Lucius us a good game. It's a great stress reliever, the deaths were pretty amusing (morbidly amusing), and it had enough content that you could take a while to beat the game. There were bugs that made levels impossible to finish and forced you to restart the entire chapter (Chapter 13 specifically, using telekinesis on a certain item could cause it to fall in a place where you couldn't get it again. I had to restart it five times), and sometimes it was overly difficult for no reason (Chapter 10 specifically, sneaking through the mansion if you don't get the glue before you start the mission is god awful), but overall, I really enjoyed the game.
1293	1	a	lucius, the most evil kid on the planet earth
1295	1	a	Lucius is a point and click story that takes place at the sprawling mass that is Dante Manor. Reminiscent of everyone's favourite little demon seed, Omen, you've got a lot of work to do for your infernal majesty. Dante Manor is a large place, especially for a young lad like Lucius. With a plethora of corridors and rooms, it can sometimes be confusing (it was for me, for many chapters until I learned it like the back of my hand) to get around. Thus, becoming lost within its many chambers and lobbies.  Your objective; reap souls for your true father. Sounds easy enough, right? Each specific kill requires you to carry out specific actions with certain items and sequences which can sometimes leave you scratching your head as you go delving into every room within the Manor looking for the one thing you need. Despite this, every kill is well thought out and creative, making your toiling worth the while when you see your victims eviscerated.  The atmosphere within Dante Manor is somewhat of a two-faced creature. On one hand, during the day, you have the grandeur of the estate. Accentuated by its gothic trimmings in the form of the sound track and formality. It seems calm - as if all is well. Contrast that to the way it carries itself at night. The despair drenched piano pieces, bleak ambience and the all too pervasive echoing of footsteps and doors being used really inflames the urgency to remain undetected or even be swallowed up by the Manor itself.  The only thing I can really discredit Lucius for is its few glitches that will require you to do no more than restart a chapter, I.E. being swallowed up by the Manor's walls or an NPC misbehaving. Overall, a great game that'll have you scratching your head on occasion and will even have you laughing if you have a taste for the macabre, accompanied by a fitting soundtrack. I'd definitely kill again.
1297	1	a	A little bit buggy and laggy, but I don't have a great PC. On the lower settings it helps this. Overall one of the more fun games I've played. Fun, great story, good mechanics. Awesome game overall.
1299	1	a	If you ever dream to be that demon lovechild no one ever wanted and a bunch of fanbases scattering around to praise your mighty-ness whatevs, at least Mr. Lucifer is your father.   but mom hates you dad hates you your servants hates you grandpa hates you police hates you.  10/10 recomend. 
1301	1	a	DO NOT miss a chance to pick up this game for the discounted steam price! I repeat! I mean cmon you play the son of Lucifer. the stealth mechanics are one of a kind and spot on, the story line is wonderful, there is loads of sublte, dark humour throughout the entire game. this game was very well planned out and put together! please play the first before you play the second. did i mention you play the son of lucifer. puzzle meets stealth, gorefest, with thrills and chills. its a must own. no real glitchs either. runs smooth and offers hours of fun.  8/10
1303	1	a	This is a splendid game! Great graphics and story line! I would totally recommend it! Only negatives about this game is if you're super religious it might offend you and the plot and gameplay can become extremely slow and hard to navigate. Overall a great game for the little demon in you :)
1305	1	a	I watched Pewdiepie played this game before so i had interest in buying it. At first i was like hmm should i buy the game or not... But i was like meh.. F*ck it! It took me 6.5 hrs to finish the game.  #PlayedWithWalkthroughs #noob   Pros: -Has a great story -You can unlock cool stuff like a bike if you're a good boy! (if you do some chores) -You get to see some ;) (you'll see) -Decent graphics  -Decent voice acting -SATISFYING KILLS AND SH*T!  Cons: -Some characters in the cutscenes have late reactions (LOL) -There are some bugs but its minor. -Few powers sadly :( -The game's kinda short tho -YOU DEFINITELY NEED GUIDES AND WALKTHROUGHS TO FINISH THIS -Can be boring at times if you don't know what to do...  10/10 would Recommend this Unholy game :P  Give me a +rep in my profile if you found this review helpful :)   Thanks!
459	0	a	The gameplay isn't bad, but it takes far too long to figure out what your objective is and where the things you need to achieve it are.There is almost no explanation of what to do it or how to do it.So this is what it's like to control a whale. Last scenes are stupid and the ending is just horrible. Bad voice acting and limited gameplay most likely contributed to it.  So much wasted potential.... 5/10    
1307	1	a	Lucius has an intriguing premise, but some not-so-original adventure-game flaws.
1309	1	a	+ Plot and the characters were very interesting. I also liked this games black humor and soundtrack (dark and mysterious).  AND tricycling round the mansion. yess  - Damn buggies I recommend this game if you want to play as the son of the devil.
461	0	a	In my opinion the game was ok at first some bugs, and glitches here and there, then came the midnight missions you only have to do two. Now the first one was easy but the other i was hiding behind a door and someone saw me. Tried to use memory wipe but it was useless. Overall the game is ok but i just do not like it.
1311	1	a	this is game is fun, a little bit creepy and pervert... lol
1313	1	a	If you want a game about murdering your family then this game is for you. Its a unique game I suppose although it is very rough. The narrative is good but its not great because you can't turn of subtitles and the voice actors are not that great. The murders are good but sometimes they don't always make sense. Sometimes their straightforward and you have no problems. Other times you can't figure them out and your forced to use a walkthrough. A shame the sequel to this game didn't turn out. This game could really use a re do to make better graphics and more lines of dialogue with better voice actors. Still, its good for 5 hours of fun.
462	0	a	Bought this game on sale because it seemed interesting. I lost interest the moment the bugs kicked in. I've had framedrops on cutscenes, a bug which forced me to redo several chapters due to picking up an item too early and the game not recognizing it being picked up.  Overall this game isn't worth the 21.99 it's listed and it's definetly not worth most people's time.
1315	1	a	Every were that Lucius walks death follows of corse when people start to be murdered no one points to a child. This charming young evil child has captivated my soul hes almost to cute to say no to. his handsome father (the devil) almost makes me want to sell my soul to him. though i dout the devil has ever look so handsome in a game correct me if im wrong. Lucius will make your sick little devil love heart come out this game almost feels like it was made for me. The sick and twisted way that Lucius thinks is almost to much to for my girl hood.   This boy pulls off murders better than most real life adults. This boy is what nightmares are made of.  though i only have nice things to say. i spoiled the game for my self by watching someone play this and the seconed one but there so good &lt;3  
1317	1	a	its a good game a really good game but its not for me.
1319	1	a	It was rather fun a murder puzzle when you do the kiling. Simple but entertaining
1321	1	a	10/10 would recommend this game. Within the first ten minutes I killed a woman by locking her in a freezer and my mom made me clean my room. 100% worth it.
465	0	a	The concept is brilliant! Sadly the pace of the gameplay is too erratic to hold my interest.   Long periods of point-and-click style play happen between tasks/murders which vary in difficulty, seemingly at random. Generally in games keystage challenges become exponentially more difficult, but in my (short) exploration of this one it seems one task can be virtually impossible to complete followed by a task which is ludicrously simple.   It is challenging, in some instances overly so; actions expected of the player can be very obscure with no hints, once you've finally figured out what you have to do it can then be a feat of superhuman dexterity to complete your mission... creaing a serious anticlimax. It is frustrating and slightly tedious in alternating intervals. This is not helped by the fact the game mechanics appear to struggle with a controller, there are a great many graphics glitches, odd bouts of lag, and reloading from a checkpoint takes a very long time.   Perhaps the game is just older and I am being unfair. It is also possible that I'm just not suited to this type of puzzle solving as, to be candid, this game very quickly felt like a chore rather than a joy which is a pity because, as I said, the concept is awesome.
1323	1	a	this game make my laptop working so hard ,i hope this thing not gonna blowup -_- ,but i like this game and game play is really cool,hope you add Graphic Setting on option ,
1325	1	a	Meh... meh lmehm mlehm. I guess some people will enjoy it. I did to begin with, and currently having a really hard time figuring out if I'm sad I spent money on it or not.
1327	1	a	When I bought this game I thought it'd be a quick little indy game that only lasted an hour or so. In reality it's pretty long for the price, and really fun. I got this and part two for 6 bucks in a steam sale, though i'd have been happy had i paid 20. Nice graphics if you care about that sort of thing, and well put together. So far I haven't had any problems with glitches and such either. I like this game a lot and it's pretty creative when it comes to how you kill your targets. It's dark, sinister, and you really feel like a creepy little devil child. It almost feels similar to a less complex hitman game, though instead of an assassin you're a devil child with a few satanic powers.
467	0	a	no this game runs like ♥♥♥♥
1329	1	a	'Yeah, accidents happen all the time. What makes you think it was MURDER?'
1331	1	a	I liked the game:  Good: A really different game than what I am used to. Dark story, with creative ways of gaming. Bit forced (linear), especially locked doors that shouldn't be locked. Murdering people in different way is fun anyway!  Mum stalks me! (is that good xD?).  Bad: I don't know how to explain this without spoiling, but some things you are supposed to do at some point, aren't really that easy. Playing this for 40 hours achievement? NOPE! 20 hours? I don't think so.
1333	1	a	A sadistic little piece of ♥♥♥♥ kills everyone in the house including priests?! Love it. 5/7.
1335	1	a	Wow... This is a hardcore scary number one indie game!!
1337	1	a	Too scared to play this by myself  10/10
471	0	a	I looked at this game for a long time when it finally got on sale. So I went and bought it. My little brother warned me against getting this game. He said it was bad. I ignored him. I owe him an apology. He told me the controls were hard to work with and the plot was stupid. Lo and behold, the controls were hard to work with. Not at all helped by how the framerate likes to bounce up and down like a hyperactive child in a bouncy castle going through a sugar high. As for the plot and story , I don't know what to telI you on that front because I was too busy having a wrestling match with the controls to find out what the story was.  I was so unsatisfied I requested a refund, which I normally never do to a game that is on sale. I am really disappointed in this game and myself for buying it.  Just go watch one of those 'demonic child movies' I heard about. I'm sure you'll get the same experience.
1339	1	a	Pretty good game to kill time with. Decent graphics, many possibilities. It has it bugs/glitches but in the end is really entertaining. Strong 7/10 for me.
1341	1	a	So much death, t'is good
1343	1	a	Darkness, evil and fun make this game a fantastic play. I love the aspect of being the evil protagonist along with kill everyone without getting caught. Highly recommended play, I only wish there were more games like this out there.
1345	1	a	Game is awesome ! I love it ,graphics are grate,story I'd say is interesting and I like to be a paranormal kid in game so yeh game is worth it ;)
1347	1	a	+ Plot and the characters were very interesting. I also liked this games black humor and soundtrack (dark and mysterious).  AND tricycling round the mansion. yess  - Damn buggies I recommend this game if you want to play as the son of the devil.
1349	1	a	Remember in Oblivion (Elder Scrolls Series) when you're in the dark brotherhood and you get to kill the house guests? This is a roided up version of that very short quest. But you can't be too blunt or obvious about your kills, no crouching with a sword this time, instead you've got to watch them, learn what they do... and proceed through your plan to ultimately sacrifice them to your 'father'.  Its a great game and I recommend everyone try it at least once.
1351	1	a	That moment when u do the tour of the house,to find the victim ! 69/10
1353	1	a	The game concept and story line are certainly refreshing. This game would be great if the control werent so clunky. This game also have the usual annoying cursor accelerator. Lucius shoud BURN whoever created the ACCELERATOR!! so annoying
473	0	a	Nope.
1355	1	a	♥♥♥♥ing Satan simulator  10/10 Would see Tom having sex again
1357	1	a	not the best voice acting, some bugs here and there but for an indie developed game the graphics are quite well done. This is a morbid puzzle game and fun one at that. It's fun to get a game where you are the bad guy and its nice to have one where you actually need to put thought into it. 9/10 good fun if your into adventure puzzle games, just a little buggy sometimes.
1359	1	a	While I was initially disappointed that Lucius wasn't a a free-for-all murder-athon something akin to Naughty Bear, I did grow to enjoy the game when I finally reconciled that it was completely scripted. You play as Lucius, supposed son of a very wealthy politician, when you find out on your sixth birthday that you're actually the son of satan. Your real father then tasks you with killing as many people as can, for with each soul you sacrifice, your powers will grow.  Each murder is its own chapter and puzzle with varying difficulty. Your map will always lead you to the person you're supposed to kill, and from there you must figure out the method needed. You journal, as well as the dialogue from other people within your household, will give you hints on how each person is to be dispatched.  The murder scenes can be quite graphic, and there is some nudity, but if neither of these bother you, go ahead and buy the game at full price, the game is worth it.
1361	1	a	I love watching peopleplaying the game. I don't like to play it myself. I love killing people, this game is funny and brings up good jokes on the way. But, since the game is old, I find the controlring system kinda annoying and buggy sometimes... Still recommending this game for people who want to record for youtube or play with friends!
1363	1	a	Lucius has an intriguing premise, but some not-so-original adventure-game flaws.
1365	1	a	The game is pretty cool, I really like the storyline. The puzzles can really make you think.
1367	1	a	I saw someone having sex, and I imidiately went to my favorite porn site...       woot m8! I BET U WOULD HAVE DONE THE SAME! &gt;:(
1369	1	a	I Really Enjoyed This Game, I Completed It With All Achievements (Easy). The Ways You Kill The Manor Residents Was Fun &amp; Hilarious At Times.
1371	1	a	although i like this game a lot, the game crashes after chapter 5 and i cant play chapter 6, even so the game with that offer is one of the best choises you can make, its 1,49$, if you lost the chance then for 9,99$ the game isnt worth it, cause it has some bugs, it should propably be around 5$ to worth the money, if it was without bugs then 10$ is no problem.
1373	1	a	Who would of thought being the son of Satan would be so fun?
1375	1	a	Great story instensive game
1377	1	a	Lucius haeve a nice story .  I invite you to play . Hope you enjoy
1379	1	a	It's a fun game and the premise is interesting, I only wish there was more freedom to do what you want.
1381	1	a	If you don't have super high expectations for video games, &amp; really like creepy/ macabre stuff, this game is right up your alley. I also appreciated playing the roll of the bad guy for once, &amp; to have all the answers that everyone else is trying to figure out.  The story is engaging, albeit pretty cheesy &amp; predictable, but I got more of a feeling of old-flim nostalgia than annoyed at it. I'd give the story overall a 8/10.  The controls were pretty good on a XBox 360 controller, &amp; I was able to run the game passably on a toaster of a laptop.
1383	1	a	Yes a game where you can kill innocent people as a devil child XD
1385	1	a	atmospheric game
1387	1	a	You play as the six year old son of the devil (like in The Omen). The goal is really simple: In each chapter, you have to kill someone in a SPECIFIC way. You have to find some items, put them (or interact with them) at specific places to achieve your goal. For me, it's not a problem. As long as you're okay with that, you'll enjoy it as much as I did!  Cutest little devil. &lt;3
1389	1	a	Quite an entertaining game. Would certainly recommend if found in a bundle or on sale. Puzzles and gameplay are fairly simplistic, but the entertainment for me came from the darkness of it. You are running around as an evil child...   A small guide or couple of play throughs with plenty of exploration is what is required. A full play through doesn't take many hours.
1391	1	a	Fun. Some cults and stuff.
1393	1	a	Sick game
1395	1	a	  I'm always scared yet I'm the one causing terror (ू˃̣̣̣̣̣̣o˂̣̣̣̣̣̣ ू)³₌₃
1397	1	a	Loveable, cuddly, with just a bit of evil.
1399	1	a	Quite fun. A little irritating on occasion, but all in all, worth every penny. I suggest you give it a go.
1401	1	a	IM SO EVIL.
1403	1	a	Your a little rich kid ♥♥♥♥
1405	1	a	The Power of Christ Compels You! - To buy this game.. like now. No seriously its fun!
1407	1	a	Rly nice game
1409	1	a	Rating: 8/10  This game was actually pretty fun (in twisted meaning), with nice graphics and creepy soundtrack. The whole story is situated in one huge manor, and there are many cutscenes before and after 'murder', so besides enjoying great 'puzzle-solving' game-play, you also have a feeling like watching a movie, pretty sick movie about demonic child. Every death is unique and requires time to figure out how to manage it (some are quite tough).
1411	1	a	yo guys i think you should get this game it is gory but funny has a good story hope u like it
1413	1	a	The Omen: The Video Game. Wait wait wait.... copyright preventing them using The Omen. Damn close enough. Ever wanna know how the kid got around killing everyone. Lucius will show you... Minus the b-rate voice acting and script this was an amazing game. Too bad it's trailer spoiled a few of the awesome deaths. 7/10
1415	1	a	Super fun especially if you enjoy causing people pain and most of the time...-&gt; (death) ^-^
1417	1	a	other images glitching onto the screen repeatedly while trying to play and while in the menu
1419	1	a	I'm not far into this so far, but it's loads of fun. If the idea of playing The Omen in the style of the Hitman games sounds like fun then this is very much for you :)  So many smiles pass my face :)
1421	1	a	This game killed my video card. 11/10 HELP ME PADRE FOR I HAVE SINNED.
1423	1	a	Lucius was a pretty interesting game. The concept was pretty unique, although it would have been nice to be more creative with each kill. Replay is kind of dead since once you've played through it once, that's pretty much it. Nothing really is added for replay value.
1425	1	a	WAS OKAY not really a fun end 
1427	1	a	I just spent the last 6 hours playing through this insane game - and I loved every minute of it!   As the classic narrative goes (closest resemblance here is Rosemary's Baby), Satan is invoked to claim a child as his offspring - that would be our protagonist Lucius. He then continues to teach the boy in the sick ways of doing his bidding - the player takes over this role then. There is a total of 18 chapters and each contains a mission to creatively murder one or several people in a way that pleases his Dark Lordship, all while avoiding any suspicion and planting false clues and evidence.   Technically this game is well done. The graphics will certainly not win any prices, especially the textures of the surroundings, but on the other hand, the effects look good and the characters show a variety of body language, facial expressions and are lip-synced. The gamneplay/controls and what little menu (inventory) you need are smooth and fine as they are. I especially liked the audio: a variety of atmospheric music (and the annoying music on the tape that you will sooner or later hand to the driver - which is meant to be that way :D ) and good voice actors.  Overall, this game is unique: it's sadistic, dark and twisted, sometimes even humorous (depends on your kind of humor of course ;) ). The kill sequences, that crown your triumph at the end of each chapter, are a bizarre and wonderfully gruesome mix of sensation and childlike wonder - in the way children sometimes enjoy litting ants on fire and the like. An always fascinating and gripping ride from start to finish. 85% in my book.
1429	1	a	I really like this game a lot. Even if it is repeatitive as other says, i liked it. I found this game fun to play. I reccomend this game to people who don't have such high standards on games just here to enjoy a game.
1431	1	a	Best horror classic game as i say! personally i feel like this game have been made special for me , i feel so haPpy and satisfied playing this crazy game , just killing ppl left and right ! feels So epic .. i always loved magic powers as well as so here you go all what you want exist in one fkin game called lucius its also clearly based on the movie called THe Omen ... !!
1433	1	a	Great game, I loved everyminuet of it.
1435	1	a	Whats not to like about playing the bad guy? This little gem of a game is devilishly fun and brutal. For a game made in 2012, the graphics are really good, in my opinion, and the game is very well polished. Some of the kills are really nasty to watch, for example the Butcher. If you are Christian or do not like things with references to the Devil and Satanic symbols, DONT PLAY THIS GAME, but if you dont really care, give it a whirl!
1437	1	a	great game creepy as ♥♥♥♥
1439	1	a	On 6/6/66, in ward 666, a boy named Lucius is born. Six years later, Dante Manor, his home, is shaken by a series of gruesome murders. No-one knows what to think. Has the house been cursed? Take control of Lucius - akin to the Antichrist - and his satanic powers to wreak havoc. This game is not for the faint hearted, there are a lot of gory scenes and a few sexual ones. Villain protagonists are always fun, and this game is no exception. There are some truly messed-up deaths here. This game contains aspects of stealth and puzzle, as you try to figure out how to pull off your next demonic act, without arousing the suspicions of anyone else. The one major letdown is the considerable lack of information. You have very little idea what to do, and this can prove rather difficult in such a big house with so many tiny details. I also experience a few bugs and occasional crashes, but it does not impact gameplay too much. Apart from that, the gameplay experience is rather pleasing. I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys the supernatural, stealth, puzzles, or just plain murder. Enter if you dare...
1441	1	a	I saw someone having sex, and I imidiately went to my favorite porn site...       woot m8! I BET U WOULD HAVE DONE THE SAME! &gt;:(
479	0	a	Bought this game and it's broken, I can't even get through the intro because the items won't cycle, my mouse wheel works fine, and about half the time when I bring up my notepad, nothing. not that it maters because I can't progress any further.
1443	1	a	'How to kill your family' simulator.
1445	1	a	A little bit buggy and laggy, but I don't have a great PC. On the lower settings it helps this. Overall one of the more fun games I've played. Fun, great story, good mechanics. Awesome game overall.
1447	1	a	is a fun game to play
1449	1	a	Pros  Fun game Good youtube content Fun kills BYCICLES CONS Linear story not very creative gets a bit repetive  0 replayablity
1451	1	a	Despite the bizarre 500 ms delay every time it has to load a .wav for someone to talk and similar technical glitches, I enjoyed this because it's completely different fare than the usual.   It's fun to run around as a demonic kid planning tricky ways to kill people. I barely needed to use a walk-through, not sure what this says about me personally.  I ran it at 4k and ultra high, was very playable. Bit rough and unpolished in places but still worth picking up at an extreme discount.
1453	1	a	I really liked playing through this game. It is weird. It is a good 'puzzle' game. However the game does bug out a lot on chapter 13 and is probably one of the downsides of this game. If they made patch for this game I would have enjoyed it more but unfortunately there is no patch yet. It can get boring because you are only able to go around the mansion and a small garden  My Rating: 8/10
1455	1	a	bought it just for intrest but man did it mess me up mentally but im not gunna let my taste make a bad review if you like the evil puzzle games then this game is for you just becareful when you play at night i had to delete this game cause of how bad i felt lmao 'its just a game does no justice...
1457	1	a	6/10  At first couple hours, I thought this game is quite boring because how the game machanic it is. It doesn't give you freely how you gonna kill. It locks how you kill, which is only one approach. You just need the right tool which can be found on the right place. and using that tool for the right object. Given that you are at a large maze mansion with multiple rooms. You have to run around and get lost very often. I feel frustrate on running around, and many occasions I have no clue what I have to do. (and then finally looking through walkthrough for that particular stuck)   I still have to no idea why you can collect the item which you can't use right now for the chapter. And then in the later chapter., you don't have go to pick the items because you have collected them already from previously chapter. I think it ruins the game machanic. (for example, in some of chapter, you have to sneak at night, and avoid to get detection in order to collect a necessary item, but.... if you have picked the item on previously chapters, then you no longer need to go.)  The game then become more interested when playing further. I mean when you get used to the game, basicly you have to do something around the target. and use some hint on your notebook to clue you what you are supposed to do. (By the way, you still get confuse what you have to do most of the time)  The story can keep me continue playing, including satisfying dead scene for every end of chapter. However, after finish the game, this game has low replayable because you've known all what you have to do, where you have to go, which spot in the room you have to use your skill on. Furthermore, the extra contents is not good to play with. It's just not polish.    Good: -The dead scene for every end of chapter can satisfy me. -Story driven is good. (I get addict on the first playthough because of this) -The game can push me too keep looking for the sequence... (but from the Lucius2 review... I don't know if I should try Lucius2 or not.)  Bad: -Too frustrate finding the right item on the right place and use it on the right object. -Mansion is too large and quite like a maze. It take you to survey around a very long time until you familiarize with. -linearity with killing method for each chapter.  btw, still recommend this game when it sale. (yep, I got this game on sale for 1 usd)
483	0	a	good idea, poorly executed. often difficult to navigate. buggy when it comes to retention of items, progress, events, etc. poor writing and mostly poor voice acting. ending is sudden and unsatisfying, partially due to poor pacing. that said, there are definitely some cool moments scattered throughout. on occasion, the mood and environment line up just right and one has to give credit for the creativity of some of the kills. unfortunately, the puzzles are usually overly simplistic or counterintuitive and the dark atmosphere and gory spectacles seem forced at times. i could mention several specific gripes, but the first example that comes to mind is    when lucius gains the power to control fire. lucifer specifically says 'now, you don't need matches!' immediately after this, the player must light candles with matches to advance.    when combat, precision, speed, stealth, etc. are involved, the game falls short and irrevocably spoils the decent bits. cool at first glance but overall a sophomoric effort. the best part was picking up    pornographic videos and trying to show my prized copy of '♥♥♥♥♥ hunters' to my parents and housemates.   
484	0	a	I didn't find the game to be that interesting or intuitive. There's no motivation from the main character to bring about the horrific deaths of other people in the house except 'Satan appeared in my room one night and told me that if I murder people I get more psychic, I am totally okay with this.' Like, okay, sure. I'll fumble around with no hints and kill people I have no/minor grudges against, sounds great.
485	0	a	First blood was pointless and not rewarding. Next scene was like, 'WTF'.
1459	1	a	Can brake bottles of vine!  10/10 broken bottles of vine! :wasted:
486	0	a	Monotonous killings, and only a few ways to do so makes this game rather lackluster. After waking up and seeing old Satan himself telling a 10 year to go do the dirty deeds is entertaining in itself. Sadly after trying to sneak to kill someone It is dissapointing to be caught by your mom who scholds you and tells you to march right back to bed. If there were more customization options then the linear story and powers this might have done amazingly. 4 / 10
487	0	a	I find this game boring soo far soory but damn I am getting sleepy playing this. It has some sort of potential for fun game but I dunno not for me it's sketched to much, with plenty bugs which are making comedy of this. For few bucks you can try it. I will play it for few more hours, but my immersion got destroyed and story is not that engaging either.
488	0	a	Not very fun at all. 
1461	1	a	Okay I first heard of this game by watching a Youtube streamer play it and I can say I sat and watched him play the entire game and enjoyed the storyline, the game play and even the fact that the main character is not your usual protaganist. I really wanted to play it so I went straight onto an e shop to see how much it was, though unfairly I was unemployed at the time so I could not afford to buy it so imagine my surprise when today on Steam it was reduced and I had money to buy it at last. I played it straight away and although I am rubbish with keyboard controls I found it quickly enjoyable and amusing. The dark story despite having seen it all before was much better than any goody two shoes story of heroism I was used too simply because of the idea of the story despite there not being a great deal of story anyway. I really suggest this game to any gamer type.
1463	1	a	Reading other reviews there's a lot of condemnation for a linear point and click style strictly story line game. Makes a change really with all the open world games out there and 'lets see how many different ways you can come up with to kill people'. If you want open world, free choice on actions and outcomes then this game is definately not for you. It's basically a game version of The Omen type story. Without giving too much away, small boy, spawn of satan, kill you family and develop your powers. It's very imaginative in how there is little guidance and you actually have to think on how the game wants you to do the murders without getting caught, with only a little guidance on where your next move takes you. All in all I believe it is a charming little game dedicated to one of the classics in the horror genre which puts you in the place of the demon child. If you like point and click type games, free roaming but with a very scripted storyline and an intelligent game you have to think about then I would definately recommend this game! :)
1465	1	a	Love this game~!!!!! Can't wait for Lucius II.
1467	1	a	 Lucius... aka Antichrist Simulator from Damien Thorn, in The Omen (1976) movie.   The game itself plays a lot like the Hitman series, minus the shooting aspect. Like the game name says, you play as Lucius, a 6 years old (midway in the game, you get 7!) who was fortunate enough to had been born in a satanic invocation. It doesn't take long to go around, learn the basics and then, get on with it on your murder list!  There isn't much to be said about this game, concerning the story and gameplay. It gets the job done and honestly, I can't understand the gaming industry bashing this game. I liked it mostly for all its numerous faults and cons and it was satisfying enough to keep me interested and playing till the end (game is about 6 hours long).  PROS: +Antichrist antihero (feels weird and cool at the same time! Be THE creepy kid with powers!). +Creepy, tensed and gory atmosphere during the murder scenes. +Game is challenging enough to keep you guess the next step although, you can always get a walkthrough guide to speed things up! +Lots of exploring to do in this huge mansion.  CONS: -Some gameplay mechanics weren't responsive fast enough, especially during that Chapter 10 stealth mission. Patrolling grownups could see me even well hidden through walls and doors. -Straightforward linear killing list. -At some chapters startup, the game lacks direction as to where to go, what to do as you roam around the big mansion aimlessly. Quite irritating! Better read a walkthrough as I sure did around Chapter 5. Also, the map could use refinement! -The chores side quests are really worthless and only time sink. I suggest you simply ignore them... well the ones that you can as some could be mandatory, like that tape cassette for Micheal. -Save-game mechanic is atrocious. No quick-save, no auto save midway in a mission. You are forced to start a chapter and finish it so you can be sure the game saves your progress there.   OVERALL: Faulty game but entertaining enough (to me though) to keep you playing until the showdown. Lucius felt exactly like 'The Omen' simulator and it was a decent entry for this franchise. I do expect the sequel to surpass this game especially on the visual aspect as it is very lackluster (yes, game looks quite ugly), the gameplay mechanics and game direction with a better pathing on a reliable map.  RECOMMENDATION: Loved The Omen movie and loves creepy adventure styles game? This game is for you! Just, wait for a decent deal before forking you dough in this game.  RATING: 666 / 666 ... 6.66 / 10
489	0	a	This game is not what I was expecting, and my standards weren't even that high..
490	0	a	Lucius is a puzzle game, where the puzzle to solve is murder.  The replayability is very low. The puzzles aren't always challenging, just frustratingly clueless. And often repetitive.  I finished it under 5 hours. The only reason I have so many hours on this game is for that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ achievement. 40 hours ? Really ? Nobody would ever play this game for that long without the achievement there ...
1469	1	a	I came, I saw, I was the kid from the Omen. Although the getting caught parts got rather annoying, the game itself was fun. It was linear, so I do look forward to part two.
1471	1	a	it's a fun game with killing so basically if cod and satan had a baby with only one gun usage, it would be LUCIUS :D and to be fair its a medium long game with fun thats gonna make it my favorite series so go on buy this game and lucius will murder the holy blood of his family
1473	1	a	This game is one of my favorites, now that I have played it, and completed it in about 9-10 hours. I got it when it was on sale before Lucius 2 came out, and I'm so glad it was on sale and I had found it. No regrets on buying it, but now that it's no longer on sale as of right now, anyone interested in getting the game at the normal price, don't question it, you won't regret it. Especially if you love to kill people for no real reason, creepy demonic stuff, and I do enjoy the most in this game, because some parts are a little confusing, trying to figure out exactly what to do [or how to kill the person] that it will put that person on a 'repeated' schedule in the game until you figure out what you need to do, so you don't need to rush or panic that you can't figure it out for a while. I highly recommend!
491	0	a	Lucius feels more like a point and click game with a third person interface than it does a stealth/horror game. The world is too big. There isn't much room for creativity. It seems you need to find the one item that will allow whatever the next death sequence is to take place. The voice acting is stilted. The writing is pretty generic. All in all, life is short and there are stronger games out there to play.
1475	1	a	Have you ever seen the movie Omen? No? Me neither, but I'm sure you're familiar with the trope of the eerie creepy son of Satan character arc that can be portrayed in some of Hollywood's most frightening films. Now, instead of playing the hero one would think they would be, you play as LUCIUS the hell spawn himself and roam about innocently your parents manor, using your new found powers to end the miserable lives of all who reside there.  The game itself has a wonderful concept, BECOME the horror, and while it may sometimes be delivered poorly due to some level breaking bug or the fact that you're spotted once and then you have to start ALL over again I still think it accomplishes what it sets out to do.  Now, this isn't a action game, sort of. There are parts that heavily rely on action, but the majority of the game is spent in the puzzle world. Think of it like Hitman and your run of the mill puzzle game clash heads. Safe to say, I definitely enjoyed the puzzles (IE Murders) a lot more, action was too clunky and felt like it was tacked on.  Anyways 7/10 Would try again.
1477	1	a	I thought this game was rad, it lived up to my expectations 100%. This game has an awesome cinematic feel, and the visuals are pretty damn good. The voice acting is lackluster at most points, but there's occasionally a shred of real emotion and that's pretty nice.  The puzzles are pretty neat too, there's a lot of forshadowing (whether on purpose or not) due to being able to see what you can use your abilities on, so it's pretty satisfying to finally use something you've had in your inventory for a while, Although it can be a pretty big boner to realize you need to go find an item you should have already come across. A couple of the puzzles seemed pretty obtuse and confusing, but I get that way with most games like this so that might be just me THANKFULLY the game offers a pretty basic hint thingy which is optional so you don't have to deal with spoiled answers!   The only reaaaaaal downsides I have to say are that there are definitely some glitches. I've been launched through the stairs quite a few times and while it's hilarious it's also inconvenient, but I don't remember having any gamebreaking bugs or anything. Also for being sort of presented as a sandbox, the game is linear as hell and there's no room for variation which kinda sucks but it's still fun figuring out all the prebuilt sequences. Thankfully I hear the sequel is truly openended and has traps and such so heyyyyyyyyyyyyy  I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THE SEQUEL BECAUSE THIS GAME IS GOOD AND I WANT MORE
1479	1	a	you need to kill a guy by tinkering with gas cooker, the gas is in the whole freaking kitchen but the guy doesnt give a ♥♥♥♥ and still lits up the cigaret, ♥♥♥♥ blows up hes burning alive you just look at him gain more power no body suspects a thing. 666/10
1481	1	a	The Game Is Awsome Butt You Better Have Nice Computer Because it lags
492	0	a	Framerate is bad on my computer that is WELL above the recommended specs. On top of that I just wasn't drawn into the game. Felt cheap. Interesting premise with the fact that you're the devil's child and all that, just didn't hold my attention.
1483	1	a	TL;DR = I got to squash someones head under a grand piano, 10/10 would play again whilst playing again.  Not a bad game really, played and completed this when it first came out and I remember thinking at the time it wasn't worth the full asking price but as I have now picked it on steam for 90% off it is an absolute steal.  the subject matter is fairly original as I can't remember any other games that let you play as the son of the Devil a la Omen style (please feel free to comment if there are others like this so I can play them).  Graphically it's not too bad at all and sound wise there is some good effects when you are roaming around setting up your little 'accidents'. Options wise, other than the ability to rebind keys and set resolution there aren't many PC options but in all honesty it doesn't really make a difference. I have played this both with a K/M and a 360 Joypad and there is no real difference both are good methods of control for this game.   Buy this on sale play it get the trading cards (there are cards even though they aren't listed on the store page) and unleash your inner Devil.
1485	1	a	Detective mcguffin versus Satanic Machina... I wasnt joking the detective is literally called mcguffin... This game is messed up...
494	0	a	The game seems like it was meant to be something else. The tools are there to make a more freeform game where you could plot deaths but as things stand each 'kill' is pre-detirmined for you and there is only one way to kill that person. A bit too linear
1487	1	a	*Possible to change*   At this point, I have not finished the game but I can confidently say that I enjoy it. I find it kind of buggy and hard to control Lucius at times - which may just be my computer's fault - but overall I like the style, story and idea of the game. You get to play as a (very small but deadly) villian. You get to have Satan as your teacher. You have an open mansion to explore and discover. And you also get to slowly ruin your parents' lives as you cause an omen in their home.   Similar to a point and click game but your given other powers that don't only include picking up objects or shutting off devices etc, but the ability to use telekenesis and mind control and also combustion. You can only acquire your kills in specific ways, you cannot choose the way you kill people. It can be puzzling at times but the map normally guides you around the house and your journal gives you hints at what to do next.   I bought this while it was on sale for $1.99 and I'd reccommend it at that price. It's entertaining and keeps you going. I've been waiting forever to get a hold of this game for cheap and now I'm looking forward to see what Lucius II will be like.
1489	1	a	This game is intensely fun, allowing you to play as the unrepentant villain in a Hitman-style game that never feels to big or too small. As you learn the mansion, you zip around looking for targets, because this game doesn't believe in giving you everything on a silver platter, and I like that. It looks great, and after five hours I only experienced one glitch. My only real complaint is the initial unforgiving nature of the stealh bits, but it's later rectified by a skill you get. This game is worth every penny you spend on it, and I'd reccommend this to anyone who likes stealth-action-puzzle games.
495	0	a	Game has a good idea but unfortunatelly it is too lineer. 
1491	1	a	You can be the son of the devil and kill people 11/10 hell yeah
496	0	a	♥♥♥♥♥
1493	1	a	Mt bom
1495	1	a	i recommend to you this game only if you love to kill people or bobes!!
1497	1	a	personally i really like this game concept  9.5/10
1499	1	a	i love this game so mush i love it A++++++
1501	1	a	Lucius is a puzzle game where your goal is to assasinate people in order to please your father lucifer without being caught in the process, each time you mkae a sacrifice, you become more powerful on one of the different evil magic areas, telekinesis, mind control, mind erase and fireball, altho fireball is only usable in very specific ocasions. The graphics are not bad at all but it's poorly optimized, controls are ok to play with, sadly you can't use a gamepad. Some of the deaths in the game are very gruesome, sadly there's not enough graphics quality to back that up. For achievement hunters this is a easy game to get them all, except the play 20 and 40 hours ones.
1503	1	a	Lucius is a game that puts you in control of a 6 year old spawn of satan. The story is the vein of the classic horror movie, The Omen. 666/777
498	0	a	Rather then a horror game or a game that stresses freedom of choosing whom the character kills, this game is more of a puzzle game... Figuring out how to linearly kill another character whithout getting caught... Not what I expected.
1505	1	a	THIS DOES CONTAIN SOME SPOILERS, BUT IT IS MUCH EASIER TO MAKE EVERYTHING A SPOILER!    Lucius is an outstanding game where you play as a 6 year old boy born on 6-6-1966. Somehow he is the son of Lucifer and notices him as his father, and thus he gains his demonic powers, which you will use to murder, and aid in sucicide, many people. Including your own parents! While you murder the people that goes along with the game story line, police, detectives, and everybody else will start to take cauction in the house. SO BE CAREFUL, and try not to get caught, This may be the only frustrating part of the game. So I would suggest a guide to help get items early to save time later, and so you can understand your main objective. Also enjoy this marvelous game.    95.5/100 bananas :D
1507	1	a	I cant recommend this enough. I love this game after finishing it yesterday i have added it to my top 5 favorites of all time. The story line is amazing. The graphics are amazing. The gameplay is a little challengeing but amazing. I really love thi game and would recommend this to anyone. I love it soo much!
502	0	a	Normally in games playing as the bad guys and killing people is fun. In this Devil's child simulator the act of murder is not satisfying or entertaining, it's an unpleasant chore, because people that you must eliminate to progress through the game, are actually nice men and women and killing them feels like a terrible thing to do. The deaths in this game are way too realistic and unnecessary brutal, the protagonist's character in nonexistent, and the plot is paper-thin. Forgettable and unimpressive.
503	0	a	horrible just horrible.. just sits at the screen with him sitting in bed playing with the toy.. doesnt go any further.. pos game
1509	1	a	This is pretty good. Some bugs, but according to others it's very rare and most people never get them as there may be a 1/20 chance you'll get one per playthrough. In any such case, just restart from the beginning of the chapter. Very fun murder although the plot with the church sounds too circumstantial.
1511	1	a	Its a fun puzzle-game, and the puzzles are all about killing people with unnatural powers. If you ever watch 'The Omen',- this is the game varriant.
1513	1	a	Kinda fun and brutal game where you get to be the son of Satan. It's great that you are not given the straight orders. Instead you are given some clues and you have to figure out what to do. 5/5
1515	1	a	I'll tell you now lucius is no walk in the park for some people. You must think outside the box to get these puzzles and finish your victims. A good game that should be recommended to all those people who love puzzle games!
1517	1	a	I don’t know where I was or what I was doing in 2012, but I can’t see why I did not grab this game sooner. This is one of those games where you get deep into the story so much so that you lose all sense of time until you finish the game and then have that “ what now? look on your face as you thrust for more. I really liked this game.   What I liked:  The storyline: It gives you a bit of background on the Lucius as to he just fell out of the sky. The story make the player connect with him and get personally involved with him. Freaking awesome!!   What I did not like:     Conclusion: This is a game I would highly recommend getting. It may be a bit old, but it is outstanding in my opinion. I did not have any trouble starting the game, or playing it and I don’t recall any bugs that made me not want to play the game. It does have some replay value and a mini survival like game at the end which I liked also. Awesome to say the least.  
507	0	a	Lucius, from what I knew of it, seemed like a great game. It had an interesting premise, the opening animatic looked great, and the idea of killing people to gain devil powers seemed cool. And it is, in theory. The game itself is awful. It's glitchy and even broken at places, the graphics aren't really much, and overall, if I was asked if I'd purchase it again, I wouldn't. You're left to figure out what to do on your own most of the time, with very vague, and very unhelpful clues. The controls are utter rubbish, and you're unsure of how to do anything most of the time. For many things, it's a trial and error kind of process, and while that in itself isn't such a bad thing, here, you must know certain things (such as not stepping in a bedroom, having to crouch just right to kill someone, or having to be just behind a certain object enough to complete an objective) in order to even complete a level. It's great for laughs, though, at various glitches and some deaths.  In short, it's a terrible game and I wouldn't recommend getting it unless you don't mind frustrating controls and poor gameplay in exchange for some confused laughs.
1519	1	a	A great violent game, different ways to kill people and a common but well-told story. supernatural abilities and 2 alternate endings. 8/10
1521	1	a	♥♥♥♥ing Satan simulator  10/10 Would see Tom having sex again
1523	1	a	A good game, good gameplay and okay story 7.5/10 Try it.
1525	1	a	Clunky and poor story but, I still enjoyed the game all the way though.
1527	1	a	If, and only if, you're sick and twisted, like i am, will you enjoy this game... The blood and gore in Lucius is brutal. Even for a gore fan like myself, I even cringed during a few death scenes, and it's so much more brutal because you play a 7 year old child. Lucius, is one of a kind, a child possessed by the devil himself. You then go on a journey of pure carnage, killing the entire household, in many twisted ways. Great game, sometimes it can be frustrating finding the answers to the clues, but its worth it to see the murderous scenes that unfold... The gameplay is nice, runs and looks great, not too long, but not too short either, and the achievements flow in as the game goes on. Noticed today that the game went on sale, with a 95% discount, which is insanely good value for the quality of the game you get. I'm looking forward to completing my remaining achievements, and heading on to Lucius 2. 8/10
509	0	a	This game is glitchy peice of crap.
510	0	a	I want to enjoy the game but it is extremely buggy. Its been out for years yet I don't think there has been any effort to fix those bugs.  It took me around 10 minutes to place the car in the box when trying a new power. I knew what I was suppose to do, but the game refused to let it happen. As well as when the man goes to 'fix' the piano, he starts going back, I'm like uh...hello? aren't you suppose to fix it? I follow him, he goes to the bathroom and says well it must be broken my schedule says it is, lemme check again. Basically its stating I didnt break it when I did. Thats glitchy. Downright glitchy and annoying. Basically I'm just playing this game for achievements / a time saver but I'm dissapointed on how they portrayed the game and the unnecessary glitches.
511	0	a	tl;dr: 'Eh...'  Pros: Hail Satan  Cons: Lacks direction, quite short, bit buggy, somewhat overpriced.
512	0	a	Bad voice acting, cliche dialogue, cheesy horror, bad camera angles, very linear gameplay, horrendous control setup, missions that require too much waiting that fail at your first mistake...  This game just feels like a hassle to play.
1529	1	a	Lucius is a very good horror game! Go for it. You will have a great time. :)
1531	1	a	got game free .... ideal master!!
1533	1	a	im my opinion im a christian but i dont act like one and this game was the opposite of christian and i loved thye gamae like dude what game is better than being able to saw a guys head in half.
1535	1	a	Kill everybody, 10/10 would never...... mhm always play again!
1537	1	a	This game is so ♥♥♥♥. I'm so glad I got it for free.
517	0	a	what a boring ♥♥♥ game. unsensitive control and you have to sprint all the time he walk slow af. money wasted
1539	1	a	This game contains some of the most old school and classic deaths ever just. wow i haven't seen those deaths since Tom &amp; Jerry but instead now the victims actually. But admit it you probably jsut buyed this game because of the nudity didn't you, you probably got a dirty mind. well atleast you didnt't come for the story because that is ♥♥♥♥. it develops poorly let me tell you the story and how it develops. Warning: absolutely jsut boring spoil;ers you probably already new. you turned 6 years old and find out you're the devils son great now go kill people in your household because your dad wants you to that. thats litarelly it. nothing changes! but ofcourse you came here to mess around or for the nudity. you probably came for the nudity (pssst the sex scene is random and the shower scene is at chapter 14 but you haven't heard that from me). and most importantly its a fun game, well if you have dark humor like i do its fun. the gameplay is oke to i guess doesn't have any replay value theres no secrets well theres one but you get there via story progression but for an open world game the fact that theres no secrets just dissapoints me.  +Old School Deaths for all the people who came out there mother before the year 2000. +♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ +Naked Woman, Shower, nuff said. +Fun for people with a dark sence of humor. -♥♥♥♥♥♥ story -No replay value  The game is fun and hilarious but if it had a better story or even the slightest bit of replay value it would had been a higher score. 6/10. The potentiol is there but the developers missed there change. i don't have much hope for the sequel being any better or even good at all but for that we have to wait and see.
518	0	a	At first impression I thought this was going to be a demonic Hitman game but as I've further played this game I noticed this is more of a point-and-click adventure game. Concept is basically collect your items, find your target to eliminate and basically watch the person die. It doesn't really have freedom like the Hitman games unfortunately it's very linear. Quite honestly, the game is a little boring. You're just Lucifer's wild child and you go on a murduring rampage. Nothing too deep about it but it's built upon a generic horror flick. I guess the only thing that makes it worthwhile to see is seeing some pretty gorey cutscenes but other than that it's not worth the full price. I would suggest getting it on sale.
519	0	a	The game looked really promising and it gets to be really cheap on sales (around 90 cents), but it's so buggy that messes up the game.  You literally have to start over chapters due to the game being extremely buggy and causes you to be unable to process the to story.  Cons:  -The facial expressions are the worst. -Memory wipe power was worthless. -Some controls are clunky. -Most abilities are lame. -The House / Enviroment design in the game is rather poor. -The game offers no replayability. -The story is very short, you can beat the game in around 2-3 hours (if you can stand playing it for that much). -Too linear. -Boring concept.  Pros:  -You can ride a tricycle on your way to commit murder.
1541	1	a	Really enjoyed this game. Unique concept and great story.   My only negatives are that there was always a 'right' ability to use and finding some of the stuff was fairly difficult. 
521	0	a	It was fun at first. Quickly got borning and repeated.
1543	1	a	The game was actually boring
1545	1	a	I really like this game. I'm going to college to be a criminal/forensic psych major. So this is candy for me! :)
524	0	a	Recomend or not. It is hard to decide with this game.  The graphics arn't that good, but for the price I have seen worse. It is a very linear game with not that many options of what to do or not. The majority of the achievements are easy and fun to get if you ignore the 20 hour and 40 hour achievement. The game is much to short to get them without wasting electricity of the pc keeping the game active while you find something more interesting to do.   The ways you have to kill people is midly creative and fun to find out, but that is pretty much where the fun ends.
1547	1	a	Lucius, the son of Lucifer, I love this game, it is amazing, one of my favorite games. I recommend it to you. It's kinda difficult, it has some bugs, but it is still a good game. I recommend it to you.
1549	1	a	Lucius is more of a puzzle game then anything else. There's 18 chapters in the game and each chapter, your goal is to kill a specific person of the Dante Manor, with the exception that some chapters you kill multiple people. It took me about 7 hours to beat this game and I feel like it was worth the money I spent while it was on sale (I beleive $5). Some missions were pretty easy to figure out while others were mearly impossible because the game didn't give you any sense of direction. In some chapters, you only have to find a couple of things to complete the mission, while others, you have to do a list of things. One thing I kept on forgetting was while playing was combining items, (for those of you who haven't played, you get batteries and a flashlight, you select the batteries and then place them in the flashlight). The games does a lot of combining items to make them useful to you, so make sure you don't forget that! Anyways, the quality of the game was iffy. The details seemed pretty fair, but when it goes to cutscenes where people talk, you can tell they didn't pay much attention to making the mouth open when you hear words. The story line made sence to me, like, you will kill a specific person first and then a character that was related to the person you just killed will get depressed and that would be your next target. Overall, I'd give this game a 5/10. I'm only giving it 5 because the story was short and the game didn't really help me with completing chapters which made it frustrating to figure out.  I would only buy it on sale if possible. There is a Lucius 2 which I'll be playing soon.
1551	1	a	The game was pretty, engaging &amp; overall pleasant experience. I really like the cheeky, yet simple storyline, &amp; exploring is a bunch of fun.   My experience: Personally I love exploring, &amp; I seemed to rush ahead from the story so when I went exploring I would find items or places specified for a chapter, &amp; get confused with the items &amp; places alot. They had a weird balance between being able to interact with some future chapter items, while some not at all, which didn't help me. When the eye icon showed up &amp; I clicked it, for particular things it wouldn't say anything which to me defeats the purpose of putting an eye icon.   Needs fixing: I had trouble at chapter 19 because the head statue I was meant to use didn't spawn in the right spot.  Recommendations: Chores are great, I was able to get all the gifts in the first 2 chapters. Make sure to read the clues carefully, &amp; look around the rooms to find all the items &amp; hints u can find. If u are really stuck hold an item up that u expect to use, &amp; it will give u a indicator to show u where to place it. Use ur abilities wisely &amp; u will do great.
526	0	a	The controls made this almost unplayable, I wish I could have used my controller though it would have only helped slightly. You move so slowly and if you try to run it goes crazy which makes manuevering around very hard and disorienting. I saw potential but I can't play this game with these controls...
1553	1	a	Good game it teach me how to be a psycho and how i feel to be a son of demon
1555	1	a	666/10 will kill again.. and again.. and again! AND AGAIN!
1557	1	a	So I'm not one to play games with a linear storyline from beginning to end. But Lucius was one of those games, though could use some work, had me entertained throuhgout... I mean how often can you play the son of the devil and go around killing people?   I do recommend this game and even though it's not a huge game it's still very enjoyable.  I did a full playthrough of the game, just in case you get stuck at some points. Here's the first episode to taste what the game has in store for you.   https://youtu.be/yeizmSoOvsM   
1559	1	a	If you ever dream to be that demon lovechild no one ever wanted and a bunch of fanbases scattering around to praise your mighty-ness whatevs, at least Mr. Lucifer is your father.   but mom hates you dad hates you your servants hates you grandpa hates you police hates you.  10/10 recomend. 
1561	1	a	This game is all about doing chores, hanging around in the house, and trying to kill the people you don't like. And that's basically my life too.
1563	1	a	Very linear gameplay would have been fantastic to let loose and murder them all as you see fit whilst trying to cover up everything you do so they dont figure who you really are but that being said it has a story so it probs needed a linear stucture for its own purpose for what it is; it was a good game and i enjoyed lil jimmys murdering antics.   - 'Best background windowed running game simulator' you can get!   666/10 would leave the game running in the background in a small window again....
1565	1	a	REALLY FUN GAME has a few issues but still fun game
1567	1	a	Why Is My Game In A 3D Effect Please Help Turn It Off
1569	1	a	Good, but story too short. :/
1571	1	a	It was rather fun a murder puzzle when you do the kiling. Simple but entertaining
529	0	a	I really didnt like this game, my friends invited me to play this game i spent 15 dollars on it i think,  all the hype came from pewdipie i guess.   4/10
1573	1	a	We are part Satan in this game.   RECOMMEND  10/10 
530	0	a	Bugs, bugs, bugs, inconsistencies, stupid scenario, low fluidity, bugs.
1575	1	a	Shoved a man's face into a lawnmower, would do again.
531	0	a	In my opinion the game was ok at first some bugs, and glitches here and there, then came the midnight missions you only have to do two. Now the first one was easy but the other i was hiding behind a door and someone saw me. Tried to use memory wipe but it was useless. Overall the game is ok but i just do not like it.
532	0	a	This game is so buggy. So slow, it's only 16-18 FPS when the gameplay start but it goes 60 FPS when the movie play, We don't watch the movie dude, we want to play!!!
1577	1	a	Remember in Oblivion (Elder Scrolls Series) when you're in the dark brotherhood and you get to kill the house guests? This is a roided up version of that very short quest. But you can't be too blunt or obvious about your kills, no crouching with a sword this time, instead you've got to watch them, learn what they do... and proceed through your plan to ultimately sacrifice them to your 'father'.  Its a great game and I recommend everyone try it at least once.
1579	1	a	Cool Game.
1581	1	a	Good, but story too short. :/
1583	1	a	Always wanted to worship our lord and savior Lucifer?, the lord of the underworld, but your parents never allowed you, then this is the game for you.
1585	1	a	Super sometimes stealth and sometimes bug :D (BUG TO MAKE IT FASTER)
1587	1	a	Well its easy:   - Don't play if you're a good person!
1589	1	a	.
1591	1	a	Well ! I have finished the game in 10-11 hours . The game was fun ! Really fun ! Some puzzles were harder but it is not so hard ! I think i will replay this game in the future !I like the ideea of beeing a 6 year old son of a rich family and kill all the members of the house...one by one ... story 9/10 ....muzic 9/10 .... overall 8.5/10
533	0	a	Would love to play this game, purchased it, but it does not work with my hardware. The scroll on the mouse doesn't work correctly, so you get to a point you can't do anything.. You can't modify that control setting, so you are pretty much screwed.. It looks like it would be a good story, but it's like a book missing half the pages.. get's to the point that it is a waste of time..
1593	1	a	I mean who doesn't wanna play the Devil's son and go around killing your family's hired help?
1595	1	a	It's a tough call to recommend Lucius. The premis behind the game is solid. You play as the anti-christ being trained by you real father aka Satan to hone your powers on your birth parents and their staff by killing them all one at a time without being caught. The execution however is rocky at best. Stiff animations and an overwhelming lack of instruction leaves the experience more frusterating than it needed to be. One more than one occasion I started a chapter not knowing who my target was so I wandered the huge property of the mansion, checking every room I could think of for nearly 45 minutes before I finally caved and checked online. That's a bad sign for game design. This is an indie title and if it wasn't released during the Halloween season there's no way the producers would be able to justify the $30 price tag. My bet, this title is going to see a price drop and if you're curious about it, wait for it to a $5 sale and pick it up, otherwise, you're not missing a lot here.
1597	1	a	This game gave me a good impiression for the neat graphic. Although I could go and search within the limited area of a mansion, the graphic of furniture and art works is detailed and well placed. I would enjoy the scenery if this game was just a walking simulator. I also enjoyed the cut scenes that are adding good charm on the atmosphere. However, the puzzle was confusing for me. The player can collect items for the current chapter and for the next chapter or for any other at the same time. That means if a certain puzzle that I thought was for the current chapter was about to be solved, I couldn't pass the current chapter since it's supposed later. Sometimes I lost my way wondering what I should do next. But anyway, we can see the game guides that are already posted, so it wasn't a big deal for me. The story is so-so, having a little twist but overall linear. This is an evil vs justice story which sounds typical, but the protagonist is on the evil side. Voice acting is also satisfactory and it has English subtitle.
1599	1	a	Awesome game, cool content and great 'killcams' :D
1601	1	a	Best and most goreful villain simulator ever. Also nude and sex scenes for forever virgins like me.
1603	1	a	10/10
1605	1	a	Nice game!
1607	1	a	Got this on sale, never finished the game, but I can just barely recommend this. It's good to play for awhile in the beginning, but after a few murders it starts to get a bit repetitive. I quit after the reporter guy in the basement. The house is also extremely easy to get lost in, especially since you have no minimap and have to open the map over and over to make sure you're going in the right direction.
1609	1	a	When I bought this game I thought it'd be a quick little indy game that only lasted an hour or so. In reality it's pretty long for the price, and really fun. I got this and part two for 6 bucks in a steam sale, though i'd have been happy had i paid 20. Nice graphics if you care about that sort of thing, and well put together. So far I haven't had any problems with glitches and such either. I like this game a lot and it's pretty creative when it comes to how you kill your targets. It's dark, sinister, and you really feel like a creepy little devil child. It almost feels similar to a less complex hitman game, though instead of an assassin you're a devil child with a few satanic powers.
1611	1	a	..
1613	1	a	ur an evil kid trying to annihilate ur own family.
1615	1	a	this is the best game i am the son of satan 10/10 for killing the plumber
1617	1	a	Two words defines this game. THE OMEN.
1619	1	a	Great game,very hard,but still a great one 10/10 would kill people again
1621	1	a	Good game totally worth it ..
536	0	a	Lucius is an compelling complete mess of a game that sadly manages to sour itself right at the end.  The game is a point and click game where you play as Lucius, a 6 year old millionare child that for some reason is in leagues with Satan, and is tasked to kill the other people in his house discretely to harvest their souls. Everything in the game takes place within the giant open family mansion where you have to gather clues, find items and do your chores to figure out the solutions to puzzles involving killing people in more or less creative ways.  This is all conveyed in the style of a 70's B-horror movie akin to The Exorcist, only it seems to be somewhat aware (or charmingly unaware) of the goofyness of the situation and cranks up the cheese to hillarious degrees, with overuse of 666 symbolism, slow motion head explosions and cartoonishly unlikable house residents to murder. The game's attempts at horror falls incredibly flat out of the gate in other words, though it do manage to be bloody hillarious instead which is what got me hooked through the entire thing.  Because the thing is, the game itself is not very good. A lot of the time you are given very vague hints of what to do and it ends up with tons of walking around the house searching for interactive items, the magic powers you get such as levitation and mind control only seems to want to work half of the time, there is some horrible early 2000's license game style sneaking sections, and the final boss fight was completely broken for me until I reloaded a save. The game also has ludicrous loading times even on high end computers, and it looks like an upscaled PS2 game in a lot of regards despite seeming to use a surprising ammount of power to run.  However along with those bad things are a lot of fun 'bad' things too. The physics engine is super wonky and makes doors and objects flip out at times, which is especially apparent with the ragdoll physics going into full Goat Simulator mode whenever they happen outside of cutscenes (if you get hold of the gun earlier than intended you can have a lot of fun with this). You can unlock a tricycle to help move around the house quicker, which breaks the laws of physics around stairs and other things. You sometimes spawn mid air or partway underground when starting a mission. Lots of weird unintended wacky things that is really funny whenever it do happen.  The truly bad parts really do tear it down a lot though, so even if I did enjoy big chunks of this game in a Troll 2 sort of way, the truly abysmal parts dragged it way too much down to outright recommend it. If you are interested in so bad it's good horror cheese and physics wackyness, grab it on a sale, but stay away at the current full price.
1623	1	a	clunky but fun
537	0	a	too easy to beat
1625	1	a	Definantly recommended for hours upon hours of fun. This game is excellent for those who are into horror-ish ames, or, with the right sense of humor, a few good laughs.
1627	1	a	When I originally bought this game, I was unsure if I was going to like it or not. Let me start off by saying I really did enjoy this game. One thing I should mention is that I personally didn't believe this game was so much of a 'horror game', it was more of an interesting story about a posessed boy, nothing in the game is really 'scary'; however, the game doesn't fail to include several violent and gorey death scenes. Only complaint about the game was that it went a little quicker than I wanted it to, but luckily, Lucius 2 is available to anyone who enjoyed the game!!!!!!! Would definetly recommend to anyone who is up for an interesting (but not too lengthy) story.
1629	1	a	This is not a scary game... It's evil, you are the scary. So far though i've been loving how the games plays out aside from the fact that my map was drawn by a 6-year-old and finding out what/how to kill the next subject is explained. They say you have to listen to the people around the house but they are very vague. It's like they took lessons from castlevania 2.   Aside from that though the games controls are pretty good and simple. Graphics aren't bad either aside from when some areas are too dark. All in all 7/10
1631	1	a	I love this game. I wish I could be a murderous child chosen by Satan in real life, but this is okay too.
1633	1	a	this game make my laptop working so hard ,i hope this thing not gonna blowup -_- ,but i like this game and game play is really cool,hope you add Graphic Setting on option ,
1635	1	a	im my opinion im a christian but i dont act like one and this game was the opposite of christian and i loved thye gamae like dude what game is better than being able to saw a guys head in half.
1637	1	a	This game is so ♥♥♥♥. I'm so glad I got it for free.
1639	1	a	You're a kid trying to kill your parents so basically you're in a really gory Stewie focused episode of Family Guy
1641	1	a	8/10. This was a hoot and a half. Surprisingly difficult in parts, too. A TON of cut scenes, but the fact that you're playing the evil character somewhat makes up for it. I do recommend it, but be prepared for those cut scenes!  Pros: -Story -Puzzles -Someone has done walkthroughs  Cons: -Too many cut scenes
1643	1	a	Very fun. Don't go into the game as a sandbox murder game (that's the sequel). It's a puzzle game and as such there is not a lot of replayablity as there is usually only one way to solve the puzzles. Think of it more like a 3D Phoenix Wright game and you'll enjoy it. Little Lucius is very fun little murderer to play as and watching the family (especially the mother) go nuts as the body count in the house rises is a treat. The murders are also all pretty inventive and fun to watch. Some are just downright gruesome. Give it a playthrough with these things in mind and you'll probably like it.
1645	1	a	Really loved the game, and obviously the fact of beeing son of the devil &gt;:3. Funny to play, average cutscenes, but not as interactive and 'free' as lucius 2 in my opinion, cuz you have to follow the rules and have limited space to work with. BUT, it doesnt prevent it to be a good game!  Probably a 8/10, and recommendable! :D
1647	1	a	Honestly Ive played through this game and almost 100%'ed the achievments, in my personal opinion a brillaint game would definatley recomend it. I found hours flying by and me saying to my self, just one more murder. The story lines okay could be better but overal I'd definatley say give it a chance.
1649	1	a	i enjoyed it. killing everyone + my parents was pretty cool. the only thing i disliked about it was how ambiguous the puzzles were, things got better whenver i realised i had to do the chores my mom told me to do in order to get a compass which sort-of-kind-of shows you where to go.... who am i kidding, the compass is sh it.
1651	1	a	Its a good game yo, get it, i wouldnt of paid more than £6.99 on it though
1653	1	a	Excellent game. Only thing I don't like is the walking + camera mechanics, they seem off but easy to get used to. Definitely a creepy game with interesting cut scenes.
1655	1	a	The obvious vote for the game will be 6,66/10 (isn't funny?). No, really, the game is somewhere in between 6 and 7. Worth a try.
1657	1	a	As you can see I haven't played this game so much yet, but I've already found a couple of issues with the game, that's quite off putting for me.  First of all, the 3rd person view they've decided on using for the game, is incredibly annoying. Lucious's head is in the way a lot of the time if you need to have a closer look at things (which you often do), and at too far a distance, it gets hard to see what's hidden inside all the drawers and cupboards.  Secondly, I have to admit I was a tiny bit disappointed at the lack of a 'sandbox' mode, when this game is being described by the developers as 'Open World'. I can accept the premise that the house and the surroundings is the only area you can be in, but the fact that it isn't sandboxed, and it feels like you're being forced to do things in a certain way (where's the fun in that?) is definitely a bit off putting.   However, when all that's said and done, I haven't played that game that much yet (mainly because of the 3rd person issue), so as such, this review can mostly comment on the mechanics of the game.   The actual game itself, and the premise for it, seems amazing (which is why I bought it in the first place), so hopefully these things will manage to negate the drawbacks of the game.  I'm still having trouble getting into the game because of the way they made 3rd person viewing, and the lack fo any 1st person viewing, but I'd still reccommend this game try, if you happen to find it on offer.
1659	1	a	can i have some help after the intro it just gives me a black screen but the music is playing
1661	1	a	My name is my own, but I assure you, it is important. My review is rather simple and to the point; Luciud is a fantastic game insofar as it is not only well written and acted, especially for an 'indie' developer, but the game itself is rather well made, easy to learn and presented well. The graphics, while not on the level of those super-realistic new games, are just as good as any, and better than I would expect to see. The voice acting, whilst not always on-cue, is itself fair. I have yet to finish the game, but I also have yet to encounter any sort of graphical, scripting or other errors one usualy finds in the 'bigger' games of today, bugs being so prevailient within most engines, I am supprised to find a 'clean' game. Now for the story, the one thing I hold highest in any game. The story is amazing, well written, well executed and in plain simple english, it is great. If this game were a book, it would be a great read and I would have trouble putting it down. You can be assured that apon completion of this game, I will be purchasing the next Lucius title, quite happily.
1663	1	a	This game is hard as a Mofo. It's very confusing (you need a walkthrough because stuff just isnt obv.) Maybe im just horrible and stupid? PROBABLY :p. The graphics are nice, its not crisis but its surprisingly pleasing to look at and runs great on maxed settings. I'd say its a mixture of a puzzle game and a horror/supernatural thriller mystery? Yeah that works. I wouldnt pay the full $10 but on sale it's a great addition and lasts around 6-10 hours. :) I give it a 7/10.
1665	1	a	Great game with a great story. The controls are sometimes frustrating, but its not really a big issue. The story is kinda short. Still its one of the best indie games on steam
1667	1	a	Why Does it Feels so Good ! So Good To Be Bad !
1669	1	a	Super fun though it ran a little slow (Probably my computers fault) but it was still very playable 10/10 would play again.
542	0	a	This game makes its players struggle through its endless bugs, truly awful voice acting/animation, and cheesy dialouge with overuse of slow motion that gives the game an almost comedic tone.  Never the less, I did force my way though the levels, and I still got some fun out of it, but otherwise I'd really not reccomend this. It is just too shoddily made. 4/10.
1671	1	a	A sadistic little piece of ♥♥♥♥ kills everyone in the house including priests?! Love it. 5/7.
1673	1	a	So in this game you play as a kid who kills people........also hes ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  Get this game.
1675	1	a	thsi game is fun and the creative ways to kill people are awesome. only problem i had was the camera was not what i was used to, but it was still good.
1677	1	a	This game is short but sweet it took me 7 hours to finish and is a breath of fresh air, original, fun and keeps you wanting to see the story unfold.  I really enjoyed this game despite having issues with fps drops all the time on low settings with better then recommended specs.  Still really good game and worth playing 7/10
1679	1	a	Freaking amazing so far, I am having fun haha my thoughts considering I haven't finished yet I am hooked at the countless possibilities, I am gonna see it through! If anyone needs a gameplay on it!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKEEXCM7wx8 
1681	1	a	10/10
1683	1	a	It's a good game, but if you outsmart the game, it breaks
1685	1	a	I enjoyed this game. You're on a pretty tight leash and can't do things creatively, but each person has a specific death with an absurd cutscene. Sometimes its quite difficult trying to figure out what to do and you'll find yourself running around the mansion for a long time looking for a small item, but you eventually figure it out. I had fun playing this and would recommend it. Not the best game out there, but worth it, especially if it goes on sale.
1687	1	a	This game is all about doing chores, hanging around in the house, and trying to kill the people you don't like. And that's basically my life too.
1689	1	a	nice game, i found this game in youtube, when pewdiepie play it.
1691	1	a	This game is amazing and so great. It's like Hitman, so if you're a fan of Hitman then you'll love this game too
1693	1	a	anti-christ? anarchist? kill them all. rule the world, watch it burn!
1695	1	a	10/10 would kill again.
546	0	a	Give me back my money
1697	1	a	This is a terrific interactive horror. I reccommend wholeheartedly.
1699	1	a	Nice game.
1701	1	a	This game is so amazing that I couldn't put it down until I finished it. I finished in a single playthrough that took 6 hours. The concept is interesting, the graphics and soundtrack are quite good, the gameplay is great and the story is intriguing. Despite all the controversy surrounding this game for obvious reasons, I still recommend it. It's nice to play the bad person for once in a video game, that is what makes Lucius refreshing. The music is creepy enough to set the tone of the game and the controls are easy to use. Go buy it if you want to play it, I had a fun time with it, and I believe you won't be disappointed
1703	1	a	It Game so Good
1705	1	a	I can finally be the evil dude in a game! Ever wanted to be the murderous son of Satan? Oh you have!? Then get Lucius! :D
1707	1	a	Is a good horror game .
1709	1	a	Hastalavistagaming played it and its AWESOME
1711	1	a	  pretty good game
1713	1	a	Too scared to play this by myself  10/10
1715	1	a	Lucius was a lot of fun. Bought 1 and 2 on sale for around 5 bucks. Definitely recommend!
1717	1	a	im on ♥♥♥♥in rampage
1719	1	a	You play as Lucius a little boy who receives orders from the Devil himself ordering you to kill various people in the mansion in where you live.  In order to do this you will have to roam the huge mansion in search of items which you can use. Figuring out which items to use on a person and how to perform the execution without being caught can be tricky and you will have to use your brain to figure out the best way.  Overall a pretty fun game grab it when it's on sale, it only takes around 9 hours to complete and the achievements are easy.
1721	1	a	This game is fun and interesting, but sometimes funny glitches pop up.  Also don't expect too much, because there are some annoying bugs. Achievements are easy and fast to do, except 'I like this game' and 'I'm Addicted' achievements.  Good story, fun to kill those people, good sounds.  8.5/10 
1723	1	a	Amazing game, Thanks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ^^
549	0	a	I really want to like this game. I want to like it so much that I played through the whole thing, despite realizing how bad it was going to be 20 minutes in. It's right up my alley with its grizley subject matter and over-the top style. Everything is lovably purple, with the number 666 showing up pretty much anywhere any kind of number is called for. On that level the game is brilliant.   But aside from a lovable style, there's not actually much of a game here. There's no freedom, no challenge. Each level drops you into the house, where you follow a line on a map until you run into a certain NPC. The game shouts 'There! That's the person you're trying to kill on this level!' Then you check your notebook for some hint at how the game wants you to get that job done. You follow that hint until you reach another hint, then follow that hint, and so on, until someone dies. There's never more than a single path towards killing any given target, so there's no decisions to be made. The only thing that might actually be considered a challenge is figuring out what the hints mean. The hints oscilate between so obvious as to be trivial, and so obtuse as to be useless. There's no happy middle between the two. No sense of satisfaction in figuring stuff out.   Then there are the times when you need a tool that isn't already in your inventory. Some specific item, like a screwdriver. Your first instinct is to go look for where you'd keep a screwdriver in your own home. Is it in the garage? The tool shed? Nope. It's on a table in the sitting room. You just have to wander around aimlessly, scanning every drawer and surface while you wonder if you're missing something that would make this fun.   The demonic powers are also a little annoying. I could ignore the fact that the telekenisis never feels right, or that the fireballs are basically only available in pre-scripted sections of the game. That stuff, to a degree, makes sense. But the ability to make people forget seeing you doesn't even work! The moment your seen, all of the controls go completely dead, so there's no opportunity to use it. I went so far as intentionally getting caught multiple times in a row just to try and figure out what I was doing wrong, but it's no use.   The game's cutscenes are too numerous and too boring. And even as numerous as they are, they often fail to explain things. Without spoiling anything, the game's story makes a few strange leaps forward that I still don't really understand. Several characters apparently come out of nowhere. Halfway through the game everyone starts talking about my uncle. Your mom even tells you to stop bothering your uncle, because he's been complaining about you lately. Meanwhile I'm left to wonder who or where my uncle is, because it's the first time I'm hearing about him.   I'm disappointed that the game wound up being as bland and boring as it is. The graphics are nice and clear, the controls are mostly pretty solid, the deaths are reasonably creative. In most respects the game is a competently assembled thing. But there are just too many problems for me to give it a blanket recommendation.   I'd say you should buy it only if you meet two criteria: 1. You, like me, think the premise is AWESOME.  2. It's on sale for less than $3.   Otherwise, give this a pass.
550	0	a	A short way in and already frustrated. I can't stand it anymore. It's not like it has no shred of entertainment value, but I find it far from a fun game.   It's linear, so you have no choices in how it goes - I had hoped for a little more creative space, but that's my faulty expectation I guess. It's more like a chore-like puzzle than anything else. At one point you need to gather laundry... somehow you can only do this one ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sock at a time. It's a minor thing, but the annoyance builds. And why the hell do I need to do that with 2 housekeepers in the house? WTF.  It's buggy... I had a bug right at the cinematic after the tutorial. Lip sync is off, clipping in animations. At one point you need to avoid your mother, but her pathing is so utterly ♥♥♥♥♥♥ that she gets stuck on the staircase, or in an open doorway, fails to open a door and just keep walking at and away from it.... and half the time the game just games over right there. I just can't get past after 8 tries. It's bloody annoying, because it's not the challenge but the game that keeps me from progressing. At other point you just know that you need to use a specific item, but you move on because your cursor doesn't trigger a use function... only to find out wih google you needed to target a specific micro part that takes a while to get your cursor on right. Come on...  After a bit I just lost interest. Oh, another person needs to die. Okay. It's a nice theme, but the gaming element is just weak. I will try to finish it, but it just feels like driving with the handbrake on and a steering wheel that will only turn left.  EDIT after a few more hours: On the last few missions, my save file is corrupt and I can't play it. It just crashes when I load it and I really can't be bothered to start the earlier mission again. The entire experience was meh, no replayability, the steam achievements are not challenging because you get them after each scripted kill. I spent near to no money on it, so no harm done there, but damn don't bother with this.
1725	1	a	I wish that I could show you the screenshots I took while playing this game. Lucius came at the right time for me after playing a game that had no killing whatsoever, and I am so happy to say that it overdelivered in terms of the violence I was looking for. Despite the graphics being undercooked for a game that's only a couple of years old, the voice acting being a little under par, and almost every puzzle in the game consisting of only four steps, what Lucius lacks in polish it certainly more than makes up for in graphic, satisfying, violence. Having picked this one and it's sequel up for less than a cup of coffee in a recent sale, I probably wouldn't have even played the first instalment except that I saw it had been released in the last couple of years. ♥♥♥♥ I'm glad I did though, because it would have been a huge mistake to miss out on this little gem! Reminiscent of early PS2 games like Hitman, just shorter, and with more gore and less guns... but Satan... and a tricycle... so yay.
551	0	a	I bought this and Lucius II in a bundle (I haven't played Lucius II yet) for like $1.75 or something.  For the price, I guess it's been okay?  It feels really empty, poorly explained, the video and audio aren't synced at all, and it just seems like the game is trying to keep you busy with simple tasks over and over.  It's like a poorly made Hitman clone, but with only one way to kill each person.  Rating: 2.3 / 10
1727	1	a	Anti-Christ Simulator 2012   Probably the only simulator game you can find out there with a story.
1729	1	a	The game has some really inspired visuals and interesting ideas; the plot is simple, but the storytelling is neat, with backstories and subplots, and the and everything is entertaining for the whole duration of the game. Some bugs and interactions may be cause of involuntary hilarity: higly recomanded for fans of b-movies 
1731	1	a	DO NOT miss a chance to pick up this game for the discounted steam price! I repeat! I mean cmon you play the son of Lucifer. the stealth mechanics are one of a kind and spot on, the story line is wonderful, there is loads of sublte, dark humour throughout the entire game. this game was very well planned out and put together! please play the first before you play the second. did i mention you play the son of lucifer. puzzle meets stealth, gorefest, with thrills and chills. its a must own. no real glitchs either. runs smooth and offers hours of fun.  8/10
1733	1	a	Apart from some glitch encountered with the notebook and chores missions, it's one of the funniest game I've played. Awsome achievements!
1735	1	a	After completing this after around 10 hours, I guess I have a few things to say about this game.   The only game I have played that is similar to this would be Among The Sleep. You know, where you're playing as a child and you'd really hate to see the kid get mauled by anything. Only this is different. ATS is a cute little toddler with his teddy, Lucius is a little psychopath and he reminds me of that kid from Ju-On. There's an order where people get killed by this little prick. You'll also need specific items to kill them. Maybe you'd want to blast them all to buggery with this fancy fire power thing you get half-way into the game but NO, you can't because that power only comes back to you occasionally (for reasons beyond me), you have to fart around the entire manor getting items needed to orchestrate the perfect murder. Most of the time you'll be on Youtube watching walkthroughs because you've run around the manor so much you're getting motion sickness and WHERE IS THIS STUPID TRASH THIS WOMAN WANTS ME TO TAKE OUT.   Get it during a sale, like I did. I wouldn't pay its full price even though it's only £7 because I am tight like that.
1737	1	a	This game that put a smile on my face. ( ﾟ ∀ ﾟ )
1739	1	a	  I'm always scared yet I'm the one causing terror (ू˃̣̣̣̣̣̣o˂̣̣̣̣̣̣ ू)³₌₃
1741	1	a	Loveable, cuddly, with just a bit of evil.
1743	1	a	After playing this game i literally googled 'how to make a pact with satan'.. The game has nice storyline and convinced me I could be the decendent of lucifer (praise be to him) himself.. Anyone who loves to manipulate peoples' life and be the cause of their suffering then play this game..Finished it in a few days though with some walkthrough help..
1745	1	a	Lucius is a very fun game. The story is very fun and it can be very chalenging at times. I am not one to like puzzle games but I found my self really enjoying this one. It is a great mix between a horror game and a puzzle game. Overall, I would give this game a 8/10 and I would recomend it.
1747	1	a	This game gave me the weirdest boner. Anyone else with me.
1749	1	a	  Now now, who doesn't like to brutally murder some people? I surely awakens that little devil that's hidden deep within you~
1751	1	a	First time getting a boner from a horror game.
1753	1	a	Its a pretty good game. I finished it in about 7 hours.... (the rest was just in idle to get achievements). It has some bugs still, and maybe its my computer but the graphics are alittle wonky at some points. Either way, it was a fun game, and I'm glad i bought it.
1755	1	a	very entertaining and SPOOKY
1757	1	a	Killing people the the anti-christ with mind powers is fun &lt;3
1759	1	a	Very surreal game, totally gonna ruin my life 11/11 love it
1761	1	a	i like trains but this is good game
1763	1	a	Finished this game within 9 hours and now I have to wait (idling) another 31 hours to fully complete all the achievements. Ggwp!
1765	1	a	This is one of my favorite games. If you like stealth or assassin games, you'll like this one.
1767	1	a	Hard as ♥♥♥♥ and also for a bagde
1769	1	a	Nothing would make me happier than if this game was brought to XBLA!
1771	1	a	A really misunderstood kid is Lucius, one of the creepiest kids in games but so utterly, devastatingly adorable beyond measure!!!
1773	1	a	old but good story
1775	1	a	good game but dont take your time in between plays or swap with a controller in between you will forget all controls (or at leastr i did) and have to start over
1777	1	a	For as awful as this game handles there's a certain satisfaction in finally solving the puzzle that makes your groundskeeper stick his head in a lawnmower. The schlock writing and audio lifted from  FreeSounds.com  (which accounts for over half of the credits) makes this a fun, if very... VERY flawed, experience. Suggest to get on sale, if possible.
556	0	a	As much as I love the thought of channeling my inner steamy Satan, the glitches in this game are too much for me. End of Chap. 2 when practicing Telekinesis, the cardboard box doesn't even spawn to put the car in. Restarted multiple times. Replayed both chapters multiple times. Redownloaded once. Even left it running for 30min at the bug for the hell of it. -Peace out Dante Manor-
1779	1	a	reminds my of a horror move and as a 'expert' horror movie watcher as myself i realy appriceated the story line along with the pulling attraction of suspence 8/10 
1781	1	a	I didn't have high expectations for Zombie Driver HD, but it's suprisingly good fun mowing down zombies in your car! My fav mode to play is Slaughter (survival) where the zombies keep coming which also has an online scoreboard to challenge your friends. Story mode is repetitive and gets pretty boring; there is a lot of content for the money though! Blood Racing is OK but most enjoyable once you get a good ride. Decent array of weaponry &amp; cars to choose from which are all upgradable (off course :p).         Aussiedroid's ZD:HD Players Handbook&nbsp;
1783	1	a	This is a strange little game really - it's kind of like super sprint and micro machines but in a sort of open world setting where you do missions which involve driving from A to B and you have to kill as many zombies as possible. Its a great little mish mash of genres to create something a little bit different and it works. It even has boss fights too.   It also has a racing career mode too and the races are kinda nuts really as you try stay in front, kill zombies and win to earn more money to buy better cars, upgrades and weapons.   The only real con to the game so far is the poor voice acting but then I didnt buy this for the voice acting or immersion really. I just wanted a fun little game to go between other games that didnt require me to amass an encyclopedias worth of knowledge about builds, techniques startegies etc but would let me rip loose and feel like a boss. This game does that.  It aint no FORZA but then you don't get to kill zombies in FORZA. brought it on sale - totally worth the money.  ---- edit --- and still loving it a few weeks later. Ace game to go to everynow and again for thoughless violence
1785	1	a	Turn your brain off fun. Great amount of entertainment for the price. I actually made money by selling the cards that I got from the game. Win/Win.
1787	1	a	I bought it for the badge and the 'cute' red skull-emoticon. But it is surprisingly entertaining and varied, if you hate pedestrians... It looks very nice and gory - must have been forgotten by the german FSK-moralizers. Car's control sufficiently, but don't use the keyboard, otherwise your hand drops off.   Nice. - 7.5/10
1789	1	a	Zombie Driver HD: The remake of... Zombie Driver. Both games are mad fun. This one is prettier. Not really a lot I can say about the game. You are a cabbie who winds up in the middle of a zombie outbreak and gets press-ganged into working for the military. But he gets chainguns on his cab so cool I guess. You shoot stuff and get money. Three different modes: Story, Blood race, and Slaughter. Story you know, Blood Race is best out of X number of rounds tournaments with different game modes and slaughter is arena zombie killing. Stupid fun, moderately easy to 100%. Get it sucka.
1791	1	a	Look like GTA top down style view but it's still very interesting! :'&gt;
1793	1	a	This game is simple is awesome! I have several friends who play and leader board competitions between friends keeps me coming back to defend my scores. The graphics are well done and the physics are excellent. Playing with a controller makes the game more enjoyable as well. Hoping for Zombie Driver 2 with multiplayer.
1795	1	a	        YouTube™ Video:  Cheap PC Games: Zombie Driver HD Review&nbsp;
1797	1	a	This remake of Zombie Driver adds some new content and modes to play, though the modes are kinda useless the base game itself is still very enjoyable and fun. A top down isometric GTA style view except now with more zombehs. Choose diff vehicles and enjoy mowing them all down. The plus for the remake in HD is the controls work much better instead of the confused mess they were in the last version. The tournament mode is sorta meh, rubberband racer AI, weird things that make your car flip over or spin around. Ignoring the modes which are a failed experiment, the game itself gives what all zombie fans want more of, more zombies! Lots of replayability with mission select so you can test out all the cars to get your zombie fix.  Rating: 10/10 Value: $9.99
1799	1	a	How many ways are there to kill zombies now? A lot more than there needs to be, that’s for sure. I was socially inept enough to jump on the zombie bandwagon before it was cool, back before 28 Days Later and the Zombie Survival Guide brought them back from their long post-Thriller twilight. I’ve cooled on them enough that zombies as a bullet point is more likely to drive me away from a game, so keep that in mind while I explain just how much I enjoy Zombie Driver HD.  The main draw of Zombie Driver is the story mode, posing you as a nameless motorist in a city beset by the undead plague. Every mission takes place on the same wide-open GTA-style map, sending you to different areas to rescue survivors, destroy zombie strongholds, or defeat enormous bosses. Ramming is sufficient to splatter most zombies but for bigger targets there are weapon pickups scattered all over, giving you machine guns or flamethrowers to cull the hordes with. You’ll also find repair pickups (which you will need because damage can come in huge bursts) and money, used between missions to upgrade your cars. And that is cars plural, because you unlock sports cars and limos and police cruisers over the course of the campaign. There’s not a lot of variety in the missions and the characters are all voiced so badly it’s funny, but they make simple excuses to run over thousands of zombies.  The driving really is the best part of the game, appropriate for a game called Zombie Driver. Your vehicles are different degrees of responsive but all are fast and all make satisfying messes out of the undead. You’ll fight different kinds of zombies including dogs and giant exploders and worse, and they all erupt into fountains of giblets and leave crimson streaks on the pavement. It’s a viscerally satisfying game, even if the sound effects aren’t always up to the task of capturing the slaughter. Weapons do tons of damage and clear out crowds, and you get mounting monetary bonuses for long streaks of carnage. Much like in Carmaggeddon, It’s easy to lose track of mission objectives just because you’re having so much fun roadkilling things.  The HD in the title does indeed mean this is a remaster of a previous Zombie Driver, but with more going for it than just prettier graphics. The campaign is longer, with a full 31 missions and several new bosses to battle. There are new vehicles as well, which can also be used in the game’s Blood Race and Slaughter modes. Blood Race is, again, much like Carmaggeddon where you race against other cars, crushing zombies and blowing up your opponents to progress. Slaughter is you against mounting waves of zombies with its own progression system of weapons and upgrades. You’ll find plenty to keep you busy as long as you enjoy plowing through zombies, and when it’s done this well there’s really no reason not to.
1801	1	a	 Twelve hours of work and I still can't sleep. Damn. Days go on and on. They don't end.  ― Travis Bickle, Taxi Driver (1976)  And still too many zombies to run them over ;)  After 16h (one-time story, all-gold Slaughter mode, all Blood Race tournaments): PROS + immersive (don't know why: :P) + nice graphics and effects + mixed vehicles + Slaughter mode  CONS - average-bad cameras in relation to the game's speed - sometimes really freaking annoying - cut scenes that can't be missed and which also consume missions' time - even if the mission doesn't have a concrete time limit... suprise, countdown continues - main campaign is little too long, because missions are repeated - final boss with regeneration - Blood Race (Race is good, but Eliminator's too chaotic and Endurance... strange mix of time driving and killing zombies) - a few minor bugs     Subjective rate : B- (this game doesn't deserve either the thumb up or thumb down. That's the truth. It's in the middle, but really only for z-fans. Or Carmageddon/GTA1&amp;2 veterans.)
1803	1	a	Good game, easy to pick up and play. Lots of action and variety of weapons. Different modes of play were also fun.
1805	1	a	So far I've only played through a few hours of the story mode so this review relates to that. I'm looking forward to trying race mode later.  I always have a nostalgic hankering for a decent top down driving game but am usually disappointed. Zombie Driver HD however is fantastic fun.. Rich environments much of which you can destroy, engaging story, awesome voice acting (in the best B movie tradition), convincing hoards that can swamp you if you're careless, great explosive visual effects, quality audio and HUGE zombie bodycounts.  While you are required to develop a certain amount of driving skill it should'nt be too frustrating for novices of the top down style. missions can be completed at a slower pace, sticking to the streets but don't worry about leaving the road, the maps are sensibly designed so you don't constantly get stuck on scenery or in dead ends. As you become skilled with the handbrake you'll be pulling donuts and rail gunning through hundreds of bloody undead.  The different vehicles work well and purchaseable upgrades mean you're always tempted to stray from the mission to grab extra cash found around the city.  The atmosphere created in the game is great, weather changes, night time lighting, the army presence, shadows of jet fighters roaring overhead, vehicle getting covered in blood and a constant tension created by time critical mission elements all add the feel of this great little game.  One thing I would like added is the ability to move the camera a little to scan the environment. Playing with an xbox controller this seems untuitively what the second stick should be used for, although it's arguable that you shouldn't be able to see much further than the street you're driving in.  So in my opinion the developers have done a great job of creating a top down driving game set in a zombie apocalypse, if that sounds like something you need, you should probably grab it in a sale like I did, or at full price if you're feeling flush.  FUN.
1807	1	a	Its mindless fun, just go kill stuff. Great to pass time or just play when you dont feel like anything. But I only reccomend it when its like 75% off or more.
1809	1	a	Just drive back and forth until it feels right. When that doesn't happen, go make yourself some french fries and just keep goin until the screaming stops. When you're done with the fries, keep goin until your car is upgraded enough that you no longer slow down when the zombies become to thick. Do not play this game in real life unless you're sure there are zombies out on streets in your city. Apparently the military is too busy to kick some zombie ♥♥♥, so they have enlisted you to run over some zombies using all sorts of zany vehicles with many possible upgrades.     Just remember to keep goin!
1811	1	a	Love this game, its really good to play if your to tired to play a hard game like Fallout3.  Loads of replay value too, i am on my Third playthrough and its still just as fun.
1813	1	a	Wow, this was a deal for $3.00 with all the DLCs. Excellent, solidly well made game, experienced none of the problems other players reported. Tons of fun to play and even good single-player story campaign. I even bought a controller just for this game and now its among my favorites. Great way to release all that road RAGE!
1815	1	a	Zombie Driver HD. well first of all this game is not 3D but its sooo Awesome because its also same like L4D2 or Dead Island but this time its with Cars!, and i have to say This game actually made my day if im feeling a little bored for some reason and yes i Recommend that game to play.    Rating:9/10
1817	1	a	The Story: Basically those lovely Government Scientists have been having some creative fun with their chemistry sets. Causing a lovely accident that has turned the inhabitants of an entire city into shambling aggressive Zombies. Which of course you are asked to kill as many as you can while doing missions for the military.  Game play: What can I say. Its top downish drive shoot and ram to kill zombies, while doing missions. All good ol fun if you like killing zombies.   The Graphics: They are simple and good enough in my view for the game. But for those who are picky and want things looking really like real life then this would probably effect them. But for this game I say its just right.  Controls: Controls are simple nothing to hard to learn. SWAD for movement LMB for shooting and RMB for Nitro. Petty simple there is other combos for the the controls as well as game pad. But I just stuck with the Keyboard n mouse. Still fun with them.  The Music: It does go nice with the game. It even had the feel of some older games, the names escape me at this point though. It certainly fits the style of game.  The Reply Value: With the other game styles you can get and the dlc. There is some reply value in it. Plus am sure the any zombie killing lover will reply it a lot.  Bugs/Glitches: I could not see any bugs or glitches that could effect my game play of this game. But remember that's not saying that they might pop up for others. But for me none what so ever.  Overall: Its a fun zombie killing game, with some nice graphics that suit the game. Easy to use controls, music that go's with the game in my view. Certainly has reply for those zombie killing lovers. No bugs or glitches that I can see. Story was to me generic, but that's me. So in my view this is a nice game to play. So I give it a 7 out of 10.
1819	1	a	So this game is hella fun...People still say 'hella,' right? Anyways, more important than the entertainment to be had, in my opinion, is its value to achievement junkies. If you're anything like me and have difficulty getting it up for games that don't have a nice fat achievements, this game will be your mistress. I beleive this is the only game I've gotten 100% on, but I havn't been hunting on PC long, as I believed Steam lacked incentive to obtain achievements. I recently discovered the achievement percentage, and mine was 22%. Pathetic. Figured I'd start bumping it up by playing the bottom game in my library, and beleive me, my child, I picked the right one.   
1821	1	a	Zombie cats, dogs,humans, fat people, plants, buses, shipping containers, Mounds, and  the Father of all Zombies! and we get to mow most of them down with that beautiful front bumper and KILL THE REST WITH GUNS!!!!! got game + all DLC for $3 totally worth it.
1823	1	a	[NOTE: All of my reviews are based off of value for money/comaparison to price. I purchased 'Zombie Driver HD' for 69p with a 90% off voucher.]  To start. This is one of those fun little games that you would play when you don't have enough time to play a missoin on a bigger game but want to play something. (Damn those poorly timed meetings.)  Story: A zombie acopalypse strikes. You are a taxi driver in a large city who is saved by the army. However, the army is limited and you are needed to assist in rescue efforts and clearing zombies out of certain areas. You car can be outfitted with various weapons and armour types. You can unlock new vehicles by completing secondary mission objectives.   Gameplay:  There are powerups/healthkits/weapons that you can collect around the map in a mission to make it a bit easier. You can Run over, Burn, Shoot and Blow up as many zombis as you can. There are also minigames such as races and wave survival. It is fun to play for those timess you are bored and want to play a full campaign.
1825	1	a	This game is an outright blast! Nothing beats using a car to mow down some zombies in a very well-detailed world. You can play in story mode, Blood Race and of course slaughter mode for some quick &amp; awesome zombie killing. Well worth a buy for some casual play and it even utilizes nVidia's PhysX.
1827	1	a	Great Story, but repeats it's missions pretty fast. Many Vehicles, extremely huge masses of Zombies and nice weapons for every situation.   Also a great Race Gamemode with destroying the other racers and a Arena-Survival Gamemode where you can try to survive. (Obvious, isn't it? xD)  I recommend this game for friends of Racers that like to drive over zombies in a bird's eye view.
1829	1	a	You can hit a building at full speed and take no damage... You can destroy other cars with ease and take no damage... You can destroy fences, street lights, cactuses/trees and take no damage...  But you can take damage when a zombie throws trash at you...
1831	1	a	Stupid amounts of fun, highly recommended!
1833	1	a	For the cheap price of this game and the level of fun you'll have, you might be quite surprised when you play Zombie Driver. Its basically what you might expect in terms of its name but just the realism and fun you can have with the vehicles alone is great mix. Along with a few interesting extra mini-games to keep you going. The game has alot of heart to it and the overall control of the vehicles is based upon the vehicle itself or how you read the city and not from bad game mechanics. You might lose a few times in some levels, but the overall result of this game definitely made you feel like a total badass zombie killer. And isn't that what we all want? ^O^
1835	1	a	Got this on sale along with all DLC. Easily one of the most fun games I have played. Well woth the price. Would love to see even more content or possibly a sequel.
1837	1	a	I'm not the world's biggest fan of driving games. And surely I'm not the only die-hard horror fan who has to started to grow weary of zombies. But this game is actually fairly awesome.    Beautiful graphics, logical maps and understandable physics. What more can one ask for in a game where the objective is to drive over and gun down hordes of zombies in heavily-accessorised cars? If there's a better zombie-driving game out there, I'd sure like to see it. Good, unclean fun.  Verdict: 9/10.
1839	1	a	I actually really like this one. Not sure if there's anything bad to say about it. It's not your Triple-A title with a rich plot and surprisingly innovative gameplay but I don't think that it intends to be that. If you want to let off steam, this is it. Kinda like Nation Red, only in a car.  Quality is also very good, visually and technically. Oh, and good controller support; playing it with a Xbox 360 controller.  One of the few games I like to get back to now and then and still enjoy it. Recommended.
1841	1	a	  Blood, cars, guns, cars with guns, explosions and, of course, zombies! What' not to like about this game. It has a decent campaign (4-5 hours), although it is kind of repetetive (no more than 5 type of missions), but every single one is satisfying.  The weapons feel great, the driving feels good and the camera may make you dizzy at first by there are 3 more option to change to.  *You have to play the game with a gamepad. The keypord controls are very clanky. Apart from the campaign there are to more mods to play, racing with others through zombies, and surviving waves of zombies. To sum up, fun game, worths the money, use gamepad.
1843	1	a	I love this game, the blood mode racing is pretty hard, but the story made is really fun.
1845	1	a	It's okay. Repetitive and the end missions are stupidly unforgiving though.  It's fun for a while, at least. One to pick up when it's cheap.
1847	1	a	Very entertaining game. Has 3 game modes and multiple vehicles. Story mode has 31 missions and they are kinda short. Race mode is a little difficult on my opinion, but fun as well. Slaughter mode is great but a little exhausting. The gold score is high and you get points very slowly. But you get used to it and actually don't even pay attention to the score while playing. Really enjoyable. Better than I expected. Great addition to my library.
1849	1	a	7.5/10 What an awesome little game. Easy in, easy out... I enjoy little bursts of this while waiting for friends to come online to play + I only paid .99c for it. Supper Value!
1851	1	a	I didn't know this game existed until I received a coupon for it, then I found out how addictive it was to run zombies down in a yellow cab. This game is awesome, if a bit buggy at times, and is definitely worth a look.
1853	1	a	What's more fun than killing zombies?  Running them over with a nitro boosted bus that has a flamethrower.   9.999999/10 Would flamethrow again. 
1855	1	a	it's alright.
1857	1	a	mmm i love this meat delicious zombie racing game. it gets you entertained and never makes you feel embarassed/annoyed. graphics are really good, i don't see any problem with the camera look, it makes fun in gameplay. plot is standard. basically it's a nice game to relax/chill. you won't regret ;)

1861	1	a	Zombie Driver is a damn good game, but if you read my recommendation for the original version, you knew that already. This HD version adds some choice features like rechargable turbo, boss fights, an extended story mode, and a guest appearance by the van from L4D's Crash Course campaign. It's a classic top-down driving game in the vein of Death Rally or the original Grand Theft Auto, with plenty of fast action, violence and fun to spare. It's a simple pleasure with no multiplayer, but it's got a triple combo of story missions, races and survival modes. If you didn't play the original game, then this is the version to get. So strap in and gun that engine, those zombies aren't going to splat themselves.
1863	1	a	7.5/10 What an awesome little game. Easy in, easy out... I enjoy little bursts of this while waiting for friends to come online to play + I only paid .99c for it. Supper Value!
1865	1	a	Really fun game driving round killing zombies in a kitted out killing machine of a car, good if you just want to play something fun for a while to pass time, after a while gets abit repetitive but its good as a time waster.
1867	1	a	All I can say about this jewel is ''OH MY GOD IT'S FUN''. Basically it's a bird's eye view zombie shoot/ram/blow up game that will fill your heart with joy and sometimes frustrate the hell out of ya. Gameplay is excellent and so are the graphics and sound effects. Variety of game modes, customizable vehicles and weaponry will keep you busy for hours.  So get out and ram some zombie arses :)  cheers
1869	1	a	Apogees Duke Nukem Death Rally meets Rockstars Classic Grand Theft Auto. Top down car driving gun blazing zombie killing goodness.  Played the original a what seem like 6 ish years ago ?, and to be honest didn't give it much thought, it was ok but found it fiddly with a keyboard and mouse. Skip forward to 2015 and I picked up the ZD HD complete pack for just over £2 and have been playing it nearly 5 days now, this time however with an xbox controller.  In short the game visualy looks very nice, easily some of the best 'indie' game graphics available even against 2014/15 offerings. SFX compliment the game well nice solid sounding guns and squishy zombie splatter under the tires. Heavy Metal BGM during the survival mini games gets your adrenalin pumping but is less suited perhaps to the missions of the main game, it is good but can become repetative. Voice acting ... well at least there is some, lets just say it doesnt add nor detract from the game, and I've defo heard a lot lot worse.   Game can be tricky to control with kyb and mouse and is definatly easier to be prescise with a stick controller like xbox/ps3 controller.  Main game offers 31 missions each taking between 3-10 mins to complete on your first play through, each with highscore tables and secondary optional missions offering limited replay value but atleast it has. These can be replayed in any order, using any car you have unlocked with ay upgrades you have unlocked making a replay easier to obtain a better score or to do secondary missions.  Survival mode offers erm.... 7 ish arena maps with the aim to survive as long as possible with waves or increasing numbers and toughness of mobs, earning upgrades each wave to assist you and random weapon and bonus score drops. each map having its own high score tables. This is easily the most fun mode and will keep you playing for significant time after having completed the main game. To be fair some of these maps can feel a little small or tight to move around and can feel like you are just driving in a circle, but most are nice arenas with multiple paths to manouvre around.  Race mode, this is somewhat similar to a classic game Death Rally from the 90s, I havent played much of this so far but is a series of tournaments made up of a set number of events, such as race, checkpoint and elimination. This can be a little frustrating as it is very easy to get stitched up right at the end of an event after leading 95% of a race. This mode seems to be 75% player skill and 25% luck.  Money spent on car and weapon upgrades from the main game are for the main game only, in the main game new cars are unlocked through playthrough. In survival upgrades are earned in each game for that game only by completing waves cars are unlocked in this mode by unlocking them in the main game. In race mode cars have to be unlocked with money, money earned and spent on cars and upgrades in race mode is for race mode only.   I can not comment of the race mode achievements, however achievements for the main game are not difficult to obtain. There is one that you should be aware of before starting your first playthrough which if missed will require a full 2nd replay.... which is probably best as it will be easier with some experience having played the game, and one that will require a little skill and luck and several play throughs requiring to complete last mission with less than 10% health. The survial achievements are easily obtainable and fun to boot. With my limited time spent of race mode, I do not think they will be too hard just frustrating needing several replays that will take time, depending on skill or rather luck.  Perhaps the best thing about ZD HD is whether you have 5 mins to play a game or 4 hours, it will keep you entertained and survival mode will always suck you in for just one more try.  If your paying full price just pickup the main game and the Apocalypse pack well worth the money. If its on sale then buy the complete edition, either way this game is easily a must buy for your collection.   ***EDIT***  Just a quick note, system specs are i7 4500HQ, 16gb, R9 265x and game runs fine at max settings 1080p, a little slowdown ( just dips below 30fps ) at points in a couple of the later missions, no slow down on survival or race modes. Accidently run with onboard 4600HD for the first couple of missions and would be fair to say it handled max settings well around 28-38 fps but would be fair to say later missions would pose a problem given the 265x diped below 30 at times, should be ok on HD or HD+ however with 4600HD.
1871	1	a	This game is the biggest example why graphics isnt everthing.
1873	1	a	Probably the best $2 I've ever spent on the world wide web. Who doesn't enjoy hood mounted death machines on a taxi? I for one enjoy very much what I recently spoke of.  I award this game 8 rum and colas out of 10.
1875	1	a	I bought this game way back before it was on steam and enjoyed it. Was pleasently surprised to see it on sale recently and decided to buy it, even though I have the original version of the game. Well worth the purchase. Graphics are updated, as well as parts of the story and gameplay. You drive around running over and shooting zombies. What else do you need? Great for killing time when you don't feel like playing a big in-depth game. Worth the couple of bucks I paid for the complete edition.
1877	1	a	Wow. For a quick action fix heavy on the mayhem you need look no further than ZD HD. Sooo much better than the original. Easy to pick up, hard to master but pure fun all the way. This game is worth it, especially if you can grab it on sale. Works great with a controller. Story mode, race mode, and slaughter mode and a lot of achievements make this a versatile and fun action game. Whether you play for 5 minutes or 5 hours, you will enjoy this one.
1879	1	a	The title of this game basically tells you all you need to know about the gameplay: run over zombies with your selected vehicle. You run over zombies or kill them with weapons attached to the vehicle while completing primary and secondary objectives in the story mode.  The story mode has a basic plot that is very typical for zombie based games, not ground breaking. It looks like another apocalypse. Your mission begins with a briefing from General Blofeld that you must clear out an area filled with zombies or rescue certain people who are being overwhelmed by zombies. As you go about your mission, you run over zombies while your vehicle gets covered in blood and earn combo bonuses. These combo bonuses continue to multiply if you continue to mow down zombies in a bloody mess, something like chaining your matches in Audiosurf. The top-down perspective looks like the first 2 Grand Theft Auto games and the action looks like the Carmageddon series since you are constantly causing a bloody good time around town.  The weapons are scattered around town and all are pretty useful. They include flamethrowers, machine guns, railguns, rocket launchers, and nitro. All weapons can be upgraded using the cash you earn from each mission completed. The nitro really speeds up your car and helps you reach your destination faster, but it is also useful in getting out of a tight situation when being overwhelmed by large numbers of pedestrians that could potentially make your car explode.  Vehicles are varied and range from taxis to buses. Some vehicles are more useful than others in some missions. The military may ask you to rescue 8 people in a given mission, so the best vehicle could be the bus because it has a carrying capacity of 48 people. All vehicles can be upgraded for more speed and better ramming ability. Even with the variety of weapons at your disposal, ramming zombies with power slides and using nitro to go full speed ahead is still more common than shooting.  The zombies range from regular zombies to exploding zombies. The regular zombies are small or medium in size and there are many zombie dogs run over. The real challenge comes in the form of exploding zombies. Exploding zombies are the fat zombies who can detonate themselves when they get near your vehicle. You can be earning great combos while killing 300+ zombies, only to be ruined by a group of 3-4 exploding zombies who commit suicide next to your vehicle, causing it to explode.  There are a few bosses to battle in the game. These bosses can only be defeated with enough firepower using the various weapons in town. It is also necessary to use defense by running away from them when they are ready to attack. A lack of defensive moves will lead to certain death. In addition, the zombies will never leave you alone during boss battles. So, while you are running away to restock ammo the zombies are chasing you. When you are firing away at the bosses the zombies are still attacking you.  There are other modes in the game that add to the zombie splattering fun. There is the blood race mode and the slaughter mode. The blood race mode is about tournaments that require you to compete in different events such as races, eliminator, and endurance and have bronze, silver, and gold medals available. Races require you to finish 1st for gold and you can destroy vehicles by ramming them or with your weapons. Eliminator events require you to cause as many wrecks as possible while going through checkpoints to increase the time remaining. Endurance events require you to drive around with a bomb stuck to your vehicle going through checkpoints to increase the time remaining. The trick in Endurance events is to kill zombies and destroy as many objects as possible to contribute to the time remaining. The slaughter mode is a good old fashioned zombie killing, splattering entertainment. It is all about killing as many zombies as possible from one wave to the next until your vehicle explodes.  The graphics are decent and, while not dazzling, they provide a well-detailed environment. The death animations look cool and make you feel like it is so much fun making your vehicle all red in blood and guts. You can hear the zombies writhe in pain very loudly when you splatter them all over your vehicle or when you blow them away with your weapons.  The vehicles handle well, as the physics feel realistic during the times you have to turn and perform power slides. They also feel realistic according to the type of vehicle. The muscle car feels very fast whereas the bus feels slow, but very powerful for ramming zombies. The super car feels like it is both fast and powerful since it combines all the great attributes of speed and power.  Some may be disappointed by the fact the Zombie Driver HD has no multiplayer. True, there is more replay value after playing the story mode because of the blood race and slaughter modes. However, those who love multiplayer action will not have any opportunity to compete in multiplayer mode.  I think Zombie Driver HD is a lot of fun to play. The story mode feels a little bit short in length, but it is still entertaining enough. The blood race and slaughter modes provide more entertainment and replay value for a low price of $9.99. All the zombie crushing and splattering fun makes this game worth your purchase.  My Score: 7.5/10 
1881	1	a	Once you get past the touchy controls, you'll enjoy.
1883	1	a	This game reminds me of Death Rally. If you enjoy top down zombie killing, worth the pickup. Story mode was not overly long, but I could see me coming back to replay this for a 'quick fix'
1885	1	a	It's actually not a bad game at all. It's very fun and addicting. It would be good if the game had a free roam in it. I love the blood in the game :D. Got it for 0.70€ using a coupon :D :P
1887	1	a	Nothing innovative, nothing impressive, but it managed to give me the thrill and excitement of driving around a decently rendered city in a badass vehicle and killing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s of zombies while doing it, for me, that's simply enough.
1889	1	a	Very addictive,I recommend you to play it!
1891	1	a	This is bloody and fun. =) Everything I gonna say is in the demo so yeah, play it. =) It's fun.
1893	1	a	A wild crazy zombie game, for the fans of gta 1 &amp; 2 who want to run over every pedestrian without feeling guilty...after all, they are zombies! great guns and modes too
1895	1	a	Only get this game if you have a gamepad game has keyboard controls but it's not precise enough in my opinion. also of note is that keyboard controls can't be configured although I worked around it by using autohotkey.  recommended because I can't say I'm not recommending it with the very little I played (yes I'm missing a gamepad)
1897	1	a	Ive finished the main story now. Almost a good game... Some fun, but the Cut Scenes are the MOST ANNOYING I have EVER seen. You cant skip them, even when repeating a mission. I cant believe that they would put such a stupid restriction on the game (and from what I have heard, they WILL NOT change it, despite many complaints). They are TERRIBLE. The voice acting is poor (it comes across as cheesy / fun the first time or two), and the cut scenes ruin the pace of the game. Not to mention the stupid difficulty changes in each mission. And Im SICK AND TIRED of every ♥♥♥♥ing mission being timed in one way or another. Create a game that is potentially fun, then not allow you to actually enjoy it (except in other game modes maybe). Would have gotten an 8/10, but I have to give it a 6... it does its best to ruin the long term (replayable) enjoyment of the game.
1899	1	a	A very fun game. Works best with a x-box controller.
1901	1	a	Total.♥♥♥♥ing.Mayhem.

1907	1	a	A very fun game. Works best with a x-box controller.
1909	1	a	Need for Speed + Carmageddon + Left 4 Dead = Zombie Driver It took only 20 hours to get all steam achievements for this game!
1911	1	a	Great game for carnage fun.
1913	1	a	Controller highly recommended!! While the storymode gets a bit repetative, the extras like slaughtermode and the tournaments really make this game fun to play from time to time. The gameplay is pretty much everything you see in the trailer, with a boss here and there.
1915	1	a	Fun game and a perfect choice for achievement hunters
1917	1	a	Great arcade game. It has different game modes and a good amount of unlockables. It doesn't become boring, even after hours and hours of gameplay.
1919	1	a	Fun game, worth my 3 bucks, killing zombie is fun
1921	1	a	Play the game while listening to Highway to Hell.
1923	1	a	great game. it is with cars and zombies :)
1925	1	a	Lots a fun.Crushing zombies left and right
1927	1	a	Very lucky get it in promotion price very nice to play, challenging and recommended to play.
1929	1	a	I love this game its almost the zombie shooting and lot of costomozition and differents game mod
1931	1	a	Fantastic little game :') played the original.
1933	1	a	If you hate Zombies, then yes get this game !  7/10 would stay in my car, during the apocalypse - IGN
1935	1	a	Have player through the campaign. My review is: Absolutely fantastic!!!! 10 out of 10 as a platformer. Addicting gameplay, good graphics, great variety of missions and adversaries. I could not wish for more. This game is simply a must buy for everyone who likes zombies and racing.
1937	1	a	Very under rated and deserves more buy's only 20mins in but its already hell fun
1939	1	a	Zombie Driver HD is a good for game for people who wants to save people and the world.  Recommend.
1941	1	a	Maul zombies with cars. What more could you want?
1943	1	a	Nice game
1945	1	a	A fun combo of a driving and zombie game.
1947	1	a	This game... IS AWESOME!
1949	1	a	CRAZY !! BRVTAL  GORY !!  Imagine  Dead Rising Series + Carmageddon + Dota  yeah  DIS GAME  
1951	1	a	Definitely worth the money. Very fun game. Love killing zombies.
1953	1	a	It was fun for 30 minutes.
1955	1	a	Love this game! Its the kind of game you can go too after getting too stressed out on another OR just dont know what to play!  11/10 for me!
1957	1	a	Awesome game. Works great with controlers.
1959	1	a	Simple mindless fun.  Just drive around and mow down zombies.  Car mechanics are well made and fun. Objectives are decent enough. Not much to the game but does it well enough for the price.  Figured i needed a game like this for when the mood stikes, would recommend for others in need of a top down arcade game like this.  
1961	1	a	Game have really good graphic &amp; music, is really funny to play (boosters etc..) really good, 8.5/10 ;)
1963	1	a	This game is actually quite a good title, i find the gameplay is quite enjoyable and mostly it's challenging.
1965	1	a	This game is crazy fun. I got for $1.00 with my rank ups and I have to say it is very well done. If you like running over Zombies in that old format similar to the original Grand Theft Auto, Why not Zombie Driver? It's got a ton of features including updgrades for your vehicle and weapons. Give a shot.
1967	1	a	Fantastic improvements over the original game; day/night cycle, weather system, longer campaign and missions, new weapons, new mobs + bosses and new awesome vehicles like the tank (which kicks ♥♥♥ ofc) and the firesquad car... If you liked the first game, this is definitely a must buy and even if you never heard of the original, still is a must buy (cheap @ IG for 1$ atm)
1969	1	a	An honest brutal title to this game that you can't help but admire, The game that wastes time deliverying or experimenting with some new turn on dispatching contemporary gaming's most overuse ememies, It's basically just you and your car on a familar birdseye view format nostalgia on the early years of Grand theft Auto and the whole population full of zombies and some surviours in the whole state. Over the course of the game you smash through them causing a lot of destruction with weapons and choses of cars and school buses, fry them with flame throwers and rocket launchers and leveling up as you proceed further in the game. The game itself is quiet imaginative and creative all around, it's stupid and unrealistic, gory and quiet fun.
1971	1	a	great graphics, hard as hell, can make you dizzy if ya got bad sinuses..lol Nice upgrades, overall pretty nice little game.
1973	1	a	Fun Game but i recommend using a game controller, just to hard to steer with the keyboard
1975	1	a	So I got this game because I got a coupon for 50% off and thought why the hell not. It's been a pretty fun game so far but I have to say the gameplay is not that versatile. The missions u have to do are pretty much the same the entire time. You either have to pick up some survivors or destroy some zombie nest. And at times it feels more like your just focussing on collecting health and ammunition for most parts of the mission. The game on the other hand reminds me a bit of the very first GTA, and who doesnt like a bit of nostalgia.
1977	1	a	amusing zombie game, driving the car over the bodies feels like the old days playing GTA3. the animations are pretty similar.  the story mode is fine, there is also an arena and racing mode, many different perks, weapons and unlockable cars.  enough enemy types and simple controls round the package.  only bad points are the low quality sound and that its singleplayer only.  all together its sure worth the 8,99€ and fun if you like crunching some zombies!
1979	1	a	wow its good game I'm Like
1981	1	a	One of the best Zombie massacring games EVER!
1983	1	a	If you like killing the undead with cars that has gun on the hood, YOU! will love the shooting cobo, you will love Zombie Driver HD
1985	1	a	top down zombie slaying at its best!
1987	1	a	A good fun game. Lots of mission.
1989	1	a	++
1991	1	a	This game perfectly blends old school top down GTA with brutal mass zombie slaughter. You drive cars equipped with machine guns, flame throwers, rockets, shock weapons nitro boosts and more. There are plenty of weapons, vehicles and game modes to choose from. The great thing is that for those that grew up with GTA 1 and 2 on the playstation 1 there actually is a 'retro camera' mode where the free camera will fix itself just as the good old days.  The game is only 10€ and when on sale it goes down to 3€ INCLUDING all the DLC. This game is dirt cheap even at 10€. The story mode is well thought out, voiced, filled with multiple giant maps and a wide variety of different missions. On top of the pretty extensive story mode there are a ton of challenges, zombie killing combo modes and even races! The death races are crazy fun and brutally hard and those alone will keep you busy for quite a while. What's even more incredible is that for that small price tag, you don't only get a game jam packed with content, it actually looks really damn good too! Better than most more expensive games.  It's seriouslt almost a crime not to pick this up, especially when you are running into it when it's on sale.
1993	1	a	If you like to run over zombies with vehicles, get this game :D
1995	1	a	I only got this game because it was on sale and i wish i had bought it earlier. All i can say is that this game is a blast! Who does not love driving around in fast cars mowing down zombies with gun, flamethrowers, missiles and lasers? The story is amazing and has a ton of levels. And if you get bored of that there is the racing and slaughter mode to top it all off! Hours of fun and a game you can come back to when you get a bit bored. Would recommend to all gamers out there! - 10/10
1997	1	a	Story is good, Blood Race is good, Slaughter is good. 3 Modes, whole lot o' zombies.
1999	1	a	Zombie Driver HD's relatively low price point and reasonable replay value make it easy to recommend, so long as you aren't expecting something of full retail quality.
2001	1	a	I wouldn't say I'm a big fan of this game but.... seeing as I have the original 'retail' version a couple of times, I guess I must be.           YouTube™ Video:  ➜ A Quick Look @ 'Zombie Driver HD'&nbsp;
2003	1	a	Game of the year, every year.
2005	1	a	blood and zombies 11/10
2007	1	a	it scary
2009	1	a	Rating: 7 out of 10  Genre: Driving Shooter / Zombie Killing  Thoughts:
2011	1	a	Very good taxi driving simulator.
2013	1	a	Kill them all!!!
2015	1	a	cars, zombies and weapons!
2017	1	a	Best game ever played, simple, efficient, most basic game but the feeling is so ....
2019	1	a	This game is good with action-packed fun!
2021	1	a	Buy this if you like puzzle game.
2023	1	a	very funy when driver over car in the city of zombie
2025	1	a	Really fun to play in short burts
2027	1	a	It's really funny and good to relieve one's boredom.
2029	1	a	Great game not that pure great but still great  Nice Graphics Great SoundTrack ...  the thing is that this game is not that easy . its fun to play but that easy.  In general way speaking ,its a pure blast ,if you are looking for something that has a top view arcade style game
2031	1	a	A mindless zombie killing game. Best described as lizard brain porn (you don't need to conciously think about it, but it still is pleasing).
2033	1	a	Great game for a cheap price
2035	1	a	this game is surprisingly good, i like it. the camera is a bit iffy, but a good game overall
2037	1	a	Kill kill the zombie !! A nice drive-in game.
2039	1	a	This is a very addictive game, buy it play it. You won't be sorry!
2041	1	a	Really Nice
2043	1	a	Its different from other Zombie games for sure but the camera controls are a bit akward but stil fun at times as long as you dont completa a mission and get killed on the way back to the base.
2045	1	a	It's cool and imersive. I recomend it, i just have a bit of troubble controlling the vehicles. Could be me or my hardware wish i could try a game pad on my PC. perhaps that would solve the controlling isue. Graphics are great and the game is challenging. Like the upgrades available for vehicles. Unlocking some, are fun! :D
2047	1	a	it is a great game, i recommend. every missions is diferent and i don't geat bored of playing this game.
2049	1	a	Mindless zombie fun but it eventually gets repetitive.
2051	1	a	Nothing like some Zombi guts all over you car.
2053	1	a	cars, zombies, weapons, driving, replay value. nuff said
2055	1	a	 Bottom line:  An enjoyable and attractive, if somewhat frustrating, top-down driving game in the vein of the original GTA games. Has less complex missions, however spices things up with seriously large hordes of zombies to brutalise with heavy weapons!   Pros:    Video and audio are generally pleasing. The maps and vehicles have a lot of gritty detail and weather and lighting effects are put to good use. The particle and gore effects are suitably over-the-top and make firing rockets into zombie mobs a very satisfying experience.   Multiple game modes provide a great amount of content for the price and also offer a variety of experiences. This is a good thing, because the story missions generally feel much the same. In particular, I found the Slaughter mode (arena) to be challenging and required both tactical and strategic thinking to reach round 20 and beyond. Racing includes a variety of different events, in which the aim is either racing, destroying opponents, or driving as far as possible with a bomb attached to your car! Sadly, I found all modes spoiled more often that not by the difficulty in identifying 'hard' obstacles and the unpredictable handling of the vehicles during collisions.   Weapon variety is decent and effective, but fairly uninspired. Power-ups are all incremental improvements until the last level, where power is doubled. Specialisation usually plays second fiddle to whatever happens to be lying around your general vicinity at the time.   No crashes in the ten or so hours spent in game (Windows 8).    Cons:    Unpredictable behaviour when hitting walls and other obstructions; sometimes you bounce, sometimes you stop dead, sometimes you instantly spin 180 degrees. A little frustrating in the main game, immensely frustrating in the race events! Came close to rage quitting a few times in this mode... Apart from this, the controls are fine (used M&amp;KB).   What 'story' there is remains utterly predictable throughout and voice acting is excruciating. I am sure its tongue in cheek, but its still horrible.   Performance drops and wavers noticeably once there are a  lot  of zombies on the screen. This is mainly an issue in arena mode, where huge hordes are a common occurence. This is on an i5 3570K with an AMD 6950.     DLC:    Mostly forgettable...   The included vehicles are overpowered and spoil the progression of the story mode a little.   If you are still looking for more of the same  after  completing the game, you won't be disappointed with the additional race and arena maps. If you are expecting something different, don't bother.  
2057	1	a	I played this expecting it to be a terrible waste of time. I am actually having a great time playing it. A great way to waste 30-45 minute time periods in between my Counter Strike matches. 8/10.
2059	1	a	Remember the first episode of the walking dead, where rick climbs in the tank, but doesn't use it to clear the walkers out?, well, this game has a level just for you. go forth, in a tank, and blow zombie guts all over the sides of skyscrapers.
2061	1	a	Rating: 7/10  A very fun, addictive game. It seems that driving over thousands of zombies and watching them splatter with full blood and gore effects never gets old! This game offers you just that. The gameplay is the core of this game, as all you get to do is kill zombies (Thousands of them), save survivors and cause mayhem. It's fairly arcade-like, so it's fun for a few minutes at a time. The graphics are not that great, but the game makes you look over it with the amount of blood and gore it throws at you on the screen. It pretty much is a top-down version of Carmageddon, so if you have played the old classic, you're gonna love this. For owners of the old Zombie Driver, this game is some what of a rip off as it doesn't offer you much in comparison - But at a nice discount it's well worth it.
2063	1	a	I Picked this game up on sale.  Lots of fun and works nicely with my xbox controller! I enjoyed playing it when I'm board of all my more time demanding games.  I recommend this it for its price and entertainment level it well worth the buy! 
2065	1	a	Reminds me of GTA 1. That's a good thing. Good controller support. Fun, totally mindless. Worth the voucher price, easy.
2067	1	a	Haha, epic fun. Don't expect anything too expansive though, comparable to web games
2069	1	a	Buy it and the DLC. Discounted at $2 is an amazing buy if you love tricking out post-apocalyptic cars to kill zombies.
2071	1	a	Good game! UPG racing ... alot of dead people there, survival mode and story mode.   Rate: 8.4
2073	1	a	Zombies flood the streets and the city's last hope is apparently someone in a taxi cab.. It's stupidly fun and there's blood splatter everywhere, especially when you mow down hoards of zombies with your vehicle. The view is an overhead topdown kind of view so the camera can be a bit awkward sometimes if you back up too close to a building. The voice acting in this game is also hilariously bad but considering this game doesn't seem to take itself too seriously I'll let that slide. If you like the idea of clearing the streets with a flamethrower equipped limo then this is your game!
2075	1	a	This is a very fun and addicting game with a fairly decent story. Do not play this game how ever for the story alone as you will be extremly disappointed. This game is best if you are wanting a kill them all driving game.
2077	1	a	seems like a pretty cool driving/zed killing game.
2079	1	a	Simple yet addictive guilty pleasure, Worth the 10 bucks (5 if you own the non HD version).
2081	1	a	A simple and fast/brutal action game. You may take some time to get used to the in-game camera but its lot of fun garanted. The DlC´s bring some variation on skins mostly and some cars and the Blood Race is the most fun game mode to me. Take it !
2083	1	a	cool game go kill the zombies !
2085	1	a	If you're in the mood for some mindless slaughter of zombies, then this game is totally for you! Though I would definitely recommend having a controller for it, makes the game much more enjoyable.
2087	1	a	Beautiful Game , Insane mix of cars, speed, explosions, blood and zombies!
2089	1	a	I don't like zombie games and really can't remember why I bought this. You can choose between survival, racing or story mode.  Unlock cars and upgrades for those. You can pick up weapon mods like miniguns, rockets, flamethrower or a railgun. Partly destructible environment like picket fences, streetlights and parking cars.  Get mission rewards and achievements depending on your performance. Over hundred achievements and a six card set. 7/ 10  
2091	1	a	Honestly, this game is not great but its not bad either. If you just want some mindless top down driver combined with zombies, go for it. It will get tedious over time so I ended up playing a few missions and then coming back to it months later. There are a few different game modes: story, races, etc. each of them are quite good but you will find yourself playing a few hours and getting fed up.
2093	1	a	The closest remake of Blast Corps I've seen yet.
2095	1	a	Fun arcade style shoot 'em up game. Better with a controler IMO as the controls can be kinda twitchy with a KB/Mouse setup. Very fun romp.
2097	1	a	Such a simple game and idea yet had rediculous amounts of fun playing this game. You can rack up hours playing this and not notice the time go by. I think it will be a game compared to marmite but I love marmite and loved this! Must have in your library.
2099	1	a	HD means HD graphics but it could call Zombie Driver 2. It have a whole new champaign, with new missions, and wehicles. New wehicles like tank and dozer are fun. If you like Zombie Driver or Zombie games, you must try it.  _____________________________________________________  A HD helyett akár Zombie Driver 2 is lehetne a cime, egy egészen új hadjárat van benne új missziókkal és új jármüvekkel. Ilyen jármü pl a tank és dózer amikkel igazán nagy móka apritani a zombikat. Ha szereted a zombie drivert vagy a zombis játékokat akkor ezt is ki kell próbálnod!
2101	1	a	Buy it it´s fun.
2103	1	a	Fun remake of Zombie Driver and more stuff and vehicles to play and more achievements great game :)!
2105	1	a	Are you looking for a casual game which can help you blow of some steam? You should buy this game. Do you like running over and shooting zombies with armored cars? You should buy this game. Is Zombie Driver Hd on sale? You should definitely buy this game.  This game offers hours of gameplay and satisfying content.
2107	1	a	Had a 90% off coupon, so I got the game for $1. Man....what an entertaining $1. I don't even like the whole zombie genre of games. But this somehow managed to keep my attention for 3-4 days till I beat it. The voice overs are hilariously bad, which adds a little humor to this simplistic drive-around-kill-everything game . The game itself is simple and pretty long if you take your time. Really kinda suprised I liked it....Try it
2109	1	a	Zombie Driver HD is a vehicle combat game that places you in a post-zombie apocalyptic city where it’s just you, the road and a bloody mess of zombie bodies. Outfit your car with machine guns, flame throwers and missile launchers and match the style of fun and gameplay with the likes of Twisted Metal and Death Race for the NES. Getting tired of killing zombies with a gun? How about using a car? It is as much fun as it sounds and a nice addition to a genre that doesn’t get as much love as it once did.   http://iamericm.com/2014/03/zombie-driver-hd-indie-game-review/ 
2111	1	a	Great game, highly recommended!
2113	1	a	This is an awesome game i love it and hope you all buy it get it so awesome thanks so much makers of it wish i had the money to buy it right now but thanks to family share i can play it thank you so much
2115	1	a	Now in HD!!! A simple and fun zombie game. It offers cool upgrades for your vehicles so you might start with an ordinary run-of-the-mill taxi, but you will end with a zombie-splattering-engine-of-doom! Best part is, it's a low price and easy to run!
2117	1	a	run and kill zombies! simple and easy game +1
2119	1	a	this is the love child of Carmageddon and Grand Theft Auto
2121	1	a	 Bottom line:  An enjoyable and attractive, if somewhat frustrating, top-down driving game in the vein of the original GTA games.

2123	1	a	Not bad game but the trading cards have horribly price.
2125	1	a	It's worth the price if it's on sale. I just came back to this game to review it and saw it's on sale for 2.50, so that's a good price. The full 10.00 is a bit high though. Actual multiplayer races would've been fantastic. The dialogue makes me think it was written in another language and translated back to English. Mechanics and the game itself were fun though. I liked the tropical map, in fact, the graphics overall were wonderful! Some levels felt like they were designed to punish you for even trying to beat the challenges set up for you. But you know what? I had fun and I think it's worth it- on sale that is. The assets were well done and woven together, but the story was a mess... my review is as messy as the experience I had.
2127	1	a	buy this game cause its good.
2129	1	a	cars, zombies, weapons, driving, replay value. nuff said
2131	1	a	Didn't expect this game to be fun at all, turns out I was completely wrong. This game is a nice small type of indie where you can upgrade your ride as you smash and kill zombies while completing missions
2133	1	a	WE NEED MORE CARS AND MISSIONS ONLINE GAMEMODES MORE MISSIONS AND SIDE MISSIONS AND MORE PAINT JOBS AND MORE BOSSES AND ZOMBE CLASS MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORE
2135	1	a	Can't stop playing. Worth more than what I paid for.
2137	1	a	Cool enough to keep you busy when you need some blood
2139	1	a	Very good arcade game with oldschool feel that brings hours of fun. I especially liked destruction derby style races.
2141	1	a	It's cool and imersive. I recomend it, i just have a bit of troubble controlling the vehicles. Could be me or my hardware wish i could try a game pad on my PC. perhaps that would solve the controlling isue. Graphics are great and the game is challenging.

2145	1	a	Two bucks well spent! Zombie Driver HD is a fun little game to kill some time.
2147	1	a	A lot of surprising fun. Extremely satisfying to destroy loads of zombies by running over them, shooting them, burning them, blowing them up or doing two or three of those things at the same time. Graphics are great for what it is and there is a bit of nostalgia too, the top down car driving reminds me of Grand Theft Auto 2, the first GTA game I played (lol, I was upset when GTA 3 went to a three dimensial look when it first came out and I was much younger. I thought it would 'ruin' the franchise because I loved GTA2 so much. But then I killed a hooker with a baseball bat and everything was OK, but I digress.)  I don't know if it has multiplayer and dont care as I am one of the 1% who lives in the boonies and can't play games online, but the single player is more than worth it, especially at the sale price of 2 bucks which I got it at. I'm not sure how long it is, im still working through it, but if its currently not on sale there are probably features you'll want to research to decide whether or not to spend 10 bucks on it (I think thats the non sale price).  Storyline is predictable but your not playing it for the story, your playing it to destroy zombies via motor vehicle. Have played it long enough to play the mission were you get to drive the tank and I must say it is extremely satisfying.  This is a good game, especially if you can get it for the sale price of 2.00 bucks or somewhere around there. Even if your not a fan of the zombie genre I would still recommend it. Who knows, maybe you will find you are a fan of the 'running over things and destroying them with fire as well' genre.  Simply: Good game, if you think you'd like it I can almost guarantee you would. I'd recommend more research if multiplayer is a must for you as I know it is for many gamers. Even if thats the case though, the single player is more than satisifying enough. I've used the word satisfying an awful lot in this review which I guess would speak to how much I enjoy the game and murdering zombies. GET THE GAME.
2149	1	a	this game would be awesome if the driving control was better, and not quite so slippery.
2151	1	a	This game was fun. I finished the story mod in 8 hours, so it could be longer. But there are other mods to try.  Missions are very similar, drive to escort someone or kill something. But the cool HD graphic and the satisfying feeling when you drive through the big horde is awesome!
2153	1	a	Suprisingly fun and addictive game, you can splash hordes of zombies untill you get your satisfaction. For 90c not bad not bad at all
2155	1	a	This is an awesome game i love it and hope you all buy it get it so awesome thanks so much makers of it wish i had the money to buy it right now but thanks to family share i can play it thank you so much

2159	1	a	Reminiscent of the original GTA. With zombies.  Also reminiscent of the old 1980s DOS game Autoduel, but in color. And with zombies.  Flamethrower ftw.
2161	1	a	this game kicks ♥♥♥ and rocks. if you dont have fun and enjoy this title something is wrong with you.
2163	1	a	Great game, highly recommended!
2165	1	a	Simply a must-have! Gameplay is addicting. Graphics are decent. Physics effects are GlOREious. Optimization is perfect. The amount of zombies on screen is incredible. Voice acting and grammar isn't the best, but who cares? Go blast some zombie äss and have a great time.
2167	1	a	Good game. Extensive content, variety in gameplay objectives (though simple), and overall good execution of devlopment. Fair value, too, and honestly the only time I've ever wanted a game that Steam gave me a coupon for! I have two complaints, however: the controls take a bit to get used to, and those who aren't familiar with any sort of top down driving game may have trouble adapting to them, and second, the voice acting is just an abomination. I digress, as this game is very fun and can provide many hours of gameplay and many millions of SLAUGHTER FODDER! :D
2169	1	a	If you're in the mood for some mindless slaughter of zombies, then this game is totally for you! Though I would definitely recommend having a controller for it, makes the game much more enjoyable.
2171	1	a	You should buy this game, if you like zombies and cars. Soundtrack and DLCs aren't bad either.
2173	1	a	Very funny game ;)
2175	1	a	Honestly, this game is not great but its not bad either. If you just want some mindless top down driver combined with zombies, go for it.

2177	1	a	Great Game Loads Of Fun !!!
2179	1	a	This remake gives the player everything what a good remake needs to. Better graphics, added gameplay elements with extended storyline (awesome new vehicles and boss battles), while keeping everything what made the original so entertaining, so if you enjoyed the original game or the demo of this version, give it a try!  Also this review was written some time ago and in the earlier version I was complaining about the really frustating (minutes length) loading times, BUT it seems like that the developers have fixed this issue with the DLC releases, so Thank You dev people for not letting this awesome experience be ruined by some stupid glitch. Now I can actually enjoy playing the game without worrying about that loading back the main menu will take effing 5 minutes.  P.S.: You can also drive a tank (not always of course, that'd be way too easy) to wade through the hordes of zombies. If THIS can't convince you, nothing will.
2181	1	a	Great indie title, with lots of fun splattering and shooting zombies.
2183	1	a	The camera is a bit dizzying at times and the controls take some getting used to, but the graphics are great and the arcade gameplay is bang on.   It took me two years to figure out that since the game requires you to manually select your video card model from a drop down list in order to wok, upgrading or changing your card after you've installed the game will cause it to break. I manually selected my actual graphics card, and voila, after two years the game finally works. Nobody got back to me and the forums came up dry on this issue. Gave it a bad review at the time because of this.
2185	1	a	A mindless zombie killing game. Best described as lizard brain porn (you don't need to conciously think about it, but it still is pleasing).
2187	1	a	You should buy this game, if you like zombies and cars. Soundtrack and DLCs aren't bad either.
2189	1	a	Not bad at all when bored.
2191	1	a	This game is simple to play, there are three different modes to try it works well with a controller and has plenty of achievments to get not mention trading cards, just a little repetitve but still a lot of fun.
2193	1	a	8/10 Good. The game is a perfect mix between racing and zombies, simple graphics but magnificent visuals, the missions are great, the zombie killing is intense and a lot of gore. I like this game and it is worth it.  Pros &amp; Cons: +awesome car upgrades. +big map to play in. +long missions. +sooo much blood and gore  -No free roam mode.. seriously, why?? -a few variety of weapons. 
2195	1	a	I like this game:) Recently i played on pc and the game i downloaded from windows store but the version is payable. So yee I love this game:)
2197	1	a	Good game! UPG racing ... alot of dead people there, survival mode and story mode.   Rate: 8.4
2199	1	a	If you like twinstick shooters you should like this, up there with renegade ops.  Worth grabbing with all DLC and its not expensive.
2201	1	a	A surprisingly fun game to ♥♥♥♥ around in
2203	1	a	I Picked this game up on sale.  Lots of fun and works nicely with my xbox controller! I enjoyed playing it when I'm board of all my more time demanding games.  I recommend this it for its price and entertainment level it well worth the buy! 
2205	1	a	Good game and beautiful game. You must try it! 10/10.
2207	1	a	Not bad game but the trading cards have horribly price.
2209	1	a	This game is fun to run over zombies and customise cars.  10/10
2211	1	a	Simple, but very well designed game. Lot of fun from driving and shooting to waves of zombies :). Another great feature - three completely different modes : story, 'survival' and races. I've completed previous version of the game and now i bought HD edition without any doubts.
2213	1	a	Rating: 7/10  A very fun, addictive game. It seems that driving over thousands of zombies and watching them splatter with full blood and gore effects never gets old!

2215	1	a	It funny, When i kill zombies with machine gun.
2217	1	a	Pretty good
2219	1	a	good little game
2221	1	a	I buyed because I like zombie game, this is one of the best PC zombie games I have played.
2223	1	a	This game is fun, and I enjoying to play it from time to time. Beware that this game is CPU Bound, and to get decent framerates you will need a decent CPU.
2225	1	a	If you like running over zombies and blood and cars this is your game.
2227	1	a	This game is intense with the zombie killing. The driving in the game is a little frustrating they let you go fast as hell but no where near enough room to drive around in and you cant tell what you can drive through and what you cant.
2229	1	a	Simple, but very funny and gory zombie carmageddon :) Nice graphics, but the perspective makes you nuts after a while. When quit the game after about an hour of playing, the walls are melting... ;) Still, thumbs up for this little gem.
2231	1	a	This game is still good
2233	1	a	An OK Cool game.
2235	1	a	A really good game its simpale and most important fun in many ways there is few game mods and a leaderboard if you care about being number one , i bought the complete edition because it was on sale -90% and its worth it trust me
2237	1	a	such game. much fun. wow
2239	1	a	This game is awesome, a lot really! It's just... ZOMBIES! What else can I say tough... It keeps you in constant seek of achievements, 100 achievements to unlock and do all possible to get them. It's a bit annoying some of them and also throughout the story, but far from that, it entertains you for a lot of time. I recommend it to those that are patient and wants to complete everything! Good luck unlocking all achievements!
2241	1	a	such game. much fun. wow
2243	1	a	I love this game. It's simple, but very fun just running over the zombies with nitro/guns, and just making your combo bigger, and bigger! Totally get it, if you like to just hit zombies without a second thought. XD (^w^ )b
2245	1	a	Imagine Crimsonland, but while driving a car... running over and shooting and burning and exploding millions of zombies. Heaven.
2247	1	a	This game is briliant fun and that's the key word- FUN!  I didn't know much about it, but bought it during a Steam sale for £1-09 sterling, very cheap including all the DLC.  There is a campaign mode, a slaughter mode and a racing mode. So far, i've only played the campaign mode.  I use an XBOX One controller under Windows 10 without issue.  The gameplay is frantic, yet easy to deal with. Plenty of gore, pickups and great visuals. The overall presentation, including the music reminds me of an AAA release.  If you want an immediate, fun game for not much cash, then take a look at this game.  Thanks.    
2249	1	a	First thing: I got this for .99 cents so the bar for 'good bargain' is very low...  That said, Zombie Driver HD is a pretty nice game: I am not even halfway through the main campaing, but between slaughters and tournaments I can't say I didn't had quite some fun, let's say 3-4E tier fun ;-)  The basics are quite simple: you drive a car with weapon mounts, and go around wrecking havoc on all zombies with the misfortune of crossing your path.  There is a campaign, where the developer feels obliged to give us a justification for shooting and running over things until they are turned into a red pulp, there is a number of tournaments with multiple disciplines, like:  * Race, where you should theoretically drive fast, but instead you end up doing everything but that, otherwise the adversaries cheat and win all the time * Endurance, a race where you drive a car rigged to a bomb and where for balancing reasons killing zombies is more important than driving fast * Eliminator, where you actually have to kill your adversaries to win, so at least for once you get to do what you are supposed to  and then there is the 'slaughter mode', where you just run over zombies for as long as you can, for those who find the campaing and tournaments too sophisticated.  The game is not perfect: as I said, the competitors cheat all the time for balancing reasons (as in the plain races, where otherwise it would be too easy to win) or to make the game more fun (e.g. in eliminator they defy all laws of time and space, appearing first in front of you, then behind, ecc... just to offer you more targets) and the campaing is kind of meh, but it's a total win for 99c and a nice game for less than 4E, so if you get it on sale, it definitely is worth a shot.
2251	1	a	Value for the price I got! Don't get this game when its not on sale. A nice little game you can play through despite little qurks and plaws here and here. I got the whole game and all DLC for 1$ and thats really all this game is worth, don't pay more for it or you'll be wasting your money.  TL;DR Get this game on sale. Not worth normal price.
642	0	a	Game breaking bug during Power To The People mission. Stuck at 0% and does not register completed objectives. Since it is a main mission there's no way around it. Neither loading an older save nor restarting the game helped. I even reinstalled and started a new game only to get the exact same bug during second playthrough. There doesn't seem to be any fix for this and the developers don't seem interested in providing it or any information regarding this problem. I can't recommend buying this game under any circumstances.
643	0	a	Warning!: This review will be in depth, and I will not include a tl;dr  After spending 13 hours with the main campaign, and finishing it, Homefront: The Revolution is easily one of the worst games I have ever played, but unlike most of the negative reviews for this game, I am going to give legitimate reasons as to why I feel this way  Before I get into the review, I would just like to say that before I purchased this game, I was one of the naysayers who defended it, beliveing that the game wasn't as bad as everybody said it was, but after buying and playing it, I hate to say that I agree with (most of) what people are saying  Onto the review   Pros 1. 2 Characters (Notice how I said 2, and not characters in general). Only 2 characters throughout this entire game were above the level of 'bareable'. Jack is the buddy/dudebro of the game, the guy that cracks jokes, kicks ♥♥♥, and is just fun to be around. Dana is batshit, but the good kind, the kind that makes the inner psychopath in you say 'I would totally do that!'. The rest are outright boring and flat, and when characters die you don't feel anything for them  2. The setting: Dambusters recreation of Philadelphia feels alive, and is bursting with personality. You actually feel as if there was a huge war, and that the KPA is a formidable force to be reckoned with, although I found the minimal refrences to historical monuments/figures odd for a city full chocked full of them  3. Alternate future: Since this game is based in an alternate future, it is plausible that the North Koreans were able to take over America, unlike the first game  Cons 1. The story: convoluted and uninteresting. It isn't easy to follow, nor do you feel very invested in it 2. The gameplay: combat is extremely clunky, (you get used to it over time), and because of this, it makes slogging through the games campaign all the more painful 3. Braindead AI: The AI is extremely stupid, the only way you get killed by them is if they swarm you, and this happens more often than not 4. Stealth is a no go: Killing a KPA soldier, even with a silencer, sends off an imediate alert that, instead of making nearby soldiers investigate your position, instantly spawns in enemies that start drilling you with bullets. Stealth is essentialy a terrible tactic, and the whole system needs an overhaul 5. Rinse and repeat objectives: So essentially to finish the story, you need to capture different points within the hub worlds, which then unlock the next mission in the story. The problem with this is, that is literally what you do for the entire game. It boils down to: Go here, clear and capture all of these points, then do the story mission(s), repeat. This gets extremely repetitive, and even borderline annoying, coupled with the fact that the gunplay is terrible makes it all the more dreadfull 6. Bugs galore. Whether it be floating pedestrians, stuttering or un-capturable points, this game is filled with a ridiculous amount of bugs that will end up frustrating you to the point where you don't want to play the game anymore 7. Phantom 'Open-world'. This games is NOT open world, like Fry Cry is open world. It is filled with 'hub worlds'. Think Dragon Age Inqusition type hub worlds.  8.Brady do this, Brady do that. BRADY, BRADY!: The games characters rely on you WAY too much, making you feel like you are the de-facto leader, and/or errand boy, when you are just another soldier fighting with the resistance. I get that you are playing the protagonist, but the game doesn't present you as anyone special, just another soldier, so another resistance fighter could easily do what you do 9. Resorting to Call Of Duty tactics: The game tries its best to paint your charatcer as a guriella fighter, and in the beginning of the game it does that. You will have low ammo, low health, and have to scavenge to craft items like molotovs or RC bombs that give you an edge. But by mid-game, you will have upgraded your character enough to where all of that gets tossed out the window, and you can essentially go rambo and just run in and gun soldiers down. Yes, you could 'role-play' as a guriella fighter, but the annoying AI doesn't/won't make you want to 10. Same-y enemies: It's essential the same enemy type over and over with no variation, and this really emphasizes that feeling of boredom you will eventually get 11. Moral argument: This one is personal, but I found the moral arguemnt discussed by a ceratin character in the game to be extremely annoying. His argument is basically 'see, this is what happens when you cause trouble!' I'm sorry, I didin't realize that a revolution was going to be PEACEFUL, when we are stock pilling weapons, ammo and materials for a godamn war. 'People get hurt' Well no duh, it's a freaking war for freedom, don't like it? Shouldn't have signed up in the first place.  12. Phantom 'Customization'. The 'on the fly' gun customization intially shown for this game is a ruse. There are few weapons to choose from, your setup will most likely end up being an SMG, Assault Rifle, and an RPG. There are few upgrades/attatchments that make each weapon feel unique, although there are some interesting conversions, maybe 2 or 3, but you will always end up switching back to the setup stated above 13. Compensation for braindead AI will make some missions difficult: In certain missions, the game will spawn endless hordes of enemies to compensate for their lack of good scripting/coding, and more often than not this makes missions a pain, especially missions where you need to defend something, or you have resistance fighting with you and they get mowed down 14. Poor character animation and lip sync: The characters animations are absolutely atrocious, espesially for a game released in 2016. Mass effect, yes the original, has better animations than this 15. Game breaking bugs: I haven't experienced this, but I know some people who have run into a bug during a certain mission that does not allow them to progress at all, making the game basically unplayable, besides co-op 16. Side missions: A complete waste of time, and unrewarding 17. Graphics: Graphics are generally good (that's cry engine for you) but some low res textures are pretty noticable  Things not mentioned: Multiplayer: didn't bother to try it, didn't feel like it would justify a 60$ asking price Season pass: not sure what they will include, but I know some people enjoy this game, so I won't tell you not to buy it  Final verdict: 2/10 Purchase recommendation: Do not pruchase, at all, not even on sale  I really wanted to like Homefront: The Revolution, I was part of the minority who didn't write off the game, and wanted to give it a chance, but sadly, that didn't happen. This game would have honestly done better as a linear shooter, because the main missions were easily the best part of the game. Sad to say, but in terms of overall game design, the original Homefront was leagues better than this game. Say what you will, but the original had better writing, an interesting story, great characters, great mechanics/gunplay, and included a Battlefield/CoD like, PvP centered multiplayer that gave it longevity and spawned a cult following. Dambuster essentially butchered that, and I fear this is the end of the Homefront 'franchise' (if it was ever one) and should be laid to rest
2253	1	a	My experience with the first Homefront game was not especially pleasant. Although the setting was well done and interesting (even allowing for the ludicrous plot) the game itself felt like every linear FPS single-player campaign criticism rolled into one. So when Homefront: Revolution was announced, I scoffed and then ignored it until recently when a free weekend had some friends reporting good things and I tried it. Glad I did.  I think most people compare HF:R to an urban Far Cry 3/4 but that's because it's largely true. Enter a region, note your plot objective, then ignore it as you fight your way through buildings, conquering then and flipping the map from red to blue. Actions can increase your standing with the city residents until they are finally inspired to rise up and riot, attacking their Korean occupiers. It's repetitive and, like Far Cry (or games like Mad Max or Shadow of Mordor), by the second strike point you'll probably know if you feel like playing 30 more hours because the game won't change significantly. The story is serviceable even if nothing amazing or thought-provoking. It's an excuse to run around a ruined city and shoot dudes and take over territory. The simple bottom line is that if you enjoy games in the Ubisoft 'point control' model, you'll likely enjoy Homefront: Revolution.  Guns were interesting though the system took me a little while to appreciate. You have your Primary/Secondary weapon but each of them can convert into two additional weapons. So your semi-auto pistol can convert into a small SMG and/or a silenced pneumatic pistol depending on your needs. Add in attachments (scopes, silencers, etc) and you get an impressive amount of flexibility and essentially seven weapons at a time (3x Primary, 3x Secondary plus an RPG) though you'll need to plan tactically and find cover to convert your assault rifle into a light machine gun on the fly. Still, it nicely bridges the gap between console-based limited gun slots and becoming a walking arsenal.  Finally, the game includes a co-op system where you and up to three friends can band together for missions and gain experience and money for skill/weapon/gear unlocks. Although there's an air of randomness about it (you buy a crate and hope for a good weapon), it's all self-contained and there's no item store or cash shops. The system is in addition to the single player game rather than the focus and it adds some additional play once you're done.  To be fair, trying Homefront: Revolution well after its initial release meant that I avoided its rocky, buggy launch and got in after the worst of it was ironed out. When I played, it was relatively bug free. No game-breaking issues for me, although once I dropped through the map and once had a physics glitch fatally launch me into the air. Out of 50 hours of play, I can't complain though. It played well on my aging system (i7-860 @ 3.6GHz, R9 290X, 12GB) with a consistent 60fps at 1080p on High settings.
646	0	a	I was willing to forgive the poor performance and numerous bugs until I got to the last mission and encounted a game-breaking bug. A piece of debris stopped an NPC truck from moving forward. I couldn't blow it up, shoot it, run into it, etc. Even loading the previous checkpoint didn't solve the problem. I reached out to Dambuster Studios and Deep Silver and have had no response yet.
2255	1	a	this game deffinately had a troubled lauch. devs are still sticking by it. this wasn't a cash grab. this was an honest effort to do the best they could and it's above average. it's above good. it's not great, but it's not even near mediocre/horrible. Game ran terribly when it launched for me. this has been fixed, runs smooth on an i7 and 970. no frame dips or anything. actual gameplay is fun, maybe a bit repetitive at times, but if you fancy the collector's mindset of the later far cry games, this will be fun for a while. not all tactics work on everything (shooting tanks won't do much, and not recruiting help from the other resistance fighters will mean you will die a lot) AI is horrible. most of the time they pose zero challenge, but once in a blue moon they seem ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t difficulty at a few moments. (forgot that one, thanks!) stealth isn't really doable in redzones, but thats to be expected. I would have prefered the game stay in a yellow zone during the start before switching over to a redzone after the tutorial is done, and also the motorbikes aren't a good vehicle choice for these environments, but the game is solid, fun, and now really polished. I'd reccomend it on sale if you liked far cry type games and are willing to look past the issues.    high 6/10 in my book.
650	0	a	Thumbs up for steams refunding policy, thumbs down for gameplay and optimization.
2257	1	a	- While the story is predicatable, the story is still good. - AI; the AI is pretty good, and underrated. - Although the missions can get repetitive, they are still fun because you can complete them in a number of ways. - Graphics are good, but not very optimized. - Devs are working to help fix the problems.  - Map is large, and fun to explore.   7/10: It's a fun far cry like game, that is unoptomized, but the devs are working to fix it. If you want it, I suggest waiting for a sale.  Edit:  - Patches have been put it, most notably the 2.0. - I believe that the game has been optimized better.  I'd still reccomend looking for a sale.
2259	1	a	This game took a lot of heat after it launched, with almost everyone saying it was terrible. I cant comment on this as i dint play it back then, But i can say that in its current state, i like the game quite a bit. The few bugs that remain are minor, and dont affect the gameplay significantly.  A few ppl still complain that its too hard, and that you can get swarmed by enemies, But in my opinion what those people dont understand is that this is one of those few FPSs where you are NOT invincible. You actually have to know when to fight AND when to run (like when reinforcements arrive), or you WILL die. I find this game mechanic very realistic, you are fighting in occupied cities, crawling with enemy soldiers. It makes sense that once you start trouble you HAVE to do your thing fast and go away before you get swarmed.  The weapons are great imo, they actually have recoil, you CANNOT carry 10 rifles, 1 rpg, 50 grenades and a flame thrower. You actually have a carrying capacity, and you also have a reasonable capacity on how much ammo you can carry. There is also a system where you customize and even transform your guns at any time, e.g. buy the proper 'kits' and turn your pistol into an SMG, add a silencer, or a laser sight, etc. Any time you want! no need to go to a 'weapons bench' or anything.  Some also say that the game is 'too generic', that it doesnt do anything diferent. I couldnt disagree more. In my eyes, -&gt;Realism&lt;- sets this game apart. You are NOT invincible, you CANNOT defeat 150 enemy soldiers at the same time, you CANNOT carry an entire warehouse of guns &amp; ammo, and you CANNOT endure 5 RPG hits to the head. Here you cant just go running arround shooting everything. You have to plan your attacks, or die. Overall i find the game realistic, and very fun to play.  Graphics are very nice, and currently the game runs fine on my less than stellar PC (i5, nvidia GTX 750ti). No performance issues for me. Controls are responsive and easy to learn &amp; use.  Bottom line:  If your idea of an FPS is 'i am God, no one can touch me, and i will just run and kill everything i see', then you will probably NOT like this one.  If you prefeer the gameplay to be more tense, where you need to plan stuff and act fast to avoid being chopped to pieces, conserve ammo, plan on what weapons are right for the current job, and know when you need to retreat instead of fight, then you will like this one!
2261	1	a	  I have heard a lot of negative things about this game. And after trying it during the free to play weekend myself, I don't really understand why it got so much hate. I have yet to experience a technical issue (aka crash to desktop, low FPS etc.), graphics are really nice and I really enjoy the whole gameplay aspect.  If you liked Far Cry 3, you'll like Homefront: The Revolution. 
652	0	a	I was expecting so much more from this game... It is a real shame.  First off, the performance is very ♥♥♥♥♥♥... FPS drops, but a patch is coming for that. Though im sure that patch won't fix the fact that I can run every other game on high settings, but this, I have to run on low settings and even lower the resolution below my native! Sigh.  Secondly, thinking the COOP would be cool? Nope, very small and limited mission based scenario's... It would have been so much better if we were able to free roam in the campaign world...  Unfortunately this game has bombed hard and won't recover from this, I highly doubt many people will still be playing within the next couple of weeks, which is a shame because no one wanted this game to succeed more than I did.... :(  Save your money, only buy if on sale for an EXTREMELY CHEAP price.
653	0	a	Bought it for the Guerilla Warfare  Thumbs downed it for the lies
654	0	a	...First off I'd like to say I'd like to see the folks at Damnbusters try again at a game. There's a few good bits in here, but as a first attempt... should've tried something not as ambitious.   Now I paid half price for this game. But as is, I don't think I can say it's worth that much.  It's pleagued with so many technical bugs. in the first hour of being in the open world I fell through the world twice and rode a bike through a wall 3 times.  Now design wise I see so much missed potential. It is so easy to avoid enemy patrols and if you have weapons out in the yellow zone(where you're suppose to blend in with civilians) I noticed no difference between if they see you waving around a rocket launcher or if you're just walking around. And I see where just living in one of these zones could be something. In fact it almost looks like that might've been a thing. And while I like the Farcry style capturing outposts, in this case it just seems played out. Like they try framing it in different ways so it's not all the same, but the reasoning for them is rather shaky.  Story... oh the story... it starts off kinda nice. but after a little while, it just falls down on its face. The people who have legitimate concerns about the reprocucions of your actions are just brushed aside as weak willed. If they object to questionable things the resistance does? Bleh, they're just not dedicated enough. Just a bunch of weak justification for calling the resistance good. I so want to spoil so much, but for those who decide to go ahead and play it I wont. Let me just say the ending... it needed work.  In the end... I wanted to like this. I steered away from the first one because it seemed a bit 'my country tiss of thee' for my liking. From what I saw from this before I played made it seem more like you're fighting for people rather than a country. Kind of dissapointed on that part as well. I really wanted to like this. But while I may revisit it from time to time, I can't advise you to buy it. Strong begining, but I can tell they crunched to meet the deadline.  If nothing else, they've inspired me to make my own game.
655	0	a	Really bad game, running a 6700k and a gtx970 g1 and stutters like crazy not recommended until they patch this, and still then not a great game 1st game was good though compared to this not tried multiplayer though.
656	0	a	Uninspiring gameplay, poor graphics for the Cryengine and horrible stuttering performance. Wish I'd spent my money on Doom.
2263	1	a	I have never written a reivew before because I generally feel like the community or the critics get it right. This game is a different case. This game is so underrated it hurts. I cannot speak for how it played at launch but I can speak to how it plays now. It honestly does something other games dont't, and thats give me a ton of tools but at the same time make me feel like an underdog. In my opinion the shooting is very crisp and strategic. Also the weapon modding is awesome making one gun so much more versitile. Also the story seems decent with a very good setting to boot. The graphics are good but demanding. Because of this if you don't have current hardware you should wait to buy this. so far I am only a few hours in but this feels like a more focused and difficult far cry game. Because of the launch issues this game experienced I think it's reputation got ruined. This is definetly one of those games that needs to be given a second chance because it's to much dang fun not to. To give you an idea I have an FX 8350 OC 4.5 and a GTX 970 and am getting between 35-50 fps on high settings at 1440p. Although these are not great number the game does not stutter at all (except when saving). I would say buy this from a key site or on sale just to be safe because others are still experiencing issues. After playing more I realize that the game is good at first but by the end becomes less alluring. I would still recomend it on a sale  graphics- 8.5 Optimization- 5.5 Story-7 Gameplay-8.5 Atmosphere-9 Fun factor- 8.5 Overall- 8  Even though this game is fun as all hell I would say steer clear unless you meet the recomended system requirements.  As a frame of reference some of my favorite games are the The Wiitcher 1-3, Bioshock 1-Infinite, Dark Souls 1-3, GTA 4-5, and the new wave of Fallout games. I would compare this game to Crysis mixed with Far Cry where you have more tools at your at hand but are also fighting agianst greater odds.
657	0	a	Kind of average. The game, mechanics are relatively dull and boring, AI is horrible. I find this disappointing, as I actually enjoyed the original Homefront, and was looking forward to this. 4/10
658	0	a	If you have liked any of the 'ticky boxing' game play seen in gaming in the past few years from assassins creed to batmans arkham to far cry then you'll enjoy this (which i did but the fun quickly wore thin very quickly).  The games objectives become very repetitive only after a few hours of gameplay like turning on a dozen hard to reach radios or liberating an outpost or turn on this tower through the most easy hacking mini game you wonder why its even there.   The hit and run tactics the game encourages you to use are null since even on the hardest difficulty enemies are easily defeated. Even the 'Sponge' enemies are only there to soak up bullets and cause just bit more damage.  Even though you cant use enemy weapons, enemy soldiers were kind enough to stock up on bullets for my guns when i eventually loot their corpses.  However, what you might hear in other reviews is that the atmosphere of the game is great, really gives you a sense of dread and despair but that soon washes away from the awkward voice acting and pitiful resistance enemy soldiers put up.  The game at times looks great especially when its raining during the night, it does look amazing but there often texture glitches and pop in effects with draw distance.   The on the fly weapon customisation is really cool but soon you find is surprisingly limited and you'll quickly being to rely on two weapons outside of the fun and gimmicky ones such as the shotgun that fires napalm or the 'freedom launcher'.  All and all an average game that isn’t crap but not spectacular either.  I only wish there was more to the game except go hear find x amount of things to unlock more things ad nauseam
2265	1	a	The first word that comes to mind while playing  Homefront: The Revolution , is 'atmosphere.' I'm a fan of atmospheric first person shooters, and I was recommended this game by someone who said it felt like  S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl . For you fellow STALKERS, I can't quite say it hits the spot completely, but it scratches that itch better than many other games. I recommend playing on the highest difficulty setting for best results.  Truth be told, this game scratches a lot of itches. I understand why it was critically panned: there are obvious technical and performance issues, the story is a bit obnoxious, and the characters are almost completely unlikable. But, it's far from being the 'worst game ever made' that some reviewers labeled it as. The gameplay here is prime. Depending on which 'zone' you're in, it sits somewhere between  Freedom Fighters ,  S.T.A.L.K.E.R.  , and  Deus Ex , with elements of  GTA: San Andreas ,  Terminator  and  Half-Life 2  thrown in for good measure. It has all the gameplay notes of a cult classic.  In the 'Red Zones' feel most comparable to the  Terminator  series' machine war scenes. The oppressive KPA army (the enemy in  Homefront: The Revolution ) patrols these zones with airships and drones that force you to crawl beneath rubble and ruined buildings to stay undetected and safe. The sound design, music and lighting in these areas are excellent, and create a constant sense of unease. I found myself cautiously peeking out from under cover to look for the telltale green search beams of the airships. The sound they make is... unsettling. One Red Zone even features a  Metro: 2033 -like gas mask mechanic, and although it honestly doesn’t impact the gameplay much (other than changing the visuals and sound a bit), it does go a long way towards making the game feel more hostile.  In the 'Yellow Zones' things feel closer to  Half-Life 2  and  Deus Ex . Trash and torched cars litter the streets, and people live in extreme poverty. KPA soldiers and vehicles patrol the streets in more formation, and individual officers harass civilians (much like the civil protection in  Half-Life 2 ). In these areas, you need to cause civil unrest by secretly sabotaging KPA propaganda equipment while remaining undetected. It’s thrilling to observe guard patterns from out of sight, and move your way through these areas stealthily.  While it may not be a perfect masterpiece,  Homefront: The Revolution  has extremely strong cult appeal. For the average gamer, this probably doesn’t mean much, but for people looking for something out of the ordinary, I highly recommend giving this a try. If you’re not sure, pick it up on sale like I did.
2267	1	a	I don't know why all the hate but to me this game is amazing. It has everything that I wanted.   First, a lot of people complaining about bad performance. I have a gtx980ti and I run everything maxed at 90-70 FPS. It drops to 57-54 there and there sometimes but nothing really bad. So to me the game is running smoothly and well.   The engine is amazing. The graphics, the animations, the rain, the lighting and the whole atmosphere look very nice. Oh and the cutscenes. They are beautiful, movie like, but not overdone, yet interesting to watch. Actually, this is one of the few games that got me really interested into them and not willing to skip.  The world doesn't feel empty. There is always something to loot, a secret to find or a piece of land to claim. You can always pick what you want to do next - a main mission, a small mission from the mission board or maybe conquest a stronghold or a sniper nest. Also there are dynamic objectives that popup when you are close to them - i.e. somebody contacts you via a radio saying they are pinned and need help to defend their outpost. Or find that juicy loot crate. And you can always pick the approach. What is even better, there are lots of NPCs around which you can recruit to help you with a simple button click. You can have up to 5 I think and each NPC in the world carries its unique loadout. They will help you by shooting enemies, throwing frags, some even carry rocket launchers - all accessible from a get go.   Gun fights are satisfying. There are no crosshairs so you have to aim, compensate the recoil and distance. Weapons have tons of upgrades and each of them have what the game calls a conversion system - i.e. you can convert an assault rifle into a machine gun or a sticky mine gun, a crossbow to a flamethrower etc. in a blink of an eye during the combat or before and then switch back when you want the previous weapon version right on spot. Weapons also have lots of mods and upgrades.   Yes, you can say that it is just an another average AC or Far Cry clone but this game is a blast to play provided you have a good enough system. What's most important to me - the game atmosphere and events shown in the cutscenes and during other moments really made me immersed in the game world willing to help the rebels win the war.   10/10
662	0	a	This game played me like a used car saleman, and by the time I blew through the story, I couldn't help but talk ♥♥♥♥ on it every time I thought about it. The only saving grace to this game was the multiplayer (or so I thought) because of the character customization, but you're lucky to find a single person playing the game besides you on any difficulty level. Steam wouldn't let me refund the game, and I feel bad because my brother bought it for me, thinking it would occupy our time until something good came out. Don't buy this game, just don't. There are a million and one other shooters out there that do it better. There's nothing new offered here. Save your money.
2269	1	a	If you want a solid, semi-open-world shooter with all of the modern frills, you could do far worse than Rev 2. The setup is still ludicrous -- North Korea turns America into an occupied apocalyptic hellscape -- but it's pretty clear that the headcanon is that China are the bad guys, which is slightly less ludicrous. In any event, I had a very good time crawling around like the dirty Yankee rat that I am, avoiding contact when I could, and gunning down the faceless Yellow hordes when I couldn't. All of the various gameplay systems work well without any real gripes on my part, except maybe that the weapons lack enough 'oomph'. The graphics and effects are nicely current-gen in 2016. I recommend Rev 2 to anyone who wants a decent FPS to fill their time between the big releases.   Note that I played the game after it was patched up and the price knocked down half.
663	0	a	Pink textures, 20fps drops, boring and uninspired plot and gameplay mechanics ripped from other games. I loved Free Radical Design, I loved Perfect Dark...but they should retire now and skip the slow death started with Haze.  The pros though...this game looks amazing. Everything else ranges from mediocre and unspired to utterly awful.  With patches the technical bugs might go. But that won't excuse the fact the plot is basically an amalgamation of COD, Dying Light and Far Cry. And none of those are particularly inspired either (but at least Dying Light had fun gameplay and Far Cry had excellent voiceacting).
2271	1	a	This game was an awful mess at launch, and it still has technical issues, but I think it's mostly been patched into something with some real value.  The campaign missions are generic modern shooter stuff, but the open world has fun elements. If you're into the 'liberate regions of the map with gunplay and some light stealth' gameplay of, say, Far Cry and want it in an urban, anti-authoritarian package, you'll probably like this game. The Yellow Zones (civilian regions where you have to inspire people into joining the resistance) in particular are fun as you have to sneak and run past large patrols while doing your best to cause damage and help people.  I recommend picking it up on sale. It's probably not worth a full $60, but for any less than that it's good if this is your kind of game.  I haven't played the DLC yet, so no comment on them and the season pass.
664	0	a	After finishing the game, I felt dissapointed. Not in the gameplay, but in the basic aspect of it. I loved the play style i chose, it was OP, but allowed for a challenge when i wanted it. I was a super fast stealth monster whose primary weapon was a knife and a crossbow. Many people complain about the stealth mechanic in the game being ♥♥♥♥♥♥, and i can agree a bit. If you are caught, everyone know where you are, but, considering its a super advanced army with self driving tanks, I would not be surprised. There were more stealth options than people think, including if you kill an enemy quick enough, they can't call reinforcements. Made use of that real well.  But....  There is one thing i hated, absolutely hated. It was so bad that I have to give the game a thumbs down. The story, As you started feeling emersed in the game, the story comes by and tears you away like a bandaid held on with super glue. like, WTF happened to the original mission!    Your original mission is to find some dude who was a huge asset to the resistance. Halfway through the story, you forget he exists and you never hear from him again.   And the ending was so anti climactic and made no sense. spoilers ahead.   You are so OP that you end up going through the final mission barely getting damage, then out of nowhere, without any context as how it happened, you are on your death bed, limping at 0.2 MPH and only have a pistol. Where the ♥♥♥♥ is my SMG, my battle rifle, my mine launcher. did they just disappear?!? And WHY THE ♥♥♥♥ DOES THE ♥♥♥♥♥ COMMIT SUICIDE I COULD HAVE TAKEN OUT THE GOLIATH WITH 2 ♥♥♥♥ING MINES!   I can't understand it. While playing the game you are a god who runs up to enemies and stabs the ♥♥♥♥ out of them while blasting heads off with ease. then all of a sudden you are stopped by a grunt who somehow sneaks up on you and slaps you in the face.  Here is another problem. People mix up open world and sandbox. Open world means you have access to the entire world, but it can still be controlled by the story. Sandbox means no rules. Fallout 4 is a good example. You dont even need to do the missions, you can go and destroy the entire wasteland right out of the vault.  On the topic of open. The story is linear as ♥♥♥♥. You have no control as to what happens. The only time you have the option to choose is when you decide to either kill, or spare a double agent. and you know what, your decision DOES JACK ♥♥♥♥! IT DOES NOT DO ANYTHING!!! HELL YOU ARENT EVEN SENT AN EMAIL OR TEXT SAYING YOU SHOULDA LEFT HIM ALIVE OR KILL HIM! LIKE NO INTERACTION TO THE DECISION AT ALL! If you are going to give the option to choose, that option HAD BETTER HAVE A RIPPLE EFFECT!  At this current point in time, don't waste your money on the game. If there is an update or even a DLC that fixes these issues and helps close holes in the story, then it may be worth the buy.
2273	1	a	The best game nobody wants to like. This game is like the perfect love child of Half-Life 2, Children of Men, Resistance 3, Dying Light, and Crysis.
665	0	a	If I could have refunded this game I would have. Its a terrible PC port. The biggest issues the game has is the control scheme, you cannot key bind other than default controls , as the default scheme remains active regardless what configuration you selected. I eventually just gave up and tried to use my wired 360 controller, that even had issues, with the UI prompts constantly flickering and not displaying properly when needed. I had to settle on using auto hot key, in which this is the 2nd pc port I've had to resort to this now.   Aside from it being a bad PC port. Its just not a very good shooter campaign. Don't let it fool you, this is just a run of the mill first person shooter campaign. It is hardly an open world game. There are no branching paths and nothing you do in the open world matters in the plot. I recently played through Killzone Shadowfall a launch game for the ps4 and it was infinitely better than this. I had way more fun with that, and its graphics were more impressive and it wasn't using cryengine running on ultra. Especially near the end of this game, the art assets looked very flat and very low res/ low poly for what is supposed to be the big finisher moment of the game.  The highlights of this game where when the engine shines, showing moody atmospheric lighting with contrasting lights. Also, If you are going to play this game, play it on the normal difficulty. Its not a well balanced shooter, even with all the upgrades, you will find yourself dying in under 2 seconds sometimes.
666	0	a	***Never ever buy this game***  Feels like it is still in Beta, however it has been sold and marketed as complete. This game is now so broken that it will freeze or black-screen within about 5 minutes of play. Sometimes publishers will push a game to be release too early and put way too much pressure on the developer. That could be the case here, howver since the patches have now made the game completely unplayable I'm leaning towards total incompetence as the main cause. Here are some of the persistant issues: - Pressing or spamming *Enter* will sometimes not skip logos upon startup despite displayed message stating to do so. - Game black-screened with continuing audio, after opening cinematic on first try. - Awkward and dysfunctional parkour. Dambuster Studios could take some lessons from Assassin's Creed. - Bad AI. NPCs have a habit of trapping you in a corner or blocking a doorway. - Can't do the Car Park Chop Shop mission due to a bug with the motorcycle dyno which results in the rollerdoor not opening. - Gameplay completely stalls on the Power To The People mission, meaning that you can make no further progress in the game. Only option is to restart from the beginning with a random chance that it may happen again. - Light outside of doorways is too blinding and washed out to see a KPA target shooting at you. - NPCs clip through each other, the ground, and other objects. - NPCs will come and stand in front of you just as you pull the trigger on your RPG resulting in their death and possibly your own. - NPCs in your squad act like they're on an invisible bungie cord and will stand so close to you that they can push you off a ledge. - Patches are reminiscent of DayZ, where every patch makes something worse. - Developer wants to expand the game in the future so it's quite likely that more features will be broken in the future.  *Edit: *Now that the game has been 'patched' you can expect more frequent black-screening, even on the introductory level. *The frame rate is so bad after the introductory level that it stutters worse than Michael Palin (as Ken Pile) in A Fish Called Wanda.  *Edit: *The latest 2.0 patch has resulted in a weird stuttering issue related to the running mechanics. Also seen in running NPCs. *For some reason they've spent time adding 2 new maps for the 3 players that still play resistance mode.
667	0	a	It is huge step up from how I remember the first being, the open world and revolution are a nice touch but its just so easy. On the hardest mode the AI has no other moves then get in cover and call for more people to get in cover, although you take a decent amount of damage it doesent change how overpowered your weapons are and how easy it is to upgrade everything. Half way through the game I ended up in a new yellow zone that 'Isnt like anything you've seen'.... it was alot more pretty for about 2 minutes before i hit a couple of radio's.... if thats all the revolution needed then why the ♥♥♥♥ are we trying so hard to save this dude. I dont think i'll end up finishing this just because it wasnt very challenging at all, If the end turns out being you're all we ever needed I wouldnt be suprised though. In the end even with the extra mechanics it felt like a watered down division.  Just a sidenote almost all the negative reviews mention bugginess which i cant comment on, worst thing I came across was terrible AI popin, half a block away stuff would spawn and despawn, but the actual game seemed to play fine, might be an issue related to certain people?
668	0	a	Bought this game and in the 1 hour i attempted to play i crashed every 2 mins on a dedicated gaming PC, got a refund. I don't recommend getting this game until they patch this mess.
2275	1	a	Great open world game with a gritty atmosphere, runs pretty smooth on my machine (NV760, quadcore haswell cpu from 2014, 16 gb ram). If you liked Far Cry 3 + 4 (I did, although FC4 did not add enough to the formula compared to FC3) and Mad Max, you might like this one, too. Don't immediately believe what people are saying, go have a look at some of the lets plays and decide for yourself.
2277	1	a	Fun game most of the time. Gameplay reminds me of Crysis and Dying light. Graphics could be better, AI could be better, physics could be better, Story could be better... beer helps make it better. Definitely worth it on sale. 6.5/10... with beer 7/10
673	0	a	1 HOUR PLAYTIME  Now I write this first review with no hatred whatsoever (unlike everyone else)  The game started with a great opening, the story line is exciting and the opening scene gets you in the zone... My first walk around the neighbourhood was slow... the textures look great, the environment is wonderfully detailed with many unique objects around to complete the immersive experience making the environment feel busy and alive. The main characters so far are all unique and have different personalities... the ambient NPCs are cool too however there is an issue with the rigging as their necks look like they are possessed by a demon... There is also an issue with the NPCs interaction with their environment and other NPCs as I seen 2 of them walking into eachother and continued walking on the spot.  Sounds used in the game are excellent however the fades/crossovers need work, as sounds are often clashing with one another, overpowering or even turning off other sounds altogether. Now I'm not like these other morons out there that say a game has optimization issues because they aren't getting 120FPS, we all know anything over 35 is excellent for gameplay... however this game does have optimization issues, but it's due to the environment being so detailed and RAM consuming... but it does need work because as soon as i got into battle, I couldn't play it... let alone ride a motorbike at full speed... it ruined it for me... I'm yet to turn all my settings to LOW and see how it goes... FYI I'm running Alienware with GTX680 and 32GB RAM... I play the division on mostly high with a couple ultra settings with no slowdown...  Player movement feels very stiff like me on a Saturday morning, interaction with objects and climbable areas sometimes takes a few times to register...  The weapon custimization options are exactly the same as Crisis which I dont mind at all as it's a cool looking system... The graphics are beautiful the plot is excellent and I'm really liking where this is going, as I haven't played a good UPRISING styled game since half Life 2... but right now, where it is... I CANNOT give it a thumbs up... in fact I am very disappointed I purchased this as in Australia, this game costed me $70 AUD but I'm not sure if I want to refund or not... I'm holding the hope that this game will be rescued...  I was a big fan of the first Homefront when noone else even liked it, because it was too linear and short... but it was a good game... I will update this review after a few bug fixes, but right now I just cant play it...   IN FUTURE DEVELOPERS... BE SURE TO QUALITY ASSURE YOUR PRODUCT BEFORE YOU SELL IT... DON'T BE LIKE SO MANY OTHER COMPANIES AND SELL AN UNFINISHED GAME AND THEN HAVE THE CHEEK TO SELL DLCs...  3/10 
2279	1	a	Honestly not even a fraction of as bad as people say it is.  Guns feel nice. Neither you nor the enemies are bullet sponges. Story is interesting enough to keep you going. Don't expect a full open world RPG though. The open map serves only to give you a sense of freedom of engagement and movement, but it should be played running from mission to mission, the open world is not enough to keep you entertained for long, at all. This game can be compared to Far Cry 3/4 in terms of gameplay, but I think this game fixes a lot of things Far Cry 3/4 did wrong, such as the aforementioned bullet sponge enemies and the general feel of the weapons. You don't have a huge arsenal to choose between, but just enough to fit every possible playstyle, and the game features a rather simplistic weapon modding mechanic which allows you to toggle between certain weapon types, the pistol can quickly be converted into an SMG for example, and the rifle can be modded into a sniper in a matter of seconds, depending on if you've bought the mod.  All in all, a strong 7/10 in my opinion.
674	0	a	Story: Predictable, I'm ok with that Gameplay: Fair, slightly interested, I like it Graphics: Amazing assuming your comp handles it correctly(Many people have bugs, I do not) Bugs: MASSIVE AMOUNTS! AI Bugs, Wall Bugs, Graphic Bugs, and GAMEBREAKING BUGS!  I was ok to keep the game and play it through even with the bugs until I ran into GAMEBREAKING BUGS over and over again. 4 times I ran into these bugs. I reported them, I also reported how to recreate them. As of 5/22/16 they are not fixed. I am not a play tester for this game, but I assure you it needed some. These bugs were easily found and recreated.  Now how are these bugs Gamebreaking? Basically, it puts you in a mission that can neither be completed or end. Often area becomes a ghost town because AI won't spawn properly, or they get stuck in walls. Your objective will be to do X, but you have already completed X so you can't do it. Quest/Mission Flag fails to realize you have already done request. You are just stuck in same area, with no way to proceed in the game. Does not reward exploring because you might bug your game if you explore something too early.  Thats ok, I can just go to a previous save right. NO... by the time you figure out you have put yourself in a never ending bug. Its too late. There are no save states. Game autosaves and autosaves often. You have a total of 4 autosaves. These autosaves happen whenever you do something significant or if you change your weapon at a locker. Basically, you can't rely on savestates to return to if you bug the game.  Their solution if you get bugged and cannot proceed.  1. Wait for patch to fix bug.  2. Erase your saves, and start over.   I started over 4 times, and found different Gamebreaking bugs each time. The only way to avoid these bugs is to not explore and only follow mission requests. Makes game boring and not fun at all. 
2281	1	a	Update after finishing the game:  I have to bump the overall score down to 6/10 :( I don't want to spoil anything for those considering buying this game but mehhhhhhh on the ending. The game was still hours and hours of fun but it almost feels like they rushed the plot to ship the game in time. It was probably the most un-interesting, short-sighted, predictable ending of any video game, ever.   Also I found something that really helped performance big time about half-way through. Put the object detail at medium. I could hardly tell any difference between medium and very high, and I was able to max everything else out and play with a pretty much locked 60fps @ 2715x1527 which looks considerably better than 1080p. And oddly runs much better than 1.5x supersampling in-game.  Good try Dambuster - hopefully you'll have some great lessons learned from all of the user feedback and will make a truly great game if there's a sequel.    Original review:  I waited 10 hours to post my review because I wanted to give HF:R a fighting chance.  Short version:   7/10 - I say buy it Pros: Actually pretty damn fun so far Cons: GPU utilization/frame pacing issues reminiscent of Fallout 4  Long version:  Maybe my version of a fun FPS is different from 99% of the world, but I'm actually really enjoying this game. Considering DeepSilver/DB inherited a POS bankrupt title that was tossed back and forth for 4 years like a red-headed high school cheerleader, I think the results are pretty great.  Sure, there are some framepacing issues, GPU utilization problems, and yes theres some points where it's sort of mindboggling that basic features arent there (hello...cough... save game), but the overall presentation is pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ good and enjoyment is high. Maybe I'm weird... but I was compelled to write a review in favor of this game after seeing so many bad reviews before playing it.   All I've seen are reviews saying how disasterous the performance is. I also see the majority of reviews saying the gameplay is bland, combat is weak, stealth system sucks, graphics are underwhelming, on and on and on. I disagree with those for the most part too. I swear people are way too critical. Here's my take:  Stealth: 7/10 - If it had better cover mechanics, or even the ability to lean from cover, it would be 8 Combat: 7/10 - it does feel a little sluggish at times, but I turned auto-aim off Graphics: 6/10 - compared to Division or UC4, which have set a new bar for graphics these days Enjoyment 8/10 - despite the lower scores above, for some reason this game is totally pulling me in, its fun! Performance: 5/10 - see below Story: 5/10 Value: 7/10  The only real major flaw I see so far is a GPU utilization problem. A 6700k/980ti combo should be able to run a Dying Light clone (essentially what this game feels and looks like to me) at a resolution of 2715x1527 @ max settings and achieve a locked 60fps with about 90-95% GPU utilization. With HF:R it's nowhere even close to that. I'm able to get 55-60 fps @ 1920x1080 but it only uses about ~65% of the GPU to do so.   If I step it even 1 notch above 1080p, or use supersampling at all, framerates become wildly unstable - as does the GPU utilization. Even at 1080p there are a few very rare and unexplainable dips into the high 40s. Every time it happens the GPU util actually drops to around 30-50%, almost as if something's choking the bandwidth. Actually, it's a similar symptom to Fallout 4. Even with the necessary hardware to run it at 2k DSR max settings, the game just couldn't keep up with the draw calls - showing the signs of an aging engine I suppose.  But to note: the frame rate issue (for me anyway) is very infrequent ... maybe 3-4 times in the 10 hours I've played. I think it's a minor nuisance. The rest of the time it's a pretty stable 60fps using ~65% GPU at max settings. Good enough to be enjoyable.  Anyway - I don't understand what's with all the hate. It's a fun game and a killer concept with only minor performance issues. If they fix the framerate issues I'd even go so far as to give it a 7.5 out of 10. If you're on the fence but enjoyed Dying Light, I'd say buy it. You'll probably enjoy this game. It's kind of like a mix of DL and Division... sorta. Maybe wait until it goes on sale, which with the number of negative reviews sadly, probably won't take very long.  Specs:  I6700k Gigabyte G1 980ti 64gb Dominator Pro DDR4 950 Evo NVME Asus Hero Viii
677	0	a	I thought they'd try to improve the franchise and make it into a better game. But sadly homefront the revolution suffers from the same problems as the last game such as poor optimisation, controls, AI and audio quality. However it is a solid first person shooter when it runs. Hopefully they patch this game soon so i can actaully play it
2283	1	a	I bought HF:TR for only 11$ in the Steam sale, I must say it is a great game. This game has on my rig pretty good optimization (AMD RX480). I play on 1080p with almost always 60 FPS on the highest settings.  The graphic is great. CryEngine really delivers it. The sound as well.  The plot is nice and the characters in the game are interesting, but it is not more than decent.  The gameplay is very similiar to Farcry gameplay: open world shooting game where you need to unlock outposts (or any other way you want to call it) and have a main missions that you can do.  The game is pretty easy as well.  in the end I think you should buy this game in a sale. it is a decent fun game. DONT BUY FOR CO OP! CO OP SUCKS ♥♥♥!
2285	1	a	Bought this game on the last free weekend. Never regret buying this game. Eventhough not as bad as what the reviews said, it does still has some bugs, glitches and a few crashes. Across 26 hours of playing, i got like 7-8 crashes with 2-4 hours range for each crashes.  + Pros: - Graphic is goooood - Weapon modification is cool, the flamenwerfer is awesome and battle riffle sure packs a punch, but my fave is always smg - Open world far cry style, with minor stealth element (really really minor) - Motorbike, unfortunately, you cant kill the Norks by crashing your motorbike, they always find a way to disable your bike first - Cool gadgets, rc cars with mounted explosives is great for blowing things, besides explosives you got hacking device, firecracker,and molotov - Resistance mode is great, IMO, its better than the main game  + Cons: - The stealth, is weird, killing an enemy with suppressor weapon will alerts other enemies even after the guy died, but with crossbow, this doesnt happen - Mediocre story with some holes, like no explanation in some parts, like how did he still alive after getting that many shots and wth happened with walker - Dana Moore, she's creepy  - Hacking, meh - Crashes, 7-8 times (might be more, I didnt keep track), but never crash in Resistance mode, some minor bugs and glitches  Conclusion, I recommend this game, but get it only when its on sale. If it runs good on your rig, enjoy. If its not, refund.    
680	0	a	lazy to write a long review because ain't worth my time. Long story short, this game suffers heavily from bugs and glitches, There is no point in playing until the end with this uninspired setting and boring story and characters. I don't feel attached to anyone because there are no personality in these characters. Game graphics looks superior because it is built on the Cry Engine, but other than that, there is nothing great in this game worth mentioning. My rating: 1/5
681	0	a	In advance sorry for bad english  Bougt the 80 Euoro pak.... totaly not wort it! only good was the weapon thing it felt nice and sort of new. graphichs were decent.  but got what a mess and I dont need to list them all. just look at any and i mean any review on youtube or anywhere. its terrible ;( witch make me sad , becuse I was really looking forward to it Btw I have a good pc i7 at 4.6ghz hexacore , 34gbddr4 ram, 2x gtx980 strix and only ssd´s  Thank god for Steam Refound &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3 (Saved my ♥♥♥ this time)
682	0	a	This game had great potential, sadly it didn't live up to the hype
683	0	a	The Story feels rushed, and not at all immersive. The characters are easily forgettable. C0-op is pretty much dead in the water after 3 days of being released (Where is everyone?) Terribly optimized even for my high performance PC. (SSD's, 980ti, i7 4770k)  Too bad, I was really looking forward to this game.
684	0	a	I've always thought Homefront was an underrated game, and prior to release I had somewhat high expectations for Homefront: The Revolution. But, what I see here is a Far Cry clone, and a bad one at that. It takes elements from most popular games of the last half decade and doesn't really have anything that helps it standout from the rest of the copy pasta open world games.   So, I went into this game with low expectations, and even getting the game for 20$, I have a really hard time recommending this. I am a sucker for Ubisoft games like Assassin's Creed and Far Cry, and I have a feeling the developers of H:TR are as well, so they tried to mimic that, and it just turned out mediocre. Most of what the world has to offer, side content wise, is the same 3 or 4 things copy and pasted 50 times, just like a Ubisoft game, but in THIS it's even more meaningless.  The gameplay is alright, the weapon customization was ripped straight out of Crysis, the enemies take way too many shots to kill (for example, a pistol being 2 shots to the head at point blank range, wtf?), while you can die in about 5 or 6 shots, and this is on the medium difficulty. If you think dying in 5 or 6 shots sounds reasonable, imagine 15 Korean dudes shooting at you with fully auto weapons. You die very quickly and very often, and for a game like this is not ok.  The AI is dumb as a rock, when going into combat they seem to infinitely spawn until you either run away and hide, or die, which will happen a lot, because the game is difficult for no reason.  The story is nothing to really pay attention to, the characters look cool, but they're dull, of course, just like the rest of the game.  The only good thing about the game might be the graphics. It runs on Cry Engine, so naturally it will look half decent.   I don't know if I missed anything. I've played it for a few hours and I feel like I've seen it all. I had somewhat high hopes for this, and it really could have been good, but it's just a poorly made, rushed mess.   With all that said, and the fact that the game has many, MANY problems, I must say I do find it somewhat enjoyable. It's not the kind of game to get super invested into, but it's fun to play for an hour at a time, every now and then.  I'd give this 4/10. Not a good game, but also not the worst.
685	0	a	The game itself is incomplete. ' unfinnishable' the last area hearts and minds cannot be raised despite having completed every other objective in each oth the other areas. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. If you do ignore this message and purchase it, make sure you do this through PAYPAL, that way you can dispute it through them, the game is not a completed game as steam advertises it to be.
686	0	a	Pardon me while I spawn into a grey world under the map...   I'll play through the rest of the story, try the multiplayer another few times, but this unoptimized glitchfest needed another month or two of bugfixes and testing before coming to market.
2287	1	a	I can’t understand why this game is getting bad reviews. Story line is good, gameplay is tight, and the graphics are top notch. Running Homefront on its highest settings is going to be demanding but if you’ve got a strong system then you’ll appreciate the benefits of this game. CryTek’s CryEngine 3 is still one of the best game engines used. Frame rates are high and crashes are extremely rare. Homefront: The Revolution may not be a contender for game of the year but it is a formidable release and well worth the investment.
688	0	a	So yeah played the game, well most of it until it ♥♥♥♥ed up, I'm in a mission and this truck that I have to escort, won't drive the way it should, keeps driving into another truck. So don't buy the game, since it doesn't work right, wast off money
2289	1	a	Well,I actually enjoyed the game.I know it has gotten some bad returns but for me...I had a blast!The story is what you would expect from an apocolyptic end of da wurld! senario but not bad as these stories go.The graphics are about the norm for this day and age and the detail is admirable.The music is cryptic in some levels and really adds to the feeling.Now the good part.....GRENADES AND THE LIMPET MINE LAUNCHER.Since there are no gibs to speak of the rag doll mechanics is hilarious.Stick a limpet mine at a soldiers feet and watch the fun.....40 feet in the air and a resounding WHTAGHHHHHHHH!The heck wit da plot and hand me a grenade.The side quests are more like mini-games than quests and the voice acting is really pretty well done also.The mocap could have been a little better but in the end it's whether you had fun ....and I DID!All in all well done....for ME!If you can get it on sale so much the better.7\10
690	0	a	Lot worst than expected, bad sneaking mechanism &amp; unlimited enemies coming when u trigger fire fight.  Also as other states sometimes fps significantly drops and the voring content repeat over and over again.  
691	0	a	  Played this over the weekend both co-op and singleplayer and it's just... eugh, I know we have to give concessions to open-world nature but, it quickly just felt like &lt;Insert Ubisoft Open world title here&gt;   Goto location, kill the guards, press button, suddenly these resistance members move in, if there's any AI enemies nearby they'll be as shocked as you are that these people arrive (Had a hilarious moment when a drone flew upto a man with a rocket launcher on his back, scanned him as clear, flew away and then everyone started shooting)  It has some fun ideas but it's not well implemented or introduced (Which is a shame) the stealth feels hit and miss with enemies seeing you through walls and not seeming to be alerted when the guy next to them suddenly falls over dead.  I won't bother too much with the story because it just fell flat on it's face with this Apex corporation trope (If anyone who did finish the story, please tell me it didn't involve norks time travelling with technology, cause if it did I'll cry) Unlikable characters, no clear reason why the North Koreans are such bad people just 'Merica can't be tamed y'all  The co-op is the only bit I had quite a jolly time with, although it was mainly laughing at the game, as tanks appeared infront of us, the gear unlocking limiting the missions somewhat, some objectives not unlocking.   All in all, it's a fine example of what development hell does to a game, plenty of good ideas poorly integrated, also I smell crytek all over that retconned story.
692	0	a	Homefront®: The Revolution is Now Available on Steam, Crashes on Launch, Patch one, Fixed it (at least for me), YAY! Crashes after mission one...
693	0	a	After less than 2 hours of gameplay, I must say this is a game you DO NOT want to play. The story is somewhat interesting though I found a game breaking bug that not only ruined the game but brought to light other issues. Singleplayer Only!  The Pros: Graphics are pretty good Custimization is ok but nothing too great except the modification change.  The Bad: The bugs are too many to really even count.  The game feels sluggish with a 980ti - poor optimization Game breaking bugs that end the storyline/optional side misisons Enemies don't drop guns or give ability to pick up guns, instead ammo for whatever gun you use. Game is not unique at all. It feels like they tried to make a hybrid of several games but failed. Terrible voice acting.    
2291	1	a	not a bad game! story and characters are forgettable, but the gameplay itself isn't the worst and the guns feel satisfying enough - a good game to try if you want an urban far cry style game!
2293	1	a	I have heard that this is the worst FPS, and that it sucks, and it is bad. I played it in the free weekend, and I got to say, that if you think this is the worst FPS, you frankly have not played many games. For me, this is above average. I really enjoyed the feeling of hopelessness, and the rebellion aspect. Im going to pick this up soon on the winter sale, but do not let mixed reviews deter you. It is better than you think.  EDIT: Just recently bought it, and so far, it is really good. Is it the best game of all time? No. Is it the worst? No. Does it have great shooting, ideas, and gameplay? Yes it does. I say pick it up on a sale. This game is great at making you feel a part of a revolution and does guerilla warfare well, even though the AI is dumb at times. The game feels like Far Cry in an urban setting. The red zones all feel like something out of terminator with less robots. Also, some people say Norks is a dumb word. It actually was used in the Korean war when speaking about North Koreans, so the devs did their research, but most people do not know that. Pick it up if you like Far Cry but want a more atmospheric game and feel more like an underdog.
697	0	a	I had some high hopes for this game after playing the first one. I was expecting multiplayer like battlefield but instead It's co-op mission based multiplayer. Single player was under whelping, I stopped the campaign within 1 hour, I couldn't force myself to play anymore. I would pass on this game, definitely not worth $60. If you think this will be a fun game I'd wait for a price drop, at least 50% off.
2295	1	a	Well im only four hours in, but cannot see the hate for this game - Its like a dirty farcry 3/4 - gunplay is great; loads of small skirmishes to engage in; its got a large open map; campaign seems a long length; loads of small side missions which give you this games equivalent of XP so you can upgrade weapons etc; graphics are supurb, though with my 290x, Iv had to go to medium to enable smooth framerates, but still looks great.  I can see the gameplay mechanics possibly getting a bit samey throughout the campaign, but at present Im thoroughly enjoying this - A+++++++++  Update 31/12/16 - well im 22 hours in now and am pretty far through the single player - have got loads of side missions untouched, so plenty of playability yet. Am still thoroughly enjoying this game - still cant believe the hate this has been getting - gunplay is wonderful as far as im concerned - story line - yeah its ok, but its the firefights that win me over every time - A++++++++++ - its also on the Steam sale at the mo for £8.99 - unbelieveable value if you ask me - go get it !!!!!!!!
2297	1	a	It's not the most interesting game, but I have to admit that I actually had fun with it during the free weekend they did. And once we got used to the coop, the boyfriend and I had quite a lot of fun in that actually. The weapon customization is actually pretty damn nice and the standout element of the gameplay. Swapping out different receivers for each weapon to make them do something different is actually really good. While technically only carrying three weapons, the pistol and two primary weapons, the alternate receivers are always available meaning you effectively have nine weapons at all times if you have all the receivers for each weapon. It's something I'd really love to see in a lot of other games. The open world is what you'd expect from the recent Far Cry titles, or any open world game from Ubisoft really. Clear out rather meaningless outpost/checkpoint style zones until you've filled up a meter. At least there is an actual change in the world, albeit minor, when you fill up that meter. People start appearing on the streets of the 'yellow zones' protesting and fighting with the KPA, things are lit on fire, it at least feels like there is some response to your actions. Gunplay is fairly solid, some guns feel a little weightless and meager, but some really feel good to fire. Coop is the highlight of the whole game though. While set up just as preset missions set in the singleplayer maps, usually with restrictions on where you can go without completing certain objectives, it feels fun playing alongside others. As opposed to the singleplayer, you also have character customization in the form of picking various skills and wearable equipment to give you different passive perks and different cosmetics. I feel like the only downside is that I really wanted even more to do in the coop because it was genuinely that fun. For $15 it's definitely worth it, even for $20 though I'd say it's certainly worth it if you aren't opposed to the more typical Ubisoft style open world in the singleplayer.
2299	1	a	Single player / Coop Game  + This game uses a bunch of game mechanics that we've seen before in other games, but it uses them well in an open world first person shooter. It's a fun single player experience with lots to do.  + It has a fun coop game mode that uses an rpg style character progression system. 10 coop missions (at date of review)  - It's hard to find a random player for coop. Coop mode allows you to create a game and play by yourself but it won’t be open for other's to join. This creates a bunch of private games happening with everyone playing by themselves. 
710	0	a	I spent 33 euros. Still not worth it. Played 5 hours now. And all i feel is being bored. Side Missions are boring, main missions are boring. Characters are not likeable. Worst weapon handling i´ve seen for a long time. All weapons feel the same. Lot´s of performence issues. Have i7 6700K, GTX 970 OC and 16 GB DDR4 RAM and guess what? Frame drops, freeze, audio stuttering. Dialogues are horrible. Oh did I forgot to mention? Yeah, glitches, bugs and getting stuck on everything in the world.  Really hoped it would be good after the first trailers. But no!!! Don´t buy this game.
2301	1	a	With only a taste test so far; a little over an hour in the first Red Zone (Hot zone), I can tell I'll enjoy this regardless of story length. Mainly as it uses mechanics from two of my favorite games (Far Cry 3/4 &amp; Dying Light) in a Red Dawn/Revolution setting that's right up my alley.   Unless this game does a total 360 as I progress, I have no prob recommending to those who enjoy loot shooters at the normal price (39.99). If it does flop as I progress I will definitely alter my recommendation.
2303	1	a	This game seems to be a bit of a mixed bag for a lot of people. I personally love this game though... would strongly recommend if you like any of the Crysis games' gameplay/graphics. The only downside I have with this game is the optimization, which, quite honestly, isn't all that good... I can run nearly all the latest games on Ultra @60fps so my PC isn't the issue here. I tinkered with The Revolution's graphical settings a bit and finally found the optimal one which stays at @60fps 95% of the time, which is great! Didn't even have to go all the way to Low settings, fortunately... but then again, I shouldn't have to do that when my PC has the power to run it at Ultra quite easily. I will list some of the pros and cons below (That I think make the game good and bad)  PROS: - Good gameplay/combat -Beautiful and immersive environments -Awesome weapon customization (about customization in cons) -Cool concept for a game -Day and night cycle -Lots of free-roam content --------------------------------------------------------------------- Cons: -Bad/stupid enemy AI -repetitive sidequests -Bad optimization (I hope they'll release more stabilizing patches) -Lack of weapon customization parts -The game could use more weapons overall. -Re-appering character models w/ body parts switched ---------------------------------------------------------------------- If this review helps you, leave it a thumbs up. Thanks! :)
2305	1	a	So this game has been getting many many bad reviews because of its 'terrible frame rate' and 'clunky gameplay' maybe its just my computer but this game has FANTASTIC gameplay!! it feels so good to just walk! and to run and climb and shoot. the gunplay is a bit sluggish but that is more because the game is going for a more realistic take on gunplay. its not like call of duty. its not my favorite type of gunplay mechanics but for what it is its fantastic. Not to mention the amazing graphics, story, and how gosh darn likable ALL of the characters are! the characters are all great! even people you just see on the street. they all feel so real! it really gives the entire game a different feel than most shooters! also the world is massive! it feels so open and free even when youre running through crowded alleyways. the weapon customazation is also really neat! you can see your character take apart your pistol and install parts to turn it into an SMG right before your eyes! it really interesting!! so overall i say this game is GREAT. maybe the framrate is actually pretty crappy for a normal computer, my computer is an absolute monster so...  well i freaking love this game. id definatly suggest giving it a try especially now that steam will let you refund games! id honestly give this game a solid 8/10. its pretty much all i expected and i am quite pleased with my perchase.
722	0	a	Thank you Deep Silver and Dambuster for the free weekend. Unfortunately, this game is not very good.   Ostensibly a mix of Far Cry, Stalker and Freedom Fighters, it soon reveals itself to be a mere Crysis-alike with a gimmick. The weapon customization menu probably gave that away to some of you.  The story is very predictable and at times comically vile. And it's absolutely terrible! There's no reason to play Homefront: The Revolution for the story, its perfunctory rah-rah patriot ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t doesn't even compare favorably to the Call of Duty garbage of a few years back.   But does it at least play well? Eh... not really. The gunplay and movement is typical for CryEngine - that is to say not very good. Even smooth 60+ fps can't hide the weird player movement and unsatisfying gun action. The novel weapons aren't really fun to use, which is an absolute bummer.   Painting the map blue by liberating outposts and strongholds also loses its draw after the first map. The concept of Yellow Zones is interesting on the surface, but completely wasted in practice. Sprinting past guards takes care of every problem. The world just doesn't feel believable or internally consistent.  Homefront certainly isn't a terrible game, but with the amount of quality games available today, why play a thoroughly mediocre one?
723	0	a	  Homefront was a pretty standard FPS game. It did not invent anything new or did any wonders storywise. But it showed potential that could spawn a good series. It was smooth, short and bereft of bugs. Homefront the Revolution is a sub par shooter which tries to follow in Homefront's steps but fails miserably. It sports an open world which is just a bunch of large areas tagged together. The story is standard run of the mill affair and there is a new and kind of fun gun customization on the run.  It would have been received somewhat better if it launched with far fewer bugs. It is an average game which is hidden behind a plethora of crashing, screen freezes, excessive lag and loads of bugs. On top of that it sports a season pass while trying to imitate other AAA titles.  Please stay clear of Homefront: The Revolution as in its current situation, it's not worth the asking price.
2307	1	a	I'll be making a quick short review on this from only 1 hour of gameplay as it seems enough to get into the game, I dont remember much from playing the original Homefront years ago but I sure did enjoy this one.  My opinions on Homefront: The Revolution -Really nice graphics, almost like a real cinematic movie. -The intro to the game is alot to take in as so much is happening already, you are a recruit afterall. -Distinctive urban enviroments and gameplay makes the game unique. -Characters have a personality making some of the gamescenes interesting   Also the best thing in this game is the Timesplitters 2 Easter egg, brings me back as a kid, amazing honestly.
2309	1	a	Once again, people are disrespecting a perfectly good game, for no good reason.   If you like the Farcry style of FPS games, you will like Homefront: The Revolution just fine.  In fact, I found it easier to immerse myself into because it is grittier, more 'realistic' in terms of weapons, environment, styles and AI.   The phone and menu navigation is a little unwieldy, but that just adds to the realism of trying to juggle a rifle and a phone.  I've not had an experience like this since FarCry 2 and I am really enjoying it.  This has been on my list since it came out, but I hesitated, wanting to give time for bugs to be worked out. But I meant to get it before now.  So when Steam offered a free weekend of play, I couldn't pass. I bought it after only a few hours of play.  Deep Silver has made some of my all time favorite games and they always get preferential treatment so I will make a gift of this game to a couple of friends to show my support.
724	0	a	------------ Update  Well...it´s runnning now. Not doing well, but running. Some Crashes from time to time.  Is it worth buying it? No. Maybe in a weak sales-moment...   -------------  Don´t buy this now!  The performance is hell and graphic settings don´t make a difference.  (i5 2500k, GTX 970, 8GB) Savegames are easily corrupted. So you are able to play again and again.  The game crashes after ~15 min of gameplay when saving after a cutscene  (Mission 'Welcome to the resistance') You are able to fix this by creating a  new user in windows. The username must not have any chraracters other then a-z. (e.g. â ê ö ü will crash the game when saving).  And don´t think of 'starting as user'...wont´t work.  I spend more time on installation, patching and crashing then on playing.  Wait for the next patch. Or the next two, three or four....
725	0	a	  I think this is genuinely a good game (it certainly helps that I like the gameplay). It's a shame it is so badly optimized, and that it's so full of bugs. It crashes constantly for me, and it runs at 45 FPS on my GTX 970. Changing the settings doesn't impact the framerate at all. To put it simply, it's a ♥♥♥♥ port, and I'm glad I played this during the free weekend and didn't have to pay for it.
2311	1	a	This game wasn't nearly as bad as people said it was. The game isn't as optimized as it could be, but it is fun eventhough its formula is not original by any means. Gun play is solid enough with mouse and keyboard but steer clear of using a controller as this is where it gets clunky. Overall I enjoyed the experience. By no means is it the best game in the world but given its rough development, I was pleasantly surprised to see that it was as good as it was. I would only recommend buying this on sale.
726	0	a	Awful story line, awful missions, awful side quests. The main mission and the plot can be extended and filled with more interesting stuff, incuding fights in developed urban areas(green zone) or on the airships which can make people feel comfortable compared to the tiring 'wasteland' style in the end. Every character is dumbass. The characters presented neither side missions nor interesting deveploment during the main missions, meaning you don't really feel anything about them except:'stupid''crazy''dumbass'.
727	0	a	It is fun. Die very fast. Lots of bugs. Txt msgs that wont go away. Hard to get to strike points. Id wait for the bugs to get shot over the wall.
728	0	a	  Good weapon mod system Interesting idea for a game.  Terrible AI, often they were oblivious even with my weapon drawn walking up to stab them in the face. Buggy....In the time spent playing crashed 2 times, had the game bug out upon alt+tabbing out, and fallen through the map a few times as well.  I made it as far as claiming 100% of the first 2 zones you are given access to, but after falling through the world upon map transition again I've decided to give up and play something less buggy.
729	0	a	Great game but it's way to buggy and unstable. Idk why devs would release a game like this, if they waited a bit longer and fixed the FPS bugs and optimised it, it'd probably get tonnes more sales and higher ratings. But whatever, I guess they don't like money.
730	0	a	As of 1.06 (August 9th, 2016) there's still an absurd amount of bugs and glitches - Varying from massive graphical artifacts, animations going nuts to triggers not working. There's a decent game in there, but it's really not worth the effort reaching it at this point.
731	0	a	Spending money on bacterial disinfectant to splash at your eyes is a more fun experience than playing this.
2313	1	a	Homefront: The Revolution is an underrated shooter with brisk open-world conquest, proficient weapons and engaging mechanics. Although the story is flimsy, major characters hold it together. Set in Philadelphia, the game focuses on an underground resistance group fighting the occupying North Korean forces. The Goliath vehicle (from Homefront 1) returns, but players must clumsily escort it because, sadly, they cannot command it. Story missions are rough, especially those near the weak ending.  This is a sandbox game, first and foremost. The initial world building is not as good as its predecessor, but the world design and gameplay are much better. Players will shoot and sneak their way through a few sizable levels. The basic goal is to capture ‘Strike Points’ in each level and retake America one piece at a time.  There are two Zone types—Red and Yellow. Red Zones are warzones with a heavy ‘Nork’ presence that shoot on sight. Airships slowly patrol above and you do not want to get caught in their spotlight. Stealth is encouraged initially and, after gaining sufficient ground, additional resistance soldiers make the levels safer. Yellow Zones are smaller residential locations that encourage hit-and-run tactics. These tend to use more vertical space and utilize cameras to keep civilians in line. Stealth is easier because you can blend into the crowd. After winning enough respect, civilians will riot which also reduces danger.   The difference between each area is refreshing, even though many tasks are similar. You will hack antennas, capture strongholds, recharge generators with motorbikes, and even do some basic parkour navigation. Some tasks are random, like saving civilians or killing officials. It is strange that many Strike Points can be captured while enemies are still hostile nearby, but this makes for rapid conquest. The two different Zone types provide natural pacing and satisfying conquest  Sadly, Revolution has its share of bugs. Problems include: not being able to complete side jobs, grenades falling through the ground, and enemies disappearing. My character even flew high into the air, after getting off a motorbike that was barely moving. Also, after capturing one Strike Point, the game spawned me inside a shelf. Performance is not the best—with a few late-game crashes—although it still looks good on medium settings with changing weather and a day-night cycle. The game is not technically polished, but it is quite playable.  Using CryEngine, the AI has familiar routines and similar problems. Sometimes they walk into walls, float above the ground, or forget they got shot. Fortunately, they also have many positives. They react appropriately to dead bodies, sounds, and thrown projectiles. Toss a Molotov near soldiers and survivors will search the approximate source location. Cause a large explosion and Norks will swarm that area, reducing the threat elsewhere. The AI does not cheat; they move and shoot based on your last position. The mostly-clever, partially-glitchy AI makes for decent action.   There are several effective stealth options, including a melee takedown, silenced pistol, and proximity devices. RC cars can be driven short distances to produce chaos elsewhere; you can even drive them under vehicles undetected. There is a great selection of guns, including a powerful sniper and an excellent assault rifle. Enemies and vehicles have weak spots, so positioning and accuracy is important. The Hack grenades will temporarily turn autonomous vehicles against the Norks and these devices are also used for puzzles. It is a shame that you can only carry two primary weapons but they have alternate modes (e.g. the crossbow turns into a flamethrower) and it usually isn’t far to change loadouts.  Multiplayer is co-operative only, although this is not a bad thing. Players become a resistance soldier and complete missions across the same zones from the single player. You might escort vehicles, breach strongholds or rescue prisoners. Stealth functions well, in fact the co-op plays much the same as the solo mode. There are skills, outfits, and boosts—they could have been part of the single player to add more depth. There are only 6 missions (more are planned) that take around 10 minutes to complete. You typically buy crates to refill consumables, and the RNG Gods will dictate whether you get a useful hack device or a 10% XP boost. It’s a grind without enough content, and there is barely anybody playing just weeks after launch.   Homefront: The Revolution will provide around 15-20 hours of decent action in the single player, assuming players capture all Strike Points. What makes it successful is in how it presents the world and how it provides small encounters with different objectives. There are barely any drawn-out battles, and tasks can be completed without firing a shot. Players can progress through zones in any direction, avoiding snipers or destroying enemy patrols, and the encounter spots are rarely the same. It’s a sandbox game, so the experience relies heavily on letting you have fun in bite sized pieces. The game achieves this more often than not. Homefront: The Revolution is far from perfect, as numerous bugs, AI quirks, poor story missions, and performance issues hold it back. But damned if it isn’t enjoyable to enter a hostile sandbox and have it completely under control after an hour or two of competent shooting. 7 / 10
2315	1	a	Much like Farcry, but without uplay and Ubisoft. Pretty dank game if i say so myself.
2317	1	a	An urban warfare variation of the Far Cry formula with a better level design, but overall more clunky.  Pros: - Good level design, especially some environmental puzzles in some of the strike points (think towers in Far Cry). They get better as you progress in the game. My favourite one: Hospital where you have to find medical supplies before unlocking the point. - The city is a much better environment for the Far Cry formula than a jungle or mountains, in my opinion. In Far Cry I found the travelling between bases and towers boring, here it's fun and you have to be wary of your surroundings all the time. - Vaulting over obstacles and mantling on higher platforms is used naturally everywhere - The writing in the later parts of the game - Voice acting - Diverse environments. From rich villas to gassed and desolate industrial zones  Cons: - The shooting is not very satisfying and some weapons behave strangely. A fully upgraded silenced SMG has more recoil than a LMG, for example - Rudimentary stealth with few options. Stealth is required as in some maps if you raise an alarm, the game spawns soldiers infinitely, unless you hide. But the tools you have at your disposal are lacking. - The movement system (vaulting, mantling) is quite slow, the PC feels like an elephant. Fast movement feels more fluid, see Dishonored or Titanfall - Writing in the earlier parts of the game is cliched and quite bad. I feel it gets better in later parts, where the situation is more desperate. - Some bugs (wrongly placed objects, levitating NPCs, even a show-stopping bug in the main quest, that was luckily solved by reloading)  Overall I recommend the game if the idea of a Far Cry formula in a city appeals to you. Just be ready for some clunkiness and a few bugs.
2319	1	a	The graphic is awesome. CryEngine really delivers it. Honestly not even as bad as people claim it is. The single player is really fun and this is one of few FPSs where you are not invincible. You actually have to know when to fight and when to run. It's not the best shooter I have played it but it's the best recent single player shooter for sure.
2321	1	a	Mostly negative WTF ?  Best game i ever played, tbh there was some little bugs here and there and some frame drops too but story is fu**ing AWESOME! 11/10 . Amazing game !!!
2323	1	a	Ran into issues like cant mount a bike. Some capture points are greyed out forever. AI is a bit stupid at times.  But overall i've been hooked to the game
744	0	a	To be completely honest, this game isn't up to par with the original game. Sure, it looks nice, and the freeplay environment is cool, but somehow, they managed to make the gunplay worse than the original game's. Converting weapons on the fly is cool and everything, but realisticly, it's too fast and the changes that are made are sometimes quite rediculous. Also some conversions are just ♥♥♥♥. Convert your sniper rifle into a firework cannon? Nope, do not do that. You'll have better luck with a grenade or you know, an actual rocket launcher. The online game is pretty just the missions from singleplayer(sure they're different missions, but they play out the same. No freeplay online, its just mission after mission and theres really not that many missions to play. Also, the online is dead already, so don't expect to actually get to play online if that ♥♥♥♥ Bottom line, I bought the game to see if it was really as ♥♥♥♥♥♥ as everyone said it was. I can confirm it's pretty bad, but probably not quite as bad as everyone else says. Buy this game if you want to play another Far Cry esque game and would like it in some 'The United States has been invaded and you, the most patriotic of patriots would rather die than let those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Koreans win' kind of perspective. 8/10 Concept wise, 3/10 gameplay wise, 0/10 multiplayer, and 1/10 for optimsation and polish. Overall, I'd say its about a 3.5/10
745	0	a	Let me preface this by saying I do not think this game is bad. Homefront: The Revolution has a good foundation, and with great potential in my opinion, but almost nothing is built on it in the end.   This game is an open-world FPS title that has you play as Ethan Brady, a fresh recruit for the Resistance, fight against the KPA who hold control of Philadelphia. This game however never takes full advantage of its alternate history setting and the fact that it is an open world game. Retaking the city is pretty lackluster and repetitive. You can expect to be doing the same thing for one Zone for most of the others. You do Main missions, raise the 'Hearts &amp; Minds' percentage to 100%, do another mission to win the zone, then repeat.  I can forgive that if the rest of the game had something else to makes it stand out, but besides the weapon conversions (which are interesting, but ultimately clunky), this game has no such thing. The story is very weak, shallow, and fails to make me empathize with the Resistance. Characters lack depth and act predictably throughout the story. And while gunplay is decent, your arsenal is small and what you play with from the first zone is likely what you'll use for the rest of the game.  The final nail in the coffin for me though was how unrewarding all of it was. Most everything outside of main missions and set activities does almost nothing at all. If you killed a platoon of KPA troops nothing is gained. If you decide to capture all strongholds in a zone you only have Tech Points for changing existing weapons. All you can do is earn money, do the same activities, and finish missions. That's all the game really wants you to do.  The game can have it's moments due to the fact how you tackle each task is left for you to decide, but it's really not enough for the asking priceof $40. The game overall feels incredibly average and sometimes even below average later on in the story. Even if it's on sale I would consider looking elsewhere.  Tl;Dr - Overwhelmingly average Open-world FPS with missed potential. Not worth the price unless on (a very good) sale.
746	0	a	 Not a great game yet
747	0	a	Considering the state at which they released this 'gem' to have this many DLC 's available so soon after release is a punch to the gut.......   dont buy this and please dont support this new business model of push crap to release and filling your pockets with dlc's
748	0	a	  'The credits began with an apology'  Homefront: The Dance Dance Revolsution is a video game about NORTH KOREA conquering the world through electronics and military hardware sales.  North Korea, in the Homefries Timeline, is, at the 1960.. 80s .. starting from the 1970s, was a more advanced economic/industrial power than the USA and JApAN COMBINED.  That made me laugh so hard I got dizzy.  By the time I woke up from nearly blacking out, I was being tortured by the Fictional North Korean Army that conquered America while the entire world sat on its hands and watched. Then, I was being tortured by the AMERICAN REVOLUTIONARIES of the game who joked about how ♥♥♥♥ing tortured I was about to get and how ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ dead I was about to be. Cool introduction to the heroes.  There are no sympathetic characters in this game. They are all horrible monsters. When they aren’t, they’re still annoying charicatures that barely symbolize peace, cruelty, and justice.  The game itself is serviceable: You shoot enemies, they flinch and go down. It’s incredibly repetitive, and liberating the city becomes a waste of time quickly enough, divided into free fire Red zones, and the slightly more interesting Yellow zones that blend stealth and sabotage (terrorism) against your oppressors. Weapons are fairly interesting, able to break them down into variants that wildly change their behavior, but nothing you’ve not seen before. You have everything from a pistol to the rocket propelled gurnade. Most interesting is the HACKING GRENADE TOOL, which flips the allegiance of enemy robots against them. The most fun thing in the game by far!  The game sucks patriotic ♥♥♥♥ the whole way through against a jingoistic nightmare.   (played the game during its free period)
749	0	a	I have to say.. due to all the bugs that exist within the game. 1 would think this is in beta state.. i say beta because it isnt terrible but there are alot. The lack of multiplayer base for this game literally within the first week of release tells me that this game will end up just like starwars battlefront. Flopped... an example is today.. sunday at 5 pm eastern.. i went looking for games and didnt find a single 1.. tells ya something about the future state of this game in general. story is ok but nothing to speak of. truthfully listening to the leaders of the resistance give talks to the resistance in single player was really eh. didnt feel really all that hardcore to resist haha.. some would say the story itself is short.. maybe not as short as the first game.. but short enough that i hammered threw it in a few hours.. so truthfully i went in really wanting to love this game and deep silver pre-released it to early.. really half did everything in the game.. and truthfully the hype everyone sees when watching the trailer.. the game didnt live up to. its a shame really as iv invested to many hours to request a refund and am stuck with the game. on the plus.. i wont have to spend any more money on dlcs/expensions as deepsilver kinda lost my business. really liked the company till now and always supported their games. shame but oh well.. sorry for any errors as i am writing this really quick before heading out the door. my advice is if you aint sure , give it a go as you may enjoy it but i personally wasnt impressed. games worth maybe 30 bucks at best at its current state. and truely feel it needs a way better story line.. but to each their own.
750	0	a	Agreed with everyone else. There's an overly long into with no interaction and a pretty lackluster experiene waiting for you at the end of it. Performance is okay- there's some hitching here and there but mostly smooth. The FOV is sickeninly narrow and I did not see a slider. It's possible I just didn't look hard enough though. Guns don't feel good and it's just an all around average to bad game. Try it for free then uninstall after 30min.
2325	1	a	I enjoyed it. Shooting feels solid. Stealth works solidly. Story is ok.  Sure, for me there were some graphical glitches here adn there, for a short 16 hour experience i found it to be alright.
756	0	a	I wanted so badly for this to be good. Sadly, the title should've given it away; this is Homefront: The Revolution, not Homefront 2.  The first Homefront was a totally underrated FPS. It was linear, yes. The gunplay and mechanics were quite standard, yes. But there was a unique setting, some brilliant writing, and one moment every level where the only response I had was 'Wow.' Some of those moments still sit with me - in the gut, not in the brain. The same way Spec Ops: The Line still does.  But The Revolution does not have those moments. It's tutorial driven. Despite the half open world it still feels very linear. The story is worse. The writing is obtuse. The game went too cerebral. They thought about it too much and overplanned. Micromanaged. It goes to your head instead of your heart.  The graphics are ok - they weren't going to be the thing to make or break this game anyway. The controls are quite bad, mostly because there are some very important keys you can't re-assign (like holstering your weapon). Stealth is constantly suggested but impossible to actually pull off. The open world aspect felt more like a chore than anything approaching fun. The balance of money and points for upgrades is totally off: there's far too little early on and far too much later.  The whole system is buggy, especially around achievements and saving progress. The only reliable way to move forward is by sprinting back to a store to get a check point after accomplishing the optional objectives. If you don't and the game crashes while you're out in the world exploring you'll have to try to remember what you did and repeat it all.  The multiplayer is worth mentioning because I'm a sucker for co-op, especially with RPG elements. But this was terrible. The skills you unlock don't usually matter and it takes too long to get them (although it's worth noting that there are one or two that are totally overpowered compared to the rest). The different classes don't really complement each other. And finally, there isn't nearly enough content. Once you beat all the maps one time there isn't a strong incentive to keep playing.  I'm glad that they got this game out, but creating a game is very different than creating a  good  game. The latter is far more difficult, and requires a level of care and polish that simply isn't present in The Revolution.  Hopefully Homefront will get a true sequel one day. I'd enjoy that.
2327	1	a	The main complaints about this game are about the optimization.  I have a fairly powerful computer, and it runs fine, albeit i turned a few settings from ultra to high (poor me).  There are occasional lag spikes, once every 10 minutes i'd say, but it's not game breaking at all.  Seeing as I'm not a whiny baby, i realize that optimization is something that will be fixed in a month or two through patches, and if its not, THEN i'd be worried, but until then, we're going to look at the game from a non technological standpoint.  My only complaint so far is that i feel like i was thrown into the action a little too fast. Not enough intro plot for me, but an hour in, i was very comfortable with how the game was going.  Gameplay wise, it's similar to farcry.  Liberate zones to increase your support in the region, disable North Korean infrastructure, and gain the 'hearts and minds' of the people, to bring more people to the revolution. This is done by capturing special objectives and areas, like observation points, patrol areas, securable areas, saving civilians, broadcasting revolution propaganda in place of North korean propoganda, and a few other ways as well. The hearts and minds system is a nice refresher to this style of gameplay.   The combat feels good. You have the choice between stealthing, brute force, or hit and run tactics using tech you aquire in the game.  For example, a remote car explosive device could be driven under an armored patrol vehicle and detonated, destroying it and the soldiers patrolling with it, letting you stay at a safe distance and leave quickly.  The guns feel good, the sounds are nice and even on hardened you can take down norks with a good headshot, or a few body shots.  The most interesting part of this would probably be the weapons customization.  For your first weapon, you are given a pistol and an SMG conversion. To apply this conversion, you remove the slide of the pistol, insert the lower into the SMG upper and load the magazine, all of this being a very nice animation you actually see in game.  You can also switch out AR15 uppers, shotgun parts, and pretty much anything else you want on the fly.  I'll probably update this review once i've completed the game, but so far, i can safely say most of the compaints and negative reviews are based upon the game not being properly optimized for the PC, which is understandable, but not enough to give it a negative review in my opinion.
2329	1	a	  Homefront TR is a surprisingly fun game! After all the bad reviews I expected a lame, buggy, and broken game. What I got was a competent, interesting, and well-made game. The environments are well laid out and visually interesting, the main story moves at a nice pace, all the grindy side content is avoidable, and the shooting and stealth mechanics are fine.  Clearly you could play better games like Wolfenstein or Doom or Deus Ex, but Homefront TR is actually a fun game, worth picking up when it's on sale.  Disclosure: I played this during the free weekend, and only got about half-way through. I'll buy it when the price goes down further.
2331	1	a	   Homefront : The Revolution
2333	1	a	  good game .loving it .don't think i will have it finished by tomorrow. so ill be buying it soon
758	0	a	  Disclaimer: I tried this as part of the Steam Free Weekend. I own and have finished the original Homefront (under Wine), which I actually didn't mind (despite its flaws).  I really wanted to like Homefront: The Revolution too. And I do... to a point. Unfortunately, there's also a lot not to like. It's a shame too, since it feels like given a few more months of work, The Revolution could have been a real winner.   What I liked:  - The idea for the story is something I can get behind. However it wasn't well explained, and there were gaps missing which were left to the imagination.  - It's an open world FPS, like modern Far Cry games, Dying Light, Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor, etc. I don't mind that they took the series in a new direction, although I was surprised.  - The artwork, voice acting, etc. were (for the most part) top notch.  - No in-game nagging for DLC content. There was actually no mention of DLC at all in-game. Good.  - Hidden Time Splitters 2 game, available from Extras under the main menu once unlocked.   What I disliked:  - Bugs. Bugs everywhere! Let's see...  I fell through the floor a few times. I once got stuck in the level causing me to need to restart from a checkpoint. Enemies sometimes fell through the floor after they died. There is a part where you need to stand in line, but the people in front of you get stuck and you can't pass - you have to reload a save (twice, in my case) to continue, with no ability to skip a lengthy cut scene. There was plenty of AI pathing issues. Enemies in the distance would spawn and de-spawning whenever they felt like it (even when looking right at them) making sniping from any significant distance useless. Some jobs could not be achieved if they were not attempted early in the game. Some achievements only activated upon closing the game, leading me to retry things I unknowingly already achieved.  At one point the game loaded a checkpoint without me telling it to (and without me dying). The game also crashed to the desktop multiple times. One time the game would not show anything on screen at launch (but the process was running in the background and had to be killed off through Task Manager). Explosives could be selected when you had none, which caused strange hand animations suggesting the player was carrying something invisible.  One issue I found one time was that I was unable to get back on a motorcycle because I accidentally drove it a few centimetres outside of the mission area, even though I was standing right next to it and there was no other motorcycle nearby. At another point I had to load a previous checkpoint because an audio loop (beeping indicating the close proximity to a Resistance stash) wouldn't stop playing once the stash was found and I had walked away.  Consider the game beta quality at best. It's really no wonder the game received such bad reviews in the face of so many problems. I didn't even try multiplayer!  - Still no sign of the promised GNU/Linux support. If the game had this at launch, I would have purchased it despite the bugs.  - Inability to fast travel to any point to the map which has been captured. Travelling to try to finish off uncompleted jobs is frustrating. Selecting a destination on the map is not remembered when you die and re-spawn. Further, the map is not accessible on the motorcycle.  - The store menu is a pain. If you want to purchase 10 consumable items (such as explosives), you need to select the explosive, confirm the purchase, and repeat this 10 times. I didn't even notice how to get to the job menu until late in the game due to the bad layout. If you don't specifically look for the active jobs menu, you won't notice it. You can also die looking at the menu, even though the game audio has stopped and you are in a single-player campaign.  - Gun-play needs work. It's more frustrating than it should be. If you're using the shotgun, there's one guy left nearby and you need to reload, the game won't let you insert just one or two shells and fire away - you need to fill it up completely with shells before the reload animation will stop and you can fire. This caused me to die on many occasions.  If an airship spots you, enemies will spawn from all around you almost instantly - even from areas you know you just cleared out. This forces you to play in a trigger-happy style, but the gun-play is not well geared for it.  Grenade and cover systems are horrible for keyboard+mouse. There is also no “Hold to duck key binding option, so duck can only be toggled.  - Dying is frustrating. You won't generally lose much progress, but repawning takes too long. When you die, the game is unresponsive for a few seconds, eventually some text slowly fades in telling you to press enter. If you press enter too early (ie. before the text has fully faded in) the key press won't register. And you can't press or click any other button to continue - only enter will work. This causes me to constantly bash the key in frustration! Next, the game will start loading the level again. On my overclocked i7-6700k, that takes another 10 or so seconds I guess.  For me, this is perhaps the single most frustrating part of the entire game. If you die in a single player campaign, you should always be able to get back in the action immediately.  - No Crossfire support. It's 2016, and this isn't a Bethesda title (which typically run amazingly well even on a single GPU anyway). If you want to call yourself a AAA developer, Crossfire is the expectation. I played the game at 2560x1440 on a Fury X with basically everything maxed out, and I was getting anything from just under 40 FPS to just under 60 FPS. That's significantly worse than running Far Cry Primal on a single Fury X. Of course, Far Cry Primal can use Crossfire anyway.  - Lack of originality. The story was fine (although the last few minutes were somewhat painful), but the general game mechanics (capturing structures, unlocking parts of the map, finding hidden loot, etc. all feels a bit too familiar. This isn't in itself a problem provided there is also something new brought to the table, or the overall approach is polished and improved in some way. Unfortunately that just hasn't happened here, and actually a lot of the similarities to comparable titles seem like a step backwards. Obviously Ubisoft is a massive company with a lot of experience in making these types of games, so I'm not at all surprised that Homefront hasn't turned out better than a Far Cry experience. However Homefront developers should have anticipated this and provided something new to compensate.  - The original Homefront advertised the game with a metal compilation CD including tracks such as a Metalica cover by Periphery. Sadly, that never received much promotion, is no longer available and doesn't even appear to have been attempted for The Revolution.  - The textures all seem to be high resolution and generally look great, but occasionally I came across something strange. eg. a truck that was completely green, including the tires. The shading was drawn correctly, but possibly the textures were missing. It's unclear if that was another bug or the artwork was unfinished.  - Parkour really isn't a strong point here. The Revolution has it, but feels very limited compared to what the Far Cry and Dying Light universes offer. Climbing a building is generally a matter of walking around the outside of it (and nearby buildings) looking for a wooden ramp, as opposed to trying to perform risky manoeuvres from a great height. It all feels very dumbed down. The game also imposes significant impact damage if you fall.  - No benchmark mode.  In summary, the game feels like a poor-man's Far Cry. It's frustrating, both because the game causes you frustration, and also because the game feels like it was very close to becoming something much greater than it turned out to be.
2335	1	a	  Well... It's not too bad. It's an average open world shooter. You might be into this style of game but i pretty much get bored of it.  I only really played this because of three reasons, one being i have a brand new 1060 graphics card which makes the game gorgeous looking so it gave it a good work out and the other being that there's an easter egg that contains two FULL levels of god damn TIMESPLITTERS 2 that works with mouse and keyboard. Oh... and it was free because of the free weekend thing so, why not? But i stayed for Timesplitters and i wouldnt have given Homefront a second look if it wasnt for that easter egg.  I mean, it has some nice ideas and some pretty great scenery, but it's just... eh, you've played it before. Just imagine Far Cry 3 and 4 in an urban environment and that's pretty much this. I guess i recommend the game but i'd wait for a discount maybe? Just don't buy it too expensive, like.  Anyway, speaking of that easter egg. Hey, see that Dambuster, former Free Radical i'm sure? You see that arcade cabinet? That's what i want in a shooter, that's fun. Open world stuff is overdone, i want to pick up a shooter that's Maybe your teasing ports of Timesplitters 2 and 3 on PC or a remaster or something. I want a shooter that doesnt take itself seriously and Timesplitters is 10/10 in my book. So... you know, please release them on PC? You know you want to.
2337	1	a	I'm not sure how much staying power the game has, but as an in-the-moment sort of the game, it's very fun. There are still a few bugs present, but if you wait even longer than I did, and the developer continues to refine their game, it wouldn't be unwise to purchase it for even full price or on sale.  As for the game itself, think Far Cry gameplay filtered through Call of Duty and Metro, visually stark and atmospheric but tonally fatuous like an action movie. Can't say I approve of the overt jingoism either, as it turns to inanity a few times. Guess it's an American thing, like that guy running for governer, firing a minigun in his campaign ad.
2339	1	a	I had a chance to look into it for around 100 minutes. Not a single perfomance/ai/what so ever issue. It was running smooth, everything worked great.  great atmosphere, nice job on everything. I really don't get the hate
2341	1	a	I gave it a whirl and really enjoyed it. Is it top shelf? No. Is it the best game I've ever played? Nope, but given the subject matter, setting, and the freedom to do things however you want I think it gets close to something I've been craving for a long time.  I think it's what it could be once the kinks are worked out. I'm tired of pretty shooters that are more about how the water and grass looks. I'm tired of rail shooters that make you look in the background and wish that you could go there in the game. This game is not perfect but it stirs something in me. It makes me hope there is more to come.  With the 50% discount this game is now part of my library. You should NOT spend $60 on this game but for the first time in a long time I'm excited to see where this game goes or the impact it has on other games in the genre.  Some have mentioned that the game lacks the subtleties of other 'chose your own path' games. I totally agree but the framework is there. I wish there was more emphasis on that kind of game play too but if you take the time to play around a bit you can make it as epic or straight forward as you want really.  It's definitely the fault of the current game design that leads you towards the easiest options. I don't enjoy run and gun in single player games. I like the option for silent kills, sneaking through the sewers, using the environment, or flying over the wall on a flaming motorcycle while riding a wheely like Evel Knievel. These take time to set up and you could have just mowed them all down in half the time but you don't have to. All of those options exist but only on the harder difficulties do you start searching them out. Again, not a perfect game but you can kind of set the 'fun level' for it however you see fit.  The more I play Resistance Mode the more I like it! As a matter of fact, I will try to follow up on my review after I finish the campaign but I haven't stopped playing Resistance Mode, lol! The only advice I'd give is to slow play the campaign. Don't go out and take over everything as fast as you can. Enjoy the setting and use the environment whenever you can to take out the Norks in the most epic way possible. You won't regret it!
2343	1	a	I'm really confused what is all about ALL of the negative reviews, game is just great !   Average 90fps with my old i73770K &amp; GTX 980ti. Great story, gameplay &amp; graphics.  *** If you're fan of FarCry this game will be for you ***
2345	1	a	this game is hella cool...dont understand all the hate, i love the farcry game style and it runs great on my computer plus got it for 15 bucks...well worth it!!
2347	1	a	Great Stuff!  Atmospheric, moody and enjoyable. Satisfying weapons, fantastic derelict waistlands to manoeuvre around. Airships that make your heart jump a beat when they let-off their 'War of the World' type spot alert sound when youve been tagged.  Considering your part of the resistance in the revolution, it's true to its form and is what it should be.  Fortunately for me it runs buttery smooth getting v-synced 60fps @ 1080p with all settings maxed - on GTX 1080 (Aorus X7 DT V6 CF1).  It's a shame some are digruntled over this game, however I personally find there's fun to be had as otheres have also mentioned. It might not float everyone's boat, but I hope to play many hours more when I get the time off from work.
2349	1	a	I cant speak to how this game was at launch. I only recently purchased it.  But....  For how well the game engine runs today and the amount of content it provides, gameplay, etc... AND the sale price of $11 - $15 (for game and season pass). This game is a great buy.  It has its quirks, like cut and paste characters sometimes in very close proximity, and a few others, but for the price I paid and how well it runs (Dec 27, 2016) it was well worth it.  Recommended to people who like Far Cry / Fallout 4 / freedom (open world / open zone) types of games. Its kind of a mix of all those games.  I do feel for those that paid the full price for game + season pass (and launch issues), but so far (today) the game seems to run great and well worth the $11 - $14.  
2351	1	a	It's a decent game. The plot is unbelievable, the voice acting is spotty at times, and the weapons aren't anything new.  It's a blast, though. You should definitely get it when it goes on sale.
2353	1	a	Could run better, but game looks great, story is cool, open world reminds me of farcry2 (which I actually enjoyed). Free weekend was worth it for this company as it allowed me to play the game, and once I had I decided it was definitely worth 26$
2355	1	a	I don't understand why this game was ♥♥♥♥ on so much. It's a massive improvement from the first homefront, and the game itself is good. Decent story, beautiful graphics, and fun gameplay.
2357	1	a	Played over the free weekend and loved it. Will be buying. I was on the fence and noticed a couple of wierd clipping bugs but love the game. A cross between metro, homefront 1, and Farcry. Havent quite got the hang on the bike riding but will hopefully get it by the end game.
761	0	a	  Seems like it could be fun but shooting mechanics and combat are so simple, uninspired, boring and depressing that I had to uninstall it.
2359	1	a	I see I finally got my Freedoim Fighters 2, sorta.   I don't get the hate for this game. It's another typical Ubisoft game, with a lot of the same mechanics as Far Cry 3 and 4, but whatever; it's still fun and that's why I buy games.  I also prefer games where I make my own missions and do my own thing in an open world, so this game scratches that itch. It's worth picking up on sale, in my opinion.
762	0	a	Its pretty boring, its a bad Far Cry clone.
2361	1	a	It has its issues but i enjoyed the ride.
763	0	a	Optimization is awful. My PC is certainly not low end and even with this rig I get 20 FPS at best. The controls are fidgety, like 2006 basic controls. You turn your vision even slightly and the whole world becomes a blur. I can not, and will not recommend this game. It is not passable for a title developed by a studio in 2016. It's incomplete and should not have been released yet. £39.99 gone to waste.
2363	1	a	It took a while for patching to make the game playable, but after 1.7 it went from unplayable to very playable. It's not a perfect game by any stretch, but I highly recommend it.   Note that i am a fan of the core Far Cry series, FC 2,3,4 as well as Arma. Those are the kinds of games I like to play.  Here's why Homefront The Revolution is a good game, for me... and maybe you...  1. They nailed philly and post invasion occupation. If you ever wanted to star in your own 'Reds' movie, this is it.   2. The whole premise, which starts with the Military in the US being disabled via hacking, is within the realm of possibility, say 30 years down the road.  3. The technological advanced machines the Koreans have in the game, if you project say 20-30 years ahead, are entirely plausable.  4. The enjoyment of this game, the immersion of it, went way up when I shut the Mini-map off. Recommend you do the same. It's all in settings and is easy to do.  5. The sound in the game is pretty good, sounds of occupation. It grows as the population is stirred up. Really adds to the immersion. I like to shut off the music unless I am really feeling 'cinematic'. But normally, I like the music off which adds immersion IMHO.  6. I have not finished the game but I am several hours into it. DON'T JUDGE THE GAME BY THE FIRST YELLOW AND RED ZONE you work. The game gets increasingly more exciting after a while. You will feel like you are a fugitive from justice.  7. There are a ton of side missions to do along the way, or stick with the main thread. I started my playing with medium difficulty and hud on, focusing on the main mission 'cause I was getting my butt kicked. Then I stopped the game, and began a new one, this time on hardest, no mini map (love it off!), and pursue all teh side missions.    And so this is why I enjoy playing this game.  There are some things I wish were better however: a. You can upgrade your guns, bombs etc... but the way you obtain them is by accumulating cash (or something called 'KPA points').   The whole thing about using cash for weapon upgrades just strikes me as totally non-immersive. Look, you're in a rag-tag group of resistance fighters, where you and your copatriots live in poverty... and you will become a big deal in teh resistence.,.. but you need money for weapons? I'd rather they use something like the 'renown' system found in silent hunter... if ya know what that is... they do use something called KPA points, but they can onl;y be used on certain items and not your main weapons.  This is not a fatal flaw, but one that just strikes me as silly each time I purchase an upgrade....  b. As a fan of the far cry series FC 2,3,4, the protagonist speaks a few words here and there in those games. Not a lot, but enough to feel like your character is a human. In Home Front, you are always silent, even when you woudl expect something to be said (I won't spoil it for you....).  This is not a major flaw as most of the time you are doing what freedom fighters do so well... and I suspect it was about budget, why we don't have that in the game. But just a little character talking on even rare occasions would have made the story more real.  Some have been critical of the story.. and it doesn't quite equal what you get in Far Cry ... still it plays a part in the journey and glues together the pieces in to a whole. I give the story a B.   ====================  Conclusion - as I said earlier - if you want to be in your own Reds movie (the original, not the sucky newer one...), and want to experience the feeling of taking back your community and your nation from an occupying force, I highly recommend this game for you.
764	0	a	Optimization is awful. My PC is certainly not low end and even with this rig I get 20 FPS at best. The controls are fidgety, like 2006 basic controls. You turn your vision even slightly and the whole world becomes a blur. I can not, and will not recommend this game. It is not passable for a title developed by a studio in 2016. It's incomplete and should not have been released yet. £39.99 gone to waste.
765	0	a	Cons: -Enemies are annoyingly bullet spongey -Characters have about as much character as a plate -silent protagonist fits  -the gun play is slower than a paraplegic going from New York to California -Ai is a person on every known drug to humanity Pros: -Hilarious graphical bugs -Rag doll may rival that of gta 4 -Customization is halfway decent -Stealth is a 7.8/10 it ok m8   All and all I give this game a 6/10 avoid like the bubonic plague(until it is safe to come out of the shelter)
766	0	a	No cloud saves and it's optimized very bad.
767	0	a	Not bad in terms of the idea of the game. However, they could have made this game so much better with the storyline. As well as, they should have worked better for an open-world game. It was the same thing over and over with taking over the bases and all that. The graphics weren't bad, but the glitches were terrible. I waited for this game sice the lasr Homefront and it was not worth it. I give this game 5/10. Wait for the price to drop.
2365	1	a	Solo campaign was good. (8 hours) Yellow Zones makes the shoot and run pretty fun. Attachment system is great.  Coop is horrible and short. No real point.  Great graphics. Some crashes and fps drop.  Beat it on free weekend.
768	0	a	VERY BORING this game is so incredibly repetitive, that just half way through the storyline, you begin to wonder how much longer till you can move on to the next Steam game in your wishlist. Even the main storyline missions become inconsequential and lame. About 3/4's of the game is running around liberating strong holds and doing little acts of charity. The strongholds would be interesting, but the AI mechanics is so bad that the enemies will just run straight into your line of fire and have no strategy except to Leeroy Jenkins you anytime youre noticed. The gun custimazation feature held promise, but failed to meet expectations. You end up unlocking all the gear and weapon attachments after just an hour of play, giving you nothing to want to work up to.  Also the Sniper attachment is absoluetly useless. The battle rifle with the sniper scope is so much better. If you want to play a game like this, but done the right way, go play Farcry instead 
769	0	a	Edited to include control method**  I always struggle to decide whether or not to pre-order. This is one of those times when I wish I hadn't.  The gameplay is actually fun if you're not looking for insane Action RPG style life ruining immersion, and it's a pretty great shooter with some fun mechanics (hacking, and modding weapons comes to mind in the first 2 hours I've so far played).  The trouble lies in what everyone else is saying too; which is that it's thus far very poorly optimized.  Running at 1440P.  System Specs: i7 6700K OC'ed to 4.7ghz EVGA GTX 980Ti FTW 6GB 16gigs of Vengeange LPX RAM at 3000mhz Controlled with M+KB (Corsair K70 RGB / Razer Deathadder)   And this game stutters and stumbles it's way through almost every graphical setting I've tried thus far. Maybe it will perform better once a patch or two is released but for now, for the price, it's a title that I think has a lot of promise. If you know what the game is going to be about. It might impress. Just wait a week or two to buy it.
770	0	a	No. Just no, I enjoyed to a degree the first Homefront game on the xbox, this appeared to be a complete 180 in comparison. However it's not, it's dull, it crashed twice on me, audio failed miseribly and gunplay is sorely lacking, sadly I cannot get a refund, as I did not buy through Steam and have clearly used my code, I do not suggest you buy this game, at least not yet.
771	0	a	Frame rate was fine for me but the game feels like a clunky version of Far Cry.
772	0	a	Pros: -Good graphics -Dense and interesting world -GREAT concept. WOLVERINES!  Cons: -Buggy, I get really mad if a bug stops me from completing objectives. It was a side mission but for me it's hard to continue on with that marker stuck there and there is nothing I can do. -Optimization is bad. Really bad, with a GTX 970 I should never drop below 30fps on normal settings. Also lots of stuttering. -Lack luster story. I just never really felt engaged or connected to the characters. -Open world is a bit if a stretch. Once you open a new area there is very little insentive to go back. -Gameplay is just OK. Was a little clunky, felt more like an rpg playstyle set in a FPS. Stealth could also use some work, at a certian point you learn to just run.  4/10 for now, I feel like it would be a 6/10 with enough patches, a lot of patches. 
2367	1	a	 Why hello, old friend!
778	0	a	Just refunded the game, the missing save function (the implemented autosave is a disaster!) is an absolute no-go !
779	0	a	Just refunded the game, the missing save function (the implemented autosave is a disaster!) is an absolute no-go !
2369	1	a	Awesome game! I don't know why there are so many bad reviews...I have had a breeze playing this game no lag or crashes. And I'm using a 4 year old system.
782	0	a	So I just Finish this game here is my review.  I did notice a lot of bugs while playing performance was bad at some points there was a lot of lag at points when doing a missions and ending side quests but I think everyone knows this.  So Pros and Cons.  Pros 1. the weapon systen is pretty sweet been able to change your gun to get the job done. 2. when taking over over the area you do see your allies all over fighting the KLPA so it feels like the missions you do does count. 3. the enviroment is pretty good it does give that feel that america has been taken over. 4. The Equitment in game was good gave me a lot of options on how to go about the missions  Cons 1. I do not like the bike the reason is just because there is a bike in game does not mean you need to make about 50% of the side quests need to be done with a bike that powers up a generator it gets really boring. 2. The Ai in game so many clones I felt like I was in Star wars the Clone wars....... 3.The Acting in this Game my God it felt like they went and got people that have never acted in there life it was so bad my head started to hurt listening to it. 4. The weapons I think they need to learn what recoil is my god it was so bad.  I will have to Give this a No for now it needs a lot of fixes and heaps more work this Game needed at least another year in Development way to soon to put it out it feels like a Alpha game might of been best to bring this out in EA and worked on it than people would of not been so negetive towards.
783	0	a	The game isn't bad but it's flawed and rushed. • Animation issue/clipping/slowdown • FOV max of 65 • Dumb as a rock AI, bad pathfinding. • Highly repeatitive gameplay pretty much taking what ubisoft do: Open world with 'tower'  As for the multiplayer • Copied the gear system from ME coop or DA:I you gain gear from random lootbox • Only 6 mission • Ugly AF character creation even more limited than division with only a couple face (mostly chinese or ugly face, especially for female character)  In all. Not worth 60e (lucky for me, only play 1/6 of the price), get it on a sale or when it go under half price otherwise it's not worth it. The game is a rushed mess that should have been delayed instead of being forced out as the game feel like playing a beta with lot of flaw.  TL;DR: Do not buy for full price, get it for sale or when it's under 25-20€/$, it's just a subpar game in all categorie it try to get into. Even for the coop it's not worth it as it's clunky and badly put in place with expensive lootcrate with 3 item (85% of the time worthless item such as booster)
784	0	a	   My experience with this game in a nutshell.  [i.imgur.com]   Seriously though, let me elaborate a bit. Everything starts with this dramatic and unbelievable story where North Korea sells tech to the US, and once they're the most trusted brand, they exploit a global backdoor to takeover the government. Whatever, I just wanna be a punk and kill soldiers. Anarchy forever, right?  Well, let's just say that the 'resistance' you're a part of it's actually a full blown military operation and everybody is a soldier... they just dress like punks because it looks cool, but they're not mere rebels. Everything is meticulously calculated and coordinated, they have high end tech, bases, recon squads, arsenals, tactical strategy planning... bloody hell, the only thing missing is having my fellow 'rebels' using the NATO alphabet for comms.  There is absolutely no sense of chaos and I don't feel like a rebel at all.    There's a HEAVY amount of handholding  (luckily you can disable most of it). NPCs talking through voice comms all the time, blabbering meaningless stuff that is supposed to make you feel tacticool, only reinforcing what I stated in the previous paragraph. I was quickly introduced to a bunch of mechanics (smartphone, weapon upgrading, camera, maps, etc.) and the only thing going through my head was 'is this really necessary? Why can't they just throw me into the action? Why don't they stop talking and stating the obvious? Why can't they let me figure things out by myself?'. It's so bad I got achievements for doing literally nothing... I went through a hole in the wall, boom, achievement. I'm not exaggerating.  AI is astoundingly dumb. Right after I got my first weapon, I went into the first underground area and killed everybody (I didn't know they were my allies).  The game will try to stop you by not letting you aim at the NPC's but you can kill them anyway ... you can even throw molotovs at them and THEY WON'T REACT AT ALL LMAO. I'd expect them to charge against me or at least run for their lives... nope, they just stand there and say their generic idle voicelines while you kill them. What happens if you throw a molotov towards an essential NPC? They burn and flap their arms and magically stop burning after a few secs; reach them and they'll talk to you like nothing happened.  Play on hard difficulty, disable the HUD clutter - doesn't matter,  game is ez af . Walk the streets, see a hot blondie, recruit her, headshot a NK guard from a long distance and no alarms will be rung. Enter a random building, see more snipars, patiently walk up the stairs and annihilate them at point-blank range, repeat a couple of times, BOOM, YOU WON, NEW BASE LIBERATED, PLAYER YOU'RE SUCH A WINNER AND HARDCORE SOLD--I MEAN REBEL, SINGLE-HANDEDLY WINNING THE W--REBELLION, JUST WOW.  The whole game is a giant scripted event that reeks of Call of Duty.   I wanted to take advantage of the free weekend and basically finish it for free, but it didn't hold my attention. Sound design is good, atmosphere is great, it's demanding enough to tax my rig... but it's casual garbage. Waste of 40GB.  Edit. it also crashes all the time.
785	0	a	Runs ok for the most part, loses frame rate a very annoying moment tho im sure this will be patched. For the most part the game is below average, the time spent on its development is clear in the gameplay as the combat feels like it would have been good 5-6 years ago.
786	0	a	Built around the multitude of bugs this program features there's a bad game hidden beneath with enemies spawning on top of you in an uninspired cityscape Far Cry wannabe.
2371	1	a	I heard a lot of people ♥♥♥♥♥ing up a storm about this game and I figured I'd give it a try for myself. Despite a rough start and some jank here and there in the form of hitched objective progression that required a couple of restart checkpoints to remedy, the game has overall been pretty crash / glitch free. The game is graphically impressive cranked all the way up, but it should be noted that on my i7 4790k / 980ti / ssd system I had to drop a few things down from very high to high, namely particle density and object detail, but all the other options were maxed at 1080 and I got a solid 60fps with vsync. Some strange hitching whenever autosaves are happening, but not too bad beyond that. The lighting at night in the rain is really quite pretty, and there are really impressive dust storms and fog effects on top of some ridiculously high res textures and water effects make for a better looking game than anything on offer in Fallout 4 and I'd even say there are aspects of the engine that look better than GTA V in an open world setting. I hope they finish optimizing the game for ultra settings.   The gameplay is a mix of Far Cry and Metal Gear in some weird ways, and there are even times when I found myself feeling like I was in a Fallout game. Stealth play is viable in most scenarios and the tools given to you come together later in the game to make for some interesting sabotage / raid situations. A good mix of mission objectives and open world enemy population / mission spawning ensures that you're always doing something different for what feels like the first 15 hours, after which the game settles in to a routine that I've little hope will change much through to the end, but that is OK because the gameplay loop is rather fun.   It should also be noted that the shooting is rather unforgiving and there are some guided mission objectives that are brutal and demanding. I almost gave up once or twice, but if you power on and have Dark Souls patience in you then eventually you'll get the hang of it. I'm playing on the medium difficulty and finding it just right. AI in general is a bit wonky but enemy engagements are good enough. Your friendly AI is indeed a bit dumb, but they serve as fodder long enough to give you the upper hand. This seems to be their job and they do it well enough.   Having just played DOOM and Uncharted 4 I came into this game with low expectations, between the highs those two games gave me and the review embargo for this game coupled with all the toxic forum discussions about what a turd this game was going to be I have to say that I'm glad I ignored all the naysayers. I'm looking forward to taking my time with the rest of the game. From what I've been reading about where I'm at in the campaign, I have another 10-15 hours to go on top of the 20 I already sunk in, and for my money that is a pretty good deal. I'd give this one a try.  
2373	1	a	  I would give this a 7.5/10, the game has some glitches/bugs and you will notice some if you play the story for a decent amount of time, it has poor multiplayer but what it lacks in multiplayer it compensates in the singleplayer story. What i noticed was the lack of options for the graphics and mouse sensivity but you can adjust it at a mediocre level.  The gameplay is very imersive has lots of customization options i specially loved the stealth but everyone has it playstyle and i bet that all of them work, the only downside i noticed was the AI being a bit weird sometimes where the bots would stay still while getting shot. Graphics wise they are pretty good and they look even better with the day/night cicle where you can see beautiful sunsets and can also experience some night combat.  Let's go kill some KPA!   http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=761389416 
2375	1	a	This is a good solid game. I have played it a lot of hours during the free trial weekend. I don't know how it was at launch, but I think it's pretty good now. I plan on buying it when all the DLC is out.
2377	1	a	It's a lot better than what people say, I can only imagine what the bugs must have been like because it's genuinely a fun game. Is it the best thing ever? No, but from the bit I played of it you could do way worse.
2379	1	a	I ran like miles from a kpa officer but he still found me....then I ran like three feet from him and hid in the dumpster. He and three other officers proceeded to drain their ammo into the trash can while looking at me DEAD in the eye. But then they left...10/10
2381	1	a	Great game. I dont believe it should be getting as much hate as it is. Never once crashed for me, no bugs, runned smooth and the entire idea of the game was just really neat and interesting. I enjoy every bit of it and Had a good time blowing the ♥♥♥♥ out of the KPA and starting the crowds of people to get all wild. There is some downsides though, I never felt SUPER attached to the campaign or story for example when a big character would die Id just be like,' welp ♥♥♥♥.' It wasent like gears of war, red faction, arma 3, and bunch of more attached feeling campaignes. Other then that I enjoyed it all and if your looking for a cool story, fun gameplay to burn time, then I recommend buying this. 8/10  10/10 would whatch guys face get bashed with hammer again 10/10 would whatch that guy who bashed the other guys face in get his face bashed in 10/10 would whatch that guy who bashed the guys face in who bashed the other guys face in get shot in the knee. 
2383	1	a	I see a lot of negative reviews on performance of this game. I experienced none of these.  I Looked over the patch notes and it seems the problem was solved shortly before I purchased.    The Good   1. First off the game looks absoulutly amazing. 2. Excellent and extremly detailed area designs. 3. After liberating a stronghold or area it changes.  4. Story Is pretty decent and tons of content.  5. Character models / clothing are very detailed.  6. Able to customize guns on the fly. 7. Can recruit people to help you fight and they are viable.  8. Concept and atmosphere.   The Bad  1. Not enough equipment. 2. Not enough guns. 3. Not enough unique upgrades. 4. There needs to be more npc character models for civilians.  5. I would have liked to see more types of vehicles. 6. No skill tree in single player. 7. Stealth is lacking.  8. Game still has Bugs and ai issues. Though, none stopped my progression.  Overall i'd still recommend. I got it on sale and don't regret it at all. Having a blast so far, and you can really see that the hard work and effort put into this. 7.5 / 10. Wish they would have skipped the co-op and focused on development and progression of single player.  On a side note. Session pass does not give all content. Didin't like that one bit.
2385	1	a	  They fixed most of the problems.
2387	1	a	  I played this game during the free weekend, the story is average, and the game activites are just like Far Cry, but i like it, buy this game on steam sale, the game has amazing graphics and face capturing animiations. i would give this a 7/11, the devs improved preformance, it runs really smooth on my old GTX670 !
2389	1	a	Like Red Faction, without destruction of buildings, but with MUCH better feeling of guerilla warfare. Noticed a few minor bugs, but luckily nothing game-breaking.
2391	1	a	  Played this on a free weekend.  I enjoyed the game and will continue to play it when I have time. It has a great open world full of a dark atmosphere, Its mechanics are very like Far cry 3.  The game still suffers with hanging and a few glitches like textures not loading on surfaces and NPC ect.  The frame rate was always above 60fps with everything on very high(2xsmaa + txaa 60%) except shadows, shading and shadows res.  Fx 8350 4.0ghz GTx 970 (OC to 370mhz more) 16Gb 1886
2393	1	a	  Its like Farcry and Division had a baby with a slight birth defect.  Its actually not that bad of a game, I managed to power through the entire single player campaign during the free weekend. The biggest complaint I have about it is the weapons...the ONLY silent weapon you get other than your knife is the pistol / SMG / air pistol which REALLY sucked especially since towards the end one of the guys is toting the AR with a suppressor.  You really end up only needing 2-3 weapons out of all of them and by the end of it if you liberate everything you end up owning every piece of gear, attachment, and all skills leveled up. Some of the weapons just seemed pointless. I didnt even use the cross bow with its 3 variations. Bravo by the way with the weapon variations.  You pick one weapon like the AR and you get 2 additional with a slight purchase. It was certainly different but also kind of annoying as not all weapons could use the same attachements. Literally the only weapon that the suppressor went on is the pistol... Sorry to keep bringing that part up, it really annoyed me.  All in all though the game was pretty good, graphics were beautiful. AI was a little lacking, but it was not too bad.
2395	1	a	Wish I had realized that the Steam Free Weekend was happening sooner because I really liked the story and the missions of this game. Although the game play was a bit laggy at times - even when I lowered the settings from what had automatically been selected, it had overall good mechanics and great graphics and decently smart AI. There were a few glitches that threw me outside the map when jumping a fence, but other than that, a very good experience.
2397	1	a	  I enjoyed this game. Even though that's apparently a carnal sin to some people on the forums of this game. Got it for the free weekend and honestly, if I'd have had the money I would have bought it in the sale to replay it at some point. The game's actually solid, even if the weapon system is restricting (Not a fan of the games that give you one type of assault rifle and have that whole kit swapping thing). The biggest draw for me was that you felt like an actual revolutionary, using hit and run attacks on KPA officials in their convoys, subtly killing lone soldiers dumb enough to walk on the back streets with no backup, and dismantling the propaganda machines. I loved using the molotovs in the game, observing KPA patrols and then tossing a molotov into the middle of them and bolting before they figured out what'd happened.  I enjoyed it, I'd recommend it while it was on sale.
2399	1	a	*Playing on the FREE weekend* Not played too much but i'm glad I waited. Runs really nice and seems to be a lot of fun. The intro went on a bit longer than i'd have liked but I guess its setting the scene.  Overall i'm tempted to purchase the game now, after the free weekend obviously.
2401	1	a	I really enjoyed playing this game. Cudos to developers for putting together a great single player campaign. I will say I purchased this game after most of the reported bugs had been patched and had no problems running the game on medium settings with my gtx 760 2 gb card. This game is running on the crysis engine, which is a lot more demanding than other graphic engines I know of. This game is worlds better than the first game. If you are trying to decide if you should buy this game, ignore the overwhelming negative reviews....they are mostly pre-patch reviews where people were having performance issues.   Pro's  + Great environment and sense of detail + Weapon changing system very creative and fun to interact with +Story kept me engaged for a respectable 18 plus hours...Yes it is hard to beleive North Korea took over US but the devs had to stay in keeping with the first game. +Great graphics and sound effects....will definitely replay once I upgrade my graphics card  Con's  -While the zones were decent in size, I wish the zones would have been linked into one zone...more open world  Overall, if you enjoy first person, open world games, you should pick up Homefront. Support the people who went through so much and so many years to bring us this great titile. I hope to see a sequel to this game in the future.
2403	1	a	Great game. I dont believe it should be getting as much hate as it is. Never once crashed for me, no bugs, runned smooth and the entire idea of the game was just really neat and interesting. I enjoy every bit of it and Had a good time blowing the ♥♥♥♥ out of the KPA and starting the crowds of people to get all wild.

787	0	a	  I recommend it if it is on special.
2405	1	a	If you like Far Cry style games, where you are in an open area and have to take over outposts, you will probably like this game. With the gun play and gadgets in the game, this was where the main fun was for me in this game. However, I found the set plays in this game annoying due to bad AI and glitches. I have seen people sitting in cars that don't exist, for example. I have had missions that dont go correctly because the trigger for the next part of the mission doesn't work. Due to these glitches, I would only recommend to buy this game on sale.
2407	1	a	I enjoyed this game. At first I had problems with performance but after tweaking and lowering graphic settings I got it to run about 40-60 fps when outside with minimum 30. Should also mention that my computer is below minimum requirements with GPU.   Gameplay is like all the open world games(Far Cry 3/AssAssIn Creed) - You have a map where you can run around and you must retake outposts. You can upgrade your weapons and each weapon has three configurations for example your assault rifle can be also machine gun or 20 mm rocket launcher.  Single player campaign for me was 20-21 hours with every outpost taken. Story was OK, there were some things that were interesting but most of it was expected.  I tried multiplayer and it the first impression was good, but I am not interested in multiplayer. It's coop only multiplayer.  Music was okay and I think there were 2 songs that IMO were quite good.  Flaws? Performance could have been better. More gun upgrades. There were some bugs, nothing game breaking, just visual bugs.  Conclusion: If you enjoyed Far Cry 3 and other open world games then you'll like this too.
2409	1	a	Homefront The Revolution is not as bad of a game as the reviews seem to suggest. It has some good stuff such as the weapon progression, customisation, decent combat and beautiful graphics. Its essentially a FarCry 3/4 rip but has its own unique features. The problem with it is all the good only lasts 2 hours, after that it is just a reprtitive game with no incentive to finish. Games like this need a strong narrative to incentivise players to finish it. I doubt I will continue with it but for the price I got it for ($17AUD) it was definately worth it.
2411	1	a	The game was recently up for a free weekend, and despite the mixed reviews, I enjoyed the game enough to purchase it on sale. All in all I think there's a lot to enjoy here. First the bad - the noted frame rate drops, and the occasional minor bug typical of open world games - NPCs mispathing, or blocking doors or staircases; a few minor missteps when jumping or looting, etc., and some audio bugs with speeches playing over each other, but over all there were no game breaking bugs and no crashes or freezes at all.  The good - in terms of gameplay, the story and world gameplay both unfold nicely. The open world setting works very well for the style of game - some areas start out clean and pristine, and there's a good mix of stealth gameplay and action as you move throughout the zones, sabatoging and taking on random events and exploration. As you progress the citizens around you start to rise up, attacking guards, spraypainting walls, etc. You see the effects of your progress on the world and it helps create a lot of immersion.  In terms of mechanics, the gunplay is average - there are some fairly bullet spongey enemies, but you're able to upgrade your weapons in order to reduce that. AI is decent - enemies will take cover and throw grenades, but they're fairly same-ish for the most part. There's not a massive variety of weapons, but it makes sense in the context of the game world. Ambushing patrols with remote explosives is a lot of fun and definitely makes you feel like you're playing the part of a revolutionary.  The story and voice acting are acceptable and move the action forward but they're not winning any awards. Graphics are good and it runs well on older hardware, aside from the aformentioned frame rate drops, which seem to occur regardless of your specs.   Overall if you get this game on sale, it's a good time and I found myself wanting to play more. Unfortunatly any online play seems to be dead, but I bought this mainly for single player and it lived up to my expectations.
2413	1	a	This is my 1st review ever basicaly because these poor game has been beaten around the town badly... maybe whrn it launched it was bad had glitches but right now its simply smooth and flawless i played 20 hours without a single crash. Its from same studios that made dead island so story is intense n decent. This game has the best NPC i have ever seen they perform there roles perfectly. Plz play n judge urself dont go for old reviews. Graphics are devent no fall in frame rate
2415	1	a	I had some pretty low expectations for this game. Virtually every critic seemed to hate it. And I get it, it's a pretty generic shooter with a lot of half-executed ideas. But what's there is fun. A ridiculous plot sets up some big set pieces, but for the most part you're free to roam around a section of the city and slowly liberate areas - which makes traversing around as a trespasser much easier. Stealth is handled competently and the gun play is fun, albeit shallow. The best parts are definitely scouting out locations and climbing rooftops to figure out how to recapture occupied areas.  For around $10 on sale, this game is a neat shooter with some memorable moments.
2417	1	a	I have to recommend this game, I have been a fan of games with this stye and have played the original Homefront. Since the 2.0 patch dropped I can definitley see a huge increase in performance. I recommend getting the game while it is on sale as I feel it will definitley be worth it.  Edit: I forgot to mention this, the animations do seem a little robotic but I'm not too big on that being a problem personally.
2419	1	a	The game divides itself between these open Red Zone battlefields and the (slightly) more civilised Yellow Zones. These are run down urban areas where the oppressed American population live under the angry, stompy boot of the Korean Army. They play out much like the Red Zones - open areas with multiple objectives leading up to a final goal - but add in a barely formed stealth mechanic and a far more stern response if you’re seen. Get spotted and it’s a case of running away, breaking line of sight and waiting out the alarm. It’s likely something you’ll be doing a lot. Because these areas are more built up it’s easier to get caught or cornered when things do go south.     Homefront: The Revolution manages to be entertaining without ever completely delivering on its open world warfare potential. There’s definitely an interesting game here if you fancy a different paced shooter. There’s just a few bits that don't quite click. The pace between the Red and Yellow Zones doesn’t flow as smoothly as it could, for example. The scrappy free roam fighting can deliver some great moments, but just as equally frustrate with loops of dying and respawning (the more restrictive set pieces fights can be especially guilty of this) and guns just don't feel... 'right'. Combined it all keeps Homefront at the level of ‘basically okay’.   7/10
2421	1	a	if u wanna do some exploring and doing some rebelion stuff this game is pretty good ,
2423	1	a	i have played the original and this one was far better. honestly i love playing FPS games that have great storylines. this game is gritty, pretty brutal and all around fun to play. with how player driven the storyline gets, it has some replay ability value in it for future playthroughs.
2425	1	a	Game is much better than I expected after reading reviews. Setting is awesome (non-combatants NPC behavior looks very natural, every house/ruin looks different and natural). Checkpoints don’t similar to each other thus not became boring. Graphics is on very good level. Music is also nice. On-fly weapon mods attachment is just awesome. Scenario is quite nice (at least much better that in several recent CoD)
2427	1	a	  This is definately a step up from the first Homefront game. It reminds me of Red Faction: Guerilla, the Saboteur, and maybe a little GTA.   The world is open but manageable. The look and feel are spot on and the gun play is as good as any other current shooter. It came across as a little to predictable for me so don't expect much from the story. I was plesantly amused by the upgrades to the guns. Maybe all weapons should be so easily swapped out with parts to make other bigger weapons.   I initially loved the idea of hoping on a motorcycle until I tried it. Too much debri on the streets and using the keyboard to drive made the experience a hectic motorcross nightmare.   Claiming locations to free up the map was a bit too easy also. Simply activate the console, laptop, pressure valve and the area is yours. All the enemies vanish and your own troops take up residence.  It's a good run around game where you get to shoot at guys or drones for a bit. Not the best game ever and certainly stuff we have seen a time or two before, but much better than the original.
2429	1	a	  Free Weekend Player  I enjoyed this. It has a lot of problems with bugs and some very janky animations, but when it does get things right, the movement is very fluid. Animations are horrendous, characters look like broken marionettes and facial expressions are next to none.  It's basically Far Cry 3 but without the charm. I did enjoy the concept of fitting in with crowds in certain areas, but it fell down a lot in terms of execution. Repetitive activities peppered with flashpoint activities a la Far Cry 4's outpost defence missions, don't hinder the game too much but also don't challenge you much.  Characters are one dimensional and bland. Ethan Brady is like a less charming Gordon Freeman, which is difficult to achieve.  The weapon conversion system is a nifty idea, but you'll end up relying on one or two weapons for the majority of the game (for me, it was the SMG pistol conversion, and the Marksman Rifle Battle rifle conversion, with the Rocket Launcher for the last third of the game) simply because they are more effective.   Overall, it's not an amazing game. It's pretty mediocre really. But I enjoyed it, and honestly I'll probably buy it in the future. It's definitely not a full price purchase though. It's too bland.  5/10
2431	1	a	Long to start,no problem running, great graphics. Love the need to stealth with action.
2433	1	a	The game is great..though not the best. Just beat the game last night b/c I decided to take off work to play Homefront. Overall a lengthful game, but quite repetative. It's fun raiding areas and doing strikes...for the first few times, but that gets really old and annoying. Good things about the game are the upgradable guns. They have gears that allow to enhance your character(Brady) to take more damage or reload faster. A note though. This is not an rpg shooter, but I maybe or interested in these takes for fps games. Having a standard shooter story is very boring and does not have quite the like for me. Though this game is story focus and this game does not have PVP fights like battlefield or raindbow six. This game is somewhat comparable to the metro games series. The story is understandable. U.S falling into debt to North Korea. Now they are under their rules until the debt is payed off(surprised China didn't do that in reality). I did run into some bugs like flickering walls or buildings. Had some dumb AI's walking towards walls and sudden framedrops. This only happended early and part of the way to the end. Great game for one go, but there is no newgame+. So no second journeys for me. I'd recommend if you're willing to look past the bad comments and possibly wait for another sale. Got it during the 23.99 sale.
2435	1	a	So I played this game for a few hours on and off for a few weeks. I was not really a fan of the first one but I really like the concept that the homefront story line has to offer. When I first started playing the bugs and the system slowdowns really, really, really killed the game for me and stopped playing it (got to the game breaking bug were I met some random dude before the armory got raided). On a whim I decided to pick it up again after fallout 4 and because of the patching the game is FAR BETTER and actually worth playing.  The game is not the game I wanted Homefront TR to be but it is ok and a good way to kill a few hours. By far my biggest issues with this game is two fold...  1. The lack of weapons, in the first Homefront there were tons of different weapons from several types of HMG, MMG, SMGs, pistols, AR/AK variants, ect. In this game there are maybe about 12'ish weapons that are diverse but you get the one or two that work with your play style and generally keep them. With the last homefront you felt that need to pick up a new weapon every few mins because you felt the need to try this M4 with the EO Tech, oh look a AK with a CCO, OMG a Shotgun with a ACOG!!!!!!  2. This game suffers from the Farcry outpost capturing bug. Once you clear a sector it is sort of rinse and repeat, there are sectors that are more fun to libreate such as the one where the KNA supporters live but once again there is little variety.   TLDR: Good game (NOW), pick it up on sale, waste a few hours that god has given us and move on with your life. Wish they used the weapon variety that the old homefront had.  
789	0	a	Okay to start with but then gets worse and worse and you have to do the same things over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over. You get meh?
2437	1	a	This game parallels Half-Life in how amazing it is, it truly is a revolution.
2439	1	a	User dood1234 couldnt have said it any better. I just finished the game and I feel the same now about it as I did when I first started playing. Here is his review and its spot on.  'I have never written a reivew before because I generally feel like the community or the critics get it right. This game is a different case. This game is so underrated it hurts. I cannot speak for how it played at launch but I can speak to how it plays now. It honestly does something other games dont't, and thats give me a ton of tools but at the same time make me feel like an underdog. In my opinion the shooting is very crisp and strategic. Also the weapon modding is awesome making one gun so much more versitile. Also the story seems decent with a very good setting to boot. The graphics are good but demanding. Because of this if you don't have current hardware you should wait to buy this. so far I am only a few hours in but this feels like a more focused and difficult far cry game. Because of the launch issues this game experienced I think it's reputation got ruined. This is definetly one of those games that needs to be given a second chance because it's to much dang fun not to.' -dood1234

2443	1	a	I heard Homefront: The Revolution was buggy before, but today its not buggy anymore. Thanks for the patch! I would rate this game 8.5/10. I finished Homefront The Revolution.  Pros: +Custom your weapons +Open World +Good Graphics  Cons  -Repititive Objective
790	0	a	Okay to start with but then gets worse and worse and you have to do the same things over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over. You get meh?
791	0	a	Played free weekend. Not the best animation texture and lighting looks ok though. Was on a mission to excuvate some trucks . Trucks NPC driver got stuck and couldn't continue the mission 5/10
2445	1	a	  A solid 6/10 game that's essentially a far cry clone but set in an urban environment. Recommended if you can find it on sale.
2447	1	a	I bought Homefront: The Revolution when it launched, so I did see the glitches and bugs that people were complaining about. But now the game runs silky smooth!  Content wise there's plenty to do - Capture KPA Strongholds, rescue resistance fighters, highjack armoured convoys - there's always something cool to do!  It's actually really fun to get all the radios, bike stashes, capture all Strikepoints etc.  The multiplayer is really good aswell, but the singleplayer is where it shines. It's nice to play with a beer after a hard day at work.  
793	0	a	Honestly, quite boring with all the unskippable in-game cutscenes. Mediocre at best. Enjoying the arcade machine the most. Too many hours spent without it.
794	0	a	Surprise, Homefront sequel is as good as the first. Which with how buggy, poorly written, horribly designed, and cheaply advertised as it was, meant that the bar to do better was set lower than qualifications needed to enroll into ITT Tech. Yet the developers did it, they managed to slide over that bar by making the game visually appealing, and that's about it. Sound design is out of sync, the voice actors seem uninterested, if you listen close enough you can hear their agents writing out their checks over the sound of monotone gunfire. The story is weaker than a polio stricken childs legs, with the US having given the keys to their military to North  Korea...why?  Because they made cool phones and apps. Your character doesn't talk as well, so you're basically Yes man Mario, with strong political views. Which with how the story plays out is really out of place. Questioned if you're a spy for the North Koreans, your lack of response clearly means you're not, and so you're trusted with every detail of the underground rebel fighters hide outs, weaknesses, locations, etc.  Outside of the story and sound, the Ai is terrible as well. You can be in the middle of a warzone running around with your gun out, but a few feet away a military patrol can be standing idly swapping kimchi recipes completely ignoring you. Taking out enemy stronghold points for your 'resistance' to take over is pretty simple as well. Walk into an area and shotgun enemies in the face as they frantically run around suffering Stormtrooper syndrome by missing most of their shots. Probably would have had more trouble firing a shotgun into a barrel of gerbils than I did taking on any of the threats in this game.  If the first game was supposed to be inspired by the movie Red Dawn, Homefront: The Revolution is more like watching Patrick Swayze die of pancreatic cancer.
795	0	a	  thank god i didnt buy that game though it looks fine, for me the game freezes after first tutorial mission. it has perspectives, but dont buy it as it is still in beta phase...
796	0	a	Better than previous game, but still not enjoyable and monotonous. It had potential but...they ruined it.
797	0	a	Avoid at all costs (for now)  This game is so broken right now it hardly runs and when it dose it runs like a steaming pile of crap.   I reached out to the devs and the publisher and my requests have been met with silence.   This is the first game in over 20 years I have asked for my money back on.  And I have played some bad games but nothing like this.   I cannot event comment on the story because of how broken the game is. I am hopeful however that in time they will fix these issues and this will be enjoyable. So for now I would avoid this until they fix it.   I will update this if and when the fix this game.
798	0	a	Average game with 'Hooray' plot.  Pros 1. Run and Gun. You have legs and you have guns customization (but don't be so escited - only 4 types of classic guns, crossbow and rpg). 2. Not bad le finale scene  Const 1. Dumb storyline. You are surrounding by stupid mates, fighting with even more stupid enemy. Add to this fight some hooray slogans, some plot twits, that you can easy predict and you've got Homefront®: The Revolution. 2. Dumb AI. Its just you against the world, sometimes your friends from rebellion will come, sometimes shoot and die. 3. Boring gameplay likes Farcry title - capturing points, hacking devices and repeat repeat repeat. Have captured the point? Ok, enemy trops will not be in this territory, and its all.  3. Random fps lags. 4. Bugs. A lot of bugs - sound bugs, invisible items, jumping bugs from moto etc.  This game shouldn't have price of 60 $. Its cool only first 1-2 hours, after you need repeat same things again. The game is funny but it doesn't have the rebellion spirit.

2449	1	a	Decent shooter, even though mobs disappearing out of 'nothing' gets kinda ... annoying.  Lots of ubistuff to do around the map.   The game world is decently 'littered' to resemble a post-Trump US. And even though we call them Norks we all know the bad guys are really China.   The hacking minigame really require a controller.  Not really happy about having to download and fill my SSD with 8GB of spoken 'crap' for language settings I would _never_ enable. That is around 13% of the total footprint of the game, so it is quite a lot.  
2451	1	a	This game is just great!  If you like a game that puts you in charge of a Rebellion group, trying to fight thier opressors, this is just a great job of the devs!   The pro's:  - The graphics are just nice! - Lots of weaponary to put your character just in the place that you want it. - Multiplayer is a little small, this needs improvement but it's still okay if you find a match! Leveling up is exciting because the more you've got, the funnier it is, even the clothes you put on makes you stronger/weaker.  - The gameplay is great, even if there are some little bugs. - The missions are just fun, getting control upon bases of your enemy! - It isn't always that 'easy' to get everything trough. - The story it tells is great, you'll always BE a hero!  - Con's  - Small multiplayer community, not a big deal, but it is affecting it... - Sometimes buggy and laggy, I don't know why it is, but if you'll be okay with it, it'll be still fun to play! (Like I did!) - the way you can transport isn't always great, this made me think a lot to get from A to B, here they've could done something.
834	0	a	Now with extra bugs... a short one-hour DLC broke the multiplayer, hope it will be patched soon...  Only recommended for fans of open world shooters if on sale at &gt;50% off.   The bad: - Rushed release with all the bugs you'd expect: Poor detection, crashes, getting stuck in the interface in-game, regularly falling through the floor, failing to trigger melee takedowns and being gunned down as a result... I could go on and on and on. - Campaign with a generic story that packs very few emotional punches. - Rushed multiplayer and really lackluster matchmacking... probably the reason why so few people are available for matches.   The good: - Brutal start to the campaign, very atmospheric and dark, has that oppressed vibe like City 17. - The apocalyptic warzones / red zones are the highlight of the game and feature some fantastic level design (especially for the multiplayer missions). - Decent shooting mechanics and creative weapon animations.

2453	1	a	I was hesitant to buy this game because of all the bad reviews. I will say it is playable and cryengine looks good although I am disappointed that it doesn't have dual GPU support. Still my fury x coupled with a 5820k @ 4Ghz runs it on very high/ultra at 3440x1440. I don't get any stuttering except when the game saves.  It would be better if I could run both my fury x's :) like I can on crysis 3.  Yeah it's glitchy. Whenever it rains in game there is a strobe effect on the ground which is really irritating. The NPC AI is incredibly poor. Be prepared for some dumb enemies and allied NPCs doing things like blocking the player into corners of the room. Incredibly annoying programming basically.    I had read in reviews that enemies keep spawning until the player hides and/or runs away. I wasn't sure whta that meant but I am now.  To me though it's obviously a gameplay design choice the developers made and is part of building the atmosphere.  It's playable and I am going to play it through. Not worth the money though. Wait for it to go on sale. It is clearly a game that was released before it had been completed. If the deveoplers had the time and money then I am sure it would have been a far more polished product.  If I was feeling cynical I would say it has the feel of whoever provided the budget just wanting to break even. If it had been finished before it was released it would have been a great game. Still good enough to play though.  The following are just some additional musings......  I don't know if cryengine is optimised for amd. I would doubt it's optimised for either amd or nvidia and is a generic game engine for licensing to third parties. I am not talking about cry engine 3 which was optimised for amd in crysis 3 and is still one of the most hardware punishing game engines out there along with the 4A engine used in the metro games which is optimised for nvidia of course :)   Anyway recently I fired up far cry 3 again. It's unplayable using CF and if I use one card it's glitchy and I get ridiculous framedrops, stuttering and freezes. This is on an i7 5820k @ 4Ghz, 16GB of DDR4 Ram, Radeon R9 Fury X in 2 way crossfire, 3440x1440 acer @ 75hz. The OS is windows 10 pro.  While it is not an insanely over the top set up. It's still a fairly decent gaming machine. Which you would expect to handle Far Cry 3.  I know it's optimised for nvidia and when it dropped originally it was unplayable on amd hardware on higher settings I was using a 7970ghz CF setup. I had to drop the settngs to play it and that still had all sorts of graphics glitches as well.  I am waiting to see what amd has to offer with vega but I could be switching to nvidia. Personally I think it is bad for gaming having these hardware vendor tie ins. A decent set of graphics cards is not cheap. I would probably be better off getting a console.......nah.
2455	1	a	I loved this game. It took me 45 hours to finish, so I feel like I got my money's worth. Those people who complained that they finished it in six hours just cheated themselves. Played properly, it's quite enjoyable. There were some minor bugs, but I had only one that was substantial and prevented me from completing a zone, but it didn't impact the storyline. The game did have some stuttering issues, but they were fixed the first day.  A lot of people are complaining that it's not Doom, but I don't think it was intended to be. You can't just run in guns blazing and expect to survive. I played it as a stealth game and had a blast. It requires you to use your NPC comrades to create a squad. They would pin down the enemies and I would run around behind and pick them off one at a time.  Played the way it was intended, this game is a lot of fun.
2457	1	a	This game had a messy launch but thankfully that's not the case now. I purchased the game + expansion pass at 50% discount and I am not disappointed. The story is so so... but the gameplay hooks you in. This game plays like it is part Dying Light (Climbing, Jumping, Activating towers etc) and part Battlefield (Gunplay) along with Crysis like weapon modification on the fly. The open world divided into several sections look really detailed and give the impression of a city in revolution. The animation look good but there are some minor glitches here and there. I will now try out the DLC's and the Co Op mode. Overall a good game. Purchase when its on discount.
2459	1	a	  this game is a game 9/11
2461	1	a	NOTE: I am a singleplayer gamer, so I'll only be reviewing the singleplayer portion(s) of this game.  TL;DR - Great game, and I do recommend it for others. But since you can't play past the ending, it's not a game I'm going to play more than once. Thanks for the free weekend so that I didn't end up regretting a purchase.  Now that that's out of the way...  Played through story mode from beginning to end. Story itself had potential to be really great through-and-through, but certain climactic moments were full of cliche and uniformity (especially the end bit). While I was quite disappointed that it didn't follow the original concepts of the original Homefront (esp. because John Milius was a consultant for the original Homefront story) it ended up being capable of standing on its own feet, as it were. I did rather appreciate the constant fear of betrayal, and even being on the receiving end of suspected betrayal, but I didn't like how the KPA took over the US via waging economic war. I much preferred the original story, and this one would have been great as a game of its own, without sharing the spirit of another.  With all that said however, it broke my biggest rule in 'open world' gaming; in Homefront: The Revolution, you can't play past the ending. That, in itself, is normally a dealbreaker for me. There have been a few exceptions to this (especially Fallout: New Vegas since you can just 'fix' that with a mod). But unfortunately, this game is not the exception, but the rule. Sure, it has other 'modes' you can play in singleplayer, but if I can't get the story out of the way so that I can freely muck about in the worldspace(s) without that main mission marker making me avoid certain areas and/or safehouses, then I simply won't play it again. This is functionally a quasi-clone of the latest Far Cry games, and both FC3 and FC4 let you play past the story. And before anyone suggests it; NO, reloading the checkpoint from before accepting the 'Point of No Return' mission is NOT acceptable.  Now, if they ever release a 'free roam' DLC where the story bit is removed from the entire worldspace whereby all the yellow and red zones are unlocked, and you can continually do random jobs, I might consider purchasing the Freedom Fighter Bundle when it's on sale again. But until that happens, no sale. By the way, yes, I am indeed suggesting I'd buy it as a DLC.  Aside from that... Even though they released the 'performance patch,' I still got quite a bit of lag playing through the story. My rig only just barely exceeds the recommended requirements, but even still, I don't think they're quite done with their optimisations. Either that, or they may want to up their recommended requirements to match what is actually required to not have the game completely freeze for a few seconds upon entering a new zone.  At the end of the day, I do like the game. I just don't like it enough to support devs who make open-world games yet keep the ending closed. So while I greatly appreciate the free weekend that allowed me to make a well-informed purchase decision, I won't be buying it until that huge mistake is corrected.  I already know a lot of people don't care about the whole 'open world; closed ending' thing, and [sarcasm]good for you[/sarcasm] if that's the case. But shut up, this ain't your review, nor your wallet.
2463	1	a	  Ok I beat the game as far as after meeting the mayor face to face. After that the game ♥♥♥♥ed all kinds of up. I was stuck with the cam feed as my hud so then I reloaded last save then I got stuck in a safe house and could not jump to get out of the window. This is by far one of the worst game ever. FPS was so ♥♥♥♥ed I never got over 17 FPS and my PC is over the min requirements. Really WTF! You I only played it for free this weekend but you guys should give me $60 for this ♥♥♥♥.
2465	1	a	Bought this game for around $23 when it was on sale. That's a fair price. I had fun playing this game, but I doubt I would play it again. The atmosphere and graphics were on point. As the game is now, my GTX 770/i5/16gb rig ran it maxed out at ~45-60fps with no noticable performance issues. There were some bugs and glitches in regards to gunplay, and some NPCs would magically disappear, but it was hardly game-breaking, just made me question the normal $40 price point. The voice acting and writing were a bit off, but the storyline was interesting enough for an FPS.  This game is a bit repetitive, but the different control point objectives are different and varied enough that at least I felt engaged for every little battle. I tell my friends this is a mashup of Assassin's Creed and Far Cry, with some Fallout-level destruction thrown in there. Running around the 'Red Zone', shooting snipers, then running to a different position while avoiding air ships was fun. And seeing a guard abusing a civilian and slitting that guard's throat was satisfying.   All in all, I'd give this game a 7/10 for the $20 sale price. It'd be 6/10 if I paid full price.  Tl;dr: Wait for the game to go on sale.
2467	1	a	Alot like far cry if you do enjoy the Far cry series Give this a try.
2469	1	a	It is a good game for the first 4 hours but after that it gets repetitive.There is a lot of variety in weapon customization which actually doesn't apply in combat as you almost always do the same tactics and takeouts.Other than that the graphics are quite a joy to look at but not at the levels of crysis 3 as it uses the same engine.Homefront The revolution is an open world fps at the style of far cry 3 where you go around liberating posts and doing the main mission or side quests.
849	0	a	Plain awful. No plot, no gameplay, no nothing. How could they fail original Homefront so badly?
2471	1	a	40GB download Wow....Free week was good. Doesn't seem to have a multiplayer like the last game. Instead of PVP its PVE mission for multiplayer
2473	1	a	  Was a bad game, now a quite good game, not the best, but pretty great right now. Hopefully more stability patches are released, and I think I'll purchase it now. (Played the beta before release and replayed the free Steam weekend.)
2475	1	a	Set in an alternate future, where North Korea became the technical powerhouse instead of Japan, North Korea has invaded and taken over the USA. Now many years later, North Korea enforces occupation with the KPA, who police all citizens with an iron fist. You have joined the resistance and fight to give freedom back to the USA and end North Korea's occupation.  Story line is really good, with great graphics, but fights are a little repetitious (i.e. hard, given the KPA's superior numbers and guns). Money can be really hard to obtain without searching through every trash pile you come across, so upgrades are far and few between. Very interesting and entertaining, but I'd be willing to wait for it to go on a big sale ('75% off, with all DLC') before paying full price.
2477	1	a	Yes I do recommend this game, however I have a more detailed review with gameplay footage on my youtube channel. (xaagaming)    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jWaFqo1N7U 
2479	1	a	It's 'ok'...  ... I guess.
2481	1	a	This is a fantastic game. Graphics are good, the gameplay is realistic, especially the vertical movement.
2483	1	a	  Homefront: the Revolution, not a perfect game by any means. Having said that, I don't understand why there is so much hate on this game. I realize it had a terrible launch, however it does seem like they've fixed most of the bugs. It only crashed on me once near the beginning which caused me to have to replay about 5 minutes. Other than that, a few graphic bugs mostly but nothing gamebreaking. My specs are   i7-6700, gtx 960, 16gb RAM   and I had about 45-60 fps on all high settings. The AI is pretty bad but not gamebreaking, at least not for me. The story was pretty basic, nothing special but it did it's job. I managed to finish the story during the free weekend so I didn't actually buy it. However on it's 40% off sale (or if you can get it even cheaper) I would say it's worth it, not at full price though.     Overall Rating
2485	1	a	It's 'ok'...  ... I guess.
2487	1	a	It's fun. I played it for about 8 hours so far and never before patch 2.0 A few bugs here and there but nothing really out of the line. I don't get the negative reviews so far. I've played some AAA titles (like A.Creed) which were hell more predictable and not as good as this. It's not a game changer but nobody ever said so. Give it a try.
2489	1	a	Just a quick comment regarding the co op mode - there are not many players around playing public mode much. Only a certain times a day, few familiar names pop up to play, but the rest of the times it is not possible to level up the character as there are no players playing the mode at all. Either most play the private co op mode, or there is no multiplayer community worth mentioning as such... just a few stragglers like me trying to play the game.  Personally I think that the game doesn't have enough co op missions to go through, gets very repeatitive after two hours when all has been seen and done. Difficulty levels add some different spawns and many mission waypoint locations, but many times the players will learn it all and no single spawning of an enemy comes as a surprise. So we would like to have more missions in the already large maps the game has, and some randomization in the mission waypoints where a base or listening post can be found.  I was also wondering if there is a possiblity to have more character slots? Since there is no respec option, those four slots will be used up in a ½ - 1 week. Come to think of it, the char slots would be used up in a 2-3 days if the multiplayer community would be available most of the time, since co op missions require other players. For truly active players who have the time in their hands, those four slots might be filled in a day with max xp characters. So give us more char slots, please.
852	0	a	  I played this on one of the recent free weekends.   TL;DR version; It's a decent game, but the areas feel repetitive and it lacks story depth. The price is not justified. $10 USD max IMHO.   As someone who played the first Homefront game, this is heading in a better direction but it's not quite there yet and generally feels like a console port. Love was not really put into the PC version IMHO. case and point in literally the first scene of the game you are on the floor and you can see how bad the floor textures are. They are more than do able but not for the current price tag of $40 USD and or the current sale price of $23.99 USD. If this game was under $10 USD then I would be way more willing to suggest it as it feels like it's worth that much on PC.   The different districts don't feel that different at all. It feels like more of the same. Yes they may look slightly less warzoney but it still feels like a warzone and they pretty much function the same way when you are taking over areas.  The AI has some issues as well. If you recruit some of the AI to help you then tend to get stuck in stairways and various other random places. And I will say that I do think it's kinda immersion breaking when early on in the game if one of the airship spots you they will send out guys and go into an alert phase while if they spot any of the AI nothing happens. I understand this was most likely done for gameplay reasons but it is kinda pretty immersion breaking to me.  The game is a bit broken it terms of it's own rules as it's stated in one of the tutorial videos that if you are currently in an alert phase that the safe houses will not take you in. When I was in the 2nd zone of the game (where the video is played the first time you go there) I would repeatedly just head to one of the safe houses if I was close and under an alert and they still let me in. It would end and I would walk out like nothing happened.  The story does not feel very deep. And really not much changes when you go from area to area from what I've played. I will also say that a lot of the gear upgrades feel spaced out to make you grind for them.
2491	1	a	Forget what people say this is a great game great game! Dambusters kkep up the hard work and keep making the gen move. The game has so much going on that its a shame no one gave this game a chance. If you love or like half Life one or Two get this game it's the modern day Half Life.9 out of 10. but i also hate number ratings if you like games then just play this game!
2493	1	a	  I like this game its smth like dying light wich is my favorite game so i think that why i enjoyed this game so much, at all a nice game but not worth the 40 bucks
854	0	a	Better than The Division and worth the price over it as more optimized and more smooth gunplay. But not a game worht running out to get
2495	1	a	  It's an okay game.   The story intrigues me at the start but after that, it gets boring real fast - Same goes with the gameplay. I do like the gun customization though.
2497	1	a	I hated the first Homefront more than any words can say. That game single handedly stopped me from ever pre-order games again and I have stuck to that rule since. It was complete garbage. I got Revolution for free from a friend who didn’t want it. I REFUSED to pay money for this after being burned from the first game but I can say that this is definitely a step in the right direction. It does have that low budget buggyness to It but the core gameplay is actually pretty fun. The level design was good (open areas now) in fact a few areas of the game are really good. Gunplay/sound was all good, only had one crash and the sound cut out on me once but a checkpoint reload fixed it. Input remapping was there but wonky, on screen prompts didn’t match rebinds and some actions you flat out could not change. This game did not need a silent protagonist, he really needed to be voiced over and his lack of interaction with other characters really took me out of the immersion. The free running/climbing system was a welcome feature as with all FPS now especially after the Dying Light handled it. Stealth mechanics could have used some more work. You could go stealth but it was not a fluid and fun as Deus Ex. They definitely need to expand on the rpg elements with gear/weapons upgrade. I got 16+ hours out of this game and I never thought I would say this about Homefront but give it a shot if your curious. It’s worth a play through.
2499	1	a	this game is good,,
2501	1	a	$15 for the game + dlc = worth it.
2503	1	a	If you can get past the bugs and performance issues, I picked it up for 9.99 and it was a pretty decent albeit repetitive experience.
2505	1	a	The very definition of an underrated game.  
2507	1	a	This game is a bit hard to get used to, it is a totally different FPS shooter playing style where 'hit and run' is the best tactic. Going in guns blazing will get you killed every time. I like the strategic aspect of planning the attack and figuring ou how you can approach the target the best. Awesome game, doe not get boring anytime soon!
2509	1	a	So far not a bad game at all. If you liked the first game youll like this one. BUT only thing i dont like about this game, i think personaly they used the wrong Engine for it. Ive never liked the 'feel' of the cryengine. but over all its a good game.
2511	1	a	If you can get past the bugs and performance issues, I picked it up for 9.99 and it was a pretty decent albeit repetitive experience.
2513	1	a	I did not buy this game on release, but during this last steam sale.   I'm about 90% through with the game right now. Just trying to find the motivation to finish it up.  The game is fine. Runs like a dream for me. The gun play is quite, quite good. Story is generic. The open world is pretty boring. Characters were pretty bland except for Dana who was marginally better than the rest of the cast.  I would not pay full price this. Wait for a deal if you can.  I have enjoyed myself, I was just expecting more. For a discounted price, I can recommend it.
2515	1	a	Picked it up on a steam sale with all the dlc. Not sure why this game got so much grief it's pretty fun. The graphics and great and so is the gun play. The story is the weakest part but it can easily be over looked cause the game is fun. Think a far cry set in a run down city instead of a jungle.
2517	1	a	One of the best games I've played in this genre in a long time. Love the mechanics and the gameplay! The scenery really adds to the overall feel of the game.
2519	1	a	I really don't see why this game received all the hate it did. Yes, it's not ground-breaking and was maybe a bit over-hyped before release, but overall, it's a solid, quality, polished, semi-open-world FPS, with passable story, great GFX, good sound and customisable guns.  Recommended.
2521	1	a	Only get this on sale...  - Controls are really wonky: you walk around like a drunk guy, the aiming is off and changes sometimes without you doing anything (I jumped down a building without moving twice)... You will lose most of your bullets trying to aim correctly (not aiming gives you a higher succesrate)... Trying to center something to open with E often results in taking the viewpoint away from that spot and being unable to open it...  - Like a lot of 'action'-games these days it starts off with several cinematics you can not scip followed by a 'walking' mission. The game only starts after 15 minutes.  + idea of the gameplay is ok, without the problems stated above, it would have been a great game.
2523	1	a	wanna try become rebellion?? fight for freedom 
2525	1	a	Honestly, sometimes you just need a dumb shooter that's easy to pick up and put down. The mechanics are simular to Far Cry and the city setting is kinda cool.  DON'T play this for the story. DO play this if you just want something to play that you don't need to get too invested in.  Doesn't deserve any awards, but it's fun in the blowing off steam after work/school
2527	1	a	So far not a bad game at all. If you liked the first game youll like this one. BUT only thing i dont like about this game, i think personaly they used the wrong Engine for it. Ive never liked the 'feel' of the cryengine. but over all its a good game.
2529	1	a	This game feels like what I think an open world Half-Life 2 would be like with influences from FarCry and Crysis. At $12 this game is a great deal. Only complaint so far is the lack of a clear save system.
2531	1	a	Gameplay is fun. Its an open world shot em up type of game. I feel like they could have done better with the main story though. Very repetative. Walk around, shoot KPA, blow up and sabatoge stuff. Fun and all but could have had more. Note, i have not played the addon mission which I have installed but im assuming more of the same gameplay. Overall, really different kind of first person shooter with the whole open world style map.
860	0	a	It runs like complete garbage for how it looks, and like most poorly optimized games, lowering the graphics settings doesn't do much at all. My PC exceeds the recommended specs, yet at absolute minimunm settings I can barely pull a stuttery 40fps. FoV is capped at 65 vertical for no good reason, ♥♥♥♥ filters all over the place that can't be disabled, janky controls obviously designed for a console, and mediocre gunplay set to an incredibly idiodic story make this a disappointingly bad game. It might have been worth it for five bucks on sale just to play TimeSplitters 2's campaign on PC, but unfortunately this game is crippled by a disgustingly bad business practice:  Denuvo, and all that brings. No doubt one of the bigger reasons for my ♥♥♥♥ performance, and a draconian DRM that requires constant online validation via their servers. The game cannot be played offline, and any hardware/software changes require you to revalidate as if you just bought the game. When Deep Silver stops caring about this game, it stops being playable. That is completely unacceptable. Stop treating your paying customers like thieves.
2533	1	a	At least level design is decent so you can enjoy what is it looks like when america city in ruin (?  gameplay is mediocre, it's not really interesting but not ♥♥♥♥ either  about A.I sometimes enemy working as intended, sometimes dumb as hell  maybe pick this game when it's cheap

2535	1	a	Despite this game having a terrible launch, it has turned out to be a great game. This game reminds me of far cry, and assassins creed. If you like those games, than this is for you, but if you dont, then dont bother picking it up.
2537	1	a	If you enjoy Farcry or any type of game like that then this game will be enjoyable to you.
2539	1	a	the main game is great fun to play and there is plenty of a atmosphere in the occupied city where the game takes place. Plenty of exploring to be done, constantly avoiding the searchlights of the Blimps that loom overhead.  the linear DLC's are in my opinion not worth playing if you really enjoy the open world part of this game.
2541	1	a	Looked good, had lots of fun fighting for the 'revolution'!. There were a few small bugs, but nothing that ruined the game or story, overall a lot of fun. I like how the game left a lot of it somewhat open, so you could do what you wanted, but still had a linear story line. Good fun! Thanks to the rough road the developers had to get this out, was worth it.
2543	1	a	I can honestly say that this game was actually really good. I played this game much later than most so I didn't experience any performance issues solid 60 fps on high all the way through. Now to the gameplay the guns in this felt really good and I loved the way you could customize the guns from the weapon wheel. In the beginning I would die quickly as I would just run in without a plan and I was slaughtered almost immediately, I do reconmmend to plan ahead such as marking enemys with your camera like the Far Cry games. I really got into the story it felt like you really fighting for something rather than mindlessly killing enemys. The two story add-ons are about 40 mins long but a big single player expansion is set to come out in sometimes this spring.  Great Game  Its a freaking steal at this price \0/
2545	1	a	This game might've had issues in the past, and like many i was put off by bad reviews. This was a game i wanted to play since it came out because i liked the concept and how they made their second game an open world one. I've played about six hours so far and i'm actually very satisfied. I haven't felt the 'need' to come back to a single player game since skyrim. Aside from the 'lack' of weapons you can actually buy and some questionable AI sometimes the game is solid. I guess you could compare it to far cry in some ways, since it's open and it let's you plan ahead but keep in mind that you'll mostly be fighting in urban areas. The tone and atmosphere of the game is pretty much what took me by surprise. Definitely worth it if you like the genre. Sometimes you gotta go past reviews to see the true potential of things for yourself.
862	0	a	Enemies disappear sometimes simply be spinning around. Almost always if trying to get a different vantage point APC, troops will disappear. This makes it hard to predict anything and annoying.  Kind of has a feel between Far Cry and Assasins Creed but needs work.
863	0	a	  This game is just bad as the first Homefront, poor performance on a high-end system. I got myself a GTX1070 and i don't even get 60FPS with everything on high. It feels and plays like an poorly console port.
2547	1	a	I wanted this game to be so much more than what it is. But it isn't, it's generic, it's repetative, gameplay is clunky and the menus are sloppy. BUT, it's not bad. It's not good, but it's not bad. I recommend getting it on a sale, it's got a different setting and has a few fun and interesting set pieces that make me not regret getting it at a decent sale.
2549	1	a	A fun, average shooter game. Would recommend when it dips to $30 or below
865	0	a	This game wasn't too bad. This is based on my gameplay during the free weekend.   Graphics: The graphics wasn't too bad. I didnt recieve any FPS drops like other reviewers and I have a GTX 760. The detail in facial features, wet vs. dry was pretty good.   Gameplay: The gameplay wasn't the worse but it did lack storyline other than 'fight the government'. Basically you're the resistance fighting against the government thru most of the game. Each new section or you can call them chapters in the game is pretty much the same. Capture this area for communication or destroy this area to limit government supplies, etc.   Bugs: The AI was ocassionally glitchy. I was able to hide in a dumpster while KPA agents were shooting me. The AI that follow you would also block you in a corner and wouldn't move no matter what you do.... unless you reload from last checkpoint was really annoying. Certain areas of the map you could glitch it where you can sometimes get up to the next floor without going around or basically fall thru the map. There was also many times where I get stuck and wouldn't be able to move (like getting stuck between the stairs and a wall) I personally find this as a bug but it may not be but the AI can not really detect you when you're above ground level. Such as chests or radio spots above ground level.   Multiplayer: I was only about to get into 1 game. There doesn't seem to be a matchmaking system and if there is, well then people just were joining multiplayer mode.   I would rate this game 4/10. It would have to be at least 80% discounted price for me to buy it. After playing a few hours (in which like 15 was afked) I wouldn't recommend or discourage people from buying this game.
2551	1	a	I was kinda homing they would continue with the original homefront, but this is more enough enjoyable enough in its sense, has a far cry ish feel, but its enjoyable to me.
2553	1	a	I'm really enjoying the game. Tried it at free weekend and in just a few hours I decided to buy it. Runs very well with i7 4770+16GB+770 2 GB. One great atmosphere moment was in the first night time, I found a rebel radio and listening while watching the ruined city was the moment I know I have to buy the game. ps: I hope someday see my dreamed Terminator game with this engine/gameplay options. That can be great.
2555	1	a	I honestly don't understand the ridiculous amount of hate for this game. I mean sure there are other games with better optimiztion and better this and that, but the thing is there's always going to be games that are better at a certain thing than the game you're playing. This game is fun and unlike any game I've played. They borrowed certain aspects of other games but blended them nicely with a pretty good story and overall fun gameplay. If you're into fps and like completing side missions and clearing zones, I strongly recommend this game! Performance is good for me (i7 4790k &amp; evga 1080 ftw), but maybe hardware depent?   Only complaint is lack of DSR support.

869	0	a	I used to recommend this game until about two weeks ago when they gave us a 2GB 'patch' taht ♥♥♥♥ed up the rendering of the world. That 'patch' was just sjilling out their new DLC, so i guess you can see where the devs' priorites lay. Also there should be NO graphical issues (running GTX 1070 and i5 6600k).
2561	1	a	Graphics R nice... Weapon customization like in crysis 3 + tranformable options.. City its like in the The Division but without snow... Story is boooooring done 11 missions and got bored all other watched on ign...Not worth playing to the end .. Good thing they gave us free for 2 days.....

2565	1	a	Taking advantage of the free weekend to try it out. I'm really surprised at the negative reviews. The major issue I see is that the AI is bad and the game is too easy so far on the normal setting. I am a huge fan of the Far Cry series and any game that copies that formula is a lot of fun for me. I would say that if you enjoyed Far Cry 3-4, Crysis 3, the Metro series, and Dying Light, I have trouble believing you wouldn't like this. This coming from a guy who thought that the some of the recent big hit titles were pretty dull (e.g., MGSV and Fallout 4). I have a GTX 970 with an i5, when I got out into the open world the FPS dropped down below 60. Wasn't actually clocking the FPS, but guessing it was 40-47ish, so I dropped down from the Very High preset to High, and it seems to be very stable and close to 60. I even have TAA on. Plenty of room to tweak if I had FPS issues. I haven't played much so far, but I may buy it while it is on sale. If not, I will certainly buy it when it drops down to $15.
2567	1	a	I actually like it, or at least so far.
2569	1	a	I dont know how this has a 30 hours campaign. I managed to finish the main story and do most side missions in the game in like 9 hours.  Games length asside , its actually a very good game! Tried the beta and it made me hate the game, which was unfortunate but i have to say that after launch issues and more than half a year of commitment to the game. Its worth it!  Didnt try the co op yet and the dlc campaign , but will update once i do.
2571	1	a	I played this during the free weekend and I have to say that it's impressed me enough for me to spend money on actually buying it.   Yes, it has problems, but there is a good game underneath the glitches and slightly sloppy mechanics. It feels like a weird crossbreed between Dying Light, Far Cry and Half Life 2...that's a compliment by the way. There is the open world of the first two games mentioned, with elements such as base liberation and use of improvised equipment such as RC car explosives, which can be fun. Then there is the world itself, which reminds me quite a bit of City 17 from Half Life 2, with weird futuristic combine like structures side by side with dilapidated tenements.   Despite my annoyances, there is a lot of ambition on display here and I would very much like to see Dambusters have another crack at an open world shooter with a slightly more coherent, focused vision.  All in all...well worth a play!
2573	1	a	This game is so close to being a good game. It has stellar graphics, a lengthy not too repetitive campaign, and pretty good cinematics/voice acting. Unfortunately its plagued by just not being polished enough. There's just little things throughout the game like a really inconsistent framerate on my 970, poor auto-saving, and even poor instructions in a lot of sections. There's a lot of side objetctives that really test your intelligence because a lot of times what you're supposed to accompish in order to complete the objective is not clear but I guess some people might actually prefer that style of the game not really holding your hand. Overall I'd say its a decent game that I would recommend but only if you're able to get it at a steep discount. Hopefully the series continues because I do really like the concept of the Homrfront games and I really enjoyed the original for the multiplayer and this game got passed around to a lot of different studios before it was completed so ultimately I think some of the shortcomings have to be forgiven.
2575	1	a	The Homefront series evolved from linear Call-of-Duty-like single player game to Far-Cry-like game.The first Homefront was an average title with a story,which potential's been wasted.There was nothing innovative about that title and the same happened to its sequel.The game has a repetitive gameplay,is poorly optimised and has dull characters(especially the crazy girl...totally horrible).I have never cared less when the main characters died, in their last act of heroism, than in this game. Additionally the activation method of the box version is needlessly complicated. Stirring up the revolution may be enjoyable,but only for a few hours - the rest becomes a struggle to survive to the end.  +Good graphics in some places +Heavy atmosphere +Weapon modifications +Character movement is slick  -Dull characters -Poor optimisation -Graphics could have been better,taking in account it's a Cry Engine -Boring storyline -Repetitive gameplay -Stupid AI -Many exploits,making the game easier  I can recommend this game,but only if you can get it on some sale.
2577	1	a	Homefront: The Revolution is an excellent game. While it brings virtually nothing new to the table, it combines various elements of game series known and loved by many, including similar social stealth elements reminiscent of Assassin's Creed, and the enjoyable gunplay and customization of Crysis. It also bears tribute to Far Cry in the capturing of various outposts and 'towers'. What really makes this game shine, however, are the stunning visuals, which really bring the battered city of Philedelphia to life. The game especially shines at nightime, and if it's raining. There are some bugs, mostly related to AI Pathfinding and some animation errors (Characters getting stuck in T-poses) but overall, it's a fairly polished game with acceptable optimization. Creds to the developers, as this game was in development hell for a long time. A solid 7/10.
2579	1	a	Based off of the free weekend I tried, The only thing wrong I see about this game is that the performance is balls.   Other than that, its got a decent story with nice cutscenes, even the voiceover is good like you can tell the devs put a lot of effort. The graphics are really good too. It even plays like your typical Far Cry game but the setting is what really does it for me.   Set in Philadellphia where North Koreans have treated Americans like dogs, you must rebel and start resistances throughout different parts of the city to ultimately overthrow the 'Norks'. That is so sick! In Far Cry, you are just getting signals and revealing parts of the map!   Trust me, if this game was the original Homefront, people would LOVE this game. I think the reason why people hate on it hard is because of two things.  1) Poor optimization = I personally get 40-60 fps on a gtx 970, amd 8320fx and 16gb ram. I get that, that sucks but it does NOT warrant a negative review UNLESS the devs are not putting out patches.  From what I understand, they have been pumping patches and actually have a pastebin where they want people to submit their dxdiag logs to see what causes the issue.   THAT IS EFFORT. THEY ARE TRYING. WHY DONT YOU BECOME A DEV AND SEE WHY YOUR GAME LAGS ON DIFFERENT BUILDS. DO YOU SEE HOW IT COULD TAKE TIME TO DIAGNOSE THAT?  2) Unoriginal 'Far Cry 3' gameply - It has that 'scavenge, resource, and take over base' gameplay thats been replicated a lot. I dont mind it. That is all I did the first 3 hours and enjoyed it. If you dont likE that gameplay, that is also fine. It just suits different people well.  Overall, I plan on buying the game since the free weekend help me form an opinion on it.
2581	1	a	Aside from random drops in framerates (mostly when there's a lot going on on screen), this is an outstanding game. Really like the 'resistance' aspects of it. Makes you feel like you're part of the Wolverines.   Of the negative reviews I've read on here it's one of a few things: 1. Bad optimization / ♥♥♥♥♥♥ computers 2. Call of Duty fanboys who use that as a benchmark for EVERYTHING. 3. Over-opinionated nerds.  
2583	1	a	In the time i played this game, i can only say its amazing, and i know, i dont have a lot of hours in this game, not even 1 hour. But i can surely recommend this to you guys. 
2585	1	a	Brady? Brady. Good. Brady, come here. Brady I got some Freedom here. Brady, take the Freedom. Deliver it to the Norks. Brady? Are you there Brady? Good. Now take that area, Brady! It's important. For Amerika. Brady. Are you following this, Brady? Good. We're glad to have you with us, Brady. Did you deliver that Freedom? Brady? Brady?  7/10 would Brady again.
873	0	a	This game is awesome i can see it just from the start. but there is only one problem: OPTIMIZATION!!  I'm on GTX 960 and its running on 30 fps for ♥♥♥♥ sake!!  Fully agree:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtfV5gHKzvo 
874	0	a	[Free weekend] Formulaic but fun.  Really hard to put money down on this when it locks up at random and has a whole mess of minor annoying bugs that don't ruin the game, but are enough to get under your skin.
875	0	a	Homefront: The Revolution. Be sure, this game is good by itself, but if you`ll compare it to other AAA-games of the same 'type', you`ll be dissapointed.  Good Things:  1. Pretty good optimised after the patch. 2. Graphics are good. 3. Customisation is awesome. 4. Overall idea is just incredible. 5. Takedown animations are great.  Bad Things:  1. The realisation of this idea is 'meh'. 2. Actors` play is awful. 3. AI is stupid AF. 4. Storyline is boring. 5. Sidequests are boring. 6. Reloading animations are bad. 7. Overall animations and cutscenes are BAD.  At this state, i don`t reccomend you to buy this game. At first? they nedd to polish EVERYTHING and enable mod-support. Then it would be awesome.  5 Walkers out of 10 Bradies.
2587	1	a	I've been enjoying Homefront: The Revolution a lot, actually picked up the season pass bundle after playing it over the free weekend. The game runs great on my i7-6700k / 970 rig, something I can not say of the new Deus Ex, and it looks pretty incredible too, good use of stylized realism. You're probably not going to see major elements here which haven't been done in other games, but the games that it's borrowing from - Far Cry, Dying Light, Assassin's Creed, and a touch of Deus Ex - are all great and those elements are still fun, while being wrapped up in a new story and new world.  As far as bugs, I've seen some z-fighting, a crash, been detected through a wall (very frustrating when it brings endless waves of soldiers on you through no fault of your own), plenty of object alignment issues (c'mon guys, fix this) and the companion AI is absolute ♥♥♥♥; but the bugginess is no worse than I'm used to seeing in AAA games. The developers deserve props for sticking out a rocky launch and actually (mostly) fixing the game.  I can't speak to what it was like at release, and I don't doubt that things were bad, but right now I definitely give Homefront: The Revolution a thumbs up. It's a good open world FPS that clicked with me very quickly and I'm looking forward to playing through the rest of the game.
2589	1	a	it a fun game - i give it 7 out 10
877	0	a	Had to buy a 700 $ gpu to play this game. 0/10 would not revolution again.
878	0	a	Stupid yellow zone   Stupid AI  Enemy never stop respawn just like F*cking cop in GTA  
2591	1	a	Underrated. Had fun playing it.
2593	1	a	Not as bad as I have heard. Gameplay felt like Dying Light but with North Koreans :D  I didn`t have any performance issues and could run the game on max settings on a 3 years old GPU.
879	0	a	Had such high expections and was let down so bad...  The frame rates suck (980 ti G1) Graphics suck Constant stuttering and freezeing  Controls suck  At one point i jumped out the window into the street and fell threw the road followed by a crash to desktop.  How they could release this game and charge the money they do for it i have no idea.   Dont buy it.  
2595	1	a	Love this game. If you like rage, you'll love this. So expansive and enjoyable to play, Its my favourite this year.
2597	1	a	Fantastic game! loving the free roaming around the place to take control. would be better if the game had multiplayer. Apart from that great game. 9/10
2599	1	a	I don't understand why this game has such a bad rap. Sure, the intro is 30 minutes long and unskippable, but the game plays like an urban Far Cry title with weapon and character / gear customization, vehicles, stealth, lock picking and 'hacking'. The gunplay is decent, nothing special but it's fun enough on it's own. The ability to drastically modify your weapon mid-firefight is pretty cool. I haven't paid any attention to the story, so I can't really rate that, but all in all, the game is at least fun. I understand it had a terrible launch, and it was a sequel no one really wanted, but if it wasn't called 'Homefront' I think this game would have done a lot better. Not worth $60, but $30? Maybe. $20, definitely.

2603	1	a	This game touched me the way my uncle use to
889	0	a	I enjoyed the first homefront game quite a bit, although linear and feeling very outdated even upon release. I really wanted to try the second one. The reviews and outrage about the bugs, and constant glitches kept me away. After seeing the game on sale twice within two months I decided to give it a go for the heck of it.  I was very...disappointed. Even on max setting the game seemed to run ok, just up until you actually got to roam around. Within the first hour I ran across the same character models over...and over. People talking in the streets sunk into the ground up to their knees and popped back up, enemies would take one shot at me, then put away their weapon and walk away letting me just walk up to them and stab them. A sniper had a light on me for 6 minutes and never took a shot, allowing me to walk up to the second floor and stabing them without them even turning around. Your own people would suddenly veer off and get stuck on something or another, and run in place forever. So....in essence the AI is completely screwed up. For being an oocupied city, it was quite void of life. Two kpa walking around, though when you took an area suddenly 10 resistance people popped up, some stood still, some ran off to get stuck on objects. I kept sighing as the hour I played was painful.   I'm told there had been patches done and the game had been more stable, and many glicthes/bugs fixed. So I can't imagine what this game was like before that. Honestly, and dlc being released? The game is still a mess of bugs. I've seen early alpha games run smoother than this. 5 months after release, and it feels like a disaster. I'm not sure any free weekend, or sale will salvage this which is a shame. I love the concept, I love the idea of it all and was always a huge Red Dawn fan....old one not the newest one...  I really wanted to like this and intended on keeping it no matter what, hoping it would get better but after an hour of seeing people getting stuck on obstacles, enemies ignoring me as I walked up to them and shot them to pieces...I couldn't force myself to continue. What a mess....
890	0	a	First off runs like crap even after the 'Fixes' someone said it pretty good that it does not matter how pretty your game looks if it does not run well at all.  Was quite boring. You will die a lot from stupid stuff and movement that seems so stiff it is hard to control. Bad story not as bad as the 1st game's story but just as dumb. Then there is the resistance.... Instead of getting things like camo body armor and anything that would be useful in an insurgency all of the resistance fighters went to Hot Topic instead.  The game is so predictable you can see every twist and turn. I honestly can't imagine what the season pass is going to do or come out with. MP is totally worthless as there seems to be no public matches unless you create one yourself and it is basically just the single player game but your not nearly as effective.  I wouldn't bother with this one.
891	0	a	Ok so let's talk about this game, this won't take long.   I was a big fan of the first Homefront even if it was a little generic. When this game was first announced I thought it had promise but as things progressed I started to get worried. In any case I picked it up and have played a few hours and I just can't play  anymore...why?  Is it bad, is it glitchy? Well no to the first question and maybe a little to the second question.  The big issue is that it's just soooooo generic and repetitive. The graphics are ok and I need to give the rain kudos for being some of the best rain in gaming, honestly the rain actually makes individual drops on the ground and things get wet in real time, it looks amazing! However when the best thing you can say about the game is the rain effects then you know it has problems.  The story makes little sense and gives you no reason to care about anything or anyone, the level designs are hollow boring sandboxes and the shooting is intially weak and wimpy. Things get better as you upgrade weapons but the problem is other than some strong enemies the gameplay never varies. It is like a standard sandbox game where you go to 'X' and press 'Y' to capture an area. Rinse and repeat over and over. There is some mindless catharsis in this but after a couple of hours it gets boring. Part of me wants to keep playing because there is a little fun to sniping enemy patrols but when you go from one generic city block to the next that fun quickly evaporates after 20 mins or so.  I didn't get any major bugs while playing but there were a lot of clipping errors during cutscenes and generally rough edges.  All in all it's an average shooter with bland level design and a ♥♥♥♥ poor story that makes it difficult to play for longer than 15-20 mins at a time.  5/10
2605	1	a	i have had fun with the game sort of still good betterthan the last but be warned this game is realy bugy and is better with controler but have as much fun with what ever you buy. :{D
892	0	a	  Expected more of the game! I feel there is no story, And voice spoken npc but not the main character? it feel dull and i feel 0% for the main charater  The open world is broken. If the army is trying to find you just climb up a roof or something and *poof* your gone, The bots dont even fly up to check you. Most of the army is just spawning in while you look at them, The riots make everything a piece of cake... Realllyy....  Just sad overalll. Wished the game was better...
893	0	a	Controls are sloppy, Enemy AI is rough at best. A lot of potential squandered by poor execution. Sounds familiar to the franchise.

895	0	a	you kill one and 5 respawns 5 meters away 
2607	1	a	Was unplayable before update 2.0  Since 2.0 I can play at 4K 60FPS no problem. I'm not sure if they've added SLI. But it runs just fine!   Thanks for finally fixing the performance issues!
896	0	a	Not worth $40. Just play it when it's free weekend.
897	0	a	I enjoyed the first homefront game quite a bit, although linear and feeling very outdated even upon release. I really wanted to try the second one. The reviews and outrage about the bugs, and constant glitches kept me away. After seeing the game on sale twice within two months I decided to give it a go for the heck of it.  I was very...disappointed. Even on max setting the game seemed to run ok, just up until you actually got to roam around. Within the first hour I ran across the same character models over...and over.

898	0	a	NOT A PERFORMANCE REVIEW!  The game itself does have some great fighting in it, as a first person shooter it holds its own, however, the controls on computer are not very well thought out, the tutorials that explain the game get thrown at you so fast on screen that you literally have no idea whats going on and the idea behing the whole 'Gorilla warefare' way to play is simply very vague and doesnt really appear apparent in the game.  All in all I refuneded this game because I don't believe the single player campaign warrants a $83 AUD (conversion at time of perchase) pricetag.
899	0	a	The game just feels un-finished. If you can get it for $5 or below it is worth it, but at its current price it is a rip off. So many glitches and in game freezes along with AI that is broken instead of smart. (The AI will zip off backward at 90MPH to dodge your bullets... The AI can dodge bullets.)
2609	1	a	Great story but bad Frame-Rate on the 970 &amp; i7 6700K although, on the new Pascals, its runs great on GTX 1070 FE OC &amp; i7 6700K O.C @4.4Ghz   Benchmarks on the 1070:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hxf3Kf_iNk  Benchmarks on the 970:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=honJ1BUbxsI  This game has a great potential but do we really need a 980 ti+ to run 60fps on 1080p? 
900	0	a	Repetitive, repetitive,repetitive,repetitive.   Worst Korea Best Korea. No Mp Few weapons despite an upgrade system I still found myself keeping toward mid to logn range engagements. Story was kind of bleh in all honesty it didn't feel as engaging as it could have been.
901	0	a	  Terrible view distance, objects pop in 30-40 feet away, game takes a severe graphical dip after the intro, stiff and lifeless facial animations, terrible stupid and non threatening AI (even on the hardest difficulty), lazy urban Farcry 2 gameplay. Unoptimized, uninspired, unworthy of your money. Even for free I could only stomach a couple hours.
902	0	a	3 times i reinstalled the game to no success! 0-20seconds in to the main menu it freezes and i have to close it from task manager.     S T A Y A W A Y !
903	0	a	got the game and refunded the game when it laged on a 960ti
2611	1	a	Just finished it, overall I enjoyed it, took me two days to finish it.  Played it on medium on a gtx 970 with 60 fps, still looked nice enough for me. Everybody keeps complaining about bugs, I got 3 crashes and everytime the game crashed the keyboard settings were mixed up. Still, that's not so many bugs. Oh and once a civilian NPC made me stuck in a corridor, so I ended up kiling him.   I wanted to play this game like an infiltration game, but the stealth part is a bit wooky-dooky if you know what I mean. Hs don't os with the silenced pistol so that makes it even harder.  I bought it for 23 euros and I don't feel like I wasted my money, 20 hours to finish and FPS is kind of unusual nowadays.  I haven't tried the coop part, I'll update my review once I have !
2613	1	a	It's like Far Cry, but in urban area and more enemies to shoot! Coop is pretty fun and rewarding too. Add me if you need someone to play coop with!
913	0	a	Refunded; a stuttering mess!
914	0	a	its a fun game but if you want the story just go watch someone play it on twitch or youtube. has almost nothing to do with the original Homefront witch people also thought didnt have a great story, somehow they managed to make the story evan worse. and all of that is just the start when you realize this has no multiplayer. sure it has resistance mode or whatever the ♥♥♥♥ that is but it dosent have a VS style multiplayer no Tdm ,no capture the flag ,no conquest, not like the original homefront witch had an amazing multiplayer, i recomend people use this as an example and decide to use the money the would have spent on this lacking game to go buy the first homefront for themselves and a few of there friends so the multiplayer servers can be populated again. Overall dont buy this game
915	0	a	loved the first game why open world?????????????? this game was going to be so awesome but they just had to f*** it up someway
2615	1	a	I've seen a lot of mixed reviews, but I'm really enjoying this game. The gameplay is a mashup of Call of Duty type combat mixed with the open-world territory capture of games like Far Cry. You have to capture points on a map until you control an entire area, and you choose whether to play stealth infiltration or go in guns blazing. If you can find this game on sale, it's a no-brainer to pick it up.
921	0	a	I had high hopes for Homefront: The Revolution. However; between disapointing AI, poor optimization, and limited coop I can't recomend this game. If you already have it, I suggest seeking a refund: because even if you can run this game well on your PC the single player campaign with its borderline braindead AI and pathfinding in its current state is simply not worth the full price. If you must have this game, get it when it goes on sale.
2617	1	a	  At a glance 72/100
2619	1	a	its fun and simple gameplay is solid, havnt encountered many bugs.
2621	1	a	Really good game i thought. It runs pretty great. The graphics and details within the world are incredible. The story while not amazing is pretty good. Surprising amount of variety in missions and how to acomplish them (not in terms of how you choose to get there more so how its set up for you to get there). The guns feel good and sound good.   The game can be quite challenging at times, you are not a super hero. Damage is quite harmful in this game, so you are forced to alter your play style constantly.  The game feels like playing Far Cry 3/4 but set in excellent war torn cities and towns to roam around.   Its surprisingly lengthy too, if you can be bothered to find everything and capture everything for every district.  Play it and make up your own mind.
2623	1	a	it always crashes right after the mayor gets killed dont know why otherwise its great know how to fix it? 
2625	1	a	If you liked Far Cry, you'll probably like this game too. Similar open world w/stronghold mechanics. And the weapon system is really unique and clever and I like it. I don't finish most games, but I expect I'll make it to the end of this one.  Also, unlike most similar games, I feel like enemy bullets are actually truly dangerous and it's easy to be stupid and get yourself killed. It takes very little damage to bring your health low, and it takes a long time to recover if you don't use a health kit. If you don't use cover or actually pay attention to your surroundings, you can die pretty fast. And I think this is a very good thing, it keeps the character from feeling overpowered even when you have a good arsenal, and it avoids the problem of enemy bullets just not feeling threatening. And conversely, enemies don't take too many bullets to kill either.
933	0	a	The optimisation... The glory optimisation, it's so good!  (sarcasm)
2627	1	a	I played now around 26 hours and this is what I have to say over Homefront the revolution It´s a good game beside the small bugs here and there  It runs kinda oke I got +-30 FPS on med high settings  co-op online mode is really nice build up with skills tree weapons unlocks  ( earn money in missions to buy stuff for your char )  and beside all the hate community and the small bugs of this game I will still give it a 7.5    
935	0	a	  I have mixed feelings about this game, although it has been advertised as a great game in the Homefront franchise (I guess it's a franchise now) it actually isn't. It is a rather boring game at the beginning but it seems like that for the whole game especially because some of the objective markers can be extremely far away but one problem that I have with this game is how easy it is to kill some of the AI on one of the hardest difficulties, I am familliar with these type of games but I don't know how the game works out. I only put it on the hardest difficulty and when I engaged in combat it was very easy to eliminate them but for some reason they didn't hit too hard when they shot at you. That's my problem with the game but this can probably become obselete as I have played too many shooters that act like this, my main point is that this game is awfully easy and I don't recommend it.
936	0	a	I played this on a free weekend. I believe it a very poor decision to have not made the main, open-world game-mode support co-op. I, and others, would have purchased if it did. Instead, we get a tacked on co-op 'mission' mode. Poor decision.
2629	1	a	-Free Weekend More of a ~ review than a + or - one. I have no pre-knowledge of this game. Summing the game up in two acronyms: F.P.S. A.C.    Overview/Pros
2631	1	a	100% Legit Cultural accuracy.  If you liked this game, you may also like: Rage Against The Machine - Killing In the Name  On a real note; Made me feel like an underdog and a rebel: And I liked it!
2633	1	a	I have to recommend this game if you enjoy a good shooter game with a decent story. If you are a fan of the first Homefront its a conflicted feeling to like this game though I have a huge BUT about the entire game. I hope that the single player missions that are coming out will address some of the issues I have with this game. I would also hope this is not the end to the Homefront series and that the developer is given a better directive on how to craft the story and give us a better open world.  I can't make my review based upon the first Homefront because it wouldn't be fair to this game. Which is why I recommend the game. However I will give my opinion.  1) The history behind Korea's takeover of America is very different in this game. I find the history in this game far less believable than the first game,  2) The story has many holes in it. I feel the game tried to be Mad Max, Farcry, Assassins Creed, Batman, etc in its execution of areas to liberate and cause the whole region to rebel. But how can you rebel in a sector when you got airships in the air above you? When enemies keep spawning?  3) The story was simplistic. You can tell in the first few minutes of the game that the game is setting you up to be the face of the resistance at the end of the story.  4) I don't feel this is open world because why go back to other sectors if they are at 100% rebellion already? Or go back when the storyline has left that area and won't be coming back to there.   I feel perhaps they kept the game they had from 4 years ago (story and design wise) and used the cryengine to make the game look spiffy. They succeeded with that but I feel there was a lackluster effort to give us a better story &amp; open world.  
940	0	a	  I could have written a better story which wouldn't be as dumb, meaningless and weak as this one from all angles. Characters are dull, main character Brady doesn't speak and everyone around him speaks for Brady and also everything related to revolution is up to Brady, so no one is trying to do anything to save their country except Brady. Cryengine and fancy graphics won't make it better. Consistent and rich story is what makes games fun to play not just graphics + gameplay.
941	0	a	The first two single player levels are based on the premise that you need to avoid the enemy and not kill them (because killing them calls in reinforcements). However, the game doesnt give you the normal tools of an avoidance game; i.e., no sneaking, no crawling, no means to kill without setting off alarms (e.g., radio jamming). They do give you the standard run and gun tools, which backfire here. So, this game (at least in the first two levels) appears internally inconsistent, making it more difficult than necessary.
2635	1	a	Imagine Homefront 1 mixed with Far Cry 3/4 and you have Homefront: The Revolution.   It shipped pretty broken but the devs seem committed and they have already released several patches.  Not a bad game at all; pretty average, but it's worth purchasing if it's going cheap!
944	0	a	a waste of 37.9GB runs well until you get into the open then it lags like someone tased my pc combat is boring and repetitive looks okay but its hard to admire the same dark wall and average lighting when youve seen it 20 times and your game lags whenever it renders more than a road sign, i couldnt even get out of the tutorial without my game jittering and freezing even though the fps counter said 50 overall, it is a boring and poorly made game with dissapointing combat and gameplay but has an okay weapon customization system.  
945	0	a	  Sadly while I want to recommend this game, I just can't at this point in time. I read with anticipation all the reviews stating that the latest patches had fixed all the problems. I was one of the apparently few people who really liked the first Homefront game a few years ago so I eagerly awaited this.  However, for me, this is still broken. I can play it for about 10 minutes and then it freezes, locks up and I have to stop it from the Task Manager. The frame rates are usually ok but occasionally lag pretty bad which speaks volumes about how unoptimized this game is given I'm running it on a GTX 980, plenty of grunt for 1080p gaming.  I think this will be a great game if the dev's keep working on it but right now I just can't recommend it.
946	0	a	the game is to choppy for me frame rate sucks
2637	1	a	I actually don't mind it, better than a large chunk of early access trash I've played and on sale costs much less.
2639	1	a	Huge improvement over the first but still feels rushed worth picking up on a cheap sale i would say £5 or so still has its share of bugs performance is erratic and character models seem to just apprear infront of you sometimes XD enemies and civilians
948	0	a	Was actually really keen to play and like this but despite the good graphics and cool idea, it has frame rate issues. Interiors were alright but as soon as i went outside it started chugging. im running a GTX970, 16gb ram, i7 2600 and even on Medium settings it had low FPS on exterior scenes. Apparently this is pretty common place with this game.
949	0	a	啥也别说了，删了。 Don't want to say nothing. Deleted.
950	0	a	Played this on a free weekend. Managed to complete the whole game on single player. Thought it was fun. No major issues. It looks pretty as well.  Tried to play multiplayer and kept getting error messages which upon research are pretty common. Gave up and deleted it from my library.  Would I recommend it based on my experience? No, unless it was on sale for £4-5 solely for the single player.
2641	1	a	Hugely underrated game - not without its flaws, but has excellent graphics, great gameplay (think Far Cry 3 in urban settings) and performs well after the updates.
952	0	a	The optimisation... The glory optimisation, it's so good!  (sarcasm)
953	0	a	The game crashes after the two guys knock you out, AMAZING!  Also #♥♥♥♥DENUVO
2643	1	a	it always crashes right after the mayor gets killed dont know why otherwise its great know how to fix it? 
2645	1	a	You will play as Tom Brady with ♥♥♥-kicking skills--Yeah he dashes and runs pretty good  A FarCry-like game in a more violent way.  No need to know the stories and all those characters, just shut up and blow some ♥♥♥♥♥ up  Would recommend it if you get to buy the entire game at $17.99, worth it!
2647	1	a	When o brought this game i was prepared to face a horrible and full of bugs game since i read a lot of bad reviews about it, but i got a rich and nice finished one ! Very Fun and with nice mechanics like the upgrade of weapons and customiations, a lot of gears to buy, 'open world' with good space and a lot of things to do ! Dun know why ppl want aways a triple A game and if its not they threat it like ♥♥♥♥, This game is cool. I not regret the buy. Game on.
2649	1	a	  *free weekend review*   Played smooth, no technical issues I noticed. Enviroments are cool, sun/night cycles on its own and weather patterns are cool for the immersion.   Unfortunately, its a game that despite have never played before until now, feels like I already had. Seems like it follows the Red Faction : Guerrilla scheme of things except as a FPS. Seemingly shoved along storyline you could easily cut through in a short time, if you didnt pay as much mind to the side missions, radiant missions, and 'find it' progression-% items hidden in different locations.  Overall its recommendable if your into the story and theme of the game. It had a rough release with technical issues, but seems to run fine now. Again, its just a game that dose feel like its been done before after an hours worth of playing.
963	0	a	Bought the game even if the rating are low, gave the game a try. It's exactly the type of game I was searching for, Single-Player FPS.  However, the game keeps crashing at the same point. Save file doesn't load.
2651	1	a	  I have only played it for two hours, I must say I like it and so far I have had NO issues on how it run on my system. Frame rates are 60 for the most part and as low as 40 yet rarely. It's a thumbs up from me.
2653	1	a	Best Game Within A Game  Couldn't care less about Homefront: The Revolution, just remaster Timesplitters 2 for Steam and we can all be happy.
2655	1	a	  Homefront: The Revolution is a mixed bag, but I think it ultimately prevails as an above average open world FPS. I played this game a good bit through its free weekend, and I enjoyed it. There's many reasons why its a mixed bag, so lets get to those reasons, shall we?   Positives
2657	1	a	Before I Begin this game is a Good game and that I enjoyed it, However just like with every game it has its bugs. From the FPS drops, Changes/Confusion/Turns in the Storyline/Dialogue that where confusing, the trouble with Multiplayer &amp; the Little to no Tie in to the First Homefront Game, where the Only problems with the game that I Found.   HOWEVER the general Outline of the story, progression, Weapon customization, level design where all really good and I really enjoyed it. Yes this game has had bad Backing and Reviews so Far but the Way I look at it is the Only True Review that someone can give or the Only True feedback someone can give is YOURSELF. Everyone has their own things that they like as Everyone is Different. So Try out the game because YOU want to.

965	0	a	Well I recommend it for its gameplay. But for me it has a game bug so I can't go further in the campaign. Tryed to uinstall and install again. Google searched the problem, but nothing. So its a thumbs down from me.
2663	1	a	I ♥♥♥♥ing love this game, it is mainly about territory which is so fun and that you have to hide and be stealthy about it just makes it even more exhilarating
2665	1	a	I ♥♥♥♥ing love this game, it is mainly about territory which is so fun and that you have to hide and be stealthy about it just makes it even more exhilarating
2667	1	a	Great game actually, unexpected.  Not the grindy Far Cry style open world, instead a relatively short 'do what you want' for some hours, more focus on others. If you like Far Cry, Mad Max, Crysis, Stalker this game is probably for you.  If you try this game out do not be discouraged by the bad and boring start, wait until you at least get into the yellow (civilian zone) after an hour or two since that is the real deal and makes the game what it is.  Ran without bugs, very smooth.
970	0	a	This is my review  Pros + graphics are okay  Cons - Poor Story - Poor AI - Poor performance - Poor voice actor - Poor poor suppressor it can use with pistol only - Poor freeze screen when you hit checkpoint  Verdcit: 6.5/10 i swear this is my true review ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)   Just don't buy this until discount on 50-70% kay ?
2669	1	a	I liked the game it was fun and everything, and the only reason I keep playing it just because I like the revolution idea. Its a fun game (if you can run it), and it also shows america in a diffrent way and not some strong force that plows through everyone. This game is fun but if your were do like $1 a hour I would wait to have it go on sale becuase right now at the moment I don't think its worth $60 plus since it didn't sell well sadly, rip I been waiting 4-5 weeks looking for 1 player to play coop with. It should have a sale soon but my opinions is my opinion and you do w/e you think suites you best. So it had fun gameplay for me, but just wait for it to go on sale and hope you can run it. If you don't know if you can run( I assumed a lot of people know the site but for those who don't) go to this site  http://www.systemrequirementslab.com/cyri 
971	0	a	I enjoy the game. I really do, but it's extremely hard for me to give it a recommnedation, even if its discounted heavily. It's not because of the broken AI (not stupid, they're literally broken), laughable model placement mistakes (floating cars, floating debris, clipping scenery, disappearing objects when you go near, etc), broken mechanics (Drones will hunt you across the map instantly if you ever ride a bike even if nobody sees you, when hiding in bins or protable toilets in yellow zones, enemies can actually still see you and will even try to kill you by shooting and throwing bombs but they can never hurt you and your wanted cooldown will still go down. It's pretty funny actually) or that the gameplay can be repetitive (thought personally, i don't find this to be a problem since I'm actually enjoying it).  The reason why I cannot in good faith give this a recommendation, again even if its heavily discounted, is because the game has the potential to literally ruin your computer physically. After beating halfway through Holloway (in terms of main missions), the game will HARD CRASH randomly during your playthrough from hencepoint onwards (sound will still continue to play as normal). It doesn't matter if you reinstalled the game, if you try to modify game files to make it more stable or have the latest updated version of the game. The game will crash on you so hard that it literally freezes your entire computer and your only option (unless you have a fast CPU and W10, which then you can try to 'log out of user' thereby forcing the pc to do a 'soft reset' by forcibly turning everything running off when it exits your Window user account) is to restart the computer.  Trying to turn just the .exe of the game alone either via task manager or right clicking to close via the task bar hardly helps. Sometimes it does turn homefront off after repeated tries, but overall doing either a full reset or as mentioned with signing out of your Window account is significantly faster and helps.  Literally I am losing files and getting system error messages (twice i even had to do a window restore because the game somehow destroyed/corrupted some important files) because of these sudden serious freeze to the whole PC because of the game. Seeing how this is very likely the final patch version of the game, i suggest you avoid this game unless you are willing to bear with the hard freezes, nevermind the glitchiness of the game itself.  Disappointing really. One of the most broken games I have ever played thus far. And what makes it worse is that I actually personally find the game enjoyable despite it glitches and understandably repetitive gameaplay.  My rig loadout is on my profile if you need reference on my rig capabilities. Also another note is that if you're using RGB products such as keyboards (Corsair K70. Apex M800), mousepads (Razer firefly, Apex MM880) and mice (Rival 700, Razer Mamba new, Sensei Wireless, M65 Pro RGB) the game WILL freeze your lighting (another indication that the game has some serious software issue). Headsets RGB doesn't seem to be affected by it for some reason, same goes for any RGB lighting for your case such as RGB fans and NZXT Hue+.   I'm not sure if the issue is because of Nvidia cards since I'm running 2 1070 (i tried running the game with and without SLI, problem still persists), so i can't say the same for AMD users. Nevertheless take it a cautionary note

2677	1	a	its ok, a bit laggy but i bought half price at amazon on disc! So buy on sale or after next patch!
977	0	a	I played and thoroughly enjoyed the original Homefront, so I was eagerly anticipating the release of Homefront: The Revolution. In total I've committed about 13 hours to it, and I have completed both the campaign and most of the strikepoints. The length of the game is far shorter than many have claimed, but it still is longer than average for most AAA titles. Whilst I enjoyed what I played, I can't recommend the game until the AI and optimisation are fixed, as these two are critical in holding it back.  A few things worth noting.  Graphics - Although it may be poorly optimised, the game is quite aesthetically pleasing. The environment has quite a lot of detail, and is fairly immersive for an open world game. AI - is broken and needs a full overhaul. The AI suffers from pathfinding issues, and is generally dumb in combat often charging in wrecklessly. Optimisation - Througout my playthrough I had my settings on Ultra (aside from AA) and was playing at a resolution of 2560x1440. Unfortunately the game lacks an SLi profile (attempting to use Nvidia Inspector to force it creates a broad array of graphical issues). Forgettable generic characters
2679	1	a	Just bought the game, Just started the first area. It's alot like farcry. So far the story is ok, And the gameplay is fine. I don't understand why people gave it such bad reviews. IF you like farcry you WILL like this game.  Edit: Just finshed the game, It was good. I still can't understand why it got bad reviews??? Yes, the AI is not the best but it was still fun.

980	0	a	I was really excited when Homefront:the revolution was announced as an open world game. I didn't play the first game in the series more than a few hours for a plethora of reasons. I even waited when reviews were somewhat spotty at best on this game. This new itteration of the Homefront series has some good quirks and some bad. Let's start with the pros shall we? On the list of pros Homefront presents a somewhat large open world for you to bring freedom to. It seems to breathe, it seems to move and be legitimately animated. When I first started playing I was absorbed into the world and excited to explore it. The next pro would definitely be the weapons. Although there isn't a large variety to be had with this game, what it does let you have are a few archetypes that can be customized to your liking (pistol, shotgun, assault rifle, sniper rifle) and each of these weapons has a feeling that it is scrounged up and hastily put together for a fight with a better equipped enemy. There is also crafting of implements of destruction here as well, mostly just your run of the mill grenades, molotovs, mines... and then you also have a few cool rc bombs and drones at your disposal. I feel like these are the main things the game does really well. On the bad side however I will open up to a list of the cons. The game feels rushed , even with the patches out for it so far (6-7ish months after release). Framerat can stutter at times even on a higher end rig. There is also the problem of render distance for the ai. I've seen many times in game where enemy ai can just suddenly disappear, even while you are looking at them. As you can imagine this hinders players who like to use sniping as their main playstyle. This has even happened up close in many tight quarters firefights. Next up is the gunplay, now to me , the gunplay can seem very blocky and almost robotic feeling. It's nice to have interesting tools of the trade, but if they all feel very robotic or almost clunky to operate that takes away part of the fun of having them. One of the final cons I'm going to touch on is the fact that the ai is very poor. The enemy ai seems to be able to predict where you are at instantaniously and almost without warning at all. They also seem to be able to hit you as soon as you start engaging them, I have very rarely been missed by an ai ever in this game. The health system does little to nothing to help this as when you are playing on the hardest difficulty , if you get hit once you're already dead pretty much. That wouldn't be a big deal if the ai weren't all competition grade shooters. Anyways, if you are looking for a fix on an insurgant like game. I suggest you pick up a game like Red Faction Guerilla instead. I had such high hopes for this game and was disappointed by what I had actually recieved.
2683	1	a	Meh just far cry 4 with a few more features, nice graphics and poor optimization, Could've been better but i think it's okay.
2685	1	a	You will play as Tom Brady with ♥♥♥-kicking skills--Yeah he dashes and runs pretty good  A FarCry-like game in a more violent way.  No need to know the stories and all those characters, just shut up and blow some ♥♥♥♥♥ up  Would recommend it if you get to buy the entire game at $17.99, worth it!
982	0	a	Well I recommend it for its gameplay. But for me it has a game bug so I can't go further in the campaign. Tryed to uinstall and install again. Google searched the problem, but nothing. So its a thumbs down from me.
2687	1	a	I ♥♥♥♥ing love this game, it is mainly about territory which is so fun and that you have to hide and be stealthy about it just makes it even more exhilarating
2689	1	a	Great game actually, unexpected.  Not the grindy Far Cry style open world, instead a relatively short 'do what you want' for some hours, more focus on others. If you like Far Cry, Mad Max, Crysis, Stalker this game is probably for you.  If you try this game out do not be discouraged by the bad and boring start, wait until you at least get into the yellow (civilian zone) after an hour or two since that is the real deal and makes the game what it is.  Ran without bugs, very smooth.
985	0	a	  A stale, unfinished game. Honestly, I love the concept of playing as part of a guerrilla resistance, but this game follows the boring trends of all the other open world first person shooters. Clear out this base, it is now your base, get rewards, repeat. This repetitiveness on top of a generic story that tries too hard to make you care for a character two seconds before they die for dramatic emphasis and endless clipping, pop in, and other technical issues makes me not want to play this even for free.

2691	1	a	Most slept on game of the decade, it's fall out for mixed with assassin's creed with a hint of fable esc story telling. I didn't buy it because of the reviews but got it on sale just for poops and giggles.... I hate single player games.... I didn't really like fall out 4... but this game, the universe, it really draws you in. I recommend it on sale, or with the money you got back from.no mans sky
988	0	a	Game is unfinished, Full of bugs etc. etc. Waste of money. Enemies spawn behind of your back in corner you just cleared. You get stuck in objects. I dont normaly rage quit games, this one made me do it 3 times in same day.

2693	1	a	It is free for the weekend so i try the game and it still is heavy on the machine and it got some minor bugs.. but for the 13 hours i played it plays like any other far cry game there is so its good for me, im gonna buy
995	0	a	after purchasing this game, this is my review + graphic is beautiful + far cry based game with north korean invasion on america + weapon customization + conversion  - BUG BUG BUG!!! - story is not too interesting - weapon attachments not pleasing me, need more of them or add camo customization  55/100 from me 65/100 if bug has solved
2695	1	a	People hate this game, but what other game allows you to get blue balls by Anne Frank?  http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0853364/?ref_=tt_cl_t2 
2697	1	a	Outside of a few framerate dips here and there the games runs fine for me. Loving the story and the gameplay reminds me of Far Cry 3 or 4. The game definitely makes you feel outmanned and outgunned. Guns are solid and responsive and modding them is a blast. All around great game to me. Having said that because of optimization issues wait for a sale or a few patches to pick up. 8/10 from me.
1000	0	a	Totally unrealistic.  First lets start off with the fact that everybody in the world loves North Korea. So, if we liberated the Americans from their capitalist opressors they would be jublient about the fact that they now live under me, Kim Jong Un. Second, because most Americans live in tents, eat birds and snow, and buy guns to kill each other, they would have no effecive logistical means to supply a effective resistance. Third, its a well known fact that everyone who lives in North Korea is very happy all the time. Those who are not happy are sent to 'Happiness Camps' where they re-learn how glorious the DPRK is compared to the rest of the world. In fact they love me so much in North Kore I always get 100% of the vote because they all love me so much. Anyway, this propaganda piece is nothing more then just lies being pushed by Obama, George W bush, the South Korean government, the Japanese government, and the American CIA.
1001	0	a	Imagine buying a car, it looked cool in the pictures, drove smooth in the TV ad and gave you a sense that life would be better when you owned your very own. The price was reasonable, it had all the parts, but when you get in the door opens with screech, the key required a little force to get into the ignition and it reluctantly starts up after turning over a few times.   Your first ride is rough and bumpy, there's strange noises coming from everything, so you find yourself deviating from your course home to feel out the problems with a few detours, twists and turns, trying to pinpoint the issues it seems to have with the steering. The air-con doesn't seem to hold the right temperature, so you wind down the electric window, only to find there's a slight stutter as it drops a few steps, rather than giving a smooth wind. The stereo is only picking up a few stations with a bit of static, you can't find a good song and the talkback channels are a bit annoying, the off switch doesn't seem to work, so you just have to turn the volume down to 0%. You wanna have a cigarette to calm your nerves and frustration, but there's no lighter or ash tray, even so, you can't be bothered pulling into the 7-Eleven to buy a lighter, because you just wanna get the damn thing home and assess the whole deal, so you just imagine how good it would have been to have a smoke with your cool new ride.  You've driven around in the built up areas for a while now, the GPS has led you astray a few times and the route path seems quite disjointed, so you decide to jump on the freeway and open up before you dump it home and watch a movie to get your mind off things, there only seems to be four gears that grind into place even with the softest clutch control, and the engine has a limiter on, so you can't even let some frustration out by breaking the speed limit, but even then, the fuel gauge starts beeping and you've just hit reserve level.  You get it Home and park out Front, giving the thing a bit of gas in neutral to test The engine Revolution, which is a little underwhelming, but for some reason you're not entirely upset, but more disappointed with your new car, it has a slightly unique shape and colour from other cars, but the same stock-standard cheaply sourced parts from various suppliers, that don't seem to have been oiled or put together properly. Quality control was probably a bit slack, and you get the feeling this model was rushed into production to meet demand.  You find yourself having to shoulder-barge the door open to get out, the button doesn't work to remotely lock the doors and set the alarm, so you have to go back and lock it manually. Pulling the key out, you realise the back left tire is flat, but you just walk inside and throw the car keys on the floor, crack open a nice cold beer and wonder why you hadn't read any reviews about the car, waited a little longer before buying a brand new model or just taken it back to the dealer instead of driving all the way home. You're not entirely bummed though, it may be because you're equipped with those silly human traits of faith and hope, so you decide you'll leave it for a while, wait for a tow truck and let the mechanics sort it out eventually, because with a bit of oil, some fine tuning and a few added features, this car could one day be a sweet ride. But for now, you'll just use your trusty old whip to get you around.
1002	0	a	There are so many other shooters out there with a much better story. i have just finished to the story line and i can safely say i will never be replaying this game. it will be deleted and never reinstalled.. there is not a single point in the game where you are surpirsed or where the is something you can get excited about. this game is for me the last nail in the coffin for homefront series... Homefront R.I.P
1003	0	a	Really wanted this game to be good, I'd of loved to of give a positve review. As I haven't finished this game and don't really intend to I can't speak of the later campain.  Starting off with the first few mission on the game it seemed like it was going to be very story driven introducing you to the characters and making out you were relatively new to this 'freedom fighter' role. After the first few missions are over you're thrown into a massively open world with no real sense of purpose, you'll get your main missions that are accessed through your phone that seem to send you to a new area everytime and then there's a load of side missions that don't seem to progress anything at all and there is no consequence to not doing them.  Then you have the zone capturing to get on with slowly freeing the area from the KPA and if the first zone is anything to go by you might as well not bother because it will get rid of the enemies and well... there's just no point, weapons and equipment all seem tied to the main mission regardless of these zones. Yellow zones play out a little differently as you can pretend you're a civilian in these areas and supposedly blend in with the crowd, yet for some reason every guard instantly recognises you like you're some big shot rebel guy even after only one mission. When you're spotted in these zones you'll get an alert status meaning every guard in the area will start shooting you and actively persue you, so you'll have to hide as endless waves of enemies will spawn until the alert status has passed.  The multiplayer is kind of fun for a bit but I only really got a few hours out of it as it only has like 5 missions, you can get new gear and such from supply boxes which just give you random crap, as far as I can tell you just need to buy weapon packs until you have the weapon you want but it really is pointless because there's a really limited amount of missions to use them on.  Well to sum it up I'm just really dissapointed, I loved the first game as it felt like you were actually helping america fight for freedom in this one it just feels like you're mindlessly following the star shaped objective marker. 0/10
1004	0	a	Alot of people thinks that homefront 1 was a ♥♥♥♥ game. Which i DO NOT agree with. The story was 'meh' but the multiplayer was alot of fun.  But heres the problem. First of all this game does not have multiplayer like in homefront 1, only 'coop'. And the frame rate is horribble. I had big hopes about this game but nah. I do not recommend this
2699	1	a	For nomination of 'Game within a Game' award. Finding timesplitters in this game caught me totally off guard. Was so engrossed I forgot I was playing homefront.  For the game itself, it had a lot of potential and played surprisingly well. I didn't ever get the feeling that I could take on the world, which is exactly what I wanted in a Guerrilla warfare type game.  However, the gadgetry could do with being a bit fleshed out. Plus the enemy AI could've used a bit of work. I think I actually enjoyed the story of the first homefront more tbh.  With respect to multiplayer, as much as I liked the multiplayer in the original homefront, I'm not particularly bothered its gone.
1005	0	a	A waste of time.Stupid and boring campaign,bad game mechanism.Not smooth free-running and shooting .The pleasure was always interrupted by stupid AI.
2701	1	a	 Homefront: The Revolution Honest Review
2703	1	a	Obviously could run better but I had no issues keeping between 80-120 fps so far, and the side missions are quite varried and interesting to evolve your play style and movement before advancing to the next stages of the campaign. For what the game went through to get released and me getting it for thirty some dollars, its worth picking up for a good single player. Merica.
2705	1	a	Before it start this review i dont see how so many ppl are having issues with this game. Got a steady 57-60 fps the entire game, no lag or crashes. This homefront is a HUGE IMPROVEMEMT from the FIRST HOMEFRONT!! The action in this game will have you smilling from the start to the end. I enjoyed how they made it open world and almost half the building you come across you can enter them.   Pros -takes 8hours to beat (NOT INCLUDING SIDE MISSIONS) -Convert your weapons to a whole new gun -Drive bikes -Animations are done very well -Voice acting is good -Open world/ Graphics are sexy -upgrade your character and weapons -Small shops and stores to buy items -side missions -STORY IS AMAZING -Atmosphere   Cons -Cant get one achievement 'Practical Mayhem' -Once you beat the game you cant go back and roam the map again -Attachments are limited per weapon example: Ar cannot place a silencer but you can place on a rifle or pistol. -Getting away from the KPA is TOO EASY!! -Lip sync is kinda off -Bugged achievements (beating the game, upgrading weapons, killing heavy, etc) EASY FIX JUST VERIFY CACHE START GAME AND END IT AND YOU SHOULD EARN THE ACHIEVEMENTS YOU DIDNT GET IN GAME!
1007	0	a	most laggy, most porly optimized game ive ever seen... worse than Ark and Space engineers.... DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PIECE OF FILTH!!!
1008	0	a	i like the concept of the game but the in isnt worth 60 dollars more like 15 - 20
1009	0	a	The missions are not randomized. The gunplay is not awesome. The coop works better than the campaign but there are very few missions and its get to point. defend horde, move to next point, defend horde. The graphics and the sound work are great. The game has a ton of work to be done on optimization as 90% of the users cant play it on pc on max settings on PC's that should be able to blow the game out of the water. A streamer who runs 3 Titan X's was getting 19 fps.  The Coop is still the best part of the game. It is very similar to the Dragon Age Inquisition Multiplayer where you go on a mission. Do the SAME mission each time you play it. Get xp and reward. Use your earned money to buy crates that give you weapons, attachments, boosters, gear, and cosmetics.   The campaign is trying to be 10 different games at once that don't blend all that well together. The driving part of the game is vomit inducing. The gunplay itself is pretty bad. It feels overly clunky and it doesnt flow well at all.   On easy the mobs will fill you with bullets at times and not hurt you at all. Then the same person shooting at you will 2 shot you. It is extremely inconsistent and infuriating. Badly designed.   Chances are if a person is claiming the game is great they either have bad taste, or are a hipster and like going against the grain.   I will have a full review at a later date for this game on  www.TheDrastikMeasure.com  but at this time the game is soooo bad I can't play it in it's current state.   Devs have to know the game was bad right? What is the thought process of releasing the game anyway ? The devs of the game even knew it was bad because in the credits they apologize for it and comment on it's troubled development. Was Deep Silver not willing to shell out more funding to help fix the title? Instead hey they IP will sell itself, lets rob our community ? I would love to know the thought process and inner workings of this game, the publisher and developer relationship.
1010	0	a	  on first sight,. the game looks amazing.  then when you start to play it, you realize it isn't a game at all,.. it is one giant bag of bugs.  seriously, this is the buggiest game ever. it would be SO great if the devs payed attention or gave two ♥♥♥♥♥ about what they were doing.  this could be AMAZING.. but it is not even worth the sale price,..   I don't even recommend playing it for free unless you have unlimited bandwidth like me,.. since it's a 40gb download / delete
1011	0	a	You know what... i think i perfer the last homefront game......................and the gameplay , well it's a Farcry 3 clone and looks nowhere near as good. The story is ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥ too and its broken as ♥♥♥♥. Could it be good when they fix it?...no i can't.   pro's it passes the time   cons rubbish story a half arsed Farcry 3 gameplay unfinshed level design. yes thats right. i saw floating signs without any poles missing walls with half the terrain missing on the other side and a few missing textures. Floating people yep this is like a bad early access game. stiff face animations sometimes it like watch a badly acted emotionless b movie The background crowd voices are on a loop so they will eventually drive you ♥♥♥♥ing crazy.  This is probably the worst released game i've played since X-rebirth.   http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=688379714    http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=688379595    http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=688379736    http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=688379761    http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=688379785

Another bug Made a new a game and some how got spawned on the last level checkpoint. Achievements that i have not completed are unlocking from doing nothing. The voice acting is on point! and the weapon conversion is pretty dope along with adding attachments!
1018	0	a	Great concepts bogged down by horrible performance. Going to put this on hold in hopes of some major patches to resolve, until then I can not recommend even more so if not on sell.
1019	0	a	just feel like this game is a cheaply made game....
1020	0	a	This game is a waste of time. Do not pay for this game. You will regret it.  
1021	0	a	uhm..dont buy it now, just wait for update. the game still buggy, got fps down even on lowest settings  i bought this game only 28$ so its worth a try
1022	0	a	Yes, it is as bad as the reviews say.
1023	0	a	I have two gtx 98 tis and i can barely get it to run at 60 in 1080p. The frame rate sucks so bad, that I won't even try until they fix it.
1024	0	a	Worst hacking simulator
1025	0	a	  Stay Away  Glad I decided not to preorder this game. I played during the free weekend and it's loaded with bugs and performance issues. Game will freeze for up to 2 1/2 minutes during firefights and regular loading time (like objective updates).  Graphics are great however overall they rushed this out the door due to hype just to cash in.
1026	0	a	This game busted by dam Buster studio,at least Steam refund work perfectly
1027	0	a	the game is still glitchy even after the patch. I was looking forward to playing this game but after about an hour or two the game becomes unplayable. i would have thought when they or if they tested the game they would have noticed the poor performance. I suppose there is nothing we can do except keep up the complaints and hope they decide to get there finger out and actually do something about it. I give it a well deserved 3/10 do not buy if your smart.
1028	0	a	There is a glitch during my gameplay,campaign mission 'power the people' cant be complete. This mission is to raise the hearts &amp; mind to 100%,I found some safehouse,destroyed some enemy technicals.but no matter what i do,it just stay 0%. At the map of Ashgate,whith is this mission area,all strike points are not shown.
1029	0	a	This game sucks the sweat off a dead man's balls !!!!! I pre purchased the game and installed it when it became available. This was my worst mistake. From day 1, I could not get started due to the extremely slow and choppy framerate. No matter what I did, I could not get it to run correctly. All I can say is be warned....... This game is a real Piece of ♥♥♥♥ !!!!!
2707	1	a	Whilst this game has had very mixed press and user feedback I can honestly say that i am thoroughly enjoying it. The mix of stealth with run and gun keeps me wanting to push on through the missions, regardless of how unlikely the plotline is. Having read lots of poor feedback on the game and lack of mission variety i can honestly say that i have found the game to be as enjoyable as i found Far Cry 3 and Assassins Creed. Yes it still has issues, most noticeably around the spawn in and out of enemies which can be random and which do affect continuity at times. Having said that i would not say that this in any way detracts from the playability of the game and with the weapon variety you will find lots of ways to push through the KPA checkpoints, THe graphics and feel of the Philadelphia setting and oppressing actions of the KPA are a great feature and I would whole heartedly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys the FC3's of this world. Yes it has bugs, yes it can sometimes drop frames but on a GT970 and i7 i am seeing 55 - 60 fps consistently and really enjoying it. My advice: if you are looking for a polished AAA shooter then go buy Doom. If however you want something a bit less mindless (and challenging) then you could do a hell of a lot worse than play Homefront The Revolution. 
1031	0	a	Worst hacking simulator
1032	0	a	Don't bother the game is 10 years 2 late, and horribly unresponsive and badly optimised. sad was looking forward to it, maybe its better on PS4 who knows. about the same level of disapointment with Enemy Front.

2709	1	a	I don't get all the hate comments for this game, it's a really good game once you play it for a few hours. It has an awesome campaign, a good story and a bunch of things you can do once you finish it. The only thing that kind of bothers me is that it can bug out sometimes, like getting stuck for no reason and stuff like that. Also, I wish it was better optimized for PCs, but whatever.
1034	0	a	This game tries so hard to be what Wolfenstein The New Order was, and it fails miserably. Holy hell does it fail miserably.
1035	0	a	really sad... unplayable mess even on high end hardware... just read other reviews...  i just ask for a refund...
1036	0	a	Okay massive fan of the first Homefront it had flaws but the campaign just clicked with me cheesy 80's throw back story arcadey fps loved it. The sequel oh wow so much wasted potential, first off if you were hoping to pick up at the end of Homefront nope ignores it completely.  Combat wise well it's an fps you point you shoot enemies die. It does not have deep mechanics but it does have a pretty good weapon customization design. You can basically turn any of the 6/7 main types of gun into three other weapons for example the pistol can be converted to an SMG and to a silcenced single shot pistol etc.  The AI is pretty basic playing on Normal difficulty they seem to run straight at you or just past you in an attempt to get to cover, though it is fairly easy to get overwhelmed in the more combat intensive red zones.  The main story campaign is okay not as interesting as the first homefront story at least to me, the open world sections feel like massive padding you do the same two or three types of side mission 6/7 times you free a zone and then you move onto the next one for a total of 12 zones I am currently slogging my way through zone 6 i think at this point I doubt I will finish it.   Bottom line if you want to give it a try wait for a steam sale, or a free weekend because i have a feeling the way multi player is dropping off a free event cannot be too far behind.
1037	0	a	Most regret buying this game, tons of bugs so inconvenient in story progress
1038	0	a	Pre ordered for the pre order bonus, got nothing(Yes I looked up how to get it) 10/10 would buy the game again
2711	1	a	Its good
1040	0	a	  Homefront: The Revolution is an unfortunate case of the whole being less than its parts. It’s clear there were a number of unique ideas being bandied about during the development of this game, and there’s certainly shadows of those ideas in the full release, but its “me too design fails to come together in any meaningful way. As a complete package, it struggles on many levels to deliver, chiefly, the story and gameplay. With time, many of the bugs should be fixed, and who knows, maybe the DLC offered post-release might improve on the story. At the moment, from former Free Radical developers, Homefront: The Revolution is nothing less than a disappointing, if not outright terrible game.
1041	0	a	I was reminded of this game about 12 hours before it came out. I purchased in haste after reading a brief overview of the Game, and as soon as I saw 'Crytek Engine' I made my purchase.   I regret that decision. It's not the worst game in the world, but the fact they are charging $60 for this unfinished, buggy title is a bit dissapointing.   Graphically, not terrible, but it performs poorly even on sufficient hardware. They are supposedly supposed to improve this with upcoming patches, if so then this game is not bad in the Graphics department, but a lot of Texture work is subpar. You can tell they cut a lot of corners on this to get it out there. Lighting and overall 'look' still trump CoD IMO, which still looks like the first Modern Warfare with better Textures and lighting. That series also suffers from performance issues.   Gameplay is very basic. A lot of control point missions, nothing fancy. AI isn't great. In the end you basically run around shooting stuff, taking over bases. If that's enough to keep you occupied then you aren't going to find much else to do. It's the same stuff they've been putting out for 10+ years. Also, there's 1 vehicle, and it's a Dirt Bike. Nothing special, it gets you from Point A to Point B.  I'm not going to hold a grudge against the Developers, as they were put in a crappy situation. They may still redeem themselves with future Addons\Updates, but at this time I can't recommend this game at it's current price point. I just purchased the Original Ghost Recon Series for $10 on sale and I will probably get a lot more play time from those games.   -Justin    
1042	0	a	I'm happy i didnt buy this, this game is a waste of any monay you put into it, its optimization sucks ♥♥♥ and you cant do ♥♥♥♥ about it 1/10 cliche story and lame characters DON'T BUY THIS GAME
2713	1	a	one of the worst game i've ever player -_-  But co-op is too much fun man &lt;3 fall in love with the co-op but if u dont have co-op partner then dont buy the game it will not worth the money -_-   *-too much problem with the story  *-repeative missions  *-fu**ing bugs(now fixed myb)  *-worst combat  --  +good grapics  +good sound  +good weapon customization  ~_~
2715	1	a	  -Great game -Amazing storyline -didn't pay for it
1043	0	a	!!!!!DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!!!  The story is okay, but everything else is terrible. The gunplay is janky as hell, the movement controls are terrible, it's super glitchy, and it doesn't run very well.  If you do buy do not pay full price.
2717	1	a	i dont know about the original homefront but so far im LOVING homefront the revolution    its open world (which i love) its a FPS (which i love) its got gun customization (which i love) its a alternate history story (which i love) and its pretty (which is nice)   basically the story's set up (which is also the alternate history part) is basically what if steve jobs was never born BUT a north korean steve jobs was born instead
2719	1	a	Quick Review:  Pros -Plays a bit like Farcry 3-4( if you like those games) -A nice weapon customization  -Good Graphics -okay to decent gun fights -A.I actually hunts you down for once in a game and not for 20 seconds or so -The best easter egg you will ever see and use  Cons -First part of the game has bad fps i hit around 35-45fps on high settings. but then after a bit goes to the 60fps -not fully open world like Farcry and other open world games. but still big maps -A.I which you have asked can block the way this has happened about 3-4 times atm ( only way to solve issues is to kill them or wait a bit and push out of the location works every time for me) -CANT DESTROY THEM SHIPS WITH ANYTHING -no multiplayer or other game modes( i know it has co-op for set missions but a survival or co-op for campaign would be good) -Story should be better -bug in the 2x supersample ( change to 1x and runs fine)   5-6/10 not worth the cash amount now wait abit if you wanna get or get it, its up to you.      Balanced review Well, We are all quick to point the finger. But this games development was not a simple A to B as it were. The game went all over the shop, loss of funding and time wasted. Am sure if it went from A to B then this game would actually be alot better.  Gameplay is similar to far 3 and 4, + crysis games. But you take alot more damage. You will die alot till you get used to the game. A.I is actually difficult in some spots and in certain zones always think twice.(AI can hunt you down which is nice for once) The cry engine again shows good graphics. Weapon customization on the go is good and crafting (If only you could craft a dam health kit)  The first part the performance is not great even with the settings on high i was getting 35-45fps. after 2mins after that i get 58-60s+ on high settings. There is some windows that you have trouble entering which is annoying. But you get that with mosts games.   I am playing on medium difficulty at the moment and still the A.I fights of friendly and enemies are for the most part ok. Some areas are bad they do little damage to each other, other times the A.I are just insane. e.g A friendly A.I takes out a patrol and a car then some reason follows you around( i Didn't ask it to) Darn that A.I survived a long time and i died less times because of it.  Maps are big but fails to deliver the full open world exp of a much larger map then sections. The bike can be annoying at times. but just get use to it No change to the gameplay as it progresses or change to the phone thingy task  I encounted not many problems throughout playing this game, ok theres certain places are better then others. but no harmfull bug's stopping gameplay or missions. just my poor skills at being stealth. Changing keys works fine for me no problems and i swopped wasd for tfgh to try it out for a bit.  last this thing, one of the best easter eggs i have ever come across.and works fine.
1050	0	a	capture the police station bug. need start game again. many bugs. no support
1051	0	a	waste of time-just bad 
1052	0	a	Not really fun because is lagging too much and is not really realistic
1053	0	a	After putting some good time into this game I can say that the thing is playable.. but there is so many problems with it. I hope it gets some good patches, it could be fun. It feels like it's release was rushed because there is some ugly looking graphical errors and glitches in the game. And they're very obvious, say goodbye to your immersion!
1054	0	a	Not ready for release yet

1057	0	a	The game is freezing! 1/10
1058	0	a	No I did not play this for long. I love the graphics, the setting, the kinda feeling. I love hiding in buildings from a scanning airship and drones flying around. I love the weapons, the swapping system, even the liberation and I adore the melee kills.  But then it does some things wrong, the story which I can look past, is dull and to easy to ignore since it doesn't really pull you in. The performance which again I can look past is horrible, The one thing I just couldn't stand, the one thing i couldn't do was the gameplay. The way the game played, it's just such a simple shooter. I was hoping for more depth, cover systems, refined squad tactics. Maybe I play too many simulators but I stopped playing COD for a reason and this game is why.  If you want is a generic shooter to kill time then please by all means get it, but please not for more than $20 it just is not worth more than that.  My performance so you can benchmark yours too mine: I hovered around 40-60FPS, 60 only in silent closed spaces with almost nothing around. While in a intense place I saw my FPS drop to 30's though this was uncommon, it usually averaged at around 40-45FPS.  My Specs for comparison:  Gigabyte R.990FXA-UD5 R5 Mobo HyperX Fury Black 16Gig DDR3 1866Mhz RAM Asus GeForce GTX 1060 ROG STRIX OC 6Gig AMD FX-8370 8-core CPU overclocked to 4.8GHz  I hope this helps someone decide to get it or not. I personally did not enjoy my time. I even uploaded my time with it to YouTube.
1059	0	a	  Was toying with the idea of picking this up, and the free weekend was my chance to see if it lived up to the high standards set by the first game. It didn't. The game seems to be a reboot of the Homefront series, rather than a sequel. In the first game, the North Koreans overpowered South Korea, then Japan, and allied with China to invade the US. In this game, North Korea is portrayed as affluent and technologically advanced, allowing them to invade America after the US defaults on a loan. Seeing as N. Korea has something like the 3rd largest standing army in the world, the first scenario seems much more likely and realistic to me. I see a lot of people throwing around the word 'unplayable' on Steam recently, but by and large, I think people are overreacting. This game isn't glitchy and bug-ridden to the point of being unplayable, just unenjoyable. Many times, I would enter a safehouse without the game registering that I had entered a safehouse. This means I could still fire my weapon, even killing everyone inside, often without my allies' weapons even loading into their hands. The AI is honestly some of the worst I've ever seen in a modern game. Countless times I have mowed down a KPA soldier, with his buddies standing not 10 feet away, with no reaction from them. Other times, specifically in yellow zones, I've been on the run from the KPA, and I've made a single turn, or hid behind something directly in the KPA's path, and they've simply given up the chase. I know a lot of people who really want to like this game (and believe me, I REALLY wanted to love it) will look at my almost 4 hours playtime and think 'that's not enough to judge this game by', and it kills me to say that it really is. Within 3.7 hours, I bought every gun and upgrade, with only a handful of the game's districts unlocked. This game truly has nothing else to offer me, aside from buggy character animations, a truly broken spawn system, and a drab, uninspired story. I've played games that are much, much worse. But for the reduced price of $24, you could certainly do much better. Thanks for the free weekend, Homefront, but no thanks.
1060	0	a	awsome graphics, but lowsey gameplay, player hard to control, items vauge. difficult to tell what is colectable/not. targeting is very hard. I love fps. This one is beautiful but looks are in this case are pixel deep. glad I only paid $39 for whole set not the steam price through cdkeys online.
1061	0	a	  I loved the first Homefront. This sequel is a shameful attempt at continuing the series.  I've barely played it in co-op and I can already tell it suffers from some of the telltale signs of a bad game such as: -Even on Easy it's too hard (you die in a few shots, that's not easy) -VoIP with no push to talk is enabled on by default -Generic menu that looks like a Call of Duty/F2P ripoff/clone. -Generic Mission-Style coop system -Dropping my coop partner and I into combat not 5 seconds after the mission began (no time to take in mission objective or surroundings) -Guns using generic sound effects instead of the unique ones that the first Homefront presented  I suppose it's not horrible, it's just same old same old with a lot of problems. Meh. It's a really poor follow up to the original game.  
1062	0	a	Just beat the game, may i say: I Cringed all the way through it.
2723	1	a	  As someone who had gone into this knowing that it was riddled with bugs, I was pleasantly suprised by what I got. While some of the characters felt shallow and underdeveloped, and a few (painful at times) minigames, and amount of guns left me wanting, I still found a game with great gunplay, amazing setting, clearly dedicated developers, fantastic level design, and more things then I can list. The soundtrack admittedly could've been much better and varied, but all things cnsidered, this is a prime example of devs listening to what fans had to say, taking it to heart, and actually using it. I rate it a strong 8 to a weak 9 out of ten.
1069	0	a	Homefront has all the right ideas, a story, large open world, different mechanics it all seems good. However the execution of these ideas leads to one of the worst games ive play while having the ideas I love. Its story falls short on importance, its open world suffers from buggy gameplay with far to few weapons and equipment. The A.I are a joke, friends cant hit anything and enemies kill you with no real notification that you are being shot. It reall is a shame considering how cool the games ideas are. Taking back a city from occupying DRNK forces block by block. With all these issues the multiplayer also has some great ideas, of outfitting a soldier and upgrading their gear and equipment how you see fit. With a backstory that acts like a perk, i can understand the direction. Again its poor execution, long load times, limited amounts of missions, and barely anyone to play with. Good try Deepsilver good try.
1070	0	a	  Meh. If I didn't have anything else to play, I'd say it's ok. But fortunately I do have other games. I don't really feel the atmosphere of occupation/resistance fighting, I'm not immersed, I don't like the design of the open world. Gunplay is not the best, stealth sucks and overall gameplay feels rather clunky and unpolished. Missions aren't overly creative nor fun. The characters aren't particularly engaging and the MC is completely mute, which sucks outside of Half-Life games. Oh, and it's sorta buggy, settings don't save at all (getting correct resolution, texture quality and so on took me good half an hour or more, and involved using some workarounds). Well, at least the visuals are nice, though I find everything about design tired, the uniforms, the vehicles, the drones, the metal outposts.  It's not an entirely bad game, just not a very good one either. Doesn't feel like an AAA title which it strives to be.
2725	1	a	Good but the real problem with it now is that there is not enough guns. Please add AK47 and more variants.
1071	0	a	I don't know what it is with this game, but between the aiming, interface, story, voice acting, and the lack of optimization I just couldn't enjoy this game. I played about 30 minutes and then sent in a refund request. I was hoping this would be something like the Metro series, but in a different universe; Sadly, it was just a script written by a bunch of high school interns.....................

2727	1	a	its a good game but the devs realy need to fix the issue where you do the police station liberation before it comes up in the storyline ( it makes it impossible to re rescue micky for the storyline )
1075	0	a	This quite possibly could be the worst game ever made, they should be ashamed to call this part of the homefront franchise
1076	0	a	One hour into the campaign and three hours into the multiplayer and I don't want to bother giving this game a better chance with what I've experienced so far. With a laughable open world, sub-par texturing, bad optimization, and animations that are like moving furniture; Homefront falls well below most anything Deep Silver had anything to do with.  I'm finding myself questioning why I've bothered giving the game a chance as much as I question the refund system that let my friend successfully refund this game, despite being as many hours into it as me, and myself not getting the refund.  Oh; and can we talk about what a laugh the multiplayer is? I understand Homefront is primarily a single player experience, but with how bad the multiplayer is; there was no point in even including it. It massively lacks any sort of content or progression. After the few hours I've played, I've already unlocked a majority of the weapons and a good chunk of any items to affect combat. The talent trees lack depth and the only real fun thing to pick up are cosmetic items; which can hardly hold a dry multiplayer scene with a couple maps down. If I wanted to collect cosmetic rewards all day, I'll at least do it in a more captivating and rewarding gaming experience like Overwatch.
1077	0	a	This game is full of glitches, i went pass one and now i encountered yet another one (Return the Heather) where the door is blocked off. Uninstalled this game and probably wont wanna replay the entire game again any time soon in the future.
2729	1	a	I don't really understand the hate about that game, I get 55~75 fps on ultra with a single gtx 980 and the game is not that glitchy, I really enjoy it for now.

2731	1	a	It was ok, not mind-blowing.
1081	0	a	  Can't figure out what the game is supposed to be...
1082	0	a	  Just flat out bad. Nothing here feels smooth, and is in every aspect outdone by FarCry3, which came out several years before this. Shooting is clunky with direct on headshots flat out failing to kill basic enemies.
1083	0	a	  Easily one of the worst games I've played, ever. And I've played Brink.   The AI are like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ children, (Running all the time, trying to run through a solid wall, talking needlessly all the time.) The game suffers from frequent frame drops, the guns feel weightless and have absolutely no character to them, the characters themselves are easily forgettable, not relatable, and serve no purpose other than to create a 'story' which you as the player most often feel un-attatched to.   Apart from the awful gameplay and awful characters, the setting itself is alright, the usage of cryengine really allows for beautiful lighting, and very atmospheric settings.  I rate this game a 3 out of 10, for beautiful environments, but absolutely horrendous gameplay.
2733	1	a	Performance is completely fixed and the game runs very well ! so yeah go get it :)
1086	0	a	  Instead of spending money on a unskippable intro cutscene, they should spend it on smoothing out the game. Terrible frames even on low settings with assets not appearing in the world make it a terrible experience. The game bugs does have some funny moments such as your character walking around with an invisible smartphone in a city with no environments even existing. Good thing free wekeends exist.
1087	0	a	  Shallow gameplay. Along the lines of FarCry's radio tower missions except there's one every 20ft. Each point is as simple as killing 1-2 guys, then pressing E on a radio. Even on the hardest mode, it's a walk in the park. Gunplay is basic at best. LMGs, Rifles, doesn't matter, they all respond the same; First bullet always fires straight. Should not be sniping with an LMG, but yet here we are.  Great environment, great concept, terrible storytelling, unengaging gameplay.  Note: Even after the promised patch, the game runs terribly. 780ti running everything on medium and still getting dips below 50fps. Don't even try and play it without VSync, it's just non-stop screen tearing.  If Homefront 1 was too linear, Homefront 2 is too open. Swing and a miss.
1088	0	a	Though it is better than the first it does not mean it is good. Playing the game for only 30mins I had already encountered several bugs and crashes ... not only that I dont want to sit and watch cutscenes for the entire time
2735	1	a	Played the game from start to finish on Deathwish difficulty during the free weekend. I'm glad I waited, because it's fantastic.  I know the game was off to a troubled start, and so I waited until the invetible free wekend after the latest (as of Sep 11, 2016) patch to try the game out.  Finally, after all these patches, the game is now complete. And it's pretty good.  The combat is rock solid - I love the feel of the weapons. Some of them aren't really viable, but they're fun to play around with anyways. The story seems to jump around a lot towards the end, but it was overall coherent and emotional. Not Oscar-level, but good enough to keep me interested.  You really do get the feeling of a desperate, scrappy urban combat. The difficulty ramps up nicely and I always felt challenged. Being able to recruit up to 4 resistance members to chum around with takes the game from good to great - the game is nearly impossible on the hardest difficulty without support and knowing when to just run.  Overall, I would say this game is as good as Far Cry 3 - maybe even better, since I prefer the urban combat.

Note: Even after the promised patch, the game runs terribly. 780ti running everything on medium and still getting dips below 50fps. Don't even try and play it without VSync, it's just non-stop screen tearing.  If Homefront 1 was too linear, Homefront 2 is too open. Swing and a miss.
2737	1	a	  Nice game
1093	0	a	Fun game but still crashes once in a while.
2739	1	a	Played the game from start to finish on Deathwish difficulty during the free weekend. I'm glad I waited, because it's fantastic.  I know the game was off to a troubled start, and so I waited until the invetible free wekend after the latest (as of Sep 11, 2016) patch to try the game out.  Finally, after all these patches, the game is now complete. And it's pretty good.  The combat is rock solid - I love the feel of the weapons. Some of them aren't really viable, but they're fun to play around with anyways. The story seems to jump around a lot towards the end, but it was overall coherent and emotional. Not Oscar-level, but good enough to keep me interested.  You really do get the feeling of a desperate, scrappy urban combat. The difficulty ramps up nicely and I always felt challenged. Being able to recruit up to 4 resistance members to chum around with takes the game from good to great - the game is nearly impossible on the hardest difficulty without support and knowing when to just run.  Overall, I would say this game is as good as Far Cry 3 - maybe even better, since I prefer the urban combat.
1102	0	a	I played this on the free weekend. Thought it was boring, I cannot recommend this to anyone at any price.  All the systems are in place for a FarCry-esque game but they just don't seeem to come together enough to make a compelling experience.
1103	0	a	this game is very fun for the first 5 hours or so but i got very bored once i got all the guns and everything in the first 5 hours the story is above average and is the only thing that makes me want to keep playing but i just can't go blind to the cons like the bad ai and the stupid amount of guns i didn't count but i think there are 6 or 7 maybe 8 i feel very sad that this game was a flop as i loved the first homefront and everything about it the nice amount of guns the pretty nice graphics the muiltiplayer which was kinda like battlefield with tanks and large maps and just all around fun and i wish home front the revolution had some kind of pvp aspect like i understand the resistance don't have a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ amount of tanks but that is what would of map it have more life if the norks had access to the drones and all the things in the game but they don't have the gear that the resistance has like the hacking device and all that good stuff and they also have the white armour for normal infantry so they would be easy to spot but they have better guns then the resistance so it would be a very fun mode of muiltiplayer if not that maybe like some kind of 5v5 or 10v10 modes where the norks half to find the resistance fighters in the crouds of people and they can control drones and scan people search people all while the resistance fighters are blowing up the APCs and doing what you do in the main game the game would then have alot more players and a longer life span i did buy this game before it was on free weekend and do not reccommend
1104	0	a	Can't change text language independently from spoken language even though it would be technically possbile. Devs don't react at all.
2741	1	a	Look in the dictionary for the word 'underrated' and you will see a picture of this game. Nothing more needs to be said.
2743	1	a	  Having a total blast with it, awesome game.
2745	1	a	  man this game so sh.it
2747	1	a	  Sens is slow, but when you feel it, gonna like;p Game is quite good, story 4/5, control 3/5, fun 5/5 :D
1107	0	a	  just played it i m just dissapointed  it has wasted potential  -Grapichs looks amazing but FPS drops Are real i7-4790 GTX 1080 Strix OC 16 GB Ram  -AI is just absolute garbage spawn points are are joke most of the time they spawn in the area where you cleared seconds ago frustratingly broken as ♥♥♥  -Open World is Ok but doesnt giveu the feeling of a open world its just paintjob...  The areas you have to liberate has 3-5 enemies u just kill em and press E on a valve or just blow up some tanks then press E on something else to liberate the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ thing no effort what so ever  Hell even when u do %100 Riot and broadcast a massage to whole city it shows a pre-made cinematic wherre some citizens scream and ♥♥♥♥ like wtf you cant even hear wtf u saying.  this game is just a paintjob of a horse with its grapichs but has the gameplay of a sht  it just doesnt justifty the money for me maybe grab it with %60 or %50 sale
1108	0	a	I just couldn't handle the gameplay, it's just clunky and bad. Like a bad version of the Far Cry gameplay.
2749	1	a	This was a surpise, I love it! Well worth the money, I am in my 3rd day of play 6 or 7 hours each day and I think I am about 1/3 the way through. There is a learning curve, so you will miss alot in the first 'block party'. But I see re-playablitiy with this game.
1110	0	a	So, I bought this game in hopes that not only would I be able to play what looked like a decent story mode, but to also play multiplayer games. Every time I went to join a random match it never finds anything, and when I choose to open a server nobody ever joins. This game is a huge dissapointment to me, a huge waste of $59.99... If I were you I would not waste the money to buy this stupid game and get something better like Battleborn or something.
1111	0	a	Game is boring and poorly optimized, and after 10 hours of single player compaign I lose my savegame for absolutely no reason at all.
2751	1	a	This was a surpise, I love it! Well worth the money, I am in my 3rd day of play 6 or 7 hours each day and I think I am about 1/3 the way through. There is a learning curve, so you will miss alot in the first 'block party'. But I see re-playablitiy with this game.
1114	0	a	Co-op matchmatking doesnt even function. Avoid at all costs.
1115	0	a	Pretty much a weak Far Cry copy.
2753	1	a	I really didnt care for the first homefront, but Having a blast playing HF2. Sure its not perfect and there are a few bugs, but nothing that crashed or stopped me from having fun with the game. I'm not bothered by the overzelous nature of the story line because this is an alternate reality. Yes there is alot to be desired, but homefront offers a freedom fighter open world that lets you recruit soliders, capture bases, customize guns and Fight for survival and gives you the excitment of planning out your attack.  I really hope the developer sticks to their word and keeps patching and expanding on the world of homefront in this style, because you can consider me a fan.  
2755	1	a	  Having a total blast with it, awesome game.
1118	0	a	My fault... i didn't trusted the reviews, on paper seemed a good game, no it isn't it suck bad,a lot. Leave it here. I really tried a lot of times to give it a chance. no no nonononono

2759	1	a	  After seeing all the hate this game has gotten i was reluctant to pay full price but after playing for the free weekend (about 22 hours) was pleasantly surprised.  Pros -  Looks gorgeous at max settings Long campaign compaired to most popular fps games Maps are a nice size good atmosphere Rich backstory The interchangeable weapon system is cool changing Attachments on the fly   Cons -  not enough story element imo not enough characted development weapon selection is kinda limited  AI is a little basic the stealth mechanics need a little work Not totally open world  Some good, some bad but all in all a very enjoyable game. Not nearly as bad as most are making it out to be. Though i suppose thats the curse of homefront the first game was hated on when it was relesed but i found it was a solid game and really enjoyed it same as with this instalment.
2761	1	a	Not bad.. a bit confusing at first but only played it for about 2 hours.
2763	1	a	I don't know what the complaining is all about. I do understand why the negetive reviews when it first came out but I started to play after all of the patches and it runs fine for me. I think that the people who are saying that their games are crashing after the updates aren't being honest with themselves or people about what their computers can handle or if it's even stable. I am running this on a 3-4 year old Alienware 18 laptop at medium settings at I have no issues at all. It's even locked in at 60 FPS and the game still looks amazing. I'm pretty sure that most people are trying to run the game at ultra when we all know that this has the cryengine and it's a very demanding engine.   As for the game review. I've only played 1 hour and 15 minutes so I don't know the storyline that well yet but I'm enjoying the open world aspect of it. I love games like this so it's my cup of tea but not for everybody. I think that people wanted a call of duty type of game when they bought into this game and was let down. I personaly believe that people have too high of expectations these days and do not remember back in the day when you got a glitchy game for $60 and it was like 5 hours long. The AI isn't that great on it but I am going to try a harder level to see what that's like.  One thing that annoys me is that I keep seeing reviews on people that are hating the game and not recommending it have 40+ hours soaked into the game. I don't know about you but I refuse to put that many hours into something I really hate. I also do not take bad reviews for people that have spent .2 hours on it as well. Not even sure if my 1.25 hours count but I just wanted to say that it's stable and like the game.   As for the price? I do think the $25 I spent on it is worth it and I also think that the developers are trying real hard to make the game great. Definately wait for the next sale.   There you go, my two cents worth. You can either hate it or like it but either way I'm going to keep playing this game because I enjoy it and do not care about people that whine about everything.
2765	1	a	This game surprisingly really good, I love customize my weapons. I play this game version apparently with less bug to compare to old version of this game. The negative side that I see is the enemy is sometime not very smart &amp; the story is rather dull. Other than that I really like this game, the game is like Far Cry 3/4 but in town.
2767	1	a	Nice game
2769	1	a	played 40mins on the free weekend so far. nice graphics, not too hard gameplay.  only shortcoming may be the fps, this games requires very good gpu. having 980m and putting most settings on high only with AA off still only yields 45-55ish fps. and some screen tearings here and there.
2771	1	a	.
2773	1	a	This game is nasty, the reviews are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Sometimes the AI gets stuck on corners, breaks immersion a bit, but this is still a nasty game.  Molon Labe.

2777	1	a	Free Weekend Review  I enjoyed it, the game runs almost at a constant 60fps on my computer. The world can be immersive if you give it the benifit of the doubt. (I was playing on the hard difficulty)  There are some drops in FPS, there are some minor bugs.  I am currently trying to fixed a bugged mission (finding schematics).  Honestly, this game is a 6.8/10 for me. I really like a lot of things about it, but it also has a lot of problems. I'll consider buying it later, but right now, I enjoyed my free trial.

2783	1	a	Its amazing how far this game has come since launch. Its also amazing how much of a shoddy mess this was when it launched. Luckily the latest pactch has finally fixed the major performance issues, and we are finally able to play the pretty decent Far Cry 3 clone that lies beneath.  If you loved Far Cry 3 but are sick of replaying it, I'd give this ago. Lighting looks amazing too, if you're into that sort of thing.
1134	0	a	  Farcry 4 with a Division skin.
2785	1	a	This game is nasty, the reviews are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Sometimes the AI gets stuck on corners, breaks immersion a bit, but this is still a nasty game.  Molon Labe.
2787	1	a	First of all. I dont see why people say this game is broken. I didnt stumble upon any bugs or glitches at all while i played.  Singplayer: Campaign is good in my opinion. Things to upgrade and modify. Was free for a weekend. I managed to complete the game throughout that weekend. Though at the cost of skipping alot of side mission stuff. Was mostly just interested in the story.  Throughout the campaign there is only 1 choice you have to make. I only did it once, so i only know one outcome. And you wanna check your phone. Not just for this choice. But in general too. Throughout the campaign is has the different peoples opinions and thoughs. Adds a good deal i think.  Multiplayer: Network errors. I dont think you can play online at all.   Overall. Good Game for singleplayer. Though i wont risk buying this game, cause the multiplayer doesnt seem to work at all. And because i allready completed singleplayer. So i have no more interest in the game.
1138	0	a	  Homefront: The Revolution is a game I've been interested in since it was originally announced. After playing the first game in the series in 2011, I was impressed by what I initially saw in the sequel. Although the game is a huge improvemant over the original game in terms of ideas, it's still not a good game. The main character's are sort of cookie cutter and not very well developed. The story is shallow, not well thought out, and in the end feels unimportant. The world design is boring and doesnt feel alive or real. The A.I. in this game is terrible. Strange scripting, like npc's hitting walls with melee weapons for no reason. The gameplay is 'ok' but feels outdated, the gunplay could have been a lot better. I really believe if this game came out 10 years ago (minus the modern graphics obviously) people really would have liked it. Sadly this game doesn't meet todays standards.  The optimization leaves a lot to be desired and I experienced frame drops/hitching/stuttering throughout my 10 hour playthrough of the game. This was on a 980 Ti mind you. I understand performance used to be worse before the latest update, but in my opionion it's nowhere near where it should be. I have seen worse though. Your experience may vary.  This game does have things I really liked. The graphics in some environmonts were great. The game also features a great gun customization resembling the one featured in the 'Crysis' series. There was some great character design throughout the game. I was very impressed by the way faces looked in this game as well. Besides the terrible animations, the characters looked real. The game does have a lot going for it, just not enough...  Overall I really think this game should have had A LOT more work. I know people don't like to hear this, but this game really should have been pushed back farther for optimization and gameplay improvements. I really feel this series and game have/had a lot of potential. This series and gamers deserve better.
2789	1	a	Like The Division.. maybe next time i will buy that game.
2791	1	a	I want to be brief and open. This game was not as good as I hoped it would be. I still recommend it if the idea excites you. I loved the first Homefront. This was not as good. I have not played it since the first month after it came out - it was glitchy, but fun. I had fun playing this game. That's what games are for.
2793	1	a	Okay, after i finish the Aftermath DLC i'll review it. I promise. But here's my rating.   8.5/10 ~I'll put this game in the Test of Time award nomination.
2795	1	a	Played abit, it isn't that bad. Although there are several lackness for texture, and weapons. Graphics itself is a mixed, the lighting is great but the texture can use improvement here especially the weapons texture. There are still some bugs, such as AI bugs. Overall, for a less than 1 year title and already dropped price, I can say it is fairly worth it. If you can get it on sale, it will be more worth.
2797	1	a	Honestly not that bad of a game. The story, gunplay, customization and freedom that this game has is very good. It reminds me of Far Cry 4. The only downside I can see is poor optimization and for some people driving ceratin vehicles. Also, now it is on sale and will most likely be on the Steam Holiday Sale so it is fairly cheap.
1139	0	a	This game lacks any direction to maintain my interest.
1140	0	a	the first one was far better.........
2799	1	a	This game got quite a lot of flak, but considering it took 4 years of development time by a new studio and with quite a few people...... It wasn't all THAT bad, for me at least.  In fact I actually liked it, the graphics were great, it ran smoothly, gun modifications were fabulous. I've always enjoyed the capturing stronghold element of games like far cry, so I was happy it was included here.  Yes the story felt predictable, and the hype around walker died down faster than a boner after watching a porno with an actual story... BUT that ending redeemed it for me.   I for one am looking forward to a sequel.
2801	1	a	  What the ♥♥♥♥ did you just ♥♥♥♥ing say about me, you little ♥♥♥♥♥?

2803	1	a	  From what ive played in the free weekend the game is good and it runs well. Most of the older reviews are from when the game crashed, ran poorly and just didnt work but it seems pretty stable now. Dont listen to the older reviews since they are irrelevant now
2805	1	a	Great Graphics, Great weapon customization, Great gameplay, Great Optimisation Bought it @ -75% sale. Worth the price. so underrated. Homefront 1 was lame though.

1144	0	a	I really wanted this game to work. Its issues are mainly the fact it is unplayable on older systems. My PC is from 2013 and it was nothing but a laggy judder mess. I had to stop playing once I got on a dirt bike. It worked more the teleportation on a VR game than a traditional game. I am super bummed about this too. I enjoyed the first game; I was really looking forward to it. Also the motion capture people’s movements are weird and break any kind of immersion.

2815	1	a	  Has it's issues? Yes. But seems that it was way worse than before and devs did hell of a job of fixing it. I'm running basically a 2012 high-end rig and have no problem running it at great details. Only thing that bothers me is basically the animations. I would say that even the price is reasonable comparing it some of every year 50$/€ piece of you know what games.  PS: Has a bit of a Dead Island spark to it (in the open world meaning).
2817	1	a	Some frustrating problems with AI and performance, but a huge world, great gunplay and a great story.
2819	1	a	Very Fun. Much improved over the original Homefront. Liked the weapon mod system. Enjoyed the game so much it pre-empted BF1 and Civ 6, even though it is not comparable. Did not try the multiplayer. It has an easy storyline, and less linear progression. I recommend this game.
2821	1	a	This is a hard review for me. On one hand, Always have been a homefront fan, Compelling story, Sense of urgency, and great graphics. Since being taken over by another dev, I DO believe this game is great. Thats why I would recommend it, however, take not of my cons CONS: Open World is clunky, and doesnt feel as open as you'd think Only 1 vehicle ? wtf Disconnected Storyline lined with random on the spot sidequests Limited Guns PROS: Great graphics Moderate Difficulty Somewhat smooth combat a HUGE improvement from the 5 hour long original Homefront 
1147	0	a	  Updated/removed original review  The concept of Homefront, the IP itself, is a great idea and it’s something fresh. I feel like everytime this name gets used it’s already tainted because the original game had issues during development but not to the same extent this game went through.  There are sooo many issues with the game I cannot simply go through them all, the game felt rushed and was simply an unfinished AAA title. This isn’t acceptable at all.  Even after being completely aware of the issues the game has, they even mislead the consumer in the 1.4 patch by saying and I quote…    “Save Stalls– We have optimized the number of checkpoint save locations throughout the single player campaign. This means that the short ‘pauses’ that the player encounters are reduced and the game will now inform you that it is saving.    How can you sit there and say that you fixed save stalls when the game stalls/stutters get worse the deeper into the campaign you get?  I do want to ask, it is great that you finished a project but why did you accept it as is? I cannot understand how this was accepted by Deep Silver as a final build or a finished product?  For a full review check out my video here.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQoTbiwiZ3E 
2823	1	a	First, the game isn't as buggy as people claim. It's a Cryengine game, all you need to do is not play it at max settings and suddenly the game works perfectly fine. Know the limitations of your own system.  Second, this is not a sequel to Homefront. It doesn't have any connection to it besides 'North Korea is the bad guy', and 'There's a tank called the Goliath'. If you're especting the crap from Homefront or some oddball story, don't. They're not related.   With that said, this is a good game, one of few games I recommend. Beyond the usual positives and negatives with the Cryengine, between it looking detailed and well designed, Homefront The Revolution has the good gameplay of Crysis 3 with the simple design of Farcry 3. If you liked the landscape of Crysis 3, or liked the open combat of Farcry 3 and 4, you'll like this game. Half the game is going from base to base capturing them, and running into the odd patrol, or having multiple ways of doing the same thing. The story is kinda eh, but so is the story of all open world games.  What really shines is the other half of the game, where you're in 'yellow zones', making it really feel like the world is believable. You can't just walk into a yellow zone, that is residental areas in the Philly turned Bagdad, and gun down everything in sight with no consequences. You open fire, suddenly you have 3 humvees on you and 50 guys on you. You kill a civilian, people react and get ♥♥♥♥♥♥. More than that, not every problem is solved with killing either. Some cases it's better and easier to distract soldiers away from whatever they might be harrassing than you flat kill them. While it's not a terribly deep game, it's more realistic than the majority of games you'll run into on the market, not just story wise, but gameplay wise.   It also has multiplayer, which I will say is good on it's own. They're effectively stand-alone missions with friends, with a progression/RPG system tacked on to give it more content. The amount of content is enough for me to say it's like a DLC expansion given to you by default; Extended missions, with a second character/mechanics system, with friends. That said, because of the bad rap the game's gotten, there's not a lot of people playing the multiplayer. It really does shine when you have other people obviously, but with some smart playing and decent skill you can play alone. Again, think of it as extra, standalone missions  All that said, it does have bugs. It's open world, it's bound to have bugs. Besides the usual Cryengine garbage, some geometry will trap you, NPCs might sink into the ground sporaticly, and enemies can spawn in impossible places. Beyond that, this is one of the least buggy open-world games I've played. Between FO4 and FC3/4, this game is very solid. Again, if you're having issues, turn down the settings, it's the Cryengine.   Oh, and if all that's not enough, you get a second free game added in, albeit and old game :P
2825	1	a	Steam is currently mixed about this game, and so am I. It has some great elements and some godawful elements to it, which balance it out to the point of... being mixed.  The guns and gear are very satisfying to use, but the UI can be infuriatinly unintuitive at times.  There are good maps, plenty to explore but after a while it starts to feel repetitive. Combined with a 'hearts and minds' mechanic in the game (where you have to win the hearts and minds of the citizens for the next stage of your revolution) which is also infuritatinly slow, this reached the point of boredom - note that there's a difference between patience and boredom, and this particular mechanic managed to stretch that patience.   I managed to force myself to slog through this but I had simply stopped caring, all the fun was sucked out.   From what I'm reading, this is a formula similar to the Far Cry series - so if you like that kind of mechanic you probably won't mind this. The good bit is that I have learned that I should be avoiding Far Cry!   The story is poor and at times feels extended for the sake of extending it. The characters involved are... morons... with no clear purpose or goal, who have no idea what they are doing. The ending was OK.   With all of this mixed it's really difficult to say. If you're looking for a story, stay away from this one. If you're looking for exploration and good gear, then have a look - but be prepared to understand what you're getting into.
2827	1	a	So far this game is pretty awesome! The game plays alot like an 'urban warfare' Farcry. The graphics are awesome, gun customization is amazing (so are the animations of it). So far I have no complaints, i'll update the review when i've beaten the game, but i'm happy with my purchase :D.   Ps. The game is getting alot of bad reviews, mostly seems to be because of optimization issues (or just people hating on new release games with the other cool kids). While the optimization could be much better, this game has incredible graphics and i'm running it fine at 4k. Hopefully Dambuster will keep the game updated and maybe add some cool stuff to it like the devs of dying light did. This game is pretty awesome already but with some love and care from the dev's could become a 9/10 or so. So, if you are having problems running the game, these issues should hopefully be fixed soon.   980ti i7 4790k at 4 GHZ 16 GB of ram Game installed on a 1tb SSD
2829	1	a	Freaking great! Playing Co-op tactfully, a pal and I snuck through enemy patrols and silent killed multiple KPA in the way. Then things went loud. Excellent fire fights. Shoot. Move. Communicate. Absolutely loving it! Camp and get overrun. You have to flank and coordinate during the combat. AI flanks. We were doing well hitting their right, then suddenly we are being hit from behind as more KPA enterd our building from a back alley. Bad ♥♥♥!
2831	1	a	I've had some time now in both the single and multiplayer game. First of all I have NO ISSUES with the graphics. I am using a 750TI (stop laughing) with the latest driver and even on medium am getting no slow down that I can see.   The single player game at first feels a little on rails and with that being the biggest complaint of the original game that was scary, but once you get out of the 'tutorial' it becomes much more open world and feels sorta similar to like the Gotham games and Assassins Creed in that you can run around the map doing a variety of activities and follow the story mission as you please.   The multiplayer is more similar to a game like Vermintide ... you start off in a lobby where you can customize your character and set your loadout etc .. but then you join missions in four man groups and run them. This was a tiny bit disappointing to me as I was hoping for a open world co-op campaign, but that said I loved Vermintide so I am also enjoying this. As you progress you earn money and XP to unlock skills and buy crates that have all kinds of things from guns to gear to customization opens in them.   Combat feels fine to me. The guns are responsive enough and I am especially enjoying both the shotgun and marksman rifle. The cover system works well enough and theres a good enough variety of norks to keep it interesting and force you to think through encounters.   Overall this was a game I was waiting for and so far I dont feel let down by it. Or at least not enough that I would recommend against its purchase. In fact I am trying to drag my friends who I played Vermintide in with me. :3
1151	0	a	To anyone who loves a true single driven story mode game, this game is honestly not for you. The beginning of the game fools you at first with its nice intro but then completely loses its edge when it goes upon your first mission and goes down hill from there... if you want a game that is a clone of 'the division' go on.... keep playing or buy this game...if you want something more fun...look someplace else and save 60.$ of your hard earned money.
2833	1	a	  Homefront: The Revolution is a decent open world shooter with an interesting setting, nice graphics, good gameplay &amp; gun-handling and problems in performance (micro-stutters). It is certainly not a Far Cry or Call of Duty, but has still to offer certain new and interesting ideas to the genre
1154	0	a	My computer system exceeds the recommended requirements (albeit not by much, but still) and the first thing I see when we transition to actual, proper gameplay is a clunky as all ♥♥♥♥ framerate that literally gave me a headache. I couldn't finish the opening bit because of this.  Once this is patched and the game runs at over 15 FPS, I will amend my review to reflect it.
2835	1	a	I liked it but get it on sale if youre not 90% sure on buying it now 8/10  -needs some polishing (optimization, bugs and glitches, ect.) -would buy Doom before buying this -devs did well for such a small team and the hardships they dealt with -the devs seemed like they overloaded themselves a little when making the game but they executed well and tried their hardest to make this game a success and i believe that that deserves the most praise by far here
2837	1	a	From what i've played of the game so far it seems to be pretty decent, It's not gonna win any game of the year awards, but the world is gorgeous and very atmospheric. The gunplay is borderline exceptional IMO. There are a few glitches,but nothing ground breaking. I'm playing on the hardest difficulty and it seems this is how the game was meant to be played. It's not SUPER hard,but instead makes the AI pretty competent for the most part. The story is what you should be buying the game for. If youre a fan of single player story campaigns give this game a shot. I would probably give it like...UMMM 6.7/10 something like that. its worth buying,but once you finish the story your unlikely to play the game again.
1155	0	a	30 minutes in the main 'character' gets strapped to (another) chair and almost tortured by one of his fellow resistance fighters because he is immediately mistaken to be a spy.   What is his response to this?   Absolutely nothing. Because he's a silent protagonist who was going to sit there and have his nipples cut off by some chick who he is allied with. Oh, but lucky for him the leader waltzed in and checked for his ID just in time to save those precious nips.    Other than that, a 980Ti handled the game on MAX 1080p like garbage (stuttering/constant drops in FPS at 60Hz) while just running around the starting area. I have no hope for combat running smoothly.
1156	0	a	I personaly found the game beautiful but slow and boring...
2839	1	a	Pay attention if you ARE THINKING to buy this game or not, so many people were crying about the optimization of the game, i can clearly tell you that they are playing it with PC's older than their grandparents's parents the optimization is perfect playing with 70 fps, sometimes drops to 55-60 but only for few seconds. So that's it for the optimization. The vehicle physics are cool, the feature that you can upgrade your weapons and attach everything on it. Also if you don't know the multiplayer experience is awesome, and it's fun with friends. So please don't look at the fake negative reviews and buy this, it's worth the money.
1158	0	a	This game worths the price,for it taught me a valuable lesson:DO NOT PRE-ORDER ANY GAME WITH OVERWHELMING NEGATIVE REVIEWS!(especially ones come out of small studios like this)
2841	1	a	I am having a lot of fun with this game - I don't think there's any point considering it alongside DOOM, as they're both entirely different propositions.   The open-world is great, full of loot and the gameplay features plenty of weapon and gear upgrades to chase. The weapons themselves have been fun, and the on-the-fly modding is fun. It's possible to recruit several AI followers to help you with quests, and you have to think a little bit before attempting to tackle them - it's not always possible to run in guns blazing. There's verticality in the environment that you have to use, and more than one kind of stealth that is necessary.  My main complaints would be that the enemies are capable of killing you within a few shots, which has led to a few frustrating moments where I've been sent back to square one. It's not always clear which way is the best to tackle missions and quests, but having said that, I'm still playing.   I think this is a way better game than what the reviews have been saying. I haven't had any performance problems, though, which would probably change my opinion of the game if I did have them.
2843	1	a	There isn't an inbetween yes and no as this game is in the Middle. It's not BAD, it's not GOOD either, it's an ok game. My advise is to wait until it's patched and optimized.    Good points; Gameplay Weapons Hours of gameplay Back story via collectables RC cars ;)   Bad points: Runs slow on a pc with 16GB of ram and a 8GB graphics card... HOW!!  Cheesy acting ONLY two levels of a hidden game which I won't spoil for people unaware there is a classic game hidden in the game ;) NO multi-player, only co-op Spawning behind you insta-kill shotgun b*****ds!   7/10
2845	1	a	Just a quickie on the single player  Like far cry but with a subjectively more interesting setting and motivation offset by poor performance that greatly impacts the flow of gameplay (specifically the shooting). Be ready to run it low in order to preserve framerate (becomes a much better experience) and make the shooting feel a lot better.   Play it for... - the world - the environmental storytelling - the yellow zones  - the general feeling of being a member of an outnumbered and out gunned resistance - chunky guns   be aware of... - ♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI  - Poor optimisation  - Shallow characters - debatable motorbike handling  - a general lack of polish   If you like to get lost in a world, don't mind making your own fun/ narrative within the loose story and have the hardware to ignore poor optimisation or make it passable then you will probably love the gameplay and feel of it. Ignore the story
2847	1	a	First of all I have only played this game for an hour. But so far my expierence has been a positive one. It has really engaging gameplay and great graphics. I read some reviews where they say it is optimized badly. I have a GTX 965m and it runs great. I also really like the gurrila tatics not many games have it where once you attack you have to run away, so I like it. 8/10
2849	1	a	Homefront.... What can I say... I'v played about 10 hours the game has its in's and outs needless to say the game isn't at polished as one can hope for but its not a flaming bag of ♥♥♥♥ either, with the potential to at least appeal for a single player game. That being said Co-Op is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t sale its mission based survial at best. The single player aspect I'd Say B+ at best.  All in all I give this game a 6/10 decent enough to play threw once, but wouldnt go back for more.
2851	1	a	I am LOVING this game... the weapons feel authentic and visceral. The graphics are phenominal and the gameplay sucks you in and makes you feel part of the world.  The combat feels like organized chaos which is exactly how urban combat should feel, There are many times you will be slowly walking through a warehouse listening for your enemies while they are listening for you and then you see eachother at the same time and fast bloody firefight insues. The AI is also interesting and surpised me several times with their actions, for example there was once where I am on the street about to enter a building when an enemy soldier starts screaming at me in Korean from behind, he did not instantly shoot me... I froze and stood there for a moment while he is yelling at me with his gun up, I then quickily dart to the right into the building and right when I do so he opens fire and bullets spray the doorway I was in just moments ago.  As far as some peoples complaints about it not running well... it has Crysis 3 level of detail and graphics only in a a large open world... It is going to bring your 970 to its knees not because it is poorly built but because it is built so well... I have two 980 TIs SLI'd and ran it with everything on high in 2k with a steady 70 FPS. Just for arguments sake I turned it from 2k to 1920x1080 which is what most people are running it at and cranked everything up to very high and ran at a steady 90 FPS... I then turned it back to 2k and down to high as it looks amazing this way and runs fine. If your computer can't run it fully cranked that is fine as the game still looks amazing on high rather then very high just turn some graphics options down... So stop giving the game bad reviews just because your computer is not powerful enough to run it please.
2853	1	a	Being a person who really enjoyed the first game, I bought Homefront: The Revolution, and finished it through. It certainly is different than the first, but not necessarily in a terrible way. I don't think it is as good, but definitely does have great elements of it's own. Here is what I found:   PROS: -You are not too powerful, the KPA can take you down easily if you are not careful (when faced with a part of town completely occupied by KPA, you must sabotage KPA tech and save citizens. After you've proved that the citizens can take back whats been taken, more will join the resistance) - Graphics are amazing, this is probably one of the largest factors that really add play value  - It is very exciting when you get into conflict. The mechanics work very well when fighting, again being a large factor in play value. Plus, when any freedom fighters are near you, they'll help you. - Customization is unique and flexible - Ideas for the visuals are real atmospheric  - You can ride motorbikes! - America!    CONS: -Glitchy Textures - Spawning is pretty bad (units will pop up and disappear out of nowhere) - Voice animations very unstable - Story is not so strong (you can't really 'feel' the characters) - Weapons look bulky/oversized in the hands of the Ai - Optimization is tricky for many people's computers apparently, but if you figure out the right settings, it'll run just fine - Dramatically different from the first game(the first was awesome)  - Not worth the full price, if you are looking forward to it, buy it on sale    'Home Is Where The War Is'
1164	0	a	there is so many things to mention the game is so unpolished, and the devs lazy.
2855	1	a	This Game... where do I start.   Ok. First I can defintley say that doom is down right better than this. BUT, its not to say that this game is bad. It has many issues with optimization and lip syncing. But those as of now is pretty meaningless to me. Hear me out. The story is pretty lacking to say the least. but with enough beer its pretty fun. The gunplay is a bit choppy prob due to the random frame drops (its not my pc, 4770 and 2 Titans in SLI, 1440p 144hz, ussually 60-50 fps, but will drop to 20 sometimes). The gameplay is almost like far cry 3,4 (more like 3 but aspects of 4 is there) and is pretty fun for a run and gun kind of guy. the stealth is down right horrible with the frame drops, and the ai to be trolly at times, is just painful. The customization is awesome, it was the best thing in crysis if you ask me. And the Soundtrack is not that bad, the composer shoud get a raise.  All in all it has its problems, but if this game is ever on sale for $30 maybe $40, its a good pick up.  7/10
2857	1	a	Good Game, lots of fun and addicting. I honestly don't know why it is getting such bad reviews from so many people, I think it is outstanding and worth the money.
1165	0	a	I REALLY want to recommend this game, but this game does not want me to recommend it to you. This game has a bad case of Duke Nukem Forever, it is obvious that this was not a completed product but since it was move from one developer to another they felt the pressure to just get the game out on market.   I was looking forward to this game quite a bit, and it did not fail completely out of my personal return policy requirements, but I can not recommend it to other people in all fairness. If they can fix their broken crap I would happily change this review into a positive.   Right now though wait to buy this game. If they fix it great pick it up, if not you will save your money on a 85% finished product.   Full once over here  https://youtu.be/Ho936khEaaw 
1166	0	a	  Absolutely horrendous. And to think, I was really looking forward to this title. Oh well... back to Doom :)
2859	1	a	First off I will say that yes, there are some buggy issues with the game right now, but if you enjoy feeling like a stealthy bad-♥♥♥ in anyway, this game is probably for you. Gameplay feels great and is pretty easy to immerse youself into the game. I am looking forward to the next couple patches to really solidify a fun resistance expereince.
2861	1	a	I don't understand all the negative reviews, the game is awesome. If you like games like FarCry, Crysis or Dying light you will like this game.  I read about issues with frame rate droping, I have expirence just one when I was picking a side mission from a board. My buid is an FX 9370 with a R9 280x.
2863	1	a	There is a crossbow, that you can turn into a flamethrower.  11/flamethrower  In all seriousness, I've been waiting 5 years for a sequel to Homefront, and this game is not it. What made the first one such a great gem? Fast paced movie like singleplayer with a great story, amazing geared koreans who look badass AF and best of all an AMAZING multiplayer experience that is a perfect balance between CoD and BF yet creative and original. Where did HF:the revolution go wrong? The multiplayer, where is the godamn multiplayer? where are the unlocks, the vehicles, the kickass weapons like the PWS diablo and the T3AK?  The singleplayer is fine as far I have played and the koreans have amazing gear, but where is the iconic PWS diablo?  After all this game has been trough(RIP thq) I think it deserves a reccommendation, but only because the singleplayer is far better then the last Battlefields and CoD campaigns.  I think they can fix the game by adding big multiplayer maps like the first one, add the same killstreak system, vehicles, unlocks, more guns, drones all the crazy ♥♥♥♥ that made the first game so enjoyable.  You guys literally took the weakness of the first game and made it your strongest, make a singleplayer that last longer then 5 hours, but you forgot the rest of it that made such a good game.  my real score: 7.5/flamethrower crossbows.
2865	1	a	Lack of technical polish (a beta release?) and cheesy main characters (and voice acting in places) let down some strong world building design and inventive gameplay - difficult to recommend at full price (£40!) but definitely one to look at in the sales....
2867	1	a	I noticed a lot of negative reviews on here... Still purchased. I have a custom system I built of 2x 980 Ti Hybrids in SLI that are OC and a 4790k on water but stock @ 4 GHz. I'm running 1080p @ 144Hz and I have 32GB RAM. I'm running Nvidia driver version 365.19. I should also mention that my rig has been a labor of love that's been a rollout upgrade since 2014.  Turn off super-sampling and the stupid motion blur so you can play and drink without vomiting and I've had no issues. I ran into several issues with super-sampling and motion blur on but once that was kicked, the game is VERY enjoyable even though it needs to be tweaked. I can't honestly give this a bad review after seeing the graphics and the gameplay. Yes, there are some shortcuts taken that are obvious. However, this team spent a lot of time on this game and to me it shows. I've been able to play this maxed out (minus motion blur and super-sampling) on my 1080p @ 144Hz monitor no problem and even though the voice acting is bad according to some reviews, (BARF who cares) I like the game so far. Once into the game, it strikes me very much like Farcry 4 where you conquer territories (Philly) and upgrade weapons with the option of advancing the main mission at your leasure. I forgot to mention that the Korean voice actors seem spot on!   I'm honestly not trying to come off like a ♥♥♥♥ when I say I have had no issues and I enjoy the game. I've been told that my specs make everything awesome but I assure you that is not the case on custom builds by people like me who know just enough to be dangerous to risk losing lots of money if I failed at the build. Been there, done that. Sometimes different manufacturers products hate eachother and you realize you made a bad decision...  Anyway, I am the honest and dissenting voice it seems and I like this game so far and at this point I would purchase it again. I have had no crashes, no graphics issues other than mentioned, and I love the game so far.  EDIT: Finished the game!! Noticed TONS of FPS issues in late game to the point where the game was not playable at ALL even on my high-end system. I closed the game enitrely and restarted but that didnt help. Only a complete reboot of my rig would allow me to continue at playable FPS. I suspect game data remains in the GRAM and RAM unless a reboot is performed or real-time data is poor and bogs down the system. I still recommend the game but wow did they waste all of that effort with extremely poor optimization. What a kick in the nuts to those hard workers... It's like building a skyscraper on a Jello foundation. Why? Just why? I also find it hard to believe that an employee did not bring up these CRUSHING PROFIT PERFORMANCE ISSUES before release. I know these issues were brought up at BETA from players but for some reason the decision was made to press on and ignore. Seriously, think of the money and accolaids that could have been had if you released a quality product instead of releasing pig vomit performance and play catch-up as you go... Also, a free upgrade of digital crap does not satisfy anybody if you CAN'T PLAY THE ♥♥♥♥ING GAME!!
1174	0	a	Initially, the game wasn't too bad. The hearts &amp; minds quests ruined this game for me.
2869	1	a	Pro's- I was really grabbed in the beginning by the story about a revolution, it has very good characters and the voice actors really make the characters feel real! No repetitive main missions, every new main mission is a new experience. I never got bored with the main missions. Great animations including finishers, reloading guns, and interactions with other NPCs. Not a COD cliche story and action like the first Homefront. Has over 30 hours of main story gameplay.  Con's- Graphics can be better because they are working with the Cryengine. The permocrence needs a lot of work I have a AMD FX 8350 and a GTX 970 and I can't play above low so wait for performance patches. There are MANY glitches and the AI is really bad very easy compat on easy I would recommend going Normal or Hard difficulty. The multiplayer is a full rip of any other ♥♥♥♥ing shooter barely no guns, repetitive team deathmatch, choosing classes doesnt matter its who ever pulls the trigger first and bad connection issues.  6/10 It's ok
2871	1	a	Alot of people were saying that this game was bad and not worth it. Personally no Homefront will beat the first one but this one was good i enjoyed the story line and all the new gadgets/upgrading trechniques, To me the best part about this game is the ability to customize your guns , buy diffrent type of nades,stuns ect. RECOMMEND IT
2873	1	a	its an okay game. nothing life changing, but its better than the first. i do kinda wish there was more weapons and equipment to upgrade and stuff, but who knows maybe there will be good dlc for that.
2875	1	a	Gameplay is good, same as Far Cry or Dying Light  but it is very disappointing when finished, you can't roaming of the city....
2877	1	a	Short version, it's a solid game that is fun to play, has mediocre at best voice acting, a semblence of a plot and a few graphical glitches. While fun to play it feels like it needed another month or so of play-testing before release.  (For reference, I'm running an i5 3770k with two 660Ti in SLI, on lowest settings it was perfectly playable, anything higher gave input lag of up to .5 seconds. FPS was constant except for ~.5 second freezes when saving, which were never at bad times.)  Long Version:  Pros; -Fun map to explore -Beautiful environments -The weapon customization system gives you options, and due to the time it takes to change the weapons it asks the player to think about the combat situation before entering it -Dodging between buildings in a 'red' zone while avoiding Nork patrols and the Airships (robot sky whales, no, really) is very fun -Moving through an occupied 'yellow' zone while dodging patrols and cameras is also fun -Seeing the 'effect' that the player character has on the environment is nice. It goes from dodging patrols and hiding to walking down the middle of the road over the course of liberating a zone.   Cons: -Very mediocre voice acting -Unoriginal/predictable characters and plot -Rare minor graphics glitches (a few people floating 1-2ft off the ground, etc) -Variable AI, sometimes dumb sometimes ok. The flying drone AIs were very poor and would sometimes try to fly into a building and get stuck or run into walls and explode, but to be fair I've worked with real life drone autopilots and our real world ones aren't much better. -The motorbike is super glitchy and not very useful in the environment. I found several bikes embedded in objects and died twice just getting off the bike.  Overall: I liked the game. The story and characters were meh but the fun of running through the city and liberating the zones was why I got it, and for me it was worth it. The glitches were never game breaking and easy for me, at least, to overlook. I'm ok with the $60 price tag since I got much more play time from this than a call of duty title (I mostly do single player stuff), but it's up to you if you want to wait for a sale or not.
1181	0	a	Have you have ever wanted a game to be good but no matter how much you look at the positives of it, the negatives of it outway the positives?   yes?  Well this is homefront for me apart from the fact i cant find ANY positives to say about it only negatives. Just save the money and get something else..... either that gift it to your worst enemy and watch them die of boredom.
1182	0	a	13/09/2016 got a lot more bug -- sadly
1183	0	a	nice looking game but gameplay is terrible and boring
1184	0	a	Tried it free, now understand why it has an under 40% rating. If they were looking to gain customers with a free weekend, considering thier overall rating droped 5%, i'd say that backfired lol. Probably saved allot of people money and regret though.....
2879	1	a	when you look down you can see your legs
2881	1	a	Actually pretty fun.
2883	1	a	This game is getting a lot of greif, simply because most computers seem to not be up to the task graphically to support this game. The game was a 35GB download, so you knew it was gonna be massive and that it was going to be graphically demanding. Besides a few FPS shuttering here and there, the game is great. That being said, I feel like this is a MAJOR improvement over the original Homefront, but there is still some room for development. The story could have been better developed and the map could have been a bit larger.   Otherwise, this is a solid game!
2885	1	a	britty good
1188	0	a	I bought this game because I liked the other homefront and I thought the trailers looked pretty cool. I downloaded the game and started playing, everything was fine until I beat the tutorial and actually started combat, Aiming feels akward, almost like your mouse is lagging and when you actually fire your weapon the recoil is very hard to manage, I'm not sure if this is intentional or not but either way it makes the experience suffer. Another thing that was unsatifactory was driving, I couldn't make any turns without crashing into walls and there was absolutley no way I could go up ramps (It was like driving a car in Hatred). Considering that those two things are major mechanics of the game it threw off the entire experince and I ended up refunding the game. However I will say that it had a few good parts; the graphics looked very nice (Although I feel like the devs put more time into them than the actual game mechanics) and the hacking bit that you could do with your phone was pretty cool too. Overall I'm extremely dissapointed
2887	1	a	britty good
2889	1	a	Don't know why this game has so many bad reviews, its not getting the credit it derserves. Probably people crying about the Online mode not being pvp.  Compared to the first homefront game, it has completely changed. With it being open world and all.  Pros  Decent Graphics Open world I found the story quite good The gameplay is unique with cryengine, feels alot more realistic than all the Call of Dutys i have played. The gun upgrades i liked quite alot Gun Customization is really unique   Cons  Limited Guns Can feel reptitive at times After a few hours of play a day you can get bored. The game can be abit annoying at times   Overall its a decent fps, with a good story, with an open world. You can tell the guys that made this game put alot of work into it, and i believe its better then any Call of duty story you will play, but the Online multiplayer is cooperation, its not so good, which i feel that its a bit of a let down, would of been good if they adopted the PVP from the first Homefront game.  I would recommend buying the game as it can be a lot of fun most times, and if you looking for a FPS to kill alot of hours and liked Homefront 1, you most probably won't be dissapointed.   I wouldn't listen to guys reviews if they havn't even gave the game a chance with like 2-4 hours of play.  
2891	1	a	I honestly believe this game is really good! I do not know why people are complaining about it having a lot of bugs, frame rate issues, brain dead AI, and bad story. Well...... some of that is true but Dambuster Studio have indeed manage to fix some of these issues as they promised. My only problem with the game right now is that the story could have been better, (a little bit cheesy), The AI does need some fixing, and for some reason there are times when i start the game and when i get into the optimization is ok, but sometimes when I start the game again the performance it awful. Cannot tell if this is a bug or its just me  overall I do recommend this game, but be aware its not for everyone.
1189	0	a	Lots of fun, THE CONCEPT I ALWAYS WANTED. BUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUGSSSS!!!! More bugs than Rico can gun down. If you like the San Andreas Gang Territory style gameplay. THIS IS FOR YOU! Hopefully they can get reinforcements on the insect crushing though. Then it will be worth the amount of money I paid.
2893	1	a	HTR is an awesome game, the story was exellent however I would have liked a character customization to make me feel like I was part of the game, seeing how we didn't get to see Ethan Brady's face through the entire game. The weapon customization is sweet but some of the attachments would have been used for more of weapons. The sound of the game was not okay, it seemed that the sound was taken from videos of weapons. The weapons didn't sound right, the gameplay sound was awful and backround sound was plain assault to the ears. The cut-sense was average, not 2016 graphics but more like 2013 graphics.  Resistance Mode is a dissapontment, you can customize a character but you are given little to work with and items are unlocked through game play. You play on maps with other players trying to complete the task. If one of your team is down, you can revive them but if every player is down then its game over and you have to restart the mission. Players can even drop-in or drop-out of the game.   The game is good to where you will keep playing it to the very end so i'd give this game a 6/10 score and would recommend gamers picking this game up.
2895	1	a	First off this game is not as terrible as everyone makes out. If you can look past the terrible story line and the poor graphics optimisation the game is fun, the open world combat is good, and weapon customisation is nice. I wish there was more weapons though. It can be challenging at times which is good because most shooters these days such as BF4 and COD are just not challenging enough. Being able to recruit soldiers to fight with you is good aswell.  I don't recommend paying full price for this game as there are better games out at the moment for the same price. This game in my opinion is much better than Rainbow Six Siege and The Division which were huge disaspointments for me.
2897	1	a	Though Not the best game, this game is definately worth a try if it's on sale. Its story is pretty good, gameplay though rough, is good. The Gun customization is pretty cool, The AI is Horrible but that's just my opinion. Overall I'd Give it a  6-7/10 and definately a recommendation if you like story games and if it's on sale
2899	1	a	I don't know how to say but kinda fun though so yeah that's all i say.
2901	1	a	Decent game, worth picking up in a sale.
2903	1	a	Good game but with some real game faults !!!  - FPS´s in the game are a real mess, with average from 15fps on a real confrontation battle and 70fps on quiet places  (running on Asus GTX 980Ti 6GDDR5, I7 3770K 4.1GHz, 16GB DDR3). - Can´t customize all weapons (ex: I cant´put silencer on M4 or Shotgun).  - Enemy respawn is at your sight (they just appear on front of you).
2905	1	a	Mostly negative Really??   I know you're entitled to your opinion but come on mostly negative for this?  This game is amazing. I'm loving everything about it!!   The story is great, the gameplay is great, the weapons are great, the performance is great, the AI could be a little bit smarter but still this is a great game!  I have not witnessed any flaws I don't what the hell people are talking about bugs, I have not encountered any.   Btw I purchased this game full price and I would not complain about anything. Its worth every bit!
1210	0	a	Waste of time. I've never played a video game where I couldn't wait for it to end. First one was bad, figured new developer on the second one so I'd give them a chance. Nope. Feelsbadman.
1211	0	a	Man, I cannot think of a single good thing about this game.  Online nobody there  playing a mission and i cannot destroy the truck as i have no grenades, i try to leave to get some recruits and it says leaving mission are then forces me to start in the mission again, back to square one,  utter crap!
1212	0	a	Pretty mediocre shooter. I had hoped to see something different from the annual CoD iteration but they pretty much wasted the theme - liberating areas is way too easy (interact with the objective to make hostiles vanish instantly), and once you have liberated a zone you get plenty of allied redshirts, an infinite supply of rockets and will never be bothered by the KPA again. To be fair, the campaign is no worse than the annual CoD - less flashy explosions, but a slightly more original theme but then again you probably wouldn't buy CoD for the singleplayer.  Multiplayer is dead, which is just as well because it's just a generic cheap 'farm missions for cash to buy loot crates' Skinner box.   I didn't encounter any massive bugs other than the fact that the photographic quest didn't progress (blindly stabbing the target did work, but frankly that entire mission should have been scrapped given how utterly inadequate controls are - e.g. you cannot stand up while holding the phone, so designing a mission around holding the phone is utterly stupid).  Performance wise, FPS seemed to hover around 50 (with a few drops, including one brief case of FPS dropping 5 for no apparent reason in the prison area) in a R390, i7-6700k, 16GB VM i.e. it runs a lot worse than better looking games like Fallout 4.
2907	1	a	Ran into a glitch at one of the beginning missions. But was fixed with a reload. All the performance issues that all the neg reviews are citing are gone. Game is still kinda 'meh' but it runs quite well now.
1215	0	a	Good game... but AI of the bots is really stupid and game missions are chaotic, small weapon variation and no character leveling and skills. And where is blood and cruelty ?? Will buy for price &lt; 20$
2909	1	a	Game is really glitchy. Needs a patch asap.
1219	0	a	The game wont work it is stuck on the main menu but no play button and every time i go somewhere when i press okay it takes me to a asian guy that allows me to costumize him but there are no options
1220	0	a	  no just why
1221	0	a	Good game... but AI of the bots is really stupid and game missions are chaotic, small weapon variation and no character leveling and skills. And where is blood and cruelty ?? Will buy for price &lt; 20$
1222	0	a	ITS BAGGED, AFTER FIRST CITY, ITS NOT LOADING
1223	0	a	  I got to play around 2h on a free weekend, and I kinda liked what I got to play. It started out very... 'cinematic' - as in: holding your hand. After about 30min it starts to open up and you get a playground to do smaller missions in and a main quest line to finish. I thought they captured the us vs them feeling pretty good.  Unfortunately, after about 1h I got severe performance problems. I started to rubber-band across the level (like playing with a bad Internet connection), so movement got all skippy. After 2h it started to crash each time it tried to load a save game. So don't buy this on a whim, but really try it out after buying it, to make sure it runs well for you.
1224	0	a	Just try this game for free in week end ,   good  -- good graphic compare to CS:go,pay day2 ,  custom weapon , skill tree, weather , Light effect,   The story as relistic to news Coree du Nord VS United state of America homeland Security agency   part of Cybercommand / War dept and intellgence commite     The hacking system isn't relistic compare to watch dog   The Coree du Nord propanganda Voice is from real DPRK political TV channel , not from South Korea  K-POP      Worst  -- worst optz to Nvidia and AMD graphic card only get 25 FPS in high - ultra setting  the co-op have cheater unlimited armo and unlited RPG , health etc ,   The co-op easy to bug , get inside of the wall  not much Gamer in mutiplayer   Finally , This game should have mutiplayer 32 vs 32 likes Battlefield one and 50% as standard price 
2911	1	a	think u are a north korean, and fight for your independence against us or its some corporation， that would be more reality, and that's the game, that's the revolution.
2913	1	a	Game is really glitchy. Needs a patch asap.
2915	1	a	Standalone + Voice of Freedom Reveiw  This by far is one of the best games I have played for a while and i enjoyed every second of it. First play through on this game i put 27hrs into it unlike most 6-8hr linear games out there.  This game delivers you in stunning graphics great combat open world story experiance with  Endless ways to approach your objective switching up your weapon style on the fly using  The primary guns frame and attaching other mods changing the gun style completely.   After a while it may seem repeataive but this game keeps it fresh with new areas missions feels like your fighting for something.  This game is a big improvement from the first game and it stands alone you can not compare it to other games.  This game deserves to be a Triple A tilte and a spot in your library and  I give it 9/10 with my seal of approval.  -The voice of freedom dlc reveiw, 9gb download with a 30 minute campaign really! 9 gb I would expect 8-9hrs this is the shortest dlc i have ever played. i love this game but not this dlc, It should of been heaps longer like getting recruits as you progress through the campaign leading upto the events of standard game (more story driven). But not this I don't understand this dlc i give it a 1/10 very dissapointed.
2917	1	a	I had a lot of fun playing this game, never issued any bug. What else do you need from a game exepte having a lot of fun?
2919	1	a	well homefront first was better than this in case of different graphics sites, i mean there we used to see the land with grass different sites here only building and structures pff, still gameplay and shooting was awesom, no bugs i found in game idk why peoples complaning about bugs, i didnt face any in entire game,  must play game,  best part i like about this game is shooting , guns custumizations..
1228	0	a	This game is messed up.
1229	0	a	low fps
2921	1	a	I want to play Co-Op Please Add Friend to Join with me
1239	0	a	  Nice graphics, that's about it for this game.   To much problems with framerate at first, then when i now try it after som patches it still have the problem where the game freezes for some seconds every minute.   I should not have problems since i got a 980 TI with 6 GB ram, there should be no problem with my setup.
1240	0	a	  I played the story for about 50 min. It took about 15 before they turn control over to you to do some fetch quests and then another 5 min of story before you even get a gun to shoot it. I woudn't recommend this game on its own merit. If you're a fan of the Far Cry series then there may be something here for you but if you were looking for a deep level of immersion maybe look elsewhere. 6/10
1241	0	a	waste of money and time :)
2923	1	a	*In my library it says I have 10 hours(which is correct) but on here it says i have 5 hours*  After playing this game longer than mostly everyone who has left a review, and I have only played for 10 hours, I have to say this is a pretty good game. People complaining about poor optimization and what not must have a pretty bad computer as i am able to keep my fps at or around 60 with an i7 and gtx 970. But, from what I have played so far, everything in the game is great and enjoyable in my opinon. The story is good, combat is great and the performance of the game is fine. So overall I would say that this game is great and worth it. Well, not $60 worth it but maybe $40 worth it.
2925	1	a	I think this game is fun for the average gamer. I'm an average gamer that plays lots of games that I think are interesting. This one, while the setting is dumb, is relatively fun. It isn't the most optimized game, I get random major frame drops right after a section is loaded up. But it only lasts a couple second. there are some bugs and glitches, but nothing that is game breaking. Personally I think this game is fun, if you find it interesting. Look up some gameplay first, then decide if you want to buy it.
2927	1	a	I have to say, rocky start for an actually fun game.   I give it a 7.5 out of 10  Enviroment is engaging and graphics are pretty damn nice. Their is some performance issues and im sure some patches to come will help on this. I like the mix of Dying light Parkour/Crafting Mechanics and the Openworld and the FPS style of guns and different types and mods for them. Not to mention gear for yourself so all in all a very customizable item game. The story I find interesting and the drive to free America from the Rule of the KPA is pretty out there idea but fun to toy with.  Im glad I picked this title up myself.
2929	1	a	Good game. Granted the plot line isn't all that and there are a fairly limiyed number a guns, but there are a ton of side missions to play through. If you want a PLOT RICH revolution game, DON'T get it. If you just wants to shoot some Norht Koreans and blow stuff up, DEFINITLY GO FOR IT.
1243	0	a	I loved homefront but this isn't it very buggy on pc frame rate well below playable ... and we thought arkham knight was bad no love for pc gamers here
2931	1	a	I'm not sure why so many people are complaining? I've played for nearly 9 hours so far and I'm having a ton of fun; granted some early patches are needed, but I'm sure we'll see them in the coming days.
2933	1	a	I havent played this game long enough to comment on the gameplay yet and will update later, however I'll comment on the visuals and optimisation on the game after an hour of gameplay. I've managed to max out everything apart from shadows and it runs flawlessly on my gaming laptop Gtx980m i7 4810MQ (3.8GHZ when turbo boosted. I am really not sure why some people with a GTX970 are getting issues with fps and I saw someone claim their GTX970 cannot achieve more than 30fps with low settings! Well, this isnt the case for me at all, the game is running superb. Anyone who has played crysis before will feel the similarity with the weapon customization (cryengine). Graphically this game is pretty good but nothing ground breaking.
2935	1	a	It's so great to be back to unfold after the Golden Bridge! This Homefront 2 is inspire from orginal Homefront when North Korea invade to America. It's remind me of 'Turing point: Fall of Liberty' for PS3, Xbox 360 and PC, when Nazi take over New York. I really enjoy to be imagine what look like and WHAT IF it happen to our country, it make me roll up my sleeves to take action to protect our nation. I like it.  Just ignore those BS negative attack this game, they just WHINING over frivolous things. I give this game TWO THUMB UP AND FIVE STAR! :-D   Kupo!
2937	1	a	Edit: So after a few updates, there has been basically zero improvement for framerate. My advice to anyone interested in buying this game is to try it out for the two hours you can and if you like it and performance is fine, then keep it. The game is a solid B as far as story and setting are concerned. Performance is 'meh' throughout. If it runs well in the first two hours, you'll be fine. If it doesn't run well, it won't get any better so you're better off refunding it. I just finished the game and had a good time. I'd recommend it for people who like open world shooters, but there are other games that do this formula much better and have a better story. Still fun though. Solid B.  I am not refunding this game as I think many of the issues are tech related and can be fixed in a patch or two. If you're not sure about buying this, just wait unti a patch is released. I have a 6700k with a 980ti and I haven't had significant problems, though the game isn't optimized well and has fps drops. There have also been a number of bugs in shadows, hand motions freezing, sounds not matching with voices/guns, and textures not rendering. It's not as bad as Arkham or Unity as others are comparing it, but is suffering from bugs that are annoying.   As far as gameplay is concerned, it feels like a lesser version of FC. The gunplay isn't 'addicting' as FC, but is satisfactory though it takes some getting used to.  Don't know enough about the story to weigh in on that, yet. One problem with the game is its release date. There are many games releasing this same month that are FPS and that are significantly better (gameplay wise). It's a hard sell, honestly.
2939	1	a	Have to say this game has already given me some memorable moments.  After the prologue the first two times i found a bike i drove it like i have never driven any vehicle in a game, and proceded to nearly run over the koreans and my allies while barely missing buildings and vehicles. I don't use them anymore.  But honestly the game has enough flashy parts to keep you interested and the game has a nice difficulty so that i can't just grab the marksman rifle or assualt rifle and treat this like the coop missions in CSGO.   The characters are detailed, better than than that one game..... Division..... so you can easily like or hate people.  Honestly i was expecting something more like this from The Division.   My biggest gripe is that the campaign is not co-op, i enjoy even bad games if i can bring my friends with me, and this isn't bad.
2941	1	a	I really don't know what all the others are talking about. 11 hours in, I haven encountered any glitches and it's running quite well. It's not like the first part (Linear Story Shooter) but more like a FarCry in the Homefront universe. It's not as good as I was hoping for - but still pretty good.
2943	1	a	Runs great, I'm enjoying myself so far, Give it a shot, If you don't like it the trolls have velvet ropes and neon signs pointing to the refund page for your convienence...;)
2945	1	a	Well, i have to say i got one more best title in my life. Trully i'm really enjoying it, mostly i loved it's gameplay, visual quality, features, weapon systems and combat stuffs, location, in-game details, story. I actually like serious situations where we have to do something for our city, out country and our world. In these types of situations, you will get amazing missions to play with hard gameplay. So sometimes you have to be tricy and stealthy for hard atmospheres but sometimes you have to rush like hit and run. In this case, opponents gonna be serious and also seek for attack. So this title is just like my type, like what i wanted from developers. So let me explain about it in few topics.  Gameplay I got so much things to say about it. There is hella cool fun out there. We have so much things to do there. You will get tons of side quests and mini tasks as much as you explore it around the world. Also you would be rewarded with dollars if you complete these side quests and help civilians. There will be few civilians will ask you to help them like donating some dollars to beggers, releasing prisons, killing bullies and many more. In-game, whole world will be in control of KPA soldiers. Because they sorrounded the whole town and distructing it. So you can recruite your team soldiers around the town to help you to capture strike points, KPA strongholds, KPA covoys. Sometimes you need to use hack stuffs for hacking their Apex technology what is in used to sucure regions from revolutionary soldiers and recruits. So it's hella amazing.  Optimization We all know this game got some issues for bugs, FPS drops. But in my experience, i didn't yet face any bugs but FPS drops. It has to be fixed as soon as possible. Because it's not so cool for it. But i have to say this title isn't so well optimized. It's seems really bad on optimization. So not getting so high FPS. But playing on ultra high setting with all maxed out except AA.  Visual Quality/GFX I'm really amazed with it's visual. Seems so perfect and remarkable in all the way. But at night it looks far more amazing than it seems at day time. I can see they really putted perfection on it. Too much highly detailed breathing and lively world. So there is more fun to play at night situation with my recruits i choose. So you won't be disappointed for visuals  Coolest Features There are lots of amazing and cool features for best gameplay ever. Let's start with the smartphone you will get in-game for directions, journals, contacts, map, camera, identifications, emails, texts. You can use your camera to identify and mark hostiles and KPA threats. So it's really helpful for all of us in high risky spots where we have to be stealthy. With message feature you can contact with your alleys to direct you. You can craft hacking stuffs, pipe bombs, GTK stuffs. For crafting you can get resources around the world. Also you can buy them from safe house. In these situations you may need much more ammos, so you will get tons of stashes there but those are hidden for not showing KPA soldiers because if they get any stashes in their hands, they may remove them. Also you can upgrade your weapons for heavy armored cars, patrolls, goliath, turrets, KPA drones.  Lemme rate this title in few ways + Gameplay : 10/10 + Visual Quality : 9/10 - Optimization : 5/10 + Combating weapons and stuffs : 7/10 + Location and Details : 9/10 + Characters : 7/10 + Features : 10/10 + Background Scores : 9/10  Pros + Wise Storyline + Quiet Remarkable Gameplay Experience + Stunning and Gorgeus Visuals + Enjoyable Epic Actions + Serious and Effective Situations + Quiet Hard Missions and Side Quests + Helpful Recruits Available Around The City For Better Combat Action + Rocking Background Scores Matching With Situations + Atmospheric Situations  Cons - In-game Progress Saving Feature - No Crosshair -  So overally this is the best title for me in every way i experienced till now. Those who loved and enjoyed Crysis 2, they will surely love this one as well. Because gameplay situations and atmospheres are quiet familier. Let's burn them in the fire of revolution...
2947	1	a	ive played about 7 hour and am gonna review Homefront now... Im running a GTX 960 4gb and an I5-4690K  i clock in with about 50 fps on High settings with 1080p graphics. its not 60 but its still higher than HITMAN... The game looks beautiful and the movement is super fluid (movement is like a river that is super beautiful to look at and handle) If youve never played Homefront i suggest that you get this game when you can because its really fun. if you are like some people however and like to ♥♥♥♥♥ about not getting 60fps then you should wait to get it... I give this game a 9.5/10
2949	1	a	Amidst all the bad reviews, I'm glad I gave this game a chance. This is not a COD game where you can run and gun. You have to strategize, take cover, know when to fight and when to run. Once they sorted out the optimization issue, this game will be a solid 8/10 for me.
1245	0	a	This game was not enjoyable. 
2951	1	a	I have spent a few hours playing this and I love the campain. Good Story grest cutscenes. I framrate issues would be niced if they were fixed. I get well over 60 but I can watch my frames just dip in and out. I am ver sad that there is no pvp for this game. I loved the onld homfront pvp and was very sad that they did not include it. They do have onlione co-op but there are allot if network issues and its very hard to find other players to play with.  I would rate this game 6 out of 10 stars and so low becuse of the lack of PVP for a game that was built for it. I would say if you want a game that you would like to blow stuff up and shoot people and save people then this is your game.   Good Game but could have done better.
2953	1	a	Homefront holds up pretty well, plays a lot like a “capture the base game, but on the medium difficulty mobs are a bit bullet-sponge-y while the player dies super quickly. Also, there is almost zero bullet-tracing so tracking shots is very hard. Crossbow bolts get stuck on all sorts of invisible things :(  Also, when you get spotted by the zepplins you have about 20-30 seconds to get into a safe-haven or else you will certainly die, plus even if you get back to a compound you own, it will still be under assault (though the enemy will never re-capture it)
2955	1	a	In my opinion this game is awesome.The graphics and the gameplay are great.The storyline is ok too.One thing I don't like is that your character can not talk.
2957	1	a	not a bad game,give them a bit to work out the bugs..
1247	0	a	Homefront: Far Cry
2959	1	a	I just want to start by saying; if there ever is another game, i wouldn't hesitate to buy it..   Well... Here we go..  As a major fanboy of the original Homefront game, I was hoping to see a more polished/ extended version of it. In actuality, this game seems completely different (i'm not even sure if it's fair to compare the two).   While I was certainly suprised by what by what was delivered, the story seems fun enough, I am a little disheartened by the multiplayer. Which was something the original game did better than Battlefield 3 (before it became an 'unoriginal reboot every last detail except for the color of their eyes' style game). I understand that ther was quite a bit of trading hands over the lifetime of this game's developement, and im happy that it didn't turn out to be an utter mess. The story was greatly elongated and completely unique compared to the successor, which i consider a plus.  In the end, there are no other games quite like it, and i cant stress how refreshing the story was compared to the 'find enemy, shoot enemt, win' monotony of most games these days. Ithink that most AAA titles could learn a thing or two from this.
2961	1	a	It's got a slow start and it's buggy in parts but it's a damn fine game - AND it has two levels from Timesplitters in it. Personally, I enjoyed it but it might not be for you. I would make sure you watch some gameplay videos before making a purchase as this game isn't for everyone.  But I commend the developers work, after all the fluff they dealt with to get this game to market - It's a really solid product when it could have been a total flop. The developers obviously worked hard no matter the situation they were in to bring this game to life and it shows. A lot of love went into into and as I said, I enjoyed it quite a lot.
2963	1	a	LATEST AND FINAL UPDATE: I finished the game, 30 hours all told, and I really enjoyed it. I had one lockup after 27 hours, but that was it, otherwise it was great and mostly glitch free, one small bug that prevented a minor side mission from being completed, but nothing that effected the campaign. So, as before, I give the game a definite thumbs-up.   UPDATE: I now have over fifteen hours in and I'm still enjoying the game. The game world gets even more interesting when you reach the Ashgate Yellow Zone (which is the third Yellow Zone, if you include the first one you see at the start of the game). There is color and a whole different looking environment than the first couple of Yellow Zones.  And in those fifteen hours no crashes, no glitches and most smooth 60fps gameplay. It has slowed down at times, but the only way I knew was via the Steam fps counter, otherwise I never would have even known it's was doing 60fps. And damn, it's a really pretty, very detailed game.  ORIGINAL REVEW: I have in just under eleven hours on the Steam version and I’m really enjoying it. It does have some rough spots, but it’s a lot of fun to play. I like open world games and Homefront scratches that itch. I think combat is a lot of fun and the modular weapon system works great and is a nice change. The plot is rather thin, but really so was the plot in Watch_Dogs and it didn’t bother me. The game map is fantastic. I don’t have any issues with the “greyness of the Red Zones, there is a lot of color and objects around all that concrete. And there are tunnels and high catwalks and all sorts of paths to use.  I do have issues trying to access some of the harder to reach locations, the game doesn’t make them easy. However the designers included a clever system of using blue paint or flags to let the player know that there really is something to find and gives hints on how to reach them.  Some people have faulted the AI, but I’m finding them a challenge. They do seek cover when fired on, call in reinforcements and will flank you. And in the Yellow Zones, your stealth techniques really do get a workout.  It’s not a perfect game, but it is fun. And if it doesn’t break new ground in some areas, it’s better that the recent Assassin’s Creed games and as interesting (in a different way) as Far Cry 3 or 4. Fair warning however; it does take a good half-dozen hours before you really experience the complete gameplay.
2965	1	a	I found this game very fun and believe that the hate towards it is undeserved. While I have played it have only had about 2 frame drops total and they only lasted about 30 seconds. It also has a great weapon costimization process and it is insanely fun to use the flame launcher in groups of large enemies.
2967	1	a	Good game it's like a good far cry 3, no issue at all  amd r9 295x2 i7-4770 16go ram game is install on HDD
2969	1	a	I think ist great not a 10/10 due to tiny bugs and poorer performance than I would like but the core gameplay is fun and exciting and that's why I think people buy games, to have fun and this game delivers BUT there are still bugas and performance issues that they need to patch so if you really hate non gamebreaking bugs and not fantastic performance then don't buy but if you want a fun game then buy it.
2971	1	a	Take note that I have not come across any game breaking buigs yett nor many FPS issues like some. Gameplay wise, the game feels great! Its a Far Cry mixed with CoD feel. I love Far Cry and I like the fast paced gunplay that CoD brings to this game. Also, the gun customization is amazing! Feels great and is a lot of fun to make different combos with the weapons! This game is a solid 7/10 for me! With some patches maybe even higher! Still waiting on the Day 1 patch though!
1253	0	a	Like many others here, I have also had preformance issues. I well exceed the recommended specs, and it runs awfully. The game looks amazing for the most part, but what good is a sweet looking game if it runs like total crap. Maybe future patches will further optimize and improve frame rates, but as it stands right now it's unplayable for me.
2973	1	a	11/10 Crossbow is the most powerful weapon in the game
2975	1	a	After playing it for an hour and 40 minutes, I have to say I do like the game. The optimization is meh, but that comes with every single new released PC game.   Pros: Nice Graphics Nice Gameplay Fun Nice Music Fighting Missions are cool, Semi Realistic  Cons: The none fight missions are kind of boring Bad optimization AI can get buggy/glitch 
1255	0	a	5/10  Pros + Graphics + High tech drones + Weapon customisation  Cons - Visual glitches - Motorcycle control - BORING storyline
2977	1	a	Despite the complaints of all the reviewers, this actually is far from terrible.  With a bit more polish this would have been a great game, in the state it's in currently it's merely 'good'. There are a few bugs and some features aren't as fleshed out as they should have been, but none of it is gamebreaking and it won't severely affect your enjoyment of what is ultimately quite an engaging experience.   The combat is as good as any other AAA FPS, the environments/level design is gorgeous and varied, and the exploration is very fun. The devs have obviously put a lot of passion and work into this project, and through no fault of their own it's been hampered by studio bankrupcy and a slashed budget. Despite this, the game still shines and is very fun to play. A lot of effort seems to have been put into reducing the repetitiveness, preventing the player from getting bored. I'm about 10 hours in and I'm not getting that familiar dragging bored feeling I usually get when playing open world FPS's.   If you enjoyed games like Just Cause, Dead Island, Red Faction Guerilla, and Far Cry, you'll definitely like Homefront: The Revolution. If your PC is powerful and you're good at FPS's, you'll have a blast.    BETTER THAN: Farcry 3 and 4  WORSE THAN: Fallout 4

2979	1	a	Game is fine so stop people cry mine score 8/10
1260	0	a	Homefront: The Revolution is like that one really tasty looking candy that actually tastes like ♥♥♥♥. (If you don't get what that means, I'm trying to say it has good graphics but the gameplay is ♥♥♥.)
1261	0	a	What a miserable game! Terrible in performance, terrible in story, terrible in execution. I have a famously low tolerance for bad open-world games, but this tested even my virtue; it's so bad. Real bad. Don't buy bad. Maybe at less than $10 on sale, but even that's iffy; this game has very little redeeming features. The story is frustratingly horrible at the start, the gameplay is uneven and just poorly laid out in the beginning. Ugh. And the performance on a GTX 970 is close to vomit-inducing; I've neverplayed a game that made me have to turn it down to keep from hurling until now.
2981	1	a	 FarCry in America.
2983	1	a	This game is amazing, I know its had its performance issuses but ive had non of it even from the day of release. I would 75% recommend this game its fun to play as a resistance fighter, such a good game idea! If you want to play this game, id wait until a sale as it will come down in price alot! (also a TV series that is basically the same as this game is called 'Colony' its amazing)
1263	0	a	  atm its not running smoth for me. it dosent feel like a AAA game atm. Lets see what hotfixes are bringing
1264	0	a	THIS IS ♥♥♥♥. I wanted it to be good, but it is ♥♥♥♥ing awful.
1265	0	a	  Lot of movie... I wanna play...
2985	1	a	Co-Op is a lie. 'HomeFront: The Revolution' is tagged as Co-Op but the Campaign is single-player only and the co-op mentioned is an added section to play a couple of short missions together. If you want real co-op then you need something like Borderlands, or Call of Duty III; those give Campaign Co-Op.  The game overall is pretty fun but has several bugs, like AI that constantly turns its back on you, or marked missions pieces that you can't do, or a map that doesn't remove something you've already accomplished. Hoping these bugs will be fixed in the near future though.  It uses the CryEnging and plays a lot like FarCry 4 but on a much smaller map, not as open world, but in a city environment. If you are looking for something like that then it should scratch the itch.  I can't really recommend for or against it and would sit on the fence on this one. But Steam requires you to Thumbs up or Down, they don't offer a sideways, so I'll go with an up since there is nothing majorly wrong with it.
1266	0	a	  Lot of movie... I wanna play...
1267	0	a	EXTREMELY REPETITIVE. Good graphic's, thats about it !
1268	0	a	This game is broken in a game design and balanced perspective. First one was much better. And one more thing, this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ CryEngine, it plays so bad.. It feels like the game is not yet finished
2987	1	a	Its not as bad as these reviews. It has problems, but its stil better than most FPS's out there. If you can get it at a discount, then wait for a deal.
2989	1	a	I don't know why everyone didn't recommand this game it's acturelly fun to play the graphic is awesome(expecialy the shadow) but i don't know how the story is for now so i give this game 6/10 so far
2991	1	a	Homefront: The Revolution is an 'open-world fps' with some cool weapon conversions that change the way your guns behave and of course....maim your foes(KPA). And the game is just....Solid. Its not that great and its not that good. I have played for about 8 hours and cleared about half of the game. While the game is advertized as an open world game, it is actually more like open world segments that you can fast travel to and from. The story is pretty standard as fps games go. The characters are not that great, and your player character is silent. You take outposts held by the KPA and earn money for new attachments, weapons and gear to improve your silent character. Honestly it feels alot like Farcry,but with a slight post-invasion like feel. The graphics are quite nice on a GTX 960, and i dont really have any really bad bugs to talk about. Ign posted saying enemies just popping in, Ive never had that problem. As stated before the game is nothing to write home about. I was very stoked for this game when it was revealed, but now i am slightly dissapointed by the final product. The game is still fun with all of its weapon customization and solid fps gameplay, but the story is lacking. I was also dissapointed by the fact that there is no competitive multiplayer, however there is a coop mode but there is only about 6 missions that you can do as of now. And there not very intresting to say the least.  Overall i give the game a 6/10  Im only recommending because there is no 'Meh' option. I am enjoying the game thus far but its just a solid game. Ill play it for maybe another 15-20 hours then uninstall and let it sit in my library.
1271	0	a	Clunky. Clumsy and Uninspired.   I was really looking forward to playing this game. I was excited to hear that it was open world and you were playing a resistance fighter. Cool setting. Running around free running blowing stuff up and generally and kicking ♥♥♥♥.... well not so much of any of that…  You can only climb certain buildings at certain points so there goes the whole jumping around (it takes about 5 tried to jump over a f###ing railing) The ‘Open World’ is just quarantined cells that you cut between with some tunnels. Gun fights felt underwhelming, I couldn’t aim for ♥♥♥♥ with a controller. The controls just feel off to me. Not a good game. If you can get it under £20 then by all means give it a try. But to me this game is horrible.  You start locked in a cinematic opening that really had no f###ing point what so ever. You get introduced to some guy who seems to be the main leader but had absolutely no back up. Like he is the main inspirational figure and he had a pistol. Like not even a guy with him that gets shot in the head. Nothing. A pistol and then he gets shot in the leg. It just happens to make you try and give a sh##. I felt absolutely no emotional attachment to the man and then you are expected to run around and try and save him.  You spend half your time killing guys armed with some awesome guns but you cant pick em up and use them? Why? It was never explained. You don’t see them on the ground. I mean you even have friendlies that get shot and drop rifles and all kind of stuff. Can you pick them up? No. I saw a backpack for sale at the store and then came across a backpack in a shipping container. Can you throw it over your shoulder and use that instead of buying one? No. This game is seriously bad.  
2993	1	a	good game love it, the best open world game out there and the graphics are sick
1279	0	a	So, a big dissapointment. I'm not gonna write anything nice except for the graphics and weapon modding system. Other than that? meh. CoD MW easily topped this PoS. They said the updates are gonna be nice and such, but after the very first update I can't even open the game anymore. It's doesn't even crash bcs it can't be opened. Without warning, without anything. Just silence. And the multiplayer on PC will take ages for you to find one game, ONE!  3.5 out of 10  P.S. Seriously, this is a warning. I had high hopes for this game but they just dissapoint me. Very frustrated, not to mention it takes too much space for a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game -_-
2995	1	a	it's a fun game, feels pretty clunky at times with a cover system that works 50% of the time  Runs perfect on 650Ti Boost, all on Very High with 40+ FPS. Meanwhile it won't even boot on a 960 
1286	0	a	  Those puzzles require when capturing outposts/watchpoints ruined all those gaming experiences.
2997	1	a	Grabbed this+DLC on sale for 35 bucks, it's worth 35 bucks.  Also grabbed it because I wanted this kind of game from ARMA III, but haven't got it yet...   It's not really 'free roam'; you do roam freely, but the world is made up of comparment levels, interconnected by tubes, so still that old school Deus Ex, Postal 2 type free roam; not GTA or ARMA free roam...   THAT SAID; this is a fairly solid game so far in my experience, I turned most all details down to low and can run it fine on my 1 gig 550ti, 8 gig RAM five year old system with no sweat.  Story line and cinematics are pretty standard dramatic BS fair, rebels dress like rock stars; and don't seem fond of helmets... I donno... Anyway... Game play is good; shooting is good; explosions are good; lots of loot; could use more gibs; I haven't seen any gibs yet; why do all these new games fear gibs?
2999	1	a	Im 4 hours in and so far I like it. Ive done time on both single and multiplayer. There is a brutal occupation going on, and you get to go out into urban areas to blow people's heads off. The graphics are great, the bugs are just like every other game, and the controls and game mechanics are the same as far cry ... which is why I like this game so much. I loved blood dragon, and this is its meaner, grittier cousin. I give it 4 out of 5 stars. Higher to 4.5 if the modding community gets ahold of it for episodic multiplayer events. Sooner or later someone will mod some zombies, but maybe something new will be out there this time for these ♥♥♥♥ing Norks.  *9 hrs in and the game keeps getting better. I can see why people that only invested 10 mins give horrible reviews. The first mission takes awhile, so it will soil the experience for some.
1288	0	a	lags heaps and not much to the weapons
1289	0	a	This game is so broken it's too bad it look like it could of been good but instead it's a halfassed frycry reskin.   Get it only if it's fixed or it gose on sale really cheap
3001	1	a	to my opinion this game i rate 9/10, sometimees people dont realise how much effort this company put on this game, the storyline is good, completed it on 1st day of buying it, if people say this is a rubbish game then there wrong, if you have not played the first homefront then u dont adore the first series, this series however is amazing i would recommend, as you can rebel key parts of the american city of philidelphia, and watch the civil unrest, it just gives u a glimpse of the future, if north korea was to invade america, then yes this is the right game for you to take your anger out on koreans lol
3003	1	a	i was unable to get the correct graphics,also all of the other nesscessities in the game play area,my mouse was slow,picture was foggy,all in all very unhappy with the game, i am on pc with windows 10,at the moment would not recommend it to pc users i use a keyboard and mouse,i need 10 fingers on one hand,can you tell me the correct game graphics set up etc!
1290	0	a	the first game that showed me how to do a refund,

1291	0	a	the first game that showed me how to do a refund,
1292	0	a	I came Homefront The Revolution on Guerrilla Warfare. LOL. Is a lie.
1293	0	a	It's the launch of Aliens: Colonial Marines alllllllllll over again.  I haven't preordered a video game in over a year, and Homefront: The Revolution was the one to break the ice. That being said, the water beneath it was highly acidic, and here's why.  The lag is real. The game engine itself is my biggest complaint, since I can't even really play the game due to it. There's lag, and tons of gigantic black splotches on the screen that decide to obscure my line of fire at just the wrong moments, so that in tandem with lag and shaking around forces me to wildfire towards the Koreans, and absolutely forces me to avoid stealth gameplay, which ironically is the whole focus of this. It probably doesn't help that you move like Buzz Lightyear, blasting off all over the place when that isn't your intent.  The graphics in Alien: Isolation are far better than this, and A:I came out about 2 years ago; Isolation runs smoother than snow on a mountain in a Bob Ross painting, and it has phenomonally good graphics, and IT is (sort of) an open world experience, so there's absolutely no excuse for there to be such abominable lag.
1294	0	a	I bought it, played it to completion and I would say that it was mediocre in most every aspect.  The modular weapon system is annoying more than anything and baffling in some of the constraints (I can't have a grenade launcher and a marksmans' rifle at the same time what?)  Enemies randomly and infinitely respawning is really annoying - especially when they respawn right next to you or in a place they couldn't have gotten to (because you were in the way of the only entrance, for example)  While it might in theory be possible to evade line of sight of enemies and play cleverly, the placement of enemies on maps makes this improbable as there are groups of 2-4 enemies placed every 30-40 feet in some areas which means that any direction the player moves will result in detection by a new enemy.  Vehicles feel clumsy (with mouse and keyboard, anyhow).  One of the biggest annoyances in the game was that later on, my cooperative teammates were usless - they couldn't keep up with me and the lethal situations I had to bypass they would just run into and immediately die.  One or two of the missions are poorly done and extremely frustrating. In one mission you have to stay close to a vehicle that drives out of the area while being quickly destroyed by rockets. There are absurd numbers of other enemies around and if you happen to become their target you will quickly die.   The story is baffling, too. In the end you're left with no real feeling of victory and no reasonable expectation that the limited success you've attained you could hold.   The story is less open world than semilinear narrative, and in some places very narrative.  I can't recommend it for the price that it is listed at. This is a 30 dollar game, in all fairness.  MULTIPLAYER   I have not been able to join a multiplayer game. I don't know if they are working, or how they work but I've never been able to join one and never had anyone join mine when I waited.
1295	0	a	one of those games Steam refund policy was tested.
1296	0	a	Terrible let down and just a bad game all around, if they would have stayed with the original formula they would have had a smash hit.. I hate that they got my money for a game I wont / can't play..
1297	0	a	Fun game but needs more content.
1298	0	a	boring as ♥♥♥♥.
1299	0	a	Nice graphics, but a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ gameplay. I tried it for 2 hours on free weekend and i'm happy that i didn't waste my money buying this game.
1300	0	a	It's bad. I got a Achievement after i alt+f4'd to quit and uninstall.
1301	0	a	Single player is nothing special. Games like these are dime a dozen.  Co-Op multiplayer COULD be fun, excep for all the bugs.  The graphics get so messed up it is almost unplayable.
1302	0	a	Cringeworthy storyline and horrible keyboard/mouse controls.
1303	0	a	DONT BUY ! Save your money...  This game has really serious texture and fps problems. (yes, after the patches...) Some textures are not loading, in addition some texture like ps2 version. Examples, furnitures, graffities... And of course the artificial intelligence is really bad.(worse than assassins creed) I just played the prologue and the first mission and I send request return...  Sorry , I really want to play this game but it is not like what I imagined.   Dear producer,  Just stop selling this.
1304	0	a	  -Free weekend- Loved the story and esthetics but gameplay is brutal clunky FPS is what i would call it not what we have come to expect from Crytek. I wanted to like it more everything was right until you play.
3007	1	a	  culd someone get the game working
3009	1	a	  culd someone get the game working
3011	1	a	its really good but yea,dont buy if u want to play multiplayer without friend(hard to find player in multiplayer)im playing homefront from PS4
3013	1	a	I was one of the lucky ones. Somehow the hardware gods smiled upon me, and I got zero lag and artifacts. However, buyer beware, the majority of people are getting heavy lag issues. The reason i recomend, is that it is a very enjoyable game, but you might as well wait for patches and a sale. I wish there was a middle of the road button, it just didn't feel right giving it the thumbs down. I'm really enjoying myself.
3015	1	a	It's a very fun game but not worth 60$ wait until a sale then get it.
1323	0	a	very glitchy... terrible FPS you get fps drops as well... somtimes even as low as 5 fps on a good machine... this game is NOT ready to be released.. to buggy slow fps bad gun play.... ugh... i had to refund it.... was terrible for me i do not recomend this to anyone.... at least not yet... wait for the bugs and such to be iron out.. thx
3017	1	a	I really do not understand these negative reviews. I am enjoying the game and the only thing I can see being a problem at some points in the game is performance.
3019	1	a	After playing 1.2 hrs of the game and reading the reviews. I can understand why people are upset about the optimization of this game, but I will give my thoughts and what I have experienced so far in Homefront: The Revolution.   Settings and Computer specs:
1324	0	a	looks not bad , gun customs are awesome but boring as ♥♥♥♥
3021	1	a	I'm writing a review because that's apparently the thing to do with only a few hours of gameplay.  Does the game run smoothly? It has dips but it's not ruining my enjoyment. Does it have good gunplay? Yes. Actually some of the more interesting I've played lately IS IT FUN? Yes Are the weapons fun to use? Ahh, that's the golden goose in a fps isn't it? They are a riot. Everything is upgradeable and interchangeable on the fly. Your pistol can act as a silenced air powered assassin tool, a 9mm handgun, AND a .45 cal smg. You don't need to be at a workbench to change them up, you can do it during battle. Like your shotgun? Who dosen't, right? Well now you can turn it into a napalm launcher once you buy the upgrade. The versatility of weapons reminds me of the Resistance franchise on PS3 (which was known for it's insane weapons). Hows the sound? I'm not a huge sound critic but everything sounds balanced How does it look? One of the best I've seen How is the story? As I said, i'm not far in. But the KPA is obviously a metaphor for alt-history China in this Homefront (the last HF the KPA had no similarities to China). How are the controls? If you're using a m&amp;k I couldn't tell you. I am using a 360 gamepad because the BetterDS3 program bugs out in game, making my PS3 gamepad useless. I hope that gets patched. The 360 gamepad works fine. Is it stable? It hasen't froze or CTD'd yet. Should you buy it? That's up to you. I don't know why so many people are looking for someone to tell them to buy it. You're a adult (I'm guessing), act like a big boy and decide for yourself.
3023	1	a	I really like it.  It's alot like FarCry but the story is much better.  If you likeFarCry you will like this. It's pretty much that simple.
3025	1	a	I don't really do alot of reviews just wanted to touch on the issue people saying its poorly optimized not sure what's going but it runs beautiful maxed out on my rig...Loving it so far as well just glad to see another Homefront game out I played the 1st Homefront title until the servers were closed...Awesome game all round!!!!
3027	1	a	GTX 970 and I7 4790 3.6GHz at High resolution runs great (80-100fps) only some bugs with the civilians while walking (not that many just like in Assassin's Creed Unity) ! The performance isn't that good but was something already expected by me... It's a good game for guerrilla tactics, and for testing your patience (don't try the hardened it's really hard)   10/10- shoot the drones it's the best part of it !
3029	1	a	I didn't read the reviews before purchasing this game because I am not concerned with the opinion of the brainwashed masses. I actually pre-ordered this game months ago and never looked back. That being said if you are an adult with a job and their own money to spend I would recommend investing in this game. I am sure haters are going to hate because that is what they do. So let them do their jobs. Because truth be told, if you ain't got no haters you ain't poppin!  8.5/10 before patch. 10/10 after patch.  Guns-check Sandbox-check Asymmetrical warfare-check Underlying social commentary-always!
3031	1	a	Short play time so far but runs great for me with an i7 920, GTX 960 and 8Gb RAM, yep an old machine but still going strong and have no issues with performance. Gameplay, from the little I've currently played, is looking good and hadn't seen any huge issues with AI. So far I like it.
3033	1	a	Despite my low level rigs, i'm playing on high-ultra (not all ultra) @55-60 fps on combat, too.  The story, meh: you are recruited from the resistance of Philadelphia and have to free the leader (will i become leader myself?). Not the best, nor the worst.  Gameplay: is similar to Far Cry titles(conquer posts, free hostages and so on), only aiming is a bit more difficult (which is not bad). Tutorials take you till a certain point, then it's up to you if follow the main story or do secondary missions/recon.  Graphic: i'm liking it by now. It's 'enough' for me. You can check it by yourself on youtube, anyway.  Almost 3 hours and no bugs, no crashes, no passages blocked by npcs. I am probably one of the lucky ones.   I hope that it helps.   Sorry for my bad English.   
3035	1	a	did anyone actually look at the system requirements? running all settings except aliasing maxed - no stuttering, game looks nice, runs nice, and is rather interesting so-far. maybe people just don't like the idea of the norks being in charge?
3037	1	a	To be honest, I don't understand why this game has so many bad reviews. It is an excellent release, worth every penny. What they accomplished, being in the shoes of the resistance fighter, was done extremely well. This is not Doom or Call of Duty and even thinking about comparing to those is plain silly. You will not be fighting waves of enemies like Rambo. If you attempt to do so, you willl die very quickly. You are supposed to be adopting guerilla tactics, which involves a lot of hit-and-run, outsmarting the enemy, etc. It is an FPS in its own right and big props to the devs for getting it right. Also many concepts were borrowed from later Far Cry games, such as visibility indicators and take-downs and having played all Far Cry games, starting with first one, I can't say this is a Far Cry clone.  I hear many people are having performance issues. I am running it on MSI GS60 pro gaming laptop with 970 and it runs very smoothly, with the exception when the level has just loaded. I don't see any framerate drops and run on the high settings. Graphics are pretty good as well, not the best though.   The only complaints are NPC animations, which look a little clunky, especIally of other resistance fighters. Maybe also having an ability to drag bodies away would help, especially in yellow zones. AI can be stupid sometimes, where you can corner them in a small hallway with nothing else but a knife. In one of the yellow zones I managed to slice up about 15 or so soldiers with a little health damage. In an open firefight they are generally pretty good, hiding behind covers and flanking more often than not.  Would I recommend buying it? Hell yes! If you are concerned about price, you can get an activation voucher in other places for less.
3039	1	a	This game is a fun labor of love. Yes it had some of the usual glitches that have been my experience with cry enging games however what has been the draw for me is the story telling in the Homefront series and I thought that was pretty good. I am left left wondering how much better it could have been without all the set backs. The background small things were a good way to immerse you in this crappy situation that the characters are placed in. The weapon system and the way the different ways to go about every situation felt fun and kept things different as you start to retake the city. I look forward to playing with others.
1326	0	a	This game could be awesome. Graphics are awesome and so is the story. The game is plagued by it being un-optimized, no SLI or Crossfire, the latency is just absolutely unbareable. The latency is what makes the game hard to play. I will have to wait to until this game has some serious patch work done to it.   I do not recommend anyone to buy this game until further work is done with it to make sure it is optimized. I would rather have waited longer for this game to come out and be ready. GG
1327	0	a	I was promised a virgin by 'DUMBster' Studios :(
3041	1	a	 Last night, I just bought this game, as expected, fully in line with my expectations game is quite classic, I do not find any problems with my card or old GTX650, CPU is not very good. I still do not understand why some people want to listen to the media ratings, such as IGN.IGN the hell is it? I play the game, not the media. Review the media go to hell now! Thanks  Recommended purchase of: 10/10        
1329	0	a	Yo someone call Johnny Rico, the bugs have invaded this Homefront! This game is so bad.... unless you love bugs. Kill it with fire.

3043	1	a	 Homefront - The Revolution: Not a bad game!
1332	0	a	This was the worst $90 I ever spent in my life. $30 of which I never even recieved the product I paid for, Steam says contact the developer and developer plain flat out ignores me.  Deep Silver will never get a single dollar of my money ever again and honestly I hope they go bankrupt just like all the other publishers this franchise touched. Strap this anchor to your neck and jump off a pier you slimy ♥♥♥♥♥.
3045	1	a	Great game so far. Only issue ive had is FPS drop but it happens so infrequently its not a issue.
3047	1	a	So I went into this game almost completely blind, my friend and I were looking for a game to play together and didn’t find anything until I found this game. We waited until this game came out and bought it on release. We were reading the comments about how optimization was poor and how it was slow and lagging and etc. We both have very good computers and both of us were able to successfully load the game. As with many newer games you may need a decent computer. The graphics are impressive, and neither him or me experienced major issues concerning it lagging. This game has a really promising multiplayer although the story fell a bit flat. The multiplayer, in my opinion, is the best part of the game and I loved it for the first four(ish) hours. The small amount of maps limits the playability of the game since there isn’t a lot of different ways to play each map. Let me just say that this is a really fun multiplayer game with some interesting missions. The problem is there are what six maps, maybe seven? Half are based on offense and the others are defensive. I already payed $60 for this game, why do I have to pay about $6 for more maps that probably are the same type of missions. A lot of people are complaining about the bad AI, I disagree. The AI is pretty good at spotting you (and killing you). We only encountered a dead body glitching through a wall. In the multiplayer the enemies aren't always positioned in the same space when you start, and I really enjoyed that added challenge.  What I really don't enjoy about multiplayer other than the limited maps and somewhat repetitive missions, is that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ lady on the coms. 'What's the hold up!' 'What's the hold up!' Oh, I don't know? Maybe the two tanks that just rolled in? Constantly annoying me when I don't speed through a level. She is the Navi of Homefront. This also brings up another point, the game doesn’t want you to stealth. The knife killing animations are awesome, like oh my God watching another player knife an unsuspecting soldier is cool. So naturally, we wanted to try to do missions in stealth. After trying to sneak, we realized something: this game doesn't want you to sneak. Sure the snipers are easy targets for your knife, but on the ground, where you are most of the time, you have limited stealth options. No sneak rolling/running or anything that's common in games that want to provide a stealth option. Well you may be asking, 'well Guy Fieri this game isn’t meant for stealth, it’s about guns!' To that I would reply with saying that the game wanted to provide a guerrilla style warfare that is common in American war history. A part of it is sneaking. Also, in your skill tree you can pick up several sneak related skills like not being seen as easily by enemies. Why give me that skill when I can't get a silencer until I buy x amount of crates (which I suggest focusing on getting weapons and armor before attachments) and as soon as I fire every single enemy in the entire universe knows exactly where I am? This limits the ways to play their small selection of maps. Also another problem, that i'm sure a little later won't be a problem, I can't seem to find any servers? There is a story, and admittedly I haven’t played a bunch, but what I have played is average. Unskippable, boring cutscenes giving me unwanted explanations of the situation are the first ten minutes of the game. Then*spoilers* the two people you are with die. Walker gets arrested, and you go to the main resistance in the area. They get mad at you when you fall into their well marked tunnel and start beating you up before asking for authentication? No, i’m sorry you are the worst tunnel keeper in history.*end spoiler.* Again this is just the beginning maybe it gets better later, there are better people to talk about the story than me. I do recommend this game though, like I said the multiplayer is fun. One thing I find very impressive is that for the multiplayer to feel fun you don’t need another friend. Your mic is always on which I think gives a realness to the game. After taking away the good graphics, there is a good game. The gun mechanics are good and I really like the skill tree and the way you obtain weapons and gear. I think what would make the multiplayer better is obviously adding more maps for free, but also opening up areas for mass multiplayer games like a team deathmatch and capture the flag. Also I wish that in multiplayer and the main story we were able to customize our character, and I don’t mean picking from a few female characters and a few male characters. Overall 7/10.
3049	1	a	I find this game quite enjoyable, if you like the feel of farcry taking overplaces that is. The story line is well wrote the only issue I have had is a few minor texture errors.

3053	1	a	Great game so far. Only issue ive had is FPS drop but it happens so infrequently its not a issue.
1333	0	a	It runs very bad even on medium settings and the gameplay isnt that great. so as of right now dont buy it
1334	0	a	it is the worst game ever u might aswell of bought flappy bird 
3055	1	a	Amazing game stunning graphics great gameplay fantastic story. a must play.
3057	1	a	At 100% lived up to expectations !!!
3059	1	a	I went into the game not with very high hopes because from what i have seen people where getting bad fps, glitches all over the shop and bad graphics But I'm glad to say i have had none of that the game runs decent with not that bad fps drops and 96% of the time it stays at 60 fps.  For anyone wondering what setting im running it on im running on high at 1080p with vsync on pc specs: i7 5820k gtx 980 x2 in sli but i dont think this game has sli support so yeah (I have enabled it in nvidia inspector using the crysis 3 profile)  Game is really good fun and really impressed with the graphics as well they look amazing  however the game does need some patching before it will be 100% stable if you cant deal with stuttering i wouldnt buy it wait a few months or wait until its on sale because not everyone is able to run the game as well as i have been able to and you may not be as lucky as i was with it.   So good game but wait for a few months and or pick it up in a sale the summer sale isnt too far away and it will most likely be in it
1336	0	a	The first hour is ok. Then you realize you will spend the entire game shooting the same guy. Then you refund it.
3061	1	a	I bought this with pretty low expectations, and those expectations were met. It's not especially polished, no. It could use a LOT of work. But it has a lot of heart, and what is there is fun. It's a bit of a hot mess, but if you can put up with the occasional technical issue (of which there are many), this is worth a try.  Fix the stuttering please I want to enjoy your game more please.
3063	1	a	This game is made out to be a terrible and worthless game. I do agree, the graphics and gameplay could be better but the story and atmosphere is excellent! This game is totally worth purchasing, although do not buy if you have Windows 8/8.1! The game will not work unless you have Windows 10. I recommend this game to a casual to moderate gamer. It is fun to play when you have some free-time or on the weekend. PLEASE IGNORE ALL OF THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS, most of them contain stupid and irrelevant information. This game does have its faults but overall is great!
3065	1	a	I'll update this with more of a review, but it's pretty good.
3067	1	a	I am genuinely having fun with this game. The only issue so far is optimisation, the performance sucks in some areas, so wait for a fix before buying.  Other than that this is a fun FarCry 3 type game and if you like those games, you'll probably enjoy the change of pace from your usual jungles.
1349	0	a	Absolute trash lol, do not buy.
3069	1	a	I Have only really played co-op, but the performance isnt great.. but its playable, needs more weapons for free, maybe a few co-op mission, but yeah i reccommed it for co-op.
1350	0	a	Buy the first one instead. 
1351	0	a	it wont load up! I waited for this game for months, and when it finally came out i was quick to buy it. Huge mistake. I cant even get past the loading screen! I load up the game, 5 seconds later it crashes, and my PC is a monster of a computer! Alienware 17. How? HOW! ♥♥♥♥ this...
1352	0	a	Bad storyline, North Korea taking over the US? lol...No distinct symbols and culture of Korea, just some Korean spoken by futuristic soldiers..  Gameplay is like Farcry 3, but not so successful of course. Bad cinematics (u see people hitting other people and it looks fake). Not convincing voice acting, no vibe of revolution. On the other hand nice weapon modifications on the spot, and weapon upgrades. I got tired of it after 7 hours of gameplay
3071	1	a	Note that at the time of this review I had only played the campaign and therefore this review will focus on that and no this will not have any spoliers in terms of actual story.  Pros: Good weapon customisation  Very good campaign in terms of detail and story  Runs reasonably well on my PC and only had a couple of drops during the campaign (I know that some people have had problems with fps drops)  The easy difficulty is not a I win option in terms of difficulty and still offers a good challenge.  The health system is very good and definitiely adds to the challenge of the game.  Mixed (Things that were good and bad)  Good overall background story although disappointed that it was changed from the story in the original Homefront but I understand why it happened.  Although free to explore in the zones, I thought it would be truely open world like GTA V and that it seems to feel linear even though you can take over strongholds etc.  The A.I aren't idiots but they are not exactly the sharpest tools in the box either.  Cons:  Last part of the game becomes linear and back to the original homefront and other FPS games  Use of the RC car is quite bad and can be troublesome on things such as stairs  Campaign is quite short but longer then the original. I completed this campaign in about 15 hours.  Overall rating: 63/100  Not going to win any awards but it is definitely better then the first Homefront. I would get it when it is on sale if you don't want to pay £40 for it.    
3073	1	a	Look ma! I`m a guerilla fighter!
1353	0	a	10/10 graphics -5/10 gameplay donate and don't hate
3075	1	a	So far its a lot of fun, not the average FPS pay and spray your way to victory, but then also don't have to be a perfect ghost to accomplish your tasks.
1355	0	a	This is by far the worst shooter of 2016, and easily one of the worst shooters I've ever played. Right off the bat, I knew something was horribly, TERRIBLY wrong with this game. But, I guess that's just what I get for thinking that the sequel to the most mediocre game in history was actually going to be worth a damn.  For starters, the enemy AI is stupid beyond reason. Most of the time playing had them running into walls, shooting in the wrong direction, clipping through objects, or shooting one way while the bullets go another. I haven't seen AI this bad since RIde to Hell: Retribution. Frankly, though, this isn't much better than RTH, anyway.  The writing is some of the most incompetent ♥♥♥♥ I've ever witnessed. Every line of dialogue was cringe-worthy, every character a shell, every NPC an idiot. I thought Halo 5 had writing, but this is straight up incompetent on every level. The mission design is lazy, simple Point A - Point B run and gun shooting, taking buildings, 'talking' to NPC's, and after you claim a new stronghold, it immediately is decked out with American flags and sprawling with rebels. It's so jarring that I actually thought I was teleported to a different area of the map on several occassions. On one occassion, I had to take a stronghold with a Korean tank inside. The tank, out of nowhere, exploded, without any warning or reason whatsoever.  Kill me now. Please, put me out of my misery!  The multiplayer is an absolute joke. A series of co-op missions (of which encompass and grand total of TWO GAME MODES!) have you do the same exact things you were already doing in the campaign. The absurd nature of the plot does nothing to assist in the game's setting, the player customisation is an absolute joke, your body clips through objects incessantly, friendly NPC's clip through objects even more, and the freezes and stuttering in this game is ABYSMAL. I can run just about every modern game on Ultra and still pull off 45+ FPS (depending on how demanding the game is), so it's absolutely unnacceptable that this game, on MEDIUM SETTINGS, still freezes constantly. Movement is jerky and awkward, the gunplay is hit or miss, and half of the objectives in the game don't even work!  Seriously, no joke, at the beginning of the game, you have to set off a trap that includes explosive barrels. You have to simply press a button to detach the barrels and have them fall on the North Koreans and blow them up. One of the barrels (I couldn't make this ♥♥♥♥ up if I tried) actually got stuck, and it blew me up instead.  This is the ♥♥♥♥ing travesty of a game that this abortion of a company delivered.  I don't know why it happened, but Crytek apparently sold the rights to this game to some other developer I've never heard of, and it's clear that they have NO CLUE how to make a game. Do not play this. Do not rent it, do not purchase it, do not borrow it. It is the worst FPS I've played in years. This makes the last Homefront game look like a masterpiece. I actually enjoyed Major\Minor, the dumbest game of all time, more than this game. Refund it if you were suckered into buying it.  ♥♥♥♥ this game.
1356	0	a	I would send a boxed copy of this game to North Korea so Kim-Jong-Un can destroy this game with an AA gun.
1357	0	a	Literal downgrade, how can it be a good game, when it is no longer a Chris Kyle Simulator?
1358	0	a	  This game is like the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ browser games that try to rip off another game only it costs 40 Euro and is worse than the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ browser games
1359	0	a	Game sucks. It's no wonder why it went free during the weekend. And at that price, I'm going to have to say pass. Wait until it's like $5.
1360	0	a	don't buy this , too boring !
1361	0	a	Dont buy this game its just pure ♥♥♥♥, laggy and it looks like a game that would cost 5 bucks, but i costs 60 bucks... 
1362	0	a	That wast of money on DRM helped this game a lot /s
3077	1	a	Oh I'm sorry I thought this was a game about takin' back 'Merica from North Korean communist scum but turns out it's a game made to simulate, by way of bugs and horrid gameplay, the utter hopelessness and despair of life in a North Korean death camp.  10/10 would get tortured by shoddy game design again
3079	1	a	Edit: I've now ran an entire playthrough and have successfully completed the game on the standard difficulty so I figured I'd revisit this as I intended.   This might be the end of the Homefront franchise as we know it, if not forever. A disappointment I'll never get over. I wanted to love this game. Instead I tolerate it.  Initially I was scheptical about the jarring day one complaints and number of proposed bugs and issues many people seemed to be having that I simply wasn't. However after playing without issue for a few hours before taking a long break (a week or two) to allow some patching and otherwise cleaning up of the overall experience, I found that little had changed aside from that rediculous saving bug that occured every few minutes, forcing frames to drop to near zero as the game autosaved. I still experienced choppy visuals and framerate issues as well as god awful bugs like repeating or broken sound clips, xbox and PS4 controller prompts for buttons I'd recently seen a keyboard shortcut for, the usual tripe. There was nothing that prevented me from proceeding through the main campaign or the flashpoints but they were still everywhere.  Gameplay is thoroughly average, you capture bases and take territory, you kill some norks, you ambush some more norks, you use resistance boobytraps to launch norks thirty feet into the air, the game truly is just a run and gun affair with some not so nice stealth mechanics thrown in.  The gun play might feel floaty (I have aim assist off) and the recoil might seem excessive if you're used to current gen shooter mechanics- I'm looking at COD here, not ARMA3, so prepare for a vague learning curve on how weapons and the very basic cover system work together- though as a shooter it flops around like a fish out of water by comparison to superior releases in the genre.  The cut scenes and key character models are marvelous, but seem wasted when you look at the sub-par AI and the repetitive skins used for some of the civilians or non-essential fodder. Though I've not had any of the issues with people witnessing enemy vehicles simply not reversing when they hit walls etc, I have seen some less than stellar combat where enemies don't flank, they don't seem to adapt, they don't seem to think at all. They shoot at you, they duck, they run somewhere else thirty yards away, duck and shoot, and lets not forget the charging blindly at you around a corner deal. They sure like to rush you. Just like real combat! Not.  I'm getting a little ranty but I felt like given how hard this game has been nailed to the wall, I have to give it some credit, it went through a terrible development process and an even worse development cycle and it certainly shows on the rougher edges- but I DID have fun, and where the visuals are nothing ground breaking for 2016, I'd gladly say they're keeping up with many current shooters whilst not establishing any really new trends of their own.  TL;DR? Proceed with caution, read the reviews, check out up and coming patch notes and maybe try and grab this one on a sale. I don't feel it warrants a negative review but just barely earns a positive one. When you waited as long as I did for this game, only for it to get squeezed out of the digestive tract of a series of less than stellar studios or developers and handed on for someone else to clean up? Well it more than pains me to say it was thoroughly average.
1364	0	a	this game is very bad I mean the controls the camera the movement are all wrong...its like the player is drunk!! You can't Aim you can't shoot and that pretty much messes up all the gameplay...The Devs Idea was good but overall it fails to live up to its expectations!! DON'T BUY IT!!  played 4 hours and uninstalled it...trash!!!
1365	0	a	Loved the first Homefront. Fighting outside a lumber liquidators with a modern enviroment was awsome. Now move onto the second game and it falls completly short. Not only can you tell the game has been passed around from studio to studio but it seems as each studio got ahold of the game they tried to cram in there special bland style. The games mechanics are dated and poor. The future tech is boring an overused. All the second game needed to do was pick up where the first one left off. The copy of every ubisoft go here kill bad guys and activate outpost is dated and boring at this point. The guns are a total let down compared to the first game. The second Homefront is a step backwards in almost every way. The devlopers took no time to add something new to the game and advance the series forward. Half the time I dont think anyone on the dev team even played the orginal game.  This is probbly the death of the homefront series and that is sad becuase a fight for Americas indapenence red dawn type game is something that is not done very often or done well. Very unexplored genre.

3081	1	a	I dont understand why people hate this game so much, for me it's something worth trying AI sucks but overall gameplay is good :)
3083	1	a	I got exaclty what I expected from this game. Its like a cross between far cry and dying light. I have a 960 FTW and other then some frame drops after cut scenes it's great.
3085	1	a	Been playing since the release. Being in the American service I like killing the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who took over the country I love. It's beautiful, and it's finally a large scale first person that doesnt seem 'filtered'. The gun customization is pretty gosh darn creative, and the scale of AI warfare is great, flipping amazing for the graphics (which is eye candy) The only issue I have, is how dumb the AI are. They are plentiful which is good but they also get in the way. Like, a lot. Friendlies blocking doors and never ending hoardes of badies (and friendlies) coming out of the wood work looking to make a kill. The game is a challenge (the good kind, enimies main style of attack is like previous asian style warfare, aka numbers for strength). A huge step up in the face of the previous Homefront and a total screw you in the face of the dreaded moster Ubisoft. This is a GOOD game. Just take it with a pinch of salt. I hope to see some fixes, maybe smarter AI?
3087	1	a	Its a diamond in the rough, if and I can't stress this enough 'if' the developers are commited to bug fixes and post launch optimization it will be able to claim a place as an 7.8/10 game. The game itself is good and you will enjoy the time spent while playing, it is just mared by either gameplay bugs or graphical artifacts that distract you from what is basically  'Skyrim with guns' in america  Pros: - Gun Custimization feels fluid and allows quick adaptation. - Graphics look good with well defined styles for each area - Well designed world layout - Multiplayer is a fun co-op experience if you have friends to play it with, think Mass Effect or Dragon Age Inquisition.  Cons: - Bugs aplenty - Voice acting is similar to most other Deep Silver games, decent but not great - Story is very short in terms of how much time you actually spend doing the missions - Unskippable Cutscenes
3089	1	a	AGAINST COMMUNISM !!!
3091	1	a	I reccomend this as a SOLID shooter that will bring 10x the fun as the latest Far Cry or other of these titles that have become a tad repetitive this last season. Graphics are boosted &amp; are wonderful(even for lower end users!). There is alot here so far, although that aspect I would have to revisit upon completion as far as length and true depth. I'm actually about 8 hours in roughly, and it really feels theres lots left to do, &amp; Im hoping thats the case. Before specuilating any further on story, I mean the beginning has been exciting, but where it goes from here I'm not sure yet, but I DO feel there is enough fun here for me to reccomend. ALTHOUGH, there will be an update shortly as per full content..All in all, voted up because of how awesome it feels &amp; that everything is there that can be fun for most of us, I have set up explosives SOOO many ways, and only scratched the surface of customizations, I mean everything IS here for an awesome experience, and frankly its scratches that itch as theres really nothing else quite like it for the time being(from my perspective anyway?) You really have to play it to get it, it runs SMOOTH, I'm crossing my fingers it persists and grows on story more throughout the game, so yeh def. will be an update to this review... **Also, I should mention that I could not find a game last night(at 2am) for the co-op play, can't explain why yet, wether it was the time, or is dead already, so will update this aspect too.** But even as a single-player experience(so far) I am having fun &amp; excited to play more. **I'm STILL waiting for more gripping storyline in this game, rrgh, and well I think it was smart of them to make the AI so unpredicteable and challenging cause thats what brings me back to wanting to play more, Ive been doing a boatload of the side missions first as thats just my tendency, but seriously the last update I make to this WILL be adressing the story, as I want to be further along to be sure it soaks in before critiquing in totality. **NO MULTIPLAYER, AND DISSAPOINTING AS THE FIRST HOMEFRONT ACTUALLY HAD A REALLY FUN MP THAT WE ALL WERE HOPING TO SEE IMPROVED UPON FOR THIS RELEASE, I MEAN THATS WHAT WE ALL WERE THINKING, AND WAITING FOR. THIS IS VERY SAD** THE MULTIPLAYER IN THIS VERSION IS BROKEN, &amp; ID ACTUALLY LOVE FOR THEM TO OPEN THIS TO MODDING OR DO A FULL MULTIPLAYER RELEASE THEMSELVES, A HUGELY MISSED OPPERTUNITY TO IMPRESS THE FANS, LIKE I SAID, SAD. THE STORY TURNED OUT TO BE MEDIOCRE, NOTHING REALLY CHANGES OR HAPPENS THAT LEAVES AN IMPACT. FELT A TAD RUSHED &amp; AS IF THINGS ARE MISSING, I ALMOST FEEL I WAS TOO EXCITED AT THE BEGINNING, THEN IT FELL MORE FLAT.. OVERALL GOOD, NOT FANTASTIC, LOOK FOR A SALE..
3093	1	a	Love it!
1372	0	a	This game is buddy, I have had to repair the cache just because the game would not load correctly. Sometimes people will be invisible, or items needed ot progress the story will disappear if you reload your checkpoint. So technically, it has a lot of issues.  The gameplay is really bland as well. The shooting seems really clunky, and i never feel like im totally accurate, and I should. It is just not crisp at all. In the 2 ish hours that I played, it just seemed like there wasn't much content whatsoever, I was doing all these story missions, but I didn't feel like I was progressing the story at all. It almost felt like the story missions where more like the side missions.   At teh end of the day, this game is just not all that much fun.
3095	1	a	I get the hate, but at the same time I really am enjoying this game. Its kind of an open world Half-life. At 3440x1440 resolution Im getting solid 60fps, sometimes more. Granted I copied the SLI bits from RYSE and pasted them over to Homefronts. But that little copy and pasting gave me 90% utilization in both of my 980ti's. Who knows, I may grow bored of this game the more I play it, but right now its pretty fun!
3097	1	a	So far this game is really good laggy in some parts but that could be do to the fact that it is loading the area. The best way to describe this is Far Cry in a Urban Setting. I really do like the story maybe thats because I was fan of the first one but none the less i think think this game is really good.
1373	0	a	Poor optimization on pc, graphicall and technical bugs from the very first moment. High, medium, low settings - does not metter - game lagging. I could finish my first battle - was killed because the game lagging. When I start to play I found that this game looks similar to Metro, Stalker...  Going to return. Don't need this.
1374	0	a	Save your money the story is horrible and no one plays online. I bought this for the story and was disappointed. The enemies can find you through the walls and its impossible to be stealthy. It pushes you to be call of duty. I only recommend it for those types of non strategy shoot them up types of players.

3099	1	a	I love this game, now true I do wish there was a little more to do in it. But in the long run I enjoy the game play.  P.S I don't know where people are getting that it doesn't run well because I have mine on high and there are no problems, it sounds more like people just don't have the right computer setup. Remember a big beautiful graphics card does not mean you have what you need to run the game.
3101	1	a	My short review:  + good looking graphics + good looking world design + good looking guerilla weapon design + good story + good gameplay (you see your own body when you look down) + well done weapon and charakter customization  - bad optimization - not really open world, loading lvls - not many weapon attachments - really stupid AI
3103	1	a	ill say it right now: they had a line to reach, and they missed it. not by much though.  pros: guns sound and handle well (by sound i mean reasonably realistic) graphically pleasing- there is a con ill talk about later fairly large map funny AI- another con ill talk about the co op mode is fun af, specially when you realise that you can kill yourself and your mates with one well timed bike dismount you can make a co op squad of old people (female and male) and kick ♥♥♥. Norks minimal gameplay bugs- bar the AI ones. yet to see any micros- remember reading about them being in game but seem to have disappeared.  cons: optimisation is needed hardcore. AI, both friendly and enemy, can go full potato- stuck on random objects, block doors, teleport, randomly spawn/despawn infront of you etc hoping for more co op content. even main story co op (maybe) very minimal realism in death (guess they didnt want to up the rating)  would i recommend this game? not at full price. worthy of a steam sale purchase.  season pass is up to you, id recommend just getting the bundle- ON SALE.
1378	0	a	O, This is one of the worst AAA game i've ever played. Plays like ♥♥♥♥, looks pretty good , and its buggy as ♥♥♥♥. How can anyone like this game is beyond me.
3105	1	a	You know i don't see why this game has so many complaints , personally I f****n love it so much
3107	1	a	I recommend you wait for a sale.
3109	1	a	I've never written a review before, but seeing all the negatives about this game, i felt i had to put my two bobs worth in. In the time ive played it, ive realised you cant play it like a normal shooter. You havent got the firepower to match for a start, so the game has to be treated with a stealth approach, avoiding rather than confronting. once you take a few zones and meet some resistance fighters, the weapons become heavier, and you can go on the offensive a bit. I'm enjoying the game, playing as a guerilla fighter, not a combat soldier. There are one ore two frustrating aspects of the game for me. 1. lack of saves are a bit annoying, but at least when you revive, you've still got your cash. 2. The enemy seem to be bullet sponges. You can hammer away at them, and they take ages to go down. I find if you buy a scope for your battle rifle, headshots do the trick. I'm givng this game a positive review, simply because i'm enjoying a lot of stealth, and a few good firefights. I've had absolutely no tech problems so far, so fingers crossed. I bought mine as a 5 disc set, because the Aussie dollar is too low to buy on Steam, but still qiuite a costly game for those who don't like it.
3111	1	a	[AMD LAG/Microsutter FIX] For Slow PCs    Set launch option parameter in steam: '-USEALLAVAILABLECORE'  Increase memory page (PAGE FILE) on hdd to 7gb :)  Update AMD drivers to 16.5 + BIOS   In AMD settings, override tessellation settings and FORCE to OFF   This works for X4 750K + HD7770 40 FPS CONSTANT!!! (OFC ALL LOW)
1380	0	a	Oh God, I shoulda just listened to the negative reviews! So should you!!!!! Go and buy a positively rated indie game for a few bucks instead of this!  This game, it's like torture and I should mention that I bought it when it was 40% off, it's some sort of purgatory, the more you play the more you descend into madness. T-the graphics, the story, the controls the blatant copying of Far Cry 3,4 and Primal, the voice 'ACTING', the ♥♥♥♥ing voice acting!!!!  To the developers I gift this super dank meme: 'I'm Michael Jordan, STOP IT, get some help.'   And to you dear reader I give my rating of a: Would rather just replay MGSV than this ♥♥♥♥/10  But for real this 'game' is like the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ cousin of Ride to Hell Retribution.  4/10 - 'All you had to do was follow the moonrail Brady!' 
1381	0	a	in the beginning the game star with a very good flow and story, it look like a very good open world game, but after 2 or 3 hours everything became boring, same missions, same stories, everything like before, open world features are very weak, it seems to be open world but always you are bound in a small city. no car, no airplane, just walking, weaopens are good and funny.  just near the end again story find itself and became good with a very good ending.
3113	1	a	The game turned out to be unexpectedly fun. There is a gigantic open world environment that is interesting to explore. There is a surprisingly complex weapon upgrade system, vehicles are supported and there is stealth gameplay. The game is a mess in many ways ... It is readily apparent that the details were a secondary concern in this massive, almost bloated, game. For example, when you use a flashlight, the illumination drags behind the camera movements ... to simulate a hand actually holding a flashlight I guess? The end result is that you feel seasick and disoriented from using one of the basic tools in the game.  The main missions are diverse, but the experience is very incoherent. Remember how Valve makes an effort maintain the first person perspective with free camera movements in both combat, traversal, and story beats? This game is kind of the opposite. It feels like a patchwork of disjointed parts.  Performance is a mess in large open world sections, that make up the majority of the game, even when using a Titan X.   This game reminds me of an infamous classic in the open world genre: Do people still remember Boiling Point: Road to Hell from the russian developer Deep Shadows? Both Homefront and that game are reaching for the stars on a too limited budget. The game systems are bloated and lack refinement, but they are overcompensating by providing a lot of content and scope. It kind of works, I guess? Homefront definitely feels like a unique take on the open world genre, just like Boiling Point did in its time. Just don't expect a smooth ride, because this game is full of bugs, confusion and questionable design decisions. Take it or leave it?
1385	0	a	Trash Game
3115	1	a	OK im just gonna get right down to it   The story is rather cliché but the gameplay is actually quite good i mean yes you have that generic open world thing of reach these locations and hack this thing to open up the map a bit and see where everything is.  The weapons and gear customization is very good lots of options and i particularly like the Crysis style attachment menu.  i definitely recommend this game for those just looking for a couple hours of shooting and then be done with it, That's my review of this game but the stuff below is more of a request/me begging  HOWEVER the best thing BY FAR in this game is the part where you are in the restricted zone and you can find an Arcade Machine .. which can i just say needs to happen full scale.. as in bring those games onto the pc as a port PLEASE that NEEDS to happen.  what i mean by that last statement is this    Timesplitters 2 is in the arcade machine with full mouse and keyboard support and 2 levels and so i want to urge the developers to bring all the Timesplitters series onto the pc     i don't care how .. it just needs to happen.
3117	1	a	The games missions may not be the best, but the general gameplay and free-roam possibilities, as well as the gunplay, customization and world progression area really keeping me hooked on playing.  Short Version: Pros - Graphics are amazing. Free Roam is excellent. Gunplay and customization is very good. Variety of things to do in the world keeps things interesting.   Cons - AI could be improved. There are *some* bugs. Aim Tracking seems a bit off. In Game cutscenes aren't the best. Story isn't very deep or interesting.  All in all, I'm really enjoying playing. I'm 8.3 hours in, and I intend to play a great deal more. I have more fun in the freeroam than doing the campaign missions, and this will most likely be where I put most of my time in the game.  In depth:  Pros -  -Graphics are amazing, providing your PC can handle them. I know there have been some issues with performance, but so far I haven't encountered many issues.  -Free Roam World is excellent in my opinion. There's always something going on. The patrols are well placed. Red Zones are hectic and war like, with yellow zone activity being more based on stealth. The balance of human enemies and drones is well handled, with the enemies managing to be challening without being unfair.  -Gunplay and customization is very good. I've had a whole lot of fun with the feel of the guns and the customization, and the progression of these systems is well handled with points being unlocked for completing actions in the world. The attachment and conversion system is very interesting, and allows you to have a large amount of tactical options available whilst only carrying 2 primary weapons and a pistol. Recoil feels good and is countered by the grip and sight attachments, as well as the weapon upgrade system.  -Variety of things to do in the world keeps things interesting. There are plenty of mini objectives to complete in the world. From doing side missions such as taking down patrols and photographing enemy agents and drones, to capturing bases, destroying strongholds and saving the people from enemies.  Cons - -AI could be improved. Sometimes I do find that the AI aren't very smart. There can sometimes be no reason behind when they hide, and when they push up and attack. Whilst this keeps the AI unpredictable and interesting to play against, it can lead to them making some stupid moves, such as running up a staircase in a line to be killed one by one. I haven't had much of a problem with bad AI, but it is noticable. -There are *some* bugs. I haven't encountered many graphical or game breaking bugs, but I have noticed some. The 'free running' movement system sometimes seems strange. Some times you may grab ledges, and sometimes your character may miss them completely leading to you falling to the ground hurting yourself. This can sometimes be annoying, but isn't game breaking. The majority of bugs I have encountered are audio bugs, with some non-major audio such as music and background effects muting themselves during cutscenes, however they soon return and haven't had too much of an effect on gameplay. -Aim Tracking seems a bit off. You can easily tell this game was made for consoles first and foremost. You can't rebind some keybinds, such as holstering your weapon, which is essential in blending in and is stuck bound to the '0' key. Aim assist starts on by default, and leaves the mouse feeling sluggish, and is best turned off. Also sometimes you can take shots with your weapon that very clearly hit, but will not register. It's unknown why this occurs but it's noticable with most weapons. Whilst this only happens rarely, you don't want to be shooting a rocket launcher at a truck, only to have the hit not register and you die because of this bug. -In Game cutscenes aren't the best. The models can sometimes seem desynced and animations aren't the cleanest for a cryengine game. However, this can be ignored and doesn't take away from either the story or the gameplay. Overall I don't really count this as a drawback, as I'm more interested in the free-roam gameplay than the story, but if you are majorly into your storytelling, this may annoy you. -Story isn't very deep or interesting. Whilst the game takes some time to put a gun in your hands, which feels quite nice and well paced, you spend most of the start of the game with people talking down to you like a baby in a pram, whilst your silent protagonist lets himself walk into strange situations that don't seem to really progress the story. For example *spoilers*, your taken hostage by your own people, and have to sit through a cutscene for about 5 minutes that doesn't really add anything. One word from your character would skip it, but instead you have to sit through bad animation and pointless storytelling for the sake of it. Whilst only a minor issue, I still found this annoying.
3119	1	a	Homefront: The Revolution is a good game. It does not reinvent the genre, it does not blow you away with new, innovative features. It handily delivers you a perfectly average shooter. I personally have not experienced any performance issues (GTX970, i7-4790k on high settings) but I understand that lower performance rigs may have issues. Probably not worth $60 but definitely pick it up when its on sale.
1389	0	a	Gasmestopper bug, cant advance the story. And I'm not going to start over which is the recommended 'fix'
1390	0	a	Trash Game
3121	1	a	This is a really fun game single player and multiplayer, I just love it, I dont mind the graphics, bugs, glitch cause for me this is a really good game cause its still new and the gameplay are fun
1395	0	a	this is the politically correct way to make a game about the second american revolution.........
1396	0	a	Crashed three times in twenty minutes.
3123	1	a	The game is a lot of fun, despite some issues with bugs and glitches here and there. Once they have been patched, I reckon it will be an extremely solid, fun semi-open world shooter.   The story is patchy, and pretty bland, but it's passable for a shooter.
3125	1	a	its okay .. feels like farcry but in the city with norks not the best game but not that bad
3127	1	a	Been having fun taking back Philadelphia from the kpa! The weapons are so unqiue how they can be modded into 3 different types of weaponry. Graphics are gorgeous, I find my self just taking screenshots of the scenery and gameplay.   As for how many hours you can put into this game, I've got 68hrs and still haven't finished the main story line.Exploring and capturing all the kpa bases is so much fun to do, so alot of my time is spent in that.
3129	1	a	First off I am on a AMD FX 8350 eight core 16G of ram with a nvidia 970 and i run windows 7.. Game runs great for me I dont understand why all the negative posts and reviews. When i check most of the negative posters dont even have the game and they couldnt have gotten a refund that fast to have it removed from thier account. So why the hate?    Anyway cut scenes were good, voice acting decent. Graphics decent Gameplay is very similar to Dying Light with all the climbing and such. Neat traps all over the place for you to use just like dying light and loot is all over.   Fun game I just getting into the campaign , have not tried multiplayer yet but thats soon
3131	1	a	After 6 hours and cleared some zones I can clearly say that I'm just having fun with this game. Don't get me wrong, the performance is not good for half of us, I had to low down too much things for my taste, but if this is patched, you have a decent semi-open world shooter with a story I pretty much like and lot of side stuff to do. Yeah, it's repetitive, but If repetitive tasks is not for you, then I recommend to never play a game haha :)  You unlock parts of the map like a Far Cry game and you loot and play vertically like Dying Light sometimes, and that's a good thing. You also feel that you are in a rebellion, the atmosphere is good and the graphics are enough to believe the world you are in. There is so much little details everywhere that you know they worked for real on the level design. The controls and gunplay are ok, sometimes you try to jump in a window and it does not work at the first try, guns have good recoil but I like how you feel like an actual street rebel who can't shoot instead of a genious army shooter with 150 years of experience lol. AI get stuck or is a little dumb here and there, but nothing game breaking at all, you know, funny bugs.  It's clear that it's not the perfect game of the year but for me it's a pleasant FPS with a story I like.  Gaming culture is at its worse at the moment I think. It's like nobody can enjoy a game anymore. I'll be fair tho, if the optimization is not fixed, wait for it to be fixed before buying, or enjoy the game anyway like I do because the world don't turn around me and anyway the gameplay is fun. I know everything positive will be thumbed down maybe here, and negative will we thumbed up. I see no reason at all to take a side, it's just my opinion and opinions differ. Thanks for reading and if you speak french and have this game, add me for some coop missions (campaign is solo).  Update: I finished the game and I had some good hours with it. I think it's another hidden rough gem for old school FPS fans.
1401	0	a	  Played it and finished it during the free weekend. One of the worst games I've played in recent memory... Not worth your time at all. Find something better on Steam. Not even worth it for free. Terribly designed puzzles are like complicated math problems. The game brings you more pain than entertainment.
3133	1	a	 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOVx2sek-ME    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-SNjPbL0tE&amp;feature=youtu.be   This is an acceptable game but not good game. The graphics are amazing because the devs were smart enough to use the cry engine which kills ue4 or id4 for me personally having issues with the other two engines with other games.  The good:  Price compared to other AAA titles Intro is outstanding Graphics are amazing. There is story building and interesting cutscenes and dialogue compared to the crap that is thrown to us these days where the only goal is to make a quick buck. The sound is great and i like the background music creating mood. Drove a motorcycle.  The bad:  I have come across several issues where the last check point save would bring me back to the wrong place. Also in the first mission at one point it would not trigger that it was actually completed and stuck sort of in a loop.  Gameplay feels like Far Cry to be honest. Use the transceiver to discover items in a map. Parts of the map you would capture your team would move to. There is an armory.  Weponary seems basic and limited to weapons made of scrap kind of like metro because of the limited resources your faction/resistance group has.  I found AI to be quite dumb in most situations where they would just run at you and I easily killed 3 guys that walked in a row without sneaking on them. Sometimes i was surprised that the AI used grenades when I was hidden or would shoot me through a window when i passed by. Therefore there is some balancing to be done. Ai system felt like the one in gta when there are 1-5 police stars because at one point there seems to be a bunch of them that spawns somewhere if you create too much havoc and an aircraft shows up so need to gtfot.  This games needs a patch to be good but now it is acceptable.  I have no graphics problem and I have 3.9ghz 4700k intel and an old r7 2gd plus 24gig of ram and runs perfect so I do not know what the complaints are about.
3135	1	a	Looking at other peoples reviews, im starting to think that most people just like to ♥♥♥♥♥ about anything they can find,, i dont know any of that bull crap geek talk or what half that sh!!t means,, the game runs good on my old as Sh!t comp, the online coop is amazing and lets you go about it how ever you want, and the single player is huge.  the game play is fun and when u sneak behind someone and take them down you stab them in the throat with a knife. what else do people want aside from pointless dealth...
3137	1	a	Finished with the Game. Now for the review.  With all people say about it you may be inclined to think negatively as well, but this game, is a work of marvel.  Pros: Unique story True to the guerrilla way Feels like a revolution Awesome graphics Massive map Gun edit on the go Good multiplayer   Cons: Many, Many Glitches Some of the aforementioned glitches can hook story Shooting isn't very lively Frame rate drops when saving The realistic story removes action, for those action lovers, pass on it.   Basically speaking, the game takes a different route, and is definately worth playing, but if you think you'd rather wait till patches are made or you do not like games without much action, pass on it. After seeing the IGN review for this game I lost all respeck for IGN rreview system. They rate the game like its meant to be COD MW3 when it is it's own kind of unique.   P.s: if u get stuck in a part where a glitch gets you, remember if you go to story you can load a previous session 
3139	1	a	Dead Island with better voice acting. Zombies have been replaced by Koreans.   So far so good.
3141	1	a	The game great..but no without its bugs..the game is not as bad as ACOM and Duke Nukem was....not sure whats with so much of negative reviews floating..i find no FPS drops...  http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/278473670207782226/B2EE1F84D7A18595284E5774A4EEA2DD9A873523/ 
1409	0	a	In my personal opinion this game is horrible...It feels like its trying to be like metro last light and dying light... the gameplay dosent feel right, Im runinng two gtx970s and i74790k cpu so i get 60 fps at 1080 no problems but when you look at the characters you can see that there feet arent touching the ground, they walk like there two different body sets like the top half and bottom half.... I will say you wanna see something really funny and wierd just look and the faces of everybody and how the expressions change and glitch just ahhh man this game is so bad
1410	0	a	The story sucks and the words aren't with the mouths of the characters. I preordered the game and now im getting a refund. :)
1411	0	a	Good luck trying to customize your controls, cause if you do those keys will bind however some keys (like the middle mouse button and v) have secondary uses so you cant use these. Funnily enough it gives you the option turn of toggle ads but no option to toggle crouch or sprint so yeah have fun. because its default is toggle and i ♥♥♥♥ing hate toggle run and crouch, i know that's my preferance but it's two thousand and ♥♥♥♥ing sixteen and every game should give you the option to either toggle or hold.  Also: The game is a piece of ♥♥♥♥. stealth is an option but it is impossible to accomplish because enemies are at every single turn and very weirdly placed, for example: i tried sneaking into an enemy base and halfway through a bunch of my own guys spawned INSIDE the base and i literally saw them spawn on the minimap, compeltly ♥♥♥♥ing that up. The game also feels very 'far cry' ish. Oh and don't forget the magical blimp that spawns enemies 'immersevly' 10m's away. And i feel like there is some hidden mouse acceleration or smoothing going on which always annoys the ♥♥♥♥ out of me. You don't even get to shoot anyone until about 30mins in. this especially looks bad comapared to doom, wherein it took a total of 15 seconds. i mean i know its got a story but for ♥♥♥♥ sake at least but a little something to whet my appetite.   Overall i would NOT recommend this game. Wait for a sale and wait until its fixed cause it feels like a total cash-in. The graphics are all right and it worked pretty well on my gtx 970 but yeah thats about the only positive...
3143	1	a	I dont usually write reviews, but just wanted to say it runs perfectly fine on my rig, the only time i ever get any sort of slow down is right after I open the store page or capture a point. This doesnt effect the game play at all so it doesnt bother me. Just wanted to put my two cents in here because I want people to know it does run fine on some rigs without a bunch of glitches. Ive enjoyed the five hours I have put in so far, and plan on putting alot more time in. My recomendation would be to buy it, and if it runs fine on your rig great, if not return it. But its definitly worth giving it a shot.
3145	1	a	good game. greeat graphics most of the time. A few glitches but sure a couple of patches will fix them.
1413	0	a	The Game is Bugged bad can't even get passed the first mission you jump on the van go to jump through the window and you cant it is like you get stuck in the wall such a huge disapointment.
1414	0	a	Decision time: play a bit more to see if things get better, or stop playing so my refund window doesn't close. Easy decision. Only took an hour.  Given that a large chunk (or maybe all - idk) of the first hour of the single player game mostly consists of cutscene-like  things , I jumped into the co-op mode with two friends. That's what I bought the game for anyway. We were treated to downgraded visuals, silly clipping issues, and absurd NPC behavior (call it Artificial Unintelligence). It was not fun, not even in the ironic sense where bad game design can be unintentionally hilarious. It just sucked - in an entirely bland and tedious way.  Homefront: the Revolution isn't ready. For anything. It's the Aliens: Colonial Marines of 2016. In honor of the 16th anniversary of Old Man Murray's 'Time-to-Crate' review system, I'll grade HtR on a scale of 'Time-to-Refund,' and give it a score of 20 minutes (the time I spent in the co-op). I think that's like a 17 out of a possible 100, if 100 represents the two-hour refund window, or something. Who cares.  Save your 60 bucks for something else, like a vacation to Detroit. I hear it's nice this time of year.
3147	1	a	So Im not one to ever write a reviwe, I felt this game, despite its bugs and quirks, is one of the better well writen games Ive played in a long time. At the time of writing this the game has not been patched for preformance or some of the bugs, hell the frist time I started the game I had no video, just a black screen with audio. While this was discouraging the game play mechanics and over all writing of the story keep me going.  Id recommend this game, although you may want to wait for the patch they say will be coming soon, and keep in mind this game has nothing to do wtih that god alfaw frist homefront game other than the north koreans invade.
1416	0	a	Soup Kitchen: The Ruination
1417	0	a	f..K THIS GAME.  i bought this game and i started it up and it wont let me play.  dont buy this ♥♥♥♥ game, they just want you money and disappear  
3149	1	a	**ATTENTION**    This game is by far my favorite shooter of the year. I see a lot of bad reviews on this game, but that's because half of them are AMD users and they complain about everything not working. Oh please enjoy the game for what it is. It isn't bad at all, well made game. The story line already is catching my attention a lot, i'm just looking forward to beating it already and more of the DLC to come out. A few patched need to be done but it runs smooth as Donald Trump's election speeches (JOKES). I definitely recommend getting the game, the sound quality and environmental textures are well defined.  P.S.   AMD users get good please. Stop complaining.   Love  Nad
3151	1	a	Not the best game ever made but definately not deserving of all the negative rants. GFX are great it runs well on my mid range rig. Weapon choice is limited and the story is indeed a bit dull but you get to shoot a f*ckton of koreans in the face, so props for that. Also not seen any of those countless bugs people are raving about. Sure an npc can block a doorway sometimes but you can also shoot said npc.  Not worth 60€ but if you get it on ♥♥♥ or instant gaming for half that it's well worth buying.
1422	0	a	worst game i have ever played
3153	1	a	Looks like Watch_Dogs in first person so really great &lt;3
1423	0	a	You get to kill norks and throw phones 10/10  edit:  Thats about all I can do please fix this game 1/10
3155	1	a	This is a great game with a good story plot, the gameplay is that of a far cry type which makes it very enjoyable ,The weapons customisation is amazing some of the best i have seen . This is a open world with zones it's not just one big open area which is not a bad thing at all ! ............ I would recommend is game ! ( 8.0 out of 10)  
3157	1	a	If you like Farcry, you will like this.
1424	0	a	Can not recommend this game in its current state, fps are all over the place major studdering/freezing.  If this game is using the Cryengine that they used to make ryse then they are dong something really really wrong cause these graphics look like the game Condemned from 2006 lol.  Might be worth a buy after some major fixing, woyld not pay more than $20 for it though.
3159	1	a	TL;DR This is an OK game. You would think that mixing Crysis2 and Farcry3/4 would give you something stellar, but the game is held back by technical aspects. I am think that if the game gets some patch love this game would be worth 60 bucks. At launch though its worth 40 bucks IMO. 15 hours if joe blow plays, maybe 25 if you 100%. No NG+. Farcry3/4 with a 'face lift' and no fetch quests.  I have two 780's, this game doesn't run SLI. This seems to be par for the course however, SLI support has sucked for the past year. I have to run this game at low settings to get this to run at 60fps on my 2560x1080 monitor. This game runs like cold molasses, uphill, in january, on pluto. When I did have my settings jack way up the game did look fairly nice, but it seems like you need a 9xx or R9 3xx card in order to play it like that. There was also quite a bit of popin when I was playing, I'd like to say thats due to my low settings, but this being a console port leaves me wondering.  I have heard that there are a number of glitches, I encountered maybe 2 that required a 'restart from checkpoint' both were doors not opening. All the other glitches I saw were few and far inbetween, and also resulted in a chuckle. Nothing game breaking was encountered but buyer beware, others have had issues.   'Trigger warning: I played ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ easy mode' Gunplay is fairly diverse and enjoyable. There is a usable cover fire system, but it only allows fire from chest high walls, no corner shooting. I found myself switching between the whole selection of guns though my game. Though there are only 6 guns, they have 3 modes. Meaning you are always equiped for any situation. Some modes are worth more than others however, battle rifle outclasses the sniper, auto/pump shotties are better than blunderbuss, etc. I found myself using all of them at least once however. The upgrade system leaves something to be desired however. After beating the game I had only upgraded 6 of my 18 guns. This can be done if you play this game like a Just Cause achievement hunter, but joe blow will likely upgrade the 4 modes he likes the most and get the the end before other upgrades happen. Gun attachments feel like crysis, so theres that. Also, not taking guns from the baddies.  Stealth. Its in the game? Don't get seen, use suppressor(pistol only)/crossbow, get lucky and kill the guy shooting at you without tripping the alarm, hide like its asscreed. The game tries to come down like a ton of bricks if you are seen, but the generous hiding spots negate this quickly. Honestly if you want Stealth play the riddick games. This has servicable stealth.   I got into multiplayer once, it seems to be CO-OP only and my game musta had a 700 ping. Good concept though, lets hope there are players for lobbies, as you need 2 to start.  Over all, ignoring my having to play at low settings its a good game. 60 bucks? ehhhh, if you and a few buddies like to play online sure. Campaign is 30-40 bucks, none of the characters are noteworthy or memorable. The worst one does kill themself so thats a plus, even if it is in the name of freedom.
3161	1	a	Im not having any issues. love the game sofar
3163	1	a	Have no issues with framerate, only a few lag spikes every 10 min or so. Game Looks pretty good.
3165	1	a	Got trapped in a corner by npc women, calls me an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, real life simulator
1427	0	a	  this is the worst game ever played in my entire gaming career. it sucks and don't ever think about trying it. i m actually pukeing right now, just a sec.
1428	0	a	They wrecked a good game by making it open world. Simple as that.
3167	1	a	Needs optimisation, and some keys cant be rebound like X for example which will do what it does by default and what you bind it to do, this for me means costomizing my weapon and crouching at the same time with X which is quite anoying !! Apart from that i am quite enjoying the game
3169	1	a	Have no issues with framerate, only a few lag spikes every 10 min or so. Game Looks pretty good.
3171	1	a	It's a good game with a few glitches and framrate issues that will hopefully be addressed soon. My only complaint is that the game seems a little short for my liking and I wish it's main story was longer and I did all of the optional objectives as well and I still feel this way.
1431	0	a	It's fun, it really is.  The graphics aren't that bad. Was really enjoying it.  Then it crashed.  Wait til some more patches come out, needs work before it's fully functional and then it'll be a decent buy.
1432	0	a	Bad performance across the board. FPS with lots of lag and stuttering. LOW FOV. cant go above 65 verticle. even when using a user.cfg the game ignores CL_fov above 65.  I'm getting a refund.
1433	0	a	Not worth $59.99
1434	0	a	Uninstall :D
3173	1	a	I bought this game for the sole purpose of playing a CRYENGINE based co-op title that isn't free-to-play.  For me the game certainly delivers what I was hoping for being hands down the best looking co-op game I have played so far.  IMO it technically wipes the floor with most of the other recently released titles in terms of realtime calculated graphical output and fidelity. From the shading of the effects, over to the filtering of the shadows, down to the way that huge co-op suburban area is being spammed with omnidirectional shadowcasting pointlights (down to the 'glow-sticks' that also cast shadows).   When running this game maxed out on Ultra settings, it is a pleasure to look at (even bullet tracers from Players and AI are lighting up the environments).  To me this game looks better clientside in co-op mode than most other titles in Singleplayer and I totally don't get why it gets so much hate for the visuals while other mediocre looking games get praised for theirs...  Dambuster Studios &amp; Deep Silver: Whatever you plan for future updates for this game... DON'T DOWNGRADE THE VISUALS of the game on maxed-out settings !!!  People should stop expecting major graphical progress in PC Gaming without having to invest into new hardware, providing the required horsepower to render those new next-gen environments.  I am enjoying the short and varied Co-op missions using the .50 caliber Sniper Rifle most of the time.  The netcode feels smooth and responsive.  Upgrading your character's skills, weapons and outfits feels fun.  I haven't touched the Singleplayer Campaign yet but the Co-op part translates to an '90 out of 100' for me.  Here some of my gameplay footage on which this review is grounded:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKJgUuZO6nM 
3175	1	a	OMG How can i say this simple and short? one word AMAZING!
3177	1	a	Most of the early comments being so negative were unjustified, dont know what happened there. There have been ALOT of games that came out in a much worse state that didnt receive this kind of flak.  That being said, it does need some polish, there are technical imperfections and all that.  But they havent really bothered me in the slightest, im actually enjoying the open world vibe alot ! The shooting is nice, it looks great, the vibe of revolution is there and i just like how the kpa guys look and their high tech stuff feels like a threat.  UPDATE: the patch adresses non issues for me, i notice the slight stutter but i only experience them at the shops. I would much rather see some stronghold fixes, two of them are bugged out in my game and cannot be captured.  The AI issues people have spammed the discussion boards with are out of proportion, yes, there is silly behaviour... propaganda trucks trying to drive up a trashpile into a wall etc, but in al honesty i have not seen this alot. Maybe it doesnt catch my attention like it did in fallout 3 and 4.  Also, i am enjoying this game quite alot, the score it received is absolute nonsense. It should be around 75 imo (still not finished with it). Theres alot more to do and atmosphere than most triple A shooters, it even runs WAY (WAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYY) better for me on high/highest settings than far cry 4 which i had to run on medium settings to be able to shoot something.
1441	0	a	very sad...a beautifull game world is ruined by gameplay that feels like wading through syrup the nonsprint walk speed is similar to call of duty modern warfare when you are wandering around after the nuke goes off and you get knocked out and saved TWICE over 2 different longer then needed cutscenes before the game lets you even begin to play  a thumbs down is not good enough somebody needs to throw poo at these people
1442	0	a	oh my god... ♥♥♥♥♥iest game i have ever played like wtf... running the game at a constant 20 fps even though my pc is wayy higher than the minimum specs. overall the game's optimization is complete trash don't waste your 60$ on this (btw was running the game at the LOWEST specs)
3179	1	a	I love the game but LOTS OF BUGS!!!! Every few seconds the game freezes and then in like a second its fine bu does this the entire time your playing the game. I know its not the PC because my brother has the game on the PS4 and it does the same thing... Once this is fixed the game will be even better. I under stand the game came out a week ago but still you have enough time to fix these bugs in the game. Please FIX THIS!!!!!
3181	1	a	Having played the first Homefront on PC, I had to get this one before its launch. I must say the open world game play is amazing you can recruit resistant fighters to fight with you in the battle to reclaim the fallen America from the clutches of the Korean Agressors. weapons can customised to your fighting needs. Taking over strongholds would help the resistant side immensly in the war for Aamerica. This is one action packed game you must own. It is very addictive and cutting edge. The first game was more story driven whereas this game focuses more on the open world fighting aspect.  I still have a fair way to go with this game. If you love taking down the oppressor, But love Samsung phones. This is the game to get.  The scary reality is that the North Korean war could happen in the distant future. What you see in the news today is a scary reality. It could happen to us in real life.  We must stand up for what we believe in and to always KEEP ON FIGHTING.   10/10 MUST HAVE ON PC.
3183	1	a	From a technical standpoint I can admit it does have some little glitches but I have not personally experieced anything game breaking. The single player campaign is ok as long as you run it in short sprints but I actually am liking the co-op mission especially if you have a full group. They are fast and quick and none seem to drag out and overstay their welcome.
3185	1	a	i waiting for this game but its not what i expected the graphic was too high that i can even play this on 30 fps. And the story a little bit short its like the first homefront after you finish it you done and star a new game  Its a great game but dont buy it for now, buy it after they fix about the fps drop
3187	1	a	Good game but there are some bad and annoying things about it such as animations freaking out sometimes and getting stuck in weird places
3189	1	a	Don't get why people keep destroying games that's come out after milions problem while in develop. Wtf did you expect?  Anyway, the game is funny, it's not CoD style 'go in kill everything' you will be forced to destroy something important than RUN AWAY before something bigger come to kick your rebel ♥♥♥. That's how revolution work.  It has tech problems, however i'm having fun while playing it.   Search some cd keys around and it will be worth the price  
1443	0	a	first of all, I don't like to play the bad guys.   The story of the game is so horrible, the USA are importing weapons, with backdoors installed, from Best Korea and then they are wondering how all of this could happend. In the whole time you are playing as a terrorist, sabotaging the KPA(the army of  BEST  Korea), murdering innocent police officers, terrorizing the population and a lot more what terrorist tend to do.  The AI is so stupid, you are in front of a guard with weapons equipped and he won't notice you, oh boy the KPA is really accpeting the American tradition of wearing weapons in public. As a terrorist, of course, you only have limited range of weapons, for example only one handgun is available in the whole game. 
3191	1	a	Good game but there are some bad and annoying things about it such as animations freaking out sometimes and getting stuck in weird places
3193	1	a	Just finished the game, took me 19 hours to complete with 100% on all zones.   I personally enjoyed the story and £40 well spent.
1444	0	a	If you wanted to get this to play with you friends then dont, it just doesnt work and you dont get to explore the world with them or even play the story, the AI run into walls and wont even back up to go around. This is more upsetting then the Divison just found out how bad that game was when it was to late
1445	0	a	It's ♥♥♥♥! The story, the gameplay, the shooting, the looting, the trading and the A.I.
3195	1	a	Nice graphics, nice animations, stupid AI (like really stupid). This just confirms what people already said. Devs seem to be busy with purchasable contents, so the minor bugs such as getting stuck nearly everytime you try to jump off a building are most likely not getting fixed anytime soon. Singleplayer story mode is quite fun, but after 2 hours playing it becomes pretty dull. Multiplayer is poor and dead - 6 different missions, 5 types of upgradable weapons, loads of wearable gear pieces and an extraordinarily long waiting time. It's not one of the games you can play all day, but also it's not completely boring. The setting is actually really cool though.  Conclusion: If you aren't a hard to please player, which means you don't mind pig-brained Koreans standing against you and Americans with the intelligence equivalent on your side, you might enjoy this game just as I do. If you make enough money, go ahead, get it and have fun, but it's not the game you'd want to spend your last 50€ on. But yeah, I like it.
3197	1	a	Good game just need some time to update. I am a hardcore gamer so guys if you look at the other reviews dont listen to them the game needs some time and feed back so if you continue making bad reviews to the game they wont update it so if you have bought the game and gives it bad review it won be better and as I said give the game some time to progress
3199	1	a	In my honest opinion the game played out very well even with a few of the ai pathing problems although I do feel there could have been much more done with the game due to the lack in purchasable gear i.e. backpack upgrades and such I think some more armor choices would have been good. Although the game plays out very well I believe there were a lot of problems story wise and the killing of characters that could have been a key player in future instalments of the story, but that being said all in all it was a very fun game and I would easily wish to play future versions if they are like this.  ps. the faces look abit outdated lol
1448	0	a	No, no, no and definitely no. Don't even bother, I can't imagine someone thought people will like 'this'. Has no feel to it, completely generic rip off. Intros you can't skip and a number of issue right at the start.
1449	0	a	No, no, no and definitely no. Don't even bother, I can't imagine someone thought people will like 'this'. Has no feel to it, completely generic rip off. Intros you can't skip and a number of issue right at the start.
1450	0	a	Absolutely everything wrong with modern games. Too much cinematics. Didn't make it past the first APEX Secure Gateway. Why? Because I moved the mouse as suggested and nothing happened. Clicked right mouse, left mouse, scrolled, and pressed every button on my keyboard and absolutely nothing happened. Typical of modern games. Useless mechanics. USELESS USELESS USELESS USELESS
1451	0	a	Based on 2 hours of gameplay, this games needs a makeover, badly. Optimization expecially. not worth what I paid
1452	0	a	Only got this because im from philly and thats really the only selling point for this whole game.
3201	1	a	I just finished Homefront: The Revolution and wow what an amazing game it was.  I dont understand these reviews saying that they have high end pc's with Titan X and dual 980 with i7 and they cant run the game properly. I have a 970 Strix and a i5 and i had smooth 60fps in ultra settings all the way. The Npc's also seemed fairly aware and not 'stupid' as some might say, for the dificulty i was playing in.  Overall i really enjoyed this game and i recommend you ignore the stupid steam reviews that say the had performance issues (i dont know if youve noticed but everybody has a 2000/3000$ computer on the internet).  If you like Far Cry then you should totally buy this one, the gameplay is almost the same and the story is really good. The overall atmosphere of the game is also great, it makes you really feel like part of a gerilla especially on the later zones where you have to sneak away from guards, etc, and sabotage various things so you can take advantage of them against the enemy. 9/10- A really good time.
1456	0	a	Oh god, where to start.  Poorly optomized, rushed, AI is mess, spawning is dumb, looting is pointless when you can just grind missions and get a ridiclous amount of money, unrealistic gun fights.  TLDR: The devs rushed the game, it's bad.  Requested a refund.
1457	0	a	I dont do alot of reviews but this game seems broken, online is only as good as the host and people skip all over, the visuals remind me of a bad B movie were they try to save money by making everything dark so you are focused on the action so you dont look at how poor everthing looks, 1080i looks like 640/480(grainey) and its not smooth at all, its very jerky you lag in and out of scope. The origional Homefront I think actually looked better. That being said I do believe its poorly optimized and can be fixed, it is playable but at this time a thumbs down, they should of had all this and multiplayer servers.  Update: I really tried to like this game, I really did but its the first and only steam game of 100's that i requested a refund.
3203	1	a	I was not expecting anything out of this game, never played any of its previous ones, I just got it because my friend was all hyped over it. TBPH This game is quite fun, I have only played the Co-op multiplayer, but it was all enjoyable, even though we only actually sucessfully completed a single mission after opening it up to pub and getting 2 more to help, after ~2 hours.  I think the 'performance issues' are Intel based, sell outs, my AMD FX 8350 and GTX 970 runs fine on near max settings (gotta lower that gdamn antialiasing) at ~70-80 fps, but yeah.  On a side Note: I never understood why people complain about the whole aiming mechanics in these types of games, either for or against bullet drop etc, I mean these games are NOT shooting simulators, if you would like the pinpoint accuracy and bullet drop or w/e of a shooting simulator, go play COD or CS:GO or some boring e-sport game like that.  Was it worth the money? I'd say yes. If you do not have someone to play with perhaps not.
3205	1	a	So after playing the game for a bit I have to admit i actuely really enjoy it. i have a mid tier gaming pc and i can run the game at high settings getting a constent 60 fps. The graphics are also stunning. make sure you download the drivers and your all set. i look forward to playing more!
3207	1	a	A lot of people's problems with this game are the optimisation and story, and to be honest, they aren't all that great. But if you can look past those, the graphics are nice-ish (with my system, I have to run it on minimal graphics, and even then it isn't the worst), the animations in my opinion are actually really good and the gunplay seems fairly solid, especially the heavy sniper.   Another part of the game I really enjoy is the stealth. I've seen a few reviews where they give it ♥♥♥♥ but to me it seems like the AI are smart enough to track you down and at the same time, not being super-cosmic Ethan Brady sensing Norks. The takedowns are fun and actually pretty brutal, but to be honest, a little more detail (blood/gore) wouldn't have been bad.   The idea that you are guerilla fighters is really embedded through the fact that you are definitely not invincible. The hit and run style of fighting is almost your only option in the first 3 areas of Philly, until you gear up a little more.   All up I would say pick this game up when it's a little cheaper maybe, but if you can snag it on sale then you will absolutely enjoy yourself.
3209	1	a	Have to say playing it for 10 hours it;s not that Bad what thoes Trolls make it out to be, Yes the fram rate is not that great But who cares its a fun game . Great Job DEPP SILVER
1460	0	a	the game came out with a delay of 1h  and when he did he was buged  i hope they will fix the lag one day but in the meanwhile i am refunding
3211	1	a	Have to say playing it for 10 hours it;s not that Bad what thoes Trolls make it out to be, Yes the fram rate is not that great But who cares its a fun game . Great Job DEPP SILVER
1463	0	a	Weirdly racist. 
1464	0	a	why does this game exsist because it sucks
3213	1	a	The world is very immersive. That is all really...   The only thing in my opinion holding this game back is depth. Its like everything they did was only 50%... they decided to go with quantity over quality.  Although this game has its flaws(which is many) I couldnt keep myself away from it. The world was believable all the way until the final sequence. The story is cool, but I think the way they decided to engage it was a mistep. This game would've been better without the 'open world' mechanics. they could have invested more in a deeper rich story through linear well thought out levels.  At one point the game gives you a decision to kill someone or let them live. This game could've done so much more with real decision making mechanics to effect the outcome.   Things get repetative. You do the same thing in every district to further branch the story which was just annoying. On top of that it feels like you... just you... are the revolution. Most of the time you'll be doing things alone, even when there is all out anarchy and everyone is running around shooting the KPA you'll be lonewolfing through the mission. You can recruit 2 resistance members but they are kind of useless and sometimes end up walking into your bullets.  The thing they got right with this game though is the mood. Everything is a wreck, it really feels and looks like America went to ♥♥♥♥ when you walk throughout these areas. The devs really outdid themselves with the level design. The level at the pier with the two aircraft carriers just rusting away was one of the coolest things ive seen in a video game.
3215	1	a	I havent had a lot of time to play it yet but If your looking for one of those boring all Multiplayer games this isnt for you.  if you want a old style have fun single player then its great.   dont know why people are having problems with this game. I haveyet to encounter any problems and its just like Batman and other gasmes.. get a good pc 
1466	0	a	its buggy as hell missions veary form 1 that easy and the next one impossible and it crashes every 30 min or so
1467	0	a	Played literally 0.4 hours - instant refund.
1468	0	a	This game runs my cpu up to 70 degrees Celsius. Qt.
1469	0	a	Boooooooring gamplay,Mission and everything. Just amazing cutscene
1470	0	a	quality just sucks : bad game perfomance on mddle power laptop, a lot of bugs in game. but main line is cool
1471	0	a	I cant play this dumb game because the whole screen is black i just fixed the black screen and i am editing this the review.But now it is laggy now after the black screen went away and the whole game overall is not good right now i hope they have an update to help with the fps problem :).
3217	1	a	it ok comrade boi approves
1472	0	a	  1. thiss great game ,like story or screen , its amazing . 2.i had adjust all settings but only had 36 fps upon . 3. no one online game with me ,theres no server man
1473	0	a	Plain. Simple. Pale. Lame.  A $30 max game sold as an AAA one.
3219	1	a	I waited a long time for this game, and i was very disappointed with it. However i would still recommend you make your own decision instead of reading someone else's self proclaimed review. I recommend this game but with caution in mind, remember you have only 2 hours to refund if you truly don't like it. If the price had been 39- 49.99 i would have probably kept it. 66.49 really? Developers are getting greedier even with digital downloads, as if they sent me a CD to justify the extra cost.
1474	0	a	This game is a jerky ugly mess. FOV max of 65 gives me a headache, I cant get it to run with any kind of smoothness, even with everything dropped to Low. The controls feel floaty like mouse smoothing is on but I can't find a setting for that.  Complete buyers remorse inside 30 minutes, I'm impressed. 
3221	1	a	Housefart the raviloi is a game where America skips rent on the Korean ipads so Korea moves into America and people with blue clothes on fight for their right to party. Then kevin spacey is a bad guy and the automatic paper airplanes die at the end when you DDOS them and you have to choose to save your son or nuke Boston.
1475	0	a	I was honestly very excited to play this game. I guess I just fell into the hype for it. I have a PC that is way better than the recommended requirements, and still I dip to 20FPS even on the Low setting. I wouldn't recommend to buy this game till either it's on sale or until you know for sure that the game is safe to play. 1/10 wouldn't recommend...
3223	1	a	Great story and gameplay. 10/10 would play more Homefront games. 
1476	0	a	I can't belive I'm saying this but I almost prefer the first game...
3225	1	a	Leave all the hatered behind the only flaw with this game is that it is not well optimised for anything nor pc nor ps4 but leaving that behind this is a all new game with new kind of vibe to it which we dont get in fps now a days the main campaign is good and the stealth and the open world element gives it a whole new touch and the gun play is too good although i get 30-40 fps it bothers me sometimes but if the patches can optimize the game then this could be one outstanding shooter. go ahead try it if you are into shooters and have a decent pc.
3227	1	a	This is exactly what Homefront should've been, however there are some weird stuff with the game  - Playing the game on Recruit difficulty is still a challenge, I don't get it that you die so easily - North Koreans depicited here are weird looking almost cyborgs like - On the PC version the frame rate drops aren't constant, while on the consoles the game runs at 15-30 fps - There just isn't so much stuff to do and the game becomes abit of a chore rather than fun  But still it's worth to checkout if you like alternate history games :)  It's a 6/10 for me, could've been better if they'd let it be in development more time :(
1478	0	a	ITS TASH
3229	1	a	I find the other reviews drastically over dramatic towards the game and honestly i am perfectly fine with it since i am not choosing an side to both good or bad sides of people's opinions.  My honest opinion i find the game quite entertaining with the objectives and some how the stealth in the game in yellow and green zones to wake up a uprising! but i have to behonest the preformance is bad, the A.I. and so on... and we all know that! But dont you think the devs would know aswel after hearing the crying and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥tting of other ♥♥♥♥ reviewers? yes, of course they did, and if you use some common sence they of course would go and fix it, they are obvious issues to the game preventing gameplay. I think people should just be patient and just ♥♥♥♥ing wait xP With the other ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t aside from cry baby's like Jim Sterling, i find the game entertaining, only issues i've had was the freezing issue and the A.I. apart from that i looked past it and enjoyed the game to the fullest, i would say a 8/10. I would recommend it when the updates and patches are made for the main issues to the game so you can enjoy it! aside that, i hope you all had a nice time! c:
3231	1	a	Wish there was more. But honestly great story line in my opinion Sucks that i cant continues after the finall mission
1481	0	a	Was game.
1482	0	a	All I see is a black screen. I only managed to get to the menu screen once. (i7-6700k, RX480 8GB, Win10)
3233	1	a	in my opinion, i think this game is my favorite game of 2016 so far. The graphics may not be amazing, but are still good to me.            i'd give it a 7.5/10 because of some frame drops and freezing for 2-4 seconds, there are some clichés in the story, and i feel that there isn't much content (for this type of game). I suggest that the devolopers should add some more weapons and a bigger map full of more stuff in the sequel (if their is one.)
3235	1	a	Good game! So far into the game I like the gameplay, atmosphere, and concept. After adjusting the setting to the GeForce Experience recommended setting, which basically recommended me the lowest settings the game floats well and the graphics is still beautiful on my seasoned gaming laptop (Intel Core i7-4700MQ with GTX765M).  The story is credible enough, taking into account alternative history setting. Some glitches here and there, that are likely fixable with patches. Gameplay works well as soon you get used to it. This is a game you must play on the premises of the game. It is not a pure stealth game, and not a pure kill’em-all game, but something in-between. Get used to that and it is fun.  Since there are so many bad reviews I feel I must defend myself, so I will do. If you want DOOM, get DOOM. If you want COD, get COD. If you want The Division, get The Division. They are probably better if those are the game you really want. This game requires something else from you, namely to play as an inferior guerilla soldier in hostile environment with superior power enemies. Tactics are required.   For me this game seems like a perfect warm up to Deus Ex: Mankind Divided and Dishonored 2. Give it a chance if you share my motivation.  
3237	1	a	Game runs smooth and handles like any far cry game you've played. Fov doesn't go higher than 65 , but that doesn't appear to be a problem as of yet, i'm sure there will be a hack or work around in a few days. As for running under 60fps, the game does dip if you are running on ultra settings. I set mine to high settings and it's been running butter smooth. Must be all those intel/nvidia scrubs, AMD MASTER RACE ftw! Visually the game is beautiful with a very intricate urban environment. Looking forward to completing this game.

3241	1	a	I don't often write reviews but I feel the need with this game. I also don't often pre-order games but I was super stoked for Homefront: The Revolution. It didn't dissapoint. I am in love with this game and as someone who rarely finds playing games multiple times is worth while this game I promise you I will beat repeatedly. I already beat it once. Took me 29 hours to do on hardened/normal. There is repeatability there. I rushed through the first time to get the story but the second time I will take the time to explore everything, find everything, and do all of the side missions. The game is challenging at times and easy at times. Sometimes you feel out of control and sometimes you feel completely in control. It has a beautiful balance between open world and story. The plot twists are well done. I do have to say one of my favorite parts though is the fact that you can see the effect you are having on the population. Your actions change the demeaner of the citizens in step by step progressions as you do more to encourage them. The Red Zones are run and gun where as the yellow zones are are more Assassins Creedish with a soldierly spin. Lets just say this game grabbed me, sucked me in, and I thought about it constantly when I wasn't playing. Honestly in my opinion anybody complaining about this game should have known not to buy it before it came out. They produced the game they promised and if you pre-order a game you should expect bugs. I had less then I expected. Although I will say at the moment I have not played multiplayer for I am unable to. I keep getting an error code.

3247	1	a	Bought the game to shoot and stab koreans.
1501	0	a	Homefront: The Revolution of boring
3249	1	a	Amazing! The controls are flawless, and very seemless. I also love how you can make weapons in the field, and not have to go to a bench. The option where you can turn your pistol into an SMG is great. I strongly recommend this game!
1503	0	a	s@h&amp;i%T game, su@c%k handing and hud. i cant refund because the game didnt close though i push the 'quit'
1504	0	a	Wow, it's like time traveling to the 90's and playing those old arcadey shooters. Forget physics, sense, ambience. This game would call duke nukem 3d an update. Gliding above surfaces is so reminiscent of old gameplay, and knowing where, what and how to do something is really not necessary for a game where you have to achieve something. Tells ya what, grab them bills, tie 'em to your dog's balls and let him lick the bills to oblivion instead of buying this game.
1505	0	a	It is not bad the gameplay is solid but with the FPS drops in certin areas i cant recomend it right now. also has that annoying glitch that fallout 4 has where if you move across the map too quick the textures look like mud when it should look like steel.
1506	0	a	Just simply awful.
1507	0	a	Hi. I just got done playing this game with my good friend Tucker Boner. We knew it was ♥♥♥♥ and it still shocked us just how bad it truly is. I would rather take a pinecone and shove it down my throat while a Unicorn shoves his horn in my ♥♥♥♥.   Never make a game again.  11/10 - Skyrim with Guns
1508	0	a	nothing for me!
3251	1	a	Highly recommend this game. It has some flaws but can be fixable in the future updates. The game makes you feel like you are an actual american taliban fighting against the north koreans, out numbered, outgunned and hopeless. This game is a 9.5/10 for me. I would recommend buying it. And the visuals are really good too.
1510	0	a	Other then the graphics looking good worst game ever played runs horrible and doesnt even have multiplayer like the first homefront did a big downgrade from the orginial
3253	1	a	Heres how my game experience went once it came out:  -Downloads game  -Waits in anticipation.  -Starts game.  -Gets frustrated with so many cutscenes.  -Pulls out phone.  -Nopes off game.  -Returns game.  -The end.  1/10 IGN
1511	0	a	First let me give you a little background on my gaming so you dont think this is coming from some schmuck! I have been a gamer for over 35 years starting with Atari and the commodore 64. I have been playing FPS since the original call of duty. So here goes! The designers and producers of this game are either drunk or so far out of touch with what gamers are looking for in FPS that they should 1) stop producing games 2) refund the purchase price to everyone who purchased this game as a noob so they dont think this is what FPS should be and 3) apologize for ruining the Homefront title which was a great FPS game. This game is terrible from the story line to the gameplay. This is the worst multiplayer game I have ever encountered. To call this multiplayer or even co-op is a joke. My advise to anyone looking to purchase a good FPS is to buy anything other than this fiasco of a game. Developers and producers as well as graphic design should all be embarssed for putting out such a monstrosity of a game. Steam should pull they game so they are not associated with such garbage.
1512	0	a	'Time to refund' 21 minutes boys &amp; girls  Another Pile of $hit release. Made me value the division that much more, and I hate that game!  
3255	1	a	Could have been a good game, but at very best a meh
3257	1	a	its a good game
1518	0	a	ahahahha can't believe this ♥♥♥♥ was actually released... everything about it is just terrible
1519	0	a	Gday  I managed to play Homefront The Revolution  during a steam FREE weekend, like most multi  plat (consoles + PC) titles this game is hyped  I would put this on top 10 WORST PC games of 2016 list. I cant belive people would pay  USD$23 let alone USD$40 for this rubbish  I attempted to play this coop with a friend after it took me over 12 hours to dl it on  Australia's great broadband :-   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSh3VAoDJko   Do yourself a favour and check out instead:- Arma 3  Insurgency 2 or Insurgency 3 Sandstorm (2017) hell Rainbow Six Siege with its watered down casual  crap is a better game   If you want a fun single player game go play HL2 or the free Transmissions: Element 120 on steam   http://   store.steampowered.com/app/365300/    Homefront The Revolution clearly demonstrates  the state of AAA multi plat games and no matter how frak1ng ♥♥♥♥ a title is , console peasants will  pre order and lub it to hell
1520	0	a	NOT WHAT I EXPECTED!
3259	1	a	I have a Radeon 7870 and an i5 4670 and my game is running very smoothly on MEDIUM.  I think many are upset that it's hard to get 60 FPS, but I figure that's because we've been spoiled.  As for the gameplay, I couldn't tell yet. So far the story seems compelling and the gameplay seems okay. Will update in the future with more gameplay. For now -- the game functions properly except for the few people complaining about 60 fps and all that jazz.
3261	1	a	I locw this game no matter what
3263	1	a	  Very Good
3265	1	a	Played for 30 minutes on my Core i7 Skylake and GTX 980ti. Have not encountered ANY lag or FPS issues, everything has been smoth.   Are people not upgrading their graphics driver? The latest Nvidia driver is 365.19.   So far my playthru has been fun and I have not noticed any glitches that would interfere with performance or my playthru. So if people are having problems then make sure you meet the recommended specifications from the store page.   Continuing on my review the story of how North Korea came to take over the USA is laughable but hey its a game!   For what this game is I have played much worse games than this but Homefront so far has been very enjoyable and will be part of the revolution and take out some NORKS.
3267	1	a	I have been waiting for a sequal to the original game for quite some time. The original didnt make a huge splash but there are a lot of us who still enjoyed it. This game feels a lot like the origial in my short time playing so in that respect I am happy. It is a little buggy but most games are on day 1, and its not anything a quick patch wont fix. I like it so its getting a thumbs up from me, if you dont like it so far why dont you give them a week to work out the cinks before you mindlessly hop on the hate train.
1534	0	a	Pro Tips from someone with 25 hours:  1: Don't buy it 2: Just play Crisis or Metro 2033. It's partly the same developer and so much better in almost every way. 3: Just Leave this store page and forget 4: Why are you still here? 5: Leave 6: Message to entice you to keep reading 7: LEAVE
1535	0	a	This literally the worst game I have ever played. It's so bad i couldn't play the first mission. F*ck these developers and f*ck this game.
3269	1	a	In for the achivements, got 10 in first 10 min.
3271	1	a	This is a video game.
3273	1	a	I picked it up after all the patches and I enjoyed it very much. The world is split up into sectors and essentially every sector is an 'open world'. You normally start in a section and the North Koreans (what a stupid storyline though) control the sector. You move through the map and take over key buildings, doing flash missions, finding hideouts with loot and ammo, jumping around on rooftops until you finally own most of the section, or at least enough to get to the next part of the story.  Then you move onto the next sections and repeat. I liked it because when you own an entire section you basically run around with impunity and your guns out blazing. When you go into a new sector there are now guys everywhere again so you have to revert back to a stealth mode and sneak around again until you build up more safe controlled areas. I love the style of game play, the weapons, just the storyline is really dumb (NK taking over the US through backdoors in tech).   However I say that and the voice acting and character subplots are fairly interesting which kept me engaged for most of the game. It was really fun and I revisit it every couple months now. Can't wait for this expansion.  btw I play 4K@45-60 FPS with an amd-8350 and nvidia 1070
3275	1	a	Cool game if you like apocalyptic style game.
3277	1	a	Just like far cry but in an urban area. nice visuals too
3279	1	a	Honestly the game wasn't that bad. the story seemd ok and the mission structure and all the around seems fine.  I refunded but only because i didn't had fun with this game. I don't know why, just wasn't really statisfied with this game.  I do recommend it to anyone willing to try it because you might just be the person that find this game fun.  gonna leave a positive review even though i refunded. I don't think this game is bad, i personnaly just didn't had fun playing it
1539	0	a	Uninspired gameplay and graphics that are on-par with other titles but don't stand out hamper my enjoyment Homefront: The Revolution. Unfortunately, it doesn't compensate by capitalizing on its somewhat novel story: America is now subject to rule by North Korea, and you are part of an insurgency fighting them. The game tries to pass off what you're doing and people's suffering, but just fails. I never felt involved with the characters. Attempts to portray Americans in the ghettos as oppressed fell flat, just the developers trying to inject emotion. The worst were the constant radio updates from resistance members that sounded just so chipper to go out scouting when they're supposed to be pariahs suffering at the hands of this dictatorship. Ugh, just the worst.
3281	1	a	I played this game during the FREE WEEKEND on steam.  Now the review. I went into this game excited as I've been watching this game ever since it was announced but was saddened by all the negative reviews. When there was a free weekend I was stoked and tried it out.  First off the graphics are very detailed and the lighting effects are amazing. Just the general atmoshpere is really immersive as you feel like you are living within an occupied city. The story seems a bit far fetched but hey its still a good game.  Secondly I will say that from the time I played it I realise why people were mad about the game as you do need a beefy computer in order to run it but they have released patches to make the game run smoother but since I do not have the game yet I do not know how big of a change this has had. Luckily my computer is beefy and ran the game very well.  So overall I enjoyed it but do admit the game was unoptimized at the time and a slightly beefy computer was required for this game. Once I buy the game I'll update my review to give a more complete review of it.
1540	0	a	great game except for the error code 132 which wont let me on and this is not the first time this has happened  sort this out please because this is just not acceptable i have payed for the game so expect to play it when i want and not repeatedly get this error which wont let me on private match or public match
3283	1	a	A bit cheesy and dodgy here and there but performance is solid, it looks fantastic and the gameplay is fun.  The DLC is good but awfully short at about 3h a piece, so unless you bought the season pass on sale don't bother.
3285	1	a	So I would like to update my review to this game. Originally I said i wouldnt suggest it to anyone. I totally would on steam sale lol. but also i think they mustve done some updating because the weapons sound alot better. The game has a better feel to it than it did. check it out. great graphics as well!
3287	1	a	Changed my review since patch 2.0 came out: + Graphics: Beautiful! I got impressed by the rain effects, the lightning on the rain as well as the rain hitting the ground. + Great atmosphere: It has a setting that would fit perfect into a Terminator movie. + Sound &amp; Music are both very good.  + Shooting works smoothly now + Developers that really did a great job in patching the game with great success, thanks!  I'm hoping/looking forward for a singleplayer dlc.
3289	1	a	My first review of this game wasnt very good. Performance was all over the place on patch 1.6 on my GTX 980 and i encountered a lot of bugs when playing on a different machine. Now after my upgrade to a GTX 1080 and the new 2.0 patch the performance isnt a big issue anymore on 1440p. Yeah there are sometimes still performance dips below 60 on certain locations but 90% of the time it is above 80 and feels smooth. There are still minor bugs to iron out, but the overall experience is good and im having fun with the game now. Thx for the great 2.0 patch!
3291	1	a	  Not a bad FPS and while I dont intend on buying it after the free weekend, I would recommend it if it stays in the 20 dollar price range as there seems to be plenty of content in the base game.  Gameplay-wise, it starts off a bit chaotic after the overly long opening scene with tons of radio chatter and calls for help lighting up the HUD so much, I would suggest disabling most of the prompts for not only immersion but also an enjoyable less intrusive experience.  The game looks great and there is no doubt an improvement from the 1st title and it also plays very smoothly on modest hardware so you should be able to find your system sweet spot with a tweak here and there.
3293	1	a	after pach 2.0 the game runs spectacular !
1542	0	a	Its a great Game Overall. There is just one MAJOR problem when I play and thats Im stuck on one base and It wont unlock the door for me. I toss all the hack tools I can get my hands on under a fence and it supposedly hacks the Box into opening the door, However The door will refuse to open. I cant break the door with bolt cutters either. GAME WAS TOO LAGGY
3295	1	a	While still a little bit broken, this is now a game worth your time if you enjoyed Far Cry 4 and are just looking for a little something more.
3297	1	a	  My score would be 7 out of 10. It could have been a great game, it's just a good game. It reminded me of Watch Dogs somehow, everyone was expecting a masterpiece and they got a good game.  All those bugs people were talking about were not in this latest release, so yeah, they fixed it. The major problem is the AI of the game, and that's because there is no AI. The enemies are dumb, its easy to past them without beeing noticed, and if you do, it's easy to escape. Combat is very good, thou. Weapons costumization is also great and it's a good story. It's a 16 hours or less game.
3299	1	a	I grabbed the game during the Steam free weekend, and after about 4 hours, decided to buy it with the discounted price, and in my opinion it's fully worth it. Certainly not worth the bad reputation, regardless of how bad it was at launch.  It's easily one of the best looking games out there at the moment. I especially love how they use dynamic lights a lot and night scenes are most of the time visually astonishing.  Story is average, gameplay is good, visuals are top notch and performance is very good. The world could be more reacting and persistent, and there are enemies that seem to appear from nowhere at times, but other than that, I don't have anything negative to say. There's also some kind of co-op, but I haven't tried that.  It's definitely worth the 24 euro price tag it has at the moment.  +Great atmosphere (audio and visuals) +Runs great +Looks beautiful +Solid gameplay -Alternate timeline premise is a bit silly -Lack of dynamic behaviour in the game world
3301	1	a	An inferior Far Cry styled game, buggy and a bit unoptimised, however has great graphics and enjoyable gameplay. For any Far Cry fan, this game is worth it when it even goes on a deep discount.
3303	1	a	GREAT GAME, first of all i have waited a few months now for the patches to kick in! but man the wait was totally worth it.i've heard of the game's glitches and bugs,etc... but at this state i can asure you it is amazingly fine and well balanced,the fps is also balanced no more game crashing bugs,the overall experience was worth it. HF:TR has everything a open world game need and it really lives upto the 'open world' genre,a decent story with bunch of decent characters like moon jesus she's crazy, however there were some cons to it like the weapon customization was very limited i mean VERY limited for each weapon and there was nothing exept kust bikes wich were all the same! jesus,u could at least add more variety to bikes right?! no color customization for anything not guns nor bikes,but the pros are more than the cons and beside the stuff i said, i really had a fun experience throught the game though i havnt yet finished it. i vote 7/10.
3305	1	a	  Not played a huge amount of the game, a little of the story and a little of the online and so far, I quite like it. Most likely going to buy it too.  Seeing a lot of hate for this game and I'm unsure why to be honest.  The headshot sound is ♥♥♥♥worthy! &lt;3
3307	1	a	  This game look like Far cay (Outpost), Crysis (Gun Custom), Rage (Resident Zone), and more. Recommend when it on sell.
1546	0	a	  the coop mode would be fun with 1-3 friends for about 5 € and the rest (graphic, gunplay, balancing) is absolute garbage (played it for 1 hour at free weekend)
1547	0	a	  Finished the single player during the free weekend, which for all the claims of being 'fixed' still suffered from several serious technical issues such as:  *Horrendous mouse input lag (200+ms) until I turned off supersampling (despite flawless frame rate thanks to my 1080GTX) *various GUI errors, keyboard prompts being replaced with joypad ones for no apparent reason for the duration of a mission *hard crash between missions that caused save corruption (clicking resume at the main menu after restarting the game did nothing, had to manually reload the previous autosave to continue)  Still, while the single player was mediocre at best at least I got through it.   Co-op on the other hand is completely broken right now. Cannot join a single game, so there is no reason to buy it after the free weekend ends.
3309	1	a	Checked it out for a bit during the free weekend so this will be more of a first impression instead of a review.   TLDR version: Overall seems like you could have a decent time with it but I'd wait for a 60%-75% discount before buying.    There seem to be a ton of things to do but just after around 1h of messing around in the first open area I could already feel the repetition in the core gameplay loop. It's just clear building, kill plebs, activate power switch, etc. The time sensitive 'flashpoint' missions that randomly pop up do add some variety but not sure if that's enough some 10+ hours into the game.   The shooting felt fairly average. Didn't have any real issues but I also could not feel any crazy impact when mowing down enemy troops. That may have something to do with early game unmoded weaps being kinda meh tho. Seems like there is some pretty deep weapon customization so shooting may be a lot more fun later down the line.  The silent protag constantly getting talked at by every pleb he meets is fairly detrimental to the story as far as I'm concerned. Can't say much more about it since I only did the first few missions tho.   Didn't see any of the bugs people keep posting about but that may be later in the game. For me it was a completely smooth experience.   Overall I really don't know why this is rated 'mostly negative' on Steam. It's not a top of the line shooter but you can still have quite a bit of fun here. Will probably buy it after the next price drop.  
1548	0	a	  --- TL;DR SUMMARY--- PROS: - Nice open world design - Good graphics - Variety of guns - Good ideas for a game...  CONS: - ...Good ideas that go poorly executed. - Mute player character - Flat characters and near meaningless interaction - Story that doesn't deliver. - 4 hours in, and i'm too bored to continue.  ---Prerequisite system info--- I'm playing on a 980ti at 2560x1440 with everything (including temporal AA) maxed and I'm averaging 85fps with adaptive gsync. It's steady and I have no real issues with the performance. Great job devs.  ----DAY 01--- I like the graphics and sound. The game has a good atmosphere, especially at night time. The guns are servicable. As others have commented, they do lack punch. Gameplay is a little repetitive, but the action is solid so its not that bad. Overall, for my first two hours I would say that the game is stable, fast and enjoyable. I just hope the gameplay opens up a little bit and expands on what you do as the player, because after taking over all the areas of the starting zone, you realize how large the map is and wonder if the gameplay will be repetitive throughout that whole experience. We'll see! Recommended.  ---DAY 02--- I've returned to the game and it's obvious there are some possible issues. First, the game is constantly streaming data. This makes sense given the open world nature, however I would go so far as to say this is borderline trashing the hard drive. The data streaming never really interferes with the gameplay, but it does result in some texture and geometry popin. Given that I'm on a fairly powerful rig and using a 6TB WD Black, the amount of IO needed to sustain the world is somewhat surprising. Suggest that you run this one from SSD or NVME if you can spare the 40 (!) TB.  As far as the game itself, I have to admit the world is starting to feel kind of flat after only 3-4 hours in. There is an abundance of good (mostly) VO work to help things along, but the mute player protagonist just seens to have nothing to say in a world so full of things to comment on. The missions and orders you receive all start to sound the same. After capturing the entirety of the first section of the map, I felt that there just wouldn't be much else to do. Its like Farcry, only less open and more modern. Maybe the most damning part of it all is that after roughly 4 hours, i'm just too bored to continue playing. There are not enough mechanics or story hooks to keep me going. It's just one mission after the next. Shame, this game has good ideas for what it wants to be, it just fails to execute them into something that is compelling to play.
3311	1	a	great game looks amazing :D but could do with some performance improvements
3313	1	a	  Not a bad FPS and while I dont intend on buying it after the free weekend, I would recommend it if it stays in the 20 dollar price range as there seems to be plenty of content in the base game.

1549	0	a	Now, i enjoy playing this game, but its filled with bugs. I enjoy the combat, the takedown animations and the gurilla style warfare. But damn, so many flaws. There are points in this game, where you think 'What the **** is going on?'. It can be from the AI bugging out, not spotting you, the fact that you are the only one required to wear a gasmask at a certain point and so on.... Logic has been thrown out the window completly with this game. But still, i enjoy the game. Even though its rage inducing. I dont recommend buying it!
3315	1	a	  The game is good. I beat it in 8 hours during the free weekend. I would say it's worth $20 or less. My main issue with the story is the idea that North Korea is so advanced in technology and military warfare. It's almost laughable. Russians or the Chinese would have been more believable. Good game otherwise. I would give this a 6/10.
3317	1	a	Wow am I faving fun with this one. I'm really not sure what people were expecting but if you like FarCry you will love this.
3319	1	a	seems like any issues that were in place have been resolved. I am having a great time running through the world shooting and blowing things up, while scrounging for valuables to sell. I have no complaints. Given the history with this games development, what we have now is playable, and to me at least, fun.
1554	0	a	Meh. Okay-ish game. So bland on every aspect that I don't know what else to say.  5/10
1555	0	a	  the coop mode would be fun with 1-3 friends for about 5 € and the rest (graphic, gunplay, balancing) is absolute garbage (played it for 1 hour at free weekend)

CONS: - ...Good ideas that go poorly executed. - Mute player character - Flat characters and near meaningless interaction - Story that doesn't deliver. - 4 hours in, and i'm too bored to continue.  ---Prerequisite system info--- I'm playing on a 980ti at 2560x1440 with everything (including temporal AA) maxed and I'm averaging 85fps with adaptive gsync. It's steady and I have no real issues with the performance. Great job devs.  ----DAY 01--- I like the graphics and sound. The game has a good atmosphere, especially at night time. The guns are servicable. As others have commented, they do lack punch. Gameplay is a little repetitive, but the action is solid so its not that bad. Overall, for my first two hours I would say that the game is stable, fast and enjoyable. I just hope the gameplay opens up a little bit and expands on what you do as the player, because after taking over all the areas of the starting zone, you realize how large the map is and wonder if the gameplay will be repetitive throughout that whole experience. We'll see! Recommended.  ---DAY 02--- I've returned to the game and it's obvious there are some possible issues. First, the game is constantly streaming data. This makes sense given the open world nature, however I would go so far as to say this is borderline trashing the hard drive. The data streaming never really interferes with the gameplay, but it does result in some texture and geometry popin. Given that I'm on a fairly powerful rig and using a 6TB WD Black, the amount of IO needed to sustain the world is somewhat surprising. Suggest that you run this one from SSD or NVME if you can spare the 40 (!) TB.  As far as the game itself, I have to admit the world is starting to feel kind of flat after only 3-4 hours in. There is an abundance of good (mostly) VO work to help things along, but the mute player protagonist just seens to have nothing to say in a world so full of things to comment on. The missions and orders you receive all start to sound the same. After capturing the entirety of the first section of the map, I felt that there just wouldn't be much else to do. Its like Farcry, only less open and more modern. Maybe the most damning part of it all is that after roughly 4 hours, i'm just too bored to continue playing. There are not enough mechanics or story hooks to keep me going. It's just one mission after the next. Shame, this game has good ideas for what it wants to be, it just fails to execute them into something that is compelling to play.
3323	1	a	If your on the fence buying this, i say go for it. Far Cry gets boring after awhile, but this game i keep coming back to. Havent had any proformces issues running a 4790K/1070gtx and no bugs so far.
3325	1	a	This game has it, but definitely needs optimization. From what i saw in previous posts, I dont think it matters what badass setup your running and SLI is compatible at this time. If you think it is, take a look at your data analysis, should show you your primary card is the only one getting abused at 99%. there is no way your going to get good or even smooth play frame rates. expecially in city . your looking at 15-25 maybe......hide in a dumpster your golden right back at 60 -140. you cant stay in there all day and win your revolution.  for me its 60/40 % 60 smooth play game looks great gets repetative but coop is more fun......40 it lags to the point i just rage and jump to another game. to me at this point till an update to address this i cant recommend anyone to get this not until you see comments that its just repetative NOT that it LAGS like the release of STAR CITIZEN  Well I Now stand to correct my review. I should have done this a little sooner. The game has been optimized a lot better since my review. I am able to max everything out in 4k BUT LEAVING ANTI ALIAZING OFF. Its really just overkill at that resolution. So I'm now at a very playable stable 50fps avg with Vsync on. I use an OLED TV. My setup is more akin to console style being an early pioneer of HTPC. I game on my pc in comfort from a movie theatre style recliner with heated and chilled drink holders and customized pull out keyboard or food tray tables. I would not dare game from a desk. Now that Homefront is playable I can say its not too bad. Its not that good either. The play through of the story is somewhat decent and the graphics are quite enjoyable to watch. What brings it down for me is it feels after about 2hrs of straight playthrough it just get stale. The bases and objectives you have conquer in between major story plots gets repetitive. There just should be more to taking over a controlled base then running in and syncing a laptop or blowing up fuel containers. As good as the detailed graphics are, it just doesn't feel rewarding to gun through slopes you have to go through. Except close combat now thats not bad, when you get to watch the eyes of your victim role up in the back of their heads when you jam your blade up though their jaw(cool). I haven't tried the co-op part yet which I want to do. So as of now I can recommend the game in its fixxed state i'm giving it a 7 of 10. just cause thae graphics are great and if you play through quick the major story plot are very good keeping you engaged. Future story additions will be very welcome and if the co-op adds more life to Homefront i could give it an 8.  There is something I'm noticing while playing through and thats a real bad flaring effect. Its like having the sun right in your eyes. I though it was bad coding from having bloom on but its not that, for it still happens when I have it off. Its from time to time going in and out of buildings. Something I'm hoping for is more weapons and devices to be more sinister on killing these Koreans, being able to to hijack tanks and trucks and mowing down the enemy would be a welcome addition.
3327	1	a	I pre-ordered this game the day before it came out because I like spending money and, well, it's honestly nothing too remarkable. I remember it but nothing stood out as incredible which is a shame. I do remember liking the multiplayer more then the single player but considering nobody really plays this game anymore, nothing much there to do.  all in all, for the price now and after the recent update, I'd buy it. Good time for a couple days.
3329	1	a	  playable.   Yes I have played it over the free weekend ONLY, this may skew my views on it.   Game is playable but nothing ground breaking.   As with most FPS' nowadays. there is a limited crafting system thats not fun. The shooting is not amazing but it gets its point across.   I had frame rate drops fairly regularly, as did most of the reviewers I have seen. This was mostly on the Bikes so I avoided them.
1561	0	a	I wouldn't write anything more than other already do but this game is not very inspired, it is hard to go on with this revolution, you simply don't feel anything at all, after you play enough with gun system, unlock gadgets and so on there is nothing more to do and keep you playing. And on top of this all that open world weakness go there and liberate another 'radio tower' or something like that thi,s time waster and you have to do that to progress and it is painful. Enemy AI is bad, spawning system is even worse, enemies sometimes just spawn behind your back and say surprise with bullet! :)  on plus side there time splitters 2 in this game if you will play long enough trough story to discover it, so it is not that bad after all :) 
3331	1	a	I didnt read eny reveiws about this game before i played it and also finished it . I really enjoyed it its alot like far cry 4 but in a city
1562	0	a	  It's hard to call this a good game when it's so buggy and crashes often, but aside the deal breaker, this game has good graphics, compeling storyline, interesting weapon modding system and creative tools to get stuff done. But again, sadly, i can't play this game for more than 45 mins without crashing.  Hopefully it's not buggy for everyone.
3333	1	a	  I got this game on the free weekend (sept 2016) and it was a BLAST!   Steam's review system should document if the reviewer's system meets specs and has up to date drivers (or at least if the reviewer claims they do), because I think a lot of people grabbed a free game hoping it'd run on a sub-spec system and they lashed out at the game when it didn't. Why else would someone make a complaint that isn't even legit... 'too few guns?' It has at least pistol, pnematic pistol, smg, crossbow, blunderbuss, AR, battle rifle, LMG, shotgun, limpet gun, and RPG. Add to that 4 types of thrown weapons (incendiary, explosive, hack tool, distractor) each with 4 subtypes, total 16. Plus knife, bolt cutters, flashlight...  With the difficulty on recruit mode it was non-stop action. I'm sure more stealth is needed at higher diffuculties. Free-running though controlled zones looking for targets of opportunity like equipment sabotage targets and lone soldiers to silent-takedown... jumping from scaffolding to rooftops and through upper floor windows, looting valuables... frantically looking for a dumpster or portapotty to hide in... what's not to love? It's like Mirror's Edge meets Far Cry. Plenty of side missions can be done in any order or ignored as you like. It took 16 hours for the main mission and about half the side missions, none of the job missions, and very few of the flash missions (optional missions that appear without warning).  I love the game's moral choices... imagine you are an operative in an occupied zone on an important mission and you get an opportunity to save some civilians getting a beatdown from bully occupiers, but only by blowing your cover. Take the chance or sacrifice them... clock's ticking! Will you use remote explosives blindly with the possibility an innocent will walk by them?  The characters are well fleshed out. Dana's a complete psychopath, the doc has his own priorities, reasonable characters all have different outlooks on the occupation, the NPC chatter is diverse and on topic, and I didn't see the game re-use any faces for different people, very well done. The graphics are amazing - at one point while hiding behind a dirty old dumpster next to a chain fence with ivy growing on it I felt like I was looking at a real photo.  I had 2 crashes to desktop during the my entire 16 hour campaign. Core i7, 16gb, GTX970.
3335	1	a	korean hunting simulator... I love that crossbow  + -Great atmosphere and concept -Graphic, details, rain  -Weapon customization on the go  -Awesome animations and cutscenes  - -AI is derping out... sometimes  -I would appreciate more weapon customizations -Bugs and glitches, NPC got stuck and i couldn't get past him... fixed on checkpoint reset  Speechless guy shooting KPA with 'Real American Steel'   9/10
1563	0	a	Farcry: Red Dawn.  Its ok. Much much better than the original. But still nothing amazing. If you enjoy a zero challange forumalic open world game with lots of mind numbing busy work then you'll like this.  -Edit Originally I gave it a thumbs up, Now changing my review to negative since I've encountered a bunch of game breaking bugs right near the end, That wont let me progress without having to replay a massive section of the game. No thanks.
1564	0	a	This game is a mess, the orginal homefront is way better than this steaming pile of crap. It plays worse than alot of free to play fps games out there.  Character movement is as fluent as Deus ex 1.... scratch that it's worse with the stuttering movement. Tried to play it after 1.5 patch, it's still crap. Loved homefront 1 Hate this.
3337	1	a	At the moment (2.5 hours played) I have not any problems with performance. The argument is interesting and the game is enjoyable. It has problems with the controls and the aim, I think they could be better. I recommend this game if you like free world games (like far cry). In my case I bought it for 20 euros and I think is a good prize, but I dont recommend pay more for this game. Note: 7/10
1565	0	a	  Alright so, let me give full disclosure to start, I played this game in the free weekend that Steam offered on the 9th-11th September.   First of all, there were things to enjoy about this game. The gameplay wasn’t too bad - Far-Cry esque in an occupied city where the underground revolution (you) has to take down the occupants he can, destroy their equipment and earn his freedom. It was almost Terminator 2 like, popping out of a ruined building to lob a pipe-bomb at a passing mech and quickly get back down to snipe a few soldiers advancing towards you.  The exploration, taking over districts by doing a variety of different tasks (Strike Points through hacking, killing soldiers stationed there, finding HAM radios, etc.), helping civilians there, and a number of collectables (radios, propaganda speakers, fuel storage tanks) - all of this was fairly enjoyable. I like open world gameplay where you start off outnumbered and hopeless and become the main force by the end of the game - standard linear progression yes, but it makes for a fun experience of being the hero.  The story is an interesting concept. North Koreans started up the tech giants, Americans flooded to buy their gear (computers, tablets, phones, and even military equipment) only for it all to have a backdoor allowing NK to easily invade. The large zeppelin airships that watch over cities, looking out for trouble with their spotlights which you have to avoid (or be faced with endless soldiers until you get to safety/hide somewhere), patrolling armoured vehicles and mechs, it was all pretty cool and eerie.  Graphically, this game looks pretty good. Textures are nice, effects are pretty good, once you get into an area that’s been gassed you get to see all the particle effects of toxins in the air and all the dust from the dilapidated factories and structures that are in the area.  Though of course, this is a negative rating I’m giving. And it’s probably expected. The performance.  The performance can be pretty abysmal at times - even on a pretty good machine (i7-6700k, GTX 980ti, 16GB RAM). It started off alright, but frame drops can be frequent (be warned, CLOSE ALL BACKGROUND PROGRAMS. I had YouTube open on my other monitor to watch some stuff whilst I took over districts and my framerate tanked hard - dropping to unplayable rates and stuttering every 10-20 seconds sometimes). It gets worse the longer you play - I recommend restarting the game now and then whilst you play so it doesn’t tank as hard.  The game also gets glitches. One strikepoint was unavailable to me (chop shop) and it appears to be a common occurrence according to the Internet. I had to download a trainer to allow me to float upwards (cheat my way basically) up and through the side of the building as the garage door refused to open once the generator was running. I also spawned once in a mission with no resistance soldiers with me - facing a few dozen NK soldiers, the game then gave me a game over screen as my “resistance soldiers had died when they never even spawned in game. Achievements are also pretty glitched. They stop tracking when you play, so there are quite a few I am missing which I clearly achieved (I liberated all Strike Points, free’d every district yet apparently I barely got over half of them according to the Steam achievement tracker. Several other ones didn’t unlock either).  If this game got fixed - polished up a bit with the performance optimised and the glitches buffed out I’d buy this game no problem. It seems alright - it’s not too long but it’s long enough and doesn’t outstay it’s welcome at all and is what you’d want out of this style of game. Too long and it drags on. The devs seem pretty honest people, with the credits opening with some story about the development problems that plagued this game, and even after all the disasters post-launch they are doing things to progress it a bit at least. Time will tell, if the problems do get fixed then this will change into a positive review for sure.
3339	1	a	I cannot believe the reviews that put this game down. Expansive, replayable etc
3341	1	a	I tried this game on a Free Weekend and decided to buy it. The graphics are awesome. You can carry two primary and a secondary weapon at a time, but all of those can be converted to two more on the fly (does SW Republic Commando ring any bells?). As of the current patch (v1.06 I believe), the game seems stable. The issues are all related to stealth: enemies are spawning too frequently and too close to the player, the detection/alert system needs a complete overhaul. Only the pistol and SMG can be equipped with a silencer in single player mode. To have a viable medium/long range silenced weapon, you have to fully upgrade the crossbow. Otherwise, the gameplay is fine, you have plenty of weapons, attachments and gadgets to fit your playstyle. It's an open world game divided into war zones and heavily policed regions. There is no PvP, only co-op missions on separate maps.
3343	1	a	Not Bad
3345	1	a	so far no bugs and a ton of fun to play
1567	0	a	The game could have a lot of potentials, but had some serious flaws with the fundamental game designs. The biggest problem with the game is infinite spawning of enemy NPCs, and the respawn frequency is way too fast. If you want to enter an area that's heavily guarded, you cannot simply clear the area by sniping everyone while being stealthy. The enemies will spawn right back after about 30 seconds. If you're spotted by enemies while you're on a mission, you cannot simply go loud and kill everyone because more enemies will respawn around you right after. You can only run away from them and hide, and hope they'll forget about you. On top of the issue with infinite respawns, your health regenration rate is unresonably slow. The combination of the two problems made me hate the game pretty fast.
1568	0	a	My immediate first impression points towards this game having a lot of ambitous takes on the homefront series, the inclusion of free roam allows you to play this game as blandly or as badass as you want.   Scenarios in which the ai get into all out war with eachother are common but add some flare to the game, makes the world feel volitile. the games optimization could use some work from what I'm seeing in the disscussions a lot of people are reporting poor framerate.
1569	0	a	after the many hours of me playing this game to give it a good review i say if you can't get it for under $20 dont buy it   first 2 hrs are worth it everything else not worth it.
3347	1	a	The game is a lot of fun the AI is stupid and spawns enimies right on top of you a lot, which gets irritating yet funny when the npc tuns its back to duck away fome you while you standing behind them. But still fun
3349	1	a	Homefront: The Revolution was a lot of fun. The playstyle was what I was expecting and the game has entertained me to this point. There are bugs here and there, but nothing that will break the game. It looks visually pleasing and plays smooth during all points of the game. Simple fun that is totally worth the SALE price.
3351	1	a	The shooting mechanics are decent. The cinematics are cool too. The intro is lllllooooonnnnnng. It's I don't know, I hate that crap. The overall feel like Half life 2 in a way, which ticked a box for me. That may be what's keeping me playing, some sort of nostalgia not sure yet.  Just started it, I'm 59 minutes into it. So far, it's decent. It's got it's moments, and some stupid moments like when you 'hack' (can't even call it that, moving a mouse around is pretty lame why even bother) the relay tower after you meet Dana - the whole base is suddenly built while your in the room.    I'm disliking the currency far cry style vending machines. It's still early I understand, so I can't really judge it hard. I also just figured out I'm playing the second homefront (just looked it up) so oops. Makes me think I need to stop playing this and go play that then this. Hmm  
3353	1	a	A bit cheesy and dodgy here and there but performance is solid, it looks fantastic and the gameplay is fun.  The DLC is good but awfully short at about 3h a piece, so unless you bought the season pass on sale don't bother.
1573	0	a	Uninspired gameplay and graphics that are on-par with other titles but don't stand out hamper my enjoyment Homefront: The Revolution. Unfortunately, it doesn't compensate by capitalizing on its somewhat novel story: America is now subject to rule by North Korea, and you are part of an insurgency fighting them. The game tries to pass off what you're doing and people's suffering, but just fails. I never felt involved with the characters. Attempts to portray Americans in the ghettos as oppressed fell flat, just the developers trying to inject emotion. The worst were the constant radio updates from resistance members that sounded just so chipper to go out scouting when they're supposed to be pariahs suffering at the hands of this dictatorship. Ugh, just the worst.
3355	1	a	I played this game during the FREE WEEKEND on steam.  Now the review. I went into this game excited as I've been watching this game ever since it was announced but was saddened by all the negative reviews. When there was a free weekend I was stoked and tried it out.  First off the graphics are very detailed and the lighting effects are amazing. Just the general atmoshpere is really immersive as you feel like you are living within an occupied city. The story seems a bit far fetched but hey its still a good game.  Secondly I will say that from the time I played it I realise why people were mad about the game as you do need a beefy computer in order to run it but they have released patches to make the game run smoother but since I do not have the game yet I do not know how big of a change this has had. Luckily my computer is beefy and ran the game very well.  So overall I enjoyed it but do admit the game was unoptimized at the time and a slightly beefy computer was required for this game. Once I buy the game I'll update my review to give a more complete review of it.
1574	0	a	great game except for the error code 132 which wont let me on and this is not the first time this has happened  sort this out please because this is just not acceptable i have payed for the game so expect to play it when i want and not repeatedly get this error which wont let me on private match or public match
3357	1	a	Issues have been mostly ironed out. Solid campaign and Co-op.
3359	1	a	  good game the online dont work
3361	1	a	They finally fixed some issues.  still, the game is noat as good as expected.
3363	1	a	I'll admit, after reading initial reviews I had my doubts. But Homefront: The Revolution (H:TR) turned out great. If you're a fan of the Red Faction series of games then you'll fit right in.  H:TR is an open world FPS that sees you take on the role of Ethan Brady an eager recruit for the resistance movement in Phillidelphia. Needless to say shenanigans ensue as you capture locations to further your cause and stir up local populations into rebellion!  I had a blast with this and I didn't think I would! I loved every second of it! I was an American citizen, fighting to free my country, Hell yes!  I only encountered two things about the title I didn't like:  1) Lag despite vastly superior hardware. This was more of an annoyance than anything but still thought I should mention it. I run this game on the following:  Win 7 HP SP 1  AMD FX 6300 6 core  8GB RAM  NVIDIA Geforce 970  2) Dry Co-op. The cooperative 'Resistance Mode' sees you and four others tacle an objective against A.I. opponents. Through victory you earn money to buy weapons and attachments as well as level your own custom resistance fighter. Only down side is I was expecting something like a co-op campaign or something along those lines.  All in all 9/10 depite minor issues and lots of fun to be had!
1576	0	a	At first glance, this game holds a lot of promise... looks like it will be heaps of fun for people who enjoyed the Far Cry franchise. Sadly, it completely fails to live up to expectations...  1. There are a heap of clipping problems. Enemies see you through walls. In some places, enemies walk through walls. Things and people sink into floors. Some items you need to gather are unreachable because the buggy clipping stops them from falling into your reach. 2. Weird AI. Its like it was engineered to be annoying. You know those enemies that somehow miraculously know to duck when you target them with your sniper rifle? And then jump out of cover if you turn your back on them - when you're completely behind cover and they can't possibly see that you've turned your back. After a couple of hours, I started to use this technique to draw enemies out of cover. Its kind of funny making enemies dance by pointing a sniper rifle at them - watching them lurch from side to side to avoid the sniper's line of fire. 3. Scripting glitches. Some of the missions become impossible to complete because of some lazy scripting on the part of the programmers. 4. Infinite enemies. I've always been challenged by whether a game should have reasonable 'reinforcements' mechanics - but in this game, well... its just more lazy coding. Enemies randomly spawn infinitely. The programmers tried to cut some code so that enemies don't spawn where you're looking - but they screwed that up too.  After many hours of persisting in the hopes that things would get better, I'm abandoning it.
3365	1	a	I'm assuming it must have been some pretty horrid optimization and/or bugs that had folks giving this game such poor reviews when it first released. Bought it during the 2016 Winter sale and have had a bug-free, smooth playing experience.  The game itself is great. It takes the Far Cry approach to the open world but pulls it off much better in my opinion. Has yet to feel repetitive or stale and despite people knocking it, have really been enjoying the story. If you grew up watching movies like the original Red Dawn you will love the overall feel and atmosphere.   Visually it's excellent. The Crytek engine is on full display and everything from the lighting to the characters is well above average. The gameplay is great fun. I have really enjoyed the way they mix stealth and action, leaving the player great freedom in approaching most situations. Watching the Norks abuse and kill your Countrymen adds a nice layer of satisfaction when you sneak up on them and plunge a knife into back or neck.  It was about $12 during the sale, which is a ridiculous amount of fun for the money. I could have spent $30 and been plenty happy, hell, I could have probably spent $60 and not been upset with the purchase.  Have yet to try online co-op, but I bought this game for the story and the single player atmosphere more than anything.   Great sequel to the original Homefront that is better than the previous game in every way on the single player front.  8/10 - would stab a Nork in the face again for telling my countryman to lick their boot

3367	1	a	  come join us i want more this games
3369	1	a	I honestly don't know why it got all these bad reviews. The single player is really enjoyable and the design of the maps is outstanding. What really sticked out for me were the day and night cycles and how that changed a map. It's not the best shooter I have played it but it's the best recent single player shooter for sure. It got me hooked until the end.
3371	1	a	Good game for the price. Bugs, allies get in the way a lot and it is easy to get stuck in rubble.
3373	1	a	Great game graphics 10/10 story is good customization is great all works good but if u want to run this game good u need to GTX 900 series or better.... This game has potato optimization :=). But i still recomended for playing
3375	1	a	A solid game, plays like Far Cry but in a city.
3377	1	a	Far Cry 4 divaded by 2. Kinda nice after you fixe the performance issues.
3379	1	a	Better that reviews.  Seems to be patched quite well since lauch. Was no were near complete at that point.  Not perfect but delivers fun querilla stuff in nice setting. Far Cry all over it but has more serious tone in it.  With 12 € it is a quite a bargain!
1578	0	a	Took me 40 minutes to get into the actual game only to get killed instanly. The ♥♥♥♥ went wrong with this game? I liked the idea and trailer and this ♥♥♥♥ is garbage. Dont touch it.
3381	1	a	Q: Is this a good game? A: No. This game is not good.  Q: Is this game worth playing? A: Yes.  In Inquisitor, you play as an inquistor (duh..) who were send to investigate a case of a murder in a small town. You can choose to play from 3 character, either as a paladin of the brotherhood (knight), a noble (thief) or a priest (sorcerer).  The game takes investigation and detective works seriously and does not hold your hand like modern games - there is no quest marker, only logs of quests and hints. Hints are gathered from talking to NPCs, asking them questions. Now, there is no real brain involved in gathering hints - you just talk to ALL the NPCs and eventually some clue will be uncovered. After the all the detective work, it all end to one thing: is the suspect really a heretic or just an innocent? You decide.  Convicting people under the charge of heresy need proof. Proof can be a spoken testimony from witnesses or a physical thing like a broken dagger. This detective work will involve lots of wall of texts, so be prepared to do some reading.  Inquisitor really puts you into the atmosphere and setting. You're involved in the age where heresy are on a rampant. Everyone accuses someone as a heretic. People are very suspicious to each other.  Now to the major flaw of the game. Inquisitor tries to be an RPG which is heavy on the 'talking and reading' part - immersive story and atmosphere like Planescape Torment (I never really like this game though), and tries at the same time to be an action oriented RPG with fluent combat like the Diablo series. Inquisitor fails terribly on the latter part.  Combat in Inquisitor feels like a chore. You'll be chugging potions all the time. Your equipment will be broken in the middle of a battle most of the time (if you choose difficulty other than easy). Your melee attack misses all the time and when you actually landed an attack on the enemy, you're already run out of stamina. The combat need serious rebalancing in reworked, but it is very unlikely that this game will be updated in the near future since the developers already left the game. The whole development of Inquisitor takes around 10 years.   The game is divided into 3 acts. Only the first act really impressed me since it really emphasize on the inquisition stuff and investigations. Further into the game, the game lost its momentum and instead of uncovering heretics and doing inquisition stuff, you'll need to clear several dungeons that are filled with crazy debuff inflicting monsters that are totally not enjoyable.  I think I was 80% to finishing this game until I decided that I cannot tolerate the combat anymore. Even with the major flaw Inquisitor is a game that you might not want to miss if you like old school RPG.
3383	1	a	Reporting a successful completion. It took me mind-boggling 141 hour, longer than any game so far. The ride has been excruciating at times, but mostly fun and oh-so-exciting! I thoroughly enjoyed the dark and gritty atmosphere, uncompromising and flagrant with its blood-chilling displays of human decadence. I love how rough the game is, with no immersion-breaking silliness like quest compass and highlighted levers, common to many modern 'streamlined' titles. Instead, this game targets the no-nonsense old-school player that does not expect to be spoon-fed. And it is glorious. The general sense of paranoia and imminent doom permeate at all times, and feel rather genuine. This is something few titles can be proud of. The writing is top-notch, the look and feel befitting, the difficulty finally done right. The setting and system are original, so you'll see no fireball spells, Dwarfs, Elves and other utterly overused and abused tropes.  On the other hand, numerous problems exist, spearheaded by the occasionally unpleasant amount of filler-content. Additionally, there is a visible lack of progression in rewards - items you get in the first Act are the best in the game. It doesn't help that items are randomly spec'd making them feel ultimately unimaginative and underwhelming. There is also a visible lack of low-level crowd-control spells and tactics, which is a serious hindrance in a game constantly exposing the player to fights against hordes of enemies. This makes kiting the only applicable tactic sometimes rendering the fights slow and boring.  ** IMPORTANT ** It is relevant to know that playing a priest makes the experience better as priests require the least amount of stamina and are not as dependent on weapons, so backtracking to towns and stockpiling potions are not as big issues as with other classes. If you (loosely) follow this guide, your character is guaranteed to be a powerhouse:  https://www.gog.com/forum/inquisitor/how_to_build_a_priest_in_hard_mode   Still, when all is settled, the game was a very solid experience for me that I wholeheartedly recommend. It is obviously a labor of love and deserves your attention.
3385	1	a	 Positives   + Complex and engaging storyline. Well constructed plot with lots of twists and turns. + A stiff challenge, without being impossible. There is always eventually a way to progress from even the toughest situation. + Somewhat addictive. Despite the awkward controls and combat, I couldn't help but keep coming back to the game. + The negative effects system on the player character was a nice touch. For example, suffering from blindness would make the mouse cursor disappear, or confusion would reverse the mouse controls. + Very much enjoyed the trial system of collecting evidence in order to put a suspect on trial. The torture system is also very creative and interesting (as well as being sadistically realistic!)   Negatives   - Bugged beyond belief! So many irritating bugs, some of which will crash to desktop or require and emergency exit. Save regularly. - Numerous spelling and grammatical mistakes. Some sections have not translated into Englsih well at all. - Awkward combat system. Some of the combat skills don't appear to work (or have so little effect as to make them not worthwhile investing in), item damage is somewhat inconsistent and unrealistic and many encounters felt like just a health and stamina potion loading exercise to survive. - Was not keen on the randomised stat attributes on weapons and armour, which can result in the player spending hours cycling through merchant stocks until they chance upon their desired item. There is no levelling to this process, so as soon as you are able to wield/wear the item, you could effectively receive the most powerful of its type which would last you through to the end of the game. The randomisation can make powerful , unique items that you receive as late game quest rewards significantly less useful than an item you picked up in the first act.   Overall   Despite all my gripes, I have to recommend the game, as I have enjoyed playing it very much. It hooked me in and the storyline was particularly engrossing. However, I constantly find myself thinking up ways in which the game could have been done better - there are so many things that weren’t quite taken advantage of. I'm hoping that a sequel is on the cards, as with a little polishing and ironing out of some issues, there is potential for a real quality game here.
3387	1	a	Inquisitor is an old school RPG with a long story about persecution of heretics, torture of people both innocent and guilty, decent amount of curse words, poverty and death, possibility to help or diss people, pub minigames and that all in a world and history based on our own.    Pros
3389	1	a	Inquisitor tries to emphasize your role as an inquisitional investigator over the role of the average hack-and-slash adventurer. When it succeeds at doing so, the game is good, great even. My fondest moments with Inquisitor involve happening upon a random person in an unexpected place, as I was always eager to begin questioning in hopes of learning a tidbit of information that could point to a heretic (and the entirety of the townsfolk were already squeezed dry of new leads). This didn't always pan out of course, many questions just result in a dead end, but that's exactly what made the experience so enjoyable. Without the cut and dried certainty that any NPC or line of dialogue important enough to be coded in would be important enough to move the plot forward, full scrutiny must be applied to everything. Complete exploration was thus also worthwhile, especially with the risk of torturing or burning an innocent at stake. The game goes wrong, however, when it turns away from text-based investigation and throws itself headlong into dungeon crawling. The combat is both obtuse and tedious. Enemies give no indication of how much life they may have or how close you may have been to defeating them which means that there's no way of telling if you were on the verge of success or if you need to completely reevaluate your approach. Weapons and armor break at alarming rates and with dungeons that may go on for anywhere from three to nine full floors; even devoting a quarter of your inventory to replacements will see you making a couple of trips to the surface for repairs. Status effects have a similar feeling to them, like they may have been designed for causing pain over fun. Poison lasts for nearly four full minutes and drains both health and stamina, the latter being the resource needed to fight effectively. Some status aliments skip the character and affect the player directly by changing the cursor's behavior. Blindness, disorientation and confusion cause the cursor to disappear, invert, or wiggle around. These ideas themselves are interesting and could be used to make for a more tense experience, but any charm or fear they might have inflicted is killed by their frequency; there is simply no avoiding them. The lesson the game seems to teach, then, is not to bother out-thinking or overpowering your enemies, but just to accept more losses. Expect to use more potions, have more equipment break, and see more companions die in order to finish each successive encounter. Which, oddly enough, suits the dirty, violent, depressing aesthetic of the setting. Inquisitor pulls no punches with its set pieces. There will be mass graves, disemboweled corpses, and tortured screams, all in full detail. The background music and the item descriptions buttress this effect, making for a truly unsettling experience. If you can see your way past the slog that is combat, past the typos, past the irritation of getting stuck in a wall for the tenth time, there is the skeleton of a fantastic game here. And one well worth trying.
1580	0	a	Inquisitor is a great idea. Poorly executed. Don't get me wrong, I'm playing the game, I'm almost a dozen hours in and it's somewhat challenging, however the mechanics are poorly designed. Here's an example: you don't need the identify skill because you can cast a spell that identifies everything in your inventory. You must swap out spells from your quickslots(of which there just aren't enough) mid battle, which can be pretty annoying and can get you killed quite easily. For a game the devs spent 7+ years on(they say 2 or 3 of translations I think) they really didn't do very well. This game deserves its metascore, but you really can't go wrong for 10 USD, it's still fairly fun. It's just very gimmicky and like I said, the mechanics suck at higher levels.
3391	1	a	Awesome game, unless you don´t like to read, let´s make it clear from the start.  It´s a game for you if you really like RPGs, and by that I mean, playing a role in an amazing story, with complex characters, motive, and storyline in general.  Dialog takes time, there´s a lot to ask, and all NPCs have distinct personalities, opinions, and clues (except for those labeled with generic names, like soldier), and it really sets the dark mood of the inquisition times. Everyone is afraid of ending up a suspect of heresy, and they are all more then willing to spread rumors about their neighbours.   It´s set in the middle ages, and you play as a menber of the holy inquisition (at least playing as a priest, there are 3 classes, priest, paladin and thief, so I assume they have different backgrounds), but in the game there´s magic and monsters.  There are 6 different scholls of magic to choose from, and many skills. All of wich you can upgrade as you level up, along with your attributes. One of my favorite parts in an RPG is the character creation, and this game does a good job at that, you can see there´s replayability in a game when you go through it wondering how it would be like playing a different class, and that sure happens here. For instance, everyone calls me father, and I get to paternalize everyone, or even offer to hear confessions, stuff like that. I wonder how is it like as a thief, it´s bound to be very different, the dialogs at least, and that´s the real core of the game, dialog. Imagine an awesome book, where you get to play as the main char, this is not actually labeled as a visual novel, but from a certain point of view it could be. combat and graphics are simple, but that´s not what matters in this game, would you judge a book by it´s graphics?   It´s a masterpiece.   One complain though, theres a nice soundtrack but it´s sporadic, sometimes I´m reading a dialog for 15 minutes and there´s no background music playing at all, then it starts for a while, then stops again. what´s up with that?
3393	1	a	This game isn't for the casual player. It's a hardcore RPG that you have to put time into in order to get into it, as I have found out. It's similar to Morrowind in the fact that it gives you next to no direction, so you have to find stuff out for yourself. I personally think it's awesome, it's got an in depth story that reeks adventure and the chatacters are all well developed too. At first you may think the graphics are utter crap, but they really do fit in with the feel of the game. As I said, the casual player beware, as this game isn't for the feint hearted.
3395	1	a	Dark days have beset us men and its up to us to fight for the light of justice and right with the pious instruments of interogation and erradication of the dark ones amidst us... either we cleanse their souls or we char their forsaken flesh.   Let's get to work and break out the bonbons =D!
1581	0	a	Just completed the game and I'm not sure if I would ever play it again. Inquisitor really shines with its '90s CRPG nostalgia goodness, but delivers a frustrating experience in certain key areas. For TLDR, skip to section below for Final Judgement.    The Blessings
3397	1	a	Expertly written with classic, challenging isometric gameplay (which, admittedly, suffers from the limitations of its stylistic predecessors), Inquisitor is an excellent roleplaying experience. And, when I say challenging, I mean, very challenging (maybe I missed some essential way to make combat easy), but very rewarding.
3399	1	a	Best of cRPG game in decade. One of best games I have ever played. This game has a soul. I recomend any RPG fan who like good plot ,setting , music and very dynamical combat system . I hope that will be sequel soon.
1583	0	a	The lore of this game is immense. I wish I could brag about being a big, bad hardcore RPG'er who savored every bit of it, but it overwhelmed me and I wound up zooming through it, hoping that it contained no vital information. Every inhabitant of the doomed little village you start out in has loads to tell you. Loads! If you try the game, please do the developer justice and listen to it, so that I can rest my guilt over this. I'm an ungrateful ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, because the creators of this game have really put in an effort here.  The graphics have a dated feel and I could live with that. My biggest gripe is that the character moves very slowly across the screen. He's a snail. And the battles are way too hard in the beginning, which makes it frustrating to get to know the game. It should not affect how I judge this game, but I'm a pitiful gamer who prefers having an illusion of challenge and feel good about myself when I steamroll over it. Please shoot me.
3401	1	a	Polarizing? Absolutely. Its a game with a 90 degree learning curve, antiquated systems, and a glacial game speed. Though, I find myself absolutely drawn to it. Before I bought the collectors edition on release date, I heard nothing but bad news about this game. Unplayable, they said. Arcane, it said... yet I still bit the bullet and bought it.  It isn't streamlined, minor tasks are difficult, and you will find yourself save scumming. It took me forever to get through the inital quest, but something kept me playing. I realized it was the story. An interesting world, fascinating systems, and a dark grim world that is a joy to explore. Add in detective elements as you play the titular inquisitor, and you have yourself something not quite polished, but unique and fascinating. If you can brave the lackluster gameplay, you'll find yourself drawn to the dark world surrounding it.  That being said, 10 dollars is a lot to ask, wait for a discount.
3403	1	a	A little difficult to get used to the combat and how you interact with the game but the storyline is so detailed it makes up for any minor technical issue. Someone very creative designed this plot and put mountains of effort into lore. The world created for this game feels very real.
3405	1	a	I cant help thinking how much effort developers put into this game, you can write a full book with that much diaologue. Artwork is amazing especially in churches. You can feel the despair of dark times and end of the world theme. The combat is decent. Besides good amount of spells, overall combat system is not the best. The story is very well written, characters are unique and interesting. Unique and well written music that makes you feel the game atmosphre   Overall 7/10
3407	1	a	Inquisitor is a detailed RPG with a riveting storyline based in the medieval period following the infamous black plague. It uses a mix of real world events and common fantasy elements to recreate the era. Fantasy elements include magic, enchanted weaponry, and useful alchemical potions (real world alchemy was actually an endless pursuit to try and create gold by mixing various elements).   One of my favorite historical elements is a mention of the flagellants, a group of christian extremists who repeatedly whipped themselves and inflicted other bodily harm in an attempt to recreate the suffering of Jesus. Of course, the most apparent historical element is the inquisition itself, referring to the persecution of all those who weren't inline with the beliefs of the church. This game is of course not nearly as extreme and vulgar as what actually took place, but I won't go too far in detail, as I don't want to bore you with a history lesson.  So, what's good?  -Leveling system with XP, attributes, skill points -Large variety of spells and skills (all explained by detailed tooltips) -Lots of equipment (character can equip weapon, shield, helm, armor, boots, gloves, belt, two rings, and an amulet) -Challenging combat -Choices with consequences -Good replay value (to try different choices with different consequences) -Immersive world -Non-linear gameplay -Intriguing storyline  What can be annoying?  -Bosses are extremely difficult, to the point where you may have to clear several areas without fighting the bosses, and then go back and try again, and again, clear some other areas, and then try again. Although, it kind of makes sense from a realistic point of view, as most of these are all fabled in the lore to be as such. It's still annoying. -Old school RPG with archaic graphics -No tutorial, which can make it frustrating to figure out how to play, especially if you are not familiar with how these types of games work. -All text, no voice dialogue  What can be viewed either way?  -No flashing marker on your map telling you where to go next, forcing you to actually pay attention to dialogue if you want to complete quests (time to drag out the old notepad). -Character growth in spells and skills is limited by your class choice, forcing you to specialize. While this adds some to the replay value, it doesn't allow one to create that god-like character that can do anything.  In conclusion, this game can be great but is not for everyone.  If your one of those who doesn't like reading, this game may not be for you. If you like games to be easy, this game is likely not for you, as you will have to do some thinking. If you are one of those who can't stand to look at a game if it doesn't have modern graphics, then this game is DEFINITELY not for you.  That said, I think this game is absolutely amazing. I'm sure that if you are an avid RPG gamer like myself who can tolerate the old school style and difficult bosses, you will love it as much as I do. At U.S. $9.99, Inquisitor is a steal.
3409	1	a	The depth and its double-standards of justice kept me going back for more as I pushed further into its curious story to find out who was behind a simple act of malice. I had no idea how 'OK' I was about torturing someone into accepting the conjectured blame the order had cooked up. Even if there wasn't anything left to confess, I wanted to see them scream in pain. If you enjoy stories in your games more than you do gameplay; you should give this game a shot. If you enjoy stories that start of as a bundle of petty missions that eventually turn into more than reality could handle, then give this game 100 hours of your time. And if you happen to be one of those who watched The Borgias with Jeremy Irons, then you should play this game to experience what it's like to be a self-righteousness Inquisitor.
3411	1	a	This game is for the hardcore only. If you enjoyed diablo, you MIGHT like this. This game is MUCH more story driven, with a much more in-depth combat and class system. You choose from 3 classes, Priest,Templar,Thief. All of which are HARD. Play the game on EASY, because even easy is HARD. I highly reccomend it. Only 9 hours in, and i barely scratched the surface.
1585	0	a	Having mixed feelings towards this game. It's not that it's a bad one. Just not well-made. From the creators of the dark, atmospheric, story-driven albeit a bit clumsy adventure Daemonica comes a dark, atmospheric, story-driven Inquisitor… but the RPG part and the duration made the whole clumsiness part exaggerated. Delve deep into the tedium of 1. pixelhunting! 2. stacking on bottles like a hobo junkie 3. collecting scalps 4. lengthy monotonous conversations 5. reeeeally slow walking 6. unskippable “I have to let you go dialogue whenever you accidentally click on your dog 7. spiders that poison you for 5 minutes with about the only remedy of going to the city and heal… and did I mention slow walking? 8. broken balance with easy difficulty being worse off than hard (according to forums)  If you tell me now “but it's a hardcore dialogue-rich RPG, what did you expect?, please don't be like those people who mistake bad game design for a difficulty level. User-friendliness is not something for ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, it's a norm these days, and this game lacks a lot in this department.  Story-wise it's an interesting concept, being an inquisitor, collecting gossip and proof, uncovering crimes against faith — and these heretical rituals are kind of grim and do make you uneasy. I guess I'm about halfway through now, and decided to just use the cheat codes to get through the dungeons without madly running/crawling to the town and back.
1586	0	a	The combat is a slog of just abusing potions against hilariously low RNG odds and the adventuring consists wandering around until obscure quest triggers that aren't logical conclusions from the clues you're given activate to let you progress and hearing PAGES of dialogue that are all the same thing about topics of no importance.  I get the fun of dialogue, I get reading. I don't get peasants having Galt length speeches about every. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. thing.

3413	1	a	 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7d1kBznlSo&amp;feature=youtu.be   Inquisitor: Inquisitor is an old styled RPG from an isometric point of view. You take on the role of an inquisitor of one of three classes, the paladin, thief or priest. You are set upon the world of Ultherst to save it from damnation by rooting out the witch and heretic and banishing evil from the hearts of the innocent. Inquisitor is a fairly simple game with an amazing premise; it really ends up playing out like a detective game of crime solving. You will go and get testimony’s, witnesses, evidence and find the truth behind the conspiracy's and paranoia of the down trodden people of Ultherst and in doing so, discover a dangerous and incredibly evil plot against humanity. The story and setting in Inquisitor is incredible and very unique, I’ve never seen a game quite like this, and it’s got a heavy dark setting with a very gothic overtone and style, beautifully created environments and music that really makes you feel like you are doing god's work. As far as storytelling, the game is stellar, the game truly falters in its execution of its combat, you will constantly need to carry bags full of potions and drink from them constantly just to stay alive, and the combat itself is very monotonous, couple that with the strange design choice of including stamina which you use for any combat action and once depleted you can do nothing and it really takes out the intensity of combat and really becomes more of chore than something you want to do. This is made into an even bigger problem further since the game will have you go through huge dungeons with multiple floors and quickly respawning enemies. You will end up fighting through throngs of enemies just to get to the next Act or finish a side quest and without any satisfaction it gets very challenging to push yourself through to enjoy more of the story. Challenge is also something that bogs the game down, this game is difficult even on easy, enemies will take an insane amount of damage before dropping while you can easily be killed, you'll be saving and loading often in this game and it isn't necessarily because the monsters pose a challenge, but rather that they have a lot of health and you don't. My recommendation for the combat system is to build a range character and use hit and run tactics, and ONLY play on easy. This isn't the kind of challenge that feels good to overcome. It’s really a shame since Inquisitor is a game I would like to see a sequel for; its setting is truly a dark fantasy, complete with torture, paranoia, violent crimes and true evil. I would love to see more of this world or game of a similar setting, Inquisitor really suffers from a very bad combat system that is unfortunately forced upon you as you are expected to do a lot of fighting. It's only $9.99 USD and I rarely see it on sale, if you do, I'd pick it up and check out the story and see how you like the crime solving, otherwise, unless you can get past the combat system, it'll be very hard to justify the price, even if the story is great.   TL/DR; Inquisitor is a very hard (not in a good way) RPG where you play a holy man (out of three available choices) who is asked to find the answers behind the evil plaguing Ultherst and save the souls of the innocent. The premise is dark, grim and gothic, with beautiful music and crafted settings, the game really suffers from a horrible combat system that the game seems to think you'll enjoy because it gives you gigantic dungeons with many floors to go through before you can even think of advancing to the next act. It doesn't help the game is so difficult even on the easiest difficulty, for really no reason. I enjoyed the story, but, it’s tough to recommend. I rarely see it go on sale too, if you do see it pick it up, otherwise spending $9.99 is a tough price for a game you might not play past the first few hours. Oh and be prepared to read, a lot.   -Middle of the Road from Royial
3415	1	a	Great game. 120+ hours of play time. I don't know the last time I got this many hours out of a single player game. Maybe never.  It was a bit rough at the start playing as a priest with hardly any spells and low chance to cast them successfully, but it gets much better. Use plenty of magic seal items at the start (instant magic spell items with 100% success) until your own magic abilities get better. When you get AoE spells much later in the game you will be unstoppable.  The story is very unique compared to other games I've played, and the gameplay is too. It combines investigation with regular RPG elements very well.
3417	1	a	If you like old school style RPGs like Fallout, Arcanum etc, it's maust have for you guys. Powerfull storyline interesting quests etc. 
3419	1	a	I love this game It's not dumbed-down like most modern CRPGs and is a welcome challenge that has the deep atmosphere of games like Divine Divinity and Baldur's Gate. Thank you for this classically gorgeous game with intriguing lore and gameplay :') I highly recommend this game for any gamers such as myself who love classic CRPGs, a challenge, and craves depth.
3421	1	a	Great game. Very old school RPG. No hand holding... anywhere, your going to need to know your RPG, and be expected to... think. Prepare to read, read, and read, hack, hack, shoot, and use potions, and sell old armor, to use new. Save, die, and reload. Just like the old days, its about the story... and while their is a journal, you really need to 'stay' with it, or you will forget the many intriguing and subliminal turns it takes you on. Stop playing at your own risk.
3423	1	a	Totally sick. Underestimated masterpiece
3425	1	a	I played the closed beta to release (so you dont see many game hours on Steam here)... But I loved this game. I never finished it because I was doing a lot of play testing which is slow. This game is like all the greats - Planescape Torment, Baldurs Gate, etc, but with a very unique world and perspective. It is a difficult game, no doubt. Save often. But get it, and enjoy a real RPG like they used to make them. 9/10
3427	1	a	Ok while I do recommend it I do so only for specific types of gamers. If you are OLD SCHOOL this is for you; If you love an intensive reading assignment, lots of things to sift through and the likelyhood you are going to die a lot and the save now save often rule comes to mind, then this is for you. If you are used to ressurecting and trying again, multiple chances, and lots of help guides, then look elsewhere. Enjoy :)
3429	1	a	Great game. Developers please make make udate fo windows 10, game doesnt working on that OS.
1589	0	a	The atmosphere of the game is great but, I feel the rest wasn't executed very well. The writing definitely captured some of the justice, heretic, interrogation theme but, ultimately wasn't very engaging to me.  The gameplay gets a bit repetitive, especially if you have to make multiple trips in certain areas due to equipment breaking or running out of potions. It seems a bit overkill if you have to bring 3 sets of weapons and 2 full pages of inventory filled with potions into one dungeon and you still have to make a 5 minute trip back out to resupply.  Those things said, I only played as a paladin and restarted twice to make stat adjustments. I never made it past the first act as well. I was about to write the review a while ago but, I decided to try to give it some more time. After a few more hours I still didn't make it out of act 1 and it was not worth it to push myself through this game.  All in all it's good for a few hours of mediocre entertainment at ~$2.00 but, I don't think it's worth your time.  
3431	1	a	Torture heretics, burn them on the stake, carry the decomposing bodies of three young girls each in different stages of decomposition, yell at priests, find secrets everywhere, get mad dosh and burn some more heretics just for the sake of it.
3433	1	a	This game was excellent, I will admit the combat was lacklustre and repetive and even dated to be brutally honest. But the story was top notch, And investigating crimes and seeking out heresy, finding leads and the dialogue was 100%. I became thoroughly immersed in this game and I would gladly buy a sequel if they ever made one.
3435	1	a	Great RPG that follows the vein of old games like Baldur's Gate or Fallout, mostly for good and a little for ill. The story and dialog are top notch and even 30 hours in there's more and more to discover all the while getting engrossed in the setting of a medieval but fantasical Europe. Orcs and lizard-men roam the countryside while satanic plots threaten to destroy humanity but a familiar Christian dogma attempts to keep everything in check. The music is also very well done and quite fitting with an amazing variety where you're sure to keep hearing new tracks when coming across new dungeons.  If you have yet to be baptised to the faith of older top down RPGs you may find the combat and skill system a little out of date and you'd be right to think so. Still, once you get your first party member and learn the nuances of the skills and spells you'll be able to completely focus yourself on the games strong points. For just 10 dollars (or less, sale depending) you're more than likely to get your monies worth.
3437	1	a	I enjoyed playing this game.   Setting  The setting of a fantasy inquisitorial christian kingdom felt refreshing. The tone of the game is fairly dark and grim.   Gameplay  Gameplay isn't too complex but takes some figuring out at the start. The game can become a potion chugging fest the further you get into the game. I enjoyed playing the priest class, the focus on spells felt great in my opinion. The user inteface could have been better.   Story  The game has a lot of text, so you'll have to read. What kept me playing was the story. In my opinion it has a bit of a detective-ish feel when you try to find heretics.
3439	1	a	Inquisitor is an unpolished diamond. When playing a game of its genre, I expect it to have a compelling story and an immersive atmosphere. Gameplay always comes second. It certainly has hack&amp;slash elements and it could very well be categorized as such. However, it feels like a true old school rpg to me since its emphasis lies on lore, storyline and mood. You almost feel like you were tossed in this world and have to choose, heavy hearted, for the lesser evil. The devil you know. Or not...
3441	1	a	Fun game, tons tons and i mean TONS of reading. This game is more of a crime investagation than any. But with fighting, decision making that affect all the characters of the game, and good itemization. I would have played it more and still probably will... but all the reading... it's like i am reading a chapter of a book every NPC haha.
3443	1	a	  It's a game that feels and plays like a 90s RPG. Emphasises story, characters and dialog over combat, making the former very good and the latter mediocre.  
3445	1	a	So I must admit this game is pretty hardcore. I also must admit I had to cheat in order to stay alive as a thief.  But!  I love Inquisitor's atmosphere, with it's foggy lands and superstitions. All this writing work really keeps me going! It has quite a unique lore, and for some reason I don't get, the old fashioned design really fits it. I also like some of the musics. This game inspires me!  I don't know if I'll ever be able to finish it, but I'll try my best. It's not every day you get to be a badass inquisitor.
3447	1	a	Cheat the ♥♥♥♥ out of it, and you will probably enjoy it. Try to play it without cheating and it is an exercise in frustration because you need approximately A BILLION ♥♥♥♥ING STAMINA POTIONS.   Great setting, I like the dialog, and the way the world works. But god damn if it is not hard to like.
3449	1	a	You know, the game style is dated, similar to Diablo 2, but it's charming. The choices you make can carry great weight, depending on your playstyle. The game doesn't babysit you and stop you from going places where you might die quite easily either, which I appreciate. It shows the dev team has faith that we're not complete morons and we'll learn from our mistakes, rather than point us away every time. There's some typos in the text, but it really isn't anything game breaking or too distracting. Items can be a little tough to come by, but it makes it that much more awarding. 4 out of 5, really enjoyed it.
3451	1	a	This game was 10 years in development for translation into English so it could be released in North America. It reminds me of the old school RPG gaming and I miss that in today's games.  There is no voice acting in Inquisitor so I hope you like lots of reading because there is allot of it to do.  I didn't play it for a lengthy time as I was getting board reading and reading and reading. However its a very in depth story and they gave every NPC in the game there own personality.  Your character creation screen is limited as to your portrait and you select one of the five or six pre-remade pictures, not that it matters really.  Graphically the game is very pretty and the story is very good but I had a hard time wanting to continue to play as there was to much reading and I tend to drift off when there is that much to do.  Picking up the game for $4.99 or less is a good deal, if your really into this type of gaming and can spend the hours and hours of reading then for $9.99 its worth the price.
3453	1	a	Oh my god It's so good. It took me like three hours to get working and it still isn't displaying correctly but it doesn't even matter.   I've played close to maybe an hour of it so far and I can say it's everything I wanted it to be. The dialogues are ripe with exposition for paragraphs on end, the tone of which is lavishly crafted to be equal parts melodramatic and faustian at once. You're introduced as a detective of sorts, sent to help the church find, accuse and try heretics. The 'bishop' type you are sent to meet tells you about the process of doing so, which I'm sure will be a ♥♥♥♥ing gloriously complicated mechanic that will provide hours of harsh entertainment.   The aesthetic of it is so pleasingly dark, not deppressingly or overwhelmingly so, but very dull green, light brown; beautiful in a dreary sort of way. It's got the feel that Diablo 2 had for me back in the day. In fact that's not a bad comparison. It's like a literary Diablo 2, taking more cues from historical events (like, say, the Inquisition) than high fantasy.   One criticism I might level at it is that tooltips could be more prevalant. I like complicated systems in my games, but I also like to know how to use them. A developer shouldnt play the game for you, but they should at least throw you an instruction manual. But that's it. Even the display issues are given a pass by me, because it's so damn cool.  I might feel compelled to change my opinion once I've played further, but as of now, I've got a thorough erection for this game.
3455	1	a	Inquistor is done in the classic isometric style of great 90's rpg's like Baulders Gate or Plainscape: Torment. With a main questline that allows the player to acutully gather evendence, accuse, prosecute and eventually execute heritic's, witches, satanists and other threaths to the church, Inquistor offers something unique and in some ways twistiedly fun. The lack of a tutorial can make the learning curve a bit steep at the start but if you have played the games I mentioned above then it shouldnt take too long to get used to the sometimes clunky UI and figure out how leveling works ect. The storyline is enguaging and adds to the great enviornemnts and atmospheres that are present within allowing for a decent level of immersion that kept me coming back.   One of the issues I had with the game was its lack of direction given in some of the main and side quests. This might just be due to a bad translation as the game was produced and written in Poland and then later translated to English but it seems to happen often. This can sometimes also be seen in the dialoge with converstiaons sounding odd but beyond that having no real other effects I had noticed. Another feature that could be tweeked is the quest tracking and journal system. It would be nice if you cold add your own notes or in the whole converstiaon with people was recoded if it had rellevence to a specific quest. Due to this I sometimes found it hard to leave the game for a few days and pick it back up where I left off. But if you are willing to put in a bit of effort this game will be well worth the time of fans of the classic isometric style of RPGs.
3457	1	a	I have not played this through, but what i did play, it was genuinely interesting, what the creators were trying to do and did have an element of charm to it.. though this Game is more time consuming than Baldur's Gate, it must be said. I have played this for about 10 hours so far ( and will play more eventually).  Some people will look to this game because it looks like Diablo. Some because of perhaps Baldurs' Gate, in honesty, it is quite disssimilar to diablo, being quite a slow paced game but does share quite a bit in common with Baldurs' Gate, including the intricate detail and the more strategy based combat system; Diablo being a 'hack and slash' allows the character to attack when you click, this does not, and 'commands' the character to attack, making this less of an action game.  Maybe I approached it with too much intertest in the story; and there is Tonnes there, so many people to talk to... some say same thing, like many NPCs in RPGs, but the thing with Baldurs gate with the allignment and need to do things right is here and appears to be quite deep in the chatting system (which again is like Baldurs Gate).  My conclusion for now is this has the makings of being a great game, you,. there are hours(and hours) of material and feels like a decent attempt at a story lead game. Though I think the game could have better done with a more action side too, like diablo and perhaps either the layout been more linear or the world smaller as complication can seem to alienate people, inlcuding me when I have to work; In saying that it is truely great to see something that is different and someone actually trying, and succeding in making something good and diffferent.
3459	1	a	One of the best RPGs of last 10y.  Bringing back the Fallout feel.  It really takes you to a fantastic setting, borderline realistic. and immersion is simply astounding. This product is a clear statement that games are art.  of course it has its downs. it doesn't branch, doesn't offer enough consequences, but the budget to cover that would be huge. I have worked with their staff in testing it, and they provide great support.
3461	1	a	Good story line, but I haven't finished it yet. You get your money's worth in the amount of content there is. The character customization adds replayability to fool around with different builds. Worth getting when it's on sale.
3463	1	a	Had to wait a while for the English translation and some patches to polish the game play but once i took the plunge and started playing i just can't stop playing it - Just have to see where this games richly detailed world takes me. Game play wise it is strictly hard core, old school and tougher than an trolls bum! Not one for the impatient or for those who skip dialogue though: the game contains a novels worth of text.
3465	1	a	This game is not easy at all and thats the beauty of have a page full of potions at all times. Old gritty rpg where you may or may not burn people at the stake. 10/10 would burn people again.
3467	1	a	Love this game, all the nice hard scaling difficulties, you can spend hours in the turtorial trying get it done, absolutely a joy to play, if old school Rpgs are your thing
3469	1	a	If you are a true RPG fan you will like this
3471	1	a	Plays like a cross between Planescape torment and Divine Divinity. Not as good as either. Story is quite mature and lots of reading involved, which may or may not be a good thing depending on how you like your games. A lot of time and dedication went into the making of this game, and it is clearly a work of love by the creators. Buy it. 80 out of a 100 in my opinion.
3473	1	a	Oh, My, Gosh. A Must Buy, for ANY RPG Fan.
3475	1	a	8/10 would burn the heretics again
3477	1	a	Very funny game and different atmosphere.Some things are wrong: 1)THE POINT DISTRIBUTION IS WRONG I NEED TO RETAIN THE PONTS TILL LEVEL 15 TO GET A LITTLE BETTER IN MAGIC... 2) ITAIAN TRANSLATION NEEDED
3479	1	a	Very funny game and different atmosphere.Some things are wrong: 1)THE POINT DISTRIBUTION IS WRONG I NEED TO RETAIN THE PONTS TILL LEVEL 15 TO GET A LITTLE BETTER IN MAGIC... 2) ITAIAN TRANSLATION NEEDED
3481	1	a	:wizard: I love how 'Diablo 2' the game is &amp; the games depth but man this game will put me to sleep~
3483	1	a	This isn't Diablo. This isn't Diablo II, This isn't Baulder's Gate. This is Inquisitor. One of the best isometric RPG's of its genre. If you don't like reading and RP'ing experiences then go play something else. Its a classic oRPG with elements found in other like games.
3485	1	a	Drinking potions simulator :)...really the game needs a serious rebalance; but its very addictive, story and setting are very intriguing, and the gameplay has some nice features like arresting and torturing humans muahaaha
3487	1	a	I would have to say this game delivers in Storyline and that classic RPG, Baldurs Gate kind of feel. However, suffers from a very challenging combat system and lack of active pause feature. These do not detract from this game at all, but the experience would be much more enjoyable if Inquisitor had these features.
3489	1	a	I'm really not sure why this game has such a low Metacritic score. It's an unashamedly 'Baldur's Gate' type old-school RPG with an interesting quest/plot line. Okay the graphics aren't exactly going to make you squirt in your pants but a decent RPG doesn't necessarilly need 'AAA' standard graphics. It's a slow-burner though with instant death to be visited upon the foolhardy wanderer at every turn. I suspect the low score is in part down to people who have rushed to score it after dying at the hands of the first hostile NPC you are likely to meet in the starting villiage. But if you can avoid running into him, and add the two available NPC's in that town to your party before you get to grips with him then you are off and running. There are slight errors in grammar and translation in some of the text but really nothing that will detract from the well laid out depth of storytelling. And the combat CAN seem pretty bland at first. However, it's a perfectly good retro-esque RPG -72%. [get it cheap in the reboot 4.0 bundle on BundleStars]
3491	1	a	I read about a comic books worth of text within the first minute. Then I burned someone.  Game doesn't ♥♥♥♥ around.
3493	1	a	==========  + Arts + Story + Setting + Gameplay + Soundtrack  ==========  - non-user-friendly  ==========  9 \ 10
3495	1	a	Inquisitor is a very old-school take on the diablo 1 / 'Hard RP' RPG type game.  It's got loads of text, tons or reading to do to understand what the heck's going on, but it immerses you right in the world.  You are (theoretically) the arm of god, pardoned for a crime, and sent to a small village to look into some strange occurances. You have a wide latitude of juristiction, and are expected to gather evidence, point fingers, and (again, theoretically), figure out what's truly happening in the world, and do something about it.  ... That said, you could just as easily (probably more easily) abuse your position, blame the wrong people, and sentence them to imprisonment, torture, or death.  You will also be required to kill a veritable bucketload of monsters that plague the countryside, delve into dungeons, gather supplies and armourments, and (likely) gather a group of like minded people to help you on your quest (for good or evil, as the case may be).  If you like diablo 1, but found the story &amp; world-space way too simple, Or you liked arcanum, and found the world too hopeful &amp; bright, You might just like this game.  The world is full of that 'old-school' religious oppression, the combat systems unforgiving, and the story heavy and dark.  I rate is 8/10.
3497	1	a	Very old school, very fun. Hits you right in the nostalgia.
3499	1	a	Havent played an old scholl RPG for a long time. This one was reason i start playing and realy worths the try.
3501	1	a	Cool game if u like rpg's like diablo and baldurs gate its worth a try thumbs up!
3503	1	a	This is a game that you really want to like, but at the same time hate it with the power of 300 foremans grill. It is a diffcult mistress as she punish you for every misstep you make but she rewards you when you make good. What I'm trying to say, is that this game is HAAARRD. It will make you want to slam your keyboard against the deck. I like this game and I hate it at the same time. Bottomline is, that you if have no patince (like me) be prepare for game over. A lot. It is a good game here but you will get mad at it.
3505	1	a	Like it so far, but I think i've turned casaul. Is it normally this hard?
3507	1	a	Combat is kind of odd. Pace is fairly slow. If you want a quiet version of Diablo with more Roleplay this might be your thing.
3509	1	a	Inquisitor is a old-school RPG.There is lots of text to read, maps to search and npc's to talk.But it is have a different then other RPG games, there is no clue for missions.You must find own your own your way.Kind a good game but most of people dont like it because this game so hard.
3511	1	a	A good game that does not let you down along the way. It is a steady ride all to the end.  Although, there should be more impacts on what you do and whom you talk to in the game... with all the big warnings at the beginning of the game, I think the designers should have focused more on that than hack'n'slashing.  The game genre is situated between a role-playing (like Arcanum) and an action-adventure like diablo. It is decent enough to try at least once for fans of both genre.  I recommand that you buy this game if you are a fan of role-playing games like Arcanum or action-adventure games like diablo/Dungeon Siege, especially at the low low price on Steam.
3513	1	a	Meh. There are some fun things about this game, but the combat system and difficulty curve are just awful.
3515	1	a	.
3517	1	a	If wordy detail doesn't put you off, or perhaps even entices you then you've come to the right place.  Amazing value and depth for the modest price tag, clearly a labour of love.  Sometimes frustrating trying to work out what to do next, but not so bad that one would abandon all hope of being able to finish it (plus there's always Google!).  I'm 16 hours in and enjoying it, though it's fairly deep it isn't difficult to play once you get an hour or two into it.  Recommended for old school players and those wanting more Dante than Dungeons &amp; Dragons.
1594	0	a	While there is nothing wrong, in and of itself, with the concepts behind this game, to say that they have been poorly executed is frankly apparent.   Inqusitor, when I started, gave me high hopes, but the hiccups began apparent within a few hours of play.  My first quest was to slay some giant bats to please teh guards, who would then let me inside.  That took me nearly forty minutes to complete a quest that should've taken ten. And if the first quest is long, boring, and requires you to walk around in empty space, hunting down every last enemy, then you have done something wrong.  While the concept of actually being inquisitive, performing basic detective work to hunt down the evil in towns was a brilliant idea, I was unable to get very far into it, having only played about an hour. The reason I stopped will be explained later.  So while I was out and about killing bats, I discovered treasure. 'Aha!' I thought, 'Basic gear that any first rank guy can wear! How wonderful, perhaps this game is salvageable!' And then after closer examination, I found that the gear in question could not be worn by anyone below level seven. This is beyond stupid. All treasure and gear must be levveld to the expectations of the level of progression that the player should be at by the time he or she gets there.  Giving level seven gear to a level one player, when you do not expect the player to be anywhere near that level, is a horrible design, regardless of where you find it. So, lacking any storage for this treasure, I prompty got rid of it by selling it. Now the market system is pretty good, with coin flowing freely and not feling too overwhelmed by ridiulous prices.  But there was another problem. Care to guess?  Over leveled equipment sold at the start of the game. You cannot use anything that is sold to you unless you are level 7. Proper design is to have the inventory of the blacksmith update as progress is made. This flaw proved to be extremely frustrating later.  So after some basic examination into murders, and some questioning of townspeople, I was told by a villager that he had been paid good gold to kill me, and so he pulled out a weapon to do just that. Which is where the second flaw became apparent.  Unbalanced enemies. In any good game the challange must scale to the player. Not so hard that the player can't win, but not so easy they become bored. Were in not for the timely intervention of the local guard, I would have been slain.  During the fight, I ran into yet another problem. Breaking weapons. Now this is NOT problematic. Provided of course that the weapon displays a stat that SAYS IF IT IS GOING TO BREAK. The weapon did not, and when it did break, I was left completely defenseless.   So without a weapon, and the bandit having a knife I was too low level to use, I set off to buy a weapon.  Only, again, to discover I was too weak to use ANY WEAPON SOLD IN STORES, LEAVING ME COMPLETELY USELESS.  At thsi point, I quit. Poor level design and balancing has completely ruined this game, which is a pity because it showed so much promise from the mechanics alone.  Do not buy this game.
1595	0	a	Extremely poor balancing early game. I'm not asking to start out like a dragonborn badass, but this is ridiculous.  I chose a paladin knight as my character on medium difficulty. I try to kill the starter bat creatures on the first quest and can only kill one before im out of stamina and half dead. The fact that they paralyze you every other hit also adds insult to injury. I wonder if they even playtested it, the most frustrating 4 dollars I have ever spent.  It has a very interesting universe and a very nostalgic isometric view of things,but the stat design of this game is currently broken to the point were it is not even playable.
3519	1	a	 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUMkcBctE7c   Inquisitor has organ music.
3521	1	a	In this game I found I'm not that good in english stills a pretty solid game for all old school rpg lovers  8/10
1598	0	a	I would have trouble playing this game even if it used D&amp;D lore...Slow pace a lot of walking. While the depth of story appears to be there I couldn't hang on long anough to find out.  But for $1.99 you might have a different oppion.
1599	0	a	Honestly I am sorry, but this game was absolutely terrible for many reasons but I will try to hard boil it to 5. (Don't want to read them all? I made a summary at the bottom :3)  1. The Gameplay: Four words: Crappy Version Of Diablo  2. The Story: Honestly the theme of this story is very well founded, It would seem like a great idea for a book or a movie. But VIDEO GAME?... eh maybe not.  3. Lack of Playable Character Diversity: This game's selection of characters was, as best as I can say it, incomplete. Ok you got a warrior, a priest, and a thief... Then the author just dropped it there. Seriously!? How about including something like a witch (or warlock) or maybe an unarmed fighter like a monk (or something similar). The roster looked like the author made it to the thief and just said 'screw it that's fine'.  4. Vocal: Or should I say lack thereof. This game was like a silent movie the whole way through. I don't mind reading but I do like to hear a voice behind the text. Plus some of the times you talk to people the text is like 10 or 15 lines long so some vocals would help there.  5. Difficulty: Immensely difficult. Too much for an RPG. I don;t mind and even LIKE a little difficulty. But this game pretty much just throws your butt into the middle of the road and just says 'Ok you're here, you're on your own; have fun'. You have no idea where you 're supposed to go after the first place you start in. Plus the monsters are so difficult that even on easy I couldnt make it past the Necromancer in the Crypt (Can't recall his bloody name right now). And with no autosave, you die and forgot to save for like 2 hours you're screwed.  To Make this short, Its Diablo 2 with the story, gameplay, PC (PC=playable character) roster, and vocals cranked down to zero and blown up with a Holy Hand Grenade, and the difficulty cranked up to bloody 11. I got it on a special and It wasn't even worth the minuscule amount I paid.
1600	0	a	This game starts off really cool, the atmosphere and the whole middle-ages religious conspiracies are very intriguing (think The Name of the Rose). Alas, the plot goes downhill (basically off the cliff) fast, with extremely repetitive plotlines and quests, boring 'investigations/trials' (which are usually nothing more than fetch quests or pixel hunts then a multiple choice quiz at the end), obvious twists and the ending is just the worst.   Then there's the combat, which while when you are at the right level is ok, it is the grindiest grindfest ever. You will spend painful hours grinding just to get to be able to walk around the next area without getting one hit killed. And not to mention the horrendous stamina mechanic.  That being said, the music is amazing. Shame it's wasted on such a letdown of a game. 
3523	1	a	Admittedly it is a very long game, I have played for an hour and have barely progressed, such is the like with RPG's, but it is very much worth it, brings back memories of Diablo II :)
1601	0	a	I hate this game. I didn't expect much out of the graphics but somehow they managed to look worse than the screen shots and the animations are just plain ugly. I really like the idea of this game but the presentation is so bad that I just can't get into it. Oh and for a game with this much reading they should have made the font less annoying to look at. I'm more mad that they wasted the idea rather than that I wasted my 5 bucks. ♥♥♥♥ this ugly ♥♥♥ game.
3525	1	a	Good game with bad writing. Get it on sale and it is worth it.
1604	0	a	Beautifull artwork, enjoyable storyline, poorly thought-out combat design. Particularly irritating side-quest design. Example: You've talked to every named NPC in town except one. That last NPC offers a side-quest. Now you have to talk to all of the named NPC's once again to glean information about the quest. Imagine having to do this for every single quest; Compounding irritation as you walk across town over and over and over again. This is required for every side-quest I had encountered in the first town.   Combat mechanics are just as irritating. The stamina stat exists solely to enforce spamming of both stamina and mana potions. Spell casting requires stamina and mana. Being struck by enemies consumes stamina. Attacking enemies consumes stamina. Stamina only regenerates out of combat, if you are not moving. You need to stand still and essentially not play the game for several minutes after each combat if you wish to regenerate stamina without potions. You can't walk back to town, or pick up loot, you can only do nothing.   Potions are relatively cheap, which is good. However, you can not bulk puchase potions. Each sizeable combat scenario, or dungeon, will have you consuming tens of potions. These are purchased from the abundant vendors by dragging and dropping items across inventory screens one item at a time. Enjoyable gameplay mechanic, right? BTW, your companions will need a plethora of health potions too. Fun!   TL:DR. I like the idea of this game, the art is pretty, but the core mechanics are far too irritating for me to recommend it.
1605	0	a	No customizable keyboard, no way to pause the game with my laptop... sorry, but why do you put so much effort in such a game if it's to forget the gamer who paid for it? I really, really wanted to love it though.
1606	0	a	I normally don't write these little blurbs for games I've barely scratched the surface on, but this game is an exception. While I'm sure the game is incredibly rich and deep, there is a limit I have for presentation in the modern age. When the controls and flow are as good as they are on the classic standard-setters Baldur's Gate 1 and 2, there is no excuse for a game that plays as sloppy as this now. My apologies to the dev, but I uninstalled after one hour.
3527	1	a	Spawned Went to the church to preach about ♥♥♥♥ and how god is accepting of it Taxed the townfolk Went to the place of execution Talked to some people along the way Didn't read the dialog  Massive jerk to everyone   10/10 Would Preach Again
1607	0	a	Only masochist need apply...
1608	0	a	Please don't get this game. I don't care how cheap it is. If you're like me, you will be pulled in by the 'old-school' nature, the art, and the story. Sadly, that's all the game has going for it. The story and setting are great, including the art. However, if that's all I wanted then I would read a book or watch a movie. A game is ALSO about gameplay and this game has terrible and infuriating gameplay.   The investigation is the best part of gameplay, but you never have any clues other than just talk to everyone. Plus, sometimes you feel you have enough evidence to convict someone, but the game doesn't. So you have to continue just randomly wandering around and talking to people until you finally hear what you need to hear to be able to accuse the person.   Combat is the WORST. It can't make up it's mind if it wants to do Diablo-style gameplay or Baldur's Gate so it ends up combining the worst of both and ending up worse than almost any game I've played. You will die - A LOT. Not because you're not using a good strategy, but because the game is exremely unbalanced. Combat is terrible, yet there are so many dungeons in the game that you must wade through that it becomes so tedious that I finally just had to stop. There is NOTHING good about combat.  Towards the middle of Act II, I did something that I've rarely done in my 25+ years of gaming - I cheated. Not since using the Game Genie on Battletoads or the infamous Konami code on Contra have I had to do this. Sadly, there are no good cheats so I just gave myself lots of EXP and maxed out attributes and hoped that would be enough for me to just breeze through the tedious dungeons so I could just finish the game. Well, I got as far as Act III and then there were the number of dungeons in Act I and II times 10! I got so close to the end, but I just couldn't do it any longer. I quit - I watched the ending on Youtube and will uninstall it and hope to never look at it again.  Pros:  -Story -Setting -Art -Parts of the investigation gameplay  Cons: -Unclear goals/lack of direction -Combat - which could be overlooked if there wasn't so much that was required -Dungeon design - beautiful, but huge and since combat is terrible, they're just tedious. I got lost in several of them because I just didn't know what to click randomly to open the way. -Did I mention the terrible click, wait, and die combat? -Unbalanced enemies -Combat, Combat, Combat, COMBAT
1609	0	a	The atmosphere and story are enjoyable, but the combat is just terrible. It's very slow and mostly involves you chugging potions like you are addicted to them. I've played Diablo, where you have to chug potions fairly often as well, and this is worse than that. Much. Much Worse. If you do get this, I suggest playing it on easy so that you can get the fighting out the way faster and get to the parts of the game that are okay.
1610	0	a	I want 15 minutes of my life back. This game was, while somewhat hilarious to watch in action, absolutely terrible. If you can sit through horrible everything, it may get better farther in, but it sets a terrible first impression with terrible voice-acting, animations, story, and worst of all horrible gameplay. While it was a Diablo-Like, it felt more tedious than any other I've played. If you're a masochist, I recommend this game, otherwise please stay away.
1611	0	a	What it lacks in smooth gameplay it more than makes up for in pointless conversations
1612	0	a	Game seemed decent until I got to the first dungeon. Lots of grinding on the way, finally get in there and it's LOOOOONG. The difficulty levels in this game change without warning. You'll be having an ok time one second and then out of nowhere 3-4 goblin shamans will start spamming wall of flame and take out your whole party within literally one second. You can't control your party members. They run blindly into combat and chase fleeing enemies right into enemy lines.  If you get poisoned you pretty much have to leave the dungeon and walk all the way back to town for a healer. This will happen every time you see a spider.  Finally I decided to just use console commands to make my dude OP so i could at least enjoy the story.  Nope. Still the same problem. You get one second killed even when you're double the normal level for the dungeon you're in. I'm sorry, I tried to like this game, but I'm out.
1613	0	a	Good story. Horrible gameplay.
1614	0	a	I agree with you Cyn0sure.
3529	1	a	I can't wait to loose my job and spend some time with this game it seems that good...
1620	0	a	So you may have noticed that this game boasts a one-hundred hour playtime and I've only played this for about an hour before reviewing it. It might not make me qualified to give it a full review, but then again first impressions count for something, so kiss my ♥♥♥.

1621	0	a	If you can endure the terrible ui (oh my eyes), if you can accept tons of bugs, if you can quit then enter the game again and again just becasue the memory leak, if you just want to read a detective novel, you can chooes this game.
1622	0	a	This could be one of the worst action RPG's I have ever seen. Let me start by saying the movement in the game feels like im playing something from the 90's. The combat is clunky at best. I'm just glad I got it cheap because this was a complete waste of about 20 minutes of my time.   Uninstall, and off to look for something a little more enjoyable!
3531	1	a	Amazingly well written!
3533	1	a	A hate letter from 1998 filled with inexplicable design choices, such as removing control of your mouse cursor for 60 seconds when relatively common enemies cast spells on you. Overall, this game is aggressively annoying.
3535	1	a	This is a great game. If you liked Diablo, Baldurs Gate type rpg's then you'll love this. Very well made in-depth game that has that olde' rpg feel.
3537	1	a	The game where everyone forgets to introduce themselves... lol  Many people already sayd that this game is not good, but it's also good. Bad graphics, stiff and a little broken. Also annoying that maps has not a faint idea of waypoints.  BUT, there´s something really good in this game that I can't quite put the finger on. Something in the dirty air reminds me of The Whitcher (best rpg), and the inquisition context plus the ramifications offered by the chose class has some appeal too. Mechanics are accetable, fun to loot and sensible powers... makes me imagine what it could be with more artworking. Hope this isn't dead.
3539	1	a	This is one of the most rewarding RPG games of the past years. The writing is great and will keep you on your toes. This game does not hold you by the hand wich makes exploring fun and rewarding. The difficulty is very high and this game requires a lot of patience. but if you are a true RPG lover that doesnt mind older graphics this is a must
3541	1	a	Compared to other posters, I haven't gotten that far. But in the little bit of time I've played I've arrested heretics, tortured them, and condemned them to death. Granted this could've possibly messed up the game, but oh well, I'm a cleric on a mission for the Mother Church, and they confessed after many hours of torture.  Be prepared for a difficult campaign. This game is intense, and is very HARD....especially compared to those triple-A titles passing for RPGs today. Those games are a cakewalk. This...this is a nightmare. :shudders:  There is a lot of reading involved, so if you don't like to read, sorry. Also, if you don't read everything you come across, you'll find that you missed important information and now you're stumbling along blind without a clue as to what to do next. (I did this...and the quest objectives are of no help at all)....  Also, if you don't grind just right, and level your skills just right...well, apparently the Mother Church was wrong in sending you out. You obviously ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off God somewhere...because you'll be dead in a ditch somewhere, and the people won't even have the common courtesy to come along and give you a decent burial. How about that for a bunch of heretics??  10/10 would find everyone a heretic.
1664	0	a	I really am enjoying the story of the game but at alot of points in the game it is basically a really boing walking simulator so I do not recommend this game.   Accidently Reviewed
3543	1	a	Terrible graphics Terrible port Terrible script Terrible voice acting Terrible gameplay  One of the best video games ever made
3545	1	a	I wish there was a one thumb up, one thumb down rating; or a shoulder shrug or something for somewhere in-between a 'Yes' or 'No' Recommendation for these Steam-game Ratings.  RECOMMENDED - for the actual game experience: fantastic. NOT RECOMMENDED - for the awful PC technical port: horrible.  Before I actually even get into what an outstanding actual gem of a game itself, let's start right up front with this:  *****WARNING!************  *****BUYER BEWARE!*****  While Deadly Premonition is a unique + outstanding game, it is such a crime that this game is riddled with technical disaster after technical disaster here on the PC. In terms of technical disasters on the PC, this is right down there with the likes of Bully PC version + Dark Souls PTD PC. While Dark Souls: PTD was at least very functional before even modding, Deadly Premonition is absolutely NOT. This is a very basic PC port, lacking of many of the typical PC features we're accustomed to. First off: the game is locked in 720p, so nevermind any sort of 1080p support. Don't expect any sort of fancy graphics bells + whistles officially, either. Durante's DPFix Mod is going to be a must for PC gamers here, if they have any sort of higher-end monitors + graphics cards; especially if they want to bump the resolution past 720p + even make this aging game look a bit more modern.   Also, the game has crazy-issues with crashing to the desktop (CTD) frequently. You might want to even run a LAA (Large Address Awareness) program to make the game force using 4GB of RAM (since it runs even more horribly, without it), since this game has performance issues where it'll begin at 60 FPS (frames per second) when you start, eventually winding up - slowly, but surely - to a crawl. And if the game hasn't hit a crawl yet and crashed, give it time - it likely will. Saving constantly for most gamers anytime you get a chance will likely be a must.  While I did not try using KB-mouse, the game was a console-game: so, it was built around a gamepad. While you can change the controls configuration in the game's sart-up config/splash-screen for the gamepad, you're better off not doing so - b/c some keys might not even function properly, if moved elsewhere.   ****END OF BUYER BEWARE SECTION***  Now, onto the actual game itself...  What do you get when you cross an open-world game, a surreal David Lynch movie/TV show, survival-horror games (Resident Evil + Silent Hill series), and numerous brutal detective movies involving ritualistic murders (i.e. the movie Seven)? You get Deadly Premonition, one of the strangest, odded, weirdest, unique + most interesting games of this era. If any game has 'cult classic' written all over it in this era, this game would certainly easily fit the bill. Also, this game is a flawed-gem + an absolute diamond in the rough in numerous ways, if I've ever seen one.  The story + plot goes like this: Francis 'York' Morgan (who the player is, BTW) is a FBI Agent that comes to the small town of Greenvale, in an attempt to try to solve a bunch a murders occurring from what looks to be a serial killer. I don't want to spoil too much more + go off into the deep end here, as this is just the tip of the iceberg with this game's story, plot + characters; since this stuff should be experienced by the player, first-hand.  And boy, are there characters in this game! Most of the characters in this game do have something that make them stick-out in their own way, as either unique, bizarre, different, hilarious, ridiculous, or God knows what. The colorful cast of characters is always interesting + intriguing: for example, the lead 'York' talks to himself a lot, and refers to someone named 'Zach'; and there is a character that's filthy rich, wearing a gas mask and having his assistant speak in rhyme and poetically. Characters don't get often as unique, interesting, eccentric, hilarious (whether intentional, not intentional, or who knows on some occassions) than often what Deadly Premonition has on display here.   The story + plot are also no stranger from this type of insanity, madness and colorful-ness, as well. While the plot starts off with a typical detectives are out to 'catch the serial killer theme,' it doesn't take long to eventually graduates into something much more weird, interesting, strange, unique, bizarre - and then eventually go way off into the deep end, by the time the game finally finishes. Gamers will no doubt be replaynig the game; looking at an analysis online (or two, or three, or more); and having debates with their friends about things they couldn't figure out + things that are purposely left hanging ambiguously.  The controls and gameplay feels like it's right out of other classic survival-horror games. Think of the control-pad approach for Resident Evil 4 (especially since you can't move when you aim) - and you have the right idea. Combat always feels like it should with a controller: it feels solid. Areas often have their own 'Nightmare' version of an area, which feels like it's plucked right out of a Silent Hill game. There are even QTE (Quick-Time Events) in this game here and there, though this game doesn't really hammer you over the head with them, unlike some other games (i.e. Fahrenheit AKA Indigo Prophecy).  Players, by performing main-quests and side-quests, can make money - all so that they can buy more guns, melee weapons, ammo, med-kits, and other things to keep them on their journey Some quests, they can only be taken during a certain time of day - so, you might miss quests if you don't do them where they're placed in a game's Chapter or during a certain time of day. This could cause fans to replay the game, to see and experience more on an actual replay of the game. Quests varying from racing to get someone or something to another area; playing darts on a board; to just talking to NPC's and trying to get information out of them. That just doesn't tip the iceberg here, of what this game has on offer - as the game is constantly keeping the player immersed into the game, the world, the story, and especially the characters.  The game certianly lacks a lot of polish, in many areas. Sometimes, the game's sound effect doesn't sound strong, when hitting an enemy with a weapon. Sometimes, the dialogue isn't that juicy or great; while other times, it's fantastic. The quality of the graphics are nothing to write home about here, as it looks like a game that maybe should've been released on the PC years ago and/or this new version should've been updated with modern resolution support (1080p and above) + graphical features. Worst of all - as I've already stated, this game is an absolute technical mess, in terms of how this PC port was handled.  Deadly Premonition is a flawed-gem + a cult-classic, unfortunately riddled with having of the worst PC ports that I've ever seen - but it's an absolutely unforgettable experience, once you can everything in working order...hopefully, for the time being. It's a great gaming experience, when it's working. An experience that, per playthrough, likely will take the player 15-20 hours or so - if we're not counting all the crashes, frustrations, and other technical blunders that might cause the spike in the time-played. According to Steam, I had around 32 hours with this, if you count all of that madness; while the game itself had me clocked in around almost 20 hours. Unfortunately, this great game is brought down quite a bit because it's unfortunately riddled with an abysmal F-grade of a technical PC port - to the point that even mods can't even close to fix most of this game's technical mess. Even the absymal PC port couldn't stop me from trying to finish this fantastic game.  Game Experience = A PC Port = F. FINAL Overall Grade = C.
3547	1	a	Its core greatness cannot be stopped,  No matter how much the rate of frames dropped. Though not abundant, extras are nice,  I'd say it is worth the asking price.  So says Mr. Stewart!
3549	1	a	This is the type of game that will only excite people who get into the characters and story. In concept the game itself is fantastic, but technical flaws narrows the overall appeal to an already niche title. I loved the game, but I feel it's only fair to recommend it with some caveats.  It's a murder mystery with quirky characters. They give the game a lot of heart and fans of the TV show Twin Peaks and 80s pop culture should find some things to love. The juxtaposition of horror and comedy is something special.  Basically this is an open world survival horror game where you drive around and look for clue to further the story. If I remember correctly there are 50 side quests as well. I really liked that many prizes for completing side quests were useful (unlike many open world games). You normally travel by car which is a jarring, experience. The car controls very poorly and has a blind spot where the frame of the windshield is. Opening the large map takes up half the screen and does not display all of the information that the menu map does. As bad as it all sounds, you do get used to it, and fast travel options open up with the right side quest completion. I would say the driving was my biggest peeve.  The combat is familiar to anyone who has played Resident Evil 4 or Dead Space. The controls are a stiffer than expected in the previously mentioned games and aiming is not as easy. There is some required melee combat and all weapons break after a few uses. I was ok with this considering that it's a survival horror game. I never was weaponless during my playthrough. there is not a lot of enemy variation though so be ready to hear 'noooo i dooon't want to dieeee!' about over 9000 times.  Though Deadly Premonition still contains a fair amount of jank, it only adds to the wealth of charm within. The end result is a ridiculously original masterpiece that hearkens back to an era where the gaming landscape had more room for wildly imaginative budget games, a far cry from the abundance of focus tested blockbusters that are prevalent today.   I love whistling this theme!         YouTube™ Video:  Deadly Premonition (Whistle Theme)&nbsp;
3551	1	a	One of the oddest videogames I've ever played. Despite having virtually no production-value and the lack of polished gameplay, it manages to stand on the strength of its gripping murder-mystery story, its weird and wonderful freakshow of characters and how aware of its own campiness it is. It's an experience like no other that I can recommend solely for that reason.  Only true downside is the PC port. It’s awful. Downloading fan-made fixes and messing with .exe properties isn't much fun. A patch that Rising Star Games promises is on the way may fix this, but for now, just take note.  Overall, even with the shoddy PC job, its one of the most memorable games in recent memory. Highly recommended if you're into games that are a little out-there.
3553	1	a	If I ever wrote a book with a video game topic the title would be '1 Video Game You Must Play Before You Die' and Deadly Premonition would be the subject. In it you would find countless of analysis of the many citizens of Greenvale, a complete study of the main characters quirks and flaws, how to make your own Sinner's Sandwich and why you always should keep your suit pressed and clean.  Hell, I would probably end up writing a sequel. There is just so much going on in this game that one book simply couldn't content everything that needs to be said about Deadly Premonition.   There are lot of great games out there, but in my view there is only about 3 games that have ever gone far and beyond and pushed what a game really is capable of being. A game that changes the way you will look at games. A game that makes you realize what a fantastic medium games can be, if it's utilized for more than simply being another entertainment form to ultimately make you pass time. A game that ruins gaming.  Deadly Premonition is all that. It's impossible to describe exactly what it is that makes it such a fantastic game. Most people will only shake their heads and it's like trying to describe a miracle to people who never witnessed one.
3555	1	a	The squirrels have public domain monkey sounds. I repeat. The squirrels have public domain monkey sounds.
3557	1	a	There is three types of games: - The good ones - The bad ones - Deadly Premonition
3559	1	a	Well, if you are one those people who can enjoy this masterpiece probably you already own this game, I was waiting for this for a long time I have no consoles so I couldn't play it before, I pretty excited when they announced it for steam, I preordered it without much thought, and when game was released it was pretty much unplayable for me, I can say it was worst port I have ever played, well I don't really care about resolution but when console port has no controller support that's just terrible, not to mention it crashed every 5 minutes or so, so I decided to wait, not long after Durante of NeoGAF famous for his dark souls fix has released resolution fix for this game and after that some dedicated users made custom icons for controller and somewhat support of for pads via third party softs. Then there was word that devs were planning to release patch to fix all this mess, and they really did after some time. So it's been a month already after the games release till I could play this game but it was really worth the wait, I was already hyped for this game for a long time but it turned out to exceed my expectations like 10 times, and after this patches game was fully playable with no crashes, controller support and thanks to durante with desirable custom resolutions. I played many games this generation but there were only two games that brought me that sense of excitement and joy of gaming that I had only as a child, first game was Dark Souls, and I thought I wouldn't enjoy anything else like that until second DS game was released, well now as I write this I have completed this game 100% and can safely say that it's definitely is in my top 10 games of all time if not in top 5, it just makes me sad that this masterpiece in not very successful saleswise compared to mainstream 5-7 hour meaningless soulless shooters, but I do hope that as gaming attracts more and more mature audience and is slowly becoming as mainstream as movies, there will be time that developres can take the risks and make games such this one without any fear of failing.
3561	1	a	A superb game for people who enjoy Twin Peaks, murder mysteries and unique game design, not to mention charm, ambition, complexity and creativity that most modern games simply lack.   The PC port has some issues, but generally runs well for me and the issues it does have can be fixed with a few forum/google searches.  It's a unique game, one that any player who enjoys great games should experience.
3563	1	a	Every generation of video games has a set of titles that completely flies under most gamers’ radar. Games such as Killer 7 and Snatcher are among those that fall into the elusive, Cult Classic category. See, a Cult Classic game is one that hasn’t really been met with commercial success but has garnered a dedicated fanbase despite that fact. Now, as a lowly gamer I can’t do much about these games and I wish more people actually played them, but I’ll be damned if I don’t do my part to at least spread awareness about games that I think deserve much more attention than they are currently getting. One of these games is Deadly Premonition: The Director’s Cut. Deadly Premonition: The Director’s Cut is an HD remake of the same game released in 2010 on Xbox 360 and PS3(Japan Only). The new game sports updated visuals, move support and some new DLC, scenarios and an extended ending. It would be hard to categorize this game into one specific genre; if I had to try I would say that Deadly Premonition is an open world third–person murder-mystery survival horror adventure game.To play Deadly Premonition, you need to approach it with an open mind. This is not your typical run-of-the-mill video game. No, instead this game has some of the worst visuals and controls you’ll ever encounter, not to mention the new HD remake has some framerate issues as well. But do not let this deter you from the game as absolutely none of that matters when you’re playing it. Deadly Premonition follows Agent Francis York Morgan, an FBI agent investigating the murder of a young woman in the quaint little town called Greenvale. York (As he likes to be called) takes the case due to the mysterious and intriguing M.O of the killer – red seeds are always found near the body of the victims. York has to work together with the denizens of Greenvale to help bring in the bad guy and restore order to the once peaceful town. Sounds like your average detective plot right? Well, it couldn’t be further from that. Without getting into too many spoilers, the plot takes numerous twists and turns that send you on a journey of self-discovery and has you second guessing what the truth is.The real hook of Deadly Premonition comes from the charm its characters and environments exude. Everything and everyone is bursting with personality. Agent York for example has a special friend named Zach; what makes Zach so special is that no one else can see him or knows about him besides York, even if he talks to Zach in front of another character. York constantly talks to him in his head throughout the game, and you’re always wondering if Zach is real or just some imaginary friend. York also seems to be very knowledgeable about movies. When driving around in your car York will often talk about various movies with Zach such as the classics Tremors and Goonies. Another example would be the Deputy Sheriff, Emily Wyatt, who bears a striking resemblance to the actor Naomi Watts, for no apparent reason. The town of Greenvale feels very homey and you often feel like you’re in an episode of Everwood. I think Access Games really nailed the look and feel of Greenvale.As mentioned before, Deadly Premonition is an open world game of sorts. The game has a timer for each day and main objectives have to be completed within a certain time frame. The main objectives push the story forward and this is usually where the survival horror aspect comes into play. These sections have you exploring linear levels gunning down hordes of creepy enemies in classic Resident Evil 4 over the shoulder style. While these sections do little to scare you, they are entertaining enough to keep things moving forward. York can use a multitude of weapons ranging from his handgun to breakable melee weapons such as a pipe or spade.You can partake in numerous activities and interact with various NPCs in the game. You could, for example, spy on one of the officers while they’re having supper in their apartment. I kid you not, you can literally look into their window and stalk them and watch them do completely mundane things like eat or sit on a couch. But that is where the real beauty of Deadly Premonition comes in. It is then up to you to explore and find these gaming gems, and trust me some of them will have you in stitches from laughing so much. There are also numerous side missions that are given to you by certain NPCs; they are not easy to find as some NPCs are only active during certain times of the day – you have to be sure to talk to them at that time or you might miss out. The fact that those NPCs go about their daily lives independent of you, the player, really makes the game feel alive.The game has some catchy tunes and the voice acting is particularly good at capturing each character’s unique personality. The same can’t be said about the sound effects, though. The graphics are really bad. This game looks like it was made in the PS 2 era, even with the updated graphics, but the bad graphics give the game a certain extra charm. If you are open-minded enough I promise you will have a one-of-a-kind experience that you will not soon forget. The PC release though, has its fair share of problems, including poor performance, and a resolution locked at 720p. It’s a bit of a bad console port, to be honest – though one wonders if this adds to the charm. Never before have I experienced such an awful, weird but utterly amazing game. This game really is so bad, it’s good. Overall 7/10.
3565	1	a	Is the voice acting bad?  Yes. Is the gameplay bad? Yes (for the pc port). Are the graphics bad? Equal to a 2006 game. Does it have replay value? Yes. Is the story great? Yes. Will this leave lasting memories? Yes. Is this one of my favorite games? Definitely.   Verdict:  Best crime/survivor/horror ever/10  (Plays like the old Resident Evils or Silent Hills)
3567	1	a	let's get started...  Good thigs about this video game: 1. Main story is a masterpiece full of mystery and weird things. (Greenvale town is a strange place) 2. The characters are so spectacular you can find crazy guys, tough guys even a horny Woman who try to seduce you. 3. Side quest mission are so funny.  Bad things about this video game: 1. The graphics looks like 128-bit era.  2. Bad really bad pc port sometimes crash over and over again and you need to restart your computer.  3. Only 720p is this a joke ?? but don't worry you can solve it with DPfix.  So if you like video games like resident evil or similars (survival horror games) I can tell you this you will enjoy this one just like me off course you must have a lot of patience because you know the glitches about this game can be a pain in the ♥♥♥ so I hope this little review may help you
3569	1	a	Ohh my fahcking GAWD, I did it, I actually did it, I FINISHED THE GAME. Somehow someway after NUMEROUS crashes, freezes, and playing 99.99% of the game with what I didn't know was bugged out aiming, I fahcking did it! I think this game is mesmerizing but first a few questions to determine if Deadly Premonition is right for you!  Do you enjoy quirky games? Do you like the TV show 'Twin Peaks'? Do you enjoy games that are rough around the edges?  I'd say, if you answered yes to 2 of those questions you should definitely find a way to play this game. It has a great storyline, funny albeit intriguing dialouge, decent gameplay and an absolutely fantastic OST. However be warned this game can be a FAHCKING nuisance due to the terrible programing/coding that was implemented especially for the PC version.   Keep in mind that this game has a BOATLOAD of problems but it is also a better experience than most 'AAA' or 'Indie' games out there!  ****TIPS FOR RUNNING DEADLY PREMONITION**** I am using Windows 8 btw.  If the game crashes at start up----&gt;look for redist folder and find the PhysX_Syssoftware installer and run Repair on it If the game constantly crashes WHILE playing----&gt; Try rebooting your system after exiting or disabling Steam overlay for the game or Run in Windows 98 Compatibility mode If the aiming is extremely limited (ie. Only can aim within a small rectangle on the screen like i did for 99.99% of the game, lol)---&gt; Run in windows 98 compatibility mode  ALSO sometimes deleting the game and reinstalling helps but it is not as reliable as just running in Windows 98 mode.   Hope these tips help and happy gaming !
3571	1	a	I recommend Deadly Premonition to everyone who likes kind of weird characters, good storytelling (that takes it's time) with multiple perspectives from different points on the timeline. You should be stress resistant, because the game will probably crash just before your next save, so you will do some things twice. That should not bother you. It is a kick, because the game itself is not much of a challenge. If you can live with the flaws and see it as an Indie game you got for less than 3 bucks, it is an immersing adventure.  Since the beginning I like the habit of the main character 'York' to talk to 'Zack'. It feels like he is talking to you, the player. It is fun to see other people being puzzled by the actions of the protagonist (as talking to Zack, a person no one can see) and not asking a question. That's what you as the player do: make a list in your mind of things you want to find out and hope that you will get your answers to the right time. Or at the end, at least. Because of the way the story is told you may guess some things and resolve some mysteries for yourself, but I assume that you will still be surprised sometimes. You won't find an answer to everything in the game, like with most scary stories, but that's fine. You will get all important answers to what is important in the game's universe.  Some insights of my journey with the game: I was well aware of bugs because I read other reviews. I installed DPfix. I can highly recommend that. By doing so, crashes did not occur too often and because I saved a lot I managed to play the game without becoming depressed. ;) I can only complain about spending too much time on loading screens. Moving the game from my HDD to my SSD did not seem to boost the time on loading screens. Too bad. In chapter 7 I started to explore the vast world. I should have done that sooner (chapter 2) to have advantages in the game early on. In the first chapters you have time limits, but the game is nearly in real time, so you can do side quests. No worries. Do them! I got my radio, which allows me to drive to different locations in no time without really doing it] after chapter 21. I could have saved a lot of time, not driving myself through the world. You find information about the side quests in the game and also through the descriptions of the achievements. After you finished a chapter, you can replay it. During a replay you cannot save. A replay is nice if you want to do side quests that may be easier in that level or not doable in another. Everything you gain will be available in any other replay and also in your current game progress. A replay only changes at the end (if you save after finishing the chapter) your inventory, trading cards and the quests you finished. So if you keep dying in your current level, do a replay to get food and medipacks in your inventory. Nice cheat. :) I used the replays after I was stuck in chapter 22. I was too lazy to open the archive and therefore I did not find an important key. The game is in general, amazingly straightforward, because it shows in red where you need to go to or interact with to proceed. That is nice, as you always know what to do. (But you still have to solve the puzzles by yourself, the game only indicates where the important puzzle is.) You are never lost.  I like the chilling atmosphere of the game, the horror story itself and especially how it is told. One last hint: Don't miss to have lunch with your colleagues. Eat with them in every chapter possible. It's fun! I am happy that the reviews I read convinced me to play this (indie?) gem.
3573	1	a	Thanks to this game, every time I pour some coffee,  I look with interest. 
3575	1	a	Will you think the graphics on PC are trash? -Yes. Will you mod this game to fix the graphics? -Yes. Will you rage when the game spontaneously crashes once in a while? -Yes. Will you for some inexplainable reason love this game despite all of its flaws? -YES!  In all seriousness, DP is worth a try. If you're willing to do a little modding, and you grab this game on sale, you can't go wrong. That's what I did, and I don't regret it. I've enjoyed the game so far, and would recommend it.   York- 'Do you feel it, Zach? My coffee warned me about it.'
3577	1	a	You know what I love about this game? Everything.  I show this game off all the time and most people think I'm joking. I first played this back in 2012. This is genuinely my favorite game of all time.  The story is like if you took Twin Peaks, translated it into Japanese, had a dude translate it back into English and then had another guy try to read back the lines in Japanese having only seen a couple of English sitcoms. Basically what I'm saying is it's amazing, it has so many twists and major plot points that left me stunned. One of the most satisfying boss fights of all time against a gay cross dressing man. Characters that were likeable and kooky in their own way and made me wish some of their fates turned out different. Some of the most memorable and funny lines in the world 'FK in the coffee' and 'The answer is [onion]' The graphics while lackluster contribute to the off-kilter world of Greenvale.  The only downside is this version crashes all the time and the PS3/Xbox version is slow as hell.  This game is pretty swell.
3579	1	a	 My Personal Score: 0.5/5
3581	1	a	The game is absolutely amazing! The plot is fantastic, while the gameplay is quite obvious and buggy, but the latter doesn't change the emotions you get following the investigation. I recommend the game for all who are interested in creepy detective stories. If you want to enjoy the game truly, please don't pay attention on bugs and some annoying things like following the suspect for about five real minutes - the game is not about that.  I am thankful for all those who were involved into the Deadly Premonition's process.
3583	1	a	This game gets both a 0/10 and a 10/10.  I've thought about this game for months-- Not because of its plot, its gameplay, or its presentation. No. I've wondered if SWERY had planned for the plot to make no sense with terrible dialogue, if he had planned the gameplay to be stiff and hilariously broken. If he planned for this 'serious survival-horror game' to turn around and moon us all along.  It's either a trainwreck or a complete miracle that this game exists.  It could be both for all I know.  Please buy this game. You're witnessing the birth of the first B-Game.  The squirrels make monkey noises. THE SQUIRRELS MAKE MONKEY NOISES.
3585	1	a	Man, I wish that I could simultaneously 'Thumbs up'  and  'Thumbs down' this game. As it is I can't recommend this game but I can't recommend it  enough  either.  The game is  badly  developed on the PC. It basically won't run without using  Durante's dpfix  [blog.metaclassofnil.com]  and even then, with the latest version of that, it has issues like HDR style bloom occasionally flickering and blowing out the screen, an aimbox that doesn't let you aim outside of a  tiny  fraction of the screen, a screeching sound loop when you're in a car and crashes ever 25 minutes on the dot. Still, it's a really,  really  great story with really solid gameplay. On the one hand, if you have a 360 or PS3 then just pick it up used for one of those systems but, as of the time of this writing, it's on sale on Steam for $2.99 with the soundtrack and the OST  alone  is worth that money (listening to it right now). The game's not unplayably broken (with dpfix and compatibility mode for XP SP3/98 set) but it does have enough issues to make it a conditional recommendation even on sale.  Gameplay wise it's an open-world game set in a small town that feels realish. There are two major 'centers' to the town (downtown and a smaller business/residential area) and a bunch of places off in various parts of the countryside all connected with roads that feel planned rather than designed for sandboxing/gameplay. In many ways Greenvale feels more like a town than any other open-world location that I've played because of that.   A day-night cycle is present, as you'd expect, but unlike most open-world games it's not just a perfunctory addition that has no gameplay impact. Rather, NPCs have a routine and are available at certain places at certain times and not at all at others. This impacts when you can start sidequests and when missions can be taken. On top of that NPCs actually drive around Greenvale to get to their various locations. The first time I saw this in action I was standing outside a particular main character's house waiting to be able to start a side mission and I saw her drive up, get out of her car, walk into the house via the garage door (and then the mission still wasn't available so I 'peeked' inside the window and she was in there puttering around).  The story is one of the best told murder mysteries that I've played through. It's got elements of cosmic horror as well as 'good' old-fashioned depravity. As you progress through the missions you're going to be picking up clues that allow you to 'Profile' what occurred (basically a cutscene that starts out unclear but clears up as you gather clues) that will eventually lead you to the killer and uncover what the craziness that goes on in the dark, dark hours of the night is all about.   The shooty gameplay isn't particularly good but, thankfully, it's also not particularly necessary. A standard wrench (that you can get with infinite durability from an early sidequest) will do you well for most of the enemies through most of the game. Shooty wise it harkens back to the Resident Evil style aim and stand mechanics but you'll only hit an enemy if your sight actually crosses them and turns into a reticle. It's not great but it gets the job done and, aside from the three bosses in the late game, it's not really required. Just make sure you do the quests to get a .34 with unlimited ammo before you get to them.  All in all the game is flawed, critically so on the PC, but it's still such a satisfying game with an  excellent  story and a soundtrack that is silly, cheerful, haunting, beautiful and sad all at the same time. Definitely give it a shot in some fashion. Whether that be on one of the last-gen consoles, a PC with dealing with the issues that crop up or even  a no commentary 'Let's Play' 
3587	1	a	Despite all the glitches, this game has one of the most engrossing stories in video games.  The characters are wacky, the story is funny and sad at times. It's a game you won't forget about in a hurry.  Get it in a sale, follow the guide on gamingwiki on how to get it running, and enjoy.
3589	1	a	Deadly Premonition is one of the most unusual and strangest games I've played for a long time. That is true, not only because of its progressively more mystic story and the many weird citizens of Greenvale but also because of the peculiar mix of gameplay and technical elements. Many parts of the game are great, others are so bad they're good again, some are truely (ragequit inducingly) bad. Deadly Premonition is a very rough gem; it's seriously flawed but the game has real character. While I had a lot of fun with the game, playing it was quite frustrating sometimes. After the ending credits rolled I was left unsure whether I should be sad it ended, or glad that I won't have to experience any more of it. All in all the positives outweigh the negatives for me but I only recommend the game to people with patience in combination with high tolerance for bugs and broken gameplay.  For a little bit more detailed impression of some aspects I start with the technical side as this is where the most frustrating flaws of the game lie: The PC version of Deadly Premonition is a terrible console port. From what I read on various websites the game was already quite buggy on consoles; on PC most if not all of these bugs are still there but others were introduced on top of that as well.  For starters I experienced a half a minute up to 5 minutes long blackscreen before any cutscene would play. Because an intro cutscene would play before the start screen everytime the game starts and another one - summarising what had happened in the game before - everytime a game is loaded, this issue already made just starting the game an annoyance. Now add periodic crashes into the mix and the annoyance level is upped to eleven. The game crashed about two dozen times in the course of the game, mostly in the worst situations possible ('Oh, you just beat a sidequest in which you have to refight stronger versions of all bosses in a row without being able to save inbetween and you're just two steps away from a savepoint? Why don't you do it again? TROLOLOLO!'). Deadly Premonitions allows you to replay already finished chapters in order to pick up missed collectables or do sidequests, however during such replays saving is disabled until the chapter is finished, making crashes even worse than in the regular playthrough where often enough a savepoint is closeby.  Usually the crashes appeared somewhat randomly but then the game crashed everytime on the transition from chapter 8 to 9. Setting the compability mode to Windows 98 eventually got me through that part, though.  Additionally to long loading times and crashes there are some bugs with quests: After replaying earlier chapters quest items (especially temporary ones like keys for locked doors) are sometimes deleted from the inventory and can not be retrieved in normal ways. This happened to me once with an item needed for a side quest before I could finish said quest; in the end I had to change my savefile with an hex editor to get it back. Before playing I got the recommendation to play the game with a gamepad because, like many console games, it's supposed to play better that way. Turns out my gamepad (an old BigBen pad) isn't supported and because of the way gamepad integration is done in this port programs like x360ce or xpadder don't work with it rendering it impossible to use my gamepad. Still I found that keyboard + mouse controls worked well enough most of the time, only the handling of additional cars that can be bought later in the game is horrible.  Gameplay: Deadly Premonition's gameplay comes pretty close to what I wished Alan Wake, another game inspired by Twin Peaks, would be like: Almost at any time the player can choose to ignore the mainquest for a while and freely roam around the town of Greenvale, learning more about its citizen by questioning people, starting sidequests and searching for collectables.  At some points the game throws a puzzle at the player. The puzzles are few and they're really easy but it's still more than Alan Wake had to offer, which was mostly composed of cutscenes and filler combat. Speaking of which, a flaw Deadly Premonition shares with AW is boring, repetitive and clunky combat. Reducing the amount of combat or even removing it completely would have been an improvement in my opinion. In order to make up for less/no combat I would have loved to see the 'Profiling' feature expanded. Profiling, for me, is the #1 area where the game left a lot of unused potential. From the role profiling plays in the story one could assume it's a core part of the game but in the end it's pretty dull: At a crime scene the player sees a couple of noisy pictures showing the circumstances of the crime recreated by Agent Francis York Morgan, the game's protagonist, and now has to search for clues. Each found clue makes some of the pictures now appear clearly visible. And that's all. Turning these profiling sessions into puzzles, maybe even letting the players make their own deductions, leading to a branched-out (to some degree at least) storyline, would have vastly improved the whole game and further increased the incentive to replay finished chapters. So I didn't really like combat and the lackluster profiling that much but still both is 'okay' and far from gamebreaking. The one thing I hated about the gameplay are Quick Time Events. I hate QTEs in general but Deadly Premonition has some of the worst QTEs I've ever seen. An especially annoying QTE in the game makes you press buttons, apparently randomly chosen from four possibilities, in rather short time; be too slow or press a wrong button first and it's instant 'gameover, try again!' (including going through several black screens). Fortunately QTEs aren't that abundant but they were closer to making me quit the game for good than any of the technical issues. Deadly Premonition plays a bit like a Japanes horror shooter (think Resident Evil or Silent Hill) combined with an adventure game and a little bit of open-world.  Story/characters/music: The thing I enjoyed the most about the game are the wonderfully eccentric characters. It's full of well written, funny dialogues that are made even funnier by the often completely inappropriate background music. Or rather 'foreground' music, sometimes and seemingly random the music gets louder than the speech (like in a couple of other cases, the overall oddness of the game makes me unsure whether this is a bug or if it was than on purpose). Deadly Premonition can be very surreal sometimes. Still there are many scenes with a more serious tone (it's all about a murder case after all) and those work very well, too. Setting, characters and story are heavily inspired by the TV series Twin Peaks, therefore the aforementioned absurd dialogues are not surprising. Twin Peaks is among my favourite TV shows, so I highly enjoyed Deadly Premonition's setting. However from time to time the game draws a bit too heavily from its inspiration: some details about characters' backstories that get revealed through side quests are no big surprise if you've seen Twin Peaks. The main story line is, several parallels aside, mostly original, though. For the most parts it's well written and interesting but, especially towards the end, it gets cheesy and loses some of its charme. Biggest problem I had with the story was that, without need, the game gives an extremely obvious clue regarding the solution of the case very early on and no character, not even the alleged super-profiler Agent York, considers it during the investigation. Of course, from a meta perspective the game can't just end before it even really started but why bring a thing like that up at all then? Again I can't rule out that it wasn't done on purpose, though; maybe in order to lampshade B-movies from the 80s which are a recurring theme throughout the game and plotholes like that are not exactly a rare occurence in those movies.  Tl;dr in comment section
3591	1	a	If you love weird games and cult B-movies, then this is a must play. The graphics and shooting is nothing special, but the story, characters and dark humor makes this game very memorable. It is also super cheap when it's on sale ($2.79 CDN right now) and there are a lot of interesting side quests to do. This port is half-broken on PC so just Google Durante patch and read the installign instruction.
3593	1	a	Excellent story and characters, though not without its flaws. Most people think this game's main appeal is that it's 'so bad it's good,' but honestly it's the fact that its really easy to get emotionally invested in the weird cast of characters. That's not to say that hilariously bad elements are completely absent, but they're absolutely not the reason people like this game.
3595	1	a	I was going to say something bad about this game since the PC version of Deadly Premonition has one of the worse ports I have ever encountered (It's really bad on the PC &amp; the devs won't even bother fixing the PC version so Durante had to do their work for them) but I played the Xbox version of Deadly Premonition so I have something different to say (I know the xbox version doesn't include the Director's Cut but I had to play this game to see why it was in the cult section of videogames).  Deadly Premonition Review:  I usually have an average experience on most modern horror games like Outlast for example (I'm a very picky person on what I think is a good horror game) but this game gave me the best experience in the psychological, mystery horror genre &amp; I'm going to try to explain why.  Well for starters this game has one of the most interesting main characters in the world of horror. His name is Francis Morgan a.k.a York who has a split personality named Zach who helps him in his cases, every time he takes a sip of coffee he gets a random fortune or a message from it (I wish my coffee could do that) &amp; he has a unique talent of collecting clues then automatically getting his 'Profiling' skills running in his brain (The way he already knows what's going on is amazing, Sherlock Holmes would be proud). The game's strengths are the story, characters, the open world of Greenvale, the amount of side missions you can do (There are also trading cards that you can collect) &amp; the strong plot twists but there are downsides to this game like the combat for example but I'm not going to mention them because the game forgives it's flaws by having cheesy charm (It's hard to explain).  One of my friends gave a perfect word for this game which is 'Bat ♥♥♥♥ crazy' (I played a lot of disturbing games to the point of being desensitized) &amp; I have to agree because the game has one of the weirdest characters in gaming history like Sigourney for example who is obsessed with warming her pot (Not the drug you idiot) &amp; I can't forget the transformation that Thomas had with a red dress later on in the game (Thomas get the ♥♥♥♥ off drugs). The story to this game is your typical who murdered this person scenario but the way the game feeds you the character's backstories &amp; the amount of thinking is brilliant, this game forces you to not trust everyone but it slowly weeds out your guesses (Me, my friend &amp; my family were having fun trying to guess the murderer &amp; we were all talking about theories on who the murderer is). The fact that the game is a combination of Resident Evil's combat (Resident Evil 4 mostly) &amp; the open world sandbox of Grand Theft Auto is a nice combination from the game director SWERY a.k.a Hidetaka Suehiro so I hope future game devs use an open world sandbox in future horror games.  Overall this game is a good example on how to make a good horror game without overusing cheap scares like jumpscares when the main thing you should be afraid of is the unknown &amp; to be aware of who you trust (If I missed anything then be sure to leave feedback so I can edit my review &amp; I forgot that shaving your beard gives you money).
3597	1	a	Deadly premonition tries to mix elements of an open world action game with a survival horror game and it achieves this goal to an extent. It is a poor pc port (although this is somehow mitigated by DPfix) and the production values are subpar but for those who are willing to dig deeper there is a valuable treasure to be found. The direction of the script is exceptional, the characters are well fleshed out and memorable (at least, most of them) and the overall mood is a perfect blend of comedy relief moments and serious thriller sequences. Also, the soundtrack is among the finest I've heard in any game the last 6-7 years. So, give it a try and see for yourself if you can appreciate a one-of-a- kind flawed gem
3599	1	a	After spending about 4 hours dicking around trying to understand why it was crashing so hard, i figured out it had to be started in windows 98 mode. Its playing like a lamb now, For the rest of the game the animations and emotes for their faces are laughable. I've been in the game for about 19 hours now and seems like i hardly made a dent, its so long but I am planning to beat the game. 6/10..it seems a little rough around the edges, but i mean it has its parts.  Edit: I've beaten the game and i can safetly say its a 9/10 :D.. once you get over the problems and glitches its a really interesting story, it actually made me tear up at the end Q_Q.
3601	1	a	Just one of the best games i've ever played. 11/10
3603	1	a	This is the hardest review I've ever had to write.  Having played through maybe half the game, I have to admit that I absolutely LOVE it. It does so many things right and the way it continues to surprise me at every turn is something I've never experienced before.  However, like when your awesome, kind, with-a-heart-of-gold-sweet-and-nice, but drunken uncle - who's usually the very best to hang out with, has the best stories, and showers you with genuine life wisdom at every opportunity - one day feeds your face a blank stare while he feels you up, it hurts like a m0ther£ucker.  It feels so disgusting and wrong that you feel your bones ache, no matter his 'good' intentions. And you know without a doubt, and with an indescribable sadness, that if it hadn't been for that specific unmentionable perk of his, he would have been THE greatest person ever, in all of history.  If Deadly Premonition would have gotten a decent PC-port IT would have been the greatest game ever. Instead, like your uncle's dark, ugly advances at you, it makes you suffer CTDs every hour or so, if you want to continue reaping the amazing benefits you get by playing.  And God help me, there's a REASON why I can't put it away despite that suffering; there's a reason I'm prostituting myself by still playing it. And I can't fathom or even remember any other title I would have done this for, thus my having to save at the towns phone booths every chance I get.  Because: Just like your drunk uncle - who feels you up every now and then, which feels so god damn wrong and unpleasant - the same guy has also recently provided the cure for every known sickness on earth, has the solution for world peace at hand, and is in the process of providing every common man with space travel to the new planets (yes, plural) he's discovered.  Just like that, it is a fact that the pesky, murky river of epic coding failure in Deadly Premonition also contains, not gold nuggets, but straight up gold BARS, of proportions previously unheard of.  And if you had that knowledge, could you, or not, look beyond your uncle Deadly Premonition's one recurring fault? Could you grind your teeth and hold on, just until the unpleasantness went away, just a couple of minutes with restarts every now and then, so he could deliver - to you and the world, yet another great moment? A moment you're not even sure what would entail this time around, but you knew it would blow you and the rest of the world away, and contribute to the ascension of man, soon rivaling the almighty himself?  I'll let you think about that for a minute while I leave you with this: This game has some of the best parts of Twin Peaks in it, combined with certain awesome moments taken straight out of the Seven movie, and lots and lots of the greatest kind of quirkiness - which always feels entertaining and amusing rather than annoying.  Even with the horribly easy and janky combat present; if they would only have done a decent port of this game, I would have given it top credit, just because of the big balls they had to make something so extraordinary.  In the land of generic FPSs, a dime a dozen Early Access $h1t3, and copied to boredom 4x games, Deadly Premonition is the undisputed king, emperor, and penultimate ruler when it comes to creativity and fun storytelling. As of now, it is unfortunately a title you will have to suffer quite a bit of CTDs to play through, but to me that suffering have paid off in abundance.  I am really not sure I can put it away, and I'm considering just taking small breaks every CTD and just naturally continue playing from my latest save point. There is no other great title, big bag of money, or warm and tight hole that would have me spinning 'round its little finger like this.  I'm ashamed to admit it, but I'm probably letting uncle Deadly Premonition get away with it. Maybe you should too.
3605	1	a	Pro - Eccentric, creative storytelling with one of the most compelling and complex protagonists in recent years - budget-priced and enhanced from the original. Con - Game instability, stiff controls, limited soundtrack, repetitive sound samples, poor textures. Also gives me severe cravings for coffee.
3607	1	a	This game is one of the worst I've ever played, and I love every single second of it. From the begining, it is clear that a lot of love went into it, if only that love and care were equaled by skill and budget. The port is perhaps one of the worst ever made, lacking any graphical options whatsoever and being unplayable without a controller, to get any kind of control at all you need to install a fanmade patch or two. This isn't even getting into the myriad of glitches, poor audio mixing, and graphics that would make a dreamcast look down in shame, but there is way more too this game than all the technical problems.  You see, here is where the love comes in. From the begining, every character in the game is memorable, each has there own personality, traits, and even a unique schedule. The plot is fantastic and engaging, and at times even heartfelt and moving. It has a fantastic sense of offbeat humour that will remind enlightened players of Twin Peaks. Actually, the entire game will remind people of Twin Peaks, because from the setting to the characters to the music this game is a love letter to all things David Lynch. It should be no surprise that its flaws are just part of the charm, and together they make the game seem more complete for it.  Seriously, buy this game if you haven't already, you won't regret it.
3609	1	a	The graphics look like a ps2 game and the combat is kind of clunky, but this game makes up for it with pure charm.  Amazing story and great characters.    Download DPfix to improve the game   http://blog.metaclassofnil.com/?tag=dpfix 
3611	1	a	twin peaks the game.
3613	1	a	Great mystery story paired with quite poor combat parts and alot of issues with crashing in certain areas but 100% worth it to play all the way.   I highly recommend it!
3615	1	a	Picked this up for £2 during a sale, didn't expect much. Had to patch it and apply several weird fixes before it would run, and it kept crashing randomly. Even with a controller, the movement was a bit clunky, and the graphics are straight from 2005.  Despite all of that, Deadly Premonition is probably my favourite game of 2016. After sticking with it for a bit, the story becomes incredibly immersive, the characters you meet are funny and eccentric, and you can't help but fall in love with the game. The story is genuinely intriguing, and all the weird quirks (getting paid to peep into people's houses, stuffing your face with an endless supply of lollipops, main character's oddball rants) make the game even better.   Protips: - Only pick this up if you care about story in games. It's Deadly Premonition's strongest suit ... but also pretty much the only one. If you like story-rich RPGs, you will love this. - Don't take this game too seriously at the beginning.  - Play with a controller, it makes everything much more manageable. - Patch the game before you start!
3617	1	a	Got paid for shaving my face, and a giant, demonic dog fell from the sky and totaled my car.  10/10
3619	1	a	Game itself is effin great and if you like off the wall stuff you'll remember this one. In between the superficially crappy writing, the confusing tone and badly implemented, clunky mechanics awaits a murder mystery that you just have to uncover yourself. I said the writing is superficially crappy: it's a ruse to lower your expectations and surprise you later.  Buy it discounted if you're fine with a DOS-era style port that will require fiddling with drivers, computer reboots and INI editing to bring it up to shine.  Technical addition: If you have issues with an Xbone controller (right analogue stick all messed up), it will require downgrading of your controller driver to an earlier version. See this forum post on how to get it working right:  http://pinnaclegameprofiler.com/forum/showthread.php?31550-Making-Xbox-One-Controller-Work-with-Windows-10-Please-Sticky 
3621	1	a	The Citizen Kane of video games.
3623	1	a	Honestly, I was surprised at how much I liked this game. I knew people had mixed views on it before playing, but I was not expecting the amazingly original storyline and surprise ending. If you think you're going to like this game even a little bit, it will probably surpass your expectations. Once you get it working, the awful port becomes just another quirk of this oddly satisfying game.
3625	1	a	this game is part tv murder mystery and part resident evil.   The game is long and could be boring if you can't get into it but has a enjoyable story. this game has alot of charm and if you can get past its short comings you'll really enjoy yourself.
3627	1	a	What’s that, Zach – you’re at your wit’s end?  Honestly, I don’t know where to start. DEADLY PREMONITION is one of the most memorable games I have ever played, but sadly not always for the right reasons. There is so much wrong with this game it’s not possible to list all its flaws in a brief review like this. Suffice it to say, it runs terribly on the PC with the longest load times I have ever encountered and more glitches than I could shake a stick at. The graphics are pretty awful (I used the DP patch which supposedly improves performance and graphics but it still looks like something from the early 90s). The controls are awful and if I hadn’t discovered a tweak that fixes a ridiculous aiming problem I would probably have given up on the game. The combat is hideous too, with the aforementioned dreadful aiming system and poor mechanics. Even the UI is an irritating mess. And yet despite all this I’m glad I stuck it out until the end (incidentally, despite having completed the game I only found a handful of the many side quests, as they are often time-sensitive and way off the main story track). So what’s good about DP? Well it certainly is quirky, and it’s easy to see why it’s gained such a devoted cult following. At its core DP has a very strong story backed up by solid voice acting. It has many weird and interesting characters and some crazy dialogue. Although it is derivative (Twin Peaks and Silent Hill are often-used comparators, and rightly so) it still has a unique personality. There’s no doubt that if DP had been produced to the same standard as a AAA game it would be outstanding. But unfortunately I can only recommend it if you have a slight masochistic streak, as, it appears, do I. There’s a five-star game in here struggling to get out but due to all its faults I can only give it 3.5/5.
3629	1	a	Yes, absolutely. There are technical problems, and crashes, but those can mostly be overcome, and if you persevere it's one of the best game story experiences I've had.
3631	1	a	You can grow a beard 10/10
3633	1	a	This game took me a while to get into, honestly. The PC port is not fantastic, and it would crash on me frequently, until I found a fix that would make it crash every few hours instead of every hour. So, y'know, still frequent crashes. Also, the gameplay isn't great, with the driving being especially terrible and the combat kind of feeling superfluous. However, the story itself is pretty great, with twists and turns that you don't quite expect. It's campy and great. I can't heartily actually recommend everyone play it, but if it sounds cool to you, give it a shot.
3635	1	a	In Deadly premonition you play the role of FBI Special Agent Francis York Morgan, but you can call him York, everybody calls him that, sent to a town to investigate the murder of a young girl. While the premise sounds generic and cliche, Deadly Premonition is anything but that and is by far one of the most unique games I've ever played. Deadly Premonition features dated visuals, mediocre gameplay and more bugs than in your backyard yet it's still an extremely memorable and unique experience that shines most brightly on it's plot and narrative.   While I'm first and for most gameplay over everything when it comes to gaming, Deadly Premonition is one of the only, if not the only game I'd recommend based on it's setting, plot and characters. The game is a mixture of Thriller, Horror and Dark Comedy blended together in a extremely unique manner.  While you may be put off by the dated, crude presentation and bugs this game possesses, it's still an experience that I couldn't recommend enough if you can overlook it's faults. It's so bad that it's a masterpiece, think of the film Troll 2 which is widely regarded as the 'best worst film' of all time and is an absolutely hilarious masterpiece for all the wrong reasons. The gameplay itself is somewhat reminiscent of Resident Evil 4 but has some awkward controls, thankfully this does little to affect the game as the focus is on it's incredibly strong writing.  The story is absolutely brilliant thanks to the writers eccentric and quirky style, there really is nothing out there like this. Again I do recommend caution when buying this game, you'll need to tweak a few things in order to even get the game to run and there are a few mods which enhance the visuals and allow the game to be played 1080p but that aside this is an experience that should not be overlooked if you're a fan of crime stories and unique writing.
3637	1	a	This is the best worst game Ive ever played. Charming Japanese take on American Horrow. Wierd , bad graphics but also somehow as addictive as mainling a pound of heroin. Very light hearted yet very dark at the same time. WHY DO I LOVE THIS GAME?
3639	1	a	I mean, the game is objectively bad in many ways. I'm not going to tell you differently. But the ways in which it are bad are honestly what make it so amazing.  The absolute silliness of the plot, yet still manages to be surprising at points. The characters in the town itself whch give you ridiculous ♥♥♥ quests that make no sense. The ridiculously realistic driving simulator that makes the drive between missions actually be like 5 minutes of driving with no other action. It's so good and yet... well.  it's one of those games you have to play through at least once, probably twice, to really appreciate. It's just uhh... play it. It's easily one of my favourite games ever, and I honestly have no idea why.
3641	1	a	'Do u fell it, Zach? My coffee warned me about it.' DP is one of the strangest video games of all time. 10/10
3643	1	a	The best bad-good game money can buy.
3645	1	a	'Do you feel it, Zach? My coffee warned me about it. Yesterday morning the milk I poured in my coffee made a sign. It said, ‘Tomorrow you’ll arrive in a place that will change your fate.’  2 out of 2 peaks.
3647	1	a	 This game is truly one-of-a-kind and one of the few games I would encourage everyone to play.   I will get this out of the way first - this game is a horrible PC port. It can require a lot of messing around to even get it to run, and if you want it to run higher than 720p then you will have to install mods to achieve that. I would personally experience drops in frame-rate followed by the game crashing approximately every 2 hours on my setup but your problems may vary! (The director’s cut does have some pro's compared to the original even though it is a bad port - the controls are improved and the combat is easier - in a good way)  It's a testament to the compelling nature and uniqueness of this game that I would gladly put up with such an experience.  You play as FBI Agent Francis York Morgan who is called to a remote town called Greenvale to investigate a murder of a young woman - and it doesn't take long to become clear that there is something very strange indeed going on. The game has been compared a lot to the TV Show 'Twin Peaks' and it is a clear influence - for anyone unfamiliar with the show, it combines mystery with quirky characters and absurd happenings and this game is no different.  It is full of weird, cliché (in comedic fashion) and intriguing people - everyone has their own odd quips and interactions that make the game interesting and fun. It can be confusing at first as you try to decide if the game you are playing and the dialogue you are hearing is serious or not - but soon you will lose yourself in the combination of mystery and absurdity and want to experience all that Greenvale has to offer.  The game is all about the experience and storyline - you will drive around town and engage in combat throughout much of the game - neither of them are anything special. They are both very archaic and along with the graphics are not what you would expect in a relatively modern game. For my experience though I never had any particular  problem  with either of them, they are just not what make the game enjoyable. However, although the driving itself isn't great, there is something very pleasureable about travelling around the town and engaging in your day to day tasks like going to lunch with your police colleagues or going to a bar in the evenings to play darts and talk with the townsfolk.  It is the mad characters, the crazy music, the twists, the absurd and even genuinely touching moments that shine in this game and keep you coming back. I have never really ever experienced a game quite like it and (although I would love one) I will perhaps not play another like it again.  A very unique game - one with plenty of flaws but also so much to love. I would recommend all people with an interest in story-driven games to try it out.
3649	1	a	This game is great Zach
3651	1	a	N.B. There are some computers that the game just will not display properly on. It's fine on my AMD PC, but my Nvidia laptop can't display any text without severe distortion (both run 64-bit Windows 7, and have the same issue with Amnesia the Dark Descent). I don't know why, but if you can get a demo from somewhere to test whether it works, or check the forums, it might help. Also, this game is available on Xbox 360 and PS3, if you find the PC version isn't for you, although the PS3 version is the same as the Steam version (The Director's Cut).  This is one of the few buggy games I would recommend to people, and there are very good reasons why. For starters, it's horrifying and unique. The story sticks in my mind the way that Walking Dead has, and may I say, even more so.  Did you like Twin Peaks? Do strange events picque your curiosity? Then this game could be for you. You play the role of a FBI agent with a split personality. The twist here is that you, the player, are treated like the secondary personality. York needs your help to solve a cross-country murder spree, which brings him to the town the game is set in.  Mr Francis York Morgan is thust into a stunningly creepy town that appears norma on the surface, but harbours secrets in almost every home. Help York to stop the Raincoat Killer, and oh so much more. Scratch away the surface and look deeper, take your time and explore the world, talk to people each day, and you'll experience the best this story can offer you.  Please, if you feel you can handle a few bugs, give this game a go if only for the plot. Save often lest it crashes (but I've had to do that with Saints Row 4 about the same number of times). This game isn't about combat - it's about everything else. Solve the puzzles, find rare items for townsfolk to help you in your mission, remember the past and recount the present.   If you fancy something strange, and you don't mind rough edges, *please* try this game. Wait for a sale if you're unsure, but don't let it pass by without trying it. Even a year after playing it, the 36 hours I spent in this world are still etched in my mind. Thumbs up all the way.
3653	1	a	Do you like David Lynch? Do you like comfy white America? Do you like Neo-Noir? Do you like Twin Peaks?  Then get it.
3655	1	a	'Mr. Francis York Morgan, you are the protagonist of the generation. So says Mr. Stewart'  To summarize Deadly Premonition, the graphics suck balls. The driving sucks balls. The combat sucks balls. The animations suck balls. In fact the entire control scheme sucks monkey balls. But underneath all this ball sucking lies an absolute gem of a game.   The plot is great and the script is actually extremely well-written. I dare say these two factors were probably the only driving force behind my decision to see this game to the end. A higher budget and better production values might've done wonders with the game.  This game is one huge package of silliness. A lot of the time it will make you laugh but mostly you will be laughing at the game itself. Deadly Premonition is a game where you see your fortune in the morning cup of coffee. And there's an hour-long level where you're running after a dog. Did I mention that dog had its own rap theme song?   And just when you think this game couldn't get any stranger, the final two chapters take ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ness to a whole new level. Lovely!  Deadly Premonition is not a game you recommend to anybody. But it most definitely is a game that should be played at least once.
3657	1	a	A very flawed masterpiece. Frequent crashing and inability to play full-screen almost put me off playing through but I'm glad I did. It takes a while to get going but this is a brilliant game worthy of your time, with memorable characters, great music and a storyline straight out of Twin Peaks.
3659	1	a	To get it out of the way first, the PC port is pretty damn bad, even with DPFix. Unlike the Dark Souls port which was good (no new bugs, old bugs fixed, solid FPS, it runs, etc.), this port is falling apart at the seams. There's old bugs, new bugs, plenty of crashes, and what have you.  However, the core of the game's story, ie: the characters, the setting, the story, the mystery, is just so god damn solid that I was willing to overlook the PC port issues. There's just something to the overall charm of these things that makes it easy to overlook the issues. In fact, some of the issues feel like they add to the game. The janky animations, the poorly balanced voice clips, the comically bad car handling, and some other oddities seem to just fit so well with the game.  Even with all it's issues, this is a great game!
3661	1	a	 WARNING : This game is buggy as hell, and requires a lot of patience and/or workarounds to play.   Deadly Premonition  -- which may as well be called  Twin Peaks: The Game  -- is a great game idea poorly executed and even more poorly ported to the PC from consoles. Game-breaking bugs (such as disappearing keys) and random crashes (only avoided by playing problematic sections in Windows 98 compatibility mode) will bite you if you're not expecting them, so consulting a guide or walkthrough ahead of each section is practically compulsory.  So... why am I recommending it? Despite its faults,  Deadly Premonition  is so delightfully weird that I can't  not  recommend it. The story is fantastic, the characters are memorable, the murdery mystery is compelling, and the comic relief is hilariously bizarre.  Pick it up on sale (it's often about $2.50) and you'll definitely get your money's worth.
3663	1	a	BE WARNED! there is a crazy amount of glitches in the PC version. I only give this a good rating because the story is so great. It's Twin Peaks if it were to have been made in Japan.
3665	1	a	I would call this game the 'best worst game ever.' It's basically ♥♥♥♥♥♥ gameplay, a plot taken directly from Twin Peaks, and I love it. It's hard to describe what makes this game so good, without just playing it for yourself. So, pick it up while it's cheap, and play it, and it'll change your life.  Also, the squirrels make monkey sounds, and it's the best.
3667	1	a	I don't really know words of how to describe how fricking werid this game is. It feels like a game that was locked in a time capsule that was only unearthed three years ago(2010) if you like twin peaks or games that are just bizarre then this could be your cup of coffee  
3669	1	a	It's such a good game, unfortunatley a lazy effort on the developers part. At launch there was no controller support, however that has now been patched, but the game itself can still be borderline unplayable unless patched with DPfix (the same person who fixed the Dark Souls port). Even with that patch however the game still suffers from a range of glitches, bugs, crashes and audio/visual problems, still it's hard to not recommend this game. After all it's problems have been sorted out, this is easily one of the best games on Steam, with a good sense of humor and some nice references to certain things in pop culture (such as Twin Peaks), you might want to hold of purchasing it until ALL of the problems have been fixed.
3671	1	a	It's really hard to rate Deadly Premonition. In one hand it's utterly broken, buggy and sometimes even outdated, but it's also very clever, atmospheric and unique. Basically DP is an open-world investigating taking place in a little town, just like Twin Peaks. But this description just doesn't cut it. It's also extremely bizarre, weird and often creepy. The 'side quests' are also very different from what you're used to, they mostly revolve around getting to know the people of Greenvale, and actually this is how I spent around 3/4 of my almost 40 hour playthrough... just getting to know this town and the people living in it. York (and Zach) the 2 in 1 detective, George the king of the town, Harry the weird millionaire who always wears a mask for some reason... and even though you get to know the characters very well, they still managed to keep the thing that are important well hidden, lurking in the background, just so they can surprise you with it later. The story and the narrative are just perfect. Same could be said for the soundtrack and the voice actors, all top-notch. All in all Deadly Premonition is a terribly broken, ugly (and despite these) amazing game, which I'd wholeheartedly recommend to all my friends :) This is probably as close as we'll ever gonna get to a Twin Peaks game folks!
3673	1	a	This is probably the most broken release I've ever purchased on Steam, and I do not regret it at all.  Fantastic game with some low-budget development that constantly shows, but has an amazing plot. The characters and plot alone justify this purchase despite that you  will  have to use DPfix to get the most of this experience.  That is all.  Buy it, you casual scum.
3675	1	a	Don't play without  http://blog.metaclassofnil.com/  Look for DPfix The game crashes regularly. Save FREQUENTLY.  That being said, it's an amazing game and nothing else like it exists. It will leave an impression on you for as long as you live, especially if you like B movies. You like the strange and the bizarre, don't you, Zach?
3677	1	a	Nice shot. Amazing. Bullseye. Nice sho- Nice shot. Amazing.
3679	1	a	 1. The Port,  Let's get this out of the way. The port is bad. No graphics options, 720p only. This can be fixed by using the DPfix by Durante, and downloading HD fonts, HUD and icons. The game likes to crash for many reasons and in many different ways. Most of them can be prevented by smoking cigarettes (in the game, but I can assure you it also helps IRL), editing the exe file with CFF Explorer, running the game with compatibility mode set to Win98, running the game in window mode and/or changing default controls to a gamepad. There's apparently a bug that corrupts your save file, but I luckily haven't encountered that one.  During my 29 hours of gameplay at least 5 of them I had to replay because of the crashes. Googling, setting and fixing stuff to be able to even play the game took me around another 3 hours.  It was worth it.   2. The Gameplay.  Deadly Premonition is an open-world survival horror detective action adventure game. You can explore (by foot and by car) the town of Greenvale at your leisure, doing side activities, like quests, fishing or collecting stuff. However, you need to eat and sleep (or drink coffee). During the main questline you mainly travel around, talk to people, solve simple puzzles and shoot some undead zombie-like things. There are also boss fights. The combat generally resembles that of traditional survival horror games like Resident Evil or Silent Hill. Walk away from the enemies, turn around, prepare your weapon and shoot.  The attention to detail is especially worth the praise. You need to wash your suits and shave if you don't want to look like a hobo. When you pass another car at night, its front lights reflected in your own rear-view mirror will blind you for a brief moment. And car mirrors don't even work besides that. Other mirrors you encounter do work fine though.  Let's not forget about the ridiculous, idiotic and totally uncalled-for QTE sequences. They're so bad, it makes them almost good.   3. The Story.  FBI agent Francis York Morgan arrives in the town of Greenvale to investigate a case of murder. Then appear the aforementioned zombie things making the whole plot a hillarious mess. The story is great, even though it doesn't make much sense. At least there are some nice plot twists and everything gets explained by the end of the game. The cutscenes and dialogues are simply a piece of art. Thanks to the music completely unfitting the situation in most cases, they are genuinely funny.   4. The Characters.  This has to be the selling point of DP. There's a lot of different characters and the great most of them have personalities of their own. York himself is quite an individual. He talks to his second personality, Zach, all the time, even with people around, without a trace of embarrasment. He's also a walking bag of strange habits and mannerisms. The whole Greenvale looks like an uncanny valley. Getting to know those people is totally worth the effort.   5. The Summary.  Don't be discouraged by all those technical problems I mentioned   (and those that I did not)   - Deadly Premonition is a great game and the quality of the PC port doesn't change that fact in the slightest.  Objectively 9.5/10.
3681	1	a	Looks like blend of Twin Peaks and Silent Hill. Worth trying.
3683	1	a	Many people say the port is terrible but in my opinion the game runs fine! Deadly premonition has a nice concept. The game doesnt have the best acting, graphics, and animations but the gameplay wise is really fun. Found it interesting that you can drive around town, you gotta eat food, and etc.   Game isnt worth 24.99 but its def worth the price when it goes on sale!
3685	1	a	York is the greatest video game protagonist of all time and Deadly Premonition's story, characters, humor, atmosphere, soundtrack and sheer personality are way above what you will find in most critically acclaimed titles. It's not without its flaws, like a subpar combat system and bad graphics (even for the time), but it's totally unique and isn't afraid to experiment, something sorely lacking in other games.  If you own a Xbox 360, play the regular version there instead of this one. The little improvements of the Director's Cut aren't worth it, since this port suffers from common crashing issues and some bugs.  However, a bad port is still better than not playing Deadly Premonition, so if this is your only option of experiencing the game, go for it. Just be aware of the following:  - Check  the PC Gaming Wiki  [pcgamingwiki.com]  and its tutorial on installing DP Fix, SweetFX, better textures and solutions for crashing;  - Always run the game directly through DP.exe instead of Steam or other methods;  - In order to get an item that will make navigating through the game much easier and more pleasant, do Side Missions No. 004 &amp; 005 (George's sidequests) as soon as possible;  - Do not read the description of the Trading Cards before finishing the game, since some of them contain spoilers.   F... K... In the coffee! It never fails. 
3687	1	a	the game is good on console  the true mystery is how to get this port working
3689	1	a	Looks like blend of Twin Peaks and Silent Hill. Worth trying.
3691	1	a	One of the most emotional games I've ever played. It was amazing, right Zach?
3693	1	a	I finished the game but the final cutscenes were so unwatchable due to the fact they were each seperate pieces which took more than an hour to load. I had to just close the game and watch the ending on youtube. Wont bother with all the extra stuff because it's such a pain going through any loading screen. I am aware this is the main complaint for the PC version of this game but I didn't expect it to be as troublesome as it was...Yolo
3695	1	a	I can't think of a harder game to score, so I am glad I stopped giving them this year. The best way I can describe this is L.A. Noire meets Silent Hill, and that is some pretty hefty praise coming from me. The action could definitely be annoying, not unlike Silent Hill, but the story and all of the little touches elevated the game well above the sum of its parts. Looking back, I wonder how many of the deadly sins the 'big bad' committed throughout the game. I could think of a few right away once I realized his persona. My only regret is that I didn't start chasing the side quests early enough to get them all done, and I really can't recommend the experience enough.
3697	1	a	Never before have I experienced such an awful, weird but utterly amazing game. This game really is so bad, it’s amazing. 10/10
3699	1	a	PLAY THIS GAME FOR THE BEST EXPERIANCE EVER
3701	1	a	Go to where Steam is installed -&gt; SteamApps -&gt; common -&gt; Deadly Premonition The Director's Cut -&gt; redist. Scroll all the way down until you find 'PhysX_SystemSoftware' right click it -&gt; Repair wait a few second and *BOOM* the game should lunch! ______  Putting that a side, I'm more than 9 hours into the game and had 0 crashes. The only crash that I ever got was when I installed the game and tried to lunch it. Read a guide that told me to do what I wrote above and.. that's it.  Now, I got this when it was on sale and my gosh the game is a mess! But not that bad kind of a mess! It's amazing! It's impossible to explain, but I'll try my best... Take a bowl, put open world into it, then a bloody and a very horrible crime, elements of some comedy, a mix of good/bad controls, a mix of good/bad graphics, a mix of good/bad soundtrack, a mix of good/bad voice acting, cars that slide on turns, the best coffee with milk. Take all that, mix it up really good. Cook it for at least 20 hours and serve it to an FBI agent!!  Everything I wrote above made little to no sense? Well that just what it is! If you can handle a literally bloody story, then you should try it. Otherwise.. I don't think you'll like it. You have to risk it to get the biscuit. At least that's what I saw in my coffee..
3703	1	a	It's a weird game that had me wondering how to back up the fact that it entertained me, but I'm pretty sure it will entertain you as well if you give this glitchy PC release a chance.  7/8  No refunds.  Actually, you can get a refund now. What I meant was that you wouldn't be getting it from me personally. Yeah.
3705	1	a	Such a strange game. Recommended if you like games that quickly change the tone from horrifying, to hilarious in just a few moments.  Top soundtrack, easily one of the more memorable ones:         YouTube™ Video:  Deadly Premonition OST- Life is Beautiful&nbsp;
3707	1	a	Aside from the crashes, and visual DEFECTS this game has gone through it's up there in my top 5 games. It's optimal to play this with a controller, and there's mods to fix a lot of this game up.
3709	1	a	I spent a few hours trying to get the game to work. It's crashed dozens of times. The graphics are awful. The port is basically a mess.  But despite it all this is one of the best games I've ever played. The story is great, the characters are quite interesting and the silly quirks will just make you laugh till your sides hurt.   If you like a good story and enjoy well written characters then you won't want to put this cult classic down for a second. Don't forget to use DPFix!
3711	1	a	Twin Peaks - The video game, if your a fan of the 1989-1992 TV series Twin Peaks, u will LOVE THIS GAME the story, the characters, the fact that u can wait around town and catch unsuspecting citizens doing strange things, also therte is no other open world survival horror games like this, it truely is one of a kind...  NOW, the problem.... getting this thing to run, the devs really left the work to us, u MUST download a mod to get the game up to 1080p, but once u get this game running smooth, it really is the best way to experience the game, the 360 and ps3 versions each have their strengths and faults, but neither are a good experience, finally being able to ewnjoy this game at 1080p 60fps, and it is really a one-of-a-kind experience  PC:specs: mayber this will help anyone with a similar rig Intel i7 3770K (overclocked to 4.5ghz) 16 gb RAM GPU : R9 280x (overclocked to 1100mhz) [also known as Radeon HD 7900 series] SSD: Samsung 500gb EVO Operating system : Windows 8.1  Game options: DPfix (1080P run in a window) compatability options : DEFAULT!!!! the game will not run through the launcher, however the launcher itself runs to change input/controller settings. run the game by clicking the dp.exe directly  EVERY system is different to get this game to run perfectly, but i hope this helps.
3713	1	a	I played the GoG version of this game first. (So, don't be fooled by the time Steam is displaying :D)  tl;dr at the bottom  Let me say that this is one of the best games I  ever  played.  It is hard to compare this game to any other title... it has some sort of open world, a bit of RPG, a whole lot of an adventure....   It starts very strange and you don't have any clue what awaits you. But if you aren't afraid of that, you'll find yourself in a great adventure-thriller-detective-horror.... thingy.... o.O It's really hard to describe,  what  this game actually is.   The game has all sorts of moments. It is sometimes very creepy, sometimes ridiculus, exciting, surprising....  I really enjoied it and played the whole game within some days.   tl;dr
3715	1	a	This game is great if you're okay with doing some H E A V Y modding before playing
3717	1	a	God awful port of a great game.
3719	1	a	Twin Peaks teeters on the very edge of exquisite absurdity. Its genius is that it plays both on the level of subtly ludicrous melodrama and on the level of a baffling whodunit, as most lines of dialogue appear to contain a hidden meaning, most faces a dark secret.
3721	1	a	Played a few hours on it. Fantasic atmosphere, comedy, character and it seems to have a lot of depth. Really fun. PLaying it on windows 7 x64, it does have a bug but theres plenty of explainations how to fix it and its just 1 simple fix. No fps problems or glitches, plays well.
3723	1	a	Such a strange game. Recommended if you like games that quickly change the tone from horrifying, to hilarious in just a few moments.  Top soundtrack, easily one of the more memorable ones:         YouTube™ Video:  Deadly Premonition OST- Life is Beautiful&nbsp;

3727	1	a	Nominated for the 'Game within a game' Award.  (Review updated 11/23/2016) I first played this game many years ago on the Xbox 360. I then got it on steam from my better half.  I started to play it ( back in the day) because it looked silly.. AND at the time it got a review of 1/10 ( that has since been changed to a better score) but the game showed me it was much more than silly voice acting and odd characters.   This is a wonderful game with a deep story. VERY campy. Based around a show called Twin Peaks. Yes, there are some issues. Controller issues, things like that.. but playing the game is worth it even with the small issues.  This game is not for everyone! As i said it is very campy. Some might not understand this.( or it is not their type of humor) Try to give it a chance you might love it.   There is a mod out there to make the game easier to play ( more choices for screen size, better map and that) It is called DPfix 0.9.5 (  http://blog.metaclassofnil.com/?p=438  ) be sure to get the newest one. I gave an older one by mistake and the map was so messed up.  Watch these videos to see! (I think it was the wrong one for 9 eps.. OOPS!! That was my fault. I am sorry.)

3729	1	a	best unplayable game Ive never played
3731	1	a	When I run the game for the first time (it was on XBOX360 back then) and saw the graphics, I was one step to ditching the best and most emotionally capturing games I've ever played! Nothing to say more. Get it and play it! But don't listen to other people, saying you have to play on hardest difficulty right from the start to get all the fun. Just don't, you'll hate the game. Finish the game on normal or easy and only then switch on Hard mode. Fun guaranteed!
3733	1	a	I don't think I've spent more time on the starting menu on any other game than this.  This is not a game, this is an art.
3735	1	a	Very good and price on super sale it kind reminds me of resident evil type games. exellent. recommended.
3737	1	a	Best imaginary friend award Also it's a hilarious game so you should definitely check it out lol :D
3739	1	a	This is my first ever Steam review and unfortunately it’s going to be more of a fix suggestion than a review (my review was very long initially but Steam wouldn’t allow me to submit it so I had to chop it considerably). I was able to fix this game (so that it ran) fairly quickly. Here's how I did it:  1. Go to where the game is installed on your PC. For me it's at C &gt; Program Files (x86) &gt; Steam &gt; steamapps &gt; common &gt; Deadly Premonition The Director's Cut 2. Open the redist file and double-click the application called PhysX_SystemSoftware (.msi) 3. Select the Repair option and let it run through completely.  4. When that's finished, launch the game again.  NOTE: I should point out that I AM running the game in compatibility mode (Windows XP SP3). For me, this fix worked immediately. I DID NOT download the 4GB patch that's been suggested! I hope this helps some of the people who were having trouble.   Do I recommend this game? Yes! I can't recommend it enough. In fact, it's one of my favorite games of all-time (I played the 360 version previously). However, if you are expecting not to have to caress this game softly in order to make it purr – it is probably not for you!  If you are willing to put in a little effort though - I think you will be pleasantly surprised at everything you get out of this game.

There is a mod out there to make the game easier to play ( more choices for screen size, better map and that) It is called DPfix 0.9.5 (  http://blog.metaclassofnil.com/?p=438  ) be sure to get the newest one. I gave an older one by mistake and the map was so messed up.  Watch these videos to see! (I think it was the wrong one for 9 eps.. OOPS!! That was my fault. I am sorry.)

3745	1	a	F. K. in coffee! As clear as a spring morning! But the port falters.
3747	1	a	The definition of so bad it's good. What the game lacks in control and gameplay it makes up for in solid story, quality voice acting, memorable characters, and a genuinely interesting series of plot twists.   The game frequently goes on sale for $2.49 so theres no reason you shouldn't own this masterpiece.  Isn't that right Zach?  (This is my favorite game. I have a 360 copy factory sealed in box which has already tripled in value since release.)
3749	1	a	 Genre: Horror/Third-person shooter
3751	1	a	- Horrible port - Constant crashes - Wonky and buggy driving physics - Poor graphics - Terrible map and navigation system - The open world is almost completely empty - Some awful voice acting - Nonsensical dialogue and writing - Ridiculous characters and situations - Combat so derivative and crappy I can see them going 'Hmm, yeah, this didn't turn out so great... Let's just add a bunch of easily obtainable cheat weapons as standard otherwise no one's going to bother slogging through this.'  And despite (and a bit because) all of the above the game still manages to be utterly charming in that very peculiar Japanese way, it's a bit like Twin Peaks presented in the style of House of the Dead 2, and I sunk nearly 50 hours 100%-ing the game (including many, many restarts trying to work around bugs and problems or replaying sections due to crashes.) Common sense dictates the list above should really have precluded that, but somehow the essence of the game just made me embrace it all.  I don't quite know either.
3753	1	a	Original story and gameplay. Fantastic soundtrack.
3755	1	a	Solve crimes.  Fight zombies.  Talk to your imaginary friend.  Shave your beard.  Oh ♥♥♥♥ is that a giant zombie dog behind my car?  That is a giant zombie dog behind my car.  Don't read the achievements' descriptions.  FUN.
3757	1	a	Horey shet, this game is great.  First things first though, while 'directors cut' is slightly different from the original on the consoles, its a horrible PC port. Luckily theres a fix for most of the issues and if you disable steam overlay, you can play it, crash free prettymuch. Just dont alt+tab or do anything outside the game while playing.  I absolutely love this game, its very story/character focused and both of those two are just batshit insane in a very charming way. The characters are so much fun, the story is interesting and keeps you on the edge of your seat all the way. The gameplay however is clunky, weird and feels like some really old Japanese RPG's in many ways and shares the many gripes that Jap games in general have, which would be clumsy menus, unnecessary button prompts here and there ect, but oddly enough, it didnt bother me that much. Killing baddies is kind of funny, but the general atmosphere is great and quite spooky at times too.  All in all, I'd say that get this on some console if you want to play it without any issues from the start, or get this PC version and be prepared to fix its many issues. Its an amazing, crazy, weird, funny and extremely interesting.  I'd r8 it an 8/8 m8, no h8.
3759	1	a	So, let's get this straight: this is a TERRIBLE game. But I love it so much. Now to explain why I feel this way.  Deadly Premonition follows the story of a quirky FBI detective, Francis York Morgan (just call him York), as he and his imaginary friend Zach solve the mystery behind the murder of a young women, Anna Graham, in the fictional town of Greenvale, Washington. It's a classic 'who dun it', story, which slowly melts more and more into the bizzare, and stange as you get further along into the game. It should be said, that this game clearly takes HEAVY inspiration from the 90s TV series Twin Peaks, which follows a similar story of a detective unravelling the murder of a young women, which also slowly gets more and more surreal as the series gets further along in it's story.   The gameplay, and graphics are by far where most concerns arise regarding the game, with shoddy aiming, terrible driving while you drive around the town doing either the main quest, or the various other sidequests,  bad textures, some character models look like ones you'd see in PS2 games, bad framerate, etc. Some gameplay decisions made in this game can be extremely baffling in how poorly designed they are. These are by far the games weakest aspect, and are honestly sometimes a hassle to play through. But, however I believe the game makes up for what it lacks in its characters, and overall quirkiness.   I cannot tell you how many times I smiled, or gave a chuckle to the characters interacting with each other, I won't spoil any of these moments, as you should most definately experiance for themselves, but I can say that if the game hits any nail on the head, it is most definately in this aspect. Some may find some distaste in the campy/cheesy/sometimes downright TERRIBLE diolouge in this game, but I personally loved it, and I found myself getting excited when I was playing through the game, and a cutscene would appear, because it meant I would get a chuckle or two out of it. Something should also be said about the soundtrack, as it fits the surreal, quirky atmosphere of the game perectly. The game is also quite lengthy, with various sidequests you can do, in addition to the main story.  Now, many people wouldn't find this justification to buy this game, that the gameplay and graphics completely ruin the experiance, but I would seriously disagree. It seems to me that this game had a lot of love, and effort put behind it, but the game developers skills just didn't match up to what they were hoping would turn out. As I said, some may not like this game, some may even hate this game, but to those who want a different experiance, something that is out of norm, and completely changes the way you would normally think about games, I'd say give this game a go. I've bought this game three times already, on the Xbox 360, PS3, and of course PC, and I haven't regretting buying a single copy. This game will give you a unforgetable ride, which must be played to be believed. In my opinion, this is without a doubt, the best worst game I have ever played. AND I LOVED EVERY MINUTE OF IT.  
3761	1	a	This game is quirky, unpolished and unfortunately very crash prone - but nonetheless a hidden gem in my opinion. Story, characters and atmosphere are simply great. It is an open world mystery thriller with a strong resemblance to the TV series Twin Peaks by David Lynch, which is quite unique as far as I know. Apart from the main storyline there are numerous side missions. Most of them are somewhat hidden, but they provide additional understanding of the world (a North-American small town) and the people within it. After many entertaining hours it was hard for me to say goodbye to Greenvale in the end.
3763	1	a	Deadly Preminition is a bizzare game. On paper, it's not that impressive. Dated graphics, awkward gameplay, stiff animations, lack of creature design, various audio and visual bugs to boot. But still there's some charm reminiscent of the David Lynch series Twin Peaks, including a protaganist that feels very influenced by the series itself. I can't really say much more without spoiling some of wackyness and weirdness that goes on within the game itself however.   The Japanese historically haven't had a good time with PC ports (As consoles are the dominant market in Japan) and this game is no different. With repeated reports of not opening (Simple fix, go into your DP files and delete the one for PhysX) and audio and visuals not matching up, but Durante has released some fixes for the game. Which help it a lot with visual resolutions and some of the massively gamebreaking bugs.  It has tons of charm, a great soundtrack and a few moments of 'What the ♥♥♥♥' Worth playing for curiosity alone but I'd wait for a sale on it.
3765	1	a	Do you like weird games? Let me rephrase that. Do you like Resident Evil, Shenmue, Persona and Silent Hill? Do you want to play them at all once?  Deadly premonitions looks bad, controls bad and would overall be a bad game if it were not for the brilliant absudity it offers. Moments of tension and mystery are intersped between hilariously bad writing and super cheesy dilogue. Deadly Premonitions is the rare example of a horror-comedy in video games and is an absoloute must play for anyone. The PC port offers a better control scheme than the PS3 version, but it also comes with it's own limitations. Rising Star gave us one of the worst ports of all time. For some reason the game is locked into 720p and though it touts controller compatability it is entire incompatable with XInput controllers, meaning your 360 or logitech controllers will not work without third party programs. There are a coouple fixes from a clever modder to fix the display issues, but otherwise get the PS3 version instead.
3767	1	a	Well this is the best experience i have ever got from a video game, mixed with some really annoying designer choices. It is absolutely not a game for everyone, but if you can look past the problem on the surface you will find a very interesting and touching story with great characters. Personally, i am not going to forget this game ever.
3769	1	a	plays like Shenmue, If Shenmue were an extremely weird Noir parody/Third Person Shooter/RE4.  one of a kind game with story and world that is well worth putting up with the dated controls, this ain't yo daddy's open world adventure!
3771	1	a	I came in to this game with a lot of doubts, following the comments around the web concerning poor graphics and gameplay mechanics and random crashes. I learned about it when I saw an article about Durante (The guy who fixed Dark Souls on the PC), so when I learned that he was working to fix things, I bought the game right out.  After 20 + hours in game, I can say this is one of the best games I ever played. Sure it has problems, but the excellent script and crazy story, overcome those limitations.  You can make it better in the graphics departement by installing DPfix and SweetFX.  It finally comes down to taste. You will either love this game or hate it. I just love it. :)
3773	1	a	Original story and gameplay. Fantastic soundtrack.
3775	1	a	plays like Shenmue, If Shenmue were an extremely weird Noir parody/Third Person Shooter/RE4.  one of a kind game with story and world that is well worth putting up with the dated controls, this ain't yo daddy's open world adventure!
3777	1	a	I came to this game, as the creator did... directly after watching all of Twin Peaks. I had never seen the show, so I found it more than a little queer to play a game which cribbed so heavily from it; Not to say it doesn't build into it's own thing. It's very unimpressive for a few hours...then... I COULD NOT STOP PLAYING! Francis York Morgan is one of the most dryly hilarious characters ever in a videogame, at least some of which is intentional.  The most annoying parts where driving, especially in rain, and the one hang-up when you are literally fishing for a clue in the investigation. Even though I was sitting there like an ♥♥♥ losing at a roulette wheel repeatedly, I had to know what happened next in this surreal, unpredictable story. It's like the game was written/acted in the 90's with 2003 graphics. It's horrible as a game and highly recommended as a cross-cultural curiosity. The fact that the protagonist talks to a voice in his head, which can double as you, the player, is insanely brilliant. I want to play a solid, polished, 90 metascore game now, but York is calling me back for a second playthrough, 'Are you there, Zach?'
3779	1	a	This game is just amazing! What else can I say? Yes, a bit strange. I mean... I first heard about it from a guy, who played prologue and all the the time said something like 'How glitchy it is' and 'He speaks with coffee??? What a psycho!'. He didn't play after this, but after this 'little conversation' I wanted to play this so much. So I without second thinking bougth this ASAP. And I have never regretted about it.  PS. I didn't have any glitches, so, I think, my friend just had problems with his computer.
3781	1	a	This game is a ♥♥♥♥ing art masterpiece!  So many feelings - it just puts you in right away with all the characters and atmosphere. Lots of laughter, drama, many wtf moments, challenging gameplay, beautiful cinematics and a decent dosage of a cry... One of a kind game, it will go down in the history as one of the most ♥♥♥♥'d up, dramatistic, humoristic and unique games of all time...  A great example that you don't need perfect graphics or gameplay to make a great game, it's all about the originality and creativity, all the bugs n ♥♥♥♥ made this game to what it is!  And yeah, animations &amp; dialogues are ♥♥♥♥ing golden, this ♥♥♥♥ should be nominated for an Oscar! Zach &amp; Francis York Morgan, Max Payne and Alan Wake - perfect combination! :D
3783	1	a	A misunderstood masterpiece about an FBI agent who solves spooky murders with his trusty imaginary friend Zach and his amazing psychic coffe that gives him hints for future events. The game has it all, fishing,driving,shooting,survival horror,eating,sleeping,exploring,racing,puzzle solving,an open world,comedy and drama. It's a game you just have to experience, be warned thought the PC version comes with lots and lots of crashes which will often ruin your amazing adventures with FBI agent York but push on my friend, don't let a bunch of bbbbb----- *error* DP.exe has stopped responding  999999 / 10 This game makes me happy to be alive
3785	1	a	Getting pass a few bugs here and there with the game sometimes crashing after a 'cutscene', the game runs fine.  Graphics aren't the greatest but the story line is where this game really shines. Did not expect the game to last over 10 hours as I did do a few sidequests. The gameplay is pretty generic with a bit of quick time action buttons and inventory management of sorts resident evil style. For achievement hunters, most of the achievements will be from doing the side quests or looking for items scattered around the map so expect to spend over 30 or more hours if you plan on getting 100% in the game. There will be a lot of driving around and there is no GPS guidance other than a huge arrow pointing main quest location, so you will need to use the map occassionally to find yourself around to the next point.  Got the game for free during a bundle promotion, but I would say the game is worth it at a discounted price of atleast 50%. Rating the game 7.1/10 mainly due to the story line being so good, but driving to each point is a hassel.
3787	1	a	It's like Stephen King wrote script and David Lynch directed... (sic!) a videogame! A videogame that didn't suck! Highly recommended!

3793	1	a	I love this game. I've waited a long time to play, and had my prejudices, but I was quickly drawn into the story, it kept me interested all the way to the end. The graphics are sub-par, but that can be partially amended with a tool called dpfix. Acting and writing are hilarious at some points, I have to admit this game isn't really scary - but it delivers a few scares in the combat sections.   Overall, I had a very pleasant experience, I played the game with a walkthrough as I didn't want to miss useful items (or get them too late in the game). Maybe due to that the game hasn't been too difficult, but I don't see that as an issue - it was a very pleasant ride. Side quests are optional, and they do add a bit of game time, but, as mentioned, some yield quite useful items.

3801	1	a	Deadly Premonition is known for being the most polerizing Survival Horror game ever made.  That means people love it or hate it. I personally say this is my 2nd favourite game ever.  The plot goes like this a, girl called Anna has been murdered in the small town of Greenvale and hung to a tree, where 2 small boys called Isaac and Isaiah find her. So the F.B.I send Special Agent Francis York Morgan, to go solve the murder.  So pretty much it is Twin Peeks.   Gameplay and graphics are terrible but, you don't play this for that, you play this for the Fantastic story and characters and dumb dialogue.  Francis York Morgan is probably my favourite video game character ever, next to Raziel of Soul Reaver.  He is Smug and a ♥♥♥♥ to other characters at first. He also talks to himself referring the person he is supposedly talking to as 'Zach' But I will not spoil how that ends. York is a very likeable character, and he has some of the bizarre dialogue you'll probably ever hear.  Speaking of bizarre, the entire game is strange. I can't really explain how. You just have to play it or watch videos on it.   The gameplay goes from linear missions, to Free-roam. The Town of Greenvale is pretty big but navigation is terrible and the map is next to useless.  You probably will learn your way around the town.  Or you can do a side quest that gives you Fast Travel, but by using fast travel you're missing out on the dialogue York says while driving.  While you're driving around York talks to Zach about...Movies. It comes right the ♥♥♥♥ out of nowhere and it's brilliant.   In the Linear missions the game goes all Survival horror on you! 'The game is not scary at all. It is more funny than scary.'  The enemy’s you fight 'all 1 of them' are called Mysterious Shadows.  They look like zombies with clown make up on.  And they make stupid noises when they die.  The shooting works but it won’t blow your mind or anything but it works. Melee weapons work decently.   The game's soundtrack is superb! The music sometimes goes from SUPER SERIOUS!!! To comedy relief.  It's baffling when it happens.  The game in general is 'unintentionally' funny.  The other characters like the sheriff George Woodman and Deputy Emily Wyatt are brilliant.  There is one character called Harry Stewart who wears a Gas mask and doesn't talk.  He has an assistant at all times called Michael Tillotson who talks in rhyme all the ♥♥♥♥ing time.  There is, plenty of other characters too but this would be 5x longer than it already is.   Deadly Premonition as Jim Sterling put it is a beautiful train wreck, so terrible so awful but yet, so beautiful you can't look away. I want everyone to at least try this gem once. You might end up loving it as much as I did. 10/10 Also I would love to thank my good friend Niall for showing me this masterpiece of a gem. Keep your chungus sexy you beast!
3803	1	a	I read about Deadly Premonition before and always wanted to play it, so when i saw it on steam, i immediately bought it, but unfortunately wasn't able to play very far with it's awful keyboard controls. So left it untouched until i got myself a good controller. DP's port is awful, honestly - no proper screen options and locked resolution, so it looked a bit weird on my monitor. A lot of bugs and glitches here and there, and it crashed on me every couple of hours or so, luckily nothing fatal enough to prevent me from beating it. But it did turn the rest of the game into 'from checkpont to checkpoint' and sometimes made me worry about losing my progress more, than about what's actually going on in there. But, aside from all technical troubles, Deadly Premonition is a pure gem. It's weird, it's strange, it's silly and charming, with not that good voice acting, hilarious face animation, great humor, old graphics, memorable characters, amazing soundtrack and interesting story, that will actually hit you in the face with a huge hammer in the last chapters - assuming you didn't give up earlier because of everything above. TL;DR an absolute must-have for everybody, who loves really good stories and can show some patience for clumsy gameplay and technical issues in order to see it all.
3805	1	a	murder in the uncanny valley.
3807	1	a	The most unique game ever made. Mindblowing plot, good humour and awesome atmosphere. Hope i'll see another games like this some day. As for PC port quality, beating all bugs and technical issues totally worth it.
3809	1	a	I cant aim up and I cant re4 shoot a nest 11/10 the coffee didnt warned me about this ♥♥♥♥
3811	1	a	This is one of the most memorable and unique videogames I've played in my life...and believe me, I've played A LOT!  It's really hard to describe what makes this experience work but it does. Is it the atmosphere? Is it the narrative? Is it the characters?  This game is a hit or miss. You either like it or not. As for me, well, I became obsessed with this game while I played it and while I didn't...so much that I went for the 100% completion.
3813	1	a	Despite having no right to be, this is one of my favourite games. It's utterly bizarre but I love it to bits. Please play it. It's a weird gem with some utterly horrible gameplay but it is somehow special.
3815	1	a	I cant aim up and I cant re4 shoot a nest 11/10 the coffee didnt warned me about this ♥♥♥♥
3817	1	a	Now that is a good biscuit. I've never tasted a biscuit this delicious.
3819	1	a	'FBI Special Agent Francis York Morgan. Please, just call me York. That's what everyone calls me.'
3821	1	a	Heyyo, 'Do you feel it, Zach? My coffee warned me about it.' Err... what? lol. Yep! This is a weird game... but weird in a good way. An oddly budget feeling, good way indeed. :P  I want to start this recommendation off with the major strength of this game and what will have you coming back despite the flawed gameplay and that is the story. You play as Fracis York Morgan, 'But please, just call me York. That's what everyone calls me.' Is the main character of the game who came to a small town to investigate a supernatural murder case and try to solve the mystery of why his most recent cases all have red seeds in them and where they are coming from.  The small town is filled with a pretty diverse set of characters and I think that’s the biggest strength in this game. It’s interesting to hear what they have to say and what kind of odd or oddly humorous things they have to say.  The gameplay, as stated earlier? Yep, it’s quite flawed haha. The controls feel a little clunky and the aiming takes a while to get used to and don’t flow as smoothly as for example Resident Evil 4 or 5. The worst offender in the gameplay though? The vehicles. There is a small open town to drive around and the camera can give you motion sickness due to a bug that they never fixed in this port... For example, when you turn your car to the left? The camera pans slightly to the right and vise-versa. It messes with your brain and I found for the first few hours that yes, I was getting headaches or even a little nauseous as you’d expect the camera to pan in the same direction of the vehicle.  Second? The vehicles physics are some kind of weird mix between Mafia 1’s and those budget games you’d find on a rack at a gas station. Vehicles constantly clip in the ground when taking the exploratory paths, taking some corners too fast cause your vehicle to flip way too easily as if the weight of the vehicle is non-existent in this calculation and the engine sounds can sometimes be quite annoying.  So yeah… vehicles? Definitely the worst part of the game. They will annoy the crap out of you. In the PS2 era this game came out? We had good arcade vehicle physics from the likes of GTA 3 as a prime example of how they should have gone about it. But? I don’t know the development cycle and I don’t know their budget (which feels VERY tight btw) so this may have been an area that they didn’t focus in… but at least they should have fixed the damn camera pan when they made this PC port. :P Oh, one warning about this port? It can be quite unstable. As nice as it is you get bonus points for remembering to use phones (to manually save your game) there are times you will get screwed over especially during side-missions where the game will crash and cost you time if you don’t save… so it’s up to you if you wish to use manual or auto saving (toggled in the options menu).  There are guides out there to resolving this, but I found using either Windows XP SP3 compatibility mode or Windows Vista (no service packs) got me through the full game along with this precompiled mod setup found here:  http://www.gog.com/forum/deadly_premonition_directors_cut/essentail_mods   Hope this helps… so says, Mr. Stuart. ;)
3823	1	a	Twin Peaks the game.  Damn fine coffee/10
3825	1	a	-Worth Playing- -I bought it in a Steambundle!-
3827	1	a	This is my 2nd favorite game. My first game is Zombies Ate My Neighbors for thr SNES.   Im hard to impress with any game past the early 2000's so that says something.   Yea, I'm basically a retro hipster ♥♥♥ or whatever they're called.  Edit: I do recommend this game and I ask that people please upvote this so others can see what issues there are. I don't care about uprates on steam or whatever it's called. I don't even understand why people say +rep. I just don't want someone to buy this and then have the same issues I'm having as well as the rest of the players who own this. You can see all the issues just by visiting the community hub and seeing all of the people who have this and other issues. Also the issue I'm about to explain has never happened to me until a week or so ago and I've owned the game since October of 2014 I believe. Seriously view the community hub or read whats below this long boring explanation so you can see what you'll be getting yourself into if you decide to buy this game.  P.S. I bought it on sale for $4.99 so I don't feel like an idiot for buying a game that's buggy as fk compared to paying $24.99 for it which it isn't worth IMO because of all the issues.  I cannot get this game to run whatsoever anymore. Whenever I click play it immediately says 'dp.exe has stopped working' and 1 second or less after that is switches from trying to find the solution to 'close/cancel'.   I have uninstalled and reinstalled the game, verified the integrity of the game cache, I have even watched several youtube videos watching people fix it by clicking on properties - local files - browse local files and then only to see that for some reason no matter how many times I reinstall the game I am missing 3 files inside the local files where you can find the .exe to launch the game aka the binaries folder basically. I ended up downloading dpfix 0.9.5 but that didn't help at all. After downloading the dpfix 0.9.5 I have all the files and tried to start the game. Crashed same as before. I followed the video showing me what to do with the files that I now have. Crashed again the same as before. I've been told that downgrading my nvidia drivers or graphics or whatever it is by 5 updates or so might help but I haven't tried that yet because I just don't feel like doing that atm. I've done several other things but they've slipped my mind atm. If I remember them I will come back and add them.  Link to one of the youtube videos I watched -         YouTube™ Video:  Deadly Premonition Directors Cut Crash Fix&nbsp;
3829	1	a	You play as FBI agent Fancis York Morgan, a delusional man that gets crime clues from his coffee, and talks to his 'imaginary' friend Zach, more than he talks to real people, in front of real people. He's sent to Twin Peaks (can't remember the name of the town, and its twin peaks anyways) to investigate a murder case that seems relate to a killer he's been investigating for some time.  The game is a collision of genres and elements that tries to be so many things at the same times, but really doesnt have the budget or technical prowess to truly be the game it could be...That being said, I enjoyed this game a lot, from its strange characters, that by the end make York look like a normal guy, to the sandbox exploration elements in a nearly lifeless massive town that brings to the table, for no good reason, like everything else in this game, and still works.   This game is a...Sandbox Survival Horror Simulator Adventure Third Person Shooter Fishing Exploration Game with day and night cycles where all characters have their daily routine...What the hell did I just say? And the game totally half asses most of those genres.  A technical disaster that manages to be one of the most unique, funny, weird and all around insane games, Isn't that right, Zach?  I Love it
3831	1	a	I honestly had my feelings about this game constantly change the moment I heard about it. I originally ignored it thinking it wasn't for me, then thinking it wasn't that great. Once the PC version was announced my interest in the game was sparked again, and I looked into it. Eventually got it as a gift on steam cause it was cheap and me and my cousin get each other games for our birthdays, and I am so glad I played it. Now, the thing about this game is the gameplay is not the best part. In fact it's a little weak, fun, but not too strong. It's obvious that they were indeed forced to include the RE4 style combat by the publisher, and I bet the game would've been better if more focus on the breath holding mechanic was your main way of dealing with enemies. Another thing some people might consider weak is the voice acting, and while it is 'bad', a lot of people have such a charm to them that I actually like the voice acting. The games music is also wonderful, especially the classic whistle tune you hear throughout most of the game. The graphics while looking dated, don't look dated in a bad way to me. They give a cozy feeling.  Now outside of things like music, graphics and gameplay, the PC version does have some notable issues. One is the lack of graphics and resolution options, which doesn't bother me but just cause I don't care doesn't mean it isn't an issue. The game also tends to crash, and for a while I had no way of continuing without using another save file ahead of me to avoid a crash, which fixed itself for me but not everyone. I'm not aware of any other issues, but if you find yourself discovering more issues before purchasing the game then look into getting the original release of the game on the Xbox 360, because while it has it's own issues the Director's Cut doesn't have, there are more game crashing, lag and other issues present in the Director's Cut versions of Deadly Premonition than there is in the original version.  In the end, besides that one crash I got which fixed itself I would highly recommend this game, on any platform, just that if you have any issues or don't want to take a chance get the 360 version of the game. If you need strictly good gameplay, which is what I usually need to enjoy a game, then you might want to pass on this game. I normally prefer the gameplay of my game be good, rather than my story or anything else (but music or story being better than gameplay so long as the gameplay is still really really solid works for me as well) but Deadly Premonition is just a case where even with gameplay that's only maybe a 5/10, the rest meshes so well together in a way that I just enjoy spending my time playing this game. I would probably say this is one of my top favorite games of the previous generation. Please do yourself a favor and give this game a try or play it.
3833	1	a	i liked this game a lot and there's coffee and there's trading cards and
3835	1	a	the worst game of the year. buy it right away
3837	1	a	This game is like if Twin Peaks got roundhouse kicked in the face by Shinji Mikami and Suda51.   Weird.....but oh my how amusing.   Get this game     8 out of 10 axe murderers
3839	1	a	Zach needs COFFEE! 8/10 3$ game. Totally worth 3$! If you like horror games then you might enjoy this. Oh and you can shave your face.  People say this is a bad port and it crashes. I haven't had one crash yet. Maybe a sugar crash but thats about it.  Beware this game has alot of cut scenes!    
3841	1	a	This game is too bad to not play.   That said, BUY THIS DAMN GAME.
3843	1	a	This a good ♥♥♥ game!
3845	1	a	This is, in my personal opinion, the best worst game ever. I highly reccomend it... Just make sure you reboot your computer when you first install it
3847	1	a	Worth it just for the ending.
3849	1	a	this game has a great horror story with good gameplay i love the voice acting  this game has its creepy moments and it has its LOL moments  if you want a good horror / crime needs to be solved type of good then look no farther this game is amazing. 85 / 100
3851	1	a	On paper, this game has everything. It's a horror adventure game with an elaborate Twin Peaks-inspired story that takes roughly 20 hours to complete depending on how much time you spend doing sidequests. It's got an open world for you to explore, there's a bunch of ranged and melee weapons, puzzle sequences, hunger mechanic, you name it. The problem is that this game plays and looks like a Playstation 2 game. The graphics are outdated, which wouldn't be too bad if the design wasn't also outdated: it basically plays like a poor man's Silent Hill, and it is full of tedious missions and easy combat encounters.  This PC port is also a mess that is locked to 720p, lacks color filters that the console version apparently had and crashes regularly. You can fix all of this by installing three easy fixes that you can find on the forums, but still. If you want a game that works right out of the digital box and plays like a modern survival horror game, it's hard to recommend this.  Yet, I absolutely loved this game, and it is all thanks to the story and characters. You play as Francis York Morgan, an FBI agent who comes to the small town of Greenvale to solve the murder of a young woman. Sounds familiar? Yes, the game's story is basically a funnier Twin Peaks, and I loved it. It is at times super weird, super funny and super interesting, so it was easy for me to overlook all the shortcomings of the game. The dialogue, story beats and even the cheesy comic relief made this game so easy to enjoy. I just wish this 'Director's Cut' had more stuff to it than extra costumes and some cutscenes, and also made the game look and play a bit better.
3853	1	a	This was... perhaps the best game i ever played so far in my 20 years of age. I might be overreacting but the ending was climatic enough that i liked it quite alot I recomand it either on full retail price or at rebate.
3855	1	a	I have purchased Deadly Premonition on every platform it has been released. The game's director Swery is the perfect kind of crazy, and he's a really sweet guy, and you should all support his work. His games aren't perfect, but they're beautiful windows into his soul. This world we live in does not deserve Swery, and he is a gift. Buy this game and D4, please.
3857	1	a	Deadly Premonition is what you'd get if you asked Suda 51 to direct the new Silent Hill game, as opposed to giving to ♥♥♥♥ing Hideo Kojima of all people. Everyone seems like they're on drugs, the dialogue is janky and awkward, everything is strange and weird. It does add a really nice atmosphere, the deluded sense that something is terrible and wrong but no one else really seems to notice. I mean, more than just a crazy serial killer. Francis York Morgan is a pretty good protagonist, his David Duchovny FBI cool makes him a likable guy and although he as well seems to be on a variety of drugs, he is the most rational and enjoyable to be with. It's one of the best horror games on steam, save for Amnesia and Condemned and is totally worth buying.
3859	1	a	Let me begin by pointing out that this is a terrible PC port. One of the worst I've seen for sure. That said, I was able to comfortably play the game to completion using a mod called DPfix. Not only did this make the game playable, but it also allowed the game to run at a very stable framerate and added support for multiple resolutions. This is important to note because the only other version of this game's Director's Cut available here in the West, namely the PS3 port, suffers from abyssmal performance. With this in mind, the PC version of Deadly Premonition is somehow both the best and worst version of the game. On a personal note, I find this a bit poetic because it perfectly reflects the spirit of the game.  TL;DR The PC port is crap but there's an easy fix that allows for better performance than its console counterparts. For that reason, I can't help but recommend this version over the others.   With that introduction out of the way, let's talk about Deadly Premonition. In short, it's every bit as good, bad, and weird as you've heard. It's an anomoly of a game that really makes you question everything you think you know about what makes a game 'good' or 'bad.' It's completely lacking in polish, yet is so striking in its presentation that it's almost impossible to take your eyes off of it. It casts the broadest net possible over as many genres as it can cover, yet consistently fails to function fully as any one of them independently. It's the only game where you can drive a sports car on two wheels, at 80 miles per hour, to the home of a reclusive gas-mask wearing paraplegic who speaks only in rhyme through his manservant, as weird trance techno blares over the radio, all while your character has a conversation with his imaginary friend about the death of Joey Ramone.  There's nothing I can say that will adequately convey the experience of playing Deadly Premonition, so I won't try any further than I already have. Play it and see for yourself.
3861	1	a	I would keep it short.  PC port is terrible, interface is a bit annoying at times, incredibly odd and strange driving, constant crashes and FPS drops.  But it still one of the best games I've played. Intriguing story, charismatic characters and dence atmosphere is what makes the game this great.  About technical part of the game. The following quotes says it all: 'I would drag my balls through 10 miles of broken glass just to play another 20 mins of this game's story. ' Steam user jerry.   If you are willing to fight the glitches and crashes, you would experience everything that makes this game so great.
3863	1	a	This a good ♥♥♥ game!
3865	1	a	This is, in my personal opinion, the best worst game ever. I highly reccomend it... Just make sure you reboot your computer when you first install it
3867	1	a	I dunno what to say about this game ecxept... Stiff controls, stiff yesteryears animations and stiff voice acting. But it the atmosphere really reeks of an old classic serie called 'Twin Peaks.' I f*cken' it more than putting my d*ck in a cardboard box full of jelly with strawberry taste.  So if you can put your d*ck in it, 'survive' the controls and all the other crap but really love 'old' thriller games with Twin Peaks homage, then you f*ckin' do it.
3869	1	a	Deadly premonition's port to PC is A real hot mess, even with the DPfix for 1080p and controller support is not enough. You still experience massive fps drops do to compatibility issues that can only be resolved by uninstalling most of your media players or changing the codex!  Well... Aside from all that it's really a great game, but only consider buying it on sale. Truly a flawed gem...
3871	1	a	The game works fine for me following these instructions from the forums:  1 - Go to your DP game directory: right click on the game in your Steam Library - properties - Local Files - Browse local files 2 - Launch the 'PhysX_SystemSoftware.msi' file in the 'redist' directory and execute the Uninstall process 3 - Re-launch the 'PhysX_SystemSoftware.msi' to install it. 4 - Now launch the 'PDLauncher.exe' as Administrator.  As for the game itself, the gameplay seems smooth though not entirely intuitive. I tried playing with both the controller and the keyboard/mouse, and definitely recommend the keyboard/mouse. The story seems fleshed out so far, but I will review all this later after I get more hours into the game. I just wanted to put the game fix into a review fairly quickly since the game is available for a sizeable discount right now: $2.49
3873	1	a	The best PS2 game released this gen...just be sure to get the fan-made patch, DPFix.
3875	1	a	Really weird, but ultimately really good. Once you get over the quirks, it turns out to be a really solid game.
3877	1	a	A game where your salary is based on how many monsters you kill, nice story, the best combat system since resident evil 3, totally underrated. Running smoothly on intel hd graphics without using any fixes while the pc masterracef@gs keep whining about crashes/bugs/stuttering.  10/10 would drink their tears. 
3879	1	a	Deadly Premonition is the single greatest mystery adventure game of all time.  That may be a hyperbole statement, but I assure you this is not an exaggeration and I will tell you why you shouldn’t miss out on one of the most uniquely produced games that may never be replicated.  In Deadly Premonition you play as special FBI agent Francis York Morgan (just call him York, everyone calls him that) who has an imaginary friend named Zach, gets paid for shaving his beard, viewing the weather channel and gets advice from his coffee. York goes to Greenvale, a small town where a murder has taken place against a woman named Anna Graham, and it’s up to York, as well as the Sheriff: George woodman and Deputy Sheriff Emily Wyatt to solve the town’s biggest case yet.  Once you're past the intro cutscene, you may think that Deadly Premonition is just a survival horror game that takes cues from other survival horror games such as Silent Hill. However once you complete the prologue thinks get much stranger, weirder and funnier.  The game features dialogue that is both bizarre and completely hilarious usually at the same time, and undermines the games more serious scenes with some of the most amusingly inappropriate music they could think of. For example when York witnesses a murder take place, he will be accompanied by smooth jazz while he makes witty remarks, usually in the same room of the victim. When having lunch York will tell tasteless anecdotes about his past cases, one being where “an ingenious law school student ♥♥♥♥♥ over 800 victims to the people sitting nearby him. Just when you think you’ve seen the strangest part of the game, something stranger pops up not long after.  Deadly Premonition is not only a mystery and survival horror game, it’s also an open world game where you can find collectibles, do side missions, explore the surprisingly large world and do some quests that require shooting zombie like enemies. The driving is hilariously bad and York takes his time to enter and exit the vehicle, however it’s worth it just to hear York talk to Zach about movie trivia and thoughts on the case.  Some submissions can only be tackled during certain times of the day, and usually consists of fetch quests. However doing side missions can net you some goodies, such as a fast travel radio, a submachine gun with infinite ammunition, and trading cards that you can collect.  When you’re not driving around, collecting collectables or talking to the locals, you’ll be doing one of the many shooting sequences of the game that play out a bit like Resident Evil 4. That being said, the combat is very simple and doesn’t get difficult until halfway through the game, despite this these action sequences can be fun as you build up an arsenal of weapons that include pistols, shotguns and machine guns. While you’re shooting enemies you may encounter the “Raincoat Killer who is the mysterious culprit you are after, upon encountering you will either have to do a QuickTime event, run away, or hide in a locker to make sure he doesn’t find you. Even though these sequences are predictable, they can be a good change of pace.  I think I should also mention the graphics; they won’t impress anybody and this was meant to be a Playstation 2 game at one point in development, however the poorly done animations are very comical and had me dying of laughter at points. The sounds are sometimes equally as bad; guns sound like pea shooters and use stock sound effects sometimes and the voice acting is the best kind of bad.  Despite having atrocious graphics, poor sound and simple Gameplay, the game manages to do the whole “so bad it’s good tactic perfectly.  It’s nearly impossible for me to describe some of the more bizarre moments of deadly premonition, but because of the low budget looks and bizarreness of the storyline, Deadly Premonition is one of the most uniquely crafted games I have ever played.  The game excels at providing one of the most bizarre, confusing and entertaining narratives in a computer game, it’s like watching a beautiful train wreck happening on your computer screen, and depending on how you feel, you may even feel a bit emotional at the end of the game, I know I did.  After completing Deadly Premonition, I was sad, very sad, because the main storyline was deemed complete; no game has ever made me laugh so hard to the point of tears more than Deadly Premonition, and it is worth every penny for its comical value.  However I think it’s now time to bring up an issue that plagues the pc port, and that is that it is a poor port that suffers from crashing, fixed resolution and lack of graphical options. If you are going to buy Deadly Premonition, buy it on a console, if you don’t have a console, purchase it on PC and download a few mods to fix the issues.  If you’re curious what Deadly Premonition is ultimately like, Jim Sterling said it best: “Deadly Premonition is like watching two clowns eat each other. It’s perverse, it’s wrong, and yet it’s so ♥♥♥♥ing funny.  There is no other title in the gaming industry that matches the sheer hilarity and bizarreness as Deadly Premonition.  The game is not only so bad it’s good; it’s so bad its borderline perfection!
3881	1	a	What the hell am I playing, and why am I enjoying it so much? I don't even mind the crashes or the fact it needs a third party mod to even get it to load.
3883	1	a	Deadly premonition derives from those loveable 60's B-movie tropes. While not great at a technical standard, Deadly Premonition has some of the most memorable moments in gaming history. A great story, an open sandbox world, interesting characters and a huge variety of other in game tasks to complete besides the main story.  One of the most interesting things about DP (not deep pen) is the atmosphere. Tasked with trying to bring a killer to justice, you and a motley crew of under staffed local law enforces team up to tackle the rain coat killer. A mysterious individual who is going around town killing innocent women. The setting in the game is just amazing. As I said before, it's not a great technical achievement, but it doesn't have to be. Gameplay over graphics is always a motto I have said and stuck by. Set in an idyllic town set in the mountains you generally feel alone and constantly fighting to find out where to take your mystery solving crew next.   One scene has you hiding from the rain coat kliller as he chops down the door with an axe. Do you run? Do you hide? It's frantic and engaging and people will love the humour in this game. It's a light touch that is needed at certain points throughout the game.  This game is an utter joy to play and you will easily get 40+ hours form it. 
3885	1	a	It's a little gift from far away times when gaming was big and grass was green. Firstly I have a really misunderstanding about what hell happend here, but step by step I started to see beyond ugly graphics and awful sound. So you might try to seen what I saw.
3887	1	a	How do I describe this game in one sentence? 'It's so bad it's good.'  Deadly Premonition is a game I have only played for five hours, but am completely in love with. And by all rights, I shouldn't be. The graphics are PS2-era, the combat is mostly a Resident Evil 4-esque 'stand still and aim with a relatively poor laser sight' system against enemies, the voice acting is often laughable, the music is repetitive (I'm pretty sure there are only about five or so tracks) and often plays at the most random and unfitting of moments... It's a recipe for an absolutely terrible game.  In fact, I quit during the first half an hour, regretting my buy. But something... Strange.. Urged me to go back to it. Perhaps it was my desire for a survival horror game that I've never played before, or just that I was bored out of my skull and decided to give it another chance, I don't know... But I'm so glad I did.  The first 20 or so minutes is a really bland, boring, linear shooting section with minamilistic horror at best, but once I got past that, the game, and indeed the world, opened up.   That was my first surprise: the game is open world. It's quite large, too, filled with interesting characters, side-quests and locations to visit. And facial animations, oh lord, those facial animations. The main character sometimes smiles a smile so horrifyingly terrible that I'm almost convinced it's actually a genius ploy by the developers to show how Detective York might actually have some sort of severe autism and is incapable of natural emotion. He sure seems like it, sometimes.  Detective York is the strongest point of the game. An antisocial FBI lone-wolf detective/criminal profiler. York's character ranges from amusing, to awkward, to being an absolute ♥♥♥♥. He's completely foreign to socializing in the 'normal' way and doesn't care to hurt feelings if it furthers his case. He also has a (perhaps unhealthy) interest in the murders of young women, knows everything there is to know about terrible 80's movies and... Oh yeah, did I mention he also talks to himself? The mysterious Zach (who I'm certain is actually supposed to represent the player, but there might be a big twist that I don't yet know about) seems to be some kind of imaginary friend, or split personality, that York often converses with, though you never hear Zach converse back.   York is also an absolute genius, as proven at multiple points throughout the game. He solves riddles, rolls his eyes at stupidity and sees those miniscule details that solves cases that no-one else seems to see. He's also good at reading people, too. This leads on to the second strongest point: the plot. I won't spoil anything, and I haven't gotten too far yet, but so far I'm absolutely enthralled by this game's story. The characters are all memorable (if unintentionally awful and hilarious) and the crime, concerning that of the ritualistic slaying of the town beauty Anna, is brilliantly thought out and genuinely interesting to experience and solve - which is the main storyline of the game.   Gameplay-wise, Deadly Premonition has so far been split into two sections: the 'open-world' section, during which one is free to travel (except for certain missions) around a clearly polygonal and badly textured landscape that is somehow full of character. York can interact with people, go to stores, complete side-missions, solve puzzles and look for clues pertaining to the case. He must also keep tabs on sleep and hunger, which both decrease over time and give debuffs to his stats.   The second section is the combat section, which is almost a dungeon crawl. Here, York encounters supernatural enemies and phenomenom, and has his run-ins with the games primary antagonist, The Raincoat Killer. As explained earlier, this section mostly involves shooting or battering down enemies (with melee weapons that break over time), solving puzzles and finding clues. A friend has told me it also grows to include chase-sequences and hiding-sequences in the future. York also has limited stealth capacity, in which he can hold his breath to become invisible to enemies. This has limited use, but is a good addition non-the-less. Shooting involves standing still and aiming the weapon, though guns have a rather difficult to see laser sight which makes aiming at distance hard. Enemies are zombie-like, but can have sudden bursts of unnatural (and creepy) speed and groan out things like 'don't want to die' when you kill them. The two primary stats in combat are health and heart-rate/stamina. Health is self explanatory, while stamina is interesting in that it contributes to your tiredness, but also decides how long you can sprint and hold your breath. Your stamina recovers quickly when idle, so it's not a big problem.   One of the most interesting things about these supernatural sequences is York's reaction.. Or lack thereof. He doesn't actually seem to give a ♥♥♥♥ that all these completely insane and clearly supernatural-in-origin things are going on. He never reacts negatively, nor does he ever tell anyone or even so much as ask 'did you see that?!'. It's part of his charm, and makes sense in that it adds to the possibility York might actually be a fearless, no-♥♥♥♥-giving psychopath, or at least a cold-hearted ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.   I HIGHLY recommend this game to EVERYONE. This is one of the few games that gets a perfect score from me... An absolute 10/10, despite the poor graphics and PS2-era gameplay.
3889	1	a	I'm only recommending this game is the story behind this game. It it solid mystery, and I will finish the game at some point. What I really don't like are the controls, interface, and gameplay as they are quite lacking (on PC that is.....)  6/10, only because of a good backstory.
3891	1	a	York, I love you man!  There's so much I could say, right Zach?  But mainly...I love York! &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
3893	1	a	I hate almost every mechanic you will find here.  Quick Time Events - Terrible in general and horribly executed here Open World - With Mostly Empty Space is what I automatically read after I see this description and it absolutely appies here Survival Horror - Resource managment that amounts to making sure you have enough food to last the day, the timeless and endless searching for keys to open doors, and being forced to hide from an assailiant in a locker despite the fact that you have 160 rounds in your submachine gun ready to be unloaded.  The combat is TERRIBLE and I was not suprised at all to find out it was tacked on at the last minute to try and appeal to 'western gamers' at the publishers request.  To top it all the optimization is exceptionally poor and will likely require you to download some quickfixes via mods (check forums) to run.  Yet I love this game. It's strange beyond reason and the completely broken parts of the game (almost everything) somehow manage to accentuate the one thing that works with this game. The off-center, campy, almost familiar, touching, and beyond words oddball yet enchancting atmosphere.  Agent York is stranger still than the atmosphere and he's one of the most memorable characters in video games.   This might not be for you but on discount you really need to find out if it might be.  9/10 if it is....
3895	1	a	Any video game that gives you money for shaving and changing clothes is an immediate buy.
3897	1	a	Zach told me too say how good this game is and how it never crashes and all other reviews are lies. But really yes it crashes but there are work arounds from it. Besides that the story is pretty fun and serious at the same time. The gameplay can get alittle repeative at times but most games are like that these days.
3899	1	a	Crashed twice in the first 10 minutes. I got exactly what I wanted from this game.
3901	1	a	The Room of video games
3903	1	a	It's a masterpiece! It's one of those gems you don't notice straight away but one that you will as soon as you start the game, if not, then near the end of thep prologue achievement. If I were to make a list with the top three best games I've played in my life so far, this would be in third place.
3905	1	a	Deadly Premonition is a unique experience that every videogame enthusiast should play.   The game obviously looks a bit rough around the edges and surely doesn't have the tightest controls, but once you get used to it, it will suck you in and never let go until you get to the end.  Its setting is heavily inspired by David Lynch's Twin Peaks, which may be a plus (it is for me), however as the story progresses you realize that it stands on its own and it's actually pretty interesting.  Every character you'll meet has some peculiarity that makes him or her different from the others, and you will likely get attached to York, the protagonist, one of the best playable characters of the last gen, IMHO.  Things I didn't like are basically related to the bad PC port: long loading times even on an SSD, crashes and some problems with getting my gamepad to work.   It was worth the trouble anyway.  Buy this game, you won't get to play anything like this for some time.
3907	1	a	the worst game of the year. buy it right away
3909	1	a	The Twin Peaks vision David Lynch was never able to truly realize
3911	1	a	As I kept playing, I've come to love this game's bulls***t. There's so much to like about it that I found myself ignoring a lot of errors and problems with the game. So, as a video game, this is actually a bad one. But as someone's vision, as a project, it's some kind of amazing.  PS: It's a very bad PC port, but with a quick fix it's playable.
3913	1	a	On paper, this game has everything. It's a horror adventure game with an elaborate Twin Peaks-inspired story that takes roughly 20 hours to complete depending on how much time you spend doing sidequests. It's got an open world for you to explore, there's a bunch of ranged and melee weapons, puzzle sequences, hunger mechanic, you name it. The problem is that this game plays and looks like a Playstation 2 game. The graphics are outdated, which wouldn't be too bad if the design wasn't also outdated: it basically plays like a poor man's Silent Hill, and it is full of tedious missions and easy combat encounters.  This PC port is also a mess that is locked to 720p, lacks color filters that the console version apparently had and crashes regularly. You can fix all of this by installing three easy fixes that you can find on the forums, but still. If you want a game that works right out of the digital box and plays like a modern survival horror game, it's hard to recommend this.  Yet, I absolutely loved this game, and it is all thanks to the story and characters. You play as Francis York Morgan, an FBI agent who comes to the small town of Greenvale to solve the murder of a young woman. Sounds familiar? Yes, the game's story is basically a funnier Twin Peaks, and I loved it. It is at times super weird, super funny and super interesting, so it was easy for me to overlook all the shortcomings of the game. The dialogue, story beats and even the cheesy comic relief made this game so easy to enjoy. I just wish this 'Director's Cut' had more stuff to it than extra costumes and some cutscenes, and also made the game look and play a bit better.
3915	1	a	For a game that has problems with its pc port, it's a fun pc port, especially for certain things such as the diner conversation or when York holds his own conversation about films. If you want to make sure it plays smoothly and with a different resolution, you will have to modify the game. Here's a guide for anyone interested:  http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Deadly_Premonition:_The_Director%27s_Cut   In terms of gameplay, combat is rather ordinary, playing like Resident Evil 4 with the over-the-shoulder aiming. Driving is a bit wonky, especially if you drive the car from using the flare (Compared to the police car, the speed is rather fast as though York decided to floor it.). QTE's exist and they require some quick input. Outside of combat, the game does give players side activities to do.  Also, the coffee says 'F.K.'
3917	1	a	0/10, 10/10.
3919	1	a	Never played it on the XBOX so I have no say on the port. It is pretty bad though. THAT BEING SAID. This game is perfect in every way, right Zach?
3921	1	a	Will forever change the way you drink coffee.
3923	1	a	Now I'm not going to lie to you, the gameplay in this game is trash. Serious trash. You are cemented to the floor while shooting, there are only 2/3 different types of enemy in the game, sound effects are awful, the driving is hilariously bad as you fly around at 80mph spinning in circles and it crashes so much that you'll want to cry after the 10th time.  BUT, it's still a damn awesome game. How the heck does it manage that you ask? With some of the most hilarious dialogue I've heard in a video game and some of the most interesting and fleshed out characters which feel like they could actually exist in the real world, which doesn't really happen too often in video games.  If you can look past the gameplay issues and immerse yourself in the stories and the characters, you'll definitely have an amazing time.
3925	1	a	From the very start of the game (albeit after fixing the crash issues) I was hooked. A survival horror game with elements of comedy, with an open world environment and a charismatic protagonist makes it a cult favorite. The games story (for a brief summary you are an Special FBI Agent investigation an interesting murder case) gives you a lot of clues and expansive knowledge for the player to deduce and question who did it with so many suspects you'll be sure to doubt your prime suspects, but do not fret as the pieces will fall in place nicely and pave a wonderful intense and dramatic story.   This game deserves a 10/10, however due to the pc port issues, bugs, and numerous crashes it recieves a 8/10.

3929	1	a	Worst game i've played in my life. Best game of all time.  0/10 10/10  You will suffer it like a torture. You will enjoy it like an org*sm.  You will NEVER forget it.  Don't ask. Just play it.

3935	1	a	its a masterpiece  ignore the people who say the game is unfinishable btw, the port is far from a masterpiece but apart from the memory leak it runs with few problems, seriously, people are just too lazy to do any fixes and just say avoid. also back up your save at chapter 9
3937	1	a	Litterally the best game ever.
3939	1	a	I dunno what to say about this game ecxept... Stiff controls, stiff yesteryears animations and stiff voice acting. But it the atmosphere really reeks of an old classic serie called 'Twin Peaks.' I f*cken' it more than putting my d*ck in a cardboard box full of jelly with strawberry taste.  So if you can put your d*ck in it, 'survive' the controls and all the other crap but really love 'old' thriller games with Twin Peaks homage, then you f*ckin' do it.
3941	1	a	Clunky combat, weird out of place humor, goofy main character, and self aware side characters. Mix this up with fairly bad performance, terrible terrible driving physics, hard crashes, and what do you get?  A game that ends up being good despite the flaws. Pick it up today!
3943	1	a	Do you like Twin Peaks? Do you like charmingly weird stories and characters? Are you prepared to take the strangest yet most investing story you've ever seen? If you answered yes to any of these questions, pick this game up immediately.
3945	1	a	One of the most enjoyable games i've every played. A little clunkly, but the whole thing is written with a lot of heart which is something you don't see enough of. Technically a horror game i guess, but overall has a really nice laid-back atmosphere which isn't something you might expect from this sorta game. Comparisons to Twin Peaks and Resident Evil are inevitable, but it has a real unique flavor of its own which is where the game really shines.  (plus this game seems to go on sale often for just a few dollars so it's a great cheap buy if want to wait)
3947	1	a	Basically Twin Peaks fan fiction, and I mean that as a good thing.
3949	1	a	Plays like crap, looks like crap... Probably would smell like crap.  Awesome game though.
3951	1	a	Worst game i've played in my life. Best game of all time.  0/10 10/10  You will suffer it like a torture. You will enjoy it like an org*sm.  You will NEVER forget it.  Don't ask. Just play it.
3953	1	a	You can drink coffee and catch criminals  10/10 would drink again
3955	1	a	This game is, sure, weird. But nice. It's nicely weird. And weirdly nice. As the console port it has a lot of bugs and glitches, it has it's undeniable flaws and till the very end it's impossible to decide if it's serious game or is it some kind of a parody. It's also impossible to stop playing, to stop enjoying the characters and the story that is weird... but nice. That is why I love japanese games so much - they can be weird, but they would leave nice aftertaste. For sure.
3957	1	a	Gets paid to shave, still bothers to investigate.  10/10  Would shave again.
3959	1	a	great game when it works, unforgettable story 10/10
3961	1	a	Definitely one of my fave games so far. It really reminds me of Resident Evil 4 and Twin Peaks. The controls may be awkward, but it'll take getting used to. The soundtrack is fire, fam. Also, download DPFix, it works wonders and actually gets the game to run at 1080p. Performance is meh on my GTX 970.
3963	1	a	Legendary game.  Twin Peaks, if interpreted by an unrestricted Japanese developer. It’s a mystery-adventure game, not exactly a horror title. I'd say it shares more with Shenmue than Silent Hill. The cast of the game and their interactions provide for some of the most memorable game moments. Unfortunately gameplay, in terms of combat, lacks polish and will be considered abysmal by some.  If you want something different, a game that provides something far from Ubisoft's triple-a game dispenser products, give this one a shot. (The definitive version is the Xbox 360 version)  My favorite game of all time. My comfy game.

3967	1	a	Possibly the only game where I feel the need to watch every movie mentioned by a single character.  
3969	1	a	I give it a solid 420 out of 10.
3971	1	a	Its A Good Game.. Rminds Me Of The First Silent Hill The  Way The Game Play Is An Old School.. Resident Evil On How Slow The Doors Open.. An Your Character Zach He Always Has To In Second Person It Gets Old... But It Is A Game To Own Not To DIE For!!!!!!!!
3973	1	a	Best Crashing Simulator Ever
3975	1	a	THIS GAME AIN'T WORK FOR ♥♥♥♥
3977	1	a	What I thought was the worst game ever turned out to be the best game ever. I love it and will rub the physical copy on my body every night.
3979	1	a	I play this game on a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ laptop, have no crashes and stable FPS, guess you have to tune in with the mood of the game even IRL.   Game itself is weird, but interesting so far. Controls could be better, just don't play on keyboard.  All around 8/10 so far, guess in the end will be 11/coffee 
3981	1	a	Never before have I experienced such an awful, weird but utterly amazing game. This game really is so bad, it’s good.
3983	1	a	Probably one the most abysmal PC ports ever made (even worse than the Dark Souls port), although it varies between PC's in how it performs. First half of the game gave me random crashes, second half would slow down gradually the more new areas I loaded into.  But this game is amazing. It's amazing amazing. You must remember or heard of Destructoid's Jim Sterling giving it a perfect 10/10? Yeah, I don't like him either, but now that I have gone back and read his review, it makes perfect sense. Also, if you love Twin Peaks, you can't help but fall in love with this game either. Not only does Deadly Premonition have an excellent soundtrack, story, and characters that just feel so real, natural and quirky, but it doesn't forget itself as being extremely videogamey in every sense of the word or feeling, however you want to interpret that. The only cons I can think of would be the possible issues (or no issues) you might have with the port, the game looking like it released late Xbox generation, and mediocre filler shooting sections.
3985	1	a	Simply a masterpiece! The story keeps you playing this game, no matter how bad the controls and graphics are.
3987	1	a	B U Y in THE COFFEE. Zach? I should I buy this game? YES!
3989	1	a	I made this short because people should know about this game. The story is amazing... it is probably one of the best game I have ever played. The only problem is that the port is terrible but if you ok to deal with it. You will not regret it at all... the story will make you play all the way to the end.
3991	1	a	Now before I say that this game is fantastic here's a fair warning and a bit of advice. This game is filled with a ton of issues similar to Dark Souls, it may not have GFWL but instead you must run it on Windows 98 if you don't want it crashing on you all the time. There is a Dark Souls patch as well from the same guy for this game. Now even with all of its issues this is the definitive version to play due to the poor framerates the PS3 version of Director's Cut receives.  Imagine that old David Lynch classic Twin Peaks was made in to a game, sure there's Alan Wake with all of its homages but what if it was a full blown video game. This is exactly what that game would be, it may be from a Japanese perspective but it's all there. The mysteries, the drama, the characters, the large open world in a small countryside town. What it lacks in graphics and gameplay it makes up for with charm. All the characters have their quirks and the world feels alive. You can spend plenty of time in the world without participating in the crime. This is a game made for fans of Twin Peaks. It's still possible to enjoy without watching the show but you might not be able to fully appreciate this beauty and it may be very difficult to get in to. I would recommend this to any fan who just want to relax in this fantastic simulator.
3993	1	a	Look at this weirdo, Zach. He doesn't own Deadly Premonition.
3995	1	a	B U Y in THE COFFEE. Zach? I should I buy this game? YES!
3997	1	a	Simply a masterpiece! The story keeps you playing this game, no matter how bad the controls and graphics are.
3999	1	a	It's one hell of a cup of coffee.
4001	1	a	This game looks like crap, plays like crap, craps out a lot, lots of crappy glitches, and yet is one of the best pieces of crap I've ever played. Just expect a lot of weirdness in this crap. I recommend only for its story.
4003	1	a	This is a great game with a good mixture of gore,horror,and comedy but is able to crash so badly and it's lags so bad 
4005	1	a	Deadly Premonition oscillates between brilliant and tedious. In terms of quality this game is hard to recommend, but if you give it a shot the game will surprise you with intriguing story, of wich you might fall in love with this game.
4007	1	a	*whistles Super Mario World theme*
4009	1	a	This is a pretty neat game.
4011	1	a	Evah emos eeffoc Kroy. Siht si a eurt egamoh ot esoht no Niwt Skaep! Ahahahahahah! There are too many flaws to this game than I can count but I guess thats the charm of it. The show its based on had numerous flaws too but thats exactly why I like it so much. Both were about failure in the face of evil although you do eventually succeed in this game. Both have well crafted characters. Grab if you are a fan of the strange. You will not be disappointed.
4013	1	a	I seem to be one of the lucky few who has not experienced a crash or problem of any kind while playing this wonderfully strange game. The game itself is amazing in its unique way if you can get it to run. I highly recommend it as it's a game that exists in a class all its own. The characters are odd, different from one another, genuine, and full of quirk and personality. The story is intriguing and the music helps heighten the drama and mystery. It's like a really great, really strange TV show that you get to play through. Even the bad parts like the driving mechanics are enjoyable. It really feels like you're in a small town living the life of an eccentric FBI investigator. So, as long as you can get it to run properly, you're in for the weirdest treat available in gaming that I know of. Enjoy!
4015	1	a	Probably the greatest story ever told. And by told I mean straight ripped of of Twin Peaks. But still great. The humor is quirky, the characters are memorable. The gameplay leaves a little something to be desired, but most of the issues from the original version have been fixed. Play it once, love it forever. An eternal favorite.
4017	1	a	downloaded the game &amp; it wont work, im installing it again to see if that helps &amp; it says it requires 6.6gig but when i go to manage download its telling me the game's 5.5.... help
4019	1	a	This game was stupid. I loved it.
4021	1	a	You play as an autistic detective in this game.
4023	1	a	The PC controls are massively clunky; it's hard to get through a lot of the scenes with the way it was structured and definitely feels as if it requires a controller. Even playing around with the settings makes it agitating.  The game experience is enjoyable if you can manage to get through the awkwardness of it.
4025	1	a	Just got this title free with 10$ indiegala purchase and decided to install it. got constant crashes with the EXE. I managed to get it working by going into the games redist folder and running the PhysX_SystemSoftware exe in it and ran the vcredist_x86 exe. seems to work good so far. If this is helpful feel free to send me some game gifts? lol worth a shot. 
4027	1	a	Struggled to get it working initially, but this game is inexplicably terribly made and a great experience.
4029	1	a	Probably the best game ever made.
4031	1	a	Gloriously terrible, I had a great deal of fun with this game due to the campy and strange humor that is thrown about in the game. I got hooked on it very early into the game but felt a little let down by the ending, this isn't a game for everyone and it's replay value is very minimal.
4033	1	a	Though for some reason I get terrible frames in this game (not optimized still?), I can't not recommend this game to fans of old Sega Dreamcast openworld adventure/mystery games (Shenmue, Blue Stinger, etc.). The music along with the dialogue is GOLD, if you're into more surreal, awkward humor. This game has gotten me to watch Twin Peaks, which I had previously refused to do, it's that infectious. Deadly Premonition certainly isn't for everyone and needs a special kind of eye to appreciate everything it has going for it. 9/10
4035	1	a	Definitely one of the most unique games: Deadly is a game that despite its many flaws, is worth playing. As many other people have said, it's so bad, it's good. The plot is bizarre, with odd twists and turns, though it does borrow heavily from Twin Peaks. However, it actually comes together quite nicely in the end and is certainly one of the most memorable I've seen in years. The gameplay reminds me of Majora's Mask, with the variety of side-quests that depend on the time of day.  Admittedly the gameplay can be cumbersome, and some of the side-quests are way more frustrating than they should be because of it. Also, there are a number of technical difficulties (I've died a few times by falling through the floor). However, if you can get past those annoyances, it's a game that is worth your time.
4037	1	a	Spooky, funny, baffling... sometimes all at the same time. This game is fun to explore.
4039	1	a	Why is this game so good? I have no ♥♥♥♥in' clue, it just IS!
4041	1	a	Deadly Premonition is a beautiful train wreck. At first you don’t want to look at it but playing on, you can’t look away. The murder mystery plot is bonkers but when the story comes full circle has a almost stunning degree of cohesion to it. The gameplay is clunky and the visuals feel sub PlayStation 2 era but it doesn’t matter because all these elements bizarrely work.  
4043	1	a	absolutely fantastic.  Everything about this game walks a fine line of self awareness. Things don't always make sense at first, but it pays off by the end.  I recommend playing it with a controller, it makes combat much much easier. This game has a reputation as a so bad it's good game. Strangely, by the end it became a just good game. York is a magnificently engaging character, and all the supporting cast is various levels of endearing. It's wonderful.  Be sure to do all the side missions! Just doing the quest is okay but there's a lot of payoff by helping the towns people.
4045	1	a	A great game with extra staff . you should buy it .
4047	1	a	dude its great so ♥♥♥♥ alan wake
4049	1	a	this game is bat squeak crazy and for some reason i can't stop playing
4051	1	a	Funny and quirky all of the way through. 
4053	1	a	This is the greatest achievement mankind has ever made. The pyramids of giza, the Collossus of Rhodes, the Empire State Building, and the whoopie pie combined cannot even begin to match the absolute perfection and impressiveness of this game. 10/10 would play with my dog.
4055	1	a	Very bug ridden game with terrible gameplay mechanics, shooting straight outta RE4, dressing system that does nothing. And the game looks like a PS2 era release. That being said it's one of my most favorite games ever released, horrible PC port though and that makes me sad, the games quirks all come together to make a very compelling story, finding out who did the murders was a thrill ride up until the very end. I'd say, if you can don't buy for PC but if it's your only option look for bugfixes, it's honestly a solid bar of gold under all the ♥♥♥♥ on top of it. Rarely will you find a game as great as this one.
4057	1	a	Just the best.
4059	1	a	I cried 20 minutes at the end. 10/10
4061	1	a	If you love Twin Peaks, then you'd love this! This is basically Twin Peaks the game. Am I right, Zach?
4063	1	a	This game is like an alien, I don't know how to describe this game in another way. XD  The graphic are not terrible ( feel like it's PS2 games ), but the characters are not that bad, I mean like York is not the most pretty character but still with time I start to like him, Emily are really cute too ^^, the animations, well sometime they are okay and many times are really weird and you feel like your are in a town of robots.  The voices are sometime not great sometime I forgot that point since I focus on what they said.  The controls are not that great.  And still if you survive all of that and you're like me and prefer to focus on the good points, I think we have a game with many good idea, you explore the town, learn about peoples around, what they do, the secret of the place. You take care of the character, eat, sleep, clean him ( shave him actually ) or his clothes ( have a night with a character with fly around because your clothes are dirty it's really weird and funny XD ). I like when York talk about movies, musics, old cases. I still don't have finish the game but I really want to know the end of this investigation.  So, I can't blame peoples who will hate this game because it's some kind of ugly for a 2013 games, but at the same times I now know what so many peoples recommend this game and me too I now recommend this game if you can deal with his 'bad' side ( 'bad' side who are for me like a bad horror movies but who are actually good because it's the style of the movie ).  A deadly premonition 2 with better graphic and animation with the good idea of this game could be a big hit I'm sure. :)
4065	1	a	This game can be summed up pretty easily: Twin Peaks plus zombies. 
4067	1	a	When I finished this game I didn't know whether to ♥♥♥♥ or wind my watch but i loved every bit of it.
4069	1	a	Deadly Premonition is one of the strangest games I have played. It has terrible graphics, a story largely ripped straight from Twin Peaks, combat that is so easy it feels tacked on, bad driving controls, and terrible sound design among other things. In the end though I enjoyed it enough to finish the game with all the side missions completed and I even got the 65th trading card. It isn't by any means a good game, but something about it just makes it fun. This is very much a video game equivalent of a cult film. Anyone who enjoys the sound of that should give the game a try.
4071	1	a	Before I begin, I owned this on Xbox and recently started playing through the PC version.  I'm not sure I can say Deadly Premonition is good, but at the same time it is. I've used 'disgustingly average' to describe it before. Yet, I can't recommend it enough. Its basically Twin Peaks the game, in a sense.   If you like horror, or action, or story, this is a game for you. The game has many flaws. The driving sucks, the combat could be a little better, the squirrels make MONKEY noises. But, those make Deadly Premonition what it is.   This game is basically the definition of 'So bad it's good'
4073	1	a	It's hard to talk about Deadly Premonition without sounding like everything you're saying is at best half-serious. I'll try anyway:  Deadly Premonition is one of the best games from the past five years or so I've played. It certainly doesn't show from the clunky controls or often-bizarre graphics, but somewhere around the midpoint of the game I realized that it manages to push past 'so-bad-it's-good' into territory of being actual, just-regular-type good.  Deadly Premonition uses the medium to tell a story surprisingly well, and even though it's obviously not for everyone (You will almost certainly love or hate this game), it's legitimately better than you might first expect.
4075	1	a	I'm a weird individual and this is a weird game. So the two of us got on like a house on fire. Due to the low budget, the gameplay mechanics, graphic and sound aren't all that refined. Despite all that this game has charm and a lot of it. Its twin peak setting is pretty unique and there is lots to do in this open world survival horror. In fact this is the first true open world survival horror game I can think of (Silent Hill doesn't count). Despite the simple gameplay mechanics it does play like resident evil 4 with its over the shoulder gunplay. While the controls really need sorting out, the game is still fun to play. However while the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions have a few glitches, this PC port has lots. There is nothing game breaking but you will find a lot of missing textures, frame rate problem and sometimes mechanical problems like the controller not being responsive. This is best played with mouse and keyboard because the controller controls are clunky and are pretty much broken for the most part.   Despite all its flaws I had a hell of a time playing this. There is a reason why I have bought this on every platform and that reason is because of its originality. Swery65 is basically suda 51 and Hideo kojima as one. He has a vision that only Suda 51 can understand and he has the ambition of Hideo Kojima. He is pretty much the perfect developer and D4 looks like it will kick the walking dead's ♥♥♥♥.   I hope the will be a sequel or a prequel so that I can witness this experience again.
4077	1	a	Probably the best game ever made.
4079	1	a	Probably the best game i have ever played in my life, or TOP 3 material. This game is something superb, i fell tottaly in love with it. It did have great music, story, characters...WOW. On the other hand, the technical aspect of the game is really TERRIBLE, and i am not talking about minor problems, it is really badly done, really. I was lauhing at it first, but my friend really pushed me to play it, and now, after finishing it, i can say, that that was one of the best things i ever played, if not the best. (and i played Fallout, Planescape torment and almost all legends made). This game just was really special.
4081	1	a	Mr. Francis York Morgan  Deadly Premonition is GOTY for sure If you're tired of boredom then here is the cure If you don't believe me just buy it and see Now you can play it on your PC  So says Mr Stewart.
4083	1	a	I've loved the style of the game ever since I saw a playthrough for it. Even being spoiled for the game, the quirky and weird storyline is wonderful. The insight into characters, the odd sidebar comments from the main character, the side quests, and more, were a sure-in for me in terms of whether I should buy this. I'm a sucker for the odd, dark, weird, and gortesque so your mileage may vary in terms of how you may enjoy the story.  A few things to note in terms of game play and PC port issues that I've read about before purchasing:  I seem to have won the Russian Roulette of PC port issues. The game has only crashed on me twice so far and both times was because I didn't save for too long. On that note, I don't have the unofficial patch installed. As for the screen revolution issue, I bought the game after the official patch (v1.01b) came out, so I didn't encounter the 720p issue. It's sizable and both full screen and windowed mode works well on my 1366 x 768 screen. (The only downside is you can't change the resolution. Only tab between full screen or windowed.) If I play it on windowed mode, I have to autohide my windows taskbar for it to fit. That's about it.  Some gameplay advise (with minor gameplay spoilers) starts here. If you're the kind who likes to do sidequests and get all the side achievements or like to explore, read on! Because I had to restart the whole game because of this issue.  There are a few short story-only chapters where you can run around the game area and accomplish tasks. However, the game doesn't tell you this. You can progress through the whole story without completing the side quests at all. But if you do like to do side quests, it's best that you find a good non-spoiler walkthrough that'll tell you when and where to do what. The game has a replay function but the downside to replaying a chapter is you CANNOT save at all during the replay; with the game's tendency without notice as well as the very specific conditions you need for side quests, it can be a huge bummer.   I found this out at chapter 4 and decided to restart the whole game so I can have the chance to save between side missions. That's about it from me so far. I love the game overall and I'm just very happy to get to play it on a platform I own.
4085	1	a	You'll have the best worst time of your life trying to follow this game &lt;3 10/10 Best Game Of The Ever
4087	1	a	WHAT THE HELL IS MY LIFE  This game is incredibly stupid  Seriously, in retrospect it's horrible  It begins with lots of laughs but the last three or so hours are insane  Yeah go play it or something
4089	1	a	Highly underated on release. This game is unlike any other. Quirky small town Amrerica meets Resident Evil. True, the graphics are basic and the controls can feel a little clunky but if you like narrative and dark plot this game is a must. Ignore official reviews, enjoy this experience
4091	1	a	The production values are last gen, the dialouge is goofy and awkward, the voice acting flip flops between lazy and hammy as hell, and yet...well, somewhere around the second hour this game transformed from a seemingly 'me too!' survival horror game to one of the most engrossing open world titles I've ever played. It's been a said a million times, but there seriously isn't anything else like it this gen, and it's more than worth plowing through, if for it's lead character (who is one of the most bizarre and awkward video game protagonists I've ever seen) and it's, despite all odds, more often than not intriguing murder mystery.
4093	1	a	This game is one of my personal favorites from the (360,PS3) generation. It might not look like much, but if you go beyond it's low end graphics and controls, there is a special thing about it and that special thing is what made it a cult hit.
4095	1	a	dude its great so ♥♥♥♥ alan wake
4097	1	a	This game... It's just weird, in a good way. Kind of like Twin Peaks. If your into horror games and want to try a game that's out there. Pick this one up, it will not disappoint.
4099	1	a	Just the best.
4101	1	a	I cried 20 minutes at the end. 10/10
4103	1	a	Cult favorite and holds a record of most polarizing game ever and the 'best-worst game of this generation'... Quirky, scary, weird and at some points perhaps unintentionaly comedic but perhaps that is what makes this game special. Yes It may have awkward controls and other miscellaneous problems but the PC version helps amend these so I recommend if your a fan of survival horror/ weird games or love a plot that is actually compelling and complex like this hindered-masterpiece.   Supports Window Mode. Has controller compatibility. Changeable Graphic resolution.
4105	1	a	'Do you feel it, Zach? My coffee warned me about it.'
4107	1	a	F... K... IN the coffee?!?  Looking past the clunky graphics, gameplay and execution this is a passionate game made with the best intentions with the least cynicism I've seen in a game in years.  Obviously Twin Peaks inspired, it won't appeal to everyone but to those it does I can guarantee you'll become a Swery fan.
4109	1	a	I went open minded to this and i must say...I freaking love it so much! I rarely judge a game based on its bugs or crashes, I mostly care about the gameplay and the story, the gameplay is alright, reminds me of a mix between Resident Evil 4 and Silent Hill, and the story so far is amazing! The humor is awesome, the characters are original and really know how to make you love them, specially the main character...Ahhh York! &lt;3 The soundtrack altough repetitive is pretty cool sometimes, specially the whistling one, i whistled along everytime!  In general, if you ignore the sometimes annoying random crashes and the bugs, and you love a good mistery/horror/open world game, this game is perfect for you!  8.5/10 so far! :)
4111	1	a	Brilliant writing. Excellent atmosphere. Gameplay is far from unbearable, though not perfect.  The story and its execution are what make this game, it's relatively long, but you'll get so hooked you won't even notice.  9/10 - Jerky controls, but amazing story and greatly explorational.
4113	1	a	Positives: Fantastically weird characters, and dialog. Very Twin Peaks inspired setting. Some decently creepy moments. Absolutely deranged music.  Negatives: Dated visuals. Slightly clunky controls. Absolutely deranged music (sometimes it can be annoying!)
4115	1	a	When I finished this game I didn't know whether to ♥♥♥♥ or wind my watch but i loved every bit of it.
4117	1	a	I thought I was getting a horror game. I got a driving game, a typing game, a fishing game, a dressup game, a shaving simulator, and Twin Peaks with the serial numbers ever so lightly filed off. 10/10
4119	1	a	Deadly Premonition is the vieo game verson of Twin Peaks but with a supernatual twist and a japanese charm. Recomended if you like small town murder mysteries with bizzar characters and if you like the odd obscure Japanese game.
4121	1	a	Well Zach, this could have gone better, couldn't it have? The good news is that the game runs pretty smoothly now, and there is a patch that lets you crank up the resolution. However, this game never had good looking assets. If that matters to you, then wait a few months to play this because I'm sure someone will make better textures. But this game isn't about the graphics, it never was. I got this for 5 bucks from indiegala, but at $15 or less I'd call this a buy.
4123	1	a	You may think when you see this game is just a crappy game. But if you dig deeper and play the game you will find out that the game has an amazing story. If you ignore the combat and the driving and graphics you will find an amazing game.
4125	1	a	A rich, story driven action-horror game with decent, pseudo-RE4 controls and great commidic relief, Deadly Premonition is a MUST HAVE for ALL gamers.  10/10 would buy again.
4127	1	a	Do you want to play a game that feels, plays and tells a story like David Lynch's Twin Peaks? This is it.  But like Lynch's cinematography this game will leave you alone confused after it crashes (which it will - several times), so replay that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ part again and listen to York's babbling - again. So in simple words: this game is poorly made gameplay or mechanics wise, as well as graphics, sound mixing, just everything. The thing is: it tells you a story with rich but utterly strange characters like in Twin Peaks (or in videogames like Alan Wake's Latern Lady), which keeps you interested and motivates you to get through this nightmare of game. Whatever it throws at you, you will still appreciate this game and its charme. For me it's an classic ♥♥♥♥♥♥ arthouse-trash game. I love it. Isn't that right, Zach?
4129	1	a	May not work right out the box kind of game. DPFix was a pretty big help when it first came out on steam and continues to fix things so I would recommend getting that. The game itself finally comes with controller support and patched a few bugs which really hindered the game. Interestingly enough this game was tested with windows 98 and if you have serious problems you may want to put it in compatibility for win 98.   Probably the weirdest game I have played in a long time. It is a budget game and has its moments of being cheesy and surprisingly good. Mixed on the gameplay aiming is like resident evil 4, hilariously bad driving and annoying qtes. Nothing challenging about the game except maybe getting it work especially when it first came to PC. I enjoyed the game enough where I would probably play it again.
4131	1	a	Twin Peaks gone Silent Hill, as realized by a Japanese dev team on LSD. There are plenty of flaws, even discounting the terrible porting job, but underneath it all is an awkwardly endearing and clearly ambitious hodgepodge of a game. The writing is occasionally quite clever and humorous, the characters grow on you and are surprisingly multidimensional. The story, while full of plot holes, is still interesting enough that it kept me going. And while it's usually easy to guess what happens next in the grand scheme of things, the details are usually completely unexpected. Especially when it comes to dialogue.  It's easy to see why everyone won't give this one a chance though. Production quality varies heavily. Many environments are incredibly detailed, characters are mostly well modeled, and voice acting is at least bearable and often genuinely decent. On the other hand character animations are often awful and level design is mostly uninspired and occasionally very annoying. This goes double for the corridors you end up traversing when the game switches to otherworld mode. There are occasional environmental puzzles that have no particular reason to be there. They're always easy but also almost always annoying.   Combat is trivial, at least when played with a mouse, so the Silent Hilly otherworld bits where you shoot your way through endless mobs turn into routine that you have to turn your brain off for to get to the story bit on the other side. It's not actively terrible but you get the feeling the otherworld fighting stuff was meant for some other game entirely. But then, that goes for many things in the game. There are also useless combat-related QTEs which range from irritating to really bloody annoying, depending on whether you see them coming and whether you remember which buttons you need to press in which order to avoid being instakilled by one of the baddies that haunt your persistently through the game.  The freeroam stuff, while novel, also doesn't work too well as there isn't much of interest to actually do. The things you can do are also usually pointless from a gameplay perspective. Unless you really like increasing your Agent Honor by driving over medals in forest corridors, that is. Driving in general is something you will spend a lot of time doing, and you will not enjoy it.  Thankfully the devs realized driving around is boring (unless you play with a keyboard and mouse, then it's a constant life and death struggle to just stay on the road) and recorded tons of monologues where the main character reminisces about pop culture with his invisible friend. These give the driving segments a lighter tone and also help deepen the player character. Unfortunately the devs didn't consider how aggravating it is to listen to one single repetitively terrible cop show theme whenever your character doesn't happen to be talking about 80s B-movie rentals. A car radio would have been an amazing addition, even just so you could turn it off.  The music in general deserves a few comments. The number of tracks is way too low and many scenes have incredibly ill fitting tunes. Some of it is probably intentional humor, but it's impossible to tell. However some of the tracks are genuinely very good. Everything gets repetitive real quick though. You always know what sort of scene is about to start when you hear the music start to play. Well, except for that one experimental jazzy tune which is used completely randomly.  Basically, if you can enjoy diamond-in-the-rough style games, and find amusement in weird things both intentional and unintentional, and enjoyed the general atmosphere of Twin Peaks, this may be a game for you. Or not. The divisive reputation is certainly well deserved as even though I've spent quite a number of hours in it, it's still hard to recommend the game to anyone that isn't me.
4133	1	a	If you love Twin Peaks, then you'd love this! This is basically Twin Peaks the game. Am I right, Zach?
4135	1	a	My coffe made me play this game. And I don't regret a single moment spent playing it. The graphics are awful, the gameplay is horrible and sometimes frustrating, but the story makes you forget about the game's flaws. Twin Peaks like characters and setting, crazy dialogues, surprisingly good score. Go play it. Now.
4137	1	a	I love this game, it is one of the few games I have gotten all achievements with and I'm playing it all over again. Yes, there are holes, mighty big ones in fact, but it actually makes the game shine.   Here's a list as to why it sucks: Crashes often Plot is barely explained Plot holes Graphics are terrible Controls (on the xbox) are weird (LB to sprint?) [Also if you are playing with an xbox controller DO NOT I repeat DO NOT change the buttons, it does not work with the new scheme] Sound effects are weird and confusing at times (Squirrels make monkey noises apparently) Voices are not that great (What's with the reverb?) Hit boxes are confusing for both character and enemies (I got the lazer sword and cannot use it because of the hit boxes and because I get grappled too often) Weapons are okay (Some are difficult for me to use) AI is weird Slow spawning (for the Hell Dogs that is...) Car controls are abysmal (I can do a 360 in the air both forwards and sideways) There's a bar for everything (sleep, food, health and stamina you have monitor and if you like to be clean shaven, you have to watch your beard too (shame that you can't fully grow it out))  And there's more I probably forgot about, but this game got me hooked. I don't personally like horror games, but this one I just loved. One of the many things I loved about this game is that everybody had CHARACTER. It actually felt like meeting a real person, nobody's persona is baseless and everybody has a story, a secret, a dream and reasons for being the way that they are.   Terrible game but it's 10/10 for me!  
4139	1	a	Deadly Premonition is one of the strangest games I have played. It has terrible graphics, a story largely ripped straight from Twin Peaks, combat that is so easy it feels tacked on, bad driving controls, and terrible sound design among other things. In the end though I enjoyed it enough to finish the game with all the side missions completed and I even got the 65th trading card. It isn't by any means a good game, but something about it just makes it fun. This is very much a video game equivalent of a cult film. Anyone who enjoys the sound of that should give the game a try.
4141	1	a	Before I begin, I owned this on Xbox and recently started playing through the PC version.  I'm not sure I can say Deadly Premonition is good, but at the same time it is. I've used 'disgustingly average' to describe it before. Yet, I can't recommend it enough. Its basically Twin Peaks the game, in a sense.   If you like horror, or action, or story, this is a game for you. The game has many flaws. The driving sucks, the combat could be a little better, the squirrels make MONKEY noises. But, those make Deadly Premonition what it is.   This game is basically the definition of 'So bad it's good'
4143	1	a	Weird but very enjoyable story.
4145	1	a	If you can get past the PS2 graphics/gameplay there is a great story line with amazing characters. One of the best games I've played in a while.
4147	1	a	8/10 Played this first on the Xbox. A ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game with a fantastic story. If you can suffer through the horrible driving an medieval graphics for a truly rewarding mystery this game is for you.
4149	1	a	Deadly Premonition is the vieo game verson of Twin Peaks but with a supernatual twist and a japanese charm. Recomended if you like small town murder mysteries with bizzar characters and if you like the odd obscure Japanese game.
4151	1	a	This game is amazing. One of the funniest games I've ever played, and one of the only few games to capture that B-grade movie feeling of low budget, roughness and unnintentional humour. If you can overlook bugs and technical flaws you are out for quite an experience.  Can't recommend it highly enough!
4153	1	a	What this game lacks in visuals Alan Wake has them, what Alan Wake lacks in ambition this game has it. This game is a problem, but a good one.
4155	1	a	'The Room' of video games. Close competition with Alan Wake for also being the 'Twin Peaks' of video games.
4157	1	a	This game. Holy ♥♥♥♥. It's just like one of my mystery Chinese visual novels, except in America.  i cant click the yes button enough
4159	1	a	This game is amazing. One of the funniest games I've ever played, and one of the only few games to capture that B-grade movie feeling of low budget, roughness and unnintentional humour. If you can overlook bugs and technical flaws you are out for quite an experience.  Can't recommend it highly enough!
4161	1	a	Gloriously terrible, I had a great deal of fun with this game due to the campy and strange humor that is thrown about in the game. I got hooked on it very early into the game but felt a little let down by the ending, this isn't a game for everyone and it's replay value is very minimal.
4163	1	a	is it a game or a film? stop talking about gameplay and enjoy the atmosphere.
4165	1	a	You play as an autistic detective in this game.
4167	1	a	Just got this title free with 10$ indiegala purchase and decided to install it. got constant crashes with the EXE. I managed to get it working by going into the games redist folder and running the PhysX_SystemSoftware exe in it and ran the vcredist_x86 exe. seems to work good so far. If this is helpful feel free to send me some game gifts? lol worth a shot. 
4169	1	a	What a port. Theres a german saying 'Verschlimmbessert' which unfortunately cant be translated. Disimprove?  Gave this another try since i finally got me an xbox controller for my pc (keyboard+mouse controls like ♥♥♥) and they switched the controls around and actually made em worse. Great.  Then the 'HD' treatment. Some assets (mainly UI) got retouched (looking worse but thats a matter of personal taste i guess) and slapped together with old stuff making for nice eye biting contrast. Some of the 3D Models for the inventory items got a shiny slime filter or something tossed onto them. The resolution is higher but the textures are the same resulting in highres blurryness. Amazing. The original wasnt a graphical marvel but at least consistent.   Additionally the game seems a litte too fast which actually managed to make me a little nauseous. Last game that did that was Starfox on SNES. Audio is still messed up. Nice shot.  The Thumbs up is for Deadly Premonition and that people who never ever plan on buying a Xbox360 ever ever (its cheap now and theres alot of other pretty good games...) have a chance of experiencing it - even in the warped form of this suboptimal port.
4171	1	a	it's something else...
4173	1	a	The coffee says: 'bring a raincoat'
4175	1	a	Nothing better than this, right Zach?
4177	1	a	This is a pretty neat game.
4179	1	a	Zach, have you heard of the 2010 video game Deadly Premonition, directed by Hidetaka Suehiro? It's about an FBI agent investigating a mysterious murder in a seemingly peaceful small town. On the surface it looks to be based on the 1990 television show Twin Peaks, but it really takes the idea in a new direction. It's a very unique experience!  I vividly recall the wonderfully awkward voice acting and sound design over all else. The song 'Life is Beautiful' holds a particularly special place in my heart. Combined with the dated-yet-endearing graphics the game oozes an inimitable charm. Though Deadly Premonition mainly involves driving around Greenvale to investigate the murder and interrogate suspects, there are 3rd-person shooting sections where you fight paranormal monsters! Such scary fun! The controls were a little tough to work with at times, but nothing unmanageable.   Even though the game crashed on me several times I always came back to learn more about the strange residents of Greenvale and the bizarre story. Thankfully there are fans that love the game so much that they created their own patches to fix some of the problems! I highly recommend you look into them, Zach.  What's that Zach? Coffee? What a fantastic idea!
4181	1	a	Without spoiling the game and giving away what makes this so special, I will simply say that Deadly Premonition is one of the most underrated and brilliant video games ever created. Full applause and credit to the one and only Swery65 for making a game that despite it's major shortcomings (controls, graphics, PC optimization) is the most engrossing and intelligent games out there. And again without spoiling anything, has the best twist in a story that proves just how important the video game medium is.  If you're even remotely interested in this game, just pick it up. Especially at such a cheap price ($2.49 as of this review), you'll be getting a game that you can sink hours into playing and days upon days discussing with your friends. Just be sure to look up some of the user made patches like DPFix to get the most out of the game.
4183	1	a	Amazing! Isnt it Zach?
4185	1	a	QTE's broke my controller, story broke my mind. 10/10
4187	1	a	Birds with chimp sound effects, magic seeds, helghast handicapps, turkey jam cereal sandwiches. 10/10!   One of my favourite games ever,just buy it if you can put up with the controls and the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ pc port (try get the director's cut on PS3 if you can)    Zach agrees!   (Ignore the hours of game time, I've spent over 80+ hours on PS3.. I bought it again on PC and just wanted to share my opinion with my fellow steamens.)
4189	1	a	thid is a awesome game great graphics great controls great dl models great animations best game ever
4191	1	a	QTE's broke my controller, story broke my mind. 10/10
4193	1	a	THANK YOU BASED DURANTE  http://blog.metaclassofnil.com/ 
4195	1	a	Let's get the biggest negatives out of the way. Buggy. Gameplay reminiscent of old resident evil games - may be good or bad depending on your perspective. Locked resolution (there's a mod), dated graphics (dem textures). If you don't enjoy hours of exploration, you will essentially need a guide to help you locate sidequests. Sidequests are repetitive.  The story is great and I personally think the main character in particular is excellent. There are a handful of sidequests that provide genuinely useful items for the effort you put in (wrench, radio, weather doll) and the rest are forgettable. Combat is decent. Aiming with the mouse is stiff, but aiming compensation makes it very easy to achieve headshots.  Over all, for the price I bought it at ($10 I think) I would recommend it, provided quite an entertaining experience. For $25, there are better things to spend money on.  
4197	1	a	Bad game: the game. A good game.
4199	1	a	Get ready for a blast from the past! Run this game in WIndows 98 compatability mode for the ultimate old school experience!!!
4201	1	a	Deadly Premonition achieved what many ♥♥♥♥♥♥ games can't do. To keep you seated no matter how abysmal it looks and plays. An absolute purchase to anyone with a guilty pleasure for weird games.
4203	1	a	This is, hands down, my favorite 360 game from 2010. It started development as a PS2 game, and still looks and plays pretty much like a PS2 game.   Unfortunately it also isn't the best port. It has controller support, but there are some weird issues with the triggers that gets kind of annoying. Also at times your framerate will drop to single digits and the only way to fix it is to restart your PC, so that's weird.  But basically it's a Japanese take on David Lynch's Twin Peaks, just put into a videogame. The characters are eccentric and endearing, and the mystery and presentation of the story is actually pretty engaging. The shooting and driving isn't so great, but the game has so much god damn heart it's hard to be upset at it.
4205	1	a	Fantastic. Buy it.
4207	1	a	Bad game: the game. A good game.
4209	1	a	Great interesting game, makes you want coffee an smokes
4211	1	a	One of my favorite games of all time. Terrible graphics, audio mixing and game play, but awesome characters, story and music.
4213	1	a	If you’re going to measure Deadly Premonition using traditional gaming yardsticks like graphical fidelity, gameplay challenge, and overall polish, then this Director’s Cut still comes up short of modern standards even with the fixes. Yet despite any obvious technical shortcomings, it succeeds on the strength of its story, its characters, and its countless WTF moments. It doesn’t feature enough new content to interest existing fans, but if you want to find out which side of the love-it-or-hate-it divide you're on, now’s the perfect time to play one of the most memorable and utterly insane survival-horror games ever made in its most accessible form.
4215	1	a	Deadly Premonition is an amazing experience! I encourage you to stop what it is you are doing and play this game.
4217	1	a	One of my favorite games of all time. Terrible graphics, audio mixing and game play, but awesome characters, story and music.

4221	1	a	Words cannot describe how good this game is zach.
4223	1	a	This game is a cult classic. Not sure how I never got into this game when it originally came out.
4225	1	a	Zach, I don't really see what most people are complaining about. It's a very surreal game with an interesting story and memorable characters. Wouldn't you agree? Gameplay mechanics are a bit clumsy, but that's our charm, Zach. I saw in the coffee that our Director's Cut would be significantly more enjoyable than the original, so, I guess all's well that ends well.
4227	1	a	Shot jim in the face  game crashed  11/10    SO I RECENTLY PLAYED THE 360 EDITION.  Loved the ♥♥♥♥ out of it serious 10/10.
4229	1	a	Zach, this game... it's amazing.
4231	1	a	time is a flat circle
4233	1	a	this game is biblical
4235	1	a	This game is almost broken on steam so if you decide to get it you will have to patch the hell out of it. To get this game to work you have to make it run in compatability mode for windows 98.  When you get this game to work though it looks like ♥♥♥♥ and plays like garbage. But this is the best awful game you will ever play. While the graphics and the gameplay are terrible the dialog and the story is great. The game has a large variety of weird and interesting characters which makes this game so unique. But I won't lie its tideous baring with the gameplay parts inbetween the dialog and other goodness. The driving is absolutely crazy but you have so many buttons for a bunch of functions on your car.  This has to be my favorite awful game and one of my favorite games.
4237	1	a	did you see that zach? clear as a crisp spring morning!  GOTYAY! IN the coffee!
4239	1	a	Best 14 min of my life.
4241	1	a	Don't buy this until they (if or when) fix being able to use a controller. Otherwise you're screwed, Zach.
4243	1	a	Playable?
4245	1	a	in my mind this game is a masterpiece, its like a drawing done by a 5 year old though, the execution is horrid but the idea behind it is amazing. firstly i dont know why it does it for me, this has ONLY happened to me, not even the dev knows why, but my cutscenes are really messed up and i will put a link so you can see.  https://www.dropbox.com/s/5wdfh902guxatyg/2014-04-07_00002.jpg?dl=0  - that is supposed to be the intro  https://www.dropbox.com/s/ugttu4sqy8ro2uv/2014-04-07_00003.jpg?dl=0  - thats supposed to be the main menu  now onto the pros: the game has a very interesting story. there is a lot to do has the classic intentional bad dialogue some rather strange humor a horror aspect in an open world  now the cons: this game is astonishingly buggy there are constant issues no matter what its controls are a bit wonky by default but can be changed no graphical options.  all in all if i myself could fix the cutscene issue this would be one of my favorite games even with its issues.
4247	1	a	Pros: Amazing game filled with comedic moments, fun driving mechanics, huge plot and a great mystery covering the entire game.   Cons: Controls are kinda clunky, no gamepad support (despite being a console game before ported), and resolution is locked at 720p. Graphical options are minimal if anything, and there appear to be a few more loading texture problems than in the PS3/XBOX360 version of this game.  All in all, despite the numerous technically problems, this game is well worth buying to enjoy the characters, story, and all around funny dialogue. Playing Deadly Premonition: The Director's Cut on the PS3 or XBOX360 is a better option, though. The only benefit of playing on PC is the return of Francis York Morgan's kill quotes, which were sadly missing from the console versions of Director's Cut.  9/10
4249	1	a	I am thinking that this game is pretty good.
4251	1	a	Good game, port needs some love if you want to play it.
4253	1	a	Not the best port, but it's absolutely one of the best games ever made. Feels like a long-lost Dreamcast game with absolutely incredible characters, story, and world-building. Worth playing on whatever platform you can.
4255	1	a	I've never had so much fun looking for squirrel keychains
4257	1	a	CAUTIOUS RECOMMENDATION: In its current state, I can't recommend DP to anyone but the old school PC gamers that don't mind getting their hands dirty with tweaks and fixes to keep it stable, let alone looking adequate. If you don't know what an .ini file is, stay away. Even then, a quality experience is far from assured.  Aside from the abundant technical problems, everything that could be called gameplay is clunky and monotonous. It's absent for most of the game, but the ending ramps it up a lot, which quickly feels like a chore to complete.  That said, the characters and story are worth the trouble for those with the requisite patience.
4259	1	a	A fun but insanly buggy title. I needed a guide to avoid all the game crashing bugs just to get through it. An odd personality and story drives this game. not for everyone, i recommed doing alittle research to see if it is your kind of game becuase you will need to put alot of effert in to avoid all the game crashing bugs.there might be some fan made patches and fixes out there but it is a bad port of a good game
4261	1	a	One of the most underrated games of history
4263	1	a	Most of my gameplay time is from redoing missions after I crash during cut scenes. It's almost as if the developers don't want me to play this game, Zach.
4265	1	a	It's buggy, and the zombies never make sense. The bad parts are... really bad. But the good parts are excellent. This is definitely one you want to pick up on sale. I'd recommend it at full price if the developers fixed the crashing, but let's face it, that's never going to happen.
4267	1	a	This game crashed on me multiple times and might as well wasted almost 10 hours of my gameplay time yet it was one of the most surreal and undescribable deep experience I ever had. To be honest, how broken it is just add it to its charm. Everytime my car went bonkers, I chuckle, restart and play through it all over again with a heartfelt 'oh, SWERY' moment.
4269	1	a	This game is a masterpiece. Honestly, in my book it wins best game of all time. The plot is just really awesome with twists and turns everywhere. The main character is hilarious. FK..in the coffee. I lost my ♥♥♥♥. If you want a really good storytelling single player experince, this game does the best job on it. However, it dwindles in the graphics aspect as the characters' audio isn't usually in sync with the character's lip when they are talking. But that's only a small minor problem. 
4271	1	a	Technical mess, story and characters pure genius.
4273	1	a	Good game I guess.
4275	1	a	You won't find a game quite like this anywhere else. I trudged through glitches, crashes, slow gameplay, more crashes, and more crashes, I came against many game-breaking issues that I barely scraped by, and one game-stopping conundrum at the very end. It was absolutely miserable...and I feel it was totally worth it.  Watch out if you don't have patience, spare time, or sense of humor or open-mindedness, The gameplay is slow, clunky, and often boring, but I was never bored. I was always excitedly wondering when the next part of the story was going to unfold. I'd perhaps groan when I knew a long filler part was starting, but going through it all I'd be thinking was 'I can't wait to see what happens in the next cutscene.' The characters and story are a grand slam, though it gets quite weird.  The soundtrack is stilted but majestically strange, and a perfect fit for the game.  Now, this game is often a rollercoaster ride between genius and complete cheeseball, but both ends of the spectrum are equally enjoyable. I love cheese, but I also felt legitimately touched during parts of this game. This is the type of game I never want to forget about, and probably won't.  Read non-spoiler reviews such as this one, and go with your gut. You'll probably know by then if this game is for you or not.
4277	1	a	Introduce Simulator 'FBI Special Agent: Francis York Morgan. Please, just call me York. It's what everyone calls me.' 10/10 would introduce myself again.
4279	1	a	Zach, could you recommend this?
4281	1	a	I got The Pickles. Rating: 10/10 - Would shoot Japanese ghost acrobats again
4283	1	a	I mean, to say this is basically  Twin Peaks: The Video Game  would not only be far from a unique observation, but also an incredibly surface level impression. Sure, much like  Twin Peaks , the goofy and awkward nature of the game only adds to the charm and does nothing to detract the effectiveness of the genuinely spooky elements. The thing about  Deadly Premonition  is that it is significantly darker and the awkward quirky-ness is also reflected into the graphics.   Still, I'm only, like, a chapter in and I know I'll be pouring way more hours into this than I probably should. The gameplay works sort of like  L.A. Noire . The game isn't as much about gameplay as it is about story. The combat isn't the most important part. The 'game' operates much more like an interactive film or television show ('Previously in the investigation' or something along those lines greets you after loading the game)  I suppose my only complaint is that some of the combat sequences seem out of place. The game shines its brightest in the script and characters so maybe the awkward combat mechanics just pale in comparison to the strange town of Greenvale.  Deadly Premonition  is probably one of my favorite games out there right now.
4285	1	a	I don't even know where to begin to describe this. This is probably the worst PC port in the history of ports (even worse than Dark Souls). It crashes constantly and has little glitches here and there. That's not even touching upon the absolutely horrendous combat and driving mechanics. But hell if this wasn't one of the most unique games I've ever played. And the story is one of the best I've ever had the pleasure of experiencing in a game, and for that alone I'd recommend this game over a hell of a lot of other titles. If it's on sale and you think you can stomach the little fixes and mods you'll need to actually run it, you might just love it. Otherwise, pick up the more stable PS3 or Xbox 360 versions.
4287	1	a	This is a good game and I want to finish it, but it crashes non-stop and I have no idea if it's ever going to be fixed or if it can be fixed. It's not the best game in the world, but I like it for it's story and unconventional gamplay.
4289	1	a	Introduce Simulator 'FBI Special Agent: Francis York Morgan. Please, just call me York. It's what everyone calls me.' 10/10 would introduce myself again.
4291	1	a	If you like campy movies and can get past the ps2 level graphics, Deadly Premonition has enough charm to keep you interested.
4293	1	a	Zach, could you recommend this?
4295	1	a	You won't find a game quite like this anywhere else. I trudged through glitches, crashes, slow gameplay, more crashes, and more crashes, I came against many game-breaking issues that I barely scraped by, and one game-stopping conundrum at the very end. It was absolutely miserable...and I feel it was totally worth it.  Watch out if you don't have patience, spare time, or sense of humor or open-mindedness, The gameplay is slow, clunky, and often boring, but I was never bored. I was always excitedly wondering when the next part of the story was going to unfold. I'd perhaps groan when I knew a long filler part was starting, but going through it all I'd be thinking was 'I can't wait to see what happens in the next cutscene.' The characters and story are a grand slam, though it gets quite weird.  The soundtrack is stilted but majestically strange, and a perfect fit for the game.  Now, this game is often a rollercoaster ride between genius and complete cheeseball, but both ends of the spectrum are equally enjoyable. I love cheese, but I also felt legitimately touched during parts of this game. This is the type of game I never want to forget about, and probably won't.  Read non-spoiler reviews such as this one, and go with your gut. You'll probably know by then if this game is for you or not.
4297	1	a	It's hard to objectively define Deadly Premonition. Perhaps it's a game so bad that it's somehow good. Perhaps it's a game intentionally bizarre and profound which is rough around the edges. Either way, it's not a forgettable game. That much is certain.  If I tried to review it on it's merits, the review would come across overly negative - the simple reason being it lacks them. Graphically it's poor. The soundtrack is forgettable. The gameplay is fairly boring. The controls are pretty bad. The constant onslaught of driving from place to place is dull. I could go on.  Despite this, the plot while hardly a masterpiece is just weird enough to keep you hooked. The protagonist is curiously unusual and his supporting cast unpredictable. All things considered, the game rarely goes where you expect it to, breaking most of it's tropes and keeping things fresh. It's suffice to say you'll keep playing just to see what crazy sh*t Deadly Premonition pulls next.  That is, if you can make it work. The PC port is nothing short of awful. In order to get a smooth experience, you'll need mods. At minimum, DPFix should be used. For a more solid, enjoyable experience, you can use some texture mods and SweetFX. The game is also full of bugs. I had to launch the game from the main exe as the launcher was incapable of doing so. I also had to patch the game to be large-address aware due to a fairly aggressive memory leak. I'd also strongly recommend a gamepad. Even after all this, the game still has a number of issues, but it's certainly playable.   So, do I recommend Deadly Premonition? I'd say yes, but barely. Pick it up cheap and hope to heck you can make it work. If so, you're in for a wild ride... for better or for worse.
4299	1	a	A weird but gripping third-person action thriller. If you're willing to overlook the technical flaws, awkward design and terrible port job, this is a true gem waiting to be found.
4301	1	a	CAUTIOUS RECOMMENDATION: In its current state, I can't recommend DP to anyone but the old school PC gamers that don't mind getting their hands dirty with tweaks and fixes to keep it stable, let alone looking adequate. If you don't know what an .ini file is, stay away. Even then, a quality experience is far from assured.  Aside from the abundant technical problems, everything that could be called gameplay is clunky and monotonous. It's absent for most of the game, but the ending ramps it up a lot, which quickly feels like a chore to complete.  That said, the characters and story are worth the trouble for those with the requisite patience.
4303	1	a	wow.....this game is the sh!t.
4305	1	a	Twin Peaks the game 10/10 pretty good. Port is garbage though; so are the quick time events.
4307	1	a	If you like campy movies and can get past the ps2 level graphics, Deadly Premonition has enough charm to keep you interested.
4309	1	a	Not the best port, but it's absolutely one of the best games ever made. Feels like a long-lost Dreamcast game with absolutely incredible characters, story, and world-building. Worth playing on whatever platform you can.
4311	1	a	Achievement is named Anna's Dairy 10/10
4313	1	a	wow.....this game is the sh!t.
4315	1	a	Deadly Premonition is a difficult thing to describe. Not at its core, but where it counts. Deadly Premonition is essentially Twin Peaks: the Video Game. So much so to the point where in its setting, characters, and major plot points are ripped almost directly from Twin Peaks. You are FBI special agent Francis York Morgan, tasked with finding the culprit behind the murder of a young woman in the small town of Greenvale that has some odd relation to a string of murders happening all across the country.   To preface this, I will simply say that Deadly Premonition: Directors Cut is one of the sloppiest, messy, and badly done PC ports for a game that is just not good. It has ransom crashes and even though people talk about CTD's (Crash To Desktop), the majority of crashes didn't even allow me to do that. The controls are clunky and the horror bits aren't as scary as they could be. Yet everything is done in such a way that it is just so absolutely amazing in every way. At its core, Deadly Premonition is one of my favorite games to play and is definitely one of my top ten games of all time. The weirdly written character dialogue backed up by one of the maybe 15 audio tracks that the game has to offer (but it's probably going to be Life Is Beautiful, who am I kidding) creates this setting that you just can't put down because you're so invested in the world it paints and the characters that accompany you on your investigation. Also it's just f****** weird in a great way.  TL;DR Even while the game is flawed in so many ways, all of its flaws contribute to an experience that every horror lover/movie lover/lover of David Lynch/person on this planet should partake in. The game is an absolutely amazing work of art that is only $2.50 during sales and totally worth the cash and the crashes.
4317	1	a	So far so good. I love the controls and Twin Peaksy feeling. Maybe filling the gas tank is not necessary.
4319	1	a	It's ♥♥♥♥ing horrible.
4321	1	a	OK, this game surely has its problem. It's a bad port, it needs some twisting around from keeping it from crashing, the driving mechanics are objectively bad, and the graphics is surely not top notch. But this game is a breath of fresh air from all the 'this game mechanics work, let's copy-paste it' games, it's extremely original and has a great late 90's early 2000 japanese vibe. It has one of the best horror plot ever seen in video game history, the character development is incredible and i was surely not expecting anything even close to this level. The english production is great, the voice acting is magnificent. The game is an open world investigation horror with paranormal elements, and it's unique in its genre. It's surely a game to try out, sadly the first 15 minutes of tutorial are not representative of the rest of the game and can turn a lot of people off before they get to the real beginning of the game. I really feel like recomending this to anyone who wants to try something different from the gaming standards we are accustomed today
4323	1	a	A solid game with some of the best characters in any game i've ever played and an amazing, gripping, hilarious, and interesting story that will suck you in and wash away the PS2-tier mistakes the game has.  It's one of my favourite games of all time, get it on xbox360 or ps3 though, the PC Port is quite terrible and will test your patience.   It's like a really good, cheesy movie in the shell of a mediocre game. It's hard to explain, you really need to play it. Do not pay full price for it on PC though.
4325	1	a	Imagine if Twin Peaks was made by a semi-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Japanese man named Swery and that's essentially what Deadly Premonition is.  I love it and you should too.

4329	1	a	The version of this classic is HORRIBLE on Steam. However, Over at Good Old Games it retains its charm and delight. Buy it there and not here!
4331	1	a	The port is really bad, but the story is actualy pretty good. There's a few mods that slightly fix the game and make it more playable, but expect crashes every 15-30mins.   I would recommend this game purely for the strange and interesting story.
4333	1	a	The best worst game ever
4335	1	a	Best plot ever. (Bugs too)
4337	1	a	I have a dream: to see Deadly Premonition remastered.
4339	1	a	If you love Twin Peaks and Resident Evil 4, give it a try. Its a unique experience you won't get anywhere else.  Fair warning, install the unofficial patches and be prepared for some bugs, the game is far from technically perfect.
4341	1	a	Not worth playing much of, but great when it's cheap, and one of the most ridiculous games you'll ever come across, go with the LP though.
4343	1	a	Zach, the coffee told me to nominate this game for the 2016 Steam Awards 'Game Within A Game' Award  Sinner's Sandwich/10 would premonition again hurhurhur
4345	1	a	un as administrator, Alongside windows 98 compatibility mode and restarting pc fixes all bugs. and yea its a good game only bad part is the lumbar mill at the start you get past that your golden.
4347	1	a	A technical mess of a game but if you just let it simply 'be' this is a game unlike most others out there. The game has a David Lynch inspired cooky story that goes in some surprising directions, the cast of characters are diverse and are fun to interact with.  A great game but also a terrible one. It's like a great B-Movie in that I can't recommend it to everyone but if you think you'll enjoy it you probably will... just give it a couple hours to sink in and come to the terms with the fact that the minute to minute gameplay is nothing to write home about!  8/10
4349	1	a	This game legitimately manages to be both the best and the worst experience I've had playing a game.  By default it's locked at 30 FPS and 720p, while crashing constantly. Installing a fix for this doesn't actually fix the framerate issue causing it to change periodically AND change the game speed with it, as well as cause it to crash MORE. It's a knock off of Twin Peaks despite SWERY claiming to have never heard of it It's never getting an actual sequel due to the fact that SWERY has stopped making games to be a buddhist monk (Look it up I'm not ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥tting you) The gameplay itself is unbearably boring  That said the wack-♥♥♥ story and crazy characters/writing have elevated it to being one of the most memorable and fun experience I've had in a long time.  It's like $2.50 on sale the fact that only 2 people I know have it (One of which I gave it to) is a shame on all of you.
4351	1	a	twin peaks: the videogame
4353	1	a	Just love it. Sure it´s 'terrible' as a game, but I can´t but say that it´s pure gold for anyone who loves Twin Peaks or something deeper than gameplay and visuals.
4355	1	a	I love this game but GOD DAMIT JUST KEEPS CRASHING D8
4357	1	a	I don't even know how to properly describe this game or how it found its way deep into the cuckles of my black heart but my god is it a tour de force of pure WTF. If you have a pension for the weird and don't mind a terrible port, buy this ♥♥♥♥!
4359	1	a	What a weird game.. Terrible PC port; keeps crashing, freezing, lagging with a GTX 1060. Also the gameplay, please, this is so BAD.. Probably the worst driving experience since a while. But.. BUT. This game is AMAZING, there is something so unique to it. A GTAxSilent HillxTwin Peaks cross over. How could it not be great ? Despite all its weaknesses, I spent an amazing moment with the inspector Morgan and I would definetely recommend it to anyone. You need to play it and to go through the first terrible crashes and weird 2-3 hours of gameplay adaptation.  Really really great story taking a twist on what seems a Twin Peaks copycat, but it's absolutely not. There is also a very interesting ending, and a truly beautiful analysis not so hard to understand on the player's take.
4361	1	a	Good game I guess.
4363	1	a	Man I Love Twin Peaks. DONT LOOK AT THE ACHIVMENTS HUGE SPOILERS FOR THE WHOLE GAME
4365	1	a	Yes, the art is meh. The controls are bad, but not unbearable. Yet the story is incredible.  The story alone makes the game worth it to play.
4367	1	a	A mix of horror, mystery, mind confusing, awkward humor, topped off with an entertaining plot/story. Perfect always, yes.
4369	1	a	If you can think critically a simple google search and 1 easy. step can have this game working normally, I had another malfunction halfway through and i simply did the step again and I finsihed the game the next day because the story is engaging, hilarious, and surprisingly dramatic. the shooting is alright its not the best. I reccmoned using a controller. I really enjoyed this game when it wasnt making me go from point A to point B. BUT THE POINT IS to have fun and be a detective there is 100 things you can do besides just follow the main story. I loved this game and I plan to replay.
4371	1	a	I love this game. The gameplay is clunky and not very intuitive and there's glitches galore but the story is so weird as is the character. I'm basically playing myself. So, yeah, I'm biased.
4373	1	a	One of my all time favorite games. You have to play it to believe it. It'll bring you tears and it'll make you laugh. It's truly a game worth playing.
4375	1	a	Bad PC port. Be prepared to waste an hour figuring out how to install fixes to get it to work at all. Almost unplayable in its normal state.   Once I got it running it had a really trippy japanese horror movie thing going on, but I didn't get very far cause I think it crashed.   
4377	1	a	An obscure game known for being the most polarizing horror game ever, Deadly Premonition delivers a memorable experience. Despite bargain bin graphics and gameplay, the cast of bizzare characters make up for it, alongside the strange story. The PC port is unfortunately terrible, providing no graphics options, locked 720p resolution, locked 30fps, (According to Framerate Police) potential degrade in performance over time, failing to start on Windows 8, and frequent crashing. A mod called dpfix by the same dude that made the beautiful dsfix for Dark Souls' infamous PC port fixes issues and gives graphics options to the player. Now play this and make a Sinners' Sandwich.
4379	1	a	Buying this game is a catch-22. If you buy it, SWERY is able to eat and make more awesome games, but you're also supporting the malpractice of horribly broken PC ports. If you don't buy it (or don't play it), the devs won't want to port to PC in the first place.  Then again, a few sales earned or lost 3 years after the original release isn't going to have much effect on the developers.  Mods can fix it, but they don't prevent the crashes that set you back 30 minutes
4381	1	a	Atrocious port for an unique and fantastic game. Worth it only if you buy it on sale.
4383	1	a	My name is Zach in real life....
4385	1	a	PC Port is pretty bad, but if you tweak it a bit by going to your Deadly Premonition files located in your Steam folder, right click DP.exe, properties, change the Compaitablity to 98/ME, then go to DPLauncher.exe, and change that to Run as Admin, then launch it through the DPLauncher, it should be fully functioning, aside from the lack of options. Great game. prone to crashes and occasional graphics ♥♥♥♥ ups
4387	1	a	Deadly Premonition is one of my favorite games of all time. That being said this game really isn't for everyone. Watch some gameplay or a review and you'll pretty much know if this game is for you. Twin Peaks style, Humorous, B-movie, clunky survival horror game. If any of those points intrigue you I highly recommend you check DP out.   I'm aware the PC version has glaring issues, but I highly suggest you get this masterpiece on sale and do some tweaking with DP fix. You can also tweak the colors to your liking if the blue tint of the Director's Cut doesn't fit your personal taste. The PC also comes with all the DLC that was available when the DC originally launched on PS3. All in all, when it comes down to it, you either LOVE DP or HATE it. I urge anyone to give it a try as it is a unique and wonderful experience.  Perhaps look into your coffee next time and see if you find your answer?
4389	1	a	It's a weird game. Play it only if you have the patience to absorb the bugs and a bad port. Aiming weapons is really limited. Driving is atrocious. I have an issue with side quests available during a particular weather. That doesn't make sense. But availability of side quests at certain timings in a day is realistic. But the game has a good story, keeps you guessing on who the killer is. All the characters are well written and there are many of them. Huge attention to detail.
4391	1	a	It's a pretty good game despite all the crashes. I'd say 8/10.
4393	1	a	twin peaks: the videogame
4395	1	a	★★★★☆ Wonderfully great game, once you get past the graphics and driving you will find yourself enjoying a totally different type of game than what is available out there, I didn't go into the game thinking i'd like it much , but damn i was proven wrong, as the game progresses it just gets better, so if your a fan of thriller/action/sandbox/murder-investigation you'll love this game, if not you could very possibly still be pleasantly surprised by this games story and gameplay style, so give it a try!
4397	1	a	Deadly Premonition is one of the weirdest games ever. To give you a good analogy. Imagine if David Lynch wrote a brilliant script and gave it to Tommy Wiseau or Ed Wood to direct, then you would have a movie that would resemble this game. If this sounds like the most awesome movie ever, then you will probably enjoy Deadly Premonition. Ed Wood movies may be terrible, but their entertaining as ****.   Deadly Premonition is the brainchild of Hidetaka 'SWERY' Suehiro. I've read some interviews featuring SWERY and decided that he is completely bat**** insane and yet a genius at the same. This game went through development hell for 6 years and was almost cancelled 4 times. It seems like nobody on the team really knew how to program well, and the game was perhaps too ambitious for it's own good. When the game came out it was a broken mess. The graphics would have been good on the Dreamcast, the controls are so bad it feels like it has to be intentional(seriously, the car controls are so bad you'll have to play it to believe it), the voice acting is usally passible but can be cringe-worthy at times, the animations on the characters are laugable, the repetive yet catchy musical scores come on at the worst possible times, and despite the terrible graphics the game has horrendous performance issues. Apparently SWERY was actually shocked when critics proceeded to rip the game apart.  Despite all the games shortcomings, there were some people who loved it. Some thought the technical issues only added 'so bad it's good' charm of the game. And of course, the plot and writing of this game is brilliant, if not completely insane. It was obviously heavily influenced by the David Lynch's Twin Peaks. Many of the characters, including the main one, are completely bonkers. The main character Francis York Morgan always introduces himself by saying 'I'm Francis York Morgan, but just call me York, that's what everyone always calls me.' He constantly talks to his imaginary friend Zach. He says not to ask him about Zach, that's a 'private matter.' He literally tells his fortune by looking at the milk swirls in his coffee. To give you an idea of how crazy the writing in this game is *tiny spoiler ahead*, there's one part where a guy in a wheelchair with a skull mask and a gask mask on, who talks by whispering rhyming sentences to a translator, orders a bizzare sandwich in a restaurant. This sandwhich happens to be white bread and turkey, with strawberry jam and cereal(which appears to be corn flakes) smeared on top. York comments that this is a sinner's sandwhich, a sandwhich ones makes to punish themselves for their sins. The guy in the wheelchair challenges York to try this sandwich. After York tries it he jumps out of his chair in surprise, saying it's delicious and orders one. The expression on the two women's faces next to him is one of the moments that makes this game a masterpiece. BTW, you need to actually try the sinner's sandwich. I used Publix Italian Bread, Smucker's strawberry jam, deli turkey meat, and cornflakes. Putting the jam and corn flakes on top is ludicrous, so I just flipped the bread over. Surprisingly, it's delicous. I even made a second one after finishing the first one. SWERY says one of his starving college student friends actually made this, because he didn't have any money and those were the only ingredients he had. Too be honest, Americans put cranberry sauce and potato chips on sandwiches, so it's not too much of a stretch.  Slowly, but surely, just like the game NiER, Deadly Premonition gained gained a cult following. It did so for it's amazing writing and 'so bad it's good' gameplay. If you get this game, be aware that it may not even run properly and you might have to finish it by watching a let's play on youTube. SWERY actually apologized for this horrible port. However, there are a ton of fan patches out there to fix the problems. SWERY was flattered that the game had so much support that people would go to these lengths to make it playable. He said he wished he could hire some of the people who fixed his game. It might remind people of another cult game that was broken on release and had to be fixed by fan patches, Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines. That also featured terrible gameplay, but a brilliant plot.  Definitely give this game a chance if you're a fan of cult classics. At least watch a let's play on youTube to experience the plot and bizarre characters. SWERY has also created a new game, D4, which is a lot less broken and features characters that are even more insane. Sadly, SWERY's games have failed to make any money(he released D4 on the Xbone and not the PS4 I mean, come on, the only thing Xboners play is Call of Duty), and he has taken some time off to recover from an illness but insists he'll be back. We can only hope. This guy is up there with Eric Wolpaw(Portal, Psychonauts, and Old Man Murray) as one of the industry's best writers, and it would be a shame to lose him.
4399	1	a	I am thinking that this game is pretty good.
4401	1	a	I temporarily stopped playing this game to watch the movies York was talking about. Thanks, Zach!
4403	1	a	It's alright.
4405	1	a	Here's what I recommend:  1. Buy the game; support the developer 2. Don't play it 3. Watch all the cutscenes on Youtube  While there's approximately 6 hours of cutscenes, you'll find this to be much more enjoyable. The game portion of it isn't that bad, but you're just playing it to see what happens next.   Or you could just watch Twin Peaks (Oh damn, betcha never heard that one before).  This gentleman/woman took the time to piece together everything. Youtube link:         YouTube™ Video:  Deadly Premonition: Director's Cut - The Movie / All Cutscenes in 1080p [1/3]&nbsp;
4407	1	a	I don't even know where to begin to describe this. This is probably the worst PC port in the history of ports (even worse than Dark Souls). It crashes constantly and has little glitches here and there. That's not even touching upon the absolutely horrendous combat and driving mechanics. But hell if this wasn't one of the most unique games I've ever played. And the story is one of the best I've ever had the pleasure of experiencing in a game, and for that alone I'd recommend this game over a hell of a lot of other titles. If it's on sale and you think you can stomach the little fixes and mods you'll need to actually run it, you might just love it. Otherwise, pick up the more stable PS3 or Xbox 360 versions.
4409	1	a	I usually don't do this, but play this ♥♥♥♥ing game.  On a console.  The PC port is almost unplayable, but pick it up if you don't have a console.
4411	1	a	The game is a pretty good game. Its flawed but a lot of fun. Its especially more fun when you're a fan of Twin Peaks and you can see the inspiration from it. It just added to the game for me. But anyways yeah, the game is pretty fun. Too bad the PC port is garbage 8(
4413	1	a	If you can you should just go ahead and play the original or the PS3 version of this excellent terrible game, otherwise prepare to soldier through a lot of freezes and crashes, I did, but it took all my determination and autism to do it.   I'm proud of myself.
4415	1	a	The best worst game ever
4417	1	a	Drug Addict Developers Award. Now. To this game. It deserves it.
4419	1	a	This game is just so terrable its amazing!   It has a uniq story line and good characters! AND YOU CAN GET TOMS BISCUTS!
4421	1	a	When I first played this game I was blown away, not by it's graphics or it's gameplay but how strange everything was. All of the characters are memorable and 90% of the dialogue will have you saying 'what the ♥♥♥♥?' but it's got tons of charm. I can't recommend this game to just anyone though because it takes effort to look past it's shortcomings and really appreciate what it offers.  Did that sum it up pretty well Zach?
4423	1	a	Even though some foibles and abject crashes occur throughout each playthrough, I still highly regard this as an all time personal favorite of mine. It is hard to pinpoint exactly what it is that makes me adore this game so much. Maybe it is the idiosyncratic nature of each character, it might be the alluring soundtrack accompanying the game or it could also be due to all the different anecdotes spread out in the quirky town of Greenvale. It's far from being a perfect game but what it delivers is a memorable taste in your mouth.
4425	1	a	A technical cluster♥♥♥♥ hiding probably the most unusual and entertaining Twin Peaks fan game i've ever played.
4427	1	a	This game is just so terrable its amazing!   It has a uniq story line and good characters! AND YOU CAN GET TOMS BISCUTS!
4429	1	a	It's pretty much Twin Peaks: the game. Need I say more?
4431	1	a	F K in the coffee.
4433	1	a	If you're like me, you'll walk into this game blind. You'll have to fight with technical issues and endure some unpolished gameplay. If you're like me, you'll find yourself loving the characters so much that whatever issues the game has takes a back seat to the experience and you'll want to know what happens next.
4435	1	a	I do love this game, the story is very engaging. I love the characters and they are also engaging to the point I actually remember even the not very important ones. Gameplay is more old school horror kinda like RE, It is rare that I love horror games to where u always have a time limit. But I also understand why and they do give u enough time to do things. For it's time even the graphics were pretty I was amazed. Now for some of the Negitives was... I kept playing with my controller,And some times during QTE like running my controller wouldn't work at all. I tried to get the patch but the site didn't seem like it was there any more. And some glitches in the game were terrible like whe I had to follow someone, And she disappered off the screen and I failed the mission cause of it. Or I would go in a room and it would be completely black and I would fail the mission cause I fell through the world. Quite a few times I had to completely restart a mission cause of it. Or I would have to close the game because my game slowed to a crawl and if I didn't then I couldn't shoot anything fast enough or the QTE would be terrible. O ther than that I do recommend giving this a game a try especially if u are big on old school horror.

4443	1	a	One of my all time favorite games. You have to play it to believe it. It'll bring you tears and it'll make you laugh. It's truly a game worth playing.
4445	1	a	I can't recommend this game enough! This is above all my favorite story ever. It's the cheezyest most hilarious best worst thing ever made!
4447	1	a	I don't even know how to properly describe this game or how it found its way deep into the cuckles of my black heart but my god is it a tour de force of pure WTF. If you have a pension for the weird and don't mind a terrible port, buy this ♥♥♥♥!
4449	1	a	Buying this game is a catch-22. If you buy it, SWERY is able to eat and make more awesome games, but you're also supporting the malpractice of horribly broken PC ports. If you don't buy it (or don't play it), the devs won't want to port to PC in the first place.  Then again, a few sales earned or lost 3 years after the original release isn't going to have much effect on the developers.  Mods can fix it, but they don't prevent the crashes that set you back 30 minutes
4451	1	a	If you can you should just go ahead and play the original or the PS3 version of this excellent terrible game, otherwise prepare to soldier through a lot of freezes and crashes, I did, but it took all my determination and autism to do it.   I'm proud of myself.
4453	1	a	Best worst game.  Like a Twin Peaks video game made by the characters of Twin Peaks.
4455	1	a	the best game ever created
4457	1	a	This game is the embodiment of so bad its good gaming. the game play, the characters, the visuals, and the controls are a train wreck in the most beautiful way. (insert meaningless number score here).
4459	1	a	Zach, the coffee told me to nominate this game for the 2016 Steam Awards 'Game Within A Game' Award  Sinner's Sandwich/10 would premonition again hurhurhur
4461	1	a	This could be the best, worst game you'll ever play. I'd say a controller is required, instead of recommended, and look around for durante's fix, it's not a great port. From the moment you meet York and Zach, to the credits, this game is a roller coaster.  P.S. don't skip on the sidequests, they unlock things such as fast travel
4463	1	a	One of the best games ever made. It will give you the feels.
4465	1	a	Still the best game ever.
4467	1	a	The best worst game.
4469	1	a	F K in the coffee.
4471	1	a	Deadly Premonition is one of those games that defies description. I could write pages and pages and it would still not capture the experience that is playing this game. Just playing this game is a labor of love. There will be times when you hate yourself for deciding to play it (usually after it crashes and you realize you haven't saved in forever). There will be times when the wonky game mechanics will frustrate you to no end. Even before you play the game you will likely already regret buying it when you can't get it to work properly and have to comb through forums to find the fix to your specific problem. However, if you can push through the many absurd flaws that this game has you will be rewarded with a truly unique experience. It is certainly not something that everyone will enjoy, but I think that it is worth giving it a shot.  Likes: Unique experience, funny and fairly decent story and dialogue, good soundtrack, very ambitious in scope  Dislikes: This game has so many issues I couldn't even list them all, game mechanics are often executed poorly, fairly dated visuals, Can be repetetive if you only do main story  Feeling a strong 8 to a light 9
4473	1	a	the best game ever created
4475	1	a	Best worst game.  Like a Twin Peaks video game made by the characters of Twin Peaks.
4477	1	a	☛ Poor graphics ☛ Poor sounds ☛ Poor optimisation  ✌ The best game I've ever played ☕
4479	1	a	Game is clunky and poorly balanced, it looks like a late PS2 game, and it's it's as scary as moldy bread, but it's got a quirky sense of humor, characters that are well written and easy to get attached to, and a fun plot. It's also got a lot of collectible content and events you may need multiple playthroughs to obtain. Whether that's a good or bad thing is up to how much you love the game.
4481	1	a	An ugly, clunky mess of a game and a charming, witty, compelling adventure full of character. Deadly Premonition is weird and brilliant, sometimes buggy and tedious, yet inexplicably fun and unique. You can grab it for a very low price during sales, and it's my advice that you do because this is one of those experiences everyone has to go through.
4483	1	a	10/10 when you get it (sort of) working!
4485	1	a	There is so much to love here, the technical performance is not one of them (crashy) but hell it's worth it just for the whackiness, it's all the things you love about Japanese games turned up to 11. Cannot recommend it enough. bit of a tip, this game seemed to work better streamed than native, lol. And I challenge anyone who plays this to not whistle the them tune at least once a month.
4487	1	a	Knytt Underground is a 2D platform game of exploration with a quirky story. You play as Mi Sprocket who is a mute sprite. She is chosen to go on a quest (because her brother freaked out or something) to ring the six bells in order to prevent the world from being destroyed. Along the way she picks up two pixies who are her voice. Dora and Cilia couldn't be more polar opposite. One is kind and considerate. The other is brazen and brash.  The first two 'Chapters' of the game are a kind of tutorial. The first shows you Mi. She can run and jump and climb. She also picks up colored lights and can activate them for a one time special power.   The second introduces you to Bob. Bob is a ball, and can bounce. Pretty high. He also can create a static field around him that will pull him to special robots to allow him to play Tarzan the ball.  This will take about 90 minutes. Then you get to meat of the game...Chapter three. The map in Chapter three is a rectangle 30 by 48 (1440) screens. Plus several secret areas not on the map including a small inverted world and you have a huge world to explore.   There are side quests to complete and some symbols hidden in what seem to be extremely inaccessible areas. There are other sprites and pixies around the world that tell a quirky story about some sprite 'religions' having to do with technology.   The environments are unique. The different areas of the underground each come with different theme music. The part I liked best was trying to get items that seemed to be inaccessible. Many times you look at a screen and say 'No way' can that item be picked up. Then you go through the game and learn some tricks that will allow you pick them up. The mapping system does a good job marking these items (i) as well as quests (Q) on your map.  There have been many discussions around the internet regarding the controls for this game. Personally, I didn't find them to be an issue. I have been playing games with a keyboard for a very long time. Arrows to move, 'A' to use the special power, and 'S' to switch between states. The only issues that I had were on some of the timing puzzles and pressing the wrong button (A instead of S). I thought keyboard controls worked well with the game.  I would say to try the demo, but this only lets you play through the first chapter. While this will give you some feel for the game, the real meat and potatoes is in the third chapter. All I can say is I had a lot of fun exploring this game and having the story unfold.
4489	1	a	I can't believe how much fun I've had playing this title. There so much to explore, and so many secrets to find, it's unbelievable. The story might seem a bit strange to begin with, but while you explore the giant world you'll find various pieces of lore that helps with the bigger picture.  The game builds around a very simple puzzle mechanic: you can switch between a girl that can jump and climb, and a ball that can bounce higher and move faster. This works very well, and you'll meet some smart puzzles throughout the game where this comes in good use.  Even the art style is beautiful. Almost every single room has some uniqueness to it, and there's so many crazy creatures (knytts) you'll meet. Also, the music is very fitting.  I can only give this game a high recommendation.
4491	1	a	Knytt Underground gets the my highest personal reccommendation. I've Put almost 100 hours into the PSN and DRM-Free releases, and I know I'll be playing through a fifth time with the Steam release. The reason I can return to this game so frequently without getting bored is the world. It's the biggest game of its kind, and every single area has recieved a genuinely impressive amount of care. The story might seem inconsequential at first, but it explores some very sensitive topics with sincerity and handles its subject matter well. After you've finished the story, there's piles of ultra-challenging bonus areas and secrets to explore, too. The whole package is finished off with one of the best soundtracks in video game history, period. You can find it free on the developer's website, and I suggest you do. It's five and a half hours of outright brilliance. If exploring is your cup of tea, you should've picked it up when it first released last year.  Just a side note. It might not seem like it, but the game really does deserve that M rating. It has some serious subject matter in it that I wouldn't reccommend for kids (or for that matter, some adults).
4493	1	a	This game is very immersive. It's a world that I love to explore, and it feels very fun to explore too. This unqiue ambient relaxation between the art and the gameplay fit so well in something beautiful that I really have never seen so well done. Definitely a game to pick up. It's a very cheap price and I can definitely see myself playing this game for hours and hours and hours. Something I cannot find the words to explain, only the words to implore you to take a step into. I guarantee you will enjoy the experience.  Edit: Just noticed my hours played count is bugged. I've played through the whole thing - definitely took more than three hours, haha. Sorry about that.
4495	1	a	Nifflas very well could very well title this 'Yet Another Knytt Game' and I would have still bought it and would have still loved it. The game is comprised of Three chapters, the first two are 30-45 minutes each and will leave you worried the game is going to be 2 hours long. Fear not. Chapter Three offers the vast Kyntt exploration we know and love.  That is to say, Kyntt is a Metroidvania exploration game without the normal character progression you'd normally see holding you back. Instead there are a number of clever puzzles that are challenging but shouldn't leave you frustrated (in my experience so far at least). Instead the game reigns you in through, first and foremost, a vast world that forces you to explore your local area or you'll miss much of the beauty of the game, but at the same time makes it extremely clear that you've reached a deadend on the map so you're not left wondering if you can make a jump or not.   The second way it gives you a sense of progression comes by letting you try things. In some instances it explicitly warns you not to until you know more about this or that and if you ignore the warning chances are you're going to fail unless you already know what you're doing. It's a nice way of developing the story and mechanics for first time players without forcing repeat players through lengthy tutorials.  That's the kind of game creator Nifflas is. ♥♥♥♥ing amazing.  (Also, he's make a lot of other games with Knytt and Ball. Go play them. They're free.)
4497	1	a	This game succeeds in just about every way that a video game can. The puzzles are clever, the writing is brilliant, the the art is beyond breathtaking, and it all comes together to create something uniquely sublime. There is nothing quite like Knytt Underground, and I have a feeling there never will be.
4499	1	a	It's a bit like the game 'Botanicula' crossed with the game 'VVVVVV'. The first and second chapter aren't very long, but the third chapter has a very large map with a lot of background variety from area to area. I find it a very pleasant and soothing, sometimes funny game and to me it will always be a gem.
4501	1	a	Let me say this right away, I've not finished Knytt Underground nor do I plan to. Yet, I can safely say it's an amazing platformer and very well put together. I got until the last chapter by myself but after exploring most of the rooms I just couldn't bother to exploring every single one of them so I just went on Youtube and saw a walkthrough from where I was until the end and I loved it. While at first glance Knytt Underground may look like just another puzzle platformer amongst the many others that have came out on recent years, it's not. Knytt Underground tells a story, a very strange story that will only make sense by the end of the game. The story is told in a hidden way, just like an hidden message and there are places online where you can see peoples explanations of the story in case that's the only thing that interests you. Besides that, Knytt Underground is a very well made platformer, very fluid, responsive controls, possibly Super Meat Boy level of controls along with some minor teleport and flying mechanics. The soundtrack on this game is nothing short of amazing, very calm and charming along with the brilliant visuals that decorate the background and they vary alot from level to level. Overall, it's pretty safe to say that you can't go wrong with Knytt Underground, either if you're looking for a great platformer or for a great story, it is an incredibly well made game.
4503	1	a	- If you want to play a game that has a story to tell even though its optional, this is a game you want. - If you want to puzzle in a game in ways of getting from A to B, this is a game you want. - If you do not want to be bound by a linear gameplay, but rather do it the way you want, this is definitely a game you want. - If you want to play a game with replay value, the secrets in this game that are so many of them will ensure that. - If you want to play a platform game, this is a game you want. - If you like sarcasm form of humor, this is definitely a game you want. - If you enjoyed Within a Deep Forest and Knytt, this is a game you'll regret missing if you don't get it. - If you want to have a challenge in a game, this is a game you want. - If you don't like to be challenged in game, this is still a game you want, because you have the choice to avoid challenges. - If you are bored, this is a game you want. - If you have little time, this actually may not be a game you want because it is addictive. - If you hate it when a game sets you back when you die, this is a game you want.

4505	1	a	  TL;DR  - Do you like platformers? If so, buy this game. If not, buy this game anyways.
4507	1	a	If you've never played a Knytt game before, stop reading right now,  head over here  [nifflas.ni2.se] , and play Knytt and/or Knytt Stories for free. These games, created by a lone developer called Nifflas (also of NightSky and Saira fame), are some of the finest exploration-based platformers I've ever had the pleasure of playing. Knytt Underground is the most recent in the series, and while it might be the most ambitious, it makes some unexpected departures from the previous games.  You know you're in for something special when the game loads straight to a tutorial that turns out to be the main menu. There are three chapters in Knytt Underground, though the first two are essentially introductions to the massive third. You play both as Mi Sprocket, a mute little sprite, and Bob, a sentient bouncing ball from another early Nifflas game, Within a Deep Forest. Together they embark on a grand journey through the underground of a post-apocalyptic Earth far more mysterious and colorful than anything you've seen in Fallout. The surfaces you traverse are all shown in silhouette but the backgrounds are vibrant, animated collages of Photoshopped worlds. Every alien landscape you can imagine is represented here, with enormous gardens, crystal caves, blasted deserts, crumbling temples, ominous graveyards, and sinister machinery among them.  While you have a massive, massive map to explore, don't confuse this with a metroidvania. Mi and Bob never gain new abilities to navigate with, though their own basic skills provide a wealth of options. Mi can climb walls and Bob can bounce, and switching freely between the two allow you to pull of some surprising maneuvers. There are also colored seeds that grant Mi a one-time power like flying in a straight line, and robots that Bob can tether to. Creative use of these resources can indeed get you anywhere you need to go, no matter how impossible the passage seems. The result is almost like a puzzle game, where you'll find rooms that look like they need special powers to traverse, but eventually you'll have that eureka moment and puzzle it out yourself.  You'll have tons of items to find as well, and the denizens of the underground give quests that'll reward you with what you need or point you in the right direction. These items are used to pass the gates barring your ultimate objective, but there's some welcome flexibility to the collecting. One gate might require 5 items out of a possible set of 8, and if you find some of the game's well-hidden coins you can substitute them as well. This means you'll never get stuck on a particular puzzle for a single item, and exploration will always reward you with something you can use.  Previous Knytt games had stark pixel graphics and a distinct sense of isolation to them. Nifflas often populates his strange and alien worlds with little harmless critters but not sentient creatures, usually leaving you alone to explore the vast spaces in solitude. Knytt Underground is a sharp departure here, adding not only loads of characters to talk and deal with, but also giving them incredibly unexpected personalities. Everyone speaks with modern sensibilities, almost like irreverent sitcom characters. They'll call out their own foibles and contrivances, and denigrate a lot of your quests as pointless busywork. One of your two pixie companions is also as foul-mouthed as you can imagine, frequently telling people to go ♥♥♥♥ themselves and eat glass and such. It's such a weird departure in tone from the previous games, even moreso in how their hideous, blobby portraits clash with the clean lines of the rest of the game.  The NPCs are the only major knock against an otherwise atmospheric experience, and to be fair, seeing their character arcs through redeems the worst offenders. Even on top of the 10+ hours of exploration the game offers, there are a host of secrets to find. Some are tied up in the game's unique and challenging fast travel system which I won't spoil, but be aware there's no easy teleporting around the enormous map until you master it. Just like the rest of the game, though, it's worth putting the time into to experience. Knytt Underground is a marvelous journey from start to finish, one that's easy to immerse in and immensely rewarding to play.
4509	1	a	Firstly, I must admit that I am a huge fan of Nifflas' (the game's developer) work. Ever since I first played Within A Deep Forest I knew I wanted to play more of his games. Getting this one on Steam was great and he's still doing great games. All the mechanics are solid and really fit well in the game. Controls are surprisingly working exactly like you'd think and the physics are something I really love. The story is rather confusing but I didn't really mind that. The characters are really well done, even though I'm sure some people will definitely disagree with me. All in all, it was a great experience and I recommend it if these kinds of games interest you.
4511	1	a	I so very much love this game. I've spent most of my day today playing it because it's just that engaging. It's a beautiful combination of exploration-based gameplay and 2D platforming. The game map is huuuuuge. And that could be a bad thing, but exploring it is a joy because of the diverse atmospheres and all the little bits of story scattered throughout. I filled out the map simply because it was fun to explore. There's hundreds of puzzles and plenty of hidden objects to find, and the map's nice enough to mark mostly everything for you. The only thing you have to find on your own are the hidden passages (which on a few occasions are really difficult to find and figuring out how to reach hidden rooms is quite the epiphany~) That's not to say the game is easy, though. There's plenty of difficult action sequences, and if you plan to get all the achievements you really need to master the controls and the game's physics, because it can be HARD. Not quite as difficult as some precision platformers get, but you can spend a lot of time on the same screen or two. I really can't properly describe how this game pulls you in. Personally, I'd sit down, boot it up, and start filling in more of the map, only to discover that two or more hours had vanished while I was making progress. It's a game that demands your attention and doesn't easily let it go. And I'm quite glad I played it~
4513	1	a	I haven't felt this about a game in some time. Very charming, I simply love all the little locations and pieces of dialouge. Simply getting around the world is fun, and I believe exploring the fairly large map to be another brilliant part of Knytt Underground. I want more games to be so fundementally fun and intresting. Highly reccomended.
4515	1	a	A platformer-puzzle game with a huge map, and I mean really REALLY HUGE. I'm almost 20 hours into the game and I explored like 60% of the map. Take Metroid with less pew pew and mix it with dozens of secret rooms. Add funny dialog (beware adult language) puzzles (some of them are challenging but not infuriating) and nature backgrounds. Don't let the 1st (here you learn the game basic mechanics) and 2nd (here you learn how to play as a ball, another form you can transform into) missions fool you. They're short and easy, but they're just a training for the extremely long 3rd mission. The downside for me is the music. I don't mind relaxing music, in fact I like it. But this game is just ambiental noises: birds chirping, wind blowing, etc. It's calm but sometimes you'd prefer more elaborated tunes.
4517	1	a	Knytt Underground is a more evolved amped up edition of the classic Knytt gameplay. Playing the original Knytt felt like a sweet regular nintendo game with way better sound.  Knytt Underground feels like if the franchise just came to Super Nintendo as it significantly sets the bar higher than the previous game. Everything is improved and worth paying for.   Years ago, I played Knytt which was a free platformer game from some guy i never heard of. He or someone provided a level editor and pretty soon, I was playing dozens and dozens of fan mods (essentially the same game concept but with different locations, music, puzzles and enemies and some pretty infuriating gameplay mechanics)  What drew me into Knytt and kept me coming back was the great feeling of size and scope. The sound design was always brilliant. Wonderful ambient music (which is some of my favorite kind of music) no voice acting (good thing) , satisfying sounds of scuttling along, jumping, crawling up walls, splashing into water, ect. You feel like a little beetle bug just trying to get somewhere.   Generally Knytt games revolved around a very bare bones narrative story, just simply enforcing the idea you had to get somewhere. Sometimes the motive was silly, sometimes it was supposed to be serious.   Depending on which map you got, you might have a giant maze world full of keys you have to collect to advance, like a typical metroidvania, and/or was simply set up in a way that required abilities to be found and progress. Sometimes it was both.  never did the game hold your hand. It generally pointed you to go 'left' and that's all the instructions you usually got. Figure it out on your own.   Knytt Underground is all of this, still. But its better. the new gameplay mechanics immediately feel welcome and a great add on to an already winning formula !   The only criticism I have for Knytt Underground is the art style of the 'sprites' (as in, the characters who identify as sprites, little magical beings). I don't mean the pixelated sprite that represents a game character in a 2D pixelated game. In action, the sprites look fantastic and I wouldn't change a thing. however, the points where the game pauses for dialog with a NPC are where I have issues.   The original Knytt, if I recall correctly, didn't do this. Character's 1 line or so of dialog would simply display as you walked near them and the dialog disappeared when you got a certain distance away.   Now the dialog is initiated by pressing a button, which is fine ! No problem with this. The problem is the hideous enlarged profile portrait of a sprite when you are talking to it (or when your sprite character is talking). Suddenly all that beautiful art style you were enjoying gets shattered by the worst looking MS PAINT quality blotches of color I've ever seen in a game. (ok, i've probably seen worse but the point is these are completely out of place). I wish they either re-did these to look smaller (as the larger presentation is what reveals how crappy they look) or simply use their head instead of the whole body. Because they simply look awful. I do not like.   Other than that, I pretty much covered it all ! Watch some gameplay vids of the original Knytt to see what i'm talking about.  A great experience. I recommend.
4519	1	a	First of all, although I haven't played much of this on PC I have completed the game on Vita and from what brief playtime I had on the PC version there doesn't seem to be any differences. One thing I would recommend is playing in windowed mode as the graphics appear stretched in fullscreen.  Knytt Underground is one of my favourite games that I have played this year, totally unexpectedly. I came into this thinking I'd mess around on it for half an hour but what I found is one of the most deep and immensely enjoyable puzzle exploration 'complete the map' games I have ever played. I can't really explain it, but I found the mechanics really fun and easy to get the hang of yet difficult to master and the game has an unexplainable charm to it that I haven't found in many other games this year. Initially in the first two chapters the game seems small and limited, but this is simply a tutorial or prologue if you will to the massive chapter 3 which is when the whole game's map opens up. It's addictive to try and discover and explore each of the grids in the game's map system and to discover the secret and story behind each area. Many areas involve puzzles which make use of enemies and hazards and the game's climbing and jumping mechanics to solve, and the ability to *SPOILER* transform into a ball and use momentum to bounce and reach previously unreachable areas *SPOILER* which is fun in itself.  It's one of the games that looks simple and low-budget and to an extent it is, but it also has this deceptively deep story and an incredible atmosphere and soundtrack which to me at least is one of the hardest but most important elements of a game to get right.   To say go play this game and see for yourself isn't very helpful I know, but it really is something that you need to play to understand the points I'm making. If you're feeling hesitant, buy it on sale, but keep it on your wishlist because this is a game that you need to play.
4521	1	a	If you've ever played or enjoyed any of Nifflas's other games, you will probably both enjoy and feel familiar in this one. (And if you haven't, Within A Deep Forest and Knytt Stories are both freeware, so go play them). And I don't just say that because your characters control like the two from those games. However, this is not just 'more of the same', and does see him treading new ground.  Gameplay is exploration heavy and very atmospheric. Many areas have puzzles or hazards like enemies and lava, and in some cases (mostly in secret levels) those can be quite difficult. However, those are not the focus of the game, and many other areas there's only platforming or even no obstacles at all. You don't gain permanent powerups, but areas may have objects that give you temporary abilities. Emphasis is on the scenary and atmosphere instead, and on the story.  Yes, the story. And that's the new ground: The story here is very good. You spend most of the game with two companions with layered personalities and backstories, and can choose which one of them will talk for you with most NPCs. As you explore you'll uncover more of their backstory along with the mute protagonist's. The story defies a lot of genre conventions; quests don't always end in a way the characters find satisfying (though they usually do), people are occasionally unable or unwilling to compensate you, and ultimately a lot of doubt is cast on the claim that your quest to 'save the world' is actually doing anything. Combined with the unusual backstories and themes, it is a pretty unique experience.  The game becomes extremely nonlinear once you beat the introductory chapters. You can explore in any direction as far as you want, and the world is huge, but if you want you can 'beat' the game before seeing huge portions of it. There's also tons of secret rooms and levels, both within the game world and accessible from exploring the menu/hub world.  Overall, I'd highly recommend trying this game. Just don't expect any aspect of it to be fast paced.
4523	1	a	This game is a knyttatrohpic! It brings the new knytt game with one of his old games (Within a Deep Forest) It gives ambience, chills, and some times sadness. BUT IT IS A AWESOME GAME! I GIVE IT A INFITINY/10 AND INFITNE STARS!
4525	1	a	 Tldr: One of the best games I played of all time.  This game is really well made, you have awesome character development, an extremly fitting art style and background music which makes you feel comfortable and the map of Knytt Underground is  huge  and got  tons  of secrets. The gameplay mechanic is innovative and after you got a hang of the controls you can involve your surroundings in your gameplay. Completing the main story of the game will take you about 6 hours, but you really want to miss out all the sidequests, additional characters, secret challenges, several ending and and and.  If you want to have an atmospheric and relaxing experience, try out Knytt, you will not regret it.
4527	1	a	I have been a fan of Nicklas's games since I first played 'Within A Deep Forest' so many years ago. While most of his games tend to have a similar gameplay style, they are always enjoyable and have an amazing aesthetic.  Knytt Underground is one part 'Within A Deep Forest', one part 'Saira', and one part 'Knytt'. The simple platforming and exploration gameplay of Knytt is merged with the harder, physics-based platforming from WADF and is then set in a world using surreal photo-realistic environments akin to Saira.  This all produces a massive, metroid-vania-like, ambient, exploration platformer that is easy to get lost in. It is not afraid to crank up the difficulty in a few areas to keep you on your toes, but the whole map is incredibly non-linear so you are rarely forced to go through a section when you first come to it. This game is essentially one huge scavenger hunt, but it never feels like a chore, even when you are backtracking through areas you have already been to. There are quite a lot of secrets as well, many of which provide the hardest sections of the game and are completely optional.  I honestly cannot remember much from the plot apart from having to ring 4 bells, but this game left a lasting impression in the memories of simply exploring the beautiful and serene world along to the ambient, relaxing soundtrack. To me, this is the mark of a good game, and I eagerly look forward to all of Nicklas's future games.
4529	1	a	Amazing Indie game. The overall atmosphere is breath-taking. The puzzles are sometimes very hard to complete and there are tens of secrets to discover.
4531	1	a	Simply awesome (and relaxing - aside from when the platforming challenges make you want to bite into your keyboard -- because *you* failed). Non-combat exploration at its best!
4533	1	a	The whole Knytt series is worth playing, but this one (as far as I know) is the only one on Steam. Luckily for you, it's also the best.   Knytt games are all about exploration, puzzles, and platforming, in that order. They're very engrossing and it's fun to run, jump, climb, and bounce over the strange and beautiful world. The movement in this game feels great - once you hear your little feet scamper up a wall as you climb it you'll fall in love.  This series of games proves that indie games don't have to hide behind quirky graphics and a 'message' (*cough* LIMBO *cough*) to be worth playing. Knytt Underground is fun, it's interesting, and it's definitely worth your time. Pick it up today.
4535	1	a	One of the best puzzly platformers ever.
4537	1	a	If you like exploration in games then you will love this one. A ridiculously large map to explore, with every screen looking unique and interesting. The music is consistently wonderful. The gameplay is a lot of fun too, with the ability to turn into a bouncy ball at will. It makes for a lot of cool puzzles, some of which are very tricky. However, the game is generally as difficult as you want it to be. If you can't get past a certain screen you can usually backtrack and find a different route. Also, loads and loads of secrets! The story, themes, and characters can be a bit polarizing, but I think they are very well done, and you can really tell Nifflas put his heart and soul into this game. In my opinion there's only one thing wrong with this game: It's slow to get going. The first two chapters are maybe an hour long each and are more like tutorials than anything else. They don't give a great impression of the full game and I feel like that first impression drives some people away. But please, just keep playing. Chapter 3 is amazing.
4539	1	a	This is one great indie platform game, made in variety of metroidvania style, a little bit challenging at some points, for those who aim for achievements it sure is bigger chalenge. Music is very atmosferic and good, there are a lot of relaxing tunes, and some creepy, if you don't wanna spend money on this i would recommend at least listening game soundtrack. There is very little combat in this game, main focus is puzzle solving and questing, what can be big downside at first look but it isn't, this is not game's aim so that doesn't really matter. In total there are three chapters, first two as some kind of introduction and third one as the main game where whole game world can be explored, as in first two it can be done only small part of it because you control different characters at that chapters, and at third you can switch between those two whenever you want. I'm sure one day i will be back to play Knytt Underground again, make sure you do it too!
4541	1	a	I like this game a lot, for a few reasons.  Gameplay consists of platforming, exploration, and item collection. The enjoyment of this game for me comes in with the characters, the atmosphere, and the setting. While there is no combat or complex puzzles and a lot of quests dead end and have no rewards, what you are left with is a game you play for the story. If the story isn't to your liking here then you probably wont like the game, but it worked out pretty well for me. I liked the interaction and development between the characters, and the game doesn't feel held back when it comes to discussing a few unpleasant topics or having characters act vulgar or make violent expressions when it fits (hence the game's Mature ESRB rating). The game's art-style for character portraits was initially a turn-off for me but I found myself not really minding it later into the game. The game also has good sound and art design for its environments, and can be very nicely ambient in atmosphere. The setting and lore of the game was very appealing to me too, and gives the player a few humorous moments thanks to meta-knowledge that the characters in the story dont posess.   Performance - No issues, runs fine, rebindable controls, graphics options are satisfactory. Controls are fairly tight and platforming is not very problematic. Some puzzles are hard, but not excessively so, and the game is very much non-punishing for failure-retry in its puzzles. There are optional parts with quite difficult puzzles, but those are presented completely aside from the main setting of the game.  Its a very good game, and quite long too for an indie game. I spent a lot of time enjoying myself and exploring things, and seeking out a few optional achievements, and put in about 20 hours into the game. I know this sort of enjoyment that is more story than gameplay driven is not for everyone, so a lot of people might find the game boring or lose interest, but I would definately reccommend it. 
4543	1	a	I cannot recommend this game enough.   The Knytt franchise at this point has gained a good bit of history. Underground's predecessors might even be older than some of the folks reading this review. Fortunately, they are all available on the developer's website, free of charge. Since 2006, I've played them many times; seriously, they're some of the most charming games out there. If you're on the fence about this title, look up Nifflas and give Knytt Stories a test drive - you won't regret it.  Knytt Underground is a game of simple two-dimensional platforming and exploration, broken up into three chapters. The first two chapters are short mini-stories introducing your characters - one, a humanoid who can scramble up walls, and the other, a strange ball with elastic properties. The third chapter is the main draw, and has the two main characters join forces to accomplish a great quest. The quest itself is basically a series of mini-fetch-quests, but that hardly matters. The fun comes from exploring the enormous, intricate map. Level design seems relatively minimalist, but the gradual change from region to region, and the charming, easter-egg like decorations on every screen are the real reward. Expect a lot of soft, ambient lights, soothing sounds and music, and a satisfying, effortless grace to your navigation. There's no frustration here, and navigation is pure joy.  If you're coming for hardcore gaming, I'd stay away; this is not that game. Also, don't expect much in terms of story; Underground has inexplicably included a couple of fairies to join you on your grand adventure; neither of them are very interesting, none of the dialogue is well-written, and one of them has a penchant for dropping F-bombs, detracting from the family-frendliness of the game. It's kept to a minimum, though, so it's not enough to detract from such a joyful exploration experience. Give the original Knytt games a go, and if you love them as much as I do, go ahead and get this, too. Support this developer. This is every bit as good as I was hoping, and I would love to keep revisiting this series for a long time to come.
4545	1	a	compared to similar games, this has a tremendous amount of gameplay, adding up to around 24 hours. I recommend this for all fans of metroidvania games and I definetely recommend buying it at full price as it is much deeper than similarly priced indie games which only last around 4 hours on average.  Also, this has one of the best controls ever in a platformer and if anything I recommend buying this just so you can enjoy platforming the way it is meant to be enjoyed.  Oh, in case you are wondering about the M rating... have you played LISA? well...
4547	1	a	If you like anything Nifflas has ever done or if you like everything he's ever done, you will like this game. This like the original Knytt + Stories + Saira all rolled into one with extra on top. If you play the demo don't think that this game is as short as the first two chapers. The world starts for real in chapter 3 and is 49x49 screen with tons of secrets. You will also see lots of things from previous games (locations, items, references). The world building here is amazing, Nifflas uses everything available to create a real sense of a different but real place.  You are Mi Sprocket, a sprite who cannot talk. But the game has conversations, how does this work? Soon you will get two companions and you can choose who should have the conversation each time. Your companions have quite different world views. The story is not a fixed story but creates an incredible sense of a journey and you feel your companions have real growth.   The graphics are beautiful. Coming from previous Nifflas games I didn't like the silhouettes at first but once you see how it is used in combination with the backgrounds it becomes apparent it is his best style yet. It manages to be so atmospheric. Especially in combination with the sound and music. There are over 100 tracks (which you can download for free on his site).  My game of 2013.   PS: My playtime is low because I played the non steam version back in March. The game is 20+ hours easily.
4549	1	a	Here's your low-stress platforming fix. Beautiful backgrounds. Potty-mouthed fairies. Lovely music. Exploration-heavy gameplay. Funny little quests. Rewards for looking close.  There are challenges when you want them -- it's up to you when you decide to tackle them.
4551	1	a	Gorgeous art, fantastic music, and ultimately one of the most engaging and satisfying games I've played in a while. Absolutely recommend this game.
4553	1	a	Great platforming game with some very nice artwork. What I really liked about it is that once you're out of the tutorial/prologue bit you have all the abilities you're going to get. So you'll never encounter something you're unable to get because you don't have the right skills yet. If you can see it, you can get it. Huge map with lots of secrets to find, some interesting characters to meet and a decent story.
4555	1	a	As a fantasticly atmospheric game, with top notch platforming and a well written and unique story, Knytt Underground is my favorite game of 2013.
4557	1	a	For many years Nifflas has been developing games on the PC. The two most notable of these titles are Within a Deep Forest and Knytt. Within a Deep Forest had players taking control of a sentient bouncing ball that had to save the world from a bomb. The game focused on the bouncing physics of different types of balls of different weights and materials.  Knytt focused on a little hero of the same name needing to find parts to fix a crashed spaceship so that he could get back home. The mechanics here dealt with the notion of climbing and sticking to walls. Both of these games have now been combined to create Knytt Underground which marks Nifflas’ first move into the realm of console gaming.  Split into three chapters, Knytt Underground has players take on the role of the mute Mi Sprocket as she explores a huge environment. Her aim is to look for human artefacts and complete quests in a Metroidvania style. The first two chapters act as short tutorials to help players understand the mechanics of how Mi and then Bob the ball handle. By chapter three the two characters have magically been morphed together allowing players to change from Mi to Bob at will.  This allows for some situations requiring lightning reflexes as you change from Mi to the bouncing ball mid-air to cannon off the landscape at all sorts of weird and wonderful angles in order to reach new areas. As well as the bouncing and climbing there are different coloured plumes of smoke which give temporary abilities. These range from turning Mi invisible, making her jump higher or turning her into a set that can shoot horizontally or vertically.  Everything is designed as a means for you to get to another locations and this is where Knytt Underground really works well. Nifflas games before this have always focused on short bursts of quick reflexes and skill. When Knytt Underground asks players to do the same it comes to life in a flurry of ever changing physics and colourful plumes of smoke. (Note to developer – a colour-blind filter would really help with those plumes of smoke)  However, in Knytt Underground there are often long stretches of exploration through empty screens to reach these areas. Sometimes the beautiful graphics and sound create a haunting and ambient environment which you don’t mind trekking through. At other times it can all be a little dull as you wander through empty screen after empty screen. This was an issue on the PS3 version but strangely, seems to be much less of an issue on the PC. Maybe we’ve mellowed a bit, or maybe it just fits the system a bit better.  When Knytt Underground works it works well but when it doesn’t it can feel a bit empty. This isn’t helped by the seeming lack of progress you make. There are numerous quests and items to discover but on completing or collecting them it doesn’t seem to mean much. Of course it all adds up in the end but the game could do with tweaking its risk reward system to help players feel a greater sense of achievement after they have overcome some of the incredibly fiendish screens.  It is worth highlighting just how lovely the game looks and sounds. This game is beautiful and the music is of the highest standard. We expect no less from a Nifflas game and in that department Knytt Underground can never be faulted with a stunningly ambient atmosphere created throughout. The spaced out save points also seem less of an issue in the PC version, even though some of them are still some distance away from tricky sections of the game and back tracking is something that can begin to hinder the experience. We lost count of the amount of times we trekked along a tunnel for five or six screens only to reach a character telling us we needed to bring a certain item to them. This then meant trekking back through all the screens again. There really isn’t a need for this and you wonder if the game would have benefitted from a slightly smaller, more focused, map without many of the empty screens - or at least the ability to teleport between save points.  Overall, Knytt Underground is another promising game for Nifflas. The look and sound of the game is gorgeous and easily rivals the best 2D artwork out there. The game itself gives players a huge world to explore but many may well feel that it lacks focus and a real sense of rewards for the skill you need in order to progress. Those looking for an adventure set at a slower pace will love it, while others will be left wanting a bit more excitement.  7/10
4559	1	a	OMG a good, gigantic platformer!
4561	1	a	In my top 10 favorite games ever. Atmospheric and emotional, with hours of exploration.
4563	1	a	One of the best platform games ever made. Believe me.
4565	1	a	Knytt Underground is a sequel to an indie platform game that was making waves online. Now available on Steam, the game has you playing the role of a little girl who looks like some kind of evil doll. Look at her run, that’s evil. Freaky little legs swinging around like sticks. But either way this little girl goes on a metroid style quest to explore temples and dungeons. While the game may look like a first grader’s attempt at drawing, the level design is pretty solid. The dialog is a bit strange, and for some reason the game got an M rating because somehow characters get into sexual conversations and curse a lot. There’s something a little… special? about this game. If you can get past that, you will find some fun platforming and metroidvania style platforming. Plus now I’m going to beat it just to find out what that M rating was for.  Watch the full review on  ShotGaming.com  Steam Shots EP124
2103	0	a	Great at first, then pointless, then just plain terrible!  This game was great throughout the entire game, only having a downside of too many 'pointeless' quests. But once you reach the ending? WOW! What a piece of crap it turns out to be! It has one of the WORST endings I have EVER witnessed for a video game! And it was done delibirately by the developer! (as there is tons of extra 'secret' stuff that could have been cut out FOR A PROPER ENDING!). And the many secrets of this game are so utterly pointless, there is really no reward for suffering trying to find/complete them.  But hey, if you are one of those people who like to play games just for the arcade aspect of them, and not for the plot, then you'll enjoy this game! I felt totally dissappointed after having spent over 30 hours to get through it!
2104	0	a	 A Paladin's Steam Review: Knytt Underground. It's Too Much of A Good Thing.
4567	1	a	It feels somewhat like a free roam Oddworld game, with unbelievable amount of secrets scattered all across the huge map; if the story seems boring for someone- he can skip first 2 short chapters and head to the chapter three, with the map that feels just overwelming in size as you explore it; I can wander for hours, use characters abilities to reach diffirent places, while still experiencing that quite fun feeling that with enough skill and time- you can access just any place you want, you explore as you like, listening to chilling music with backgrounds that only add to the sleepy and mysterious atmosphere.  One who finds the plot interesting may also face handful of diffirent creatures, each with their own stories and/or optional tasks that may make traveling through the world easier. I would also note the great fairy companion Cilia, her intelligence and cynicism really brought a few smiles for me.  If you like slower platforming games and exploration, pick it up, it can come with some pretty big discounts during sales, there should be a demo somewhere on the internet, not much of a free roam but shows some of the gameplay to test.  Edit: Actually I think it's one of my favourite games ever, while Knytt Stories are endless, Underground is huge and complete, and I'm happy to have 100% completed it. If Nifflas decides to make the same type of game, but expand it to the point where I could zoom and scroll through the map, and it would stretch so far that it would require me to plan entire travels, because of how 'open-world-rpgy' long they would take- then that's the game that I could take on a deserted island. It's just that entrancing to play it for me.
4569	1	a	BUY THIS GAME, NOW RIGHT NOW  (TRUST ME I'M NOT BEING SARCASTIC AND I'VE PLAYED 30h+ ON VITA)
4571	1	a	An second part of an allready excellent game. A metroid-like level but with an extra compexity twist. Needs time investing though!
4573	1	a	Good platforming, and the game runs very smoothly. But the story serves no purpose besides trying to be humerous, which in turn ruins the atmosphere. NPCs are also useless, would have been more apropriate to add deposits or holders for items in the world (i.e. making 2 holders for the candelabras, and the door would open after they were placed.) All in all fun to play, but would have been better served with a few design changes.
4575	1	a	Knytt is a chill, low-stakes exploration game with trippy music and background art.
4577	1	a	 Knytt Underground  is a puzzle-Metroidvania with lovely scenery and plenty of secrets to find. You play as a sprite who turns into a bouncy ball. Some of the bouncing puzzles are a bit frustrating, but you usually won't get sent too far back if you mess up. Your sprite form can climb walls and has better control than the ball, but can't jump as high.  Controls are rebindable. It uses an 'up to jump' control scheme, which might take some getting used to, but it actually works to the game's benefit, as you can jump to a wall and immediately start climbing.  The main menu is a playable area. To pick a chapter, move onto it and press the action button. Look closely and you can also find easter eggs and bonus levels. Even outside of the main game there is much to explore.  If an exploration focused puzzle-platformer sounds like your kind of game,  Knytt Underground  will make a fine addition to your library. Absolutely worth considering.
4579	1	a	love it love it driving me nuts :)))) if you like platform puzzlers (abe's oddesy) this is a must.
2105	0	a	Unfortunatly the good old Nifflas is completely gone. Knytt Stories and Within a Deep Forest were wonderful games and I could buy it if they were on steam. Knytt Underground contains the all worst things that Nifflas ever done.
4581	1	a	Tried to play it on the keyboard and mouse. This seems much better suited to a controller. Fun game but needs a controller to avoid mega hand cramps and limited functionality.
4583	1	a	Intersting platformer that makes you work. It's basically your normal indie game. Cool background with pixelated characters and cool filters. Not much of a story as you are kind of just sent to wander around and collect things. The music is AWESOME. All in, worth the 2.99 I spent on the humble bundle. Don't know if I would have spent more than that for this game. Fun, but not worth spending too much money.
4585	1	a	Knytt Underground absorbs you into a beautiful world. The music is atmospheric and changes according to your location. There's striking and interesting scenery wherever you go, and the intricate maze of platforming puzzles fits naturally in these mysterious and serene environments.  This game would be much better if there was no dialog. With rare exception, the humor is uncomfortable and embarrassing and the dramatic parts are offensive somehow. However, the often-preachy and confused writing can be ignored for the most part, as this is predominantly an  excellent  exploration puzzle platformer with only a nod to story.  I'd recommend a gamepad. Some parts expect quick reactions and precise timing where activating abilities mid-air is vital. There are a few puzzles involving the somewhat erratic bouncing physics which are frustrating, but when your character dies, you just restart at the last safe spot you were standing, so there's not much tedious repetition.
2109	0	a	This game doesn't work. It looks very fun, but I can't play it. The many of the controls in the options simply say 'error.' I have browsed forum after forum, swapped out and editted files as instructed, but still no controls. Can't transform. Can't open inventory. Can't play.  Even after multiple fresh installs, this game is unplayable.  0/10 No controls. I will be happy to change this review if I can control it one day.
4587	1	a	It's a good game.
2110	0	a	Way too much time is spent travelling around empty screens. Back and forth. Really needs a useful fast-travel system.
2111	0	a	If you like to put 10 hours into something just to be told to go ♥♥♥♥ yourself, this game is for you.
2112	0	a	I bought this game thinking it'd be like a remaster of the original, but it's just an incredibly simplified and boring version, now with extra pandering.
2113	0	a	The controls are very loose, its pretty diffcult to control. I constantly feel like my charcter is on an ice slick. Mix this with virtually no hook and no explnation of where you are and why you are doing anything, it's a pretty frustrating start. Very diffcult to get in to.
2114	0	a	A fun game for a while but loses it's flair after the second chapter. It's pretty much a constant back and forth through the map quest. Irritating platforming that just did hold my interest. The story was not interesting to me and got to were I was just skipping through dialog cause I didn't care anymore.  The game can be beat in a good amount of time as the first two levels are short. The third is the lengthy one and is were I decided to just give up. My interest in games has changed over the years I tend to find some games I would have loved before boring and not worth finishing,  In my opinion I wouldn't recommend this to any friends. Some may love it as the reviews show but for me it's a no.
4589	1	a	Neat little platformer, not difficult at all but good enough to waste a couple of hours if you find it in a bundle
4591	1	a	Cute, but meh. A jumping puzzle just bored me...not enough substance to make me want to work on the puzzles.
2115	0	a	Pretty backgrounds, terrible animations and simple gameplay. That's what Knytt Underground is all about. As far as I can tell, at least. Thank God I got this game in a bundle because it simply isn't worth €9. It's cute, in a way, but running around collecting useless stuff for NPCs so that I can enter new areas feels like a chore. Other games manage to pull it off in a way that it somehow can still be enjoyed. I'm sorry to say that Knytt just isn't one of those games. I'm not saying you should avoid it, but at least wait for a sale before getting this.  [Rating: 69/100]
2116	0	a	Good game but I would prefer to use a controller, you'll probably like it more if you prefer a keyboard or have an app to emulate using a keyboard with your controller but since this game was also made for consoles there's no reason not to add controller functionality to this game.
2117	0	a	8oring. After playing awhile, I asked myself, why am I playing?
2118	0	a	I HATED that game Visualy his very nice, but the dialog... OMG!!! so crapy... make my ears bleeding   
2119	0	a	Weird game but good for people that like strategic games
4593	1	a	The graphics seem a bit clunky on the outset but the gameplay is fun and puzzley and the humor is nice. It's really funny to see how the future cultures see human artifacts from the past (current) technology age. The game itself really gets going in Chapter 3. There is so much to explore, the world is vast and beautiful, even haunting and spooky sometimes, the challenges are engaging. Just like Super Metroid, this is a good game to play alone at night just exploring the universe.
4595	1	a	 http://youtu.be/0AXJgkP4U-M 
4597	1	a	This is easily my favorite video game (I'm a casual gamer). I am most impressed by the unification of the narrative, graphic design, and soundtrack--it all meshes as a Gesammtkunstwerk. I highly recommend downloading the free soundtrack (approx. 4 hours of music) if you like glitchy, atmospheric electronica (this has become my go-to work soundtrack; I do a lot of writing, and it's a great, unobtrusive soundtrack). The Knytt world is pretty vast with tons of caverns to explore. Even though I've completed the game (by paying the gatekeepers before the bells--I'm working on doing it by circumventing them), I continue to play for a bit in the evening simply because I find the combination of the visuals and the music so relaxing. If you enjoy puzzle/platformers, and you appreciate artistry in your games, this is most highly recommended.
4599	1	a	I genuinely enjoyed it.
2120	0	a	I bought but didn't bother to play it since it doesn't support controllers at all. Seriously, how can a platformer not support controllers?
4601	1	a	When you do get to the end, you're probably going to want to come back to the beginning - or at least the beginning of third chapter. Knytt Underground is a more conspicuously narrative-driven sequel to Knytt Stories and Within A Deep Forest, and puts the platforming mechanics of each (climbing and bouncing, respectively) to good use. Those two mechanics are most of what you'll be doing in this game - besides gawking, since the art and soundtrack are absolutely lovely - and honestly it's a lot of fun just to get around. The game world's vast, once you get into it, and if you want to take it all in, you can easily spend upwards of twenty hours just exploring its labyrinthine and visually stunning caves, tunnels, and underwater labs. It's paced a bit slow for a metroidvania adventure - Knytt Underground is about exploration, with very few enemies and a lot of map. But it's the world design, not the enemies, that make this game what it is, and the environments will make you work out how to get from A to B in some very clever ways. There are caverns and side challenges that require you to string together perfectly timed mid-air button presses, secret rooms (over 500 of them in addition to the 1,440 that appear on the map) and a huge variety to the places you'll visit that makes discovering a new area feel exciting. What a game! Knytt Underground brings together the knuckle-biting platforming challenges with an endearing and memorable landscape, introspective dialogue, really genuinely fantastic sound design, and over three and a half hours of gorgeous background music. Don't miss the music, it's really great.
4603	1	a	Zen af. Don't even need to be baked to fully enjoy this one.
4605	1	a	cute little platformer with nice graphics and an immersive atmosphere.
4607	1	a	A great exploration game. The OST is fantastic, the best ambient soundtrack for a game I can think of. The map is huge and waiting to be explored, but not to the point of being impossible or overwhelming. The scenic visuals are beautiful silhouettes with colored backgrounds.  The characters leave a lot to be desired. Their artstyles are very unflattering, and the dialogue in the game feels very low quality. If it wasn't for them, this game would be perfect.  The game combines the Knytt series with Within a Deep Forest, while at the same time changing the upgrade-based gameplay of each. Instead, it begins as linear, having you learn both forms of basic gameplay, then combines them into one for the bulk of the game. The only powerups are area-specific, which is both good and bad.
4609	1	a	This game was pretty much my life at one point. There's so much to do and the world feels very alive. Great music and gameplay. A coozy game you can get really immersed in.
4611	1	a	Enormous world, tons of stuff to do, great for wasting time.
4613	1	a	This game took me very much by surprise. It's a treat. There is so much to explore, so many secrets to uncover! And it really is fun to explore the entire world. I never got bored with the wide variety of different environments there are. The ambience, visuals, jumps, secret finding, avoiding laser beams, and such combine for a very memorable experience.  My only complaint is that the story is rather pretentious at times and somewhat unsatisfying in the end.  But I still had a blast and was not ready for it to be over when I finished.
4615	1	a	A surprisingly long game (I spent about 13 hours filling out 90% of everything). It's a exploration heavy metroidvania which is pretty puzzle based. This game has an incredibly expansive map that you explore and the more you play the more lore you uncover. It's really interesting.  If you like exploring, lore, depth, completing all sorts of quests, and other stuff, this game is for you. If you like fast paced gameplay, action, short games, and instant gratification, then it is not.   ALSO this game should NOT be rated M. It's only rated M because there's a little bit of language but that's it. It would have been E if there was none of that.
4617	1	a	I already was a fan of Nifflas' knytt games, so I purchased this one. It's definitely worth the money.  The game is first of all visually impressive - just as expected. Sometimes I wonder a bit if the experience wouldn't have been even better if the ground wasn't all black, throughout the whole world. One gets used to it, but the other knytt games had colored background, which looked a bit more friendly. However, it may be that black is a good choice to clearly differentiate between the background scenery and the ground you're walking on.  Storywise, well, forget the story. It is really not necessary. Surprisingly, this game is much more about characters than about story - something I didn't expect. There are *lots* of NPCs to talk to, and almost every one of them has an own story and personality. What impressed me most is that once you reach the third chapter, you don't have any red line to follow, so you get the dialogues between the two main (talking) characters in some random order depending on which places you visit in which order. But although there are some main themes repeatedly exploited in the dialogue, it never gets messed up if you change the order. As for the dialogue itself, it's really excellently crafted and highly intelligent.  While you're exploring the - really vast - world, you'll also explore the protagonists and the history of this world. Most games are about story advancement (and sometimes character advancement), but this one is purely about exploration. There's so much to discover you'll hardly remember an area you already visited. The game also features quite some subtle humor if you pay attention.  And did I mention the soundtrack yet? It's awesome.  Now, nothing is perfect. I'll flag the following comments as spoiler although it really is just a very mild one.    One thing I don't like about this game is that it's breaking the forth wall. Having the protagonists talk to the author talking steals away some of the atmosphere. But this only happens rarely, so it's forgivable. Another thing is that one does not get to know the main protagonist much. We do get to know something about her family, but almost nothing about herself. I know that this is a usual technique to make the player identify himself with the protagonist, but in this world where everyone else has a story, it's really strange that the protagonist lacks one. We don't even know whether she actually cannot speak or just doesn't want to.    Oh, and the super secret challenges section is really, really,  really  nasty.  &lt;rant&gt;Just one last side note: I really cannot understand why this game got an M rating by the ESRB. Is critical thinking forbidden for teens in the USA? Yeah, it may be offensive if you're some fundamentalist, but seriously, why should such people dictate which games are appropriate for teens? Here in Germany, it's approved for age 12 and up.&lt;/rant&gt;
4619	1	a	It begins as some 2-hour time consumer that can be played in the morning and forgotten in the evening. Then it consequently evolved into one of greatest platformers I have ever played. For anyone who loves to explore beautiful, vast world full of surprises (including its seemingly shallow story) it is a must have.
4621	1	a	Gameplay: Atmospheric exploration combined with clever-feeling, hard but not frustrating platforming  Content: A game world spreading over more than 1500 screens, with beautiful background art and wonderful music. A few hidden easter eggs as achievements.  Interface Design: This very simple game doesn't need a lot. Controls are arrow keys and A/S, you also have a map and item screen for informational purposes.  Sounds: Nice, relaxing but upbeat, atmospheric music. Especially of note in this game are the very carefully designed and excellent foot step and ball bouncing sound effects.  Visuals: Very small characters give a lot of importance to the surrounding environment. The walls are simple black blocks so it's easy to tell foreground from background.  Style: Quirky dialogue with some tongue-in-cheek humor. Moments of discovery and sometimes being creeped out.  Annoyances: Towards the end game, walking through a lot of already-explored areas becomes tedious and time-consuming.  Value: The game is already fairly priced at 7$, and a complete no-brainer when it goes on even a mild discount sale, if you like the genre that is.  Replayability: You'll get more or less 25 hours of exploration out of this game, after that, not much more.
4623	1	a	This is the best game games I've played in the past couple of years. Great atmosphere and so many secrets to discover.   Highly recommended
4625	1	a	This is a cool little puzzle adventure sidescroller. Dark and exotic maps will keep you comming back for more!
4627	1	a	You'd think that running around aimlessly at first would become quite tedious, but no. Somehow the exquisite yet simple graphics, quests, and storyline have captivated me. Not to mention that maneuvering your way around the killer robots is also quite entertaining.
4629	1	a	I really like the sound when you walk in this game! Other than that awesome music and atmosphere.
4631	1	a	Huge map open to eplore whereever you please(after getting to the 3rd chapter). So much hidden levels and collectables all over the map and even menu that you wil frequent a guide to see it all. And of course simpel but challenging plattforming, great background OST and fairly charming characters. A 'metroidvania' without upgrades or fights but way more fun exploring and good world building.
4633	1	a	I love this game. It is the sort of thing that you can play for ten or fifteen minutes and feel like you accomplished something, or intend to play for an hour and find yourself still playing after four.  The ball mechanics are as close to perfect as you can find in a game. Importantly, there is some ability for course correction mid-air, so you are not bound to just ricocheting around based only on your bounce. And the transformation mechanic lets you move in ways that neither the sprite nor the ball could alone.  The core of the game is exploration. Puzzles are usually “how do I get there from here? and typically aren’t more than four or six rooms. They are spread about often enough to be interesting, yet sparse enough that at no time does it feel like you just completed a difficult challenge only to be rewarded with a harder one, and in fact almost always do reward you. The rewards vary from inventory items (which may be quest related) to story exposition, and sometimes earthquakes that open up new paths elsewhere.  Death is mostly non-punishing, typically at most it resets you to the last safe position you were in, which is usually in the room you are currently in. If you collected an item just before dying, it does not reset the item. That said, you do have to then make it to a save point to keep the progress after leaving the game.  Mi, the character, is mute. When you have a conversation with an NPC, you can choose if you want your friends Dora or Cilla to answer for you. Dora is generally going to give an optimistic or positive answer, while Cilla tends to be cynical if not mean. But they can and will also surprise you.  While I very much enjoyed this game, the experience was certainly heightened by having played the developer’s previous games, which are not currently available on Steam. I think it stands alone well, however there are many references to several other games (including ones for both Knytts and the Ball) that were very cool for those in the know.  As much as a third of the game’s rooms are hidden off-map. Some are short or long challenges or even just “easter eggs accessible from secret paths accessible from the chapter select area - hidden in secret tunnels.  Also please note the rating! Cila in particular can be quite vulgar, and both of the fairies have histories that might be surprising and a bit colorful.   I do recomend this game! 
4635	1	a	So much better than it seems at first. Combines awesome audiovisuals with a surprisingly rich world full of interesting characters with personal stories. One of the most fun platformers I have ever played.
4637	1	a	+ Tons of exploration, I loved exploring each and every little corner of this world. Don't let the first two chapters fool you, those are just to ease you into it. After that you'll experience a great deal of freedom while traversing the map.  + Beautiful atmospherical graphics. Just look at those screenshots.  + Nice music as well. No wait, the music is awesome, and so is the sound design.  + Very simple but fun, tight mechanics.   ~ Don't expect any kind of deep emotional storyline. It's cute and funny at times and there is some (actually quite some) intruiging lore to try to make sense of, but the way it's conveyed didn't work quite enough for me, personally. I would have loved a bit more of immersive style of writing, the wit of the dialogues pull me out of it too much. Or rather they fail to draw me in.  - Unfortunately the fixed resolution is kinda low, especially on a 27' monitor. I have played this before on the PS Vita (one of my favorite games on that platform) and there it looks pretty clean and sharp. Not as much now, although it's still pretty enough to get fully immersed in. So arguably the PC is not the best way to play this game, maybe. Maybe.   Having said that I would nevertheless heartily recommend this game for anyone fond of 2D platforming world exploration kind of games. It's very satisfting discovering new areas while jumping around like the most agile spelunker in history. Get this game, especially when it's on sale.!
4639	1	a	My feelings on this one are a bit mixed, and in general I will give a recommendation to an indie game I have mixed feelings about.   There are a lot of ideas here, but I think the story-telling in particular didn't work out. The stories were so spread out and so jumbled over the many hours of play, it was difficult to necessarily remember characters from time to time as they came up. Even with the three protagonists, this was a problem, as I couldn't always recall what details were true of which one.   The second thing that didn't work out was the warp zones. The entries to them were so spread out, and the exits not marked on the map at all. So it always seemed better not to use them and walk straight to where I was going, rather than possibly walk the same distance and break a crystal.  What is great is the feeling that you are exploring a real space. This isn't an over map and castles, everywhere is connected to everywhere else, there are no barriers.  There are also some quite surprisingly beautiful set pieces, with music that wonderfully accompanies them.  And as in Knytt, the pitter patter of the running and jumping is very satisfying.  Finally, I have not idea why this game is M-rated. Because one of the characters is a lesbian? I find making a game M-rated simply because lesbians exist extremely offensive.
4641	1	a	This game is beautiful and atmospheric. It has some of the most subtly clever level design ive ever experienced and endless secrets to discover. If you like exploration/puzzle/platformer games then you will definitely like knytt underground.   Pros:  -Very dificult at times but not so dificult that it isn't fun -Amazing soundtrack -Clearly the developer put their heart into this game -a massive map to explore -the game lets you complete the story at your own pace and with items in different orders so it has replay value  Cons:  -Honestly none, this game is so much fun I cannot do it justice    
4643	1	a	Knytt Underground is an atmospheric exploration platformer with a huge world, great soundtrack and fun mechanics. However its story and characters have their unexpected quirks which may put you off, while late-game can get tedious with lengthy backtracking.  This game has left me with very mixed feelings, but my overall enjoyment still outweighs the frustrations and disappointments. For the measely $5 there's plenty of quality content even if you ignore the main story.    THE GOOD:
4645	1	a	A really unique platformer. I love to just run around exploring in beautiful and fascinating environments without any hectic. It´s perfect as a stress reliever but it´s not unchallenging, so it doesn´t get boring. Also it´s really great to know that there are optional secrets everywhere, so if you feel like exploring a bit more than usual, there is always something to find.  The story is rather lush, but it´s much more about the people you meet, rather than saving the world. All of them have their own little story and it´s refreshing to get to know their world view instead of just saving their day and be done with it.   To round it up it has a nice soundtrack. I recommend this game for everyone who likes platformers and for hard working casuals, because it´s great to come back to this game every now and then, explore some more and relax.
4647	1	a	One of the best games I have ever played...
