0	1	a	Yes AH lead me to buy this and it was worth it, but mostly at only the sale price of £3.50 for the lack of online multiplayer of which the xbox version has the the lack of controller support.
2	1	a	This is a fun game to play with friends, seeing as how I also own it on Xbox 360, I've played many fun rounds. Its still too bad the second one no longer exists.
4	1	a	Good game, with lots of different courses. The map creater is very basic, but can still create a few good courses.
6	1	a	6min of gameplay         YouTube™ Video:  6min of 3D Ultra Minigolf Adventures - highlights&nbsp;
8	1	a	Looking for something completely insane and totally useless. This is the game for you. Four courses of unbelievable mini golf impossibility, four crazy characters, power-ups, obstacles, tournaments and a course editor. 3d Ultra have made some interesting games out of simple ideas and this is another of those. May not have the longevity of games like Killing Floor, but will leave you a zombie none-the-less and the kids will enjoy it.
10	1	a	Fun, Easy, great graphics
12	1	a	this is so dark chocolate
14	1	a	It's mini golf. What else could you ever ask for? Change the F in 'golf' to D and you get Mini Gold, which is what this game is. Great golf. Good place to take a date. I'd take a date there, if I ever had a date to go on.  9/10. I'm lonely.
16	1	a	I had a lot of fun with this game. It's a very light-hearted approach to mini golf, and the music is really cool in a lot of places. The controls are a bit frustrating at times, but how many games get those right? A completely G-rated, easy going game that everyone can enjoy. Or when you need a break from blowing things up.
18	1	a	This game is the ♥♥♥♥.  Someone bought this for $0.01 AUS (about half a penny) then gifted it to me, and I still feel ripped off.
20	1	a	Really really fun game to play drunk with friends.
22	1	a	I LOVE this game! Sure, it may be from 2006, but it's still in my heart the best minigolf game out there! Better than Golf with Your Friends, and even better than Tower Unite minigolf! No offense to either of those games, which are both good, but 3D Ultra Minigolf Adventures takes 1st for minigolf in my opinion.
0	0	a	The graphics are okay and the hole designs are creative but the gameplay leaves something to be desired.   Carefully planning and crafting an approach to each hole followed by watching your perfectly executed shot drop delicately into the cup is the magic in mini-golf. This game lacks that appeal for several reasons. The controls are limited (you only control direction and power) as there is no ability to put backspin on the ball or angle the ball off of your club. The physics are cartoonish leading to frustrating moments where reality does not align with your plan. Additionally, certain objects and boundaries/walls within the holes themselves are not modeled very well and can never be trusted to bounce where one would expect (imagine running in an action-oriented game in a wide-open field then being halted by an invisible wall).  Edit: Realized this game was made in 2006. My expectations are lowered but the comments above are still applicable today.
1	0	a	This game didn't ever get updated.
2	0	a	There's no online multiplayer, only local.
3	0	a	This game was released in 2006.  At the time it might have been innovative. Today, not so much. It's entirely playable. Just not fun.
4	0	a	Played a round. Nothing I saw would make me want to play another. Sometimes it was fun just to whack a ball as hard as you could to see what the goofy physics would do.   Grade: F
5	0	a	valve please give us the ability to delete games from our steam account
6	0	a	Removed after just 1 hour playing: with the ball I have ended in a 'no man land' where there is no way to exit (any kind of touch just gave 'out of bounds', whatever the intensity or the direction). Moreover, controls are awfully weird. This kind of bugs and the low quality user interface make the game impossible to be played. Just a waste of money and time. DON'T TAKE IT EVEN FOR FREE!
7	0	a	Too luck based. Many holes have a hole in one path that can give the lucky player that gets it a massive advantage if the other players fail to do the same even once. It's a shame because there is a lot to like about this game otherwise.
8	0	a	I find this game is too unrealistic, I know that is the point, but it is more that you have to learn new physics on different courses. It is more frustrating then fun, for me at least. I do not recommend this game if you love minigolf, because it is too arcady.
9	0	a	This is the 3rd entry from my Steam library, 3D Ultra Minigolf Adventures Deluxe from 2006. The opinions expressed in this video are completely biased and personal and in no way reflect an objective viewpoint.         YouTube™ Video:  3D Ultra Minigolf Adventures Deluxe ... Old Guy and his library&nbsp;
10	0	a	I don't need to tell you much except that you should avoid this game at all costs. I got this game free, and it basiccally lost all value within 10 minutes.  Verdict: GET THE HELL AWAY. GO. RUN!
11	0	a	One look at the title should be enough to evaluate the quality of this game. It's every bit as bargain bin as it sounds. It's a passable attempt at minigolf if you're looking for a game that looks and feels like it belongs on the playstation circa 1996. Sadly, for all its attempts to sound cool with its '3D' and its 'ultra' it's actually pretty boring and pretty tame. It's very dated now but even by the standards of 15 years ago it would have been below average at best. Don't waste your money.
12	0	a	My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through.' I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.
13	0	a	Do not buy this version! There is a newer version, '... for the Awesome', which has all this game's levels, plus new levels, better graphics, controller support, and a Linux version.
14	0	a	Here is a game that loses its appeal in about 30 minutes. Sure, the first 5 or 10 minutes you think the game is kinda cool, but by minute 15 you will have decided the game is a bit boring and repititous, by minute 30 you will have decided the game is no longer fun to play, and after 2 hours of game play you will think there are far better uses of Harddrive space than AaAaAA!!! - A Reckless Disregard for Gravity.
24	1	a	This game is like crack...  ...not for everyone but if it's your thing you're gonna have a hard time stopping.  I get the negative reviews for this game; it has indeed been superseeded by an improved version, (but if you're limited by old hardware like I am this version has lower system requirements), and yes it is in a sense repetitive.... but it's a base jumping game, I honestly don't know what more people were hoping for. You jump off things, gravity takes over and you steer, as with actual base jumping.  This game isnt rocket science, but it is challenging and although as stated above, it is the same basic action and objective in every level. However, the levels are massively varied and theres a few extra things thrown in, (hand gestures and spraypainting buildings with the mouse). Above all else this game is immersive and a huge ammount of fun, one of the most enjoyable games I've played in a long time.
26	1	a	An extremely simple concept, which often leads to very addictive games. Short description, you jump of things and try to hit the landing zone in one piece. Doing that is generally achievable. Doing it with high points, a bit more tricky, and therein lies the fun. It's kind of hard to describe, look at their promo stuff, they're not lying, it is a fun game. For the price, definitely worth it.
17	0	a	amazing what people will pay for these days
18	0	a	This is one of those games that you probably pulled out back when Steam used to do their sales events. Then you put it back away for a very long time. I don't blame you. It's fun for about 15 minutes, but then you just keep doing the same thing over and over again. There's only so much fun you can have in a game about jumping off buildings. Well....maybe that's not true, but there's only so much fun you can have in this game.  You start each round by jumping off a building. Points are scored for getting close to objects without hitting them, interacting with people (thumbs up or flipping off), flying through certain gates, and sticking your landing. This gameplay can only interest you for so long. The controls work well enough while falling, except controlling after deploying your parachute can be a little awkward.  The visuals are bright and intense, but not all that interesting. There are lots of flashing lights which could be problematic to some people. The music is fast and somewhat entertaining. Maybe the best part of the game.  I could not recommend this game for more than a few minutes playtime. Fire it up if you got it in a bundle, but you will quickly put it back away.  Grade: D+
28	1	a	DO NOT BUY THIS VERSION OF THE GAME.  Instead, buy AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! - For the Awesome because it's the exact same game + a bunch more levels.   I have a detailed review for that game on its store page. Read that maybe.   Here's a short version: Ultimately, you should watch a gameplay video and imagine about a hundred levels revolving around that central theme.  It's a unique concept executed fairly well, with a weird sense of humor and fast-paced arcade-style point collecting.
30	1	a	AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! – A Reckless Disregard for Gravity is a game in which you play a virtual basejumper who jumps through a series of maps attempting to rack up points by staying close to obstacles, spray-painting buildings, flipping off people who dislike you, and breaking plates with points on them while still landing safely. The levels are mostly very stylized (with a few which are meant to mimic natural landscapes). The game is very entertaining for the first bit, but is best experienced in bite-sized chunks. Once you've done a few levels, take a break and come back later - it can get repetitive rapidly, and while the later levels definitely add a lot more to keep track of, the core mechanics remain consistent.  It's a pity, because the later levels are the better ones in the game, but ultimately, since the replayability is based off of the levels you've unlocked it doesn't feel like there's a great deal of depth beyond what you see on the surface.  I had a good time with it. However, I've only played about 5 hours and I feel 'done' with it - I don't have any particular desire to go back into it. If you're looking for a neat, stylized experience? Hard to do any better. Just don't expect a whole lot of play time for your dollars.
32	1	a	accurate and heart-wrenching videogame adaptation of The Bridge, a 2006 Britsh-American documentary film by the acclaimed visionary Eric Steel.   in AaAaAA!!! - A Reckless Disregard for Gravity the player takes the role of an unnamed jumper reliving his leap off of the San Francisco Golden Gate Bridge in purgatory, unlocking his way to heaven by falling down stylized levels while flying near buildings (hereby believed to be the game's way of portraying the monumental, almost skyscraper like undertaking of preparing for death) and flipping off spectators (perhaps a representation of the filmmaker's own Jungian psyche) among other objectives. It is the deepest game of the 21st century and is easily the greatest example of storytelling in any medium, the Citizen Kane of videogames, proving that interaction fiction can truly become art.   Robert Ebert once remarked that this game made him reconsider his views on mortality and also jumping off of buildings. playing his game was a life-changing experience and immediately after playing i conspired to jump off a building with a parachute while trying to flip-off everyone i see on the way down.   10/10 it's ok
34	1	a	A game in which you scream because you didn't bother taking proper safety precautions. Nothing more to say about this title.
36	1	a	AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! The potato sack screwed me right up. I've played this suicide simulator and I just feel like I'm playing Rez but he's forgotten how to fly or shoot.
21	0	a	Voice acting is annoying and the gameplay is repetitive. There's no way to differentiate between the levels you can unlock so you have to spend your hard earned in game currency pretty much blindly. Fun for a little bit, but not worth it.
38	1	a	Stupidly addictive! Went in expecting little, kept going further and further, HEAD ON!
40	1	a	one of my favorite indie games on Steam, challenging but really fun to play with great atmosphere and music
42	1	a	Tangibly cyberpunk, twitchy, enjoyable in short bursts. Perfect for someone who doesn't have 5 hours at a time to invest in their play. Despite being palpably absurd, the aesthetic of the game manages to be believable in its own right, in a vein similar to Death Race 2000, perhaps, or Hackers. In an alternate timeline where the fluke discovery of 'polystructures' has radically changed human technology, culture, and society, the jaded and apathetic Gen Y crowd (undoubtedly much more so in this parallel world) apparently go in big for hurling yourself off of buildings and navigating floating metropolitan structures, all at risk of death. Easy to lose yourself in, highly recommended.
44	1	a	The community claims that this is one of the greatest indie games made. I am starting to agree. It's a simple concept done right. I'll admit that some of the 'humor' is too 'geek humor' for me and can make the game annoying at times.
46	1	a	The purest science - in video game form!
23	0	a	While this game is good, you'll be much better off buying the improved version. [Named for the awesome].
48	1	a	An interesting type of game, lots of content to enjoy.
50	1	a	An interesting type of game, lots of content to enjoy.
52	1	a	I had already played this game a bit before the Potato Sack promotion, but due to said promotion, I have finally had a chance to put a decent chunk fo time into it to make a recommendation. AaAaAA is a pretty fun - if sometimes frustrating - game which involves BASE jumping from the tops of skyscrapers, floating platforms, mountains and more. It is not a 'realistic' BASE jumping simulation, though. The levels are crazy-insane and the game is rife with a twisted sense of humor, which all comes together to make AaAaAA a very unique experience. While some levels can be extremely challenging, failure usually leaves you with a 'just one more time' feeling, rather than outright frustration. I thought AaAaAA was well worth the price of admission, and recommend it if you are looking for something completely fresh to kill some time.
54	1	a	a game about falling off a cliff and dying wow
56	1	a	This uncyclopedia article sums my experience:  http://uncyclopedia.wikia.com/wiki/AAAAAAAAA! 
25	0	a	AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA I FEEL ASLEEP!!!
58	1	a	Entertaining, addictive bite sized fun.
26	0	a	Base jumping with a wingsuit for points. Can it get more exciting than that? No, unfortunately it can't.
27	0	a	Its a skydiving score attack game. Rack up points by scraping by building by the skin of your teeth. The game gets repetitive quickly as most levels are similar, and you will have to replay levels many times to get a perfect score to unlock more levels. The game ends up being a one-trick pony.
60	1	a	I AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAAprove of this game! It's hilarious, and oddly scary. Time well wasted.
62	1	a	This game gives me more hugs and kisses than anyone else in my life  10/10 I feel loved
64	1	a	FALL from buildings, in a safely virtual environment!!!  Dated graphics, neat mechanics. No real replay value.    +10/10 for 'Zen mode' level!
33	0	a	Fun for the first 3 minutes, and then you have seen everything the game has to offer. There's certainly a lot to work up to, but I don't see much reason for it. It has a certain quirky presentation that I want to like, but still comes off as bland, like the rest of the game.  Pass on this.
34	0	a	Base jumping through a psychadelic landscape. Good to start out with but gets old VERY fast.
35	0	a	No goblets here. There might be goblets, but if there are, they are extremely well hidden, as I didn't see any in my fifteen minutes or more of playing.
36	0	a	A freestyle falling game where you're trying to score points by getting close to (but not running into) buildings. There's some interesting hidden things in some of the levels that you can try to collect, and the speed and difficulty increases as you unlock more levels. It's sort of mindless and you can zone out while playing. I wouldn't call it a stellar game, but if you have a few minutes to waste then this can work well enough.
66	1	a	This game is Super-Ultra-Awesome. I would totally recommend this game. Amazing graphics. Funny parts. I don't like 'How to Debristle Debristle Pig'. Challenging,but easy levels.An awesome theme song. I mean,LISTEN TO IT! This game is perfect.
68	1	a	Interested in precision falling? This one's for you. It's exactly what the video shows.
70	1	a	I have a great disrespect for floating buildings. I like to run into them. If you also like this, you will like this game. This game tests your control and speed, and makes you feel good inside when you flip off members of the crowd.
72	1	a	Your falling! AHHHHHHHHH! Super fun experience. Kind of exhilarating. Your ranked on each level so it gives you a challenge. You also unlock weird audio clips which is kinda funny at first but gets pretty stupid. Worth a try just to feel yourself fall, pick it up onsale for sure!
74	1	a	A superb game. A crazy idea deployed with a great soundtrack.  Sometimes it can be frustrating to get that score you need, but at the end the reward is more than enough. However do take into account I played this during the Portal 2 ARG, which raises the question if I would have played it into such intensity in other circumstances.
76	1	a	Very much fun, sometimes hard, sometimes easy. Sometimes challenge to get the best scores.
78	1	a	Summer Gaming Project Review:  Great time waster. One of the few game that made me think, 'This game could really benefit from better graphics'. Still fun though.  4/5
80	1	a	It's like JSR mixed with skydiving. Gets repetitive because the whole game revolves around dodging blocks while free-falling with the occasional wall to spray paint or fan/critics to wave at. The only lasting appeal/replay value is trying to beat your friends leaderboard scores. Worth picking up in a bundle or on sale but definitely not worth the full price.
82	1	a	best game name
84	1	a	Not bad. Fun for some mindless time filler. Also, pretty amusing and clever level names and descriptions.  In short: You fall off buildings and--on the way down--try to score as many points as possible. You get points many ways...the main ways being 'hugging' buildings (AKA flying close to them), 'kissing' objects (AKA, touching a building), and landing within the outlined circle.  Not hard to learn, but a little tricky to master. Fun to play when you're waiting for that burger to finish cooking and don't have time to open a 'big' game.
40	0	a	Game sucks.
41	0	a	Eh, it is interesting, but failed to keep me interested beyond what some interesting flash games do. For instance, I'd put One Button Bob or Acheivement Hunter beyond this game.
86	1	a	Pretty decent game but ♥♥♥♥ the Potato level.
88	1	a	Cool, I guess
46	0	a	I had a good friend that absolutely loved this game... and I couldn't really understand why. There's really nothing particularly good about this game at all.
47	0	a	Nice idea but ugly and painful to play. Hated it.
90	1	a	Great game and fun
48	0	a	The presentation is sometimes funny, but aside from that, Iiiii don't really see the appeal.
92	1	a	A light game, but full of style, something to consider when you want to have some quick play time   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDHCVVvu0wA 
94	1	a	A recommendation. This is a recommendation.
49	0	a	Great game, but if you want the best version of it go and get 'For the Awesome' as it's the same game with more levels.
96	1	a	This game has a simple concept: fall and don't hit anything and die. It will either be fast and addicting, or you will lose interest after a few levels. There's no in-between when it comes to simplicity, really.  That being said, if you ARE interested in a base jumping game like this, get AaAAaaaaa - For the Awesome. But get it during a Steam sale. It's apparently just like this game, but more recent, nicer looking, and has more levels to play. Had I known that, I wouldn't have bought this one. But it was less than 2 dollars when I got it, so I don't feel much of a loss.  Now if you'll excuse me, I've got five star scores to go and get now. &gt;8(
98	1	a	Warning: Try not to play this while doing Acid or any other hallucinogens This game is pretty fun once you get into it, There's a nice learning curve, the controls are swift and smooth. Graphics are decent and overall it's pretty damn fun to play this.
100	1	a	-Very fun to play. -You will get hugs and kisses. A lot. -Great music. -Lots of levels. Better grab it on sale. Recommended. Overall Rating: 8.0/10.0
102	1	a	Really cool and original arcade game, Skydiving through futuristic floating cities and tagging along the walls is awesome, have really enjoyed it, and the unlocking system is pretty nice.
53	0	a	A very simple game that wasn't that much fun for me.
104	1	a	This game is surprisingly fun. Totally non-serious, and a fun, crazy concept. Jump of buildings, fall a long way, try not to get smashed, and get awarded in teeth! Crazy random fun. Good music, good comedy, a good distraction. Definitely worth picking up.
106	1	a	Funny as hell game - Very simple, but entertaining.
108	1	a	it's a great game where you jump off of buildings
110	1	a	Dejoban games offers a humorously refreshing look at the concept of 'video games' and what they are meant to be as both a product for enjoyment as well as how they reflect upon the rest of the medium. This, in particular, chooses to parody the social core of video games while at the same time successfully offering an entertaining skydive simulation experience. TL:DR = Worth playing if you appreciate art. Still worth playing if you don't. A short experience either way.
112	1	a	One of the funniest, quirkiest games about jumping off a building you will ever play.  Seriously though, it's awesome. Go buy it!
114	1	a	One of the best games ever!!!
116	1	a	Do you like base jumping? This game will be for you! You jump off a building and try to get as many point as possible before opening your parachute. Fast, unforgiving and really arcady, I really like this game. Watch out for vertigo!
118	1	a	Fast paced jumping off buildings and trying to survive the fall action. The unique blend of humor and suprisingly interesting world they've built here is worth a look. Not recomended for people with extreme fear of heights ... or maybe do get it to work on facing your fears ^_^!
120	1	a	If u like jumping off of things and flipping people off this is the game for you.
122	1	a	9.5/10 A highly creative game! 
124	1	a	AaAaAA!!! Makes you falls down and smack on the ground, but that's awesome because IT'S awesome. Hug the walls, but BE CAREFUL! THEY HUG BACK TOO HARD! If you play this game, your friends will think you're way radder than you actually are. It's almost like you're lying to them. How does that feel?
126	1	a	Imagine yourself falling.  A rush of speed, that weightless sensation, the adoring fans watching from the floating buildings... Pretty awesome right? Now imagine hitting the ground! No, no, you didn't die. Instead you are graded on your performance at falling. I'm sure ya did pretty well!  Now imagine yourself buying this. Then buy it. Cause it's awesome. So yea.  'And I'm free, free fallin' Yeah, I'm free, free fallin'' - Tom Petty
128	1	a	A great game fore those who like to throw themselves off of buildings.
130	1	a	Ok at first I only bought this game for the Steam Treasure Hunt thing lol. But after playing it to get the achievement for the Treasure Hunt I have to admit that I kinda wanted to play it some more! XD
58	0	a	Meh. Potato hunting ruined this game for me, but you may enjoy it.
132	1	a	A great and hectic arcade skydiving game filled with Dejobaan's goofy charm.
134	1	a	I bought this for summer achievements a really long time ago. I got a portal 2 item out of it and a pretty cool game so I guess I'm okay with this.
136	1	a	This game deserves your hugs and kisses!
59	0	a	Just not my thing. I'll elaborate in that it becomes ridiculously repetitive, and don't spout the 'well all games are like that,' when its nothing but jump off the building and do xyz on the way down. Coupled with the fact that the exact same game was released with more levels under a different name, I can definitely not recommend this game.
138	1	a	Very different and innovative, while building on a simple concept. You may not enjoy actually playing it very much, however (like myself), but the only way to find out is by playing it.
140	1	a	One of the best Indie games to ever have been made, if not THE best... A ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of stuff to unlock, a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of hours to complete, and then you shall try and beat the records and the five star ratings on the levels. And ad to that the sucking feeling you get in your gut on many levels. It is in other words a brilliant game and you NEED to give it a chance.
60	0	a	A dropping/dodge buildings game.   As you fall you must move out of the way of the buildings while collecting various items. Not much to this game but is extremely difficult due to the amount of effort required to move. Taking cures from gravity and such, pushing in one direction will slowly move you that way. The longer you push the faster you will move and the longer it takes to stop or change directions. Game mechanics work well if you know that you just cannot move around like other dodge games.   Other than that, there is nothing more to this game.
61	0	a	Headache guaranteed
142	1	a	Falling with style
144	1	a	Fun game, low cost.
146	1	a	Basejumping for casuals.
148	1	a	Plummeting from thousands of feet above the Earth, the city above, a web of dark concrete and neon walkways, I found nirvana, which I proceeded to paint, along with most of my bodily humors, down the side of a mountain I had hugged a little too enthusiastically. Ten outta ten would break all of my bones again.
150	1	a	An arcade-type game where you fall wtih style. This game will last you as long as your imagination does on the topic of falling, whether that be good or bad.
152	1	a	super high quality good game lots of laughs and entertainment
154	1	a	Falling to your death has never been so fun.
156	1	a	It was cheap, for one. I was in an indie rage at the time, for two. For three, it has a really fluid feel to it for an indie game. Lastly, I really enjoy the generation X kinda feel the game exerts throughout, from the soundtrack to some of the design choices.
158	1	a	The 5th game from my library, Aaaaaaah, a reckless disregard for gravity. Again an old title, but fun to play  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIiIgFBid_8 
160	1	a	This was a simple game, and as such deserves a simple review. Reckless disregard was decent. Reminded me of racing games like trackmania where doing well comes down to having lighting fast reflexes. Would recommend, but not for the full price.  6/10
162	1	a	Ever wanted to jump off a building to skim past buildings, flip-off protesters, and graffiti walls on your way down? Then BUY THIS GAME! So fun, so original so zany in its humour: if you like incredible amounts of fun combined with trying something truly different, this game is for you.
164	1	a	Fun game, very fast-paced and gets really difficult later on. Get the newer version if you can.
166	1	a	thumbs up down....
168	1	a	It's like skydiving through an acid trip
170	1	a	A Millenium Falcon simulator with a great sense of humor.
172	1	a	Simple fun. Get a rush and a bit of smirk everytime I play.
174	1	a	This game kicks ♥♥♥. It has a very strange Jet Set Radio-like aesthetic, and it's very intense. If you like action games, this is a must-play. It's hard to describe, as base jumping isn't exactly a well-established video game genre, but it's very fun. Give it a shot, you won't be sorry.
176	1	a	This game is amazing and hilarious.
178	1	a	This is sheer lunacy but great fun. Jump from the upper atmosphere, trying to fly next to buildings as close as possible without becoming a lump of indistinguishable flesh. Slick presentation for an indie outfit with heaps of character.
180	1	a	Slam person through cyberspace, free prize inside!
64	0	a	8.99€ for this crap? WHAaHAaHAA - A Senseless Waste of Money.
182	1	a	LIKE PLUMETING THROUGH FLOATING BUILDING TOWARDS A RATHER BIG BLACK PLATFORM WHERE YOU CAN SLOW YOURSELF TO A LANDING WITH GOGO GADGET HELICOPTER!? NO? WELL BUY THIS GAME ANYWAY!
184	1	a	You throw yourself off buildings and flip off protestors whilst doing so. What more do I have to say? ♥♥♥♥ gravity.
186	1	a	Not for the faint of heart, or those who get vertigo easily XD The more I play this game, the better I feel I get the controls and the more fun I have! It's definitely got the edge-of-your-seat factor: I found myself trying to lean my body into the turns! I've only got a couple of levels I've played, but I do recommend this title.
65	0	a	The game is quite repetitive and boring. Technically it is okay, and I understand the appeal of getting the highest score, but I just don't like it.
188	1	a	fast paced mayham
190	1	a	Great game. Easy to pick up but impossible to master.
192	1	a	It is whats on the package. Pretty fun mechanics and enough varity to keep things interesting.
194	1	a	The best suicide simulater out there. EVER
196	1	a	I like this indie game, real trippy, amusing and requires some skill. Beware of seizures. :)
198	1	a	I really can't explain why I love this game, but I've logged more hours on this one that any other in the Potato Sack...  MUST. STOP. PLAYING.  It's a relatively simple game, with siezure-inducing graphics but there's a sick/slick combination of soapy voice-over and subversive art direction that keeps me coming back.  MUST. STOP. PLAYING.  
200	1	a	This game is good for people that really enjoy the indie game genre. When you look at the title 'AaAaAA!!! - A Reckless Disregard for Gravity' they aren't kidding. This game has an amazing techno - trance/rave soundtrack that always keeps you on the tips of your toes. The fact that this game puts you in the shoes of a free faller is great, and this is by far one of the most classic and memorable indie type games ever!
202	1	a	ha, this game is awesome...and fricken hilarious
204	1	a	Vertical Burnout Don't shatter your skeleton Dive bomb all the birds
206	1	a	A huge digital adrenaline rush running on the sheer frictional energy generated from having its tongue planted firmly in its own cheek. A great premise, giggle-inducing writing, hypnotic visuals and some pretty great music adds up to a really awesome experience. A definite must-play for fans of arcade gaming, skydiving, and the sound that the human body generates when it collides with a building at terminal velocity.
208	1	a	It feels like a cheap iphone game that was ported to the pc. I got it in a humble bundle.  Its okay. Bouncing off buildings as you fall can be fun I suppose. Best described as a quick time waster when you have absolutist nothing to do. You will need a decent computer to play for some reason. The speed of the game can be difficult for older computers to play.
210	1	a	My Rating: 3 out of 4 Replayability: YES Achievements: 7 Multiplayer: No  What is this game about?   This is a base jumping simulator where players earn points for performing tricks across eighty unique levels. There are seven achievements with their own varying difficulty to attain. The only involvement with other players is the leaderboard. Storyline is told through in the level selection by the stoner radio host. In the level selection there are options you can choose that either tell you facts or show acid-trip cinematics with odd stories.  Is it fun?   Yes, the game will keep you busy for hours, but doing the same tricks on various layouts of levels will get old.   
212	1	a	addicting.
68	0	a	AaAaAA!!! isn't necessarily a bad game it's just very mediocre beyond its initial presentation. There's nothing that motivates me to continue and that is enough for me to not recommend it.
214	1	a	Very cool indie game. Well executed fast paced design with a good dose of humor.
216	1	a	At first, this game plays as a cool indie game. Gradually, you get introduced to paragliding. It's a pretty awesome concept, and the gameplay is refreshing. Most levels have replay value. I highly recommend playing this in between hardcore gaming modes.
218	1	a	Lots of fun! Harder than you might think at first glance.
220	1	a	Freefalling taken to the extreme. Crazy cool, arcade-style gameplay that gives you just enough things to pay attention to and a sense of humor that is in a class of its own. Definitely a great first-person... faller.
222	1	a	This a great game with some funny humor and it will keep you entertained whenever you are bored. Best in short bursts of gameplay.
224	1	a	It satisfies my love of quirkiness, originality, and being trolled by a game.
226	1	a	Eh. I wouldn't recommend buying. Kinda a waste of money. Real disappointment. This game had the ingredients to be a great game but it was ♥♥♥♥ed over by the developers.
228	1	a	Drop in, Jump down, have fun. There isn't much more to say. A very simple gameplay and  funny ideas make this game very good.
230	1	a	Who would have thought skydiving could be packed with fun? Simple concepts, brilliant execution. One of the best indie games I've ever play.
232	1	a	The title's long and it looks wierd (or cheap—so much Impact), but I've had a lot of fun falling past buildings, flipping off observers, smashing through glass plates, and stitching between air-car traffic in 'AaAaAA!!!' This game puts me on the edge of my seat often, leaning in sympathy with my free-falling player character.  Cheap thrills—in a positive sense.
234	1	a	Imagin skydiving in the future.
236	1	a	This game is far more fun than I expected. There is something incredible about throwing yourself off a floating structure to sky-dive past other, somewhat more dangerous structures. Add to this a semi-dry wit and pervasive humour and you've got gold. Unique and challenging gameplay, entertainment throughout.
238	1	a	With it's Easy to learn Hard to master controls and reckless speed, 'AaAaAA!!!- A reckless disregard for gravity delivers a fast paced, enjoyable experiance, that makes me want to play the same level over and over again. The music is excllent for the game and it's style, being both fast pace and enegeritic. Whether i'm screaming over mountians at what feels like Mach 2, or tagging buildings and flipping off protesters on an urban skysprawl, 'AaAaAA!!! - A reckless disregard for gravity delivers a fun and high speed experince.
240	1	a	Suprisingly sexy little game that combines falling, towerblocks and the kind of sense of humour I can jive with.
70	0	a	Fun concept, rather serious lack of gameplay. Maybe the sequels fix this, but I don't feel like buying them.
242	1	a	This quirky and 'meemish' experience, AAAAAAAAAAA is one of the most original indie games I have ever played. This unique take on the classic platforming genre will have you hooked from your first jump. (Don't forget to stroke your lucky mouse ;) )  
244	1	a	why are there two of this game
246	1	a	This is a great game unless you have acrophobia I guess
248	1	a	IN THE YEAR OF OUR LORD TWENTY ELEVEN, YOU CANNOT LOOK UP FROM BENEATH A CITY AND SEE THE STARS  BUT YOU CAN LOOK DOWN FROM ABOVE IT  AND YOU CAN JUMP.
250	1	a	It's a good idea, if simultaneously a bit basic and a bit too flashy in its presentation. I have no problems with the existence of this game. But after half an hour of it I can see I'm not really hooked.
252	1	a	Lots of screaming, lots of fun.
254	1	a	Amazing humour, best played with a joystick and mouse, and in 3D!
256	1	a	Interesting title that's worth checking out. Did not expect to enjoy it as much as I did. It's also great for score chasing and the set challanges are just difficult enough to keep you going. Take a leap of faith, and try AaAaAA!!! - A Reckless Disregard for Gravity today! (See what I did there?)
258	1	a	You fall off things and touch things and say hi to your friends and then not die. T0 TH3 XTREEEEEM!!!!!EEEEE!A AAAAA AYEEAAAAAHH!!!!!!!  THIS ISNT YOUR GRADNMOTHERS ALLING SIMULATOR THIS IS AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!! BUY IT OR GO TO HELL!!!!!!!TO THE XXXTREM!E!!!
260	1	a	You Purchase The Game After Reading This, And Fall A Whole Lot In An Almost Graceful Manner.
262	1	a	Forever at the front of alphabatized gaming lists, AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA! has no genre. It's radically different from most games, even other indie titles, and plays its individuality well-enough to actually be a good game. At times, the game feels a bit repetitive, but that's negated by it letting you SKYDIVE FROM FLOATING SKYSCRAPERS. This game induces adrenaline rushes at times, which is far more than can be said for a lot of games bar intense multiplayer games. Give aaAaAA a shot, even if you don't like it, you'll never experience a game that tries to do what it succeeds in doing.
264	1	a	This is deffinatly a favorite of mine. Its high paced and filled with laughs. i have a feeling the person who made this happens to be quite the troll with a random personality. And I love that. So please give this game a chance. And remember to spay and neuter your whales.
266	1	a	This is a good video entertainment product.
268	1	a	Love this crazy game. Played it a while ago and finally bought it last week when it went on sale. Random insanity abound.
270	1	a	Good clean fun, full of weirdness. Simple to pick up, hard to master, the way games should be.
72	0	a	This is a really goofy game, with very... interesting humor. I thought it was pretty funny, at least.  Basically, you jump off of a floating building, and try to get as many points as possible as you weave between buildings and through point squares. The game is an interesting balance of risk vs. reward... you get lots of points by doing one of several possible risky maneuvers, but doing them might send you to an untimely death.  The idea is cool, but I got tired of it pretty quickly. Once I explored most of the levels, I really never felt like revisiting this game. I picked it up on sale for $2, and it was defintiely worth it for that price, but I couldn't recommend it at its full price of $10.
272	1	a	This games not that bad.....if your really bored.
274	1	a	A high-octane but also laid-back quirky title, you definitely won't be disappointed. Maybe a little frustrated, but never disappointed :)
276	1	a	This game is basically Trials HD except you're jumping from buildings and falling through the sky instead of driving a bike. Ridiculously addictive, ridiculously fun and ridiculously good music. It's an absolutely blast and it only costs a few bob, definitely grab it if you love chasing high scores.
278	1	a	Good fun in short sessions and certainly great fun for the price, AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! will test your dexterity in executing daring manoeuvres to net as many points as possible, more often than not bringing yourself within an inch of your life. With all the obstacles to consider, you might find yourself leaving it a little too late to deploy that parachute if you're not careful.  The sense of humor in this game can be downright cryptic and random.
280	1	a	This game is amazingly addictive! play this and you will be absorbed by flashing lights, colours and things for hours! Reccomend this game for people who like skydiving &gt;.&gt; who want a bit of fun (there is a lot of jokes!!) and much more
282	1	a	Very surprising and fun indy game! Jump off buildings and fall dangerously close to things on your way down. Stick the landing and rack up teeth as points...  Good times.
284	1	a	I love the humor in this game, and I lucked out, getting it on sale. Excellent little gem. Now I understand why it was featured during one of PAX2010's Indie Games panels.
286	1	a	I hate this game so much.
288	1	a	fun but missing some aspect to keep you drawn in(story, actual character, any type of customization) possibly some DLC is needed and i would definetely spend alot of time working at this game
290	1	a	How is this not more popular?? So much fun, full of great humor, the visuals and music are really good, and the mechanics are nicely done. You think falling to the ground would get old, but it doesn't. A hearty recommendation.
292	1	a	They made a game about falling with style. The idea is simple, jump off a building and grab as many points as you can before pulling the chute. Unlike many games now that give you trivial goals to win, this game demands that you take the most exciting and dangerous route to the bottom. You won't get anywhere by taking the easy way out, you have to earn those five star ratings. Falling through the air is very fun, many levels are amazingly hectic, and getting five stars for a perfect fall after struggling through a challenge is extremely rewarding. I've had a ton of fun with this game.
294	1	a	Easily one of the best games on Steam
296	1	a	Post-humor as ♥♥♥♥. Buy this game.
298	1	a	Despite me bad mouthing this game on the forams I went ahead and 3+ starred most of the levels and actually qutie enjoyed. It's annoyingly difficult to 5 star everything but I was happy enough with that.  I'm sure you've seen something about this game on the interwebs. You fall and get as close to buildings as you can, hit scoring plates, sprayaint buildings, wave to spectators, insert mechanic etc.   All that and the developer's strange sense of humour all builds to something which is pretty engaging if a little repetitive.
300	1	a	This is a delightfully absurd game. When I really get in the groove it is great to zoom past buildings getting close without hitting them. The game revels in its own strange world. If you don't already own this, I suggest getting AaAaAA for the Awesome, which contains this game, more levels and VR support.
302	1	a	The name is dumb but the game is a lot of fun. Who knew a free falling game could be so much fun.
304	1	a	Awesome experience in twitch gaming. The creativity in level design and the variety of gameplay dynamics is astounding. Really intense and fun game.
306	1	a	This fast-paced game will keep you on the edge of your seats and your eyeballs screaming for moisture. In this game, you are basically free falling from the sky, down towards a small landing pad in which the journey from point A to B is littered with obstacles that you must maneuver to obtain massive points by scoring tricks.  Controls are a little tough since even the slightest movements will crash you into the side of a building or you'll end up faceplanting some random obstacle at terminal velocity. There are plenty of levels and challenges to do so this game should keep you occupied for awhile. I'd say the difficulty of this game is up there and frustration is inevitable for certain challenges. Overall though, decent game to have. Grab it when on sale.
308	1	a	Jump from floating buildings and obtain points by going through rings, hoops, glass panes, etc. Collect teeth to unlock more levels and upgrades. Make sure you don't open your parachute too late or too early.
310	1	a	There is something unholy fun about diving through crazy floating cities, smashing through glass plates, and flipping off the haters. It's just... amazing when you dive through a gap, swing way off to the side, then back to bank some points, then plunge through another gap under acceleration, and pull it off flawlessly. Try it sometime.
312	1	a	6.5/10  A trippy game about Sky Diving. Decent time killer. You will have a slight panic attack since you're always moving forward and have to avoid walls and ledges. Would love the oculus with this lol.
314	1	a	Although the premise is simple, AAa is a game that I continue to return to for it's exciting and gratifying gameplay.
316	1	a	Falling through the air, getting kisses and hugs, thumbs up and middle finger all wrapped up in an addictive game. The music is perfect for the game, the offbeat sense of humour works. After all that, look at the price! WHY HAVEN'T YOU BOUGHT THIS YET?!
318	1	a	AaAaAAAaAaAAAaAaAA!!  playing this game made me throw up on my seizure, while I ran around my desk in circles  11/10 would recommend again  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
320	1	a	Fun game, low price :)
322	1	a	A fun game to play if you've got some time to waste, or if you want a change of pace. The game can get pretty intense in the later levels, as you swerve between buildings trying to stay close enough to score points but keep enough distance not to spin out and/or get killed. Though trying to get 5 stars on a level can get frustrating sometimes, if you don't know how you can improve your run. Fun, addictive, and different. Worth the money, especially when it's on sale.
324	1	a	This game is awesome, you jump off of a rooftop and have to look cool on the way down.
326	1	a	Awesome, adicting, funny indie game. I highly recommed this one.
328	1	a	A skydiver's dream game. Base jumping with points. Easy to learn and controls are straight forward using WSAD. You're given a first person view of falIing. As you fall you're able to guide yourself through point panels... through tunnels... building structures... and then you reach bottom and you must parachute into a large circle to complete the jump.   The jumps get progressively harder as you can imagine, and having a wide screen monitor or running Steam in 'big picture' mode on your wide screen TV almost makes for some virtual reality feel to the game. I wouldn't mind seeing a multiplayer mode for this game... or coop with both players competing for the points on the jumps. Nice game... on sale.
330	1	a	Skydiving through neon lights, birds, colored glass panels, tagging floating buildings, cheering or flipping off spectators and protestors, all while attempting to avoid becoming a pile of broken bones. Flashy-yet-simple, engaging, tight play controls, and good music all wrapped up in bizarre sense of humor the likes of which Douglas Adams or Monty Python could appreciate. Try it. That pig isn't going to de-bristle itself!
332	1	a	Fun but not spectacular. Could use some environmental variety.
74	0	a	Good minigame to pick up and play. Load up and get into a game super fast. Doesnt require too much focus. Good to play in the background whilst playing music or talking. Overall not amazing but decent.   3/10
334	1	a	This recommendation is especially for those who frequent /r/trees. As someone who has sky dived and has no fear of heights I can honestly say that this game does a fantastic job of replicating the feeling of falling. You can almost feel the wind or your cheeks and a sensation of breakneck speeds are guaranteed. Fall for this game, I did!
336	1	a	There is not much to say about the game. It's a well-meaning little arcade experience. The mechanics are simplistic, the graphics likewise and the sound design is passable. I would normally pass off such a game as mediocre, and yet somehow it all comes together in an engaging and compelling manner. It's not the sort of game you'd spend hours upon hours playing, but it's a nice diversion from time to time.
338	1	a	Base Jumping....without the risk of death, decently fun game if you can get it on the cheap.
340	1	a	Quite intense indy game. Get it f it's cheap.
342	1	a	i love the letter a and this just has them
344	1	a	A simple but brilliant game that has kept me coming back again and again when I'm looking to waste a little time. The whole 'extreme sport' theme of diving off floating buildings and performing stunts on your vertical trip would have been plenty, but the game also has a very unique sense of humor that adds volumes to the experience. If you want an example, just look at the names of their achievements.
346	1	a	This game is positively evil. It wants you to fail, it wants to eat your children, it hates you. It is one of the most addictive and compelling games you'll ever play. Get it or I will find you and eat your bread!
348	1	a	One idea:  Skydiving is fun. Excellent execution. ♥♥♥♥♥
350	1	a	Cyberspace basejumping, what else ?
352	1	a	It's ♥♥♥♥ flamethrowers meets zombie strippers with their ♥♥♥♥ out. Thats how balls awsome this game is.
354	1	a	The jumps you make are not about rationalization. They are about a reckless disregard for traditional gameplay.
356	1	a	Addicting score attack. High score, high speed adrenaline. It's a fun game with tons of content too,
358	1	a	Great time killer. Plus Achievements.
360	1	a	Original and fun. If you want to buy a game and not sure what to get... then get this!
362	1	a	Played for one hour to get 22600 points in the 'Mash Face Against Mountain' level. Interesting concept, might play it again some day. It takes a while to figure out the controls and mechanics. The graphics aren't that excellent but they do their job.
81	0	a	I bought this game 7 years ago when it first came out; and I think it is pretty telling that in that time I have not even touched it once after the first few hours.
364	1	a	Good game to waste a bit of time. Didn't engage me for too long, though. I probably wouldn't pick up any of the extra levels. It is worth the money if you get it on sale.
366	1	a	While simplistic I find that this game is increadbly fun. The continus movement combined with controls to deface buildings and gesture to NPCs provides a satisfying reward loop.
368	1	a	The game is fun and unique. It's not super fulfilling and most of the stages are basically the same thing. That being said you'll probably play it for a couple of hours at least, if not more. The game is always on sale so don't pay more than 2.49 for it.
370	1	a	AaAaAA!!! Sky-diving and them some. Good game with a decient play-time. Get it if you can find it in b bundle.
83	0	a	Poop that will you an epileptic seizure.
372	1	a	IF you are prone to motion sickness or siezures you should run screaming from this game, but as long as you can stomach it this game is a real trip. In this game you have to fall through a floating city (blocks, walls, flying cars, and birds) earning points by getting close to stuff, flipping off protesters, etc. The game is very fast paced eclectic fun and I love every minute of it.
84	0	a	AaAaAA!!!-- A Reckless Regard for Sanity
374	1	a	When I first started the game up, I was very sceptical of it. Everything from the name, the intro screen to the actual gameplay struck me as cheap and plain bad. I went through a few levels, the whole time thinking 'What the ♥♥♥♥ am I doing?' and quit.  I decided to jump back into the game again after I felt pretty bored. I started seeing a pattern, and I was actually enjoying the randomness of it all. I understood what hugs, kisses, thumbs ups and obscenities did. I was just dumbfounded when I saw that I got 2000 Teeth after a level, but then I figured out it's just basically points in order to unlock other levels. After that, I started getting a lot more into it.  I passed most of the normal levels, when I noticed a button at the bottom of the screen, titled 'Awesome!!!'. So, I clicked on it, and another full page of levels popped up. The same as the regular ones, but here you unlock them by getting knees instead of teeth. Except, these ones were...  pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ intense . Compared to the first levels, here you were falling at supersonic speeds, straining hard to concentrate on the mess of colors, patterns, beeps and clicks as you flew past the actually beautiful world. At first I thought it was a dumb game, very relaxed and easy, but boy, some of these levels are   tough!  . I found myself more dedicated to passing a level than in any other game I've ever played, and I kept going for more!  Overall, at first glance the game seems very bland and stupid and random. But it slowly starts taking up shape in your mind, making more and more sense. The real fun starts when you get good enough to start the 'Awesome!!!' level pack, because some of the levels nearly caused adrenaline to seep out of my skin.  I'd give this game a very strong 9/10, because it does take a bit of time to get used to the weirdness of it. But, trust me, once you get a bit more into it, the game really shines, and is insanely fun.
85	0	a	Fun for a little while, but ultimately repetitive, shallow, and headache-inducing. Not as funny as it thinks it is, either. Worth a try as part of a bundle, but not something I would recommend for direct purchase.
376	1	a	My nomination for 'Best use of gravity' in the 2016 Steam Awards ;) This is a light-hearted quick-action title where risk meets reward as you base jump through a floating city, maneuvering through terraces and around buildings while trying to accumulate points.   I think the developers did a wonderful job with this title.  I suggest picking this game up when it goes on sale(for ~$2 or ~$3) as it is easily worth a night's great entertainment, especially when you or your friend are drunk off your ♥♥♥.
378	1	a	This game can be summed up in one phrase - butt clenching base jumping simulator. It ticks several boxes:  [x] Tons of levels [x] Blood pumping music [x] Weird as hell tapes that are genuinely disturbing [x] Diverse stages with pretty graphics [x] Clever mechanics to keep the gameplay fun and not repetitive  So if you want to play a good time wasting, arcady game, I'd recommend this.  
380	1	a	Awesome game, PLENTY of content, and an enjoyable new concept that offers high speed adrenal action! Highly recommended for anyone looking to try something different from your typical video game.
382	1	a	Ever look over the edge of a tall building and hear that voice in the back of your head tell you '... jump...'?  This game seems like it's entire concept was constructed from that very principle, often called 'Lapelle Du Vide' or 'Call of the void' though with a comical twist to the whole idea. The goal is simple, jump from a VERY high altitude (some go as far as space), come close enough to buildings and objects that you 'kiss' or 'hug' them without suffering the ill effects of free-fall collision, and try to land safely. BTW, instead of earning coins or something, the main currency you use to unlock new levels is 'teeth'... I don't know why but it makes me just uneasy enough that I laugh every time I finish a level and it sais 'You've earned X number of teeth!'  For those with vertigo or who have a fear of hights/falling, I don't reccomend this game as you'll probably find yourself reaching for a bucket every level. To everyone else, I absolutely reccomend this game.
384	1	a	Once I played the original version of this, I knew that Dejobaan are the chaotic neutral mad scientists of indie gaming (and that I love them for it). Frantic gameplay that requires that you plan things in order to get the best score, and some surprisingly well-done world building for such a relatively plotless piece (on top of the massive amount of stages for such a price). Overall, I'd recommend it, and it's my favorite Dejobaan game to date (with Drunken Robot Pornography being a close second).
386	1	a	Here is all the FAQ you need to know if you want to buy this game.   Q: Is that game good? A: well that depends, can you handle a game that literally takes your logic and then ♥♥♥♥♥ all over it just to then light on fire and use as warmth during the middle of the day when its 90 degrees out and the planet is quickly hurtling towards the sun to be disintegrated after which the sun blows up and out comes this game wearing your logic as a baby bib and your mental sanity as a diaper.  if so then you will love this game.
388	1	a	Holy crap. This game is super awesome. It's frustrating as hell--but it's one of those games where you don't mind dying 62 times on the same level, because it's just so damn fun. It's exhilarating and invigorating in a way that I forgot video/computer games could be.  I don't know if anyone else had/will have the same experience I had, but on the off chance that it will help: Take the time to tweak the controls and settings. I wasn't crazy about the game until I played the tutorials several times with different settings to find what I liked. Once you hit the sweet spot, this game is like candy. Sweet, terminal velocity candy.  Highly recommended. 9/10.
390	1	a	This game isn't for me and I don't think I'll play it much, but I think a lot of people would enjoy it.  The concept is that you're freefalling (BASE jumping) and you have to weave between buildings and platforms, falling as close to the walls as possible without touching them, to accrue maximum points. You also get to smash through score pads, gesture at fans, paint tag, and other such stuff. Then you need to nail the landing in a tight spot, deploying your parachute at just the right time to not break your bones.  The skill in the game is to know which weaving path to take as you fall in order to maximise your points and be able to spend them on unlocking further levels. Which group of buildings has the longest walls, which score pads are the most valuable, which landing pad to aim for, etc.  I would have liked the movement to be a little more responsive, but I understand that would defeat the purpose of the game.  As usual with Dejobaan games, the music is a lot of fun and the game is imbued with a witty edgy mood.  Playable with a controller, and that might be the better way to play it.
392	1	a	Yes. This is simultaneously a videogame, a video game, a vidja, and true art. It is beyond the Citizen Kane of videogames. It is the antibiotics of videojames.  tldr; falling down is fun.
394	1	a	An interesting game in which your ability to fall from great heights is put the the ultimate test. Fun for a few hours, I'm not sure if I'd be able to beat all the levels even if I wanted too. Great game if you get it cheap.
89	0	a	Weird, quite hard to control.
396	1	a	Nice game. What you do is practically jump off the buildings and do some stunts. Controls take time getting used to but when you get used to them the game becomes very fun. You probably wont play for 2-3 hours nonstop but its really fun for the 20-30 min you will usually play. Oh and an important note if you are afraid of heights this game is not for you as what you literally do in the game is jump off buildings and mountains etc. :)
398	1	a	Got hit by a flying car while paragliding and eating Chipotle in my right hand  10/10
400	1	a	really really really... AWESOME! 10/10
402	1	a	This is one of the best games I've ever played, one which is extremely underrated. The physics, the action, the features, the graphics, the gameplay, every single thing is just perfect. It's just amazing. On a scale of 1 to 10, I'd give it 9. It's a must-have.
404	1	a	I'm now convinced I could skydive like a professional through Dubai without a any safty equipment or permits. 15/10
406	1	a	'I really like the game, but I couldn’t find the stupid cake.'
408	1	a	Fun arcade-style game with tight mechanics and a lot of humor.
410	1	a	This game made me break my legs. And possibly my skull.
412	1	a	A wonderfully crafted expansion(?) for the original 'AAaaaAAaAA!' title. New levels, updated graphics, great soundtrack...  You'll be fracturing your legs and breaking your pelvis in twain for teeth all over again. And you'll love every single second of it.
414	1	a	AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! for the Awesome is a fun game, with a ridiculous amount of content. Slowly, the game introduces new mechanics, and makes every level feel unique, with over 120 levels I still didn't get bored. The game has a great  soundtrack  to go with the fast paced gameplay. It is pure joy to play this game! For me, the last levels were the most fun I had, the most difficult, and yet the most enjoyable.
416	1	a	Not bad for an indie game. Its basically jumping off buildings and getting more points for the risker stuff you do. Didn't mind it but not really my cup of tea.
418	1	a	A couple hours of good entertainment. I don't have the patience to go back and try to get more points to unlock some of the final levels, but I had fun with it.
420	1	a	This game taught me how to hug and kiss my monitor, jump out of my window and survive    ~10/10 Will jump again
422	1	a	Great game. Especially if you have 20 minutes or so for playing. Good for those people who like dreaming that they're falling. Couple of friends got goosebums watching me play this. Definetely an AAAAaaaaaaAAAAwesome game!!!!1one
95	0	a	Too much repetitive. May be a good experience for those who like flying and speed, though.  3/10
424	1	a	Never before have I had more fun with a suicide simulator.
426	1	a	Second verse, same as the first. Although the aesthetic suffers a bit, and it feels like much of the same otherwise, it's still a solid game concept. If you liked the first one you'll like this one too. It's the same thing.
428	1	a	This game, on the DK2, is like flying around the matrix, it's awesome fun. A huge rush in a few levels in.
430	1	a	The best dystopian-future themed base-jumping simulator ever created. Easy enough for anyone to pick up and play a few rounds, deep enough to keep score-attackers more than satisfied. Definitely a 10/10
432	1	a	I'm kinda divided with this game. If NOW you only want to play a game for a little, than it's awesome NOW. But if NOW you want a game to play for a long time, than this game is not for you NOW. I would rate 7/10. But i still recomend it. And also, Alex is nude. AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!!
434	1	a	Crazy base jumping that requires skill, not just luck. Not easy either, a real challenge.
99	0	a	This game gives me a great amount of motion sickness. If movement of any kind bothers you. Dont buy this game
436	1	a	One of my favorite games. it takes a bit getting used to, but once you get it, it's a blast. The game is a fast paced, free falling game, that has some intesne rage. I wish I had a VR, because this game would be amazing with that.
438	1	a	Really awesome and fun game where the player freefalls through an obstacle course and attempts to rack up as high a score as possible. Gain points by getting close to buildings, gesturing at spectators, and various other stunts. The highest scoring paths are usually the most risky, so be careful not to crash and die :) This is one of those concepts that is easy to learn, but difficult to master. There are endless hours of fun, trying to get high scores on over 100 maps. Graphics are simple but effective, and the music adds to the intensity. The low purchase price is great value for money.
440	1	a	It takes a short while to get used to but this score-attack game absolutely clicked with me. The game really comes into its own once you have got competent at all the basics and played most of the basic mode levels then charge in to the 'awesome' mode which is much faster and honestly even more fun. Just like in real life, hugs and kisses are very moreish, and in the week I've been playing it I keep wanting to come back to it for about an hour at a time. Plus I keep getting amusing chat reactions to 'Gagaman is currently playing AaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!!' which is a bonus.
442	1	a	Strangely fun base jumping game. Offers everything the original has. Maps have multiple paths so it is up to you to figure out how to score the most points.
444	1	a	Epicly fantastic on the Oculus Rift DK2!
103	0	a	Come on, 10 bucks for this crap?!!?
104	0	a	Really not worth 10 bucks, it's a game you'll play for like five minutes then forget about. Also it tries really hard to be funny but it's not at all  Like seriously the 'humor' is pretty cringe inducing And the menus my god they're horrid
105	0	a	AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! for why the hell am I still playing this game.
106	0	a	  Gets game in Humble Bundle: waits a year to try it.     Takes longer to install than to get bored of.    Simply, the game is just repetitive and not that fun. It feels oddly slow for a game where you freefall, and it's not satisfying to play. Nothing about this game is special; it feels like they just ripped off the skydiving from Pilotwings and tried to make it their own. The difference is that Pilotwings is a better game.   
107	0	a	I got a bit of motion sickness. Cannot really play it, and this is the first time i have felt that in a game. Beware of it. Maybe you do not have it however.
108	0	a	Not sure what I expected from this game, but it is definitely not something I enjoyed.
109	0	a	Interesting idea for a game but it gets boring pretty fast. You fall fairly slowly so it really isn't too exciting. I like the sense of humor in the game but it's not enough to keep my attention.
446	1	a	This game. This game... it's amazing. Fast paced, fun, great music, and somehow incredibly immersive. I recommend it. I didn't try it with Oculus Rift, but I imagine it being out of this world. It's worth the money, and it's also on the Humble Bundle right now. 3 days left, go go go!
111	0	a	Pretty rubbish game, there are honestly better facebook games.
448	1	a	was able to flip the bird to some red people, these guys really need to work on diversity in their games
450	1	a	Not a game to be taken seriously. But it's MASSIVE fun.
452	1	a	More like AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! for the Alright.
113	0	a	I liked the idea, and it's a little funny, but it's not very fun. The controls frustrated me and instead of feeling moved to get better, I felt moved to quit playing, and that's what I did after not too long.
454	1	a	Insanely fun cool down game!
456	1	a	This game makes me want to parachute like that guy that jumped out of a rocketship for Red Bull. Also, this game has an awesome name.
458	1	a	The good:  -VR supported (for better experience); -Controler supported; -Achievements; -Originality; -Level quantity; -Fitting soundtrack; -Leaderboards.  The bad:  -Repetitive; -Controls; -Optimization; -UI;  Score: 6/10.
460	1	a	Play it while you are high.  420/10
462	1	a	Jump off impossibly tall and floating buildings, plummet, dodge stuff, flip the bird, dodge more stuff, land.  Get paid in teeth, knees and quite possibly other body parts...
117	0	a	It doesnt have any point other than wasting time
118	0	a	OMG does this game suck. Tutorials don't let you actually DO anything (they're VIDEOS!), and control of movement when you pop your 'chute isn't explained at all ('turn with the mouse' it says - to ZERO effect!). I wasted nearly no money on this, but it was still a waste.
119	0	a	It's ok.
464	1	a	I can't tell you how much fun it is to jump off a building(?) and 'base-fly' jump. The speeds are well executed by the game It all seems very realistic, and no broken bones. I am terrified of heights and this was a big shock, so if you are also, get ready for some fun if you can stand taking that first step off.
466	1	a	The semi sequel to a reckless disregard for gravity, it is faster, more attractive, and amazing. If you enjoyed the first one, you will go ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ for the new content in this one.
468	1	a	games pretty fun and challengeing , only thing you should be warned about is if you use a gamepad for this. it works fine and everything but there is apparently no deadzone for it in this game which can get annoying at times. other then that id say go for it
470	1	a	amazing game, if you love falling through something that feals like the internet, then get this game. YOU NEED TO PLAY IT!
472	1	a	I actually got the new updated version recently, but I've been playing the original for quite some time now. It's probably the only game that's never been uninstalled from my computer at any point in time. It's my 'zen' game; I play it to zone out as the game itself is simple and easy to focus on.
474	1	a	This is like the first game but with faster jumps and better environments. If you liked the first one, and you should, then you will dig this as well. Well worth the money for a truely unique experience.
476	1	a	Epic sequel for an epic game, excellent re-mastered graphics. This is a must-buy
478	1	a	The original game was a unique and fun game, which i would normally reccomend, but since this semi-sequel includes all the original levels, plus bonuses, for the awesome people out there. Go get it. 'tis good.
480	1	a	Good concept but gave me a little vertigo. I'd recommend using a controller for this one as the k/b / mouse combo felt a little off with this title.
482	1	a	Fun enough game for an hour or so to get the easy achievements, but I probably won't start it again. The rest of the achievements are just excessively tedious to get (not difficult, just takes a lot of time).
484	1	a	Fun to the extreme! No, yeah it's a great little game with lots and lots of levels and content. The music is great as well as the art style. Haven't tried it with the Oculus Rift yet but it's probably really exhilarating
486	1	a	there is no story  just alot of awesome music and base jumping goodness  i havent put alot of time into it but it is a game that i enjoy and if you see it for the right price or a humbe bundle pick it up  also the game has oculas support nuff said
488	1	a	I have put yes to recommending this, but beware, motion sickness. You don't know it while playing, but after you shut it down and go to bed, or whatever, I felt extremely sick, like projectile vomiting all over the room. But it's a pretty neat concept. If they added a kind of visual effect to simulate the speed of freefalling, it would of been even better. As it is, you kind of just float down.
490	1	a	AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! is a game about base-jumping and high-score chasing. Each of the game's levels start with you falling off a building suspended in mid-air, and plummeting to the ground below, smashing glass plates and skirting close to skyscrapers and other mid-air debris for 'kisses' and 'hugs', which translate into more points at the end of the level. If you crash, you're forced to start over from the beginning of the jump (or more rarely, a mid-level checkpoint). As you progress through the game, you're presented with more ways to score points, from waving to fans/flipping off angry protesters to marking anti-establishment graffiti on marked buildings. Once you reach the colored landing markers near the bottom of the level, you activate your propeller wings and land safely, hopefully langing in designated zones for yet more bonus points. All this is presented alongside odd, dystopian-flavored humor in the form of 'radio broadcasts' heard on the stage select screen. Aaaaa! For The Awesome, in addition to content from original title, also ships with additional levels where your character falls at twice the rate, for added challenge.  At the current asking price of $10, this game is definitely worth it if you ever enjoyed seeing how far you could fall without dying in World of Warcraft or similar, and wanted to compete with complete strangers on a coreboard to see who could do it the best. Even if you didn't want to do the latter part, it's still worth a run. Or, indeed, a jump.
492	1	a	Fear of heights Simulator 2013
494	1	a	Its fun for a short amount of time. It is really best suited to Tablets, to look down in to it. You probably wont play for more than 20 minutes at a time.
496	1	a	I recommended the original AaAaAA!!! way back when. This is mostly the same: All the old levels are still there, but remastered and accompanied by about half as many great new levels. No reason to get the original anymore, all the more reason to get this one.
498	1	a	A great stress relive thingy, with crazy ideas and surprisingly addictive action! And no old graphics will stop you from enjoying exploding music, weaving to your fans and kissing buildings. Because you just jumped from a mountain/skyscraper and are flying towards the ground on faster-then-light speed! aaaAaAAAAaaAAAaAAwesome!!!  Also, dem achievements, so golden! 
500	1	a	It's a remastered version of the first one with some new levels soooooo more base jumping.
502	1	a	Very good, and super addictive....but sometimes requires tighter controls than it has.
504	1	a	Picked this up as part of another bundle, but ended up being surprisingly fun in its own right.
506	1	a	Probably one of my favourite games of all time at first it appears to be just another indie game, so expecting a mediocre game that's only good for wasting the odd hour here and there  It's actually a supprisingly good game,  very simple, easy to get the hang of and not to mention extremely addictive, If you like your flashy graphics, and awesomely indepth storyline, this deffinitely isn't for you,  but if you just wanna waste your life away doing something utterly pointless but amazingly fun at the same time, this is deffinitely the way to go
508	1	a	Chilled out free failing game !  made me want to have an Oculus Rift.
510	1	a	Load up the rift version and prepare to be terrified about virtual base jumping. It took 5 minutes to 'jump' the first time.
512	1	a	Interesting concept. Fairly amazing at first, but it fades fast. I laughed and enjoyed the first 50 jumps. Therefore, I recommend it for a one nighter which I will probably return to now and then.
514	1	a	Just about the best falling games. Actual feeling of speed, addictive and challenging. Tons and tons and tons of levels. Devs are awesome too.
516	1	a	I have to be honest; I'm not a big fan from this game on computer. But I'm addicted on it on my phone, it makes so much fun there =)
518	1	a	Fantastic, unique title. The idea of the game is to simply jump off of a building, coming dangerously close to other buildings and obstacles without slamming into them. It's based in the future, with buildings reaching insane heights. Really fun. It's also on Android if you prefer to play via motion controls, but I find using a mouse works better.
520	1	a	It's a simple idea, just fall, but For the Awesome (I'm not writing the first bit) provides enough variety and well designed levels to keep it fun and interesting. I will say that the graphics feel a bit low-tech and generic, and I wouldn't mind a bit more depth, but the game is fun and packed with adrenaline, easily worth the $10 asking price, and a no brainer if you find it on sale.
522	1	a	'Gravity, thou art an ♥♥♥♥♥'  Fall, get score, that's about it really.
524	1	a	I'm not even about to include the name of this game in this review. Nope, not even copy-pasting it.  Base-jumping in a surreal setting can only become fun when the game-feel is right. Does it feeel like you're falling at 9.8 m/s^2? Does it feel like wind is blowing through your button on windbreaker pants? Does it feel like you're actually deploying and controlling a parachute down to your landing? Yes, yes, yes and no.   The game is reminiscent of sonic the hedgehog in a way, it's super fast and agile (movement wise), level based ,and very heavily emphasizes 'points'. The humor in the game is very smartass but in a way that feels like they're being a smartass with you rather than towards you, and its honestly one of the better parts of the game itself. The amount of variety in the levels as well as different routes through the levels give the game some solid replayability while you go back through and try to get higher scores on levels you've maybe passed up too fast. It is very hard to 5 star every level and so eventually, you will hit a brick wall where you can't finish buying all of the levels because you've run out of points and run out of levels to earn more points. It's really fun when you get into it, until it starts getting tedious. I could see this game being more fun with friends (actual friends in person, with a game controller, passing it around), but alone, I can only play in 10~15 minute bursts.  Overall: 6.5/10
121	0	a	Do you like douchy metal/punk rock music? Do you like terrible UI's? Do you like weird currency that hold no value in the game? If you answered yes to all of these then please buy this game and dont play it and get a life. The only true reason to ever play this game is to have a bit of practice in strafeing skills and falling physics. Absolutly awful no one with a brain would play this game.
122	0	a	Honestly, i've played this game once and i don't plan on returning. It's just weird, and i don't really now how i got it, either.
526	1	a	Scarred me for life.  10/10
528	1	a	I don't really know what to say about this, for me it was very addicting, like crack almost. The tone of the game was enoyable for the most part. I would give it around 7-8/10. The drawback I guess is no level creator. A level maker would increase the replayability of the game. pls do this.
125	0	a	This game is to hard...
126	0	a	I wouldn't reccomend that you buy this game
530	1	a	I can't tell you how much fun it is to jump off a building(?) and 'base-fly' jump. The speeds are well executed by the game It all seems very realistic, and no broken bones. I am terrified of heights and this was a big shock, so if you are also, get ready for some fun if you can stand taking that first step off.
532	1	a	This is a great casual game. In 20 seconds from the start, you're falling through some silly levels at much speed, flipping off haters and thumbs-upping the cheering fans on platforms that boom past you. This version has some nice pollish since the original 'reckless disregard for gravity', give it a try!
128	0	a	AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! - The sound one makes after buing it
534	1	a	Break a few laws in a virtual world and have lots of fun doing it! It's like GTA except not really and there is a lot more falling and (probably) breaking your neck/legs/arms/everything. There are a lot of levels to play and there are random entertaining videos that you can unlock in between all the falling. It's a dollar on the humble bundle at the moment, so what have you got to lose? (Besides a dollar).
129	0	a	Not a whole lot to this game. If it was free I'd say what the hell and give it a go, but I would not spend money on this game. Not recommended.
536	1	a	Biggest waste of money I've made. I dropped $20 on this game and it's god-awful. If I was given the opportunity to get a refund, I would not hesitate.
538	1	a	First things first, I absolutely love the music. I left the game up for 30 minutes, just to listen to the music. Maybe its just me, but I loved it. Second fact, this is your typical 'fall and avoid things in way' type game. That being said, the graphics are out of date, the controls are not very precise, and the features, are limited at best. That being said, it is perhaps the best money (I think I got it in a humble bundle, not sure) I have spent. I can't explain why it is, maybe its the constant humor that actually is funny, or the raw challenge, unlike other fall type games that has drawn me to this game.
131	0	a	This game makes me want to jump off a building IRL.
540	1	a	Really GOOD game i play this game every day
542	1	a	This is one of those games that is so funny/quirky that it's impossible to write a funny/quirky recommendation. Really all I can do is quote the game's intro:   'In the year of our Lord, nineteen eighty two, polystructures fell from space. Massive but light, they touched the atmosphere, and stuck.  Scientists made new materials. Builders made new cities. Families made their homes thousands of feet above ground level. Art made the floating super-sculptures, and culture made the floating caviar socials to regard them.  In the year of our Lord, twenty eleven, you cannot look up from beneath a city and see the stars.  But you can look down from above it. And you can jump.  The jumps you make are not about art. They are about a reckless disregard for safety.  The jumps you make are not about culture. They are about a reckless disregard for regulation.  The jumps you make are not about science. They are about a reckless disregard for gravity.'  And that's the least nutty part of the game.
544	1	a	Summer Gaming Project Review:  Second verse, same as the first!  4/5
546	1	a	This games reminds of some other falling purpose game, and i can honestly say a little more work has been done on this. but it still dindt live up to me sadly, you fall and fall and score points, and teeths and you use the teeths to purchase new maps (correct me if im wrong its been a long time since i played it=  6/10
548	1	a	Really weird and hilarious game, made by Dejobaan (making games for over 75 years!). They push you off a tower, and you get points for it. Tell them what you think. ;)   The humour is everywhere (as you complete levels, you gain teeth, which are in turn used to buy levels, the abilities you can use, and some joke videos (they're pretty inventive).  I'd advise anyone looking for something cheap and decent to go for it. The Awesome add-on adds some tougher levels to this, and expands the story (yes, there is a story of sorts).
550	1	a	This game might be a bit old now but still well worth playing! There is two things that strike me with the game, first is that i don't get that 'ops im falling' feeling i want and the second is that im having a hard time letting it go when i have started playing, that only one more try sets in instantly!  Want to watch us play it you can do it below!  http://youtu.be/ypoCl9v0cgA   The good - Music is awesome - The 'can't stop playing' syndrome  The bad - I suck at basejumping
552	1	a	They said I wouldn't get a cute girlfriend so I jumped off a skyscraper and started hugging and kissing buildings instead... 10/10 would hug&amp;kiss again.
554	1	a	The menus are silly and awesome. The game itself is awesome. Those perfectionists can have a blast while the people that just want to have fun can get 3-4 stars easily. I love games that are easy to play, and yet highly rewarding.
556	1	a	You touch my tralala
558	1	a	I have never had LSD, but I assume it is very much like this.
560	1	a	Look at the stairs !!! What ? AaaaaAAaaaAAAaAAAAaAAAAA!!!!
562	1	a	With the recently released patch, they've cleared up the few lingering issues holding this game back for the rift.  It's fun without the Rift, but it's definitely better with it now 
134	0	a	this is poop
564	1	a	Brilliant indie game all about base jumping! Set in a distopian future where some very large blocks have fallen out of the sky and remain suspended there, AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! for the Awesome is all about the subculture of jumpers, people who jump off these giant buildings in the sky.  AAAA--♥♥♥♥ it not typing that all again--is the first Aaaa game with a sizable expansion, more stable controls (slightly), and a slight graphics update. It is certainly a great game worth every penny.
566	1	a	Buy it! It's such a fun game! It's challenging, without me ragequitting alot! Get it now!
568	1	a	I love this game! It is very well optimised, even for my low power machine, running at quite an acceptable level on simple graphics. The mechanics and level design is amazing, adrenaline pumping twists and turns, bear hugs, invulns, speed-ups and slow-downs are all the new mechanics here. The little 'news strips' in the level selection screen is witty and makes me chuckle. And the music! The music is fantastic! There is one track that makes me feel like james bond, another that makes me feel like sonic. The flip it glove is always fun to use, and the graffiti mechanics are very fun, if not a bit difficult to get close enough to the building.   In short:   Pros:  +fantastic music + great optimisation + Linux! + witty storytelling + great level design  Cons:  - Graffiti mechanic hard to use - limited options - relatively steep learning curve - confusing level selection screen - at least for newbies  But still, i would definetly reccomend this for you or for any other person as a gift.
135	0	a	Gets old fast and there are many better rhytm based games. 6/10
136	0	a	I wish I could remove this game from my library.
570	1	a	Superfun. Get this one rather than the first, as this contains all the previous games levels. Quite addicting, great for passing time. Game is nice and unique, and is full of humor.
137	0	a	The tutorials do a very poor job of explaining the controls. The game is kind of fun, but very repetitive.
138	0	a	Meh. I feel like the title was only put in to make this game sit at the top for your steam library, because they are sorted in alphabetical order. If you want a cheap casual game to play, play a browser game instead.
572	1	a	Write a recommendation - Example: 'I really like the game, but I couldn’t find the stupid cake.' You can write a recommendation for any game you own.
139	0	a	The menus are HORRIBLE! Every single one of them, horrible. I don't know what's worse, the mechanics or the menus. Once you work out how to navigate the menus, you must search through tons of locked levels that aren't sorted at all in order to find the starter tutorial levels, mixed in with random facts that are just in the way of gameplay and clutter everything. The way the game was executed is too complicated for it's own good, despite the idea behind it (falling) should be simple.
574	1	a	ummm just dont know with this game
576	1	a	Skydiving at high velocity is pretty awesome indeed.
578	1	a	Skydiving with AWESOME AWEEEESSSOOOMMEEE soundtracks and very beautiful visuals.
580	1	a	Nice game for the rift dk2! Easy to play with an xbox controller
582	1	a	There is a quote (I believe by Sartre, though I won't swear to it) that goes something like this: We are afraid of heights not because we fear that we will fall, but because we fear we will throw ourselves over the edge.  AaaaaAA etc. for the Awesome is the embodiment of that quote.  The game is engaging, the physics fun, and surprisingly(frighteninglly?) engrossing. Though you will find yourself splattered across the pavement quite often, it's hard to feel like the game is punishing you for trying the tricky shots. Add to it the dark, quirky sense of humor (in-game text for hitting something at speed: 'Your femurs turned to femur paste!) and you get something fantastic.  In short: Little is as liberating as throwing yourself off of a building and flipping off haters on the way down.
584	1	a	The best hugging at extreme speeds simulator money can buy.
586	1	a	said your mother when i put my french bread in her basket
152	0	a	This game is good. Yes, not great but good. It's very hard to screw up a game where you just fall past things and then POW, end of stage.   Is it any fun? Hell yeah. Falling and avoiding stuff is kinda fun. Is it repetitive? Hell yeah. Once you fall past the first building, you've basicaly seen everything.   It all comes down to: 'are you a persone with OCD who wants to get the best possible highest score?'  If that's the case this game is for you. However, this game would only need one stage if that were the case. It wouldn't matter that there are so many stages in this game becuase you would be fixated on only one.  'Do you want a game that have progression?' As far as I know, falling means you only travel in one direction.   I think there are many people who would love this game but for me, I'll wait for the movie instead.  
588	1	a	This may be the most appropriately named game I have ever played. In case it isn't clear, the game is about base jumping. Walk off the edge of a building and try not to anything until you reach the bottom while staying as close to other buildings as possible to earn points. The overall concept is simple, but each level still feels unique and the side comments are hilarious!
590	1	a	XD, so funny game really, i guess author of this game was high when he has created this game
592	1	a	So this Indie game is fairly simple and managed to rack up a mostly positive review ratio on steam. There's no storyline, not anything to spoil really however for the casual gamer, this can be a good pass time. If you want a stress free game, this is kind of it.  You are a random guy/girl jumping off either buildings or cliffs or whatever it may be and you have a parachute on your back. You can perform various moves based on the level such as what they are called in-game 'hugs' and 'kisses' (basically getting really close to potentially fatal objects. Your goal is to reach the circle at the bottom without breaking any bones. Simple enough right?  The game gets progressively more difficult as you go along (thank goodness) but apart from the soothing calm music and hugging buildings while your flying through the air, that's pretty much all you do here. Oh, and did I mention that you collect teeth to unlock new levels?  The graphics for some reason remind me of stepmania, don't ask me why, but they suit this game well.  I can't say I would personally play this game for extended periods of time, considering I like more in depth games with stories, emotions and progression. I am in fact a really selective person when it comes to video games. But nonetheless it is still amusing and I can see why the reviews are mostly positive for many people.  My Rating: 5/10
594	1	a	The sound track MMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmmm thats good
596	1	a	Awesome game. I didn't know what to expect when I bought it but it turned out kinda great. It's like an extreme version of Pilotwings: Jump, fly, land, don't break your bones.   I bet this game is even better in VR. If you have the opportunity to play it, don't miss it out.
153	0	a	It is more fun on Android, partly because of the not-so-nice graphics, partly because accelerometer controls are better for this game.
154	0	a	I guess it's sort of a skydiving sim, I just couldn't get into it at all.
598	1	a	interesting game, love it with Oculus rift though.
600	1	a	What's not to love about jumping off buildings?  This game does risk/reward perfectly... you can retry a level at once with no penalty, but the crunch of slamming into the ground is so wrenching that you're sincerely desperate not to die.  Scarier than most horror games, and much more fun!
602	1	a	This game has the best achievement titles ever. 10/10
155	0	a	This is probably much more fun if you have an Oculus Rift, but like the other reviews have said, it gets repetitive really fast.
604	1	a	All bones are meant to be broken.
606	1	a	What is the premise?
608	1	a	This game is like basejumping without all of the broken bones and fractured skulls!
610	1	a	In a nutshell, this is fun but also can be frustrating. You gotta control your character as you freefall and try and rack up the best score possible. It's tough but it's fun. A good indie game. 7.5/10.
612	1	a	This game is definitely worth every penny and I am looking forward to spending the next few days playing this game! :)
614	1	a	This game is a fairly neat little game. It made me feel, not sick as such, but still a little uneasy. I would rate the game 7/10 based on the level design, and then 6/10 for the level selection, it was difficult to cope with.
616	1	a	One of my favourite indie games. The levels are freaking hard, and you can be lose often, but they are very addictive that you feel want to repeat over and over again. I can stay playing one level for 1 hour to beat the level.  A great buy if you want a challenging and adrenaline-pumping game experience, but I think this game is not for everyone because of its difficulties.
618	1	a	The menus are hard to understand at first, and just simply don't look good to me. The humor is pretty cringe worthy, too. The gameplay is nice and fun though, so I'd recommend getting it.
620	1	a	Finally a game for Oculus Rift DK2 which works properly :)
622	1	a	Much more additcitive than I expected!
624	1	a	A ridiculous action game which is really fun to play and try to master. I prefer the iPad version because the tilting mechanic works really well, but I had it on PC first and loved the game enough to buy the iPad version as soon as I got an iPad.
626	1	a	This game is Awesome!
628	1	a	'ADRENALINE RUSH! ALSO OBSTACLES! OH SHIIIIIIIIII-' That pretty much sums up this game. It's fun.
630	1	a	If you want to learn about this game this video is only gameplay footage and will tell/show you everything you need to know about it. It's basically a look at what you'll be playing and takes out all the reviewer fluff that they like to throw in.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GevkSwXpqfU&amp;index=6&amp;list=PLbmOuMgQ8Co6Zf-nLedxXUL8f6Myxs7MY 
632	1	a	This game really should come with a 'do not try this at home' warning. ~12:02 PM ShadowDialga tweeted from Los Angeles County General Hospital
634	1	a	AaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!!! My-head-is-about-to-explode-for-the-Awesome-ness!   In a more serious note, the game controls are precise, gameplay itself is refreshing, and the in-game comments are quite funny. If you are looking for something refreshing, or just a bit nuts, you've found the right game!
636	1	a	Do you like falling? Do you like extremly tripy graphics? Do you like unicorns? If you said yes to any of these questions then this game is for you. But, honestly the game litereraly awesome. infinity out of 10!!!  Now, what whould you do when the world you know ends..............
638	1	a	The game is very good at what it does. It has a good sense of humour and a nice way to show you what you can and can't do. Also, for what the game is about: it's about falling off of buildings and landing in a spot while collecting point on the way down. Has a nice part dedicated to relaxing, and a meditation tutorial (fun to try out)
640	1	a	Great for when you're blazed. 420/10
156	0	a	This game becomes very old very VERY fast. I wouldn't recommend it, not even to kill some time.
642	1	a	All the levels from the first one, pluse many more much harder ones. Pants-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ adrenaline rush.
644	1	a	Old game with new levels, pretty much indie full priced DLC. (Sorta like MW3 except that was retail full priced DLC)
646	1	a	A game that feels thrilling to play (can only imagine how much with Oculus), catches me with quite a few laughs, and an underlying darkness over it all, AAAAA!!! For the Awesome is a quirky little game that, while doesn't evolve terribly beyond its opening concept, does enough to make one desire for more.
648	1	a	AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH WHY DID I JUST JUMP OFF OF A BUILDING FLOATING PROBABLY ABOVE THE STRATOSPHERE  AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH THERE IS SO MUCH TO DODGE IM GOING TO DIIIEEEEE UP HERE AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH Oh hey there people watching me :) AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH I THINK I SEE THE FLOOR OH PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD HIT THE RIGHT SPOT AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH IM ALMOST THERE BUT IM MOVING SO DAMN FAST CAN I EVEN DO THIS? AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH Oh.. I did it... (deep breath)   That was awesome...
650	1	a	Virtually skydive...literally, with the added bonus, if you didn't succeed at first, you can try again. Avoid the obstacles and just go 'AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!!'. Nice scenes and music though to go with it. Motion sickness beware for those who can't handle dramatic motion, especially with a VR headset. Not bad for a short breather though.
158	0	a	Not a fan, the instructions are clear enough but controls are difficult to manage and difficult to orient oneself within the airspace as it's easy to go off course and not be able to get back on track.
652	1	a	This is a fun and cheap yet large game where you jump off a platform and have to get as many points as you can before you hit the ground. Great fun its defiantly worth buying
159	0	a	For a moment, I thought 'The Way of Life,' was my most boring Steam experience, until I recalled this piece!  Pointless!  You do nothing but fall and avoid, getting points by getting as close to buildings for as long as possible. I have better things to do with my time.
654	1	a	A thoroughly unique and enjoyable game with so many levels that I'll probably never play them all. Hugs, kisses, breakthrough targets, birds, fans to greet, haters to flip off, and buildings to tag give players lots of ways to earn as many points as they can as they plummet toward the ground. One frustration I've experienced is that it's sometimes difficult to gauge your speed and desired direction as you approach the landing area which can make for a fantastic run that you lose because you missed the base by a tiny bit or break all the bones in your legs.  Ultimately, though, I find this game enjoyable in short bursts, just a couple of levels and I'm back to work.
656	1	a	Hands down, the best VR game I've ever played. It's pretty good in 2D as well.
658	1	a	Awesome game with awesome soundtracks, awesome gameplay, awesome visuals and awesome humor. This game is indeed, for the Awesome.
162	0	a	At least this is finished.  Pros: Many levels. Stuff to do while falling.  Cons: Falling. It's executed poorly. Beating levels and overall the whole game feels pointless. Scoring is fairly arbitrary and pointless for a point based system, having it tied to progression is a poor design choice. The 'humor' is physical painful.
163	0	a	boring
164	0	a	AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!  IT'S A UNITY WEBTOY.  GET YOUR OWN PLAYLIST READY AND PREPARE TO PLAY THIS GAME ONE HANDED.
660	1	a	AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! For The Awesome holds the record for longest game title. All joking aside, this is a game about jumping off of buildings. (Im serious) You have to get the highest score you can by flying close to buildings and making your descent as creative as possible, all while trying not to die at the same time. This game gives you a rush of excitement and adrenaline as you descend between and around other buildings while at the same time playing a rocking soundtrack. Don't worry about a shortage of levels, there are tons! I'm not sure if this has oculous support (not that I have one at the moment), but if it does, this is THE game for oculous. Just try not to throw up. 10/10 would suicide again. Very fun.
165	0	a	this is a game where you FAaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAALL. There is nothing else. There never will be anything. Fall. Rinse. Repeat. We could learn a lesson or two from AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! for the Awesome. If you had a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ idea for a game might as well make it.
662	1	a	As the name says, it's awesome.
664	1	a	Bosses and employees alike often see performance reviews as a necessary evil. Workers fear hearing their performance is inadequate, while managers struggle to find the best way to balance praise and criticism. But regardless of how a boss feels about putting his or her staff under a microscope, regular performance reviews are an important and constructive way to evaluate the contributions an employee is making to the company.  The goal of a performance evaluation is to give workers feedback on what they are doing right and what needs improvement. Frequent, informal conversations with employees help managers to ensure everyone is staying on task and to address quick, easy-to-solve issues. Formal reviews, on the other hand, can carry much more weight, and even determine an employee's future career path at the company, for better or for worse.  Whether you need a template for your formal, written evaluations or just need help starting a dialogue about performance with your employees, here are a few tips for bosses to make the review process easier and less stressful.
666	1	a	This game is awsome, and I would reccomend it for anyone who is as high as the producers were when they made it.
668	1	a	Fantastic game! I used to get up every morning and drink coffee and play for 20-40 before work. So much adrenaline!  Pros:  Tons of levels (so many it'll take 10+hours and hours to unlock them all) The game starts off a little 'easy' but ramps up in intensity at a very good pace Tons of neat music Weird ♥♥♥ relaxation tapes scattered around to help you 'chill out' (and they actually work) FULL of weird punny/awkward things. I genuinely laughed pretty hard at some You can base jump from space! On the idea that we learned how to build on air You get 'bones and teeth' from passing stages to unlock more stages Everyone in the world needs more 'Hug's and Kisses'  Cons: Breaking every single bone in your body I somehow lost all my progress (all my 'currency' and unlocked levels) when I switched computers and I didn't play AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! for the Awesome for about 6 months. It only happened once and has been fine for a year or two now. I actually enjoyed unlocking all the levels again! I just miss the crazy hard trippy levels that were hard to get to.    The music, the fun graphics, free falling from space, whizzing back and forth avoiding flying cars and electric cables ect.... This game is the whole package of 'cool'  11/10 I love this game. I still boot it up and enjoy it immensely. I've never played a game like this.  
670	1	a	Great for when you're blazed. 420/10
672	1	a	A remaster with new levels, Aaaaa for the Awesome fixes the flaws of the original and improves upon them. It also has VR support and jumping off buildings and parachuting has never been more fun!
674	1	a	Somewhat fun, falling simulator. Felt a bit easy though.
676	1	a	Who deosn't like going fast and scoring points? Oh, and breaking glass with your face, and birds.  It's basejumping in an abstract world with a twisted sense of humor. What's not to love?
166	0	a	It's passable, and I'm sure awesome in Oculus Rift, but as a game for keys/mouse or controller, it's WAY too loose and jittery. Felt like O.R novelty software, like Playstation PLAY games were for the Eyetoy.
678	1	a	Fun game, didn't hold a lot of lasting appeal, but definitely interesting concepts.
680	1	a	An Acrophobia's worst nightmare
682	1	a	10/10
684	1	a	Little clever game where you fall down just to not hit any floating platforms... And flip off your haters. It has tons of levels (not really) and you can have endless hours of fun doing them (not really). Levels are more or less score based, which is mostly gained by basically flying (well, falling) near those floating platforms. Well, what can I say, if it sounds fun, get it!  Lil' Sucky Gameplay to go with the review.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AY5frBlPxQ 
686	1	a	Try saying the title three times really fast.
688	1	a	This game knows you had coffee!!! 10/10
690	1	a	This game is really great with the oculus rift dk2 and surprisingly a whole lot easier to control as opposed to playing it without VR. The problem is that it hasn't been updated to work with the latest rift runtime yet. I fortunately have a secondary computer with win7 and have runtime 0.6 on it but not everyone who has a dk2 will have that option.  I'm giving this a thumbs up and I recommend only if you have a DK2 with runtime 0.6 or if the developers update to run on 0.7+ If you don't have a vr set I recommend this when it's on sale. It's a descent game that will keep you entertained if played for a few minutes a session.
692	1	a	It's kinda hard to not recommend this game, in my opinion. Its fair price implies a decent value and its premise is as simple as it can get: skydiving to get points and unlock more levels. I don't have an Oculus Rift so I relied on the good old ways to experience this game (e.g. mouse and keyboard) and, well, it's a nice afternoon-waster.  The music helps things getting less repetitive and as a game with very arcade-like mechanics, it's still quite enjoyable and has some good replay value if you're particularly keen on high scores and competition in general. I find the menu design to be a little cluttered and of poor taste sometimes, but it's just me being picky anyway.  The 'in-your-face'-ness factor kinda works on this game, and I think it's worth your wallet, especially now that is on sale.
694	1	a	'ADRENALINE RUSH! ALSO OBSTACLES! OH SHIIIIIIIIII-' That pretty much sums up this game. It's fun.
170	0	a	Aaaaaa.....AAA!!! for the Awesome is not quite as grand as the name implies.  The premise of the game is base jumping and attempting to perform some flashy 'stunts' in the process, mostly consisting of falling near the walls to earn 'kisses' and 'hugs', as well as to show off to the crowds with such crazy things as 'thumbs up'. The game definitely does not take itself seriously, which is perhaps the best thing about it. I would have disliked it much more if there was the sense of self-importance that many indie games are saddled with these days.  That said, I still cannot recommend this, purely due to the repetitive nature. Perform a jump, earn 'teeth' or 'kneecaps', unlock a new jump, repeat. The levels are different, but they don't seem to be all that different. They are mostly stylized falls around buildings that could not exist in the real world, and that leads to the levels all having a very 'been there, done that' feel to them even early in the game.  The controls aren't horrible but aren't great either. There seems to be something about pulling the chute and landing that is very intuitive to some players, and horribly counter-intuitive to others. I'm not sure why there is this disconnect, but I know that guiding myself after pulling the ripcord felt more frustrating than trying to carefully skim along the edge of buildings that are staggered back and forth at high speed, and I still don't think I really understand how landing was supposed to work. It should not take more than a half hour of gameplay to have a feel for what is a vital part of the game- after all, an improper landing gets you no stars, and no teeth to unlock another level with.  Now, if you happen to have an Occulus and can go full VR with it, I could see this game having much more appeal. Maybe there is something missing playing on a regular monitor, when there is no real sense of falling (there is no ground that you can fall 'to', and the field of view is pretty restricted with the random floating structures around you anyway). I assumed the game would be pretty fast paced, what with the idea of falling at terminal velocity and all, but it doesn't quite achieve that either.   
171	0	a	Head tracking doesn't work for me. Mac, DK2.
696	1	a	Mindless fun. makes time pass pleasently. Not the best game, but really enjoyable
698	1	a	The wonderfully titled title returns with new levels and massively improved eye-candy, worth buying even if you got it first time around. Can import the previous save data!
700	1	a	100% good fun game very simple and fun for when you dont want to play any more fps games or when you dont want to watch the crap on TV or you have nothin to do. this game will realy stop you from getting bored
702	1	a	This game is a laugh mixed with an awesome (see what i did there!) amount of difficulty and play-time. although I haven't played much, 9/10 would recomend!
704	1	a	Awesome game with an interesting concept. The levels progress in complexity nicely and have varying looks and styles despite using almost always the same building blocks from one to another. The audio feedback system is probably my favorite aspect of the game though since it allows you to focus on trying to get the best run possible without looking at a crowded HUD. I just wish I had an occulus rift to try this game out in VR.
706	1	a	Do you like falling? Do you like extremly tripy graphics? Do you like unicorns? If you said yes to any of these questions then this game is for you. But, honestly the game litereraly awesome. infinity out of 10!!!  Now, what whould you do when the world you know ends..............
708	1	a	jump off buildings and flipp off paparazzi. It's okay I guess. Very repetitive.
710	1	a	Kind of short if your not looking to get 5 stars on every level. It includes all the levels from the original game and even an option to import your progress. Overall it's pretty fun, grab it when it's on sale.
712	1	a	The name says it all!
714	1	a	This game is a laugh mixed with an awesome (see what i did there!) amount of difficulty and play-time. although I haven't played much, 9/10 would recomend!
716	1	a	I thought it was a pretty nice audio synth game. It was pretty good to sit down, chill, grab a drink and play. Very casual, and kept my attention. Pretty great casual game to hang chill with your buds or by yourself.
718	1	a	Holy crap this is awesome!  I got this in the Humble bundle and didn't expect it to be so fun!  Base jumping and flipping people off? Sign me up!
720	1	a	This game is like basejumping without all of the broken bones and fractured skulls!
722	1	a	Fun and challenging if you take the time to progress. It gets a little repetative after a while but if you like kind of a reverse platformer its for you. 7/10.
175	0	a	Pretty fun game. It is a novel idea of base jumping, and the game is certainly not easy, but the levels are tough in a fun way. The developers released some new free levels, and the opening message about the developers changing every time was funny and original, plus you gotta love the owl for the symbol. There is a lot of fun to be had while flying down at amazing speeds narrowly missing things and fitting into tight holes (yes, that's what she said, I know you were thinking it). It has that exhilirating feeling when you go so fast you can barely keep up, you sometimes get the actual feeling with a little feeling in your stomach that sometimes goes into your ♥♥♥♥/balls (guys you know what I'm talking about).   So why am I giving the game a down vote, for a few reasons. First off, although the idea is fun at first, it can be very repetitive because you literally just base jump for the entirety of the game, which isn't that short. It can start to become mundane because you're doing the same thing for the 100th time. Also, most levels are the exact same, with the same buildings and obstacles. More variety of where you are jumping would be nice. There are a few with rocks and a mountain, as well as a giant pipe, but for the most part the levels were interchangeable, which doesn't help with the repetition. More thought could have been put into level design. Also the few things that can add something to do (tagging buildings and giving thumb signals) stay the same throughout, so even after they are introduced in the first few levels, you never gain anything else to do, which once again adds to the monotony. Some other things to do would be nice. Also the tagging and thumb signals aren't very accurate and you can look at things and press the button and it won't count, and the game doesn't give you a good enough indication whether or not you actually got it. They are a little too finnicky sometimes, and could have been polished more.  Now for the worst problem. Although I am fine with having high scores and points, it should be for people that want to get leaderboards and want to replay a game. In this game, your star rating gets you stuff you have to use to unlock levels. This is fine for a while but then newer levels cost more than if you get a 5 star on a single level, which makes no sense. I got mostly 4-5 stars on all the levels, with some 3s, and only a very few 1-2s, and I couldnt afford to play about 10 levels. It seems so stupid that a developer would make something and make it soo inaccessible. You should not be decided to play more of the game based on a random score or time the developer chooses for you. That is what the leaderboards and other things are for the idiots that wanna keep replaying a level to get as high of a score as possible. I don't want to have to keep repeating every level till I get 5 stars just to be able to play more, because if thats the case then why include 1-4 stars, it's just stupid. FORCED did it too with challenges and SMB did it with secret hidding bandages and level speed run times. It is such a dumb and lazy concept used to force replay value on those that don't want it. They fix it with the added hard levels (what does it say that hard levels it the value you get and cost of new levels is MORE fair and balanced than regular levels). There are a ton of levels though, so good for them. But since I cannot finish the game because of stupid game design I cannot fully endorse the game. 5.5/10.
724	1	a	Many levels ! This game si really like it name : Awesome !
726	1	a	An Acrophobia's worst nightmare
728	1	a	This game is just plain fun. Live out your adrenaline dreams in this BASE jumping game
730	1	a	10/10
732	1	a	10:43 PM - mokrun: 'flee' in a main menu is an exit button apparently 
734	1	a	If you like hugs and kisses, simple geometric figures and always wanted to know what it's like to skydive, then by all means buy this game.
736	1	a	you are falling fast thinking is not an option try to stay alive
738	1	a	I have no idea what i just Played, but it is fast, it has lots of coulours and a i like it.
740	1	a	One of my favourite indie games. The levels are freaking hard, and you can be lose often, but they are very addictive that you feel want to repeat over and over again. I can stay playing one level for 1 hour to beat the level.  A great buy if you want a challenging and adrenaline-pumping game experience, but I think this game is not for everyone because of its difficulties.
742	1	a	This is a building-kissing-whilst-free-falling simulator. You'll have to figure out if it appeals to you yourself.
744	1	a	It's a very wired game but oddly fun. Good music and interesting level design.
746	1	a	Random, but fun game to play, great when your bored
748	1	a	Fun digital experiance with skydiving and proximity diving. its worth being picked up.
180	0	a	At least this is finished.  Pros: Many levels. Stuff to do while falling.  Cons: Falling. It's executed poorly. Beating levels and overall the whole game feels pointless. Scoring is fairly arbitrary and pointless for a point based system, having it tied to progression is a poor design choice. The 'humor' is physical painful.
750	1	a	I enjoy the dumb music, judiciously added mechanics and general zaniness.
181	0	a	boring
752	1	a	I really like humor of this game in text and pictures. I'd love to try it in VR set, I guess, it should be awesome.
754	1	a	Stressed? Need to let steam out?  THEN JUMP!!!!
756	1	a	Hong Kong suicide simulator is one of the most thrilling games I've played, during my time as a 'GAMER', but I was quite confused at the strange game systems. Despite the fact that our character, Ju-long Liu, a depressed Chinese businessman from the Guangdong Province, who's fed up with life, is constantly making futile attempts to collide with buildings, and/or die, it is our decision, as the potentially cruel, morally gray observer to deploy his parachute, and make him merely 'hug' or 'kiss' the buildings as he plummets. We are also rewarded money for our actions, and again, Ju-long Liu makes more futile plummets off the side of buildings.   Overall, it was enjoyable, but I'm incredibly confused, and I need time to think about what I've just played.
183	0	a	This is a game that has a really neat mechanic and idea, but doesn't have the sort of gameplay that keeps me engaged for very long. After playing it for 20 minutes, I feel like I won't get much more out of it. What it does do, it does very well. Maybe try before you buy.
184	0	a	Not bad but gets repetitive real quick. I'd give it a neutral rating if I could.
758	1	a	This game knows you had coffee!!! 10/10
760	1	a	It's rare for a game to be so thrilling and so easy to pick up. It's fast pace means you quickly re-enter the game to give it another shot, and it's scoring system means you can approach each level at your own pace. During really well however is both challanging and super rewarding, somehow translating the serious thrill of base jumping without the petty concern of safety.
186	0	a	Not interesting game! The name of the game itself in steam library makes me crazy!
762	1	a	An interesting idea for a game, fun and lots of content.
187	0	a	Don't buy this, its literally trash.  As someone else said 'Takes longer to install than to get bored of. '
188	0	a	I thought this was something different and better... Got bored in 20 minutes.   Pathetic graphics for this kind of simplicity. Music is average, nothing special. The worst thing about this game are the menus... 3d boxes with text on them...  PS: The title of this game was done by a 5y old.
764	1	a	Somewhat fun, falling simulator. Felt a bit easy though.
766	1	a	Quite a fun little game. I don't normally like this kind of thing but it is very enjoyable and gets difficult very quickly if you want to keep making good scores.
768	1	a	A game that's all about risktaking - the closer you're willing to get to the buildings you're falling by, the higher your scores will get. Easy to learn. Mindless fun. Reminds me a little of Counter-Strike 'surf' maps. PS: I've played the 'A Reckless Disregard for Gravity' version much longer.
770	1	a	At first I watched the videos for this game, and I was pretty interested. But then I started reading some of the negative reviews, and I wasn't so sure about getting it anymore. Having now played it for myself, it is actually pretty awesome. Now I'm thinking at least some of these harsh negative reviews are from people who bought other games from the company that made this. Because as I understand it, after this game they released a number of others which were decidedly unfinished and that understandably ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off the people who bought them. So I'm guessing those people are responsible for much of the negative reviews on this game. But honestly, I found it funny, fun, and addictive without feeling repetitive.
772	1	a	Heh. What a trip.
774	1	a	This is a great game for a couple reasons. 1. It's unique and 2. This game is outstanding in VR. I dont have an Oculus (YET!) but I got this working in stereoscopic 3D with my Emagin Z800's and it is mindblowing :) If you plan on geting an Oculus this is a must buy!  You will look over the edge and feel parts start to pucker. Then you will jump.   Will jump again..
776	1	a	Played without Oculus: 'Meh'  Played with Oculus: 'Drugs'  10/10 would fall again
778	1	a	'Your femurs are now femur paste', as they should be if you don't enjoy this game. Base jumping. From space. With tagging. Why haven't you bought this yet?
780	1	a	i find this game brilliant, its a clever idea, a base jumping game, well built, gets harder and harder to avoid dying (you are a sack of broken calcium)
782	1	a	Spectacular Falling! Decending Dance! Can you Splat? Most Assuredly!! Chase that High Score! Quickly, quickly! It's getting away! Ooooh dear now you are meat paste on high-rise window. Never mind! Try again! DEJOBAAN!
784	1	a	This expansion for 'A Reckless Disregard for Gravity' (which is one of the best game names ever) adds graphical improvements, gets the game running better on modern systems and adds a bunch of new levels and gameplay improvements. The point of the game is to fly in your futuristic wingsuit as close to the futuristic buildings as possible, while smashing through point-scoring panels, giving thumbs-ups to your fans and flinging middle fingers at protesters. If you can do all that and then land without messily killing yourself, you'll earn 'teeth' that you then use to unlock powerups and new levels. That's all there is to it, pretty much...and it really doesn't need more than that. I nominated this game for the 'Whoooaaaaaaa, Dude!' awared because I guarantee you'll say that the first time you play it.
786	1	a	This game is fun, but gets old very soon.
788	1	a	Awesomely awesome!
790	1	a	Really fun game to waste boring days on.
792	1	a	Challenging. That's the word you want to read and remember. You drive a motorcycle and you have to do stunts to get to the finish line. The graphics are great, the sounds as well, and the puzzles are, well... remember that word I told you to at the beginning of this mini review ? Yes ? Great ! My job is done.  Excellent game though ! Great to play for a few minutes or a few hours.  [Rating: 80/100]
794	1	a	A true Classisc its hard, frustrating and adictive as hell . Did i say technically hard as hell but so rewarding when you pull it off. To me one of the best physics based trails games ever made. It doesnt have no bull ♥♥♥♥ tricks. Just a pure challange to make the perfect run
796	1	a	I love all the Trials games but this is probably my favorite.
798	1	a	Yeahhh! It's a really nice game!
800	1	a	Very fun game to play but gets very hard near end,Very hard
802	1	a	If you are a glutton for punishment or a perfectionist any Trails game is great for you. Brutal difficulty, beautiful graphics and simple but deep controls combine to make a great game that will make you grind your teeth in pleasure.
804	1	a	Trials 2 is a great game, i had great times playing it. Controls are very simple, just throttle, break, tilt back and forward, but the game becomes very technical as you pass the levels and every little movement will count on your performance.  It´s not like all those tilt games out there, this has really nice physics and gameplay, and a lot of havoc! Also is a great game to play when you only have 5 or 10 minutes available.   You can race with ghosts or watch replays from others players, and when you see the best players runs you cannot believe how good you can get to be. It´s a very fun game with a lot of crazy stunts, i recommend it to any person.
806	1	a	A blast with a dark sense of humour
808	1	a	A great time waster / casual game where you can compare your progress and skills to those of your friends.  Polished, fun and addictive, great for whiling away 20 minutes here and there.
810	1	a	Alright game 7/10
812	1	a	This game is so addictive. You can waste hours on a single track just to get better scores. Some of the tracks are realy hard and you need a lot of practice to reach the end and more practice to finish it without falling from your bike. You can view the rides of everyone as a replay or use them as a ghost. Most of them are just amazing. A must have in my view ;)
814	1	a	PC version of Flappy Bird. Annoying when you die but you can't stop playing
816	1	a	Great game. Super hard and the crashes are very satisfying. Still better than any of the newer trials games that I've played.
818	1	a	So ur this dude on a dirt byke ryt,  u go VRRRRRRRRRRRRRM VRM VRMMMMMMM!!!! and complete obstacle course like tracks, the harder the difficulty - the more you will want to throw your computer right out the ♥♥♥♥in window.  Fun game for a few minutes every day, great way to ♥♥♥♥ away 20 minutes while you wait for your latest Blueray rip 1080p porno staring Sasha Grey and Lexi Belle to download.
820	1	a	A physics game disguised as a motorbike riding game, Trials 2: Second Edition is a great little title that's sure to keep you playing for hours. The task is usually to get to the end of the level without falling off your bike. It sounds simple enough, but sometimes, especially in the later levels, you'll really have to stop and think before revving off a ramp without knowing what steep banks lie ahead. It's a blast playing a level over and over until you finally pass it without falling one time. If it sounds like you'd enjoy this kind of thing, you would. I recommend that you try it out.  Oh, one more thing. The game has a decent crash system where your guy can flip off his bike and break bones and stuff. It's weird seeing him flail around after he's already on the ground, smacking his arms around and breaking them even more. It's absurd, but oddly hilarious. It adds a nice touch to humor you a bit when you've failed.
822	1	a	amazing worth every penny that i collected to buy it
824	1	a	Challenging and fun physics game!
826	1	a	This game is amazing and will suck many hours out of your life. I need more friends to buy it so I have more records to beat!
828	1	a	I am basically a FPS gamer, however just because the price was right I downloaded TRAIL 2 and I gotta say, the game is pretty cool, good graphics and pretty addictive. For a switch of pace, try this game, its only $2.50 (12/22/2010) and its the best $2.50 game, (other than F.E.A.R) I ever spent.
830	1	a	Holy heck.... BUY THIS GAME while it's $2.50 or whatever.... what a FUN game
832	1	a	i ♥♥♥♥ing love ragdoll physics.
834	1	a	Doesn't get any more challenging and addictive than Trials 2.
836	1	a	I love trials games, and Trials 2: Second Edition was where it all started for me. I played this game for hours at a time, on a daily basis, for months. Endless, minimalistic fun, with plenty of achievements and leaderboards to compete for/with. If you're just getting started with Trials games, this is the perfect game for you.
838	1	a	This is one of the most exciting and addictive game that I've already played. When you start playing, you won't stop until break your records, you'll want to be better in each track you play. And in the March 22th will be realeased the Trials Evolution: Gold Edition for PC. And will have a lot of inovations for the game be more atractive and competitive, for spend a lot of your time in the game. This game is like drugs, when you start, you'll never stop, but I think that is a good drug, or no. So, if you want a reaally good game, that will help you when you'are bored, this is the perfect choice!
840	1	a	this game is very hard so you must have great Patience to compele the task or else break your bone..ouch!!...yep bodybag..lol it's not a bad game at all.  the graphic is pretty good, nice to use xbox pad for this....
842	1	a	i ♥♥♥♥ing love ragdoll physics.
844	1	a	Impossible, dangerous and annoying so overall good.
846	1	a	Holy heck.... BUY THIS GAME while it's $2.50 or whatever.... what a FUN game
848	1	a	very addicting, tough to master and fun for hours, play with a friend in the room and take turns at beating the tracks. I use an Xbox360 controller it's very hard with a keyboard to be percise on this game WHICH YOU HAVE TO!! (you can play with a 360 controller on most games because 'PC is Microsoft' and you just bought another controller from logitech or something??)
850	1	a	This is the most annoying, time wasting and horrid game ever developed, but it's still charming in its own weird way, buy it!
852	1	a	♥♥♥♥ is crazy!
854	1	a	Cool little indie game, the game actually requires skills and it's hard to become good at it, worth it for the couple of bucks that it was during the summer sale.
856	1	a	I have yet to find a game more frustrating and rewarding than Trials 2. It's basically the same exact motorcycle physics puzzle platformer we all played as a kid, but with a shiny new coat of paint and leaderboards. Not a bad way to spend $10.
858	1	a	Trials 2 is a ton of fun to play in short bursts. It's challenging making tricky jumps and landing at the right angles. It's also hilarious to watch as your driver crashes over and over and over again. Even when the game gets frustrating it's more difficult to notice or care because the crashes are so comically terrible. There's a nice bit of satisfaction to be had when that hard track is finally overcome. I recommend just for ♥♥♥♥♥ 'n' giggles.
860	1	a	i ♥♥♥♥ing love ragdoll physics.
862	1	a	Be prepared to break every bone in your body, including your controller!

868	1	a	i bought this game and now it says i dont have it  
870	1	a	Great underrated game
872	1	a	Still one of my favorites games to come back to from time to time. I played this long before I had Steam and would play for hours on end. These days, I come back to it for perhaps just a few tracks at a time, but it's still fun. It's a great fix when you just need some Trials action for a bit and the newer games maybe aren't an option.
874	1	a	This game is only for kids.. under 5.. They shall love it.. !!
876	1	a	♥♥♥♥ING DO IT...IT RAPES YOUR SOCKS OFF
878	1	a	I didn't really enjoy this game but my 4 year old daughter does. She likes to play it because she can finish quite a few levels by pressing down 1 button... the 'forward' button. Ok, ok, you need to use 3 more buttons and a lot more skill if you want to win a gold medal on each course but she isn't interested in gold medals. She's happy if she can drive the car to the finish line... which she can by pressing that one button.
880	1	a	A very creative fun game that keeps you thinking. I loved this game and how fun it was to play. The monster trucks were awesome to play once you put in the cheat code to unlock them. I loved each level because they were all different and creative. There were times that you would fail and not understand why you failed so badly but just plain persistence and patients pays off when you beat the course record and get gold. If you want codes to help you out here are the best one's: Go to the Settings menu and enter the codes into the Unlock extra features box.  DEVHOSENAUTO: Unlock Formula Monster Truck PIGGYRIDE: Unlock Pig Monster Truck YELLOWMONSTER: Unlock School Bus DEVIWANTALLGOLDNOW: All Levels GOLD DEVIWANTITALLNOW: Unlock all levels   I loved this game and all it had to offer, just make sure to find this one on sale because then you will get your money out of it. I have totally loved playing this game and if you liked the game Trials 2: Second Edition then you will love this one!
882	1	a	it passes the time.
884	1	a	From it's humble origin as a browser time-waster, this fantastic game comes to a steam client near you!  Excellent fun and fiendish puzzles to overcome!
886	1	a	I'm surprised how much I enjoyed this game. One of the first I ever bought on Steam, and I played it to death. If you like the demo, you'll love the full version. It's kind of like Trials HD with a better aesthetic, a better difficulty curve, and more fun.
888	1	a	Very nice and fast game.i enjoyed it. i really liked all the mods and also the different characters. too bad there arent any players playing it because bots are too easy...
890	1	a	Customization is pretty cool on this game, And pretty funny when playing with mates.
892	1	a	A fun low-budget multi-player arcade racing game similar to Mario Kart.  Surprisingly, it features many game modes, which not always involve racing per se. The controls are arcade-ish and the power-ups are always fun to use against your peers: 'EAT DA LOVE BOTS FOOLS!! MWAHAHA&lt;3' (there's an achievement for this). Customizing your vehicle and avatar is enjoyable as well - just take a look at what people posted on the steam hub!  Unfortunately, they never added new content and the game is no longer supported by the developers. Although the game is moddable, it never really got any attention from the modscene.  Buy the 4-pack (during winter/summer sale, it usually goes for US$4) to play with your friends since most public servers are deserted nowadays.
894	1	a	This is a very fun kart game with some very unique minigames. If you do like games like Mario Kart then this is a nice pick up. There are some weird physics with this game sometimes but it is very enjoyable and fun when playing with friends :)
224	0	a	Zero Gear is a cart combat multiplayer online party game. Its more than eight player racing, the maps have a variety of objectives such as three-on-three European and American football. There are battle modes such as using boxing gloves to knock other cars over the edge of a sumo ring into the abyss below. Other maps are skeeball and even a pachinko machine with your cars. Its a true party game for anyone that has seven other friends online with this budget game. The game does offer a four pack for the price of two, which is always incentive. If you have no friends, the real problem is that five years after its release, there is no one playing.  The game plays easy with an accelerator, a nitro boost, a mini jump for sharper turns. You can gain nitro by drafting behind other competitors or touching a floating dreidel. In fact almost touching it is good enough. The boost will put you at your top speed in an instant rather than slowly increasing speed or shooting you forward, so its just as useful to use the boost when you've got the minimum or maximum amount. In other words, just hold down that boost button. If you ever fall off a track or stray too far from the path, you can use a respawn button. There is optional full mouse camera support and even a free aim button so you can target another competitor.  Like all cart combat games you have weapons. In this case there are two buttons to use a weapon in front or behind you. Its shallow in term of weapon variety and you get them by driving through hovering boxes. There is a bubble shield, a boxing glove, a pink love robot that will follow and then hug on the nearest driver until it explodes. You can also get a mine to drop, and a tornado that will throw anyone caught in its winds. Ice blocks will freeze an enemy and send them gliding forward with no ability to turn. Even frozen in ice, their tires will spin, so that feels like an overlooked detail.  Perhaps the most context sensitive item to use is the spring that lets you jump. While the spring can be used to jump over things, I consider this to be more useful for doing backflips and barrel rolls to get more boost. When you're in the air with any jump, you have full tilt control of your vehicle.  If you're all alone you can play with bots, but victories feel hollow without a single player campaign or cup of any sort. You can setup quick matches and assign the fifteen events you want to play. With the quick matches its just you and three other bots playing the same even twice for whatever reason before you progress to the next map. You can always setup a more complex server, but it takes a bit longer.  In terms of customization, you have a lot to chose from. Your car, your gear, your helmet and your face wear. Everything is customization and adds a lot of silly character to the game to make you stand out from the pack online. You can be a hovering brain wearing a clown nose with blonde pig tails driving a boat car. A nice option is randomization, so you can end up with a pink squid wearing a moon helmet driving a bomb with spike tires. Speaking of spike tires, when you use them, you can tell if you let off the accelerator the tires stop completely even if you continue to move forward.  As for the tracks themselves, the races are all closed circuits with only two or three laps. The shortest course has eight laps, but it feels like a strict circle.The driving surfaces are needlessly wide so the focus is more on the weapons instead of the driving skill. Each course has a few ramps and jumps here and there. You'll even go down a bumpy ski slope, a wavy slide and a water slide. Each course is bright and colorful. Its all very appealing to the eyes to make that quick fun joy ride feeling.  There's a lot of creativity with the courses, a pool and water slide, driving on a billiard tapble that connects to an air hockey course. Even the standard race track circuit shows a lot of flair. The desert themed track has you racing outside and then through a crystal mine across wooden roads. The creativity and effort shows, but the thing that holds the design back in my eyes are the lack of hazards. There's a dirt stadium that could use some slowing mud. These wide tracks just need something else on them like a shallow river. The water park has a lot of water, but it has no affect on you even if the water slide can rotate you backward as you go down..  Then there are quirky events such as the basketball, American and European football events that have you trying to score a goal with a gigantic sports ball. While I like the idea, the practice of it in Zero Gear is lacking, its dull and imprecise. Speaking of dull, nothing can trump the tag chase event in terms of boredom. The tag chase has a timer where only one person's time increases. The one that fills their meter first wins the event. Well this takes forever, because everyone else's meter goes down. To make things interesting, the mode will change where the one that is it will decrease in time, making a long mode even longer. These cars are so tiny on such an open wide map that its tough to tag anyone. If the person that's it falls off the level, its up for grabs in the center again.  While a lot of the other events are fun and unique, they feel thrown together such as the pachinko and skeeball games. These are simple games based on points. You use your car to drive off a cliff or ramp and fall down into the pachinko or fly into the skeeball. The skeeball feels like skill, the pachinko feels like dumb luck. This is strictly filler content to flaunt as a frill.  There is controller support, just not in the menus. Default controls needed to be adjusted because some of the buttons were forgotten about. Even adjusting the controls, there is no menu button to adjust, so there's no pause with a controller. In fact there is no pause, because an online game keeps going even with bots. Instead there's a menu with no way to rebind the menu.  Zero Gear feels like it can benefit from from better events and a single player series of races against more intelligent opponents. There is something good here, but it needs to go deeper and bigger. More weapons, more races, more hazards. I'm sure it was fun when its multiplayer was still alive, but with such a small budget game, I wonder how alive it ever was. The game lives and dies on its multiplayer. Judging from the 25% of people with the first achievement, people went into the game, saw that its multiplayer only and went right back out.
896	1	a	This game was a great surprise. It has a lot of different game modes, the items are well-designed, the controls are responsive and it's a lot of fun to play with friends. A solid game overall.
898	1	a	Best game 10/10 would pay for again Only play with friends when you're really tired.
900	1	a	It's cool if you like cart racing stuff or have played Hot wheels, it's fun to play, though not many people play it so you might have to play with bots most of the timesl.
902	1	a	GOOD GAME  0 SERVERS ADD ME TO PLAY IM SO LONELY WITH BOTS
904	1	a	Reminds you of the good old mario kart. I suggest you get it while it's still 0.99€
226	0	a	  This game is kind of fun with many different game modes (some are very boring, others not so much.) The thing is, you can't play in single player if you aren't connected to the internet which means you have to be connected to the internet  at all times  in order to play. honestly, that is the main reason I dislike this game. the graphics are OK, however, the colors on some maps are way too bright; I had to adjust the color settings on my monitor (I would go blind otherwise). I'm definitely  not  playing this game again.
906	1	a	Really Nice game it's seen like mario kart 8 but very different you can customize your own charater a lot of nice stages :D    10/10
908	1	a	ONE of the best games to play with friends. Yes the charaters are custonmizable and thier cars as well. Sometimes cant have enough of this game. Just laughing
910	1	a	Despite the cartoonish graphics, it is an amazing and fun game to play! Even if you don't enjoy racing games that much ( Like me) , buy the game, you won't regret it :) And we will not regret it either, because we will have another person to play with sometimes. :) Add me as friend if you want to play togheter. :)
912	1	a	This is the best fun based racing car game i've ever played. Its ultra super fun 10/10 would buy again. The only bad thing is that there is no one who plays this game (multiplayer).
227	0	a	  -Quick Review-   Zero Gear is an indie Racing game, the community is pretty much dead, but if you don't feel like you've had enough kart games, here you go, just for you. Disclaimer: I'm voting it down *not* because it's a bad game, but because the community is dead, you will play by yourself 9 times out of 10. (Maybe you don't mind that? Maybe you want to play a racing game by yourself? Go ahead and get it, lol)    -Detailed breakdown review-    Story:  Instead of a telling the gist of the story (there is none) I'm going to tell my own story. The first time I loaded this game I listen to the soundtrack and though 'Woa! This sound really good' I called my brother over and said 'doesn't that sound like it has good potential?' I clicked 'quick game' and  BAM  all my hopes and dreams were crushed... This was in fact... a racing game.  To provide a back story, I've always strongly disliked racing games and driving games. But Saints Row 3, Mafia 2, and Just Cause 2 have all forced me to learn how to drive in video games.   Game Play:  The first game I played was some type of 'Soccer' (or 'Football' for those whom aren't in the USA), this is probably the worst game in the batch. There are several game modes: Tag, Race, and Soccer. All of these can be played and learned, however it takes a bit of getting used to the turning style... Much to my frustration when learning the basics of the game. Soccer/Football/Hockey, your goal is to get the ball/puck into the other team's goal (pun intended). Race is where you drive in circles for a few laps and try to beat the NPC's, because humans don't play this game anymore. Tag, for those of you with no childhood; is when you run away from one person because he/she was designated being 'it', whatever it is, who knows? In this game it's reversed. You WANT to be it, so you can score points and win.   Achievements:  There are 45 Achievements in Zero Gear, Most of them are easily obtainable, however a number of them are bugged, and still more require the assistance of one friend.   Price  the price for Zero gear, is $4.99 that's pretty fair, if you really want this game just wait for a steal sale, you can probably pick it up for a couple dollars.   Conclusion:  AHHH a racing game. *deletes the devil from my computer*  Again, I'm giving it the thumbs down because most people probably won't want to spend time playing this game. The game works, and I could go one way or another, but with my friends interest in mind; probably should just skip this game. You could get a more delightful indie games for the same price.
914	1	a	Bro it was 0.99 cents what was I suppose to do not buy it?
916	1	a	I've play'd this game a lot with Friends while i was on Teamspeak with them. It is a really fun Game to play, similar to Mario Kart. It has bugs, the handling of the Cars is a bit tricky, but those Maps like 'Sumo Arena' are just too much fun! Get it in Sale for some Bucks, its worth it !
918	1	a	So many laughs were had, would reccomend.
920	1	a	Very good game omg so fun
922	1	a	Zero Gear is like Mario Kart for PC. Tons of customisation, great characters to choose from. Nice to play with bots and multiplayer. Whilst most people would prefer to just get out their DSes and play the actual Mario Kart, this is a flawless alternative for PC gamers!
924	1	a	Nice racing game.
926	1	a	Really a fun game, tons of customizes,Funny and raging gameplay and if you have friends playing it, it's so much fun! I love the minigames too like hockey,football or pachinko, not only races!  10/10 I love this game
228	0	a	At first glance, Galactic Bowling appears to be a whimsical casual bowling game with a sci-fi setting that could be a lot of fun. Upon actually playing it, the controls will make you want to throw your entire computer out the window. Whatever I paid for this, years ago, it was too much.
229	0	a	 Graphics:
230	0	a	If you wanted to ruin a bowling game, this game is the definition to go by. First you add a horrible story, then horrible controls. With these two throw in changing physics that are mind boggling and maybe a few special abilities that are special in the sense you'd be a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ to use them.   Don't buy this game unless you like to suffer.
231	0	a	this game is awful I bought it while drunk or something years ago and regretted it immediately, you can get a perfect score every round by throwing the ball the same way every time, totally stupid
232	0	a	I love bowling games, but this doesn't have smooth or intuitive controlls.   *If you are looking for a cool bowling game with a lot of personality get Zombie Bowl-O-Rama.
233	0	a	Terrible game...just save yourself the money
234	0	a	i wouldn't spend a dollar on this game
235	0	a	Do not waste your money on this game.
236	0	a	Menu screen works fine. The game itself, however, just gives me a black screen.

934	1	a	Well my rank is Diamond League and im 2nd player on worldwide...But afterall i can say if you have 'fast fingers' and 'good memory'(those are important to get better quickly), i recommend this game for you.It will probably very fun for you.The community maybe in silent for now.But i cant say its bad.Also items are not %100 RNG ,when you get pro ,you will get this.  Disadvantages :   When you join to other continents player lobby's this game becomes almost unplayable for you... above than 200 ping is pretty grind on this game.   And you may keep searching for a lobby like 10-15 minutes but if u'r rank is below than bronze you dont wait that much.(if its stuck just reset the steam)   Kind of mechanic bugs are here(but devs will solve them in time, i think) Community 8/10 Gameplay 9.5/10  with friends 9/10 Alone 7/10 Drug 10/10  Connection with other players 5/10 Trolls/smurfs:few Hackers: non

946	1	a	 SpeedRunners  is exactly what the game says it is - A cut-throat competitive platformer. And it. Does. Not. Disappoint.    Pros  :  1. Simple, easy, and extremely fun (With friends, ten times that). 2. Soundtrack is amazeballs. 3. Progressively challenging. 4. Wide variety of funky characters to choose from. 5. Brilliant level designs.    Cons  :  1. Minimal amount of players during matchmaking. 2. Lack of advertising for the game. Not many people buy it. Please, buy it.  It may not look visually appealing, or promising, but that's what even I thought before I actually went ahead and bought it. This is a  must-buy  for those who love party-oriented games.

964	1	a	Alright, SpeedRunners is a fast-paced racing game that looks nothing like (and plays nothing like) a normal racing game. It blends elements from platformers and other genres seamlessly... kind of. The game has a considerable amount of glitches and bugs, but it's been improved considerable since I first reviewed this game and it's a much closer to flawless. There's a lot of glitches that I originally complained about, and I think the dev's edits and fixes to them has been phenomenol and deserves it's own mention. There's still a few issues, mostly with lag, but that's hardly a fixable issue due to poor ISP's and everything. That being said, the game is still an amazing game. I would play this 24/7 if it didn't have it's road bumps (and, as you can see, I've still played it religiously). From what I've seen, the 'Story' mode is mainly bug-free, and if you can't handle the lag from online players, you can always play with AI and friends in a custom lobby. There's a built-in solution for every issue I have found, so in reality, by the end of this, a LOT of people might be saying 'SpeedRunners is an amazing game and you're wrong!' and I'd agree, especially since it's much more tolerable than other games *cough* Monstrum *hacking*, and it runs at a very smooth framerate for a game of this size and quality (most games I can't play in a resolution above 800x600. This game I certainly can). Finally, I say buy this game for 3 main reasons: it has surpassed many MANY more games on the steam store, it's no longer Early Access, and it's an amazing game already. who wouldn't want to race their friends in a cartoon world of a guy in a unicorn suit, a cat, and a detective dog? I certainly do.

992	1	a	Updating my review in line with release to be much more comprehensive, I'm going to use the spoiler format thing again since if people just want a quick look at one aspect of a review it should be easier to find than a wall of text, there's bound to be a better format but meh, it will do.  Rating: Look at my time it's kind of irrelevant what I say at this stage, right?  Overview of gameplay:   High speed elimination based race, up to 4 players compete to travel through maps as possible using a combination of a traditional double jump mechanic and a grappling hook mechanic. Game also has weapons which can be used to mess up your opponents.    Some gameplay tags: Very Fast-paced, High skill cap, simple mechanics, repetetive, addictive  Recommended Audience (my opinion):   1. Groups of friends looking for an easy game to pick up and have fun with (probably wont pass 30 hours gameplay if in this group)  2. People who want a competetive multiplay platforming/racing experience  3. Anyone (Seriously it's a damn good game, I'm far too lazy to write a review like this for most games :D     Pros: Easy to get into   I highly recommend learning the game initially with friends who are also new to the game, the start of the game has alot of just learning maps and can be very rough unfortunately if you are not partnered with friends/other newbies, even a few hours could give someone a massively unfair advantage over a new player and hurt the experience for them.   Very Fun Fast Paced High Skill Cap Live Update: New content / bugfixes regularly implemented Customisable graphics (Trails, characters and object mods) Not very resource intensive Pro-active Developers    This is a very important point, the devs of this game are constantly looking for feedback and, while I might personally disagree with some of their choices and initiatives, I think they deserve massive praise for their approach to the development. They listen to the community and always try to look out both for the experienced players and the newer players.....I just happen not to be in sync with the community on several discussions hence the disagreements.    Streaming and community content on front-page:    Not a big deal but just a nice touch, if you release a good video or guide you might be featured on the front page after the game opens and if you stream the game there is a tab which will show your league, your current viewers and give an easy link to your stream, just a nice little touch    Cons: Heavily repetetive:    It's basically a racing game with, imo, slightly mechanics and weapons, there's 35ish? tracks at the time of release that are curated or official and gameplay off of these is rare unless you personally go looking for it   Ranked System: (Due for an overhaul according to devs, will update this review if it is updated and improved) Extremely simple mechanics:   This is both a pro and a con, on the one hand it makes the game much better for picking up and playing, on the other hand it often feels like levels are all played the same, the techniques used for speed rarely vary and weapons provide most the variety   Speed Cap:   This won't affect your gameplay for a very long time after you start but if you go for long enough this becomes a big issue. You take routes or do tricks that should give more speed but still everyone ends up travelling the same speed making route variation pointless and suboptimal     Other comments: Soundtrack is only ok, not necessarily a con but worth mentioning  Doesn't handle latency amazingly well but vastly improved on this issue so no longer worthy of a con, I have no major issues even though I can't get wired net where I live.  Player count is currently a bit low which prevents the implementation of certain gameplay refinements that I think the devs would like to put in but this shouldn't put you off buying the game, games are always available and community is (mostly) nice

998	1	a	SpeedRunners is one of the games that can be proud that it broke the early access curse and was fully released not too long ago.   SpeedRunners at least in my eyes is one of the most fun games I've played in recent memory. The thrill of being in first and the feeling that you can't be stopped by your opponents is just purely amazing and I think everyone needs to experience it.  In the story mode of SpeedRunners you play as Speedrunner and you try to become the best by overthrowing the other speedrunners.   But enough about the story, let's get into the gameplay:  The entire game is based on speed. You try to outrun all your opponents and the last one alive wins, win three times and you win the game.   Anything goes, you can use weapons,grapling hooks, explosives and all sorts of stuff. Some stuff can backfire on you so be careful on how you use the power ups.  The Graphics are awesome and I love the art style. Everything from animations, backgrounds and characters, everything looks amazing.  The soundtrack at first, I liked, but it get's tiresome really fast and I just really prefer to either mute the game and put on something else or just don't wear headphones.  The main campaign took me 1 hour to finish, and there is some replay value. You can go through the campaign more than a few times and unlock more stuff like maps and characters.   I didn't encounter any issues while running this game and I highly doubt anyone will too, so you are good to go.  Overall I don't have anything bad to say about SpeedRunners. It's an amazing game and I highly suggest you check it out and you will get sucked into it.   Pros: +Great gameplay +Outstanding Art Style +Outstanding multiplayer   Cons: -Incredibly short campaign  Final Rating: 9/10  If you liked this review, please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you disliked post in the comments on what you disliked about it.

1004	1	a	This game is literally all I play now. SpeedRunners is a multiplayer racing game with up to four players where you choose and unlock all sorts of comical characters to play as. Racing on foot has never been this fun. Wait, it's never been fun... Well, this Makes it fun! You can play this game both casually with friends, and competitively with anyone. Learning the physics of this game and it's crazy tricks raises the skill ceiling so much higher! You can play ranked with people of your skill level, or jump into a quick match and have just as much fun grappling and kicking off walls to your leisure. There's even a single player story mode, with unlockable comic book chapters! Not to mention, this game's soundtrack and art style makes it feel all the more like you're inside a comic book! While many players buy this game on sale and give up early, this game is most definitely not dead, and seeing its success and competitive scene, won't ever die. This game is simple fun for absolutely anyone! Grapple far and hit slopes hard, runners! This game is amazing, and I'd recommend it for anyone who likes any sort of platformer game!

1030	1	a	  I found it a bit repetitive, but it's fun. It's pretty much just a simple running race game: you're just running, level after level, grabbing your opponents with hooks, throwing boxes at them and using special powers to prevent them from crossing the finish line before you.

1034	1	a	My favourite game at the moment. Easy to play, hard to master (perfectly) everyone can more or less move to the whole map without any experience. But there are so many alternative ways where you can go to be faster.   Good game to watch videos nextby. The Power-Ups are just amazing!   The only thing that I dislike are the characters, which I think could look a bit cooler.  Also I have some minor lags sometimes (once in an hour), which is quite weird, because my pc is a lot over the requirements.  Cool local-co-up game!   Wow that was a unorganised review.   - 9/10 Riggy

There is a tutorial and you can play against bots to get better. Pretty much everyone in the community that I've played against in MP were really cool and willing to 'show me the ropes'. This is a fantastic game and is super addictive. You've been warned lol. Get this game!

1092	1	a	That game can make the time you spend playing it fun and pretty interesting. That was a unique experience playing that game. I liked it, the game has a fine graphic and good gameplay, the soundtrack is cool.
1094	1	a	SpeedRunners is one of the most fantastic small titles available on steam, as a multiplayer game it's one of the most fantastic around. The gameplay is extremely fun the overall concept is pretty different and it has a good amount of gimmicks to practise and learn to get an upper hand. It's very fun and I haven't had so much fun since that first night playing with a group of friends. Recently announced is a level editor too which will also be a fantastic edition to an already great game. High recommend.
1096	1	a	This is one of those games you turn on, play a couple of matches then wake up behind a Mcdonald's counter with bodies lyring all over the floor and a firetruck crashed through the main window. a quick, hilariously fun game i promise you you'll not be dissapointed with this rage-generator.

1134	1	a	Speedrunners is a game that can build or destroy friendships. Mostly destroying tho. You can only become better by practicing and when everybody is good at the game, it's an amazing experience. Or you can annoy the f*ck out of your friends by playing way better than them. It's always fun when they rage and call you a hacker instead of admitting that you are way to good at the game.   Aaah... nothing better than watching your friends suffer.

1216	1	a	People told me before I bought it that this game is a Mario Kart in 2D.  They were totally right. I used to play a lot of Mario Kart Wii when I was younger and got better and better at it with each race I did.   SpeedRunners works a lot in the same way. You'll pass through the same levels over and over again, but you'll always find a new technique to go faster or trick your opponents.   With time, you'll get better and better, and after a few hundred hours, you'll be as skilled as the hundreds of other good players out there. All it takes is some practice.  I love this game. It's so fun and interesting, especially the multiplayer. :3

1222	1	a	Pros: - Fun - More fun - Rewarding chaos with friends  Cons: - You might have no friendships afterwards  Is there anything I can say about this game that isn't just the word fun? It's probably one of my favourite games to play. It's not a game I would play solo, but it's very rewarding to play with friends. Although it can be very difficult when your friends are better than you, it brings out this fun side of competition where anything can happen.

1304	1	a	A good concept with decent game play. I don't think it's worth it's stated price but it's still in early access. Time will only tell! My hope is that they add some mini-game functions or attempt to play with the rules of the game. (This game is local co-op)!  Speed Runners is a game about running the fastest, being first while leaving your enemies in the dust. By being last, you risk the chance of being eliminated by being off the edge of the screen. The  gameplay  itself for the moment is decently good but has a lot -First player controls the pace and controls the camera. Take the long route or risk grabbing a pick-up may cost you a life. The scoring system as of current requires three wins. This means you need to win three times in order to take the game. You do not need to win consecutively to win the game. There are about a handful of characters to choose from at the moment. Some characters are available to unlock while others are DLC's. All character designs are quite unique and all move differently from one another. I haven't noticed any significant diversity in speed between the characters.   More or less, all characters seem to jump just as high as one another and move as fast as one another. Is this a good thing? Depends. It offers a level playing field for everyone but mixing up the game is never a bad idea. One person may prefer speed while another may prefer brawn. The only issue I have so far is that players are not able to melee or hit one another without a power up. Sure, this may be good as people aren't whacking one another always but some players I have played with mentioned that a melee addition would make it more engaging. Nonetheless, the game is still enjoyable and power ups provide a great addition to the game. Some of the power ups included are a grappling hook to grab the nearest opponent that pulls them back and you forward, boxes that opponents can run into, a force ball that completely slows and pushes opponents and a homing rocket missile (just to name a few).   Levels themselves are quite challenging and take a bit of time to get used to and really good at. It is a bit overwhelming at first playing online and getting completely smoked by veteran players. If one's really persistent on getting good, it does take a little grinding to familiarize yourself with the level design.  Visuals  are quite simple and suit the games needs. It's not over the edge 3D but the graphics do fit the atmosphere. I wouldn't mind seeing a little more done in regards to animations or things happening in the background. Heck, why not have players influence some of the backgrounds/graphics. Why not even have them alter the stage? This is possible to a certain extent as levers are present throughout levels. These levers open and close paths and definitely add some more interest to the game.  Sounds  are pretty decent at this point and aren't extremely varied character to character. Dialogue is slightly different but wouldn't hurt to add a few more sounds to the voices.   Overall, not a bad game in it's current form. There is a lot of opportunity here to take the game beyond being a simple linear running game. Although be it so, there's some serious fun to have online or between your buddies. I'm really, really, really hoping they add some mini-games or some more diversity into the game. They got a nice engine, let's do more with it!  Indie Rating : 7.6/10  EARLY ACCESS RATING : 6.95/10       Gameplay   C+     Story / Campaign   N/A     Visuals / User Interface   B-     Sounds / Music   C+     Replay-ability   B-     Overall    C+      PS - Why can't you take in-game screenshots with F12?

1484	1	a	This game is definitely worth a buy. The community is small, and the devs dont really update the game either, but that doesnt mean this game is one to be overlooked. On top of its already challenging story mode, there are lots of ways to challenge yourself against bots, or other players, even both! So, if you're thinking about getting this, please do! See you out there SpeedRunner!

1488	1	a	I'm going to preface this by saying that I've only played through the story mode, but I feel like that actually captures the essene of what the game is, if not the entire spirit of it.  I first purchased SpeedRunners as a sort of replacement for Runbow. I didn't want to have to plug my Wii in all the time to just play one game. Why not just buy a new running game, and let my litle black box gather more dust and grow more and more redundant in peace?  The game is hectic. Chaotic. Deliightfully retro. There were many times I was mere milliseconds away from an untimely elimination, only to boost and swing just right and propel myself to a dashing finish. Oher times I was not so lucky, and was left groaning in annoyance and even frustration. I can only imagine how that would look with three other people playing on the couch, too. Probably a party.  Long story short: buy it. It's a good time, even on your own. It only gets better from there.

1562	1	a	One of my favorite games. Must buy.
1564	1	a	I have only had this game for about a week but i can allready say it is amazing, even though its looks like an average side scroller it is far from it. the art style is beautiful and overall it is a very fun and competive game to play which never gets old. An amazing original idea which works incredibly well. i would definatly recomand it to anyone that is looking for somthing new play or just to play in your spare time either way its a great buy.

1702	1	a	SpeedRunners - My personal review  I bought this game in the official steam shop after it was mentioned in one of PewDiePie´s slightly older videos. It has been reduced by 75% from the original price so I payed about 4 euros in total, at this point my expectations weren´t that high so I first thought that i´d spend about 20 hours in the game. After a few matches and when i started to figure out the special mechanics that the game has it really started getting interesting and fun to play. Now I spent 46 hours in the game and that after about 6 weeks of buying it and after all this time its stil enjoyable and on top of that it became one of my favourite games i´ve ever played.  It is a jump n´run multiplayer game without any type of story you need to mention, so there is a tutorial but the game is just about the gameplay and not about the graphics or the campaign. You shouldn´t buy this game if you´re looking for a revolutionary game in every point but if you´re into games like this its definetly worth youre money although i have to say that you should wait until its getting reduced again. 
1704	1	a	Ive only played this game for a bit, but I know its fantastic! The graphics are great and everythings fluent. All the characters are interesting and really make you want to play them! Its not a pay to play game! Everything you buy just effects how it looks and not how its played, to be good you must play! The soundtrack fits the tone of the fast paced, cut-throat gameplay! All the sound effects are great and really immerse you! I hate long reviews so ill keep it short. The game is fast paced, fun to play, cut throat and with every victory your friends will hate you more and more! Mentioning hate, Ive sseen NONE of it in the games ive played, everyone is nice and fair with each loss, and complementary with each victory! Worth. Every. Penny.

1780	1	a	I seriously looked at this game a while ago and thought it wouldn't be interesting. A couple friends and I decided to buy the game and check it out and 4 hours later we had some of the best fun in a LONG time. It's basically a fast-paced platforming game with powerups to hinder your friends (or foes) from beating you. The catch is after one person 'dies' by falling off the screen, the screen begins to get smaller and smaller until it's small enough to barely fit 2 people. It's some of the best fun you'll have and I can guarantee you'll be angry and laughing at the same time.

1918	1	a	think of Mario Kart think of your friend 2 feet away from the finish line think of that blue shell you launched, floating just above their head think of the sheer anger on their face as you steal that gold cup from their fingertips  this is far more intense and friendship breaking than that! rockets, grapples, cheeky tackles that any ref would have no trouble red carding!  one of the most FUN games in a long time, LAN PLAY + 4 FRIENDS = LAUGHTER, TEARS AND AT LEAST 1 BLACK EYE HIGHLYHIGHLY RECOMMEND
1920	1	a	It's a side scrolling racer where the object isn't to finish laps ahead of your opponents, but instead only to get far enough ahead of your opponents to push them off the screen to their explosive death. It's got a bronze/silver age comic book feel to the aesthetic. It reminds me of the racing game included with Kirby Super Star.

1930	1	a	Just recently getting into this game, I'll never be good enough to beat the veterans online, and maybe not even my friends - but I still enjoy every second of it.  Great stylized graphics (seriously, just watch someone else play and pay attention to the level artwork in the background). A catchy big band soundtrack that's totally unique. Snappy gameplay that allows you to get better, inches at a time.  The most fun you can have with this is to start playing along with three friends who haven't played before. Figure out the game mechanics together and accept your defeats gracefully.

That said, it is not worth the regular price because: A: VERY limited story-mode B: Like ZERO DLCs C: Community is somewhat small so it can take forever to get put in a game D: Because of sed reason (^), you have newer players stuck in online matches with players 10x as good Again, I love the game and it's fun and easy to learn—But it could benefit from a lower price and more DLCs

2072	1	a	SpeedRunners is as if Mario Kart and Super Meat Boy had a baby. It's a fast paced platforming race where you knock your opponents out with items found on the track, going off-screen results in death, and the last person alive wins the race.  I'm not a multiplayer person at all, but I enjoy playing this competitively in ranked mode, or casually with friends. To my knowledge, there is no other game like this, so I would recommend this title to anyone who enjoys platforming games.

2264	1	a	SpeedRunners is one of the most fantastic small indie titles available on steam, as a multiplayer game it's one of the most fantastic around. The gameplay is extremely fun, the overall concept is pretty different and it has a good amount of gimmicks to practice and learn to get an upper hand.  Metacritic: 84 / 100 Metascore 8.2 / 10 User Score

2290	1	a	Fantastic couch co-op game. I've played many hours with friends and it's always a blast. Fast-paced, intense and competitive. I would thoroughly recommend it.
2292	1	a	This game is a great game for parties (You can play local with controllers for twice the fun). This game can and cant be competitive you decide. Sadly you need gamers to play this game if you are a gamer yourself this is because you absolutely smash them XD (If you like teasing and killing plebs this is the game for you!!!!)

2304	1	a	 the ranked game matchmaking is so trash that it doesn't work.  i'm beginner league, rank 2 (doesn't really fit for me honestly, because i joined in late), and i get paired with someone 3-4 ranks above me.  i lose most of the time of course, but even when i lose i gain ELO.  also half the time the 'winning moves' are really just exploits that weren't really planned to be used in the orginal map   pros:  - fun racing game with friends. - skill impacts (WAY) more than RNG, item drops. - made it out of early access, i guess that's kind of a pro.  cons:  - camera is literally so attrocious, it's a joke. and because the camera matters in win/lose situations, it's kind of a key element, and doesn't really pair well when ♥♥♥♥ed in the other direction. - (VERY) easilly exploited. - matchmaking works half the time. - limited gameplay. - you can gain and lose ELO from playing workshop maps in ranked, which aren't usually played for obvious reasons, and to add insult to injury, you don't even gain XP from playing these maps in non-competitive modes. please remove workshop maps from ranked pool. - very small base of players (&lt;750 when i play, peak is usually 800).  is it a bad game? not entirely, more like a 'the community makes it bad' kinda game. it's definately worth the money, if it's on sale. also, if you don't have friends to play it with, it'll be way less fun.   are more cons than pros a bad thing? not always. like i said, friends make this game 10x more fun.  beta was a blast, release was somewhat underwhelming, and still kinda feels like a beta game, with several bugs.

2794	1	a	Hello! Speedrunners Is a really good game for a party or if you just want to play a small game where you can stop (almost) instantly. It is really handy if you want to make a decision for example you want to decide wich game you play the guy who wins chooses the game. 4 pack recommended but if you want to play online it's also fun because you can rank up. And the developers are interested in your experience for example map making contest!

3024	1	a	SpeedRunners is a competitive indie racing game with a 2-D artstyle and a fun soundtrack. It has both single player and multiplayer modes and a variety of fun characters with different personalities. The goal of the game is to knock out your enemies by making them hit the edges of the screen, and you can race through a variety of unique levels with an arsenal of items to do so. This game is pure addictive multiplayer chaos. It's fast paced, it's competitive, and it even has a story! I see this game as a must-have if you're into indie games and is a joy to play with your friends.

3058	1	a	This game is a good game for a beta its has some bugs but it is just a beta anyway i wouldnt say its a racing game its more of a skill based game but I would recommend it.    Edit: That was then, this is now. The game has developed very quickly, and is much better then it was, and still would recomend it.

3314	1	a	SpeedRunners is not a good consistent day after day game. However it has a lot of replay value, in the sense that you and your friends can return to the game every so often and still have fun. Speedrunners may seem simple at face value but there can be a bit of complexity to it.   Final thoughts:  - BUY THE GAME - If you want a good party game to play once in a while. - DO NOT BUY - If you want a game to play everyday.

3364	1	a	This game made me realize that my dream of being a small blue hedgehog was unrealistic. I never knew a game could ruin my life. This combined with the realization that Russians are cancer ( that dream was crushed by csgo), made me want to end it all.

3604	1	a	The community is what makes this game the most fun., mostly fun in the lower ranks, and maybe overly competetive in the upper ranks. I'd play it more if I had more folks who'd play locally. This is similar but maybe less inviting than Mario Kart. It requires seasoned players some patience and grace to make this game fun for anyone who is playing for their first time.

I've played for nearly 200 hours and there is still nowhere to go but up! Has excellent workshop support with user created maps being curated and played competitively and the pool expanding constantly!
3616	1	a	An awesome party-with-friends game to play with your best buddies, with a large learn curve and a lot of strategy involved.  10/10 would grapple your friends again and screw them aha  Ps: Feels so good when you dodge a grapple doe, especially from your nemesis ahaha

3620	1	a	The biggest fear I had when playing this game was that I wouldn't be able to control it well. Platform games are a dime a dozen, but one of my biggest banes is always wall jumping. Even in this game, I have trouble wall jumping sometimes.   But never have I had so much fun messing around with a platformer game. First try, maybe you won't do so well, but you'll have a great time playing and figuring it out with friends. Then you'll play again, and again, and with every match you'll be getting better and better at it. But even messing up all the time is one of the funniest parts. Everybody will do it.   I also have to praise the levels. There's a lot going on and you always feel cool when you manage to pull off the perfect swing around a corner or dodge every obstacle in an area. There's levels for beginners and advanced players and there's not stress when playing with your friends on harder levels because the fun of the levels is messing up until you get the hang of it.   This is by far one of the best multiplayer games I've played. Great style, interesting and fun gameplay: all in all a very great game.  Edit: Years later and I still hold the same opinion for this game. While it does have some glitchiness here and there, it is incredibly fun (even when you lose) and heavily skill-based. If you want to win, you need to get good- and it's fun practicing in order to get good. Play on some workshop levels for some extra hectic fun times.

My housemate can testify, there was much screaming and crying over the Theme Park level.   Took me for freaking ever to get the hang of those wall climbs. A controller helps and not thinking too hard, just go with the momentum and you'll somehow get through all the F**King wall climbs and F**King boxes.   But you'll  WANT  too. You'll  NEED  too. It's addictive and fast and relatively simple to pick up. I like the way the 'story' is told in the cartoons, but I wish the text-dialogue was more than just hints on how to play. It's coloured brightly (but not eyeball-searingly) and the slick little animations make it super entertaining to watch. I am hooked. Not grappled, though.   I might not be able to climb but I can DODGE  8/10 would make Piccolo proud again

4432	1	a	0/10 not fast enough -ign  SpeedRunners is a competitive multiplayer game in which players 'race' around courses using grappling hooks, powerups, and sliding. The goal is simple. Knock all players off the screen 3 times in a row to win.   Speedrunners is truely fast paced. Whilst I have not played the campaign mode yet, I don't think the story is or would be too appealing, and that's perfectly okay with me.  Holy shinoa the artstyle. The game has a sort of comic book or cartoon type of feel, and every level's design has something fresh and new for the formula. Not to mention, this game has integrated Workshop support, allowing any joe-schmo to make very complicated or stupidly easy levels.  God diggity doozle these controls. The controls are amazingly tight and are perfect in competitive modes. If you mess up, that's you.  Overall, Speedrunners is worth every cent. I could not find any flaw and if you want to have a good time with friends, do yourself a favor and buy this.  My (True) rating: 10/10

5894	1	a	Some of the most fun I have had with my friends and brother. I have had such tense races and had a lot of funny moments. I've definitely gotten my moneys worth, especially because I got it on sale for like, a dollar. I would definitely recomend this game. You wont be disapointed..
5896	1	a	White Cat runs faster.
5898	1	a	This game is fun, I love pushing people off the screen.
5900	1	a	Enjoyable multiplayer game with friends. It's fast, exciting, and competitive. It's fun with friends has a decent amount of characters and maps to keep it varied
5902	1	a	Great party game. You have to play Story mode to unlock new characters. It's a good online/local multiplayer game.

5926	1	a	I hate this game 10/10 How do i play?
5928	1	a	I became a Golden Hooker 10/10 would hook again.
5930	1	a	SpeedRunners is a fun side-scrolling game that makes me think that Indie developers could do a lot better. (No hate pls.) Cons- -No one currently plays on the multiplayer -The only DLC is youtuber DLC Pros -Works for bad computers on medium settings -The fact that this game has no flaws except for the DLC.
5932	1	a	Its a great game but it crashes when I try to change character :(
5934	1	a	Fun to play with friends at shools/jobs or were you are
5936	1	a	Ran it so hard even my best friend overdosed on speed
5938	1	a	To me, this game is only fun when playing with a full lobby of friends.
5940	1	a	Speedrunners is exactly what it advertises: a cutthroat multiplayer running race where your only goal is to outrun everyone else. Mechanically, this game is pretty well made. Everything is predictable enough to where intense strategy can be employed in every map, and the simplisity of the mechanics allow for clever tricks to be hidden all over the place to maximize your velocity and ensure that you're speeding away to the top.  That's not the reason I decided to post a positive review though. The mechanics and gameplay are very fun, but because it's (pretty much) multiplayer only, it's the players that make or break it for me. And the community is actually pretty cool for the most part. Firstly, the ranking system is ♥♥♥♥ed and everybody knows it. That's a point against the game. But the community makes up for it by understanding when players aren't as skilled as them and oftentimes encouraging them or even giving them a helpful hand in figuring out how to become speedy.   So in conclusion, great game, awesome community. Game is definately worth it.

6006	1	a	Good for spending your free time... Realy recommend playing with friends, because for me it can get pretty boring playing alone... *maybe getting it while the game is on sale ???
6008	1	a	multiplayer at its best
6010	1	a	Never wanted to kill all of my friends more then i do when i play this game!
6012	1	a	Unaxpected, yet really entertaining and well crafted. The game is simple: race against other in platformish levels to be the first. Meanwhile you will use lot of props to power up your character or stop the others. The thing that set the game apart is the 2D physics engine, the sleekness and polishness in the interface, and the good balance of the game. Also: it has a great kind community that, in my experience, tend to help the noob with words of advice, instead of bashing on his head :)

6138	1	a	0/10 not fast enough -ign  SpeedRunners is a competitive multiplayer game in which players 'race' around courses using grappling hooks, powerups, and sliding. The goal is simple. Knock all players off the screen 3 times in a row to win.   Speedrunners is truely fast paced. Whilst I have not played the campaign mode yet, I don't think the story is or would be too appealing, and that's perfectly okay with me.  Holy shinoa the artstyle. The game has a sort of comic book or cartoon type of feel, and every level's design has something fresh and new for the formula. Not to mention, this game has integrated Workshop support, allowing any joe-schmo to make very complicated or stupidly easy levels.  God diggity doozle these controls. The controls are amazingly tight and are perfect in competitive modes. If you mess up, that's you.  Overall, Speedrunners is worth every cent. I could not find any flaw and if you want to have a good time with friends, do yourself a favor and buy this.  My (True) rating: 10/10
6140	1	a	A fast paced game that is great to play with friends.
6142	1	a	'Graphics: Your toaster'  It's a good game.
6144	1	a	Its fun!

6812	1	a	i found this game by watching some youtubers and i thought that it looked like a good amount of fun, however i didnt have much money so i was a bit hesitant to buy it. After a couple of months i recieved a notification that the game was free for the weekend so epople could try it out. after about 10 hours in two days i bought the game the moment the trial ended. its an absolutely great game which i have never regretted buying because it has gameplay which is always entertaning. whether you're struggling to keep up with a pro, slowing down for a noob or having an intense match with someone on par you can always have a laugh about the result. And probably one of the greatest hings about this game is the community, this game gets nowhere near the same amount of toxic players as other games, almost all of the players are friendly happy people (i honestly believe that in all of my time playing i've only come across 10 toxic players and 1 bot). as a result i could not recommend this game enough and encourage you to get it as soon a you can.  I look forward to seeing you on the race track.

6816	1	a	'My Golden Grapple will be the end of you, Speedrunner!'   No, Gil. No it won't. THOSE F**KING WALL CLIMBS WILL BE. O M F G.   My housemate can testify, there was much screaming and crying over the Theme Park level.   Took me for freaking ever to get the hang of those wall climbs. A controller helps and not thinking too hard, just go with the momentum and you'll somehow get through all the F**King wall climbs and F**King boxes.   But you'll  WANT  too. You'll  NEED  too. It's addictive and fast and relatively simple to pick up. I like the way the 'story' is told in the cartoons, but I wish the text-dialogue was more than just hints on how to play. It's coloured brightly (but not eyeball-searingly) and the slick little animations make it super entertaining to watch. I am hooked. Not grappled, though.   I might not be able to climb but I can DODGE  8/10 would make Piccolo proud again

7462	1	a	It is fun, and can get a bit frustrating.   *UPDATE MAY 2016*  A few years went by, got myself a gaming pc, and a controller, and started to play this again. I now remember how fun this is, very smooth, nice levels, and i like the OST. Bought this back when it was still Early Access, and TinyBuild has not given up on this game.

7498	1	a	A great fun game if you want to play casual with your friends or a challenging and harsh experience if you'd rather dive into the competitive aspect. It's worth of your time if you enjoy fast-paced games with quick matches. Recommended
7500	1	a	A return to what games are supposed to be, addictive and just fun.  Speedrunners is a wonderful return to the fun platforming days of the NES. This is a quick to learn, yet difficult to master game that is simply just fun to play, and can be enjoyed in just a few minutes.   Essentially, the crux of the game is to just run and beat your competitors by being the last one still running. However, there is much the game and other players can throw at you to insure that is not always as simple as it sounds.  Gameplay is a wonderful mash-up of old-school NES platformers. Gameplay can best be described as a mix of Super Metroid, Bionic Commando and Mario Kart all rolled into one. You and three other racers (bots, online or even local games) charge through dozens of different levels jumping, ducking, sliding, avoiding boxes, swinging on grappling hooks, and shooting different weapons at other racers. In addition, the screen itself starts to slowly get smaller and you must maximize your speed and minimize mistakes. Game winners are determined by whoever wins three rounds first, and rounds themselves are over quickly, this is a great game to play if you can only dedicate a little time to gaming.   This is a fantastic game that I recommend to all.

7512	1	a	It's what it says in the title, watch 10 seconds of gameplay and you get the premise. It's my thing so I like it, I know a lot of people who hate it.
7514	1	a	Its a really fun and fast paced 4 player game. Very fun with friends but online play is also good.
7516	1	a	Ran it so hard even my best friend overdosed on speed
7518	1	a	As someone who's a fan of both platforming games and racing games, I think SpeedRunners is a fantastic combination of both genres. It's kinda like classic 2D Sonic the Hedgehog with Mario Kart items, and it's hella fun. However, the online multiplayer experience suffers greatly from really bad desync issues. In a game that depends so heavily on the players' positions on the screen, it seems like it would be really important to have everyone's games synchronized, especially in ranked multiplayer.
7520	1	a	This game was so fun! You can see a let's play by me here -         YouTube™ Video:  SpeedRunners - Ep.1 - I'm A Bad Batman!&nbsp;

7534	1	a	  the only thing this game is missing is a fail compilation
7536	1	a	Got 2 go fast
7538	1	a	Good old arcade fun, even better with friends This game is a fun fast paced party game with.... wait for it..... ACTUAL LOCAL COOP. Plus an incredible amount of replayability, great online and system requirements wich are low enough for somebody with a bad computer. PICK THIS UP ASAP you won't regret it
7540	1	a	PROS: -SUPER fun game! Either ranked or unranked, you will have fun, trust me! -Has ranked and unranked modes -Community is very very very nice 99% of the time. -No hackers -Very few smurfs to ruin your experience (1%, maybe?)  CONS: -Matchmaking system is pretty bad. You can go against people a LOT better than you. If you are in entry league (lowest rank), you might end up playing against silver league players (that's high) -Can get pretty frustrating if you are going against people much better than you in ranked (but if that's the case, just go ahead and play unranked .-.). -Community is small and probably will be until the devs decide to lower the price of the game.  8/10 Would DEFINITELY recommend speeedrunners

7548	1	a	My favorite game of the year!  This game seems simplistic at first but after a while, I discovered that the controls are soooo deep! You can literally spend hundred of hours perfecting your skills and you could still improve.  My favorite aspect is the weapons available. It feel a bit like Mario Kart and I love it!  The only thing I dislike is that workshop maps are part of the official ranked mode. The game should offer 2 different ranked mode: 1-Officials 2-Workshops  BUY THIS GAME

7564	1	a	Never picked up a game so quickly and been hooked.  10/10, would Unic again.
7566	1	a	Speedrunners is exactly what it advertises: a cutthroat multiplayer running race where your only goal is to outrun everyone else. Mechanically, this game is pretty well made. Everything is predictable enough to where intense strategy can be employed in every map, and the simplisity of the mechanics allow for clever tricks to be hidden all over the place to maximize your velocity and ensure that you're speeding away to the top.  That's not the reason I decided to post a positive review though. The mechanics and gameplay are very fun, but because it's (pretty much) multiplayer only, it's the players that make or break it for me. And the community is actually pretty cool for the most part. Firstly, the ranking system is ♥♥♥♥ed and everybody knows it. That's a point against the game. But the community makes up for it by understanding when players aren't as skilled as them and oftentimes encouraging them or even giving them a helpful hand in figuring out how to become speedy.   So in conclusion, great game, awesome community. Game is definately worth it.

7652	1	a	this game is fun, but it will be better if you can make this game more popular. I mean i cant even find any continent area on night or day. I always play with 200-400 ping, you think its fun?? no srsly
7654	1	a	lots of fun
7656	1	a	Takes tons of practice. You usually get matched with people who are alot better than you. While you may get dicouraged and think you have no chance against them, just watch how they move and try to replicate it.

7938	1	a	A fast paced game that is great to play with friends.
7940	1	a	This game is fun and fast paced with it's variety of characters, weapons, and many workshop maps.  It also has a ranked system if your into that jazz &amp; a level up system that unlocks skin varieties and new characters.   It also has secret codes for new characters - YOU CAN BE A POTATO   If you and your friends are looking for a game to tear you friend ship apart with very frustrating races. Go for it.

7974	1	a	real good 
7976	1	a	Best game ever. Had lots of laughts with friends. Highly recommend it :D
7978	1	a	Super fun game to play among friends and strangers! It gets pretty competitive a times as well.  One thing I hate about it is that there a few people playing this game, I hope there will be more players in the future for online matchmaking. Maybe make this game more accessible for all types of people, and allow players (veterans) who payed for this game have benefits, like exclusive skins, in-game. Overall, this is a pretty good game. I'll give it a 7/10 because finding other players online takes a long time, plus the background music gets repetitive at times.
7980	1	a	10/10 best game of its kind, if you like this check out duck game. XD
7982	1	a	Really fun with friends and intense in ranked
7984	1	a	Was so fast, my eyes saw out of the monitor.  10/10 will play in hologram monitor again

8028	1	a	Much friend many wow.    On a more serious note: This game is on of the funnest local multiplayer and online games I have ever played. All you need is a friend and a controller. It has steam workshop activated so you cn download user created maps. The grappling is amazing and you are basically god when you get the perfect swing. 10/10 would bang again         metaphorically

8034	1	a	Fun to play with friends at shools/jobs or were you are
8036	1	a	Fantastic fun. Great party game either local/online. Easy to pickup, satisfyingly difficult to master. Definitely deserves it's own pro following!
8038	1	a	Very satisfying animations, great gameplay. Makes me wanna come back and play this game everyday!
8040	1	a	Seriously love this game. Great multiplayer, solid single player, good bots, community support for level creation and sharing. A solid game, and if it's on sale, a definitely buy!
8042	1	a	Definietly a game to play with a few friends when they're over, fun and casual, if you're not sure about purchasing just wait for a sale.
8044	1	a	Fast paced, Challenging, and definitly Rage inducing. This is a great game for someone who wants to test their skill in momentum, timing, and SPEED. Online Multiplayer is rage inducing but if you pay attention you will learn soemthing 
8046	1	a	  Awesome addicting game, check out our story mode!         SpeedRunners!&nbsp;
8048	1	a	It is fun, and can get a bit frustrating.   *UPDATE MAY 2016*  A few years went by, got myself a gaming pc, and a controller, and started to play this again. I now remember how fun this is, very smooth, nice levels, and i like the OST. Bought this back when it was still Early Access, and TinyBuild has not given up on this game.
8050	1	a	  Fun Fast Running (Triping) Action! Very addciting with friends.

8060	1	a	 Early Access Review
8062	1	a	Really awesome game!!! It is a really fun game with friends and playable on the controller too. There are many Character to unlock plus if ya really like the game like me i would pick up a cool trail for one buck. :D
8064	1	a	It's a lot like like Micro Machines, but as a platformer instead of a racing game. It's also exceptionally good, considering the price! It's really one of those games where it's not EXCEPTIONAL, but you can't not recommend, because you know everyone would like it and it's well worth the cost.
8066	1	a	Broke my keyboard for the 3rd time. very very good game
8068	1	a	this game is fun, but it will be better if you can make this game more popular. I mean i cant even find any continent area on night or day. I always play with 200-400 ping, you think its fun?? no srsly
8070	1	a	I LOVE this game it's so incredibly fun and fast-paced I find it hard to put down the controller 10/10 would definitely reccomend
8072	1	a	Super fun!!! Controls are a little weird though.
8074	1	a	THIS GAME SUCKED ♥♥♥♥
8076	1	a	Good! i must run faster than another player! i must concetration too!! better if play online with friends!
8078	1	a	Lot's of fun until none of your friends want to play with you anymore because you keep winning D:
8080	1	a	Easy to learn, hard to master, fast-paced platforming bliss. Oh, there's also Bionic Commando-style grappling hooks, Mario Kart-style item pickups, and Meat Boy-style 'any mistakes are your own' controls. If you've ever enjoyed a platformer before, there's no reason for you to not buy this game.
8082	1	a	Great game, easy to learn and although it is a bit glichy (still in beta) it still is great to pick up and play! Never gets boring with a bunch of workshop levels to play when your tired of the originals plus, local 2 player! (controler)
8084	1	a	Play faster faster faster faster faster Faster I said God Damnit FASTER '''!!!'!'!' Kill the animals
8086	1	a	very fun a spped based game with some timing thrown in.
8088	1	a	'Easy points' - Adam Sloss
8090	1	a	So i'm only silver league but i've been playing this game for nearly 2 years and heres my honest opinion: I have always loved this game and it was such an exiting, enjoyable and competative experience. But since its released most of the few good Australian players stopped playing, or at least arent as active as they used to. This makes at least in my case very difficult to find a game at all. Let alone being evenly matched. Gameplay whise this game opens up so much room for skill developement and the constant strive to be the best. With the limited singleplayer replay value this pushes most players to the online area of Speedrunners. Online can be very pleasant and fun to play whether it be playing with some old mates or making new ones by yourself everyone on there seems to be mature and friendly. As the online connection is P2P (No servers), one person with faulty internet can pretty much ruin the experience of everyone else as it breaks the game most the time and you end up frozen in a game. Recently with the games release they have introduced trails for people to buy with microtransactions, this really felt out of place with the whole arcade style of the game and I have rarely seen people using them. Alltogether this is quite an amazing fun to play game, I reccomend buying a 4 pack and gifting it around as it is best played with friends!
8092	1	a	i more of a FastWalker myself. 5000/10000
8094	1	a	Good Game 10/10 Would Buy Again.
8096	1	a	Really fun and competitive I think it is better when you have friends to play it with so if you have a friend who owns this game then I think it is a must have.

8112	1	a	Best game! recomended to buy n try this game!
8114	1	a	If there's one thing that I absolutely love about this game, is that despite its learning curve can be a bit steep in terms of finding the flow of the map and then exploiting it to your advantage and then some, is that this game despite it's minimalistic look has so many moving parts that just make this work in all the right places!  Story mode is basically your standard fare fluff that shows you how the mechanics of the game work as well as getting the opportunity to unlock characters along the way as well as extra features, plus a handful of characters you can snag as DLC. In terms of animation quality, it looks like something out of your typical Saturday Morning cartoon, complete with all the cheese you can handle in terms of dialogue. But when it comes race time, it gets ruthless and in a big hurry, so you pretty much have to pull out all of the stops in order to not only keep the pace, but to also take out the competition along the way.  But what happens when you're all done with the story? Well, there's multiplayer, which you can set up a match between your friends, take on bots at different skill levels or if you're feeling brave enough, you can take on the world in ranked matchups to determine who's the fastest of them all. And the best part is, anyone who you come across are all about as skilled as you are, some may have more skill than you, but it's never unfair and evevryone is out to win as badly as you do.  In short, if you wanna win, you gotta git gud, scrub. And this is coming from someone who hasn't broke out of Entry League yet.  But in all seriousness, do I recommend this game? Sure, I do! It's perfect for those get-togethers and who want to have some fast-paced fun that may end up ruining some friendships along the way, so I wouldn't play local multiplayer unless if you're looking for a few black eyes and bloody noses.

8122	1	a	If you are calm person like me. You will never ever be calm person again after playing this game.
8124	1	a	Simply put, this game is a blast to play with friends. It's essentially 2D on-foot Mario Kart, and anyone who has ever playd and loved a kart racing game will love this too!
8126	1	a	  This game was gifted to me by a friend. It\'s a really fun play former with sharp controls and laughable characters. It\'s a ton of fun playing with someone you know so you can shout insults at each other. Another neat thing is you can play local coop along with online coop which is freaking awesome.
8128	1	a	amazing game and very fun worth every penny :D
8130	1	a	Amazing game 10/10 i personally made Maps/Trails that me and my friends have fun with the only thing is the rankings in MatchMaking Which Puts me with a player 2 leagues above me :)
8132	1	a	This is an incredibly fun game that is great for couch co-op
8134	1	a	  At the time I wrote this review, I obtained it through family sharing. I have now purchased this game.  this game is wonderful. active community, great maps, exellent soundtrack (please make us able to buy the ost, i'll buy) and the gameplay? PERFECT! It's got that mario kart feeling, where even if you're 2good4quickmatch (there's a great ranked mode), you still fear for your life cuz you know that one pleb behind you might find out he has the golden claw equipped (which is like a blue shell, but more vicious), and that alone can f*ck you up real good. the items are diverse, and most of them have drawbacks (badly timed bombs can boost the ennemy, the blue sh- i mean golden claw makes you stop running when used, ect.). recently, they added trails (appears when running 2fast), i don't mind them, but some are obnoxiously large, and can distract you. (small edit: there's now an option to hide the trails)  Most content (appart from trails, i think) are locked through leveling, which i think could maybe be earned faster? (pun not itended) they also added dlc, which adds characters based on popular youtubers (ex: PewDiePie, Markiplier, ect.) and yea it's cool  as a final verdict, i rate this 5/7 (joke)  EDIT: Heard of the g 2a key fiasco. they take revenues from tinybuild, and it ain't fair. I'll buy this game ASAP, and please buy games from official sellers, like steam.
8136	1	a	really fun better with freinds but still really cool if you play muilti    (P.S please make mor secrets thank you .3. ^3^)
8138	1	a	Turned on te game, went super speed on the second race i played 10/10 would go super speed agian
8140	1	a	nah,its fun game but got bored pretty fast
8142	1	a	Great party game. You have to play Story mode to unlock new characters. It's a good online/local multiplayer game.
8144	1	a	SpeedRunners, an extremely fun 2D racing game where you can use powerups and hooks to get an advantage. This is one of, if not the best racing game I have ever played. It is however, one of those games that is best experienced with friends. The AI can both be amazing and complete morons leading to alot of frustration. I would recommend this anyone who would like to play a fast paced game with 1 - 3 other people.  The Good: Art Style  Pacing  Powerup Mechanics  The Meh: AI  Music *(Just my preference)  The Bad: Can't think of any true game based issues, only experienced one or two bugs.  Update #1 (Fixed alto to alot)
8146	1	a	this is the best game in the 'unic'verse . that was a pun
8148	1	a	Honestly one of the best games ive played great mutiplayer awesome with friends great
8150	1	a	  Nice game with friends on sofa, lots of fun.
8152	1	a	Great game, easy to learn and although it is a bit glichy (still in beta) it still is great to pick up and play! Never gets boring with a bunch of workshop levels to play when your tired of the originals plus, local 2 player! (controler)
8154	1	a	Fun rage game. Right Customizable? Right Has a workshop page? Right Has DLC? Right 4/4 good game
8156	1	a	Chicken Man 10/10 would run again.
8158	1	a	This game is fantastic to play with a group of friends, especially when knowing that any slip up or trap can send you to a spiraling off-screen death. It gets ridiculously hype when you are down to two people and can barely see the map (due to how sudden death slowly starts diminishing your view area) and neither will quit despite how one clever grappling hook or power up can end the game. It's got a great mix of maps as well as workshop created ones to play when you eventuallly get the swing of all the original ones. However be warned that being hit by 3 grappling hooks simultaneously may induce bitter rage towards all of your friends.
8160	1	a	Good game! I have to say its pretty enjoyable by yourself, but even better with a friend or 3. The online matches can be difficult to join if you have small patience, but the worst wait I had was 5 minutes. Needless to say, recommended for experienced platformers (e.g Nintendo Fans) Its fast paced, so get ready to act fast!
8162	1	a	Ignore what the hours it says I play online, I've played for over 20 hours with my friends cause I have everything on my laptop. We play for hours and hours against each other just trying to out run the others. I saw funhaus playing it and I thought it looked like it would've fun with other people.
8164	1	a	Really really awesome game. Got it from a friend and we got hooked instantly. It looked really hard in the trailers, but it's really playable as a noob.
8166	1	a	Who wouldnt recommend this game? It's incredibly fun to play with friends and you can create your own levels. Instabuy.
8168	1	a	Easy to pick up, and a ton of fun to play with friends. It's a game where you can have a quick 15 minute session or hours.
8170	1	a	Good game! I have to say its pretty enjoyable by yourself, but even better with a friend or 3. The online matches can be difficult to join if you have small patience, but the worst wait I had was 5 minutes.

8172	1	a	Lot's of fun until none of your friends want to play with you anymore because you keep winning D:
8174	1	a	It is realy fun if you play it for a bit
8176	1	a	Do you like wacky and fun, just random games to play? Then this is the game for you. The multiplayer functions work nicely, the game itself works nicely, and well, just in itself it works nicely. I personally love to play it when I am just in the mood for something, funny, yet relaxing. Ofcourse some people would dissagree with me about the relaxing part ofcourse. I definitely reccomend Speedrunners.  Greetings, Quinn.

8194	1	a	Good quick fun among friends, fast paced and addictive combat/race style
8196	1	a	This game is a lot of fun if you stick with it. It has a very high learning curve but if you get over that hill, it's highly rewarding and infinitely replayable. It has good community with very few trolls/toxic players, and new players are coming in all the time.   I hope you have fun time in SpeedRunners!

8216	1	a	Fast Pace and very fun game :D
8218	1	a	One of the funniest game I have ever played.
8220	1	a	Um, Well its an amazing game i love the characters the add ons ore cool  but they need to add JackSepticEye and Bob and Wade.  I LOVE THE GAME
8222	1	a	Love this game I totally recommend it!
8224	1	a	Would love to see Tracer from overwatch as a character in this game as it goes with the theme.
8226	1	a	  the only thing this game is missing is a fail compilation
8228	1	a	i more of a FastWalker myself. 5000/10000
8230	1	a	Not even horror games get my heart pumping this fast.
8232	1	a	amazing game. i was hooked as soon as i started playing.
8234	1	a	I AM THE FAST.  Wait, I said it wrong. Hold on. (Take 2)  I AM THE SPEED.
8236	1	a	This game is addictive with intense gameplay and great level design. And many unlockable characters and skin so there is always something new.
8238	1	a	Takes tons of practice. You usually get matched with people who are alot better than you. While you may get dicouraged and think you have no chance against them, just watch how they move and try to replicate it.
8240	1	a	Excellent Game, it has a cool gameplay
8242	1	a	good game for multiplayer
8244	1	a	Do you like wacky and fun, just random games to play? Then this is the game for you. The multiplayer functions work nicely, the game itself works nicely, and well, just in itself it works nicely. I personally love to play it when I am just in the mood for something, funny, yet relaxing. Ofcourse some people would dissagree with me about the relaxing part ofcourse. I definitely reccomend Speedrunners.  Greetings, Quinn.
8246	1	a	This game has been an amazingly pleasant surprise. I picked it up in a Humble Bundle and forgot about it. I had some friends over for the weekend a few weeks later and randomly remembered it. We fired it up, and proceeded to play from 8pm until 6 am. Since then, they've all picked it up and we play several times a week. The game is full of laughs and subleties you would never expect! I still find ways to go a little faster and boy does it feel good when you hit that super speed and keep it going for several screens' lengths! Play with friends and don't start without them! Learning Speedrunners alongside a group of friends and laughing it up is some of the most fun I've had in months!
8248	1	a	hey that's pretty good
8250	1	a	 Early Access Review
8252	1	a	1. Wins game 2. Game crashes 3. 'You lost 10 rank points by exiting a ranked game previously.' 4. commits suicide  In all seriousness, it's a good game, you should give it a try. I would give it a 10/10, but it has some minor (to major) netcode problems. It has a *great* community though, espcially for a game that's this competitive!    Please give me my 10 points back though, I'm close to ranking up dammit. :(
8254	1	a	Thrilling racing game! Once you learn the mechanics and are familiar with the maps, you'll truly have the thrilling moments of inching toe-to-toe with another master trying to outrun each others!
8256	1	a	i played this game the first time with my big brothers. i was fall in love instantly. it is perfect to play with friends or online
8258	1	a	Froze my opponents, launched a rocket on them, they raged quit 10/10 would do it again
8260	1	a	 Early Access Review
8262	1	a	Me and my friends all get together and play, and its a blast everytime. Works pretty well over the internet too for when were too lazy or sick to meet up in person. Super fun gameplay makes for exciting thrills
8264	1	a	Amazing game to play with friends ;p
8266	1	a	i hate this stupid match making system of the game. when i am trying to play a ranked game my opponents are ALWAYS got higher rank then me. they ALWAYS pick advance maps or the maps i didnt even played before. and then guess what? I LOST!!!!!! the game has to make sure that a ranked game contains players who are in the same rank/level.
8268	1	a	BEST GAME EVER!!! Playing with friends makes the game more fun than playing it solo.
8270	1	a	Good game very competitive

8276	1	a	  It's really good game with friends :)) simple to play. *10 for this game
8278	1	a	 Early Access Review
8280	1	a	Along with Lethal League, awesome game to have at social events (dinners, gatherings with lots of alcohol and etc). Even SOME non gamers friends of mine enjoyed it (girls included).
8282	1	a	Really fun one of those games where you never stop playing, there are some rage moments but all round it's a lot of fun
8284	1	a	Fantastic game.Lot of mechanics to be fastest a lot of maps to learn.Fantastic game. Only thing that ruin it is these items. 9,9/10
8286	1	a	Great Game!
8288	1	a	Very very good fun. Still getting my ♥♥♥ kicked online. But I'm learning! :D
8290	1	a	Fantastic game, my friend got it in Early Access. The story isn't by any means thick but a fun way to play single player and get your a** kicked by incredibly challenging AI. comparable to a 2d, vertical mario cart, lots of fun and the music is VERY energizing!
8292	1	a	This is awesome. Intuitive, fast, and as casual or skillful as you want. Great with local coop.
8294	1	a	it is fun 
8296	1	a	Really fun party game!   Now I need friends....
8298	1	a	SpeedRunners is by far one of my favorite games. It's such an addicting game despite its simplistic look. I highly recommend it, especially with friends!!
8300	1	a	Cool :)
8302	1	a	Great game if youre bored and dont know what to play with friends! 10/10 much emotions very yes. IF youre interested in a German gameplay of Speedrunner check out my vid.         YouTube™ Video:  Speedrunners: Spoderman and Friends (GERMAN)&nbsp;
8304	1	a	  This is a awesome game and everybody should totally play it 
8306	1	a	You will hate everybody except yourself because you are always the best in this game!
8308	1	a	  COOL
8310	1	a	Best game ever made to play with freinds
8312	1	a	An insanely addicting, action-packed, fast-paced sidescroller. Centered around races and a grappling hook. BUY THIS GAME. IMMEDIATELEY.
8314	1	a	fast game                                                                        inx)dx=π2∫0πf(sinx)dx -

8318	1	a	Best game ever play with friends debeli deca
8320	1	a	High Octane thrill and fun . This game has quite the difficulty if one is not used to fast paced platformers. Graphics are great . Music is great . Overall a fun game .
8322	1	a	 Early Access Review
8324	1	a	Fantastic game, well polished, multiplayer is brilliant and the ranking system works really well (When you can find a game).  Very original, fun and challenging.  9/10 - GAMEPLAY 5/10 - STORY (Mainly gets you accustomed to the game for multiplayer) 10/10 - MULTIPLAYER 7/10 - PRICE  8.5/10 OVERALL
8326	1	a	IF UR HANDS ARENT SWEATY THEN UR NOT PLAYING IT RIGHT!
8328	1	a	Simple and addictive
8330	1	a	Like Mario Kart but with legs!
8332	1	a	Funny game to play with friends =D
8334	1	a	Speed runner is the go to game when I have guest over 
8336	1	a	It's super fun, but only with friends you are playing with, random people is kinda boring.  6.5/10
8338	1	a	Awesome, you can see this game and just look at it 'Oh it's trash.' But seriously it really isn't. I normally don't write reviews but this game is just that Awesome. - FaCe Halo
8340	1	a	A great game to play with friends, or even without them. A game with one of the best communities overall I`ve ever experienced. I recommend it highly to anyone who likes a not-everyday platformer experience.
8342	1	a	Cuz its really interesting
8344	1	a	This game is fun for hours and at a cheap cheap price!
8346	1	a	This game is great! The maps are a lot of fun, so many little techniques to master, workshop support for more maps, and online play makes it one of my favorites.
8348	1	a	You can lower your resolution without losing the HD 10/10
8350	1	a	A pretty good game where you  gotta go fast  and become   the fastest man alive  so you can end your friendships with one single grappling hook. 5/7
8352	1	a	i actually stopped playing this game cuz it was too easy
8354	1	a	This game has always been a favorite playing at a friends house. its awesome endless hours of fun! It recently became avaliable on mac so i purchased out of pure excitement. I also recently purchased a steam controller since most of my games are controller supported. well it didnt quite pan out as I planned. it doesnt work with a lot of games controller supported or not, no matter how i configure the controller. I can still play with the keyboard, but id love to see it working on speedrunners soon. 9.5/10  ps. of coarse the guy with a mac buys a steam controller *facepalm*
8356	1	a	... Still waiting for anyone to join multiplayer.  Still waiting.
8358	1	a	Man, they should call this game SALTrunners. Playing with my friends get me and my friends pretty damn salty. HOWEVER, It is still a lot of fun and I highly recommend it
8360	1	a	  Fun Fast Running (Triping) Action! Very addciting with friends.
8362	1	a	This game is a blast and a half. We usually describe it as '2D platformer Mario Kart', so if that sounds like your jam, pick this up. It's become a staple for game nights.
8364	1	a	As someone who's a fan of both platforming games and racing games, I think SpeedRunners is a fantastic combination of both genres. It's kinda like classic 2D Sonic the Hedgehog with Mario Kart items, and it's hella fun. However, the online multiplayer experience suffers greatly from really bad desync issues. In a game that depends so heavily on the players' positions on the screen, it seems like it would be really important to have everyone's games synchronized, especially in ranked multiplayer.
8366	1	a	One of the most fun and challenging multiple game ive played in a long time!  10/10
8368	1	a	6 hours of running in a video game.   Worth 10 bucks  10/10 run
8370	1	a	Fast and frantic four-player platform racing game. Great for parties.
8372	1	a	I think that... If you're thinking this might be your type of game. But this title now!  P.S The early access community atleast has been awesome so far to be playing with :) Big thank you for all of you I've had the wonderful experience of playing with :)
8374	1	a	On the surface, it's a mediocre game about running that's worth maybe $5. Dig deeper, and it's an excellent party game with friends, well worth the $15.  Dig even deeper, and it's an incredibly deep and complex game of strategy, improvisation, and quick reactions, with a fair ranking system that rewards consistently doing well, despite winning or losing the match overall. Of course, winning is much more valuable, points wise, but losing by 1 round isn't going to hurt you much, if it hurts you at all. In fact, in a full lobby, it'll probably net you some points.  At it's core, it's easily worth more than they're asking, if you like these sorts of games.
8376	1	a	Whether you want a cool party game or a competitive game to master overtime, SpeedRunners is a great game and you should defiantly get it.
8378	1	a	they gave me free stuff.       best game ever
8380	1	a	A game that is one of those that when you get into it, you won't let go. Not atleast for a hundred hours :) This is THE game to play with your 3 friends, you can do it all locally or get some online players involved. It's up to you.  I got this game from a weekly humble bundle for a dollar. The best dollar I've ever spent.
8382	1	a	Much friend many wow.    On a more serious note: This game is on of the funnest local multiplayer and online games I have ever played. All you need is a friend and a controller. It has steam workshop activated so you cn download user created maps. The grappling is amazing and you are basically god when you get the perfect swing. 10/10 would bang again         metaphorically
8384	1	a	Great game to play with friends
8386	1	a	Awesome and fast-paced sidescrolling racing game. A lot of fun to play with your friends.
8388	1	a	If you like games such as Super Meat Boy and Dust Force you're gonna love this game!
8390	1	a	action pack game where you click to be faster than enemy gamers
8392	1	a	speed is lit (I mean the drug speed)
8394	1	a	This is an amazing game, it's so fun to play!!!
8396	1	a	This game is like drugs. Using it for a long time gives you super powers
8398	1	a	Really fun game, while playing with friends or even people you don't know. You either love it or hate it!
8400	1	a	Nice game!
8402	1	a	Fast paced multiplayer game that is really fun to play with friends.
8404	1	a	A really good game if you want your friends to think that you cheat. But really, it is a good game for its 'speedy' felling.
8406	1	a	The reviews were not kidding, this game is addictive!
8408	1	a	GOTTA GO FAST BOI!!!!!!  Never was it easier to lose your friends over a game, since monopoly
8410	1	a	SUMMARY Speedrunners can be really fun as long as you have friends to play with. If you play with your friends, 15e is totally worth cause you can spend a lot of time in it. However if you play it solo, this game actually quite sucks.  88/100  PROS - amazing and fun to listen soundtrack - gameplay is really fun - graphics are simple ( low hw needs ) but they look good - the game has its own physics which make sense and are creative  CONS - the game sometimes doesn´t respect even its physics - I experienced many bugs and internet connection issues which made the game unplayable - almost unplayle on keyboard ( controller needed )
8412	1	a	A must buy. Intense, fun and stressful!
8414	1	a	In this game, everybody can do speedruns!!!
8416	1	a	3 words: skill, butthurt, satisfaction.
8418	1	a	This game is rad. Best when played with a few buddies while talking ♥♥♥♥. Grappling Hook is broken though, Blizzard plz nerf
8420	1	a	I like this game, because how fun this game is :)
8422	1	a	This game is simply.......amazing! Its's so simple yet so complex in each race. Kinda like the US elections with a lot more thought put behind it
8424	1	a	cant stop winning
8426	1	a	This game is incredible for a local multiplayer game. Controls are very simple. Yet game is very competitve. Good for all skill levels. It may be problematic if there is a gap between player skills, as there is no way to handicap. Additionally, there's content that can only be unlocked in Story Mode, and some bonehead decided to disable co-op for the story, so you have to play this multiplayer game by yourself to complete it and unlock the characters. I love the aesthetic. I cannot reccommend this game enough.
8428	1	a	Really fun game, while playing with friends or even people you don't know. You either love it or hate it!
8430	1	a	Really nice game
8432	1	a	Great game to play with friends.
8434	1	a	Fun game. Does need new maps and has some bugs.  I would recommend.
8436	1	a	  Pretty good game
8438	1	a	//100%
8440	1	a	I really love this game. It has so much to unlock so you always have a reason to play. I don't play it all the time, but its always a game I go back to when I don't know what else to do.
8442	1	a	This game will make you want to play it again and again and again and again and again....
8444	1	a	This isn't a 'speedrun' but this is a frantic game with multiplayer in mind. The basic idea is to run off the edge of the screen causing your opponents to lose. With grapple mechanics like Worms/Spiderman and special items to trip up your opponents this is quite a captivating little game. There are a large number of different character skins to unlock and different levels. Each level is structured completely differently with various obstacles. It's pretty cheap and cheerful and definitely worth considering if you like games which are easy to learn but tough to master.
8446	1	a	It's a fun local game, just get it.
8448	1	a	This is a good game.
8450	1	a	Cool game where you race until one of your enemies or you is out of the screen!  I think its really enjoable!
8452	1	a	  Pretty good game
8454	1	a	good game for multiplayer
8456	1	a	Great game, always good with a few mates.
8458	1	a	This game will make you want to play it again and again and again and again and again....
8460	1	a	Fun to play locally with friends
8462	1	a	I like this game, because how fun this game is :)
8464	1	a	It's a fun local game, just get it.
8466	1	a	fun game !! and it can make you addict ! play with your friend will be more fun xD
8468	1	a	  This game is so good I am happy for playing this game And Update maps,character and weapon is so amazing
8470	1	a	I nominated Speed Runners for the 'Most Fun to Play with Actual People in the Room' Award. (My suggestion for the extra category in the current Steam Awards.) I think that says it all.
8472	1	a	Played this with some friends.     We are not friends anymore.
8474	1	a	great game
8476	1	a	easy to enjoy, difficult to master. a must have if you enjoy 4 player local games!
8478	1	a	3 words: skill, butthurt, satisfaction.
8480	1	a	Awesome and fast-paced sidescrolling racing game. A lot of fun to play with your friends.
8482	1	a	Great game to play with friends
8484	1	a	Nice game!
8486	1	a	Better with friends so that you can yell at them for hooking you, shooting missles at you, for blocking your hooks, and making your life miserable. Better with friends so that you can laugh at them when you win or yell at them when you lose.  10/10
8488	1	a	Be nasty to your friends: check High speed precision plattformer: check Good music: check Hours of hours of fun: check  Would make my friends scream in rage again 11/10
8490	1	a	A really good game if you want your friends to think that you cheat. But really, it is a good game for its 'speedy' felling.
8492	1	a	Insanely chaotic and crazy fun.
8494	1	a	Until Rocket League ate my life, this was THE multiplayer game I played. My office became obsessed with it and there is depth to the strategy and gameplay that benefits this kind of obsession. Playing online is savage because ranked play is dominated by players who never stopped playing but even being wrecked is fun because you learn new strategies to handle the maps.  If it weren't for workshop support, the supplied maps would eventually become fairly rote, but because the community is thriving, I can't knock it for that either. Play SpeedRunners and be happy.
8496	1	a	Great game to play with friends
8498	1	a	First you go fast, then you go slow, then you cry
8500	1	a	Really nice game
8502	1	a	Great game. Workshop really shines with this game!
8504	1	a	Absolutely addictive! Perfect for hours of fun with friends, playing local multiplayer (up to 4 players)
8506	1	a	Just look at my playtime.
8508	1	a	great game
8510	1	a	Probably one of the best online party games available on PC at the moment. Would probably be awesome to play on a steambox in your parents living room with friends.

8534	1	a	Well , i gotta say speedrunners it's a really great game , you can start it off by playing with friends i really recommad you startin' this way.But still after a while you're gonna meet players which are better than you and thats gonna make you say 'Holy ♥♥♥♥ i wanna be fast as he is' then the game starts gettin' competitive , there are lots of mods , trails and character skin's that you can download or create your own.You should really try out this game cause it's just amazing. The only con about this game is , it ain't that populated , i wish youtubers would gave this game a chance because it deserves it! I only see from 200 to 500-600 players a day and that makes me sad cause on sale this game made up to 8000 players and it was just amazing. Anyway give it a try it's amazing and btw it's gonna make you rage and ♥♥♥♥-off badly! Have fun playin!

240	0	a	This game has really nice fast paced gameplay and something MANY games lack and that would be local multiplayer. This game is beyond fantastic when playing with friends to pass some time. I often play it on the train with a friend of mine to pass the two hours.  And even though this review so far seems positive, that only applies to the local MP and VERY few online matches.  This game is overflowing with cancerous smurfers who abuse every single glitch, bug to just steam roll you. When you come into this game you're a legitimate entry or beginner league. So are those idiots who need to compensate something and take it out on new players. All of them either make new accounts solely to buy the game or de-rank in ranked by just letting everyone beat you.  The end result is you (newbie) getting paired up with up to 3 pixel perfect virgins who do absolutely nothing but play the game from the looks of it. You'll know it when you see it for yourself.  But as I said at the start: This game IS fun if you have friends (People you actually know IRL) to play with. I would have made this review positive but it's more likely that anyone who gets the game will go play a random game online than a game with their friends and that is why I can't recommend this game.  If you're looking for local MP, feel free to get it. (I honestly waited for a sale because I kind of knew what I was going into with the Online and I suggest you do too but it's your money.)
241	0	a	In some update they made it so you have to unlock everything with earning XP by winning rounds, even power-ups to pick up need to be unlocked this way now. That took a lot out of the fun for me. Also the menu screens barely work and look very dodgy. Overall the game feels more like an early access or 2000-era flash game.
242	0	a	 Early Access Review
243	0	a	Don't buy this. It's 15 dollars for a game thats fun for about 3 hours. Not to mention, you unlock characters/levels/items through leveling up, and this game literally has one of the slowest level up systems ever. It takes up to 50 matches to go up one level, and one match can be anywhere between 2 minutes to 20 minutes. The online community is full of incredibly toxic people and annoying kids who won't stop spamming the chat with '♥♥♥♥ing hackers, stop using the golden hookshot!'. The maps are very bland and short, and despite the fact there are about 25 or so maps, only 4-5 ever get chosen. The ranked matchmaking system makes no sense and unfairly places people, no matter how many matches you win or lose. The art style is simple and sleek, and I do like the art style, but the interesting artistic style is wasted on the poor character designs. Look up some of the characters, and just see how ugly they look, not just in game, but also in their menu screen images/round win images. Characters like the Japanese cat, Sherlock Bones and the Shark are just painful to look at (I just call them by what they are, because I'm not taking the time to remember the names of over 30 hideous characters).  The servers on online are also terrible. Every 1/20 games you play or so you will have nobody that lags. Every single game, everybody is lagging, or someone is lagging out the server, or the game is glitching. It also doesn't help that there are only at one time about 1600-1800 people online, and despite that it tries its best to pair you in the same server multiple times. I played a match in which it was me and 2 other people. I managed to beat the other person, but the camera was stuck on an AFK player, playing Skullduggery. I couldn't even see my character, yet i was alive, and I ended up just being stuck and running around. After about 2 minutes, I just exploded and Skullduggery won. The game is incredibly buggy, full of toxic children, and people that shout 'HACKER' at good players, and every once and a while a legitmate hacker shows up and ruins the fun.   Seriously though, over 40 characters, over 20 maps, and yet almost every character is poorly designed and only 4-5 maps are chosen? Barely any content, stupid, overpriced game with overpriced sell-out 'YOUTUBE POPULAR MEME!' DLC, and overall I just can't recommend this game. It's too small, has no playerbase, and has very little content. Fun for about 3-4 hours. It sucks that I played for 3 hours and 10 minutes, because if i didn't spend that 10 minutes I would definetly request a refund.

But now it's fully released and it's been released in a terrible state. The early access versions were in a pretty good state when they were launched, so how, after like 2 years of being in EA, how can you mess up it's official launch.  There are tons of online issues that I have encountered in the final version, which a friend of mine complained about in the EA version and the devs did nothing to fix any of the issues he complained about. Servers randomly crashing, Cameras zooming inso u can't see what you're doing, all of those problems are still present in the full release.  In my opinion, this is still in Early access, because not all of the content is in the game, you've locked off unlockable trails that you claim are in Beta. That means that this should still be in early access if you're asking us to be your beta testers for trails you haven't officially launched.  When the game worked and when the game didn't crash on me randomly, I did have fun with the game, I want you to understand that and I hope that these issues are fixed in the future.  As the game currently stands in it's 'fully released' version, I can't recommend it with the problems that are currently facing it. I really want this game to be a success and I fealt really sad when I saw all of these issues. I want to like this game but these glaring issues prevent me from doing so.

Mayby it's a ledge where you get stuck, or a platform where you get stuck or a wall where you get stuck or 'name a thing' and you get stuck. That's not including any user submitted maps, And I haven't even started about the Online or Ranked part. Literally, literally not figuratively, everyone and their grandmother is cheating.  You thought CoD was full of cheaters? You haven't seen nothing yet!  Everyone who isn't cheating is lagging out their ♥♥♥! Rarely do you play a game where at least, AT LEAST! one of the players has a ♥♥♥♥ connection. The ONLY redeeming factor is that on custom games it's more stable, which means you can easily play with you friends.

Go through page after page on forums trying out any possible fix I can find. Nothing. Seems to be a common enough problem since there's a pinned FAQ topic for the game not launching created by the dev. Already gave a copy to my girlfriend so I can't get a refund through Steam without going through her account first?  This is the only game I've bought this sale. Aaaand...it doesn't work for me. For what it's worth, it works on my girlfriend's computer.

I would try to learn one of the new maps then another would come out before i even learnt the first one, it was a good game but community maps ruined it.

277	0	a	Speedrunners is a fun multiplayer game that turned bad with it's latest update.  The game itself is good, the mechanics work, the graphics are fitting and the menu has mouse support... yay.  I can nitpick a little about the steep learning curve for beginners or that it doesn't auto adjust screen resolution and only runs in 16:9 (or with black bars) but that are minor complains.  The big gamebreaker is the unlock system. I have to say that I generally disagree with unlock systems in Multiplayer games, as I think, that fun gameplay (which theoretically is given here) should be the motivator for playing a game.  This game provides one of the poorest examples I have seen so far as you only have acces to two maps and four characters in the beginning. To unlock the others you have to level up, wich in my opinion takes to much time to do .  Because I only bought this game for local coop and am not interested in online play at all, this game is now pretty much unplayable.  I can not recommend this game for local multiplayer.

320	0	a	Lets make this quick... This game... very promising on the outside and many people would put themselves in front of this game to protect it, but what I believe is the complete opposite. This was the biggest waste of my money because the heart wrenchingly boring gameplay, the first five minutes has a lot of potential but after those few minutes this became an astronomical waste of my time and money. This 'game' loses its flare relatively quick, and when you buy this game for 15$...Whew!!! what a waste!!! If you plan on even spending a dime on this... THINK AGAIN!!!! Steam has so many better games that you could get 50 hours out of easily. I wish i could've returned it but at the time I didnt know you could do that with steam. All I'm saying is... Do your research, Do not look at the intro video (All that thing does is hype you up for a dissapointment, And most importantly keep looking before you buy...

This allows ther person who makes a sick grappel get fuqed by the item; which could be a: Golden Grappel, Shockwave, etc...   I think this should be removed and destroyed and desinigrated. Destroy the atoms and electons that lerk inside.

It doesn't. You'll be matched round 1 against people with hundreds if not thousands of rounds in their belt. I literally got put in a game with a platinum ranked person on my very first quick game.  I mean, you could say that you will learn and catch up to the 195 current players on release day, but they're that damn good that you won't even get a chance to play enough to figure the game out. Played it for 20 minutes but felt like I had 2 minutes of gameplay and 18 minutes watching others.  Bad first impressions, just down to how difficult it would be to get into as a new buyer when it has been about for so long.

510	0	a	NOTE - I didn't proofread this all that much, their may be a few minor grammatical/ punctuation mistakes. Sorry but it's just a review for a game :P .  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  TL;DR - 542 hours on game,friends with devs, played with the best, was one of the best, can't recommend, buggy and runs baddy (and has only gotten worse), a joke of a Ranked/ 'e-sport' game, endless dev cycle. NOT Worth $15 at all!  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  542 Hours on this game, played with the best, got to Silver league (when there were less then 70 in it) and 6 gold players. Made friends with most of the developers, bought it for 4 other people.  Yet I no longer can recommend this game at all, it's not worth $15 at all the average player will play like a couple hours then be bored because the lack of game modes, endless bugs/ glitches (which have become more apparent with every update) not to mention the game runs worse with each update, used to run steady 60fps no v-sync now it has random FPS drops randomly and I’m not the only one.  The game has no game modes just small modifiers that are really just gimmicks with no actual value and add nothing to the game, the core design of this game leads it to being repetitive as hell, the workshop maps are generally terrible, re-hashes, or just not fun to play with few exceptions. There is also the fact that currently the Single player doesn't play at all like multi-player and hasn't been touched in years. Also the fact that it's in basically in infinite development cycle.  Also, the Ranked/ 'e-sport' part of this game is a joke because of how bare minimum this games mechanics are, the skill-ceiling is not low but it's really just getting more consistent at things, and using items which are pure RNG. And with that the levels after zoo and most levels in general off of the Ranked Workshop and Official set of maps are really not that great at all for a competitive scene.  I can keep going, but i think my main points were made. Even with all the time i put in and even being consistently recognized by the developers  (https://gyazo.com/9a6e9100bf84aba1287f1921e056abc9  ) being listed on the Demo page (when that was a thing) and more, i can not recommend this game because the only enjoyment i found out of it was if you are in a Skype call talking to someone the whole time otherwise it's boring, and if you aren't a person who likes to do repetitive game play you're going to have issues!

524	0	a	Okay, this game is great for the first 10 minutes. Everything seems fine, but then those weeaboo's that you're playing with they just ruin the game and make you want to break something. It's frustrating when you try and have some fun but the game absolutely infuriates your soul. DO not buy this game, I'm already uninstalling the game, while writing this review. Thank you if you're reading this :) .
525	0	a	this is an absolute ♥♥♥♥ game mechanics are broken items dont work and the speed that you get from events like heiting slopes is a randomized value that cant ever be predicted if you want more rng in a game go play a dice game only way to get more rng ♥♥♥♥ game would not recomend to even the most vile of people

666	0	a	On of the recent updates totally broke the game. My Controller input is HEAVILY delayed, and i notice the input delay, making the entire game almost a guesswork to when i should jump and move in what direction.
667	0	a	Game makes you unlock everything. Huge hassle when all I want to do is play local multiplayer but all we have is 4 characters and three maps, and can't even play custom maps! Absolutely ridiculous.

You can also play online against random people but is not the same although still good.  I am not the one to say how much the game should cost but I wouldn´t buy it for full price, got it for 3$

692	0	a	Edit: Don't get really boring
693	0	a	piece of ♥♥♥♥!!!!!!
694	0	a	This is not a bad game, however there are more pros than cons. Pros: Fun with friends. Helps improve your reaction time, and your reflex with your keyboard. Cons: It is not worth 15 dollars nor 10, graphics are simple, and nothing about it shows that it deserves to be on that price range, so i recomment to buy it on sale. Rage quits...a lot of rage quits, personal experience, however this is due to the fact that the game ♥♥♥♥s you, every single map have a cheap shot spot, where if u mess up u lose, there are no combacks unless u can reciver instantly, but i doubt it because of the fact that the game itself will punish u for messing it up once, if u dont believe me and u have this game go see for yourselves. Online is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t half the time because so many players are salty, and please do not play online if u just got the game because most likely u will get beaten over and over again. Conclusion: Speed runners is not a bad game, i do recommend some to get it but if u are a slow learner, or rage quits easily (because a lot of stupid and cheap ♥♥♥♥ will happen) dont get this game, also like i said before plz get this on sale, i hate the producers for making this game cost 15 dollars, i honestly dont see why they would do that. One tip i will give u is practice and memorize, because if u dont practice or know the maps u will lose over and over again. To me i have a love and hate relationship with this game because there is just so many stupid ♥♥♥♥ that ♥♥♥♥en tilts me, like camera movement will ♥♥♥♥ you, the starting postions are random, and half the time u will have to gamble which move u have to take.
695	0	a	Completely abandonded after they 'released' the game.  Ranked mode is garbage since they allow custom stages and they also slapped everyone in the face with microtransactions.
696	0	a	♥♥♥♥ this game, it crashes every time on the second level(the boat one). And it's the worst kind of crash too, I have to sign out to kill it. I don't recommend it because it just doesn't work.

701	0	a	To be honest im kinda addicted to this game at first,but i thinks it's kinda dying now when i try to find online matchmaking it's really hard,sometimes i get none.Maybe the developper need to make this game like free for only like 1 or 2 days,because i dont think this game will last any longer.
702	0	a	I'll leave negative responce for this now. Game is totaly great and fun. Especially if you play it shot or with friends.  What minuses are - it's totaly clear that devs don't play it hard. So there some glithes, some mechanical bugs and many other stuff.  Also if you want to beat game fully and get all of achievement you'll find this game totaly annoying. First: dialogs are fun only ONE time. After repeating level after level with bots in story this totaly makes this game bad. Also no ability to restart level also bad. Last thing: bots on 'unfair' difficulty are totaly unfair. By that I mean that they aren't beatable on some levels. First - they always outrun you whatever you do. Faster you run - more f*** up they became. even with fastest lap time and record you will lose just cuz'!   At all other things game is pretty much awesome! But devs, please, play you game as intended from begining till end rebalance so at least you could win 5-10 times in a row without depending on luck!
703	0	a	  hard as ♥♥♥♥ and going online is pretty much pointless. meh.
704	0	a	ENG:  I buy that a game only because of Payday 2 addons.   FIN:  Ostin pelin vain saadakseni Payday 2 lisä sisältöä.
8550	1	a	F1 2012 is the last good F1 game made by codemasters. From F1 2012, the series has been in a decline unfortunely. Apart from a few annoyances (the penalty system mostly) the game is awesome. Having played 500 hours plus both in single player and online, and all the modes, i can truly recommend this game for any racing fan really.
8552	1	a	An exciting racing experience
8554	1	a	Overall its a great game especially if you have tetris instead of PC, Its hard, even at easiest levels its still hard and very very frustrating. Its extremely challengeing, and very rewarding. The longer you play the better you will understand the physics of your car. Then when you change it, it starts all over again :)  This is the cheap way of getting to know a lot about F1 in general, before every race in real life I spin 20ish laps on the track to be sure to remember every corner, watching the real race after that is much much better and more understandable.  The only con I see is trouble with online multiplayer, it does not work for me. All in all 10/10, my favorite raceing sim, and guys if you are not cheating, first time you win the race in career, you will feel extremely good and proud :)
8556	1	a	I'm playing on win 10, with an xbox (PC) controller, no problems at all. My first try at an F1 official game, but I know how to play driving sims:  + Intro to Game (gets my adrenaline going before a race starts) + Graphics (great for 2012) + Execution (the accelerate and brake controls feel tight) + Well thought out tutorial / entry into the game + Cheap for an F1 game, these games are stubburn in pricing. Only costs £3 ish in sale + Lots of achievements  +/- I didnt like that brake assist was on, automatically. was a bit freaky to have the game brake for me but a great option for children though  Havent found any negatives so far, its what i expected, and it delivered it well. I'm a happy customer.   For what I paid (£2.75) 10/10
8558	1	a	after purchasing this on sale, my gah: timeless, this f1 game from codemasters is going down as a classic!   i know this will be funny, but always remember THIS is the final officially-licensed f1 game we'll be seeing the legendary red baron Michael Schumacher along with other 5 champions fingerboy Vettel, hammertime Hamilton, samurai matador Alonso, smooth smurf Button, and ice'cream'man(leave me alone) Kimi...yep you heard it right: 6 F1 champions inside this 2012 season in its time!  plus we have the great veterans: the future 2016 champion(hope not to jinx it) britney Rosberg, mark Wibbah, felipebaby Massa, superpedro Dela Rosa, the season podium prospects: the former 1st-lap nutcase Grosjean, checo Perez, kamikaze Kobayashi...and the ever-consistent Nico 'The Hulk'enberg!  they are too complete here we also have our lovable honey badger Ricciardo in his youngster year, ayrton senna's journeyman nephew Bruno, niceman Kovalainen, vyborg rocket Petrov and much much more...and oh i forgot, the guy we love(to hate?): the crashtor Pastor Maldonado in his best season(1st and only win)!  the driving physics is very good for its time: feel the difference of each team's cars during the penultimate year of the V8 era, with bending wide frontwings, coanda-effect exhausts, and the controversial stepped noses! features are adequate: coop and splitscreen gaming, time attacks and trials, champions mode(again, 6 champions~), the team switcheroo season challenge, and a career mode that can say you are the driver yourself!  every formula one fan, even those are not, will enjoy the ride of this epic F1 season...so grab this game!
8560	1	a	Although it's already a old game of F1 series, I still like to play it and don't need to buy new series, in my opinion this series is so far best of them (quality, sounds, etc). Worth buying.  Be sure to rek everyone with HRT in legendary mode, if you can...
8562	1	a	This game is both fast and furious. It's addictive to a point where you keep saying I'll just have one more race lol!!! I play this game in Eyefinity mode with 3 monitors and the graphics are pure class to see on 3 screens. I like my car racing games and this one measures up really well. The different modes are good and you get to choose what you want to do. As a pretty noob to pc gaming this game has me not wanting to switch my pc off. I like it a lot. and rate it highly.
8564	1	a	F1 2012 has a really enjoyable Fourmula One racing experience. The cars feel like they handle how they should unlike games like NFS or other arcade games like that. I would recommend this game to anyone looking for a good Fourmula One game!
8566	1	a	If you're looking for an amazing Formula One racing game, you came to the right store page. This game is awesome. The sense of speed while you're flying down the straight at Monoco is unmatched, and the sound of the engine whirring behind you is immersive matched with a good pair of headphones. I play it with a G27, and without many adjustments, the wheel feels just right in your hand. All of this bundled up in one beautiful looking package, is F1 2012
8568	1	a	This is perhaps the best racing game I have ever played. When I did bother to play it online with others, it was fairly easy to find racers and get some laps in. However I enjoy the single player aspects of it having found the scalable AI a sufficient and fair challenge. The various career and quick race modes plus the ability to do time trials and take on a variety of challenge events makes this a well-rounded product that has great graphics and sound, and a very approachable driving model.
8570	1	a	fun idea, just needs more people playing it.
8572	1	a	While the game itself isn't bad, the support for it is. It REQUIRES multiplayer, and the community for Dungeonbowl is puny, hopefully the sales will help fix that though.
8574	1	a	This is a paired down version of BloodBowl with fewer options, no campaigns and statically generated teams aimed at online MP rather than team management. If you want more MP than Blood Bowl then this is your game, if you want to relax punching Elves in the face then get Blood Bowl.
735	0	a	Graphics are decent, sound is great.  Not free to play. Demo at best. Start with a few cars and a couple of tracks. No way to earn/unlock cars, tracks or liveries in game. Every thing must be bought with real money which would bring the price well over $100. This type of payment models are the worst. And the sole reason I don't recommend this game.
736	0	a	Only Singleplayer/Hotlapping. Expensive Cars and Tracks. Old Graphics (Race07) with brighter Colours. Only the sound saves this 'game' for total collapse. Just another F2P Title which is here to milk out their costumers.
737	0	a	I used to be a Simbin customer for eight years until 12/3/13 due to the various issues that I have with this title. First off this game has no single player content like previous Simbin entries save for track test and time attacks. Next there is no multiplayer save for special promotional challenges and time attacks against another player's ghost car. Another thing is the sheer cost to have content equal to the legacy titles from Simbin as you will spend $100+ USD just on cars and tracks alone without even factoring in the cost of liveries of the cars purchased.  The positive points of this title is that the car audio is a step up from previous entries as the Zonda R sounds better than the GT Power pack version as an example. Another plus is that the car models are also a step up from the previous entry as they look much more detailed. Finally the physics are another step up as the cars feel a bit more responsive and can actually tell you when they will let go.  Unfortunately the cons are far too glaring to overlook and for now I'll have to say avoid this title as there are other titles that offer more content for your money.
738	0	a	This game is not bad because is free but thats only if u dont want more games or tracks because if you do then this game its not worth it to buy every car and track in the game you need 13446 vRP points or whatever that means an in real money equals to $146.78 you can buy F1 2013,WRC4 and Asseto Corsa and Grid and you still have $3 leftand thats regular price if you wait for steam sales you can even get more for your money im sorry but i will take 4 good games instead of 1 ok game for the same price if at least you can buy the whole package for $50 i can take that but no they want to ripp you off sorry this is not worth it
739	0	a	Exploitative microtransaction model makes the title very expensive to play. You are better off saving your money for Project Cars
8576	1	a	I suppose after 250 hours I should post a review. I race with a Logitech Momo wheel and triple 1920x1200 monitors with a nVidia GTX680.   This is the best racing simulation at the moment because:  1. Realistic physics 2. Excellent sound 3. Excellent force feedback 4. Plenty of cars to choose from - I recommend purchasing at least one of the following Experience packs: DTM2015+, ADAC GT Masters 201x so you get a good set of cars/tracks and then add DTM1992 and Group 5 packs later. WTCC2014 is also very good but if you don't know how FWD cars drive at the limit, test drive them first. 5. Single player has the Experiences, Custom Championships, Competitions and Leaderboard challenges to keep things interesting. 6. Multiplayer has dedicated server and allows for large fields. Of course who you race with determines if it's fun or not. For the most part the online racing is pretty good and active during the mornings in North America and during the evenings in Europe. Do not use the free-content races as a gauge on whether the racing is any good. I avoid free-content races.  To get the best deal when starting:  1. Grab a vRP package from the online store:  http://www.raceroomstore.com . You will get a code to redeem in the Store portion of the game. Click the [v] button beside the vRP amount then Redeem Code. 2. You get discounts when new packs have tracks/cars you've already purchased or if you purchase more than one item at a time (bulk discount). For example DTM2015 only cost around $10 USD if you already have DTM2013 or DTM2014
740	0	a	Total rip off. Have spent a fortune on tracks and cars and still no single player or online racing. It's totally boring in hotlap mode - DO NOT waste your money until the game is finished
741	0	a	Just five minutes in and I know EXACTLY what this game is about... It's about greed. There is barely any physics, any realism to this. It's simply a cash-grab.  You need vRP to do anything, and guess what, IT COSTS REAL MONEY!!  Yeah, it's Free-To-Play but it's Pay-To-Win.  DO NOT EVEN DOWNLOAD THIS GAME...YOU ARE WASTING YOUR TIME.
742	0	a	THIS IS A REVIEW OF DTM EXPERIENCE 2013!  Well, I was looking forward to exciting duels with quite good AI and entertainment like in real DTM races. What did I get ? Game with real tracks, cars and pilots, but WITHOUT PitStops, choise of tires, rules like yellow flags and damage. In the description of the game is: real DTM rules. Where are they ? I hope developers will add this things in free update, otherwise it is the worst purchase of the year!  SimBin what happened with you ?!
8578	1	a	The most under-rated racing simulation on the market, yet in my opinion one of the best with the potential to be even better.   Raceroom Racing Experience (better known as R3E) has improved immeasurably over the past year or so. No longer a featureless hot-lapper as it was in the first early years, R3E has experienced a turn-of-direction toward a proper racing simulation. Developers Sector3 -formerly Simbin - are trying to build a simulation worthy of its forebears - the GTR and RACE series. R3E is steadily but surely becoming what we all hoped GTR3 would be. It's still got some way to go and many core features are yet to be implemented, but R3E is on the right path.  R3E has a good mix of approachability and realism. There is something here for casual racers and simulation enthusiats alike. Content is focused on purpose-built race cars, predominantly touring cars and GT racing (with open-wheel and endurance content to come), and in this field R3E is peerless. If you want road cars and supercars as per Gran Turismo and Forza it's best to look elsewhere. Track content is also exceptional both in number and quality. Online racing is pretty stable and offline features pretty decent AI with an adaptive feature that matches the CPU controlled cars to the player's pace for a good challenge every time. The real highlight of R3E is the audio - it's the benchmark, as simple as that. I cannot be understated how much good sound adds to the immersion of a racing sim. Sector3 clearly understand this. It's brilliant,  A little more on the 'free-to-play' aspect - it's not really F2P in the traditional sense. There is a very small selection of free cars and tracks with almost no scope to unlock new content or credits by playing, although parts of the game can be played for free such as hot-lap competitions. It's a modular game where the user can buy exactly the content they like rather than paying for a whole game or DLC packs. I think it works well.  To summarise, R3E is something of a hidden-gem, worthy of any sim-racer's time. It's a project that's only going to get better. It's certainly my go-to sim.
8580	1	a	Having initially dismissed Raceroom and in fact, being mostly unimpressed, I recently re-installed to give it another crack. Still being in Beta, I figured it was fair to.  I am rather surprised to say that it is genuinely superb and I always come away from Raceroom satified and my racing thirst quenched.  Genre-defining sounds (Really, they are the best sounds on any sim, anywhere), Genre-defining AI (again, really. Blows Assetto Corsa and rFactor 2 AI out of the water), Pleasant visuals, Intuitive handling, cracking FFB. Can't fault any of that.  I see some complain about the pricing of the addons. It's pretty reasonable, especially when compared to the liked of iRacing. Yesterday evening I purchased the DTM 1992 pack of cars and the European track pack. That's 5 very high quality, different vehicles with different strengths and 14 european circuits. I paid under £15 for this (admittedly with some discounts from prior purchases). This little lot would set you back right around the £100 mark, if not more on iRacing. Just throwing that out there.  Added to that you can try any car for free before you buy......   Highly recommend, great game and sim!
8582	1	a	I haven't played R3E from the beginning. So I don't know what these people are saying, when they are implying that this wasn't always such a great sim.  I've got 200 hours on Assetto Corsa. That was the sim that first got me hooked on the scene. Since then I've tried every sim out there. Nowadays I find myself only enjoying R3E. Why? Because of the quality of everything. I think it's probably the FFB that I'm most impressed with. It's the most predictable and sensitive I've seen yet. I instantly see and understand why I mess up my laps. I know that if I were more attentive to the wheel I could've driven better.  And so, when I return to other sims after driving around R3E I feel frustrated. The FFB feels so inaccurate I almost feel like deleting every other sim but R3E from Steam. Probably the only other one that comes close is Automobilista. But it's weird that even in that game what feels like a punishment appears as a learning opportunity in R3E, as it should in real life.  I think I'm beginning to sound a little crazy, but I actually feel guilty for not playing R3E more. I feel like this game deserves thousands of hours of enjoyment, which I'm unable to provide since my life situation. Other people complain about Sector3 milking cash. I, on the other hand, think that I'm not appreciating the work they have put in this game enough. I feel like the money I've given them isn't enough to show my appreciation for this game.  Do I recommend RaceRoom Racing Experience? If you're into serious racing, it's the only game you'll ever need. It's everything one could hope from a sim. So yes, I do recommend it.
8584	1	a	Recent updates are very good with single player and multiplayer added. The graphics and driving are excellent. Try the free version, you can have a pretty good go with that, then maybe buy a favorite track ( Bathurst!) and a couple of cars and take it from there. The new GT Masters set is very good....WTCC is coming in a week!!  Still has bugs , but is getting really good. I'd recommend it to any driving sim fan.

8588	1	a	Not a reviewer so bear with me. Have been driving sims for longer than I can remember and have gone from 16 pixels per car to trillions. Most so called sims are mearly (imho) just games made complicated and hard to drive. I d/loaded this sim in Jan 2013 and to be honest, although having bags of potential I felt there were just to many short comings, my f/f wheel would randomly twitch without warning, I couldn't gauge grip levels, to be honest it felt a bag of crap but here's the thing, I persevered and slowly (very slowly at my age) things came together and times dropped. Don't get me wrong there were still problems and with the lack of multiplayer my interest was waining! Multiplayer alpha arrived hoorah and along with the ongoing updates to physics etc this sim was coming together, some great tracks and cars and now bumper to bumper racing, interest rekindled! Over the last week or so Sector3 have made a huge 10Gb update to this sim and wow, WOW, this already well acomplished sim has turned into the only sim to have. Visually stunning, best car physics of any sim by far and as for sound, have out braked myself so many times as was to busy listening to the Zackspeed Capri cackling its way down the straight, pure heaven, this sim rocks!!! Sector3 have been faultless in their comitment to not only make an authentic driving experience but you get that personal touch the development team are happy to answer questions individually, help to solve problems and keeping us up to date with future content, taking on suggestions and ideas. Got to say I'm hooked to both the sim and the ever growin community on the forum! All this and you can drive for free, test any car before you buy and when you do buy that car you've always dreamt of hammering around the track, it's worth every penny! Highly recommend this sim, leagues above the rest (got 'em all) come join a revolultion in driving. You will not be disappointed.
745	0	a	It SimBin game, so it's good. But problem is...  Game is too expensive! Single track is about 5 euros! I would buy full game for normal price. But I won't pay single cent in microtransactions system.
8590	1	a	I rarely write reviews for games but I feel the developers deserve one for this game. When R3E launched it wasn't that great - it wasn't bad but it was missing something, it didn't feel quite right and I could never get into it, but I did see some potential. It was free so whatever.   As time went on Sector3/Simbin kept updating the game adding content and listening to feedback and things started to get a bit better, but still, I couldn't get into it - Until recently that is.   Since December 2014 when a big patch was released R3E has gone from 'Best of the Rest' of racing simulators to a genuine contender. The driving physics are now really rather good, the cars feel nice to drive and they all do what you expect them to do. The sounds are second to none. Force feedback has improved dramatically, you can feel bumps in the road and can tell how much grip you have, even to the point where I can tell which wheel is losing grip. There are lots of options to tweak the FFB to your liking, but some of the sliders are a little confusing and there isn't much of a descriptions for what they actually do. Thankfully out of the box my Driving Force GT wheel felt good - I upped the strength and set a few options that I like to have just as personal preference but it didn't require much tweaking to get it to feel how I wanted it to.   The AI, although not prefect is pretty good. They drive fair, will try to overtake you if they are faster, will try to defend if you are quicker, sometimes they make mistakes and will out-brake themselves or run wide. You'll see them squabble for position with each other. Rfactor 2 and GSCE probably have the most realistic AI, but the AI in R3E is not far behind.  The Graphics are really quite good cars look realistic tracks are very detailed and look great, smoke and dust effects hang around in the air for a while and are nice and smooth. The lighting is very well done and there are several times of day to choose from. Driving under trees you get flashes of sunlight lighting up the cockpit and glinting off other cars. It all looks very good and add to what is already quite an immersive experience. Some of the older cars look a little dated (older as in released in 2013) but the newer stuff looks really good. It is is a great looking sim.   There is a lot of content to be had here ~65 cars and 20 tracks (48 layouts). It isn't cheap, at the moment to buy EVERYTHING it would cost around £130, But compared to something like iRacing where to buy everything will cost you probably 5X as much plus the subscription as well it is very well priced. In both games you don't need to buy everything anyway. Once you've got the tracks you want then you should be all set and with the discounts you get when buying packs you can get most of the tracks for a really good price, plus if you already bought content that is in a pack then it gets discounted automatically for you so you never end up having to pay for anything twice.  You can test drive any car as much as you like, and there are competitions to win prizes and they often dot require you to own the content to enter. just choose the competition and click GO, you can win virtual money in some of the competitions as well as simracing gear.  If I have one gripe with the store, it is that if you've bought a car from one of the 'Experiences' the adac GT Experience for example, then you have to buy skins in order to race those cars in other series - which is annoying and confusing. I already own the Audi R8 LMS Ultra and I want to race that car in a custom race then I have to pay an extra 79vrp to get a skin to make that car work. I shouldn't have to buy a skin to convert a car from one class to another. To be fair a skin is like 50p to buy so its not lots of money, but it still feels like I've been robbed of my content. talking of Skins, you cannot make custom skins for you cars. - It would be great if They opened up the skins to the community   The options menu is plentiful and has support for multiple monitors in eyefinity or NV Surround, but you cant change the FOV for the side monitors so you get a bit of distortion to the sides but it not too noticeable when racing. all the keys and buttons are re-mappable and it supports multiple input devices so you can use a variety of controllers all at the same time.  Multiplayer racing at the moment is limited to the Sector 3's own servers and as such is really limited. If you want to run GT cars around a particular track in Multiplayer you cant set up your own server, you just have to hope sector3 have a server set up with that combination, BUT there is a patch coming next week that should add dedicated servers to the game and I'll update this review once they come out and I've had a play on them.  I wouldn't have recommended this game a few months ago. there were far better sims out there to play and without any multiplayer R3E just wasn't quite good enough to put any time into. But now that it has been improved, fixed, fettled and tuned it really is a great racing simulator I imagine when Dedicated Servers are released you should be able to truly enjoy the racing in this game.
8592	1	a	This is the most complete racing experience imo! You can easilly make your own custom championships with a wide variety of series to choose from. Really good physics and visuals, and with the most bad ♥♥♥ sounds of all!! An awesome and immersive experience.  A tip is to buy vRP's here to get discounts:   https://www.raceroomstore.com/shop_de/list_page?cat=24   And a good idea is also to pick up an experience like DTM 2013 or ADAC GTM 2014 on a sale, this will give you cheap access to a bunch of tracks to start off with.  And buy content in packs, that will save you a lot of money.  It does need some more work. Mainly with some key features still missing, and the AI should need some more personality. But S3S are working hard, and there are many new longed for features and content on the way!  Why not give it a shot with the free content, and then buy what you like. There are also free competitions where you can try out new tracks and cars, and sometimes also win vRP's or nice prizes.
8594	1	a	  RaceRoom is a Free2Play made by Simbin (now know as SECTOR 3), developers of the great GTR Series and Race07. The game is a sim racing game, mostly aimed for that kind of people who are seeking for some realistic fun, rather than some arcadsh-ish driving. The game since it's Free, doesn't give you every cars and tracks. At first, you only get 11 cars, which is a nice number, considering before you only had like 3 cars if i'm not mistaken. Cars by groups:   *Silhouette Series: Cougar C14-1 Cougar C14-2 Canhard R52 Canhard R51  *P1 Prototype Series: DMD P20 Mistral M530  *P2 Prototype Series: DMD P21 Mistral M531  *Aquila CR1 Cup: Aquila CR1 Sports GT  *GTR 1 Series: Saleen S7R  *HillClimb challenge 134 Judd V8  So yeah, nice stuff after all, about the Tracks, the game only gives you 3 Tracks:  *RaceRoom RaceWay: Comes with 5 LayOuts  *PortiMao Circuit: Comes with 4 LayOuts  *LakeView HillClimb: Comes with 2 LayOuts  Not that many of tracks, considering only 2 of those are played (actually, i think the HillClimb one can only be playable on SinglePlayer, not sure. For get more cars or tracks, you can either buy the single cars or tracks (but this will make you spend more money since they're quite pricey) or you can buy the packages wich comes with both Cars and Tracks. My Advice is to buy the ADAC GT 2014 and the Nurburgring Legends, if possible DTM 2014 as well. Also, i suggest you to get them from the RaceRoom store. Over there, they cost less thanks to the sales. There's 90% of times always one every month soo, you'd better prepare at least 13$ if you want the ADAC GT 2014 for example. Anyways! Yeah, the game is indeed nice. The Graphics are looking pretty, the quality of the Tracks is Top Notch, Online isn't as Dreadful as i thought, Most of people playing, ain't that crazy at all or do stupid ♥♥♥♥♥ on track and at last, The ForceFeedback is also very well done. I'm using a Logitech Driving Force EX and it goes perfect with the game. Screw those mixed reviews. These are mostly because of people's who want all the cars free or because they think RaceRoom it's like GranTurismo lol or because of the costs of the DLC's, which i think, it's fair considering if you count them all, you get the price of an AAA+ Complete Sim Racing Game, so it's kind of buying the game but in pieces. So, should you try the game? Yes, if possbile with a Wheel + Pedals for the best experience but a controller will be nice as well   
8596	1	a	'Two trump cards in R3E (RaceRoom) hand' SOUND &amp; FFB (Force FeedBack) what gives feel around reality racing!  p.s. I love FFB from ISI, REIZA, KUNOS, iR, but R3E has best! same about SOUND! for example, take SLS AMG GT3 you can take adrenaline hear him sound in PIT without drive :D
747	0	a	there is only a couple of challenges and you have to buy alot of the cars and tracks to complete them.
8598	1	a	Definitely worth recommending! The graphics are very good and so are the driving physics. It's advertised as a 'free 2 play' game, however most of the content is not. It doesn't mean that you have to buy it though. I love the fact that you can win a lot of stuff in competitions, full packs like DTM 2014 or ADAC 2014 or VRP which you can use to buy anything that is available in the game.  The game still lacks some features, for example weather changes or a proper career mode, but I believe that this will be changed sooner or later because we have already received a lot of updates, which improved the overall experience.  A really great game, MOST of the people, who gave bad reviews had played for just a couple of hours (sometimes even less), which is definitely not enough to get a real grip of the game.  
748	0	a	The game itself is absolutely fantastic and unlike many others I do think, that giving away a free base game and then charging for expansion packs is a fair deal. But what is really ruining all of this, is the fact that you are forced to be connected to the internet all the time. If you force players to be always online, yet don´t have a properly working server structure, then it is a death sentence. People can´t access the stuff they paid for for days. As a customer I feel betrayed, because these guys know how to design a racing game. Nice physics, great sounds, fun AI, good enough graphics. What a shame.
8600	1	a	Great game, great feel, great tracks, AI gets harder the better you drive, only set backs are the cost of the game goes from free to over $200 Aus, although if they sell a package and you own part of what is in the pakage they discount it, the other problems are its unable to have any mods, and connecting to game server can take a life time or time out completely, get over these small down falls and the game is awesome to play, and most mates who see the unlocked version of the game, go home and install it.
8602	1	a	Great but unfinished game that gets better with every update. I was looking for an alternative to GTR2 and RRE is slowly but surely turning into that (same devs after all). No 'rewinds', no bumping into other cars without severe consequences (spin), no drifting through corners at 250 kph... Perfect! Love it!  IT IS NO 'Need for speed' or 'Grid2' ('Grid Autosport' was an arcady desaster as well imho). IT IS NOT A GAMEPAD-CASUAL-RACER.  The DTM Experience is great if you are a fan of the DTM Series but as mentioned above feels a little unfinished (no weather change, car setups can't be saved,...). With the last patch there is a multiplayer (Alpha) in both DTM and RRE and tons of other improvements. I can't understand these negative reviews because the best about the game: It's free to try out. I can download and play parts of it without paying anything. And if you love it as much as I do you can buy the stuff you like and want... This game will be the next GTR2 once it's finished. I am really looking forward to each update... Pit stops are announced for the near future!
8604	1	a	Absolutely love race room racing experience. Along with Assetto Corsa, these are the driving sims I have been looking for. I have always played driving games like Forza, Grid, F1, NFS &amp; various Rally games on consoles then recently got Project cars. At first I really liked Project Cars graphics, Car selection and tracks selection but in my opinion the games play ability was my problem. I tried playing it with an Xbox controller which I found very frustrating and no fun at all. I was told to buy a steering wheel for the ultimate experience. So after a couple of months and much frustration, I said what the hell &amp; bought a £270 steering wheel which is compatible with Xbox and PC. Project Cars was actually much better but I just did not like the game play and car feel on track. As my new steering wheel was also PC compatible I started to look for driving sims on Steam. This is where I found Race Rooms. It was a breath of fresh air. At first, I thought it can't be any good if it's free but I wanted to test my steering wheel out so I downloaded it. OMG! Fell in love straight away. This was the game I was looking for. Excellent graphics, great car choice, great tracks, easy to operate and fantastic game play. No more dodgy handling like Project Cars.   To enjoy this game to the max, you need a good steering wheel with force feedback.  A couple of months ago I was a bit reluctant to buy a wheel for so much money and was concerned about where to set it up. Anyway I gave in and bought one from Amazon and converted my home office. Best thing I have ever done for gaming. I haven't touched my Xbox One console in months. Recently I have even bought Assetto Corsa too. These are my best racing sims at present which I feel comfortable with and can control on the track.   I have bought all the tracks and several car packs. On occasions there are weekend discount deals which can save you money. Also, buy VRP credit from Race Room website direct because you get more VRP then buying add-ons directly from Steam.   Also, you MUST have Internet connection to play this game.   Anyway, I would defiantly recommend this game with a good steering wheel with force feed back and a nice sound setup. No sim game is perfect out there right now because we all like and want different experiences. One mans meat is another mans gravy!
749	0	a	Too little content available for the free-to-use customer
8606	1	a	Still not a fan of the free 2 play model, but I am glad it hasn't stopped me from playing the awesome new content and experience the overhaul on the physics since the last time I tested R3E at release.   With the (innovative) multiplayer being in place and working like a charm I can now finally call this game the true successor of RACE 07. Maybe RACE 15 should be trademarked as the touring cars are superb for super close online racing. Still only a few hours of online play in but this will grow massively in the coming months.  Welcome  back Simbin  Sector3 to my extensive virtual motorsport games library on Steam :)
8608	1	a	+ acceptable and highly enjoyable physics quality. + Astonishing sounds beyond anything.     - A pricing model which is deserve to be killed who had invented this system.
8610	1	a	In a nutshell, this game combines the best features of other sims and puts them together in one fantastic package. I'd like my review to start on 1 aspect that has taken a lot of criticism, and that is price.  Here is my experience:  I bought £25 worth of vRP's (the ingame currency) and with it purchased the following: 90% of the tracks, DTM '13 pack, and a car from most of the other classes.  I have yet to see a multiplayer game i can't join with the content I own and I have countless hours of entertainment ahead of me with the custom championships I can make with all the different classes.  All of this with £25 which compares very favourably with other sims out there. So I absolutely disagree with criticism that it is too expensive, you just need to be smart with how you buy. (A quick note with how to get discounts, is you must always buy 1 pack at a time, to see the discount for duplicate content reflected in the next pack you buy).  On the subject of gameplay, as i say it's amazing, the FFB is powerful and very informative, at the same level (or better) than RF2's FFB which is regarded as the holy grail of FFB). Physics feel very realistic the cars feel controllable, you don't feel like you're gonna die on every corner which some sims do. The tires have a grippiness that is lacking in other sims and when you push them over the limit, you can feel (and hear) them fighting for grip whilst still being controllable in a drift. Drifting the 4wd cars is an absolute blast! The sounds are absolutely industry leading and the sense of immersion is just incredible. Put it this way, once you play RRE, you realise there is more to sim racing audio than just engine noise and tire squeal. (and some don't even do those very well)  Multiplayer is a big positive too, you can always find a game running and i really like how it is implemented. Players may only join in practise and quali sessions which means you don't have randoms coming in the middle of a race and wrecking you intentionally or not because they don't really care about the current session. Anyone in a race has skin in the game and I've yet to see anyone driving in a careless or trolling manner. Another great thing is the netcode is really good as well as the fact that contacts are handled well. In Assetto corsa for example, if you scrape some paint off someones car, the car will behave like it's been blown up by hand grenade! Not here, contacts are handled in a realistic and believable manner and makes close racing much more enjoyable and competitive.  So go ahead and try the free content, I have no doubt once you do, you will be heading straight to the store page for your first pack!
8612	1	a	Best racing game out there. Only issue is how much I've spent on cars. Sounds are the BEST of any racing game currently on the market, every car drives fantastic, physics are great, etc etc. Damage model is a bit lacking but the overall gameplay and quality over ride that. I was pretty active on iRacing before a friend recommended this game to me, and I haven't raced a race on iRacing since. VERY HARD TO BEAT
750	0	a	Bottom line? Good racing game/sim with plenty of potential.  The constant micro-transactions start to get annoying. Even with sales on content packs and moderate discounts for purchasing vRP (virtual money) to buy content, the game ends up costing you quite a bit more than what you get at the stage of development it is in. People can deny or challenge all they want but this thing has been in a perpetual state of Beta for 4 years. It's actually unfortunate Steam 'GreenLights' products in this state. They really should be 'buyer beware'.  All the content including topping up everytime something new is released whether it's a car, pack or tracks can end up costing in the neighborhood of $200.00. Many will argue that but I have the receipts to prove it and unless you figure out the system or have someone explain, many players have inevitably made errors as to how they purchased and paid more than they could have.  The drivng itself feels quite good. Since it is a closed system, there is no easy way to inspect what is being done to see how accurate the physics, vehicle dynamic modeling or tire modeling is done. While there are moments it feels slightly weird, certain cars lifeless or canned, it certainly is not as obvious or bad as some other well known racing games.  Visually, for a DX9 based engine, they have produced a great result. It is missing any kind of rubber build up or active track at least visually. There is some debris modeling if going off road but no visuals.  There is no proper flag system. There is no daytime, nightime transitions or full 24 hour system. Damage modeling is non-existent which lends to very pushy, bumping and careless driving in multiplayer sessions. There is some mild engine and gearbox damage with specific vehicles.  Pits and setups are limited. No tire pressure adjustment at the moment and limited chassis setup. The ability to 'Save' a setup only recently became available and oddly was news as though this was a breakthrough of epic proportions.  http://www.racedepartment.com/threads/setup-saving-coming-to-r3e.118058   The game models chassis flex.  The options allow for tweaking the visuals, controllers, sound and force feedback to the Nth degree. There are some interesting concepts to the steering and force feedback settings to simulate the rack and pinion steering as well as the feel of the contact of the tire to the road. How much of that truly can be felt in the game or whether it's placebo is difficult to tell though it does feel generally good in most cars.  The sounds are really well done. Every other game could learn from this.  Multiplayer is okay when it works but often there are visual glitches with cars overlapping or stationary images (ghost images) just kind of being left behind around the track. It needs work.  It requires an internet connetion and there is no offline mode which is fine except the authentication servers or whatever they are frequently blow up and and one cannot play.  The dedicated forums away from the Steam discussions have unfortunately become progressively toxic only rivaled by iracing. I find it to be a deterrent since it is somewhat the 'go to' for info but weeding through the frequent snarky responses to everything and the jerks gets old really quick.  Compared to turn key options such as AMS though dated in some ways, at least can be dropped into a league and work and rF2 which is also league capable, this still has a long way to go. If one tries it solely on the free content, I suppose it's okay but it will get repetitive very quickly. Even with all the content, hot lapping against AI gets old and other than the built in public Multiplayer Lobby which leaves much to be desired and you won't find much that's worth the time.  As much as I enjoy driving the game and I'll say it again, it has potential, in the current state along with past issues as Simbin, restructuring and the advent of Sector3 and another restructuring along with the rebirth of Simbin, I cannot recommend it. They have missed the mark, there seems to be no direction to what should be the logical and that is a massive multiplayer environment and the reality of it being at 'Beta' levels after 4 years with no end in sight is enough to at least be cautious with this before diving in head first and spending a lot of money.
751	0	a	This game has a great potential as a NFS, Forza or GT killer. But unfortunately it has no multiplayer, you are stuck only at one car, and you just race alone with ghost car which made this game more boring..   When I first played this game last year I thought that this will be the online racing game with complete features to enjoy without spending any penny, but I was wrong. Of course there's a microtransaction to be able to unlock those, and I have a feeling that this game would become a pay-to-win just like other F2P games out there.   Honestly, I won't recommend this game to anyone.
8614	1	a	This game has come leaps and bounds beyond where it used to be. As it stands now, RaceRoom Racing Experience (R3E) is a fantastic sim that is easy to get into and fun while still being realistic and tricky.  The biggest thing you'll notice immediately compared to other racing titles is the sound. Oh lawdy the sound. No game comes even close to the quality of R3E sounds in every area and best of all they are still regularly updated and improved!  Physics in R3E is where a lot of the 'purists' will decry it for not being harsh enough, not being mean enough, not punishing you hard enough for mistakes, but I find all of that as a positive not a negative. The physics feel just as tight and clean as the other major racing sim titles without being as punishing as some of the more 'popular' options.  Force Feedback (FFB) has always felt decent in R3E but used to be more of a mixed back for many wheel users. The most recent update addressed this by adjusting the defaults for many common wheels (I use a G27 and it now feels great right away) based on feedback from the community. The results are great and the FFB now needs much less fiddling for the finicky users and feels better than ever on default settings.  Content pricing is usually a big issue for most people, but considering the high quality of the cars and tracks the price they ask is very reasonable. Not to mention the price is lower than some other games with similar pricing models.  All in all there's no real downside to at least downloading it and trying it as there are free tracks and free cars avaialble for anyone to use along with time trial competitions that run for 1-2 months at a time. You just have to try it! =D
8616	1	a	  Great game.  Decent graphics (getting better with every new car and track), great FFB, great tracks, great cars. Awesome to have series like WTCC, DTM or GT Masters in the game. Also some other nice car classes (GT1, GT2, GT3 (the GT3 class is just awesome!), TT Cup, GP2, F4 and so on...) and pretty cool classic content (DTM 1992, Group 5, Touring Classics, GTO...). The AI is maybe the best AI in every current racing game and gets improvements with every patch.
8618	1	a	A great sim you can make into your own,  Pros - A game made by people who have made some of the best racing games/sims in the early noughties GTR GTR2 -Theres something for everybody in the Raceroom portal (and theres always a nice discount from time to time) -Good phsyics and good car models that seem very accurate to there real life counterparts -Good FFB on par with other racing simulations and getting better with each new update -lots of options in the menus for graphics, handling, FFB (Make the game as sim/hardcore as you want or as casual as you want)  Cons - Adaptive A.I needs some work as it can be 12 seconds faster than you one race, and 5 seconds slower the next - &lt;&lt;&lt;Always online&gt;&gt;&gt; even if you are just a A.I singleplayer racer or just like to get in those perfect practice/test laps on the track, if the servers crash you cant play your content offline or if you share wireless and you disconnect, so does the game (although the developers have talked about the possibility of offline in the future theres been no news on if or when it will be a feature)
8620	1	a	RaceRoom is mainly aimed at people who watch events like DTM, WTCC and GT Masters on TV. If you are not one of these people there's a risk you won't understand or appreciate the value of this content, since it's very much tied to real-life racing.  R3E is one of the best sim racing games around. The attention that Sector 3 applies to every single car and track impresses me all the time. Like all sims the game is best enjoyed with a wheel or perhaps a miniwheel racing controller, however I've tried the game with a regular gamepad and keyboard, and the game still plays really well.   Their business model gives you the basic stuff for free, you then pay for the extra content you want. The prices are reasonable considering how much depth each car offers. The game has three levels of technical difficulty: arcade, sim-arcade and simulation. So you don't have to be a racing game prodigee to enjoy this game.  The AI seems to adapt according to what racing event you are doing: it is quite aggressive in DTM and WTCC, which is consistent with the corresponding real-life events, while it is less aggressive in the custom championships.  RaceRoom aims for accessibility; anyone with an 'OK' PC should be able to play these games.  On the negative side: the game does not explain things like setting up pit stops, the adaptive AI system does not work particularily well, the game site can be clumsy to navigate through.  On the whole it's a great racing game that offers content that is different from Stock Car/Automobilista, Project Cars, Assetto Corsa and other sim games.
8622	1	a	Not bad for a free game, cars are amazing. But you have to pay for more tracks and its singleplayer only.
8624	1	a	I really think this model works. Take me e.g., I mainly play with 80s vehicles so why would I want a bunch of modern GT3 cars? Here I can buy what I want to play, just like with the Race-series. FF is as good as any other sim-racer. You really feel the car and as it should be you can't just put your foot down in a middle of a corner.   I honestly don't understand people that rates it down because you have to pay for extra content. I guess they wanted all of it for free, which of course is not possible with a AA-title.  I play a lot of racing sims and this is highly recommended. If you are a serious racer, you should atleast try it.  
8626	1	a	As of 10/09/2014 after the latest update this game is fantastic.   I just hope some people will change their reviews now to more possitive ones :)
8628	1	a	I simply cant get enough of Raceroom....and even after trying 'the next big racing game' I keep coming back to raceroom time and time again....Great graphics without all the sparkly bits. Awesome in your face sound and some of the best FFB out there...  Do I recommend it...yes! Should you give it a go...Hell yes!  and remember - initially it's free, and all cars are able to be test-driven before purchase, so dont like it, dont buy it....although, once your hooked - I bet you will!
8630	1	a	Its free. The physics are awesome. The free cars are awesome. The cars you pay for are even better. Its like a DCS of the racing world. All that being said, races that involve free tracks + free cars = a ♥♥♥♥♥how, but its not like it wasnt expected. Just download it and have fun.
8632	1	a	As a user of some racecims (mostrly iRacing and rFactor2) I think my review will help who wants some real physics. I've raced in RaceRoom experience (the free content) but I'm very tempted to get some paid ones.  • It's a pretty decent game. It tries hard to be a sim but in 'Get Real' the cars are still harder to get damage by crashes than in real world and misses some rules or safety points for multiplayer - like iRacing does very very well.  • Supports steering wheels and FFB. • You can try it free. • You can do a test drive in paid cars before decide to buy it or not.  Cons: • Should have something like safety points - people get no penalty for intentional wrecking or irresponsible behavior • Some guys going wrong way all race long without being disqualified(hopefully no one would buy some content to do that) • Off-track slowdown penalty is a bit exagerated
8634	1	a	One of the most underated Sim out there. Whats hidden behind the 'free to play' aspect is more worthy of a full price because all the content is worth it.   CARS:The cars are all well done and balanced so that there isnt always a dominate car but at the same time true to the real life behaviors. A great variety of racing cars, from power heavy turbo cars of the 70's and 80's to modern GT3 cars to Leman prototypes. Official series are represented, DTM, GT Masters, WTCC and more coming... feel free to test drive them all, buy what you like.  TRACKS:The tracks are well created from scratch to the point you dont care about laser scanned tracks, even though they are just beginning to utilize laser scan technology into there future tracks. The Sim doesnt allow modding, which from my opinion is a bit redundent since the other sims out there allow it but quality wise dont represent well, leaving you wanting more official quality tracks from the developer. With each track released the detail and quality is maintained, not some hack job addon.   MULTIPLAYER: One the best online racing experiences and just getting warmed up. Netcode is very good, even when racing some from the US all the way in Germany, they use a p2p connection, so close racing is possible, being able to squeeze between two cars or riding the back bumper of your opponent is amazing. Currently right now its open servers with rotating tracks, hosting a practice, qualifying and then a short sprint race. In a matter of weeks they will release dedicated servers, allowing any choice of car and track along with many of the standard features.  SINGLEPLAYER: Each official series supports the real life formats. If thats not your thing you can create your own championship, picking your own format and track calendar.   AI: Rated among the best, making a good training tool of racing hard and bumper to bumper, but be aware, be on your A game, otherwise they will punish you. There will be times they run into the back of you but thats usually because you braked too early or took the wrong racing line, so awareness isnt always there top attribute. You can choose a set pace for the AI or choose the adaptive AI and watch there speed grow with you. It isnt perfect but as they move through development, it improves.  SOUNDS: The best, you can ask anyone, even those who race in other sims, all agree RaceRoom has the most immersive detailed sounds currently. They are constantly improving them as well, adding more detail to the car and track ambient. If you dont believe me, check on Youtube and turn up the volume.  GRAPHICS: A very clean and colorful look, with motion blur that actually makes it seem like your going fast. Its improved over the past year and as usual constantly being optimized. The cars definitely fit the tracks in detail, unlike some games where the car or track look better than the other. Partnered with the sounds, its quite the visual experience. Runs well on medium range PC's but does not support SLI or crossfire yet. The game supports different times of day, sunrise to sunset, which looks beatiful across the track.  HARDWARE: They support just about every wheel out there or wheel pedal combinations. FORCE FEEDBACK: At a glance the ffb features are overwhelming to tune, but there are many guides and user profiles to build off of. Once you have it tuned its quite a unique feeling, driving the heavy turbo cars is a handful and the modern GT3's handle with weight but finesse. They are always working towards improving the ffb and experience. My advice is patience and try out the various tweaks out there.  Final thoughts: This is a great hidden Sim that doesnt get the recognition it deserves. Most people dont believe in the free to play aspect and thats understandable, push that asside and you got something great in your hands. I advise to download and test drive the cars your interested in. Price range isnt too expensive, cheaper than iRacing but like I said its worth the price if you were to buy assetto corsa or Project cars. One thing many people miss is the fact once you buy a official series pack, you own the tracks, you no longer have to purchase them in the other packs, your only paying for the cars. My motto is build the game you want, buy the cars and tracks you like and go from there, once you try them you will want them all. Give it a fair try and enjoy the experience.  With whats ahead content and feature wise, the future is bright, so dont miss out.  Have a look at my Youtube channel to see what RaceRoom Racing Experience is all about.  http://www.youtube.com/c/224lemans 
8636	1	a	Now with Multiplayer! This game has one of the best netcodes I have ever seen in a racing game. Racing online feels almost like racing offline against real people, no lag, no warping and no strange collision clipping... with 24 drivers. Of course this is only true if everybody has a decent internet connection. Even the best netcodes can't fix slow/broken internet :p  Even with only the free content it's a lot of fun but the game encourages you to buy more. The price of the content is okay, not too expensive but not cheap too. Tracks and cars are on sale from time to time and now with the addition of content packs you could get some bargains. I for one don't need any car and track because I have my facourites which I want to drive. Buying them costs less than other sims. Especially with rFactor 2 and iRacing which both need subscriptions to play them online.  With the 3 physics levels (Novice, Amateuer, Get Real) there is one level for everyone from total beginner to simpro.
8638	1	a	I would highly recommend this if it wasn't Free to Play, wait for the discounts as that is the only time you should invest in the packs. Otherwise it gets too pricey compared to other racing titles that're out. It's a great sim, just pricey if you want a decent amount of content.  Pros: Like every other SimBin title, the physics are excellent. Loads of options for the Races, Sounds, FFB, and other things that other devs overlook. I have to mention the sound design, it's one of the best out there right vnow!  Cons: Besides the F2P aspect, my only other gripe is the 'Adaptive AI' option, I don't recommend using it. It sounds like a cool idea, but it needs work. They either brake-check you down straights or simply just crash into you like they didn't know you were there. Maybe they need to be trained for some time, but it's best to just use the other AI option to save the agro.
8640	1	a	Since the last 2 updates, RRRE has transformed into an amazing sim. I absolutely love it and for me it is the best out there. Now I've got everything dialed in, I'm having so much fun with this. Thank you Sector 3 keep up the good work.
8642	1	a	After trying out lots of current sims (Project Cars, Assetto Corsa, Dirt rally, Stock Car Exreme etc) I still wasnt satisfied! So my search continued - at first I looked back and played on some old sims.  Rfacator 1 with DTM and Blancpain mods and also Race Injection with all add ons! THIS is what im talking about, over the top tin tops going hell for leather in believable envirnoments - so much more than cars just driving around tracks, these old sims have a lot of character.  So I started looking for a suitable up to date equal. RRE is just that! I didn't think too much of the demo content, but went ahead and bought the DTM 2013 experience. It is so satisfying, great selection of tracks, cars, and game modes. A proper championship to conquer, race against ghost cars from the leaderboards, a competion for fastest lap (with a prize of DTM 2014 for winners). There is so much content that I will actually play and enjoy here!  Pros  Free demo Content starts at a very reasonable price - dont buy it all at once, buy one experience Great AI Great physics Outstanding sound Great performance on Win 10  Cons Graphics look slightly dated, worse than Assetto and Pcars but better than almost everything else Multiplayer still in alpha, it works, but its not as good as IRacing (what is!) Confusing pay model, it is simple in essence, but add ons are avail from steam and direct from publisher too  My rating:  Graphics Nothing offensive, but nothing earth shattering either 8/10  Sound Amazing, RRE leads the field, nothing can touch it 10/10  AI Very convincing, much better than AC and PCars 9/10  Value Free to start playing and very reasonable prices for DLC 9/10  Feel Good physics, they dont feel cheap or incorrect in any way Nice FFB, everything is there, nothing is jarring or over done Handling feels more forgiving that AC but not as easy as PCars 9/10  Overall 85% - Dont judge just from the free content, splash out on an 'experience' (DTM 2013 was cheapest for me £7.80 at time of writing) and really see what this game is capable of!  This will be my next purchase for this game ;)   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK50O-PXrrU   
8644	1	a	This is my favourite Race Sim of the lot. Great graphics. Great AI A fantastic selection of tracks The best sounding Race Sim in the business.  If you're a serious sim racer then this is the game for you.
8646	1	a	Ok this game had a bad start, but as it stands today it is a worthy followup to the famous Race '07 series.  Keep up the good work!
8648	1	a	Great game with amazing controls, I'd reccomend it to anyone who really wants to get deep down and experience some amazing cars with some even more amazing sounds, eargasmic collosal fun!
8650	1	a	hell lot of fun. mostlikly i am first, cuz i am good. would love to see a handful of normal cars aswell. price for cars/tracks is okay from my side. no bugs, multiplayer is smooth and i havent got any problems with it yet. nice game
8652	1	a	My #2 next to Project Cars. I simply wish there was a safety car, weather and time progression and dynamic road surface (rubbering etc.). There is just something about night racing. Granted the casual player would not even bother with these features, this is for the more dedicated hard core player. Seems when it comes to racing games there is a trade off that needs to be made between fun and seriousness, in my opinion this is a pure racing simulator and it doesn't try to be anything else. All cars are race spec, there are no road cars, no parts to buy for the car, no livery editor, etc. You get real life counter parts from real series mimicked ala iRacing.  The sound is fantastic, the feel of the cars is much improved over the early beta days, the visiual presentation is fantastic albeit a bit dated (DirectX 9). Overall it gives a fantastic race experience that with hopeful VR support be extremely immersive. The studio has a lot of talent and great foundation to make a next generation simulator in the future. Hopefully they realize their vision in the next iteration, I can only hope that the backend gets replaced while the game stays the same title, no need for a RRRE2, just keep it RRRE and keep improving what is already there.  I highly recommend it, if you do try this out, hop in the sillhoutte series cars at the raceroom raceway track (both awesome car and track!) and be sure to use a while, you loose a lot of immersion and feel of the game using a game pad or keyboard, its not gonna give you a poor experience. A G25 works perfect here.  I have bought nearly all the content for the game and I am not even upset, you can get vRP from the raceroom store, which is cheaper than buying the cars and tracks within the game, first get the vRP reedem it in the game then buy the packs it will save you a lot of money. I recommend buying the packs that have cars and tracks in them, then the track packs then car packs as you wish. It will maximize the content and getting the 10K vRP for 60$ yields you nearly 90% of the content. This is not different than buying any modern game now, just wish they made it simpler than this.
8654	1	a	This game is so amazing.  Go on game.raceroom.store reedem code is RQR32LT-AM8UGP9-GTCY22V-EKBP8DG TYPE this in on vRP. You vil now have 500vRP. Now you can purchase new cars, packs and tracks:-)  Hi HI:-)
8656	1	a	The best racing simulator . I can say pCars is just a ♥♥♥♥ing joke after trying this awesome simulator . BEST SOUND AND BEST FFB EVER,DAMN !!  (TEST WITH T300RS)
8658	1	a	Raceroom Racing Experience was my first racing sim.   I noticed R3E when steam presented me an ad for the DTM 1992 pack, featuring the Mercedes 190E. Since my first car was a Mercedes 190E and I've been watching the DTM since 1992 I had to get the game and DTM 1992 pack.  My first steps in the game were kinda rough. I only had an xbox controller and other than that no clue about racing.  I went to the Sector3 forums and got immediate help. Not just the usual Buy a wheel kind of advice. Also advice on how to play with a controller.  Ever since my first experiences with R3E I got Assetto Corsa, Project Cars, iRacing and a wheel.  People generally seem to complain about the payment system. I don't really understand what the problem is. For Assetto Corsa or Project Cars you have to pay about $50 on steam when it's not on sale and then you still have to buy DLC if you want to.   R3E is free to play unlike the other sims. Ok, the free version only comes with a handful of cars and no real life tracks, but you can buy every single track and car individually or in packs. In iRacing you also have to buy cars and tracks individually but on top of that you have to subscribe to use their service.   R3E's multiplayer mode has been suffering in the past, however, it's constantly being improved. My personal experience wasn't very good in the beginning. I had high ping and was constantly ghosting. That issue has been fixed and in the last few online races I haven't had any issues at all.   Raceroom or Sector3 is constantly working on new content, improving the physics, and working on fixing multiplayer issues.  It might not be as shiney as Project Cars is, might not have a multiplayer base like iRacing has, but it has a sound which makes the cars sound like cars, has good physics, force feedback, official licenses for DTM, WTCC, ADAC GT Masters and a growing user and fan base.   
8660	1	a	RaceRoom is all about authentic world class racing series. If you are the type to get excited about simulating WTCC, DTM and GT World Championship auto racing then this game will definitely impress ! Physics are outstanding - the road feel is very prominent and the suspension action is quite noticeable. Audio sounds are the best I have ever experienced bar none ! The experience packages are a warranted pay scheme because the level of detail and customization possible with this game warrants the pricing on these packs. The game is built by a small dedicated outfit from Sweden and their communication via their forums with the games fans is outstanding. Highly recommended racing sim !!
8662	1	a	My first review 3 years ago was appropriately negative. The game was an overpriced hotlapping app given the absence of AI opponents. Now the game is my favorite racing simulation (play it more than Assetto Corsa and Project Cars right now). I'm so glad I gave it a second chance.  Heard about the massive update in November so I reinstalled the game and ran a few races and I was hooked. The physics model is very much improved since 2013. Combine this with remarkably better FFB and it's basically a new game. I took advantage of the Black Friday deal and now have all the cars and tracks. Love running the ADAC GT, DTM, Audi Sport TT, and WTCC cars. Tracks are nicely modeled and have excellent nuances including bumps and curbs. I especially like how well they model the loss of grip when you crest a hill. You can really feel the wheels lift and the car lose grip.   The AI is very good. Just run a few races and allow the adaptive AI to adjust to your skill and you'll be impressed. I really appreciate how imperfect the AI can be, making realistic mistakes and getting into trouble yet not careless and running you off the road. Significantly better than the AI in Assetto Corsa or Project Cars. AI in those games feels like robots hotlapping in a perfect line. Especially Assetto Corsa - very boring AI.   Surprised to hear about so many technical issues in other reviews. Game runs beautifully for me. Graphics are gorgeous and fps are fast and smooth. I'm running an i7-6700k &amp; Geforce 980 Ti so most games fly. This game seems well optimized given the 30-40 AI cars with no stutter.   Overall this game has come a LOOOOONG way in almost 4 years. I went from being a harsh critic to huge fan. Says a lot about Sector3 Studio's commitment to making this game great.
8664	1	a	Great visuals, and Car Driving feel. Nice tracks and cars to choose from. and the controler support is welcomed. all cars feel as if they have there own charactoeristics. and track to cocpit, visual feedback is great. more so than any other games on the market. (have not played iRacing, nor will i ever) I have got all cars and tracks at sale prices only. I have saved 67% of the normal asking price for this game. and its worth every penny.
8666	1	a	Powerful piece of software. State of the art graphics, sound and technics. Game runs super smooth on maximum settings and controller support works perfect. ( i5 4670k haswell 8gb GTX660 Win7 xbox 360 controller ) Authentic and precise car models. The game really conveys a sense of breath taking speed. 100% adrenalin ejection, especially in multiplayer mode!  + graphics + sound + multiplayer support + variety of cars + good F2P content  - no offline mode - lack of soundtrack - single player content with very little substance  edit: 05/2016   + game has now music and it´s great! + vast amount of content was added.. new cars, tracks e.t.c. + fair pricing  after all RaceRoom has evolved and grown up.. impressiv work!  10/10
8668	1	a	Highly Recommend this title for its pure driving model, the raceing is good and i love the championships, it has it flaws GFX not as polished as some new titles but the feel i get in my cockpit through the wheel is great. Downside, cost for content just like iRacing it adds up so choose what you want carefully, i got DTM13 on special and was quite surprised just how good it feels and adjustability in game is great AI is pretty good. I only tried this because of the Dev teams History and Past wich traces back from SINBIN with GTR, RACE and such to Papy to my fav title of all time Grand Prix Legends. Dev is still on going with Multi player Alpha havnt tried yet but its growing.  The More Content i aquire the more impressed i am with how Great the Physics are from DTM RWD race cars to WTCC FWD lil rockets to the Hyper Power of the Zonder R they are just fantastic, you tend to over look the Graphics short falls for a bit. Never thought id get into WTCC FWD racing after 'RACE' and 'RACE07' but in RaceRoom the look and feel just great, i created my own championship ( as not all of the WTCC tracks are here a couple missing ) and its a FUN lil car to race the AI are actrually fantastic around Mid Ohip i was side by side with AI for 3 straight laps over cutting and undercutting eachother at ever corner with bearly a bump here n there was bloody awsome ive NEVER raced AI on ANY TITLE that allowed door to door wheel to wheel racing until now... UPDATE, Just keep getting better
8670	1	a	It's basically rFactor. So of course it has great driving physics. It feels solid real and you understand why you make a mistake. It's not like NFS where cars behave as if they had plastic wheels and were driving on plastic roads. Your car handles like it should, not like a Hot Wheels car. You put too much gas, you get punished. You brake too hard, you get punished. Just like in real. But once you master a car, it'll be easy for you to set a lap time. A clear, neat interface, great sound work, great driving physics, and very decent graphics. All for free. What's not to like? Too bad its new multiplayer is riddled with crashkids, who presumably be shot to death in real life if they did the same. Simbin also likes to stick their flag notifications in the middle of your screen, blocking the apex when in exterior cam. Other than that, go grab this already. And if you have the money, get the BMW GT2 and Audi R8 LMS, they're top notch cars.
8672	1	a	This is a great graphical upgrade to Simbins racing games and it still has one of the best physics models. It is a tad expensive to get all the content compared to other racing titles but if you wait for one of their big sales it's possible to get it all for around 120 dollars (and it's probably worth it for how great the driving is). It still beats the incredible expense of buying content and yearly memberships for iracing though. Crazy amount of money to play that game.  Just want to add that the best way to get content for the game (as others have said) is to buy VRP packages directly from the Raceroom store site (not the game site) then use the VRP when the game has one of their huge sales on. The way I bought content was to buy a couple of the packs when Steam had a really good sale on first. I then bought a VRP pack and used it on the Raceroom site when they had a 90% sale (they have these great sales a few times a year from what I've seen). Because I owned two of the larger packs already, I also got additional discounts. I managed to get all the packs on the site (except a couple of the single car packs), around 75% of the cars and all the tracks except 5 for around 85 dollars Canadian total. Keep in mind that Raceroom uses US dollars and my dollar was only worth about 72 cents and you see how cheap Raceroom can be if you live in the US. Definitely worth it in my opinion for this incredible sim.
8674	1	a	Well gotta say it's now my go to race sim , Cons purchacing process confusing and little pricey !! Pros too many lol very underated game !! The feel of cars, graphics and wow the sounds are awesome some features missing but are too be included in upcoming update i believe? If in doubt give it a try nothing to loose and everything to gain . If you played it long time ago give it another try all ready have 4 friends really enjoying it. (No idon't work for s3) just enjoying game
8676	1	a	This game is worth it to be called a Sim and Racing Experience ! and it's free to play (race)  but you really need a steering wheel, before i got my G27 it was unplayable, but now with it it's totally awesome... it feels realistic, the sounds are great force feedback is good and so on... unbelieveable that this game isn't in it's final stage
8678	1	a	Personally, i like this Game, even know there is only 5 free cars to choose from it is still quite fun, I also makes it fun if you play with a Steering Wheel, it makes it more enjoyable. 8/10
8680	1	a	Absolutely fantastic simulator! Highly recommended!
8682	1	a	Well what can i say regarding this game, only that it is Good. If they where more tracks and alot of different cars like the ones in Auto Club Revolution then maybe it would be a Brilliant game.
8684	1	a	Lets say, project cars, with less bugs?!
8686	1	a	Playing Raceroom since 6months now. Ever since the 1st metres i made in the free cars i was sold to the game. Now 6 months later i own most content (all tracks which are beauties - and most of the cars). The circuits are very well build and have a lively atmosphere around them which is in big contrast with the coolness of AssettoCorsa.. The big variety of cars each have their own charactheristics. From WTCC to DTM92, from Group 5 to prototypes, they are all very enjoyable if you succeed in taming them. Sounds are well, you automatically raise your volume..  The community of raceroom is very open, fair and sportive but competitive at the same time. Both on and offtrack. Overall i score Raceroom 9 out 10, it's such a joy to play.. Currently we are preparing online private and public competitions. Hopefully the missing features can only add to the experience Raceroom already has to offer.  Greetings
8688	1	a	best free game out there
8690	1	a	I'm actually a big fan of this game. Free to play with lots of content to purchase at decent prices if you buy it in packs.
8692	1	a	Excellent game with loads of content. I love driving Pechito López's Citroen in the WTCC series.
8694	1	a	Edit after a year or so. This sim just keeps getting better. The latest release with the fantastic nordschleife really puts this at the top of the racing hill. They also worked out a few bugs that were sometimes interrupting the fun - no more. What was previously a great game with issues is now starting to really get polished. There is no better sim racing experience that getting into a good online race with this game. Shell out the $20 for some paid content, join some big-boy races with respectful racers, and never look back. The pricing model works well for me because i can buy once (still cheaper than the other sim) and not worry about a subscription. Again, no other racing sim gets my adrenalin flowing like this one - it really conveys the feel of speed and competition. Single player is quite good as well especially for European racing fans, but i'm more of a multiplayer user. Again if you are a sim racer and have not tried this in the last year, do yourself a favor and try it again - then judge for yourself. Even using the free content to get a taste should convince most.   There is still the odd bug or two, but the devs pay attention and always take care of the issues that the community brings up - for instance - currently player names above the cars are located off screen for triple monitor users. I believe this is about to be fixed in the next patch (as of 6/13/16), along with taking care of those with low ping to not ruin races. Check out the forums here  https://forum.sector3studios.com/index.php   Final thoughts - at 450 hours played, i really should be faster! But i'm getting there....  Original Review: Great racing sim. There are sims that do certain things better (AC graphics for instance) but as a whole package, this is the sim that makes me feel the most like i'm in a car driving and gets my heart pounding. You just feel like you are there, which is the whole point of a sim right? The Raceroom track that comes free is great too, and i like being able to pay for what i want, even if it can get pricey if you want a ton of content. Thumbs up!
8696	1	a	The game is good fun once you get into it. Nearly everyone I've talked to who has truely taken the time to learn the physics, you'll need to adjust your wheel to you, which will take time. After which it's very enjoyable. I've had so much run racing the 1992 DTM cars, and the 2014 DTM Experience is a great singleplayer experience. the full length championships are my personal favorite.   However you cannot properly handle the cars on a Keyboard. A gamepad is an improvement, the Microsoft Speed Wheel is probably the best you can do without getting a proper wheel and pedal setup. I have tired all of these avanues prior to getting a Fanatec GT3RS wheel and CSR pedals.    If you want to get into it, look into getting either Logitech G25 or G27, Fanatac Wheel (Porsche, CSR or clubsport), or a Thrustmaster T500RS, or T300RS. IT may seem like a big jump, but if you want to really apprechiate Sim Racing, it's the only way to go.  There are only a few drawbacks I've found with R3E. First, the interface takes a bit to get use to, it's not as intuitive as it could be. Second, The time investment to dial in your controller settings, Lastly the online hoppers are pretty dead overall (although it's still in Alpha, so here's hoping it'll get better in time).
8698	1	a	I dont get why people think that this sort of game (just look at the quality of racetracks and cars) will be almost free. This game is more like a racesim constructor. u will get all u need to drive a few rounds for free. but if u want more u have to pay. its totaly legit and fair since u just pay what u want.  sure the prices are a bit high but its okay for me. i spended 26€ so far. now i got 7 additional car with 3-7 paintjobs per car. a lot of new tracks and two different race classes.  if u dont want to pay. u will get a few cars (should be 5) from different classements and u can drive a 3 courses. this courses have variants so its not getting bored so soon.  my thoughts about this game? its realy awesome. the forcefeedback feels realy good. the racetracks looking realy good (okay the race audience could be look better). the cars performing realy good.  so all in all this game is ♥♥♥♥ing great. just dont expect u will get an triple A title for zero bucks. expect a triple A title if u invest some bucks. ;)
8700	1	a	From GTR2 to Race07 to this, SimBin (Now sector 3) has produced some of the best racing sims out there. Yes this was a bit of a handfull when it was released but as its been develloped, its been refined and polished into a fantastic sim, that allows for a ton of on and offline racing fun. With added DLC (optional) you can race a ton of cars and tracks (my personal favs are the DTM and WTCC cars).   If you have played their older titles, try this one out, it may not be perfect but its still a ton of fun!
755	0	a	Still no soding multiplayer even thou they have been promising this scince launch it just never happens.  untill there is MP its a steaming turd time trials suck @ss and having to buy cars is a joke let me race my freinds.  yet another game with promises that just donot happen and its a shame cos it has the potential to be good WTF are the dev's doing.
8702	1	a	This is no Need For Speed.  If you want a casual game with a balance realism and fun buy SHIFT.  This game is a real simulator, which for a lot of people means frustration. You must own a steering wheel eg: Logitech G27 or equivalent to really immerse yourself in it. You will not have fun playing this until you get really good at it… just like playing CS online.  All aside, with lots of practice this is one of the best driving simulators I have played. I had a few friends play it and they absolutely hated it… now they all own a copy :)  Awesome GFX Great feedback Sound is incredible It’s free :) What more can i say...
8704	1	a	By far my favourite sim at the moment. Force feedback is now fixed for T300 owners and it's fantastic; engine sounds are even more incredibile than before. Plenty of cars - new and oldstyle- to drive. Highly reccommended !
8706	1	a	I played this years ago in the beta and didnt think much off it but just gave it another go and wow so much has changed ffb is great, content is very good, prices now pretty cheap, and still looks good, ignore early reviews and spend a few quid on some content and im sure you will enjoy dont be put off the multiplayer by going into the crash fest free content servers as paid content people drive well
8708	1	a	If you are a sim driver and have not tried this out, get it! Simulation drivers must have and for free like Simraceway/ 
8710	1	a	I have been playing racing sims fpr a long time and have to say that so far RaceRoom captures the feel of racing better than any other I have played. It takes a few tries to get the feel of the cars but that is because of the excellent physics engine. I really hope they move into some rally cars and tracks, but what they have so far will keep me busy for months. Another plus is being able to see the results of real world racers and see how close (or not) you are to their times. 
8712	1	a	Absolutely great game, Of course the price is steep what that is why your should only buy content when sales are going on.  But overall an absolute joy to play,   Hardcore and Casual will find something in here to have fun with.
8714	1	a	Hesitant Recomendation.  Fantastic sounds, great physics, excellent track quality, car models are really well done, graphics are nice and immersive. All makes for a very enjoyable sim racing experience.  However, this game requires an internet connection to play. Something you should always be aware if you decide to purchase content for this game. I also think the prices are a little high. I reccomend you grab stuff when it's in packs and on discount.
8716	1	a	I first played this game back in 2013, and was underwhelmed. On a whim, I decided to fire it up again last week, and I've been blown away by just how much it's changed for the better. If you are a fan of motorsport or racing games, I highly recommend this game. The pricing model is a little cumbersome at first, but if you buy a pack such as DTM 2015, you'll find yourself with a fair amount of content for a reasonable price, and you can add more packs gradually if you feel like something different. The inclusion of licensed motorsport series is a plus, and the track list features some interesting European tracks that I haven't seen in many other racing games. The car handling and sounds are outstanding, and the graphics are quite decent too. The actual racing is some of the best I've personally experienced, depending on the AI settings, races can be quite close and the game does a good job of replicating the aggressive doorhandle to doorhandle nature of touring car racing. Perhaps the neatest thing about the game is that you can try it out before commmiting to buy anything, so don't take my word for it, try it out!   I give RaceRoom Racing Experience a solid 8/10.
8718	1	a	great game love it
8720	1	a	I think the game is free for a good reason: 'See if you like it, if you dont, you're not scrwed into keeping it and forcing yourself to like it' I bought F1 2013 and handling sucks, yes yes different series...I dont care. Fake handling is fake handling. This game is much much closer to sim. I love it.  I love that it's free so I can decide if I'm going to buy the other DLC.  Please...shut your mouths.
8722	1	a	For me, this is brilliant. Keep it coming :)
8724	1	a	This is a good game with wheel support. It is fun by itself but I would recommend buying some packs to really enjoy it. Overall it is a good game, and I would definatly consider downloading it.
8726	1	a	Just make the game available offline.  You have so much to loose just because of this. Tons of people not happy about it. Tons of people that would buy it to play online but they don't because they also want to play singleplayer and enjoy those great cars and tracks and sounds that you put into this game without lag, online rookies, etc. I don't see justifing in paying for something and depending on the internet to enjoy it. Every time the internet is down...my money is gone! Please...
8728	1	a	RaceRoom is beyond everything that can be imagine in racing.. RaceRoom is not a sim, it is just THE REALITY. I SPEAK AS A MAN WHO APPLIES SKIP BARBER RACING SCHOOL KNOWLEDGES LIKE A BIBLE IN MY DAY-BY-DAY DRIVING.. THIS IS THE ONLY SIM WHERE EVERY PRINCIPLE CAN BE APPLIED AS IN THE REAL LIFE!!!( OF COURSE, IN THE SAME LEAGUE WITH THE ONLY REAL RALLY GAME, RICHARD BURNS RALLY). I M HAPPY FOR DISCOVERING YOU! NOTHING COMPARES WITH YOU, RACEROOM ! THANK YOU!
8730	1	a	itsw a cool games. have its ups and downs but i say check it out
8732	1	a	This is a great game. I have only played the free content so far as i find the puchase content a little confusing as to how much it actually costs. The Apex hunt function offers a great learning curve and the Get Real mode feels great. Excellent sound too as you would expect from Simbin.
8734	1	a	This game really does need a steering wheel / pedal set to get the best out of it. Controlling any of the cars with the keyboard is hard. A game controller might make things a bit easier, and the game does support mouse steering, but neither of these is ideal. The free to play content has some very high powered cars which make keyboard control even more difficult, which is one reason that a lot of players give up after a short time.  If you've got a wheel and pedals it's a different matter. I love it. The cars feel 'alive' - challenging and fun to drive. The AI is really solid, the sound is awesome and the graphics are nice too. A real gem - the ADAC GT Masters 2014 and DTM 2014 packs are simply brilliant and make for some seriously exciting racing against the AI.   It's good online too  Updated stuff....  Some folk are complaining about the 'free 2 play' description for RaceRoom. I agree, it's a bit odd, maybe the label's a hangover to the old SimBin days. The free content isn't a particularly good example of what the game's actually like. There's a (non-Steam) demo of the ADAC GT Masters 2014 pack available here:  http://adac-gtm-experience.com/demo/   there's also a DTM 2014 demo here:   http://www.dtm-experience.com/en/demo/   might better show the game off.   The price of the content varies a lot depending on how and when you buy it. If you take a little time figuring out what's included in each pack, it's possible to get a pile of good tracks and a car set for £12 - £15 - the DTM 2013 experience is particularly good value at the moment, even thought there's no sale on (sales come round every month or two). Once you have plenty of tracks, you can buy a single car from a car set (they're free to test) and can then use that car to race against all the other cars in that set (on or off line).  If you assume that you'll spend as much as a normal full price game (say £30) then you can get a substantial slice of the content.   The pace of development is impressive - lots of good stuff has been added recently like the WTCC 2014 car pack. And there's a big physics model overhaul in the works, along with a new ADAC GTM pack for 2015.   One final thing, if you like the game there are some cool 3rd party addons like telemetry widgets and my own Crew Chief app here:   https://forum.sector3studios.com/index.php?threads/offical-release-of-crew-chief-version-2-now-with-volume-controls-and-even-launches-r3e-for-you.2516/ 
8736	1	a	Here is what I have been thinking about RaceRoom Experience before the new update. Now it's just getting even better. My Thoughts::  http://www.tjrsim.com/lets-talk-raceroom-experience/  Want 2b Fast. Check out my FFB Setup.  http://www.tjrsim.com/how-to-be-fast-in-raceroom-experience-feel-your-race-car/ 
8738	1	a	  its a really good game just that ive found one problem on a track. at spa coming into the pit entry in the formula juniors the wall grabs the tyres and your stuck it happens everytime though
8740	1	a	This is a very good game. Some of the most realistic physics that i have ever played and i have every driving game. A lot better feeling than Assetto Corsa or Project cars. As soon as the green hell (Nordscliefe Full) is out (which is due this year) i will be driving this sim all day.  The Graphics are very easy to max out with a not very powerful PC. I have a GTX 970 and on full settings only utalise 70% MAX with full field of cars.  Best racing sim out there without a doubt at the moment.  Buy one car in each class and the track pack and its supprisingly good value also.
8742	1	a	Oh MAN! This game is AWESOME!
8744	1	a	Hi Guys,  For me personally the most important thing when playing a racing sim is a believable handling of the cars and an emotional experience. So if you´re disappointed from all the latest triple A racing titles like Project Cars and so on, you have to try RaceRoom Experience. The FFB and the sounds make the difference. The sounds of the engines and cars are simply incredibly - pure adrenaline. Let´s see you at the next multiplayer session ;-).  All the best, Robin
8746	1	a	are people slagging off this game cause its pay to play...or cause its no good....just see past the pay to play....great racing..looks good..and the sounds are the best 
8748	1	a	After giving all the popular sim titles a try, I keep coming back to R3E. The vehicle physics feel just as accurate and responsive as iracing and miles better than PCars or AC. What really sets this game apart, though, is the closeness of racing. I have never played another game where you can race inches apart from other online drivers for laps on end without lag or ghosting interfering. The p2p multiplayer system is almost flawless in my experience.
8750	1	a	With the latest iterations it is simply the best racing sim. I finally can get rid of the 8 year old GTR-Evolution to drive a decent round on the Nürburgring Nordschleife. It has the most beautifull and relastic implemtation of it i've seen so far. And the regulary updated competitions are always a nice challenge too.
8752	1	a	One of the best racing games on steam
8754	1	a	Picked this up since it was free, figured I'd give it a try. First night playing, it was ok. The graphics are good. The physics seem good while providing a challenging driving experience. Although it did take me another day to get my FFB sorted. There really is no explanation for what some of the settings do. (or a short rather canned one)  Once I got my FFB dialed in, the game/sim really started to shine. I use the Logitech G27 with pedals and H-shifter. A wheel really is the preferred way to get the best experience, though I'm sure there are a handful of controller users out there who can rip it up pretty good.  The sounds really are pretty amazing. Especially when you start to drive different cars. Considering I've got 12 hours and 128 laps under my belt in one weekend, its safe to say I'm hooked.   If the devs can continue in the right direction with development, R3E has a lot of potential to be great! And don't be turned off by paid content until you at least try the free stuff. Other racing sim organizations (not mentioning any names) do the same thing.  =====Update 02/13/2015======  After 1100+ laps and over 2 days of total in game time I can say I'm still hooked. The most recent update Feb 2015 improved the AI and optimized the graphics. Dedicated servers are coming soon. I believe this year which will open up online racing leagues.  I own almost all the cars. All tracks and all packs but the hill climb. Yes a little pricey, but worth it IMO. The devs stay in constant contact with the community which is more than I can say for other games/sims. New tracks and cars are still in the works, the most recent upcoming new track, Sonoma and the Cadillac CTS VR coupe to be released soon as paid content. R3E has only gotten better since I've been playing it and it was pretty good when I started with it anyway.   R3E is definitely to be taken seriously among other race sims currently on the market.
8756	1	a	I like this game and its sounds, the fact that you have to buy cars and stuff doesn't bother me, mainly because I had to do it for iRacing and the cost of one car on there can buy you about 4 or more cars on this game, depending if there is a sale or not. I agree with empty box that the sounds are fantastic. In my opinion I think it is a good game for me to play singleplayer races because I am in to that although i wish there was an aggressiveness slider so I don't get dive bombed constantly or run over in the corners, but that is just me.
8758	1	a	Really, this is an amazing game. I would have bought it for a lot of money, amazed that it's freeeeee!
8760	1	a	This game, along with 2 mods, are now stuck in my library forever because my friends told me to download them. I am ashamed that they appear on my account and a tear falls from my eye everytime I see it.  Thank you Saif.
8762	1	a	Very good sim nice mix of gaming and sim racing, great physix very fun for gamer and racer alike.
8764	1	a	Great game just needs to have AL drivers added to servers and admin servers to change settings for game im sure the players would pay for it if needed i would and my friends 
8766	1	a	No other racing simulator has the sounds dead on like this one.
8768	1	a	Good casual racing game, not serious but you can alter certain setups on the car. Easy to just find a quick server and race in a few minutes of starting the game. Mechanics and graphics are good, also allows for pad or wheel. Obviously a free game would be riddled with DLC but you can still have lots of fun free or maybe 1 or 2 DLC. As far as free games go, this is my fave.
8770	1	a	This game is rated criminally low on Steam, I guess because people want everything for free. Kinda ridiculous. I agree some of the content is too pricey, but for a reasonable price you can grab two or three packs of cars/tracks and have a ton of fun.  The opponent AI and the sound are the best currently available. Handling/physics is great, maybe just a notch behind AC, and the polish of the UI and menus is simple but well done and doesn't feel like a beta like so many sims do these days. No better game out right now if you want to simulate a touring car race season.  If you're a sim racing fan, you should absolutely give this a try and see if you want to buy some additional content. It's one of the top few sims available!
8772	1	a	I've gotta be honest, I played this game a long long time ago when it first came out. basically, and it was god awful.   However, this game has become one of the best sims out there. Anyone who thinks differently hasn't gotten off iRacing long enough.   The tire fall off is almost nearly perfect, the steering and force-feed-back is glorious... The graphics, don't even get me started!   The cut track system is a little nazi-ish and hopefully that changes just a little. That's really my only complaint.   Awesome game. Give it a try.
8774	1	a	I fully recommend this game for any racing enthusiast. It was the game that made me fall in love with my Logitech G27.
8776	1	a	the most polished and complete product in the genre out there!!  FFb and physics could be improved for more authenticity imo.  UPDATE JAN 2016: The new physics/ffb of the new audisTT/DTM15/FR2/ACQUILA have improved this sim no end.    Does need more race features than content at the moments, but immersion behind the wheel is the best out there!  Can it compete with the best? I think its almost there!
8778	1	a	Very fun and realistic game! 10/10
8780	1	a	Better than AC
8782	1	a	best racingsim ive tryed this game have old solid roots (gtr / race 07) simbin series though you need a controller  and you should aim for a quality wheel but an xbox one controller will do just fine to start with   though you will always (when you get a new wheel or controller) need to to spend some time fidling with sentivity etc   there is some post here and there about how to config the controller and dont expect the controller fidling like a Playstation game where you just plug and play (it took me some hours to find the right setup for me controller )  pretty good graphics though some say it aint that good but hey either they play on a potato or demanding triple A 2016 graphics of a 3-4 year old game oreven older   lots of cool cars some is free most of them cost money though but i find the carpacks worth it im guessing its how you look at it   lots of cool real life tracks   championship races where you can win ingame money to purchase cars and tracks and ofcause   play against other racers either by time trial (ingame money prizes) or in a race with 24+ people on the actual track  quite a few dlc's but again which game nowadays dont got dlc's   and if you want extra content in form of dlc's THEN DONT BUY THEM THROUGH STEAM they cost like 3-4 times more the the ingame store i purchased dtm 2015 through the ingame store to less then 10 euro compared to steam price tag at 25 euro
8784	1	a	This game is great... I love it! Psysics are gr9 m9! I Absolutely love it! Play fro yourself to believe it!
8786	1	a	Amazing racing simulation ever, realistic physics and models.
8788	1	a	Amazing racing simulation ever, realistic physics and models.
8790	1	a	What i like with this game is: Graphic is good It is very good optimized for both racing wheels and gamepad.  The driving could be better. I mean some cars are like really good to drive while others feels like they have not added any feedback to make them different.  Note: U only get 3 cars in the free to play version and 3 tracks to race them on, this is not bad idea but i don't like that u need to pay for almost every car in game. i would like to have all cars stock or that u could buy a package to get every car in game for a reasonable prize.
8792	1	a	Downloaded this game because the videos and screenshots looked amazing, but it is far from being finished. The graphics are really nice, the gameplay is simple but and it is a big but. The menu system they've tried to do is a little complicated.. Also being a free member ONLY, you get only... 4 cars max and only 3 tracks man. In order to get the other cars, which you can see from the video above you must pay real money for, there is no mutlplayer to date, it is greyed out for now. So they should be releasing it. No multyplayer yet leaves singleplayer only, during there... You are the only racer, you get a ghost car but only 1, no other cars. Boring! The cars you get I think is 4 max but I only noticed 2, the super car you get and a BMW.. Now the handling... It does not matter what mode you select from the 2, amatuer or sim they both drive exactly the same, I tried them both out and both of them handled the exact same no difference to it, you can edit the car setup which is alright but the cars STILL feel the same. I tried to get along with this game, but the massive downfall of you having to buy the other cars and extremely limiting gameplay is a massive no no. I maybe redownload this game in the future for a little mess around with friends, WHEN they release the multiplayer but for now, it is just not ready.
8794	1	a	its seems complicated at first and i had to change the controlles to fit me witch i would recommend that you check the controlles becouse there is no tutorial and so much dlc and only 3 tracks free with the game and there is hardly an online gameplay becouse most of the times the servers are empty but other then that i love playing this game and just dicking around trying to drift and ♥♥♥♥
8796	1	a	Massively underrated racing sim. One of the best sims unfortunately hamstrung by in app purchases. Not that expensive if you are careful what you buy but not cheap either.
8798	1	a	This game is great... I love it! Psysics are gr9 m9! I Absolutely love it! Play fro yourself to believe it!
8800	1	a	best racingsim ive tryed this game have old solid roots (gtr / race 07) simbin series though you need a controller  and you should aim for a quality wheel but an xbox one controller will do just fine to start with   though you will always (when you get a new wheel or controller) need to to spend some time fidling with sentivity etc   there is some post here and there about how to config the controller and dont expect the controller fidling like a Playstation game where you just plug and play (it took me some hours to find the right setup for me controller )  pretty good graphics though some say it aint that good but hey either they play on a potato or demanding triple A 2016 graphics of a 3-4 year old game oreven older   lots of cool cars some is free most of them cost money though but i find the carpacks worth it im guessing its how you look at it   lots of cool real life tracks   championship races where you can win ingame money to purchase cars and tracks and ofcause   play against other racers either by time trial (ingame money prizes) or in a race with 24+ people on the actual track  quite a few dlc's but again which game nowadays dont got dlc's   and if you want extra content in form of dlc's THEN DONT BUY THEM THROUGH STEAM they cost like 3-4 times more the the ingame store i purchased dtm 2015 through the ingame store to less then 10 euro compared to steam price tag at 25 euro
8802	1	a	Great Simulator. All cars are a joy to drive and the tracks are awsome aswell.  The sounds are better than all racegames/racesimulators i played so far. You can feel the road and the cars behaviour trough the force feedback better. So you can catch slides and even drift if you want too.  Another thing that realy upped this game is the ability to make championships off your own this realy helped me back behind the wheel of this game.  You get a couple of cars to start with for free and a couple of tracks. So you can experience the way it drives and you dont necessarily have to buy stuff.  When you tried this game and you like driving/racing you will probably buy content though ;).
8804	1	a	most fun ive ever had, so buy it( not really buy it, but you know what i mean :) so i recomend this game just for the graphics 
8806	1	a	 What is Raceroom?
8808	1	a	alot of people ♥♥♥♥ on this game but i really liike it for my first sim 4 stars 
8810	1	a	This sim is one of my favorites.  Since Sector 3 Studios was born, RaceRoom has received new force feedback, which is acclaimed to be amongst the best. New content has received new physics for cars and new more detailed track surfaces. Also, they are going through all of the old content and updating the cars to the new physics model. Most tracks have now been updated aswell, however they may have finished by the time you read this.  Combine these 3 things with genre leading sounds and you have one of the best experiences available in sim racing today.  Multiplayer has a unique style of netcode where your ping to each other racer seems to be p2p rather than via the server you are racing on, which is great. Racing standards in most lobbies I have been in is of a good standard.  Along side the DLC listed in steam, RaceRoom also has a store in game.  The price for cars and tracks beyond the given free ones are very reasonable compared to other sims that charge on a per car/track basis, this also enables the devs to keep adding new content consistently. Content is now available in packs for a discount as well. The neat thing is the way you get a scaling discount based upon how much of said pack you already own. Because I had already bought the DTM packs (DTM 2013 I picked up for a nice $7.50 on sale through steam dlc) and ADAC 2013 pack, when I went to buy the European track pack the remaining 3 or 4 tracks I didn't already own ended up costing me about 20% of what they would have if I bought them individually.  One really big thing for me being an Aussie is BATHURST!  It's probably the best most accurate version of the track ever made outside of laser scanning.  Yep, if you like racing cars with a wheel or even a gamepad, definitely make sure you check this one out.
8812	1	a	very good Racing Game 9/10
8814	1	a	pretty realistic... no upgrade or buying cars(except for real money or vrp) Multiplayer is fun but not enough people playing it seems. need to buy tracks to play most multiplayer sessions. still its a kick in the pants if you enjoy racing and are competitive in nature
8816	1	a	Game looks great but personally I could not get it working with my Logitech GeForce Pro steering wheel. I was like a drunk driver, all over the track. Frame drops and other issus on start of race didn't help.  Force Feedback: TOO MANY CONTROLLS on wheel settings plus these settings get changed for every car, So you have to go through the process all over again (most likely) if you change cars. The default steering was WAY to sensitive so I decreased and then the car felt sluggish and it felt like controller lag.   I never felt like I was racing :-( I also found it impossible to drift due to the problems described with the wheel response and force feedback settings. Maye it's the wheel as I see other people mention the Logitech setups are an issue. I just don't want to spend hrs setting up a wheel for each car I want to use.  The grass / track edges seem suck you in. Is that considered realism? I know many games will punish for cutting corners and it should be slippy on the throttle, but should you get sucked into the barrier?
8818	1	a	Good gameplay, great sound, nice graphics. But there's one thing: too many microtransactions
8820	1	a	This is a Fantastic racing simulator. Very good graphics and over all game play. Be warned for those looking for an arcade like racing game because this is not the game for you then. This is not a bump people out of the way or wreck your way to a win type of racing game. This is a racing simulator and a very good one. The one drawback is that it can be expensive becuase you must buy more cars and tracks as time goes on to really enjoy this game. I bought a pack that was $24.00 usd and recieved 22 new cars and 9 new tracks so that should keep me busy for quite sometime. You do however get a few free cars and tracks to play and this will help you decide if the game is worth investing in long term. I promise you will be happy if you do and over all its still way cheaper then most other racing simulators out there. This game is fully controller, steering wheel or keyboard and mouse compatible. I am currently using an xbox 360 controller and a ps4 controller (ya i know lol) and they work flawlessly. There is nothing bettter then Pc racing simulators and this is a good one.
8822	1	a	Great to play
8824	1	a	I tried the game when launched 2 years ago and sure it has been seriously enhanced and optimized. Outstanding sensations, Sound environnement, realism and Force Feedback feeling. Playing on a 3 screens setup (5760*1080 / R9-290X / i7 4930k) with G25 (DIY piston brake mod) Stable game, no bugs so far, but FrameRate could be better or maybe i miss something in options.   Unfortunately the game has serious lacks like tire choice, temperature, setups saving, ...  So i don't know if i recommend or not. As a realism-addict-gamer i would say YES YES YES : the sensations you get when you manage to drive a fast car in this simulator are just ♥♥♥♥♥♥ic. As a customer i would say NO : i'm seriously disappointed about many obvious lacks in the simulation, keeping in mind the money you need to spend to own decent car and tracks choices to practice and challenge.   But i could say same thing about our IRL cars: webcams, USB, SDcard etc are cheap and already old stuff from around 2000... so why aren't they supplied by default on every car in the market by then ?  Why do we still have to pay hundreds of euros to get that options on a 10-20.000 euros product ?   By the way you can drive some car and tracks FOR FREE INFINITELY !!  So no surprise if you buy it.  I just played 20h and i would already say it did worth the euros :)
8826	1	a	Fantastic game. Only downside is that you can't edit the liveries/skins on the car like you can in Iracing etc...
8828	1	a	I've played PC, AC, and RF2, and I always come back to RaceRoom. Hands down the best racing sim available. The interface is very well done. The tuning options in the game actually do something and make sense. The cars behave and handle like real cars. Ultimately this is the classic you get what you pay for, RaceRoom is more expensive, but it really is very well done and worth the investment if you are really into racing simulation games.
8830	1	a	As a big fan of Race 07 I was keen to get this game, and when I found it was free I was even happier. When I finally played it, my overall verdict was that there needs to be some game optimization. I can run GRID Autosport on Max but with this game my PC was struggling even at the low end. This is a very graphics heavy game and you need to know your PC can handle it before you start investing. Other than that I love this series for it's car models and the accuracy. Not many other games include disciplines such as DTM and WTCC and as my favorites I couldn't be more pleased. If the game could be optimized then this would be one of my top racing simulation games.
8832	1	a	Blows your socks off. Feels, looks and sounds so real, it's the raw simulation racing I've craved since F355 on the Dreamcast.   Online racing is still beta but it works OK for the most part and is very thrilling. I haven't paid for anything yet and have found no problem in finding hours worth of entertainment in it.  I do plan on buying some cars and tracks at some point but the whole vRP virtual money system is pretty convoluted and confusing, so it's put me off as it's difficult to weigh up the price of things.
8834	1	a	cool that's it
8836	1	a	Very fun and challenging game, Nice Graphics even for low. A very fun Racing game.  Edit: Logging in does sometimes give an error.

8840	1	a	Amazing sound, great FFB, physics is good I guess, Everything else is boring as ♥♥♥♥ as in every other sim. Missing so many cars, graphics is meh and cockpits are by far the worst Ive ever seen. But the sound is just sooooo ♥♥♥♥in good.
8842	1	a	Now i have my Xbox ONE controller st up correctly its fun. VERY mis-leading saying free to play. Very little content and you have to PAY for everything. Youll need a decentish PC to run well. Sounds are some of the best on any racing game, GFX are a little last gen but still demanding enough to push a decent last gen GFX card :) Can i recomend it? Not sure really. pi55 poor content says no. But you dont get something for nothing - which we seem to forget these days! Might buy a pack of cars and tracks and give a different opinion. I would have liked a semi/full demo to get a feel before buying anything really
8844	1	a	Free to Play Racing Sim where you pay for what you want. For some reason this is enough to give the game a negative review. Not me.  This game has the best sounding cars I have ever heard in a video game. Period. Nothing else even comes close. It also has outstanding forcefeedback, a big community, and accurate simulation. The AI is pretty good, it's very agressive though. It seems to be a bit dynamic.  I can't get enough of it. There's also a lot of real racing drivers that play this game which is pretty cool. It was, and wasn't, surprising to see Mike Rockenfeller at the top of the leaderboards for a few tracks.  If you like motorsport and have a racing wheel this is a must play. It's FREE, there's a few tracks you can try and you can test drive every car in the game for free, along with a handful you get for free. It's worth your time and if you don't like it there's no loss. You don't have to pay a cent.
8846	1	a	great racing and content, sounds are excellent the graphics aren't bad, the physics are OK. All in all, lot's of good things, no bad things which make a great game. Worth downloading I mean it's free. Only problem is that you have to pay for more cars than 3 or 4 and more tracks than 2. The basic content is enough for me though so it's enough for anyone.
759	0	a	Really fantastic game, sadly ruined by the cost of micro transactions. Sector 3 please just ditch the current payment model and sell the complete game for £29.99 and you will have a real winner with this game.
8848	1	a	Don't listen to these other tight wads. For just a little over $50 USD, you can get 17 cars + 5 free cars. 12 tracks + 2 free tracks. That is when there is a 50% off sale. So watch for a sale, spend your money wisely and have lots and lots of fun. Multi-player is on the horizon for this game as well. Get in now while the gettin' is good, otherwise pay full price for it when the game is finally released. The game looks good, feels good and sounds good. What's not to like about it.
8850	1	a	the graphics are decent but thats what i would expect from a free computor game, And steering is a bit off. But online is great i really like this game it is lots of fun, super addicting!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
8852	1	a	Overall, I like this game. I, to be honest, expected something along the lines of Forza or Grand Torismo standards, but in my eyes, it met a fraction of those standards. I have to admit though, this is a very nice and sharp looking game when it's on it's highest settings (it set mine to the highest setting because my computer is very powerful). I am very fond of how many cars there are in the game and I love how each and every one of them has their own different sound. Although i'm not a car expert, if fact I don't really know much about cars in the first place....but I still wanted to try this game as I have heard it looked amazing and was a very good free to play game. They were right. Although this game has a lot of good stuff about it, I feel it has quite a lot of negative stuff about it. To start off, I noticed how there was a MAJOR lack of music unlike Forza or Grand Torismo or most racing games combined. This really annoys me because I feel that the music can bring a certain video game to life (ex: Saints Row 3, I actually got hooked on it because I started listening to it's soundtrack and just fell in love). I also didn't like how a good 75% of controls are unbinded at default, which I don't know if that's because the developers just wanted to let the player bind them his/herself or because they were just too lazy. Another problem is with every single car. What I noticed is how they all fail to break especially on very hard turns. I always find myself in 5-6th gear and then a very hard turn comes and I slow down, but I slow down enough that i'm still in 3rd-4th gear which doesn't help with the turn (I stop nearly 2 seconds before the actual turn). This is also a problem because I don't know if I properly binded a key; handbrake. I binded it to space (it shows I binded it correctly in the settings, but i'm just not sure) and when I press space while the car is just rolling, nothing happens. If I use it when i'm turning, slight to nothing really happens. In most case senarios I feel it does virtually nothing, when compared to other racing games where the handbrake is vital to the game. Handbrake wasn't even pre-binded when I started the game. Set aside all the negative stuff about the game, I would like to focus on the positive stuff in the game. What I think I enjoy the most about this is how it's actually more of a formula one racing game as you don't see day-to-day cars in the game like Forza. I personally love the formula one cars because they always give me a sence of how it would really feel if I was in one. With a computer so heavily powered and with a game that looks so amazing as this one does, they make up well to fulfill what I like most about formula one cars. I also like how there are LOTS of cars and tracks to choose from (there aren't many default and free tracks and cars, but there are a TON of paid tracks and cars). Although I don't have a lot of time under my belt playing the game, I can see it will turn out to be a very well made game. 7.9/10
8854	1	a	THIS GAME IS FINALLY DRIVEABLE WITH THE LATEST UPDATE AND NOW MULTIPLAYER IS HERE ITS NOT CHEAP TO BUY ALL THE CONTENT BUT ITS WORTH IT. THE DRIVING PHYSICS ARE GOOD ITS A LITTLE EASIER TO DRIVE THAN ASSETO CORSSA. THE GRAPHICS ARE GOOD AND SMOOTH MULTIPLAYER RACING WITHOUT HAVING TO BUY A MILLION DOLLAR GRAPHICS CARD.
8856	1	a	THIS GAME IS AMAZING AND FREE. Although limited on cars and tracks this game is a good sim with amazing physics.
8858	1	a	This is one of my favourites games on PC at the moment. Its still in beta but I've bought ALL the content which says a lot for the quality. I have a G27 and the depth of immersion when racing is fantastic. I've played a lot of PC sIms over the years and this ranks highly in my opinion. If your on the hunt for a new racing sim you cant go wrong here. I think the goods news is the guys over at Sector3 formerly Simbin are evolving this title all the time and it will only get better.
8860	1	a	8.9 hours review! lets go: PROS: Great Sounds Great Physics Good Graphics Supports Mouse Users That Don't Have A Wheel/Controller For The PC You Can Play It Without Buying Any Cars/Tracks  CONS: Verry Expensive If You Buy Cars/Tracks The Multiplayer Is Still In Alpha Pretty Bad AI (Something Like Project Cars Has) Does Not Support Controllers ATM (at the moment)   give this game a try if you like sim racers  Rating: 6.8/10
8862	1	a	Where to start?  I'm a huge DTM fan, and this game was the only one on the market that actually let me have the experience to drive with Muller, Felix da Costa, Green and all the others.  But it does more than that. It's an actual simulator, which makes everything WAY more interesting.  The tracks are spot on, so are the cars. This is THE racing game I always wanted, and now here it is.  Graphics are great, gameplay damn close to the real thing, and nothing else to add.  10/10 would 49.900 Norisring again with the DTM merc.
8864	1	a	Know what you're getting into.  It's obvious a lot of effort went into this game; the realism is fantastic. However, be warned that with a high level of realism in the physics and handling comes a higher difficulty, or at least a much steeper learning curve. The game is probably much better when played on a wheel, but with a standard controller you're probably gonna have a frustrating time. I know I did.   If you live and breathe racing sims and don't mind taking the time to learn how to control the monstrously powerful cars in this game, go for it. If you're looking for a relaxing blast through the tracks with a more arcade-y feel, this definitely isn't the game for you.   Track and car selection is limited without paying, and it would be nice if all of the free cars were grouped in one list so you didn't have to search around, but pay-to-play stuff like this comes with the territory with free games.   tl;dr: This game treats racing as SRS BUSINESS, be prepared.
8866	1	a	After reading some bad comments, sure it can get expensive. But i've yet to spend a dime and the quality of physics detail seem good. The F F B is great compared to assetto corsa. no drifting at raceroom obviously, but a good race sim. Not sure what understeer I've hear someone say on youtube. Been fine for me. Haven't raced with and assists so can't comment about that. Wish full multiplayer without buying into a race season was an option. but eh the devs did a polished job. The ui isn't perfect but has really come a long way. UI was buggy but much better now
8868	1	a	This game is quite good, but can be very limited unless you use your steam credit. The UI can be hard to understand, but apart from these complaints, it is an enjoyable game. 4/5.
8870	1	a	Great Game. I really recommend this game
8872	1	a	This is a great sim with lots of potential but will not get a lot of followers in its present state due to it having no multiplayer function. Although it's classed as a free to play game it really isn't. You get a couple of cars and the odd track for free but for anything else you're going to have to dig deep. You are expected to purchase VP points for real cash and then exchange your VP points to purchase cars and tracks. This can empty your pockets to the tune of hundreds of £.   On top of this they have other 'purchase to play' addons called 'Experiences'. At present there is the 'DTM Experience' which bolts on to the RRE menus but runs a full DTM 2013 season against AI.....again, with no Multiplayer. This comes at the cost of a full game and is basically what seasoned sim racer would call a mod of RRE. The next 'Experience' to come along will be the British or World Touring Car Championship in which you will be expected to shell out another 20-30 £ or Euros for.   While this is all going on you cannot use the tracks from DTM experience is the standard game of RRE. No no no, you have to buy the tracks  again  even though they already exist in the DTM Experience.   Even though this is a fairly decent sim it looks like Simbin will contnue to milk you for every penny they can and I for one will turn to better (And much cheaper) simulators like Assetto Corsa and rFactor 2 as they have an active modding community which provide free content as well as being able to share tracks can be between mods etc.  A great game spoilt by a rabid thirst for your money.
8874	1	a	Love the simulation and sounds!
8876	1	a	Racer check this out. The best racing sim at the moment!   Such an immersion gives you none! Sound, gfx and speeeed :D This is really an experience!  For some months i have turned my back and was in iRacing and Loeb Rally. Now after the last patch - 31/3/2016 - my racer heart is pumping stronger :D Nordschleife is out!  The new Nordschleife is a beauty and huuugggeee fun to race online with enough racers! - (btw I prefer online racing).  R3E gives you an amount of content, AI-racing is becoming better and better and you have the mp-part - which lacks of some features so far. With the AI you can race after the patch on SPA and Nordschleife with up to 100 racer grid. Starting from the back and fighting to the leader is fun sometimes for me. Lets hope for a bright online future ;D The multiplayer needs more online racer and more polish by the devs.  The controls are superb for me: In use is here a G27 with a Th8RS shifter and from time to time i like to race in the right sofa-mood with my xbox-controller in 'Sound'-view ;D   Try the free part and there is the possibility to try all cars on one track. Check it out! Absolute worth it!  For more infos visit the devs-forum:   https://forum.sector3studios.com/index.php?find-new/1901361/posts   Have fun!  Harryo  PS: Leave the FOV on 1.0 - real FOV cockpit view - and change the seat-position to your liking. You will have the best feeling so far your screen is big enough ;D   PPS: Just now the devs have released the Audi R18 :D i have to go! Cya on the track and drive with respect online!  Edit: 08/2016  Do you prefer online racing? Check Iracing: way better online system, bigger community and more more social racer.   R3E is for me now in between. Back to iracing for more multiplayer fun.
8878	1	a	Nice little game worth playing. Game physics could be worked on but racing rules are good.
8880	1	a	I'm conflicted over RRE - overall I've had a lot of fun so I give it's a 'recommended' but it's a mixed bag.  Good points Most of the cars are beautifully modelled, looking and (importantly) sounding great. Handling is mostly top-notch  Tracks are well modelled (tho Bathurst lacks the bumps it has in reality and Brands is Indy only)  Bad Points The AI isn't the best - it's not keen to overtake, seems to have MUCH better brakes/grip and hitting/being hit by an AI car tends to result in it carrying-on and you being thrown into the scenery. The pricing model means the odds are your mates won't have the cars/tracks you do which limits online fun a bit  I don't really mind the 'free game - pay for cars and tracks' model overall - it encourages them to keep developing the game by keeping the money coming in.  Tips: Cars are cheaper on their own rather that in packs UNLESS you want all the LIVERIES (which make-up most of the cost) Just because you don't own a car/livery doesn't mean the AI/other players can't use it in races (you won't be racing all-the-same cars even if you only own 1 car/livery in a class) Adaptive AI doesn't really work (for me at least) - just dial-in your level and you'll have more fun Test-drive any car you like from the Store (one track only but you'll get the idea) Steam Sales offer cheap DLC packs!!
8882	1	a	Great game.   I've played Forza, GT...love GT6, but damn! Raceroom is fun. I bought the WTCC addon (but I love WTCC) and it's a blast to drive. The FWD physics is awesome...awesome = realistic durining corning and hard braking. Then I bought the GT3 addon (everything was bought during Xmas sales) and it was a blast, I still need traction control but perfection comes with time (plus i'm using the xbox controller). Buying some of the tracks is a bit lame, to be honest but that's how this developer pays their employees.   I use a 8 core AMD , 32 gbs o' ram with 2 gtx 760's...more than enough for this game. It runs AMAZING.   If you love racing give this a shot and get the some of the addons while their still on xmas discount.
8884	1	a	EDIT: Here's my video review of R3E after playing for a month:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91oxmTnvR1k   First, I'll address the nay-sayers problems with the 'pay wall': Go to the RaceRoom Shop (not the DLC Store) and purchase your vRP credits there. With $65 you can get 10000 vRP which is *much* cheaper than buying it in-game or using Steam Wallet and you'll be able to buy pretty much all the content in the DLC store. Next, wait for things that you want to go on sale. Test drive the cars that you want to buy in-game first to make sure you like them. Please note: you *do not* have to own all cars in a class to race against a full field. If you only like the Corvette Z06, then just buy the one or two liveries that you like and when you race against AI, you'll still see McLarens and Mercedes-Benzs out on track. I picked up the ADAC GT 2014, WTCC 2015, American Track Pack, and Audi Sport TT Cup 2015 (one livery) for $27. That's *very* reasonable for a dozen tracks and a dozen cars and a few dozen liveries.  Last note on the DLC: *do not* purchase the DLC through Steam as the discounts don't apply there.  Now, as far as the driving, the FFB is detailed and informative with many settings to adjust how much each effect is weighted in the steering. You can also define clutch bite point, clutch and brake sensitivity, dead zone, upper and lower limits, as well as tune the shifter debounce timeout - and many more options. The graphics are good and the sounds are great - you can tune how much suspension squeak, tire scrub, transmission whine, etc. The AI are generally pretty good and make for a lot of fun in tighter races. I haven't tried out the online functionality.  Aside from the Portimao circuit and Lakeview Hill Climb stage, all of the free content is pretty boring and doesn't do a great job of selling the sim's potential. The Audi Sport TT Cup 2015 car is what really sold me on the sim and with its push-to-pass 10-second boost system it makes for awesome racing.  The main downside to this sim is that it *requires* a 100% always-on internet connection to the Sector 3 servers, even for single player practice. If your internet goes down for a moment or you lose connection for an instant, you're immediately booted out of the game until your connection is satisfactory again. As of this time, there is no offline mode and even slight flutters in internet connection will cause issues. It appears to have something to do with the anti-cheat mechanism they use (there are regular tournaments with leaderboards and prizes, etc) as well as the content management system to make sure you're only using DLC that you own, coupled with the online stats profiling (it logs how many laps you've done in each car at each track, how long you've spent off-track, etc) and the online telemetry upload for replays and such. It's annoying if you don't have a stable internet connection, so keep that in mind.  The sim is quite good with lots of good quality content and highly polished FFB and sound effects. I'm playing with a TrackIR 5, Logitech G25, Renovatio SRD-9c dash, on Windows 10 Pro 64-bit (Core i7-6700, 16 GB DDR4, 512 GB M.2 SSD, GTX 970) on a 34' ultrawide (21:9) display at 3440x1440.
8886	1	a	RaceRoom is developed by the minds behind simbin and I have too say it is a brilliant racing sim. I have a few nags but overall if you are in to cars, racing or just sims then check it out.  Pros: - Brilliant Graphics - Amazing Physics &amp; mechanics - Great Sounds - Good with friends  Issues: - Heavy on Systems - Very basic without pay2play vision in mind  7/10
8888	1	a	Enjoying this very much.  Tried this a while ago and went back to AC and PCars. Those two lost it some where in my opinion. Tried Raceroom again in November and my gosh what an improvement.  This is now my goto Simulator. FFB in my opinion is on par with the best and the sound....nothing else comes close.   Free content is limited but the ADAC GT3 and DTM packs are of high quality and worth every cent.
8890	1	a	the graphic is very good ,especially when in the circuit
8892	1	a	The graphics are pretty good. I tried to set my controller up to the game and it decided to not let me drive. I ended up having to set all of the controls back up again but other then that Its a great game if you enjoy racing.
8894	1	a	WOW THIS GAME IS AMAGING GRAFICS ARE SO SO GOOD DOWNLOND THIS YOU WILL LOVE IT
8896	1	a	once again unable to login anymore ,shame as this is a good game
8898	1	a	Absolutely f***** fantastic!!!!  If you want to race real racing cars and not mess about thrashing road cars then this is for you! As for all the negative feedback, yes! it is getting expensive as ive spent around £30 quid on this sim so far, however! What the negative feedback fails to mention is this, YOU CAN TEST DRIVE ANY CAR FOR FREE!!!  You do only get a few tracks to start with, but now you seem to get a whole load more cars for free, trust me its worth spending some time with this sim just for the sound and the free test driving..... hop in the Ford Capri Race Car, I spent and hour test driving it simply for the insane noise it makes, id short shift most of the time and then treat myself to the odd high rev just to hear the engine, it actually gave me goose bumps!  So then the physics.......... all I need to say here is that actual real racing drivers use this as training, TIMO GLOCK is one name that springs to mind, his profile in game reveals over 4 days of gameplay haha. Yes its a hard game to master and I'm a long way off, if I'm lucky I can get in the top 30% on a leaderboard and ive been playing these games/sims for over 15 years.  Graphics are not the greatest but you get the feeling more of the processing power is being used on the physics engine than on processing eye candy. Real sense of rubber and tarmac like you used to get with RACE07.  And the sound..... once again its worth throwing a few quid at this title just for the sound. Its sexy.
8900	1	a	I've owned Raceroom for a couple of years now. Originally, I was put off with the lack of cars and tracks, and the price of the DLC but I've bought it when on a steam sale.  I own rFactor 2, Project Cars, Stock Car Extreme and Assetto Corsa and this game feels as good to drive as any of the others. Maybe not quite as good, physics wise, as rFactor 2 or Assetto Corsa, but it looks wonderful, as nice as Project Cars. I feel that this Racing Sim is a little underrated and doesn't get the credit it deserves.  Plus points:  Runs at well over 100 ( nearer 200 ) fps on my system! ( i5 4670k, 16gb ram, Nvidia Geforce 970 gtx, Acer 144mhz monitor. ) Wonderful force feedback with my Logitech G27 wheel. Looks lovely, tracks, sky, cars, reflections, very nice indeed. Great leaderboard challenge mode. If you alter car settings you can feel the difference. Online races can be very good, with less 'console racers' than on Project Cars. Idiot drivers are turned into ghosts automatically by the game, so they don't ruin everyone elses race!  Minus points.  DLC can be expensive. Game is threadbare unless you're willing to purchase some DLC. Online games are hard to find without DLC. Plenty of online servers are empty.  Overall, this game is great fun. I would recommend downloading the barebones version to start with, if you enjoy the couple of free cars and tracks then it's well worth considering buying some DLC.  8/10
8902	1	a	I have 68h of playing and it is alwasy a chellange (for me) and it easy to race hillclimb races and copare agenst pro:s and freinds. they have add myltiplayer and it start to look good  one down is- it is a limetedmaps and cars you can play with if you don't by them  I realy recumend this game for ppl who whanna play a drive sim but havent spend alot of thim in others racingsim
8904	1	a	one of the best racing sims ive ever played, a few minor bugs here and there but i definitly recommend this to racing gamers. a long download time but its worth ever minuite.
8906	1	a	Works really well on triple monitor setup at 10K. The telemetry to Accurforce and SimXperience motion rig is really good. This is a top notch simulator. Peope who complain about driving witha keyboard, this game is not for you. The sounds are simply amazing.
8908	1	a	Great game, but its too expensive to fully enjoy the game.
8910	1	a	there's a great game here plays just like the old gtr games, unfortunately it cost's just that bit too much to actually buy it. Especially as alot of the packs overlap content which means you either virtually pay for some stuff twice or buy it all seperately for a bigger price overall. such a shame.
8912	1	a	fantastic - this game offers a full-blown simulation game for free ( yes ok the free content is not very much ), it has a very nice feel to the game when driving the cars over bupms and curbs, the way the cars can suddenly bite you in the ♥♥♥ when going around a corner is great fun - i cant say how real it is because ive never drove the road version of the cars let alone the racing counterparts! But it feel real to me, also the car sounds are amazing. My favorite of the cars is the classic touring cars. the other great thing is that you really can run this on a low end system because not only is there 15,000 quality settings to adust you can also set the amount of AI cars visible at once - i run at high to medium settings ( with expection to shadows which are off and refection quality, they kill my machine ) with 18 cars visible with a 750ti gpu and a AMD a6 duel core 4.4ghz cpu AND IT LOOKS AMAZING!!! the only bad thing is that most dlc can only be bought with the in game store ( uses your steam wallet ) and the prices are a bit steep if there not on offer.
8914	1	a	Its free so don't complain, its decent but not sure about purchasing and DLC Project Cars is more for the DLC
8916	1	a	good game and it's in multiplayer :3
8918	1	a	about time they got it on multiplayer
8920	1	a	This game is one of my favorite free racing games out there considering you cant really find that many good free racing games
8922	1	a	Best sound of any racing sim period. It's more like free2try than free2play. You should give it a try!
8924	1	a	Shound is awesome! But you wheelslip to easy tho...
8926	1	a	Seems a bit expensive at first. Unless you compare it to iracing. Much better priced than iracing and their GFX engine kicks its ♥♥♥. So far loving it.
8928	1	a	Since end of last year the guys at sector3 have turned RRE into a sim that can compete in the current market, the physics are good enough, ffb, sounds, graphics, ai and track/car selection are great, the content packs come at reasonable prices and the sim is very frequently updated with new features and quality content, if you like racing games/sims RRE is definitely worth your time and money.
8930	1	a	I got this on steam when it was still a baby. It has now grown into a giant. You can tweak this game to your heart’s desire. What a brilliant simulator it has become. I always favored rFactor2 but I must say Raceroom has now taken the lead. This really is the best racing sim you can buy. Project cars feels like a console game and AC like a boat simulator. Keep up the good work Sector 3!!!!
8932	1	a	hi vary good game love it the only problum is that it keeps crashing on me auther than that a good game
8934	1	a	Yes, but its pay to play kind of game.
8936	1	a	Can i yse my Genius Racing wheel on it?
8938	1	a	.
8940	1	a	Easily the best racing sim I've used
8942	1	a	love it yeah :D
8944	1	a	for a free to play game, not too bad. i didn't have to pay for anything and hot laps/time attack isn't too bad. if i want head to head racing i would expect to pay and i hear it isn't well balanced in pricing but the ability to use leaderboards/challenges for free isn't bad. the physics feel good, as do the circuit layout of the free tracks.
8946	1	a	This game is fantastic...the best game i've played.
8948	1	a	This Game got me to buy a wheel. Its very funny reading all the noobs put hurt on this game becuase its to hard ! If u love racing and hill climb get this game. PS the free game is great u don't even have to spend dosh lots of free content.
8950	1	a	Very good physic, perfect sounds. Only 3 things missing: Virtual currency and multiplayer, more hillclimb. If this game would be released for modding, we can expect the best circuit/rally racing ever.
8952	1	a	I noticed that most people who did a negative review of this game played less than 1 hour ...... If you ever like'd Race 07 , gtr , gtr2 etc etc , you like this game also . I first bought me a car to get out of the open servers and found a bunch of people who liked racing!!  There are always some servers with atleast 7 / 10 people around..  Tracks are nice and the physics &amp; force feedback are great , not to difficult to drive fast but to get that last second of you'r time you have to practise.. Default setups are not far off pace and enough to have a decent race with and be not the one at the back of the field.  After a while i bought me the packs i wanted and a few single cars to participate in online races in almost every class there is . So if you only like to drive online against other players the costs are not much more or equal as any other racing game. btw , single races with the purchased cars are possiblle (even championships) and you get the whole field of cars to that class (not driveable) for free so you don't race 25 the same cars that you have ( buy 1 gt3 and the whole gt3 pack race's with you) :) Great ! So next time you buy a beer in a bar , you have to think that that beer also could have been a nice GT3 in this game ...  Ohw yeah... BUY A WHEEL !!! and try again after your negative revieuw .... this is a SIM..   
8954	1	a	Speed as lightning.
8956	1	a	if need for speed and forza had a baby this would be it. It's a super fun arcade racer and still yet challenging. graphics are really good and the sounds are great too.
8958	1	a	A nice racing simulator for beginners and those who seek a challenge.
8960	1	a	Its a great simulator but a warning to people who are plaing to use their keyboard to controll the cars because once you press the key the stering wheel tunrs all the way and its extrmly hard to controll your car when you first start out
8962	1	a	this is a excellent race simulatsion. plus free to play
8964	1	a	I found my love in it.
8966	1	a	This is next-gen RACE 07, and it's excellent! You will need dedicated graphics and a steering wheel.  Negative reviews are all about pricing, and this really isn't expensive. You don't need to own every car and livery in the game. To race in a class, you need exactly one car, and several are already included for free. Pick up a few tracks and you're all set. You get custom championships and multiplayer.  Spa-Francorchamps at €5.49. Bliss!
8968	1	a	There seems to be a lot of negative reviews on Steam about this game, especially revolving around the pricing structure, and while I agree that the price looks quite high I have to say that I think the items are so good that to me they're worth the outlay. You get what you pay for and the quality here outshines any misgivings regarding prices.  Graphically it's stunning especially with everything turned high and running at 60fps with 22 cars on the track, for which I'm referring to DTM experience, but the hot lapping in the base game with Ai turned on gives you an insight into what the finished game will feel like and in my opinion they have got it spot on.  I can only assume that the base game is yet to be optimised because I get lower FPS on the same tracks, with only a couple of cars out than I do with the 22 cars in a full race of DTM. Same graphics settings for both but with a 10 fps drop in the base game? Sounds are incredible, I've never been so engrossed in the sounds of any game as this one and playing with headphones on just highlights the beauty of these cars. Gameplay is great especially on the Get Real setting, althought the Ai needs a little bit more speed as its currently too easy to catch and overtake. I'm currently using a Razer Sabertooth gamepad and once setup it works perfectly but I can only imagine how much more fun a steering wheel would make this and it's the game which will likely push me to make that commitment.  It's that good that I've bought pretty much most of the buyable stuff, except for a couple of livery options, within just a few days of trying it.  EDIT : May 26th 2016  After having set myself up with some decent hardware to get the most out of driving games I can say that this is my favourite driving experience on the PC. I own most if not all of the PC racing sims but there's something about Raceroom that makes it very special to me, and that's the feeling you get from the overall atmosphere that this sim creates. From the sounds to graphics to driving feel, once set up correctly this is such a cool experience with AI that can keep up and give you a thrilling racing experience.
8970	1	a	I won't give it a bad review, but you pretty much need a wheel and pedals to enjoy this game. Xbox controller is no bueno.  Tried it out on a weekend where everything is unlocked, but normally it appears that you would have to pay for most of the stuff (which is fine, if you like the game, then buy the content). It does appear to be pretty pricey if you buy everything though, even multiple or all the packs.
8972	1	a	fUN gAME STILL NEEDS SOME WORK STILL DONE STILL MISSING A COUPLE GOOD TRACKS BUT OVERALL 7.5/10
8974	1	a	Good Game And and nice cars
8976	1	a	This is one of the most fun racing games I've played in a long while. The content is all done really well and the driving experience is very immersive. The multiplayer netcode is fairly decent already for something in Alpha. It takes me back to when I first played Race07 way back when. Highly recommend this to anyone looking for a fun racing experience.
8978	1	a	Back when this game launched, it lacked even the basic functions of a racing sim, Offline AI race, Online multiplayer. Which of course deserved the hate and bashing.  Fast forward to current, all this had been implemented plus more. The sounds are awesome and properly captures how the real cars sound like. Unlike another sim who overexaggerates their car sounds till its ear hurting.  The only con is the confusing content purchase system, which are gradually getting better with the introduction of Packs.
8980	1	a	This game is a good start to driving sims. If you picked up your brand new 900-1080 degree FFB wheel and you got no money left over, look no further than this gem. The physics are on par with the lazer scaned iracing, and super car fun fest Asseto Corrsa. The begining cars and tracks are fun to learn, and really give you a sense of joy when shaving off 1/4 a second of a hotlap all while realizing how this is meaningless. There are 3 main modes of difficulty: Novice- Babies first racing sim, Amateur- X360 gamepad user, and Get Real- Why am I backwards and why is my front end smashed in? The only complaint is that the DLC is not only hard on the conusmer, it makes finding servers a living hell. The full experiece will cost you upwards of $100 and it is hard to justify that when other games cost around $50 and have the same content.
8982	1	a	Good Game And and nice cars
8984	1	a	So realistic simulation of speed and breaks it gazed my nervs!
8986	1	a	I downloaded this game at the beginning of the weekend, and I'm glad I did! Awesome free content. Although there's only a few cars to race with, you can try any of the cars in the game for free. There's only a few tracks for free, plenty more if you want to pay. So far, using the free cars and the free tracks, I'm definitely hooked! The sound effects are great, the cars sound like the real deal. Far better than most racing games, and in some ways, better than any racing game I've ever played. Yeah, it's that good! The physics are excellent, and you are given 3 choices for general set-up, abs,tcs,etc. I've found a happy medium with the middle choice, it lets me learn the cars and tracks easier. The tracks are beautiful, and have lots of elevation change, rumble strips, run-offs, etc. Again, I've personally only played on three of the tracks. I really like how you can set-up your race with practice and qualifying. This is something that seems lost on console racing games. My only real gripe thus far is the Ai. I've been racing with the adaptive Ai, which for one race was ridiculously easy, then the next race very hard. And going with that was the aggression of the Ai, when I braked a little earlier for a turn and got rear ended and booted from the track. Really? Sometimes damage seems to happen, other times, you can drive into a wall with no consequences. Glitch? But, gripes aside, this is a really well made game, and for free? Amazing! I will most likely end up buying more content when I get bored with the free stuff. I still can't get over the sounds!...
8988	1	a	So, I've played it for a little bit, and it's fun. There are only a few cars, and a few tracks, unless you're down to spend money, but that's fine with me. I don't know about the game modes, I just play time trials and try and beat myself. The cars which you have access to are quite powerful, and the sense of speed feels inaccurate - but could be that I'm used to games with more world detail, allowing for more points of reference thus a better perception of speed. Handling feels great, I don't feel that I had to adjust much - if at all - from the way I drive Codemasters games like Grid and DiRT [I think they make DiRT?? Yeah, pretty sure...]. RaceRoom doesn't seem to offer anything that any of the paid-for games I posess fail to present themselves, however I'll leave it on my drive and hope they update with some more free content. The build I played, I only recall the cars and tracks for sale and no ads.  EDIT: Oh, duh, and it works GREAT with my Logitech Driving Force Pro or GT or whatever it is. They allow you to fully customize all kinds buttons, which is neat. The hill climb in the BMW is a ton of fun, I really like that track.
8990	1	a	game has a lot of potential, if you dont like it then just give it time ;)
8992	1	a	RaceRoom is on par with eye candy, the driving is also nice. Worth checking out if you love racing.
8994	1	a	The handalling of the cars isnt as good as iRacing, but the selection of cars is amusing.   The fun of the game is all the time trial comps through-out the year.   Good Game 7/10
8996	1	a	its a really good game but i do not recommend to play it on a keyboard .
8998	1	a	I stopped played it after couples minutes since I don't like the way to handle the car. It's too stiff, and once I done a wrong control I have to restart the race instead getting back to drive. A car selection is also very limited (without spending money like buy a pack, of course). But it has a good graphic, and the game it self have a potential.  6/10 for me.
9000	1	a	Let me start off by saying this is an incredible game. There's lots of content and the game is growing bigger step by step. I'm going to dive into some subjects a lot of negative reviews talk about and try and explain my viewpoint on them.    Multiplayer    The multiplayer is currently still developping. There are dedicated servers, and you can create your own lobbies. Multiplayer at the moment isn't very crowded, however you can have some good and fun races.    Payment model    Contrary to the Free to Play tag this game isn't free to play. A better tag would be Free Demo, but it seems this can't be helped. I'm going to compare the game with league of legends, because it's a well known free to play game. In league of legends you earn in game currency for playing, and that currency can be used to buy things. Next to the ingame currency there is a currency buyable with irl money. In RaceRoom, there is no ingame currency, just vRP, which can be bought for irl money. That's also why I don't think the Free to Play tag applies.  Now on to the paymeny model. Paying 50€ upfront for a game and unlocking all the content is very nice, but there will most likely be content you don't like or feel like playing. In RaceRoom, tracks, cars, trackpacks and carpacks can be bought seperately. Say you don't like DTM, but do like GT2, then you can just buy the GT2 cars. One thing to note is that if you want all the items, you'll be looking at a price quite a bit higher than 50€. But to put his into perspective, in league of legends you pay +- 10€ for a champion, in RaceRoom you pay +- 2.5 euro for a car.  I should also note that content can be tested for free, so you have an idea whether or not you like it.    Interface    The interface has been upadtes, is new easy to navigate and comprehend, but you still need a mouse to be able to quickly navigate menu's    Some personal insight   I do believe you need a wheel to play this game. You can you a gamepad, but then you're just not getting the complete experience.   The sounds in the game are incredible, especially with the new transmission sound update.  Graphics are great and the game runs on older hardware however there is only Dx9 support if I'm not mistaken.   As an ending I'd say, try the game out, test drive some cars, and if you like it buy some cars you enjoy driving. 
9002	1	a	Very cool racing game! On the single player mode you can practice your for bots on the multiplayer mode and you can chase your friends. A game for those who do not want to spend money on games such. Need For Speed (In this case Shift). We have to pay for skins for cars, including maps because they are not all free. A nice little game I recommend :) 
9004	1	a	READ THIS. Before you download this 15gb game consider this: Do you like Quantity, or Quality? Quality? RaceRoom Racing Experience (R3E). Newer, better native support. If you play it though, expect having to dish out the dough for getting a amazing experience. $40 dollars can get you (if stuff is on sale, which is regularly is) 10-15 tracks, and 5-10 cars, some in 'packs.' The physics is great, the controls are amazing (I'm on a XBOX 360 controller), and the game just feels perfect. Personally I love the competitions of where its just you and the track and you try to get the best time out of EVERYONE. But you have to pay for everything. -vs- Quantity? Race07. Older game, but still holds up to date, if you want this game, get the SimBin Mega Bundle (same $40 dollars!) and get all the DLC and its 15$ less then buying all of them alone. The game has it's quirks and could have been better but is still an amazing racing game none-the-less. But it has loads and I mean LOADS of tracks and a nice array of cars.  You choose, and don't go hating on this game. It's certainly a different approach to paying into a game, but it is OK SimBin, OK.
9006	1	a	stunning graphics 
9008	1	a	good game and it's in multiplayer :3
9010	1	a	OMFG what a piece of ♥♥♥♥ING crap
9012	1	a	its only single player thou whats up with that  
9014	1	a	Awsome game, every racing fan should try it!!!
9016	1	a	A lot of impovements! guys REMEBER this, this sim is in the way to be the BEST race simulator. Dedicated server is on the corner, almost here! i completley recommend this game
9018	1	a	i dont know any more
9020	1	a	Lovely graphics you should also use a controller or a wheel to play this game NO keyboard
9022	1	a	why wont it launch
9024	1	a	I've been a bit critial of RR prevoiusly, but I just played WTCC 2013 and I have to say, wow one of the best single player experiences I've had in a sim. I own a good bit of RR content, but these cars feel the best out of the lot..... great job on the physics and the AI is brilliantly done!   Over all: Physics - B+ for WTCC cars (other GT cars are spotty) Graphics - meh C+ Sound - A+ AI - A (amazing AI)   Overall, well worth the 12 bucks I paid... what a bargan.
9026	1	a	Excellent. Vastly improved since the early days.
9028	1	a	Good simulator, some things to be done to improve this game.
9030	1	a	Not for the faint-hearted. A real driving simulator, unlike the arcade-style garbage saturating the games market. Only 2 tracks &amp; 5 cars in Free2Play mode but has replayability in that you are positioned on the real-time leaderboards. Definately a AAA title.
9032	1	a	Good simulator, some things to be done to improve this game.
9034	1	a	Among with the best (with Assetto Corsa) racing Sim ever !
9036	1	a	A glimpse into what SimBin is bringing in the future. Excellent. Cannot wait to see more.
9038	1	a	Don't even try this ♥♥♥♥.
9040	1	a	Nice graphyx and very realystic phisics!
9042	1	a	TOO MANY FURRY CIRCLEJERKS
9044	1	a	i obviously love this game because of the beautiful graphics but on the down side the physics suck for instance,you get in a wreck on the wall and you think you are going to flip over but no,you stay on 4 wheels,if you want to try this game i only recomend this game for everybody but mostly just amature computer racer gamers 
9046	1	a	This game seem very complex but interesting at the same time. Not played that much but i prefer to continue on Grid 2 for the moment.
9048	1	a	Hi,how i can play with my friends?plz send me a message if you know :-|
9050	1	a	♥♥♥♥ raceroom it never work! 
9052	1	a	As a simracing beginner I have to say that I like this title. The feeling of the car is very good and the sound is just awesome. I can not describe how good and realistic it is. The apex hunt feature has helped me as a beginner to reduce my lap times and learn the tracks and breaking points. Ok there are some negative points aswell, such as missing night/day features, weather and multiplayer. Another negative point is that if you want all of the content such as tracks, cars and liveries, you better start saving up some money because it is very expensive. The overall image is good I think but not perfect. It is a developing product so it is improved with every update and the fact that it is more or less free to play ( you can drive 2 cars on one track and participate in challenges) should encourage everyone to at least try it out. I would highly suggest it for those who are simracing beginners or for those who want to see if they like simracing or not.
9054	1	a	After I dialed in my FFB and Degrees of rotation properly, I was hooked. To me, the graphics are beautiful. The physics are fantastic. The sound is obviously amazing. I just want my AI single player experience already. But this sim feels, sounds, and looks very good; and once its fully finished (if ever) I'll be spending many YEARS with it. Just dial in your settings correctly and you'll see what I mean. My FFB is set to just 27 strength and the FFB effects are set to full with 400 degrees of rotation set to BOTH - my Fanatec Porsche GT3 wheel AND in game. Can't wait to race you guys!
9056	1	a	R3E = GTR 3 (at least Simbin's working steadily and trying not to make any mistakes).
9058	1	a	Detail and overall gameplay are fantastic.
9060	1	a	DIS GAYME LIKE WHEN ALL THE LITTLE KIDS GATHER ROUND FOR CHRISTMAS AND THEN SANTA CLAUS BUST UP IN THE ♥♥♥♥♥ LIKE HO HEY HO MOFOS IMMA BOUT TO BRING PRESENTS FOR ALL OF YOU LITTLE KIDS. THE KIDS GOT SCARED AND RAN INTO THEIR HOMES HIDING FROM SANTA, BUT THEY DID NOT KNOW THAT SANTA KNOWS WHERE THEY ARE THANKS TO HIS MAGIC CONCH SHELL (FEATURED IN MTV CRIBS WITH MIKE LASOWSKI). THE KIDS WERE THEN ALL GIVEN THEIR PRESENT, THIS GAME.
9062	1	a	Loved GTR and GTR 2, so had high hopes for Simbins later efforts. The DLC model or whatever it is just puts me off. I once liked that a bunch of people had access to a beautiful simlulator of a game; the same game, and not some people having access to some tracks while others don't. Still, it's the future, right?
9064	1	a	dont play this game it sucks end of story
9066	1	a	What's not to like? it's free to play, there is a lot of content as well as cool comps! All around it's a decent simulator as well.  Give it a go...
9068	1	a	I'll recommend to try this sim. because it's free :) Nice graphics, quite good physics, but very bad business model. It's very expensive if you want to have all the stuff. I'm big SimBin fan and I was waiting for this game very long, but now I'm dissapointed.. They have ruined this game with this type of business model. But how I've said already, it is WORTH IT TO TRY! Maybe You gone like it more than I :)
9070	1	a	Free to play? Why don't they just come clean and call it a demo? Because the game options are totally crippled unless you starts spending RL cash to expand it, and I'm not talking about getting loads for free here, you get hardly anything in the basic dowload, even by Demo standards it is badly limited.
9072	1	a	I don't like the game. Unclear interface (primarily how to get online games going) And the graphics are not holding me very well either. Sound is also quite bad.
9074	1	a	did anyone play it? what about it? sorry i can not type chinese and i kown why
9076	1	a	Pretty good game considering its free but is rubish unless you have a steering wheel and pedals.
9078	1	a	good but hell of a time with the stock cars
9080	1	a	realy good sim
9082	1	a	Well , this game is for free or not ? When i try to create an new account it says something about an redeem come .. 
9084	1	a	its great
9086	1	a	great game ove the cars and graphics of the track but i wish there is muliplayer
9088	1	a	cant exit the game but really cool game you sould download it though
9090	1	a	Love this game!
9092	1	a	this is great game
9094	1	a	This is, in my opinion, one of the best and most realisitc racing simulators for people who are not willing to spend tons of money on an over the top, in depth racing simulator.
9096	1	a	nice one racing sim!
9098	1	a	Great Racing Sim for PC Finally...
9100	1	a	Its quiite good if u want a racing game because its free but its really hard to stear with arrow keys i think it would be alot easier with a joystick
9102	1	a	Good Racer Game
9104	1	a	Best physics engine and driving model on the market, full stop. For players that want an accurate driving simulator and nothing else. Plenty of free content and enthusiasts will end up splurging some cash on cars and tracks.
9106	1	a	I'd say, quite arcade with sim elements, wait till multiplayer comes out! It doesn't have the best physics or ffb, damage doesn't exist, put damage onm in the menu, 200 kph into a wall, no damge... ._. Cars and tracks are good quality, (apart from the physics) not that expensive, you can test some cars for free! But it's still an Alpha, Simbin says it's beta but it's just an Alpha.
9108	1	a	This game is a free-game which is really interesting, and nice physics of driving, but you need to give money to earn new cars and that sucks hard. Fun for a little ride, but i dont think it'll last long.
9110	1	a	graphically the best iv'e ever seen, driving feels awsome some people say its a little arcadey but feels real enough for me and the sounds are pretty amazing! cost, well...sucks a big one im tired of so called free to play(pay to play) these were called demos back in the day. people everywhere are taking advantage of this gimmic. pay should be optional for those that 1 have the money 2 cant wait or 3 suck at gaming and will otherwise not experience the full game, and should not be a requirement. to me thats gonna be the death for many games and maybe this one as well, and this game is looking real good. it cost 3 times as much to own all the content right now than to own a full game with ten times as much content...no thanks i would have really enjoyed this game but am stuck with whatever is free. guess this game is for enthusiests and the rich oh well on to the next. i do recomend it if you can afford it or want to try the 'demo'   after totaling up the cost, i just spent it on early access of AC hope its good   ps: if using a wheel make sure its set to 900 degrees a must or sucks. tip logitech pro ulocks with select r3 and right shift button at the same time
9112	1	a	im getting an error report when i attempt to log in any ideas,?
9114	1	a	A pretty nice racing game, not to happy about how almost all of the game is DLC add on though
9116	1	a	good game. handling lil tuff but good and realistic
9118	1	a	Cool :)
9120	1	a	DTM Experience (purchasable in-game) is overpriced. 40e does not represent the quality of this game as it is. I'd say 20e would be a good price, 25e a decent price and 30e a high-end price. 40e is simply too much unless the 1.0 version of this game will be of significant better quality, which I think it will be because it's only in beta0.2 at this point. So. Nice game, but needs plenty of development and as is, it's overpriced.
9122	1	a	game over yeah!
9124	1	a	.
9126	1	a	I run Race 07 The same people same game but no online sales.   I never race online. Nor do i intend to.
9128	1	a	A pretty nice racing game, not to happy about how almost all of the game is DLC add on though
9130	1	a	This is pure simulator with almost none of virtual help, it's all up to you and your driving style, I love that in simulators when they just put you in action and leave you to learn about the game through the gameplay. When I started playing I thought this game is all about paying for extra stuff. Yea, it is expensive as hell, but its a good game. Sure, only 1 fictional track for use is terrible. The sound is awesome and so are the physics.  First feel: 6/10  Gameplay: 9/10  Controller support: 9/10  Physics 9/10 - Driving: 10/10  Crashing physics: 10/10  Crash damage: 3/10   Sound: 11/10  Price: 3/10  Overall game experience: 9/10 - Very fun but very expensive and a lot of locked stuff ruins the fun gameplay. Especially if you have to pay for every car and track. Edit: Most of the competitions lend you everything neccessery for racing, so you can explore new cars and tracks. That feature is very good.
9132	1	a	I'm really torn with this one. I love the driving experience, but the fact you only get one car in the free version really takes makes it hard to recommend. It needs at least two more cars and tracks to play before you are forced to dip into your pocket. It's a shame they've gone this route and really limited the playability.   I'd say get it IF you're prepared to pay for extra contect. If not, then it's not worth the download. I'm giving it a thumbs up because what is there, is great.
9134	1	a	Its Good But Their Has Been Better!
9136	1	a	First game i ever got on steam Nice game, but you should make custom paint because I do not like pink mustangs

9146	1	a	'Automatically detects and pre-loads the needed profiles and assets for supported peripherals such as wheels and Joy Pads.' Why won't my 360 controller work, then?
9148	1	a	played this for a while then gets really boring
9150	1	a	great racing sim. wide selection of detailed cars/classes and courses that are updated quite frequently. offciall DTM, WTCC, ADAC series, with all cars, liveries and tracks. amazing sound. FFB is great, strong, detailed and realistic. the settings are not too complicated to adjust to personal taste. people complain about it being not being free...of course it isn't, but you pay for what you are interested in, and there are always things on sale.  overall, one of my favorite sims. the devs are always improving it and adding new content.
9152	1	a	best racing game i played on steam so far! im impressed
9154	1	a	I do recommend this game because to me it feels very genuine, and especially the track layouts are very accurate. The graphics are fantastic, except for the surroundings of the track, but who really cares about that...? It's fun, lot to discover, tracks to learn, cars to handle and the buyable content is a very smart move by the producer,(because you'll want more and more content each priced quite fairly) but also for the customer to spend as much or as little as he himself desires. Good game! I'm looking forward to even more classes and tracks in the future.
9156	1	a	This is the worse driving simulator I have ever played, My Xbox 360 controller works but not perfectly!
9158	1	a	Has multiplayer in Alpha now! Progress, sweet progress! :)
9160	1	a	Absolute must for everyone that has a wheel at home. The sound and visuals are just stunning. Cars and tracks are redicilously cheap as well. Not to mention that you can win lifetime supplies of Credits by just being fast :)
9162	1	a	Fast, reasonably realistic with a OK expense. There are better, but there are also much worse racing games.
9164	1	a	played this for a while then gets really boring
9166	1	a	I must say,...RaceRoom Racing Experience, is the best Road Racing Simulation I have used to date!!!  Hats off to All Engineers involved in this product.  Cheers, Michael Giles Tomah, Wisconsin U.S.
9168	1	a	This game looks awesome and its free. Free is never truly free, but that is the marketing model.  This game will continue to develope for years to come. This game has come a long way since 2009. Thats right, 2009. its been reworked alot of times, and its always getting better.   This is one of the most fair free to play models in the market. Each track takes hundreds of hours of work. Some of the newer tracks have the cost of laser scanning on top of the time to write it.   Nearly every game out today sells dlc. This base game is free. You $40 to $60 ahead just for trying it. If you like it, then get what you like. If not, at least you did not blow $40 to $60 for a game you only play once in a while.     The cars that come with the game are good enough to get a feel for the game, but if you like the game your gonna need to buy the tracks and cars you want. There are packs available to save you some money. You will probably spend $60 to $80 for the content you want if you like the game. All the content is about $250 or so.  I used this on my Fanatec Wheel, and my x360 controller, both play well.  At this current time most of what this game has to offer surpasses every other sim I have played including A/C. When A/C first came out, it had this beat. Now with a few updates later, it is better both graphically and in terms of physics.  I only wish the game had Daytona Road Course.  I have been a supporter of this game long before it was ported to steam. About 2009 or so. This game really does continue to get developed.
9170	1	a	A great free to play simulator. It has better graphics than Simraceway, and the sound quality is seccond to none! This is the level of quality I have come to expect from a great publisher like SIMBIN and this is no exception. The physics model is continually updated and they now even simulate transmission wear! There is also a chance to try out each and every car before you buy it. I wish the same could be said for tracks; however, once again, SIMBIN is more generous than most, if not all, in this category. Even if you are skeptical, try it out. If you don't like it, uninstal it.   I highly reccomend this to everyone from sim junkies to those who just want an upgrade from Need For Speed. The highly customizable dificulty threshold means that RaceRoom is a simulator which you can grow with and (crucially, for me) does not continually hemmoarge your wallet (cough, cough, iRacing) during the process. Unlike many games, you truly have nothing to lose beyond a few minutes of your time. In my case, I wasn't dissapointed in the slightest.
9172	1	a	Very Cool Raceing game with online multiplayer.... And ... Take your sits please...... ITS FREEEEEEEEEEEEE :D
9174	1	a	Amazing quality and realism for a free game. You only get a few tracks and a few cars though.
9176	1	a	I found my love in it.
9178	1	a	I must say,...RaceRoom Racing Experience, is the best Road Racing Simulation I have used to date!!!  Hats off to All Engineers involved in this product.  Cheers, Michael Giles Tomah, Wisconsin U.S.
9180	1	a	This is next-gen RACE 07, and it's excellent! You will need dedicated graphics and a steering wheel.  Negative reviews are all about pricing, and this really isn't expensive. You don't need to own every car and livery in the game. To race in a class, you need exactly one car, and several are already included for free. Pick up a few tracks and you're all set. You get custom championships and multiplayer.  Spa-Francorchamps at €5.49. Bliss!
9182	1	a	2015 pay to wn experience
9184	1	a	worst ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥ game ever :(
9186	1	a	this is a great game for a good racing experiance :)
9188	1	a	intense, immersive, amazing. Forget it without a wheel.
9190	1	a	There seems to be a lot of negative reviews on Steam about this game, especially revolving around the pricing structure, and while I agree that the price looks quite high I have to say that I think the items are so good that to me they're worth the outlay. You get what you pay for and the quality here outshines any misgivings regarding prices.  Graphically it's stunning especially with everything turned high and running at 60fps with 22 cars on the track, for which I'm referring to DTM experience, but the hot lapping in the base game with Ai turned on gives you an insight into what the finished game will feel like and in my opinion they have got it spot on.  I can only assume that the base game is yet to be optimised because I get lower FPS on the same tracks, with only a couple of cars out than I do with the 22 cars in a full race of DTM. Same graphics settings for both but with a 10 fps drop in the base game? Sounds are incredible, I've never been so engrossed in the sounds of any game as this one and playing with headphones on just highlights the beauty of these cars. Gameplay is great especially on the Get Real setting, althought the Ai needs a little bit more speed as its currently too easy to catch and overtake. I'm currently using a Razer Sabertooth gamepad and once setup it works perfectly but I can only imagine how much more fun a steering wheel would make this and it's the game which will likely push me to make that commitment.  It's that good that I've bought pretty much most of the buyable stuff, except for a couple of livery options, within just a few days of trying it.  EDIT : May 26th 2016  After having set myself up with some decent hardware to get the most out of driving games I can say that this is my favourite driving experience on the PC. I own most if not all of the PC racing sims but there's something about Raceroom that makes it very special to me, and that's the feeling you get from the overall atmosphere that this sim creates. From the sounds to graphics to driving feel, once set up correctly this is such a cool experience with AI that can keep up and give you a thrilling racing experience.
9192	1	a	Love this game. Sort of a good cross between pCars and Assetto Corsa. No muss or fuss. Sit down and start racing. The DLC model is a little complicated, but once you figure that out, you're good to go!
9194	1	a	This is the best racing simulation game I've ever played. It's free to play, and the initial package is good. The DLC is great too. Every serious sim-racer should try it. Since it is free, what have you got to lose.
9196	1	a	Greatly improved. I played a bit in June and was let down overall. Recent updates have overhauled the menu system (yay) and improved the in-game feel of the cars, as well as added aditional free content.  This is still a free-to-play title, with everything that that entails. However, the DTM dlc's are basically separate games that launch from the main menu. And, the 2013 DTM content is playable from within the main R3E.
9198	1	a	good game i love it. I just figured out how to turn on assists so sorry about the bad review
9200	1	a	Great physics and gameplay. Terrible pay wall, probably the worst on the steam store.
9202	1	a	best racing Sim ever made
9204	1	a	Good simulator for good players ;)
9206	1	a	I enjoyed this game it had pretty good graphics.
9208	1	a	Awesome racing game if you are in to racing games
9210	1	a	Overall, Very funt to play and good overall experience.  PROS: - Excellent and varied track selection, with many tracks you can't find anywhere else - Some unique and older cars [especially 70's and 80's DTM and Touring cars] - Excellent engien sounds - good force feedback [Drive Force GT]  CONS: - multiplayer is still alpha
9212	1	a	Good fun realistic game. I think that all difficulties should be able to setup their cars and tweak them like in 'Get Real'. Very fun game.
9214	1	a	i really like this racing game and its free
9216	1	a	Before i start i need to ell you that this should neither have thumbs up or down.  (Expand the page for the more positive stuff)  At first i posted a negative review because of its STUPID FREE TO PLAY mecanic and how they charge crasy amounts of money to play more than the bad cars (that i have not tuched since i bought DTM Experience) on Raceroom Raceway and Portimao to be able to really enjoy the game. just take a track for example, a less known and popular track costs 3€ and a legendary track like SPA and Monza costs 5€. And the cars, just to buy 1 car (with all paintjobs for it) it costs 3€. To not pay as much i recomend buying one of the EXPERIENCE packs like DTM and ADAC to get some good cars and tracks.  Apart from that stupid pay system the game is good. they update the game regulary and are adding new things now and then. The physics are good but not perfict. The sound is great. The visuals are amazing. The adaptive AI should mark a milestone in racing sims and are the greatest feature. If you pay for the stuff in game you will get an amazing game.
9218	1	a	This is a must have for every sim racer out there. And the sound is the best your ever hear 😃
9220	1	a	Great physics and gameplay. Terrible pay wall, probably the worst on the steam store.
9222	1	a	it is a good game but the steering is difficult and there is not much customisation towards the start of the game.(like more than one car and one track). they should take a leaf out of Forza Motorsports' book.
9224	1	a	excellent racing simulator there is a lot of content you have to buy including cars and tracks but i will list all of the items you will have. Lakeview hillclimb, Portmiao Circuit (or Algarve GP) , RaceRoom Raceway, Aquila CR1 Sports GT, Saleen S7R, 134 Judd V8, DMD P20, DMD P21, Mistral M530, Mistral M531, Canhard R51, Canhard R52, Cougar C14-1, Cougar C14-2. This is it but there are loads of other cars that you test drive for free whenever you want and as many times as you want. The tracks unfortunately are not testable. Any DLC cars can NOT be used in races or Championships.
9226	1	a	Best F2P racing simulator, great physics, great contests, a lot of fun for petrolhead.
9228	1	a	best racing Sim ever made
9230	1	a	I honestly have no experience when it comes to playing these games, but I was happy to have the experience to. When I first got onto an online race, I went offtrack several times. I think it takes skill and practice to really master the game. I had fun playing though, some people hit me in the back because of how slow I go on turns (I don't want to cut the track). Overall, takes practice to become great, but still fun.
9232	1	a	Load game. Create profile. Get excited due to good looking graphics. Find out 99% of the content has to be brought. Start a practice session. Hold down accelerator. Spin into the wall. Change to 3rd person and mouse controls. Fail to go round a corner in gear 2. Get crashed on pit straight. Decide to start a race. 'Accidentally' crash someone. End up on my roof and the person who I hit is still going perfectly. 11/10. Brilliant
9234	1	a	Note that this really is not a free to play simulation. The free content is no good. To see what this is all about you have to spend cash to get the good packs.   Basically it is like this:   If you follow real life racing and have a 250 usd+ steering wheel setup and knowledge of and love for real life racing dynamics... and 100 usd+ to spend on content. Then this is your sim.   It is hands down the best simulation of actual RACING ever made and with the recent updates it is very close to life like racing. Now that adaptive ai is working it is also the best simulation for single player.   The fact that physics are developed in unison with the real DTM/TT drivers (whom you also see sometimes online) as well as the general engine being awesome makes this the best package right now if you have all prerequisites. If not you will not like it.   You need:   Expensive steering wheel set (without this, do not get it) 100 USD cash for different content (without this, do not get it)  Real life racing knowledge (without this, do not get it)  Following of real life racing and a love for actual track racing (without this, do not get it)    So, disregard the free to play thing. This is a hardcore platform for simulation racing, with a good single player structure as well.    If you like some more casual 'game' style get Project Cars If you like hot-lapping with road cars get Assetto Corsa If you like to devote 16 hours a day towards virtual league racing and disregard the rest of your life, get rFactor2   If you want a good simulation of actual racing, that is also a good single player, offline experience and need a full simulation model, get this
9236	1	a	This is the most realistic driving simulator ive ever played you can do various challenges that pop up or you can do a time trial on your own and along with fastastic phisics, Graphics and decent challenges there is no price tag whatsoever so you can just download and play takes about an hour to download and the phisics of the game may take some getting used to but once you play the game for an hour or two I would highly recommend this game who is prepared for the learning curve and want to try something new
9238	1	a	Very very fun I love the animations on it and the feel since I have a XBOX Driving wheel and pedals :)
9240	1	a	its just fun if you spent your money on the adac or dtm 2014 otherwise not really
9242	1	a	hand brake doesnt working this is awesome game if can handbrake
9244	1	a	This game is realistic, fun, and not complicated. The only problem ive found with it, is of course, you can hardly run it on a mid-high end laptop.
9246	1	a	So far so good with an Xbox 360 controller. I need to try it with a wheel then compare the driving experience with other sims before I come to a conclusion on which is best for me.
9248	1	a	This game is an evolving product. It's already awesome, but with the addon 'Experiences' the sky's the limit.
9250	1	a	Better than expected. I like the HD-Quality
9252	1	a	so when i got my very first laptop i got the game go i spent 20 minuets trying to play 1 minutet lagging to hell i could'nt move and 1 min ctl-alt-del
9254	1	a	A great raceing sim, the best sounds I've experienced in any sim racing to date. If your looking for GT racing this has to be experienced! Highly recommend!
9256	1	a	nice graphics and good detailed gameplay =)
9258	1	a	its a good game 
9260	1	a	when thou dost overtake me, wimp)
9262	1	a	The games is pretty nice in my oppinion. The sound and graphics are ok but the cars feel really nice and also i think that the tracks have a lot of nice small details on them. Also it's a free to play game so why not try it. Also it's not pay to win.
769	0	a	  Full of exploiters 
9264	1	a	wtf no menu plz fix i need to be playin this again
9266	1	a	its awesome 
9268	1	a	I actually don’t recommend RaceRoom Racing Experience BUT...  I took a moment to look through some of the positive and negative reviews prior to writing this and realized some things which actually changed my opinion of the game from the perspective of functional game content.  The one criticism I have which has not changed is the sound. I’m not a professional racer, I don’t know what it sounds like to be behind the wheel of one of these monstrosities, but when I play a racing game with a 5.1 surround system I expect it to feel raw and powerful. Instead, I found all of the vehicles to sound unbelievably anemic and whiny. Again, I have no idea what these cars may sound like in real life, but this is a game. It’s disappointing to see such aggressive speed machines yet hear whiny little RC cars.  Now one of the first things I learn was that this is (at least in some capacity) the same people responsible for Race07. I recently gave that game a whirl and had a nauseatingly terrible experience with it. Whatever they learned from those past titles they have clearly refined it and mastered it for RaceRoom. I know a lot of time has passed between the two, but it’s hard to think this quality sim is from the same people behind Race07. Great job, devs; keep up the iteration and self improvement!  The next thing I took a step back from complaining about was the Free-to-Play model. Many of the negative reviews pointed out the frankly incomprehensible way in which content is being sold. I think the model is confusing and poorly thought out, but I don’t think the fact that you are expected to pay for the majority of the cars when the game and a handful of vehicles are completely free is a point to merit a negative review. The game is extremely detailed and - as best I can tell - extremely faithful to the physics behind circuit racing. RaceRoom isn’t a Free-to-Play racing game in my eyes; it’s a demo for a well crafted racing simulator that allows you to pay for exactly the content you want if you decide that the mechanics interest you.  I didn’t much enjoy it, but RaceRoom Racing Experience is a free demo for a very high quality racing simulator. If you’re into this genre and like what you see in the screenshots, you should absolutely try out the game. There is literally nothing to lose by trying it out.
9270	1	a	awsome racing game plz make raceroom 2
9272	1	a	this game is hard 
9274	1	a	this game is amazing
9276	1	a	10/10 A brilliant and enjoyable racing game fantastic for free to play!
9278	1	a	This is a highly realistic racing game that easily beats most others in fun and misfortune. Amazing for recording videoes and competative gameplay! Why purchase a wannabe game when this beast shows you the greatest experience for free, charging you for extras! Note: There is a practice mode for those who do not want to race right away. You can get used to the gameplay!
9280	1	a	probably one of the best sim's out there. May I say no more

9306	1	a	Okay, you guys who read me might say: 'This guys doesn't know the f*ck he's talking about, he only has 4.4 hrs on record!'...but hear me out real quick; I've played simulation games since my young age back in the days with Gran Turismo 1 on the 1st PS system, and I can tell you that on the 'sim' side of things, this game nails it badly.   1) The sounds are majestic: all the cars that I've bought for DLC and that I've heard in real life sound exactly the same...I've been waiting for a long time for this to happen in a video game (Zonda R = music to my ears, you must try that car out). 2) The graphics aren't 'Project Cars'-like, but they certainly do please my eyes... 3) Its free....so you have nothing to loose...try it out with the few cars/tracks that they offer and see for yourself if you want to get into the game deeper with the tons of add-ons that they offer at a fair price for their content :) 4) It doesn't take a deadly gaming setup to run it on a decent quality and decent FPS rate (im running a GTX 750Ti, probably the most mid-range GPU u could have, with a 4th gen i5 and 8 GB of RAM, and I run the game maxed out at around 100 FPS, sometimes going down to 40-50FPS when big crashes happen).  On the negative side of things, I would recommend that, if you really like this game, you should invest in a good quality wheel (a simple low-range logitec runs like a dream on mine), but most racing simulator fans already have one just like me... All that said, I hope this was helpfull to you, and note that this game is used by some professional drivers to test their skills on some tracks, just to prove that the simulation is mostly flawless...
9308	1	a	this game is hard

9312	1	a	yes, it is nice. good realism, but the bad side is that EVERY-♥♥♥♥ING-THING you need to pay. That's bad, and there's only single player.
9314	1	a	its a bit finnicky, but its pretty good
9316	1	a	awsome racing game plz make raceroom 2
771	0	a	take to long to load and my controler dont work on it and the price for it to much for a game
9318	1	a	As of right now this game only has one track and this Teaser feels like a alpha since there is not much to do in the game as of right now. The cars mechanics are not that smooth and it can get out of control really easy if you fall off the track just a little. The graphics look decent. The sound of the car are not the best sounding. It has potential though and we will see when the time comes if this game has what it takes to become a really good racing game.
772	0	a	Simply put, everyone's right. The game is ♥♥♥♥. You get like...1 car and 1 map for free.  Controls are attrocious and you will find yourself crashing often.   F2P, P2W. (Free to play. Pay to win) Though I don't know how anyone can win with controls like these.    Get this crap off my library...
773	0	a	Too complicated and really hard to start as a beginner. The controls are not intuitive at all and it's so realistic that your car is impossible to handle. Even if it offers good graphics and nice simulation it's not the best racing game you would want to play.
9320	1	a	Such a maze ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) Best game ever 10/10 would race Sebastian Loeb again ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡ °)  ╚( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) ╚(███) ╚(███) .╚(███) ..╚(███) …╚(███) …╚(███) ..╚(███) .╚(███) ╚(███) .╚(███) ..╚(███) …╚(███) …╚(███) …..╚(███) ……╚(██) ………(█) ……….*
9322	1	a	RaceRoom Racing Experience shows nice feeling of speed.  People who are new to this Game can't even drive Straight. They just spin out. :)  It is very fun to play this Game after arcade-styled games. Cars that i tryed feels different, sounds are great. If you got fancy desktop you'll get fancy graphics. But if you don't, there is Low Graphical options.  My setup is Mouse + Keyboard. Edit:Thanks to helpful stranger on steam forums, i got point to Logitech Momo. So i got black used Momo, and with ffb 75% it is even more fun and with 100% it is stunning racing game. Pedals help just so... much to not spin at corners.  I riding here for a month now on free cars and tracks. If you want more cars and tracks you can always buy them from in-game store.
9324	1	a	Please Give me this code
9326	1	a	Okay, you guys who read me might say: 'This guys doesn't know the f*ck he's talking about, he only has 4.4 hrs on record!'...but hear me out real quick; I've played simulation games since my young age back in the days with Gran Turismo 1 on the 1st PS system, and I can tell you that on the 'sim' side of things, this game nails it badly.   1) The sounds are majestic: all the cars that I've bought for DLC and that I've heard in real life sound exactly the same...I've been waiting for a long time for this to happen in a video game (Zonda R = music to my ears, you must try that car out). 2) The graphics aren't 'Project Cars'-like, but they certainly do please my eyes... 3) Its free....so you have nothing to loose...try it out with the few cars/tracks that they offer and see for yourself if you want to get into the game deeper with the tons of add-ons that they offer at a fair price for their content :) 4) It doesn't take a deadly gaming setup to run it on a decent quality and decent FPS rate (im running a GTX 750Ti, probably the most mid-range GPU u could have, with a 4th gen i5 and 8 GB of RAM, and I run the game maxed out at around 100 FPS, sometimes going down to 40-50FPS when big crashes happen).

9328	1	a	I'd highly suggest a racing wheel!
774	0	a	Simply put, everyone's right. The game is ♥♥♥♥. You get like...1 car and 1 map for free.  Controls are attrocious and you will find yourself crashing often.   F2P, P2W. (Free to play.

775	0	a	Force feedback is about the same as Dirt 1. All the cars feel like your screaming out of control in a shopping cart. Physics are really off. Do any of the developers actually have drivers licenses and have ever driven a real car?  AI is horrible, there is no awareness of other vehicles and they will simply slam into you. They drive like they are on a train track not a road.
9330	1	a	Don't play this game.
9332	1	a	RaceRoom is truly awesome and flawless, the game play, the way the car handles and look is fantastic, I play on a laptop and use a controller so for me its totally awesome in either single, multi-player mode or in a challenge, all is easy to access from the menu, Plus, before you buy a car you get to try it, woohoo, most good games here are $40 to $100 and I havnt spent anywhere near that in this game and I own a number of cars and tracks, So yea I recommend this game to all fellow racers, grab the game and look in your rear-view mirror, wait, too late, I just passed you.
9334	1	a	Nice game
9336	1	a	hey Project Cars,go ♥♥♥♥ yourself
9338	1	a	Great sim!
9340	1	a	First of all, I think DTM Experience might be the best racing simulation out there. I hope that RaceRoom emulates it more and more as I'm sure it will. Raceroom itself is still in beta and therefore it doesn't have much other than doing practice sessions with AI. I took advantage of a sale recently and got all RaceRoom content for about $70. That's a few dozen cars and 15-20 tracks I think. That's a great price especially compared to another race sim that I've spent about $1,000 on (iRacing). RaceRoom is a lot of fun.   DTM is a little lacking in content (no pit stops, no rain, no mp) but some of that should come later. At least I know the multiplayer will. Even though it's lacking in content it is one very, very good racing simulation. I highly recommend it.
779	0	a	160 dollars in dlc. here's a better business model: make the game 15 dollars and you won't have to pray and beg for people to buy overpriced DLC.
9342	1	a	a nice free racing game!! super cool  only 1 thing.... i need to buy so many race classes and tracks... so many....
9344	1	a	I cannot get any Vrp on this amazing game
9346	1	a	Drives 1 inch off a straight line: 'Lap invalidated due to corner cutting'  10/10 would throw PC out the Window again
9348	1	a	It`s a fun racing game that you don`t need to pay for...!
9350	1	a	UH I DON'T EVEN NEED TO EXPLAIN
9352	1	a	AMAZING RACING GAME REALLY BRILLIANT TEXTURES. A SOLID 11/10
9354	1	a	I love it. I like the physics, graphics and sound. Great multiplayer enviroment and servers.
782	0	a	this is rubbish lol stick to race07 gtr evo or even better buy assetto corsa this is waste of money and band width i really hope this aint gtr 3 in disguise
783	0	a	  Pros:  + Cars drive, feel and look great + Amazing sound + Good immersion and sense of speed + Amount of quality content + Test drive all cars before buying + Free competitions with the possibility to try out a big variation of content + Comes with 2 free tracks and a few cars + Solid netcode and fun multiplayer + Gamepad support  Cons:  - Obscure payment model with in-game virtual currency and microtransactions - Overpriced content (even with the regular discounts) - Not much going on in multiplayer. For paid content it's even worse. - The vast amount of microtransactions split the small public multiplayer community even further.  Conclusion:  This could be one of the most fun and populated racing sims out there if not for the publishers greedy payment/business model. Actually I like the idea to only pay for the content I want. Buy all tracks and your favourite cars of the series you want to race in and you're all set. But in reality the way it is now it doesn't work out. The pricing is not clear and fair enough. The public multiplayer community is split and barely alive. There is not enough going on online to justify buying the content. I was torn between giving the game a thumbs up or down. But from my personal point of view it all comes down to the questionable business model imposed by the publisher which keeps the game from being populated and more successful. In the current state I simply cannot recommend it to someone who likes to race online a lot.
784	0	a	Graphics are pretty good, Vehicle physics and XBox 360 Controller support aren't so good.
785	0	a	This game is crap. This game might be free-to-play but other games like warframe offer better quality than this. The steering is some of the worst i have ever seen in my life the car floats around the like its on ice, the engine sounds are decent but dont make up for the rest of the game. In summary dont install this game it really is crap
786	0	a	 Confuse menu, less tracks and cars, too expensive if you want to have all till now in the game -.-   And when we talk for shopping ... i don't saw option for testing a car before i buy it (sry if i miss it), that will be so nice in case i don't like the car ... why i need to buy it?  Just a demo of the future game and i cant feel so big different between free cars -.- Not so big step forward of Race 07 only graphic changes and some problem fix.
787	0	a	Had more than the system to run it. the controls are off, Not the greratest gameplay either.
9356	1	a	A good racing sim, loads of cars to choose
788	0	a	Nearly impossible to play without controller or racing wheel.
9358	1	a	but they have to introduce the multiplayer :\
9360	1	a	i played it with keyboard.. its not that great .. i think you need a steering wheel for this game. The movment of the steering looks reaally weird if you use keyboard. The graphics are very nice, menu and webpage are awesome. I wait until xmas then i will give it another shoot with my steering wheel.
789	0	a	4/10 which is halved of what i'd give it normaly due to lies about this being full game.  + Graphics Sound Performance Adjusting difficulity - Somehow allways feels fair no matter what you set as diff %  - Demo verssion not a free game inspite of how it is presented (Halving the score) Very uninspired track selection (give me something original! - Tatra test track and such) very uninspired vehicle selection (most of it is locked behind paywall annyways) Frusrating lack of value on Packs of cars/livieries/tracks (20ish EUR per one and you get like 8 EUR tracks?!)  I did enjoy this game once i realised that it is DEMO but i would very much appritiate if i was told that it is DEMO prior to playing it, the initiall shock was bad.    Game looks and feels great, what little of it i did play allways seemed to be good and difficulity of it was (inspite of my lack of skill) allso fairly aceptable. I did not encounter anny game breaking bugs and my constant out of track ventures were due to lack of skill. So they did pretty god job on that front and i praise that.  Trying to play championship with 2 tracks is stupid tho so i am not inclied to dignify this point too much: content is excellent for DEMO, pathetic for annything but demo.  Car selection is not too sad tho you only have access to 2 overarching categories (prototype and can cars) couple of choicess within each one, fairly solid content for this demo.  I did have major problem orienting myselve in menu, the track, car icons are way too large, list that would expand once you click the specific icon would be better. Furthermore structure of the menu itselve is kinda wonky - it'd be great if you could select category (prototype, can, formula, etc) than went to brand or year selection and than chose liviery. Right now you choose year AND category on one screen (WTCC 2013 example) and than individuall vehicle. it is not very intuitive is what i am aluring to.  Another missed oportunity and another damned Freemium demo. Skip this game and opt in for something more substantial.
9362	1	a	EDIT: its been a long while but the previous info still seems true. RaceRoom Racing experience is an ok racing game, even if it does feel rough around the edges. I am not sure if its 'finished' now or not, I just know it doesn't feel like it. I will say that this review is pretty terrible. I just can't seem to find any of the info I want to put out there. As of now you at least have my opinion.   As of this review: The game looks ok at first, and in all honesty I want to Like RaceRoom Racing Experience but it just feels so, so unfinished. At this point though, with the devs undergoing 'restructuring' the future does not look bright for RaceRoom Racing Experience.  The game in my opinion is not even finished enough to do a positive or negative review, at this time I cant recommend that you play/ get it, but I dont think you should write it off just yet.
9364	1	a	I'ts aight
9366	1	a	So many Dislikes... Thats why i came here to Dislike it! why causes this dislike? PAY-TO-WIN!
9368	1	a	Very good game to play can seem abit arcadish when you first start to play, Easy to make into your all time favorite Racing Game and would rather play this anytime rather than Grid 2   I would like them to give you the single race option from when you first get the game  Very good game  Well done SinBin Studios
9370	1	a	just use a steering wheel and you're gonna be ok if not.... gtfo
790	0	a	Raceroom experience was a very frustrating experience!  Update :- I have found a way to fix the main problem that I have with this game and that is to change traction control preset 0 from 0 to 100 in the car setup in the garage before a race (i.e. in practice or qualifying). I think what I was experiencing is called power on oversteer. Though I still cant believe that it should be anything like that bad in a real car :( Note this wont help you brake or go around a corner, it just means you wont spin off the track into the corner when you gently accelerate !  I cant believe the developers have made this game so inaccessable when all they need to do is change 1 variable and it would be 30000 percent more playable to people who try the game ! Btw I come at tihis as someone who generaly prefers more sim like games like gt legends, grid, dirt, test drive unlimited 2, nfs shift 2, race injection etc. But even with hundreds of experience on probably 20 different racing games I couldnt make it around a lap without it crashing from oversteer !   I still hesitiate to recommend this game because of the sheer anount of frustration this issue caused me  Here is my original review :-  Raceroom experience is a very frustrating experience!  This is mainly down to what I consider a fault in the physics model ! The frustrations are :- 1 (and this is the big 1) ) When accelerating out of a bend the car oversteers and crashes back into the bend it has come out of ! This is most noteable on raceroom raceway, on the corner at the start of the start finish straight.  The track goes around a corner and up a hill, yet the car just uncontrolably spins with oversteer back towards the corner if power is applied. No amount of opposite lock corrects it, and it doesnt feel like the back end is trying to overtake the front end due to too much power. It feels like its turning in a circle for no good reason. Grrr ! Though I have a feeling this is a common fault with a lot of so called sims. How many cars in the real world do you see spinning into the corner they have come out of ? This issue is probably more of a problem on raceroom raceway than most tracks. But that track in the standard yellow car (Canhard R52, sillhoutte series ?) sure does highlight it!  Btw I have a g25 wheel and pedals and a fast pc (gtx970 etc). So I dont think my problems are down to my setup. Also I have witnessed many many drivers having the same problems on that track, so its not just me. Though the experienced drivers do work around the problem.   2) If you do crash off, then the game takes 20 seconds to get going again. Either the car wont move at all or it just spins you into the opposite direction or you end up doing doughnuts. It will not spin and point in the right direction ! It doesnt matter if you are really subtle and gentle on the power or really heavy the result is the same ! Grrrr!  I think other than this the physics are very good, the sound is very good, the graphics are a slight improvement over race 07, but not as good as say need for speed or project cars. Oh and I think the actual online multiplayer mechanics are good, which probably makes it one of the best online racing games, sim or otherwise on the pc (if and for me this might be too much of an if :- If you can adapt your driving style to ignore what I consider to be faulty physics). I like the way you can test drive the cars before buying, though generally the content is too expensive. Particularly buying multiple items doesnt give enough of a discount.  Anyway, it would be a very good game, if it wasnt for what I consider to be a fault in one aspect of its physics model that makes it soooo frustrating :(
9372	1	a	Plays really well on my AMD E1-1500 w/HD Graphics (1.48GHz) 4GB RAM Loving it, it's really enjoyable! ^-^  FPS roughly 35-50

9378	1	a	One of those games that make you go, darn i really need a racing wheel
9380	1	a	terrible graphics
793	0	a	Server down. No Game. Dont make my mistake and give your money to sector 3!! Assetto Corsa is better and it works!!
9382	1	a	I am really enjoying this alot.  Had this on steam years ago but didn't actually play much and never bought any content that seems at the time rather highly priced. Sometime or another an update wrecked my FFB and I uninstalled and forgot about it.  Now about 2 years later I try it again.  It really is very nice and very immersive. Buying 1 pack from stream and then later much cheaper now when I buy ingame store. I guess a big part of that is content I now already own from buying that first pack, so in the end prices are really not too bad.  I am enjoying driving at Nordschleife with this sim much more than I ever did with either AC or Pcars. The combination of great sound, graphics, forcefeedback and overall feel really puts you in the driving mood.    The new update has a massive improvement to the AI. This just got a whole lot better
9384	1	a	Very good game overall, but I feel it could use some more content. The developers are constantly working on new cars, which is great, but I feel the Track count is very low. It needs more tracks. I don't know which tracks are in the plans of the developers, but hopefully, they'll have some more for releasing in the near future.
9386	1	a	YES ♥♥♥♥♥S BE ♥♥♥♥♥ING WHILE THEY SIT ON MY LAP AS I PUMP THEM woops i meant the pedal and i drive THEM woops again the car :) JKJK 69
9388	1	a	Impressive demo but I hate the IAP, free limited play model. Graphics, sound is superb. The interface is terrible and a little confusing so far. Can't see pictures of cars available for selection before a race. And the load times... TERRIBLE. And I'm running this using a 16GB NVIDIA GTX, SSD drives, with 32GB ram. I guess my $3500 laptop isn't fast enough for this game. It runs smooth but load times are unacceptable.
796	0	a	Microtransactions. Everywhere. Nope.
797	0	a	Why the ♥♥♥♥ 20 GB, for demo game ♥♥♥♥... 
798	0	a	Let me start by saying, first off, you have to be prepared to spend a lot of money if you want to play more than what seems like a 'DEMO' of the game. Second, I got a few issues with the physics when using a game pad. It is very twitchy even with light throttle on every car when you are not in 3rd gear or higher. I have been on race tracks and in real race cars. You can tell when you are getting close to the edge of the handling capabilities. This game seems to either give you massive understeer, then when you manage to make a corner, you got the twitching problem when trying to get power down out of the corners. I find myself having to be in one or two gears higher than I should be just to keep control of the physics at the lower speeds. Having a spedometer when you are outside of the car would help also. The only way you can get a speedometer or tachometer is to have your view from inside the car.
9390	1	a	Very nice free game! This is so cool, and the DLC are actually have a nice price too, not so expensive, and you also get some cards for free that are already included, nice game!
799	0	a	Terrible controller settings, no novice support, nobody is playing, not free at all, everything costs money, even tracks. terrible game
800	0	a	Wouldn't even launch.  Regardless of how good the game is once you start racing (Should you get there) this game needs an overhaul of it's menu. The menus are all online, slow, massive white screens, glitchy and give error messages. I don't have a terrible PC, and this game wouldn't load at all. I got an error message at every stage.  TL;DR Its not worth the 20gbs, your time or your effort.
9392	1	a	this game sucks so ♥♥♥♥ing bad that its good
9394	1	a	Sorry, but this game really sucks. Wanted to like it but to confusing. Want a real racing game.
9396	1	a	I loved this game...  I need more time to get to grips with it.
9398	1	a	Getting the game to properly recognize my controller and map it properly was too difficult. UI needs a major overhaul to make navigation easier; too many UI gimics and not enough function.
9400	1	a	Even at this BETA stage, I recommend it. Superb graphics, immersive feel. Hold off on DTM Experience until SimBin provides sliders to adjust AI. Right now, as of this date, AI is not very adaptive and is just too easy. As well, the game needs more detail as a simulation. I want to know what my tire temps are so that I can know how to set up my suspension etc etc.
9402	1	a	It takes a little dedication to get used to the game. The handling is sometimes a little quirky, especially when new to the game. Though, when figuring out how the steering exactly works, and lap times are going down, the game really stimulates you to continue - whether on the same track, in the same car, or in the same competition.  I didn't buy any vRP (currency) yet, so I haven't bought any new cars or tracks, but already, I managed to spend over 20 hours into the game. And I don't play games that much, so for me, that's a lot ;)  If racing is really something you enjoy, I would recommend you check it out. Probably, a lot of you will ragequit out, because the handling is a thing to get used to. However, with a little bit of practice, even the 2 free tracks are good to drive on, and even when experienced, those tracks are great fun, and still full of challenge.  Nevertheless, if racing is not your type of game, this might not appeal to you fully.

9408	1	a	really good graphics but crash gravity is weird
9410	1	a	A very realistic speed demon simulator. Go from 0 to 60 in seconds, and most important, win the race.
802	0	a	♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥
9412	1	a	IN SHORT THE GAME IS ACTULLY BETTER NOT TO BE CALLED A F2P ITS MORE LIKE TRY OUT THE GAME WE WILL THROW IN A FEW CARS AND TRACKS FOR FREE IF U LIKE IT BUY MORE CARS. DONT GET ME WRONG THE GAME IS AWEEEESOME ITS MORE REALISTIC THAN FORZA BUT DOESNT HAVE THAT SAME PASSION IT OVERALL TRY IT OUT!
9414	1	a	Very fun. Much speed. Much over 'stickered' car. Old joke. Wow. 10/10 -IGN Would press up again.
9416	1	a	when ever i try to play it gives me a black screen and i cant do anythig but restart my computer
9418	1	a	but i have a mac and i downloaded steam windows on it but i just cant get it working but on youtube it looks awsome 
9420	1	a	I'm an avid sim-racer and a national karting racer so let's just get straight to the point :  + Graphics is good for a free game + Online TA competition that leads to prizes + A lot of variety of cars  - Microtransactions (too pricey) - Multiplayer seems lonely. - Physics a bit arcadish
803	0	a	The Game looks great! The tracks and cars are detailed. However, the controls are incredibly difficult to setup, if it detects your input. I used a Xbox One controller and could not control the vehicle at all. It says it's free, but you have the option to pick three cars on three tracks, then you have to pay an exorbitant amount for the rest of the game, much more than a AAA game would be. If you're goinmg to make a free game, make it free. If you're going to make a game that costs money, then make it cost money, but don't lure people in with the facade of free only to try to charge them more moeny than Fallout 4 or GTA V costs!
9422	1	a	Awesome free racing game, multiplayer would be nicer if there were more people playing. Overall this is a nice game. I recommend playing it if you like realistic race games.  
9424	1	a	Race for free, race for pay, race for fun, sym race for everybody
9426	1	a	A better name would be SOAP, 'cause apperently that's what you're tires are made of. 10/10 taking turns in the 1st gear works great.
9428	1	a	i like the game but i dont understand the title 
805	0	a	♥♥♥♥ing piece of ♥♥♥♥
9430	1	a	Nice game
9432	1	a	I reccommend this game the paid content is far better than the free cars and 1/2 prices cars u can get cars and track really cheap at the moment..  Also make sure the game works b4 u put money into it.. check the forums something may fix an isssue u have...  also a common problem the 503 error not able to connect should hopefully be fixed in upcomming itergration patch with steam so u dont need a seperate log in ..    going to my documents games and deleted the simbin fold fixed my log in problem which i think was caused by a computer crash while game was running .. also one of the free tracks is pretty good .. and a hill climb free track .. and u can test drive cars b4 u buy them for a couple of laps.. so not like iracing u have to buy and hope ... this is a lot cheaper and more fun in my opinion tho i still use the iracing for other stuff like ovals.. nascar ...  this has wtcc which iracing doesnt and a lot more gt3 cars (13) ... plus the dtm series
813	0	a	So many better options out there. Stupid A'I', bad netcode, ripoff payment system, dated.
814	0	a	Costs money to get anything good... :/ Description overrates the game, but it's free, so check it out and see what I mean. :P
815	0	a	Don't bother
816	0	a	10/10 jk this game is cancer.
817	0	a	loo0000ng loading time.. *with millions of Os. uninstall directly..
818	0	a	this game is terrible.
819	0	a	This game crashes every 20-40 minutes for me (i5-4670K and GTX 760). Until they fix that I'm not paying for anything. The handling of the cars seems really good once you get the steering wheel settings sorted out. There's no single-player vs. the AI or multiplayer right now, you just drive around a track by yourself and it shows you how your times compare to other people's. The menus are the most ridiculously confusing thing I've ever seen too.  If they fix the crashing problem and add actual racing to the game, I'll be happy to get the $40 DLC. But until then it's a no go.
820	0	a	Totally fake and unrealistic car behavior, physics, sound and graphics. Maybe not as bad as iracing, where it doesn't matter how fast you drive it always feels the same, but bad enough that you have to even in a demo purchase cars and tracks. Just crap all around and as a perfectionist, I have to say that nothing so far competes or compares to F1 2013 in realism, physics, graphics and sound !!!
821	0	a	loading times suck. Everything has to load it would seem. Replays especially
822	0	a	Game wont let me register to even play it so as of now this thing blows
823	0	a	This is game ist not mine.  I think the gameplay is ♥♥♥♥. Sry about that.
824	0	a	I'll start off my review by sharing an overall feeling and then list some pros' and cons' afterwards. Overall I would not recommend this game for a few reasons such as the cost modelling, undeveloped multiplayer and very poor customer support. Such a shame because this game had such promise only to fall flat on its' face.  Pros' - Decent, not great, selection of cars especially packs like DTM and ADAC GT Masters.  - Industry benchmark for sounds which intensifies the immersion.  - Very few flaws visually, but not quite to Assetto Corsa / Project Cars standards.  - Decent selection of tracks with more content on the way.  -Very few issues I had with wheel connectivity and settings right out of the gate.  Cons' - Cost modelling system similar to IRacing , much cheaper than IRacing but also none of the benefits.  - Multiplayer leaves something to be desired and they say as much upfront so think of it as early access.  - Online game only so don't expect to play the game if their servers are down.  - My biggest con = terrible customer support when things go wrong. To elaborate, approx. 2 weeks ago their main server and content server crashed, the game was unplayable and many like myself had paid content disappear for which i was not reimbursed with the content or given a refund. In fact, as of this writing I have yet to receive a reply to 2 support / ticket claims and one e-mail. With price modelling like this, you'd think they would be more interested than normal to help their customer base. This is not the SIMBIN that you used to know. I highly recommend you pick up GSC instead and save your money and save yourself a headache !!!
825	0	a	This seems like a good take on a racing simulator. But it lacks a lot.  First, the free content of the game is limited and will bore you fast (1 track, 2 cars), I feel like we could have had a bit more, even if we get free testdrives of other cars on weekends. Also there is no multiplayer apart for laptimes and that makes it just you on the same track trying to get better times.  Graphicwise and simulation was it is great, nice graphics and it gives a realistic handling.   The ingame purchases are a bit expensive for what I'd aim for, but they are good and if you can afford it really take the game further.  It's free to play, so It's a goodie to have but overal it isn't quite finished yet.
826	0	a	I literraly fell asleep to this.
827	0	a	Disappointed. Game wouldnt start. Log shows playing time but never even got to start grid.
828	0	a	If it wasn't for the Free2Play system the game would have my recommendation  F2Play/10
829	0	a	Great i got the game, now how do i turn the car the only thing i can do is bump into walls
830	0	a	You need to buy all cars you want to play with. Free???
831	0	a	just sits there showing foggy cars, never loads to show the menus even after an hour
832	0	a	Overly complicated with way too many ingame purcases, I would rather just pay for the game. It is very difficult to get into, go by Grid instead. (This game is not worth the download time).
833	0	a	
834	0	a	It's very hard to control the car even not in any corner. I will not recommend this game unless you seeking for the real life experience AND have appropriate equipment such as a steering wheel.

9438	1	a	love this game! Needs to be ported to Xbox 360, Xbox one, Ps3, and Ps4! Seriously. would beat GT Sport and Asseto Corsa.
9440	1	a	By far the best racing simulator on steam in terms of physics and driving feeling. Slightly inferior graphics than PC or AC, because it focus on racing realism: excellent tyres and aero model, for example. Lots of FF options to finetune. Definitely a must have racing game.

9448	1	a	difflicult gameplay :(  Nice Graphics :)
890	0	a	Well... No. At this (as they say) early state of development there are many reasons to just say 'no' to this game. I played a whole lot of racing games and racing sims and still I'm not fully aware where to put it Raceroom Racing Experience in. Sometimes, driving in R3E feels reasonably realistic, sometimes it's ridicoulusly arcade-ish.   Let's have a list of good aspects of R3E; There is a great AI, which often fights and struggles the same way you do. I don't want to say that they're completely flawless, hell no, but compared to other racing games, the AI in R3E is damn good.  The tracks come in a very polished manner and for me it was a pleasure to see such detailed tracks, full of life. Codemasters still does a better job in this but well, you can't be good at everything, right?   Also the cars look nice - not great, but nice. It's pretty hard to say when it is 'enough' regarding details, because theoretically it's never enough if you want to simulate things. But sure there are restrictions in terms of hardware resources. And it's 'free' to play, so they want to reach a big audience of course.  All along the words 'free to play' is the biggest flaw in here. When you first download the game, there are waiting 2 cars in your garage on 2 tracks, with 3 and 2 versions of it. Of the the tracks is a R3E Fantasy track, which - don't get me wrong - is damn good. Sector 3 Entertainment offers a test-drive in every car you may want to drive, at least. But let's face it - if you want to have a full garage, you're about to pay at least 120€, which is too damn high, considering that the cars are not even realistically balanced or even physically correct - yes, they are nice, but nice doesn't want me to pay that much money.   I purchased the ADAC GT Masters 2014 Package, the Hillclimb Package, as well as the track Bathurst and the Ruf GTRS12 (basically a Porsche 997 GT3). Hell yeah it was worth it, I had some fun, especially on Bathurst, and with some of the GT Masters tracks and cars... But the game still feels incomplete, everywhere pops up a 'BUY NOW', 'BUY NOW', 'ON SALE', 'ON SALE', advertisement everywhere - incredibly annoying.   I don't think that they ever change this, so this alone is a reason to give it a 'no'... On top of that comes the questionable physics and behaviour of some cars and the lack of settings of track conditions.  Oh and it was a pain in the ♥♥♥♥ to get my Force Feedback into a playable state, although it fully supports my Logitec Driving Force GT (I know, it's far away from being the best, thanks! :D ), which to me was a antipathic moment, also...  Go download the thing and try it yourself, but invest some hours before you buy something.
891	0	a	Awful company. Overpriced garbage. Dumb business model. Poor game.  Even the zombie apocalypse couldn't bring this game's multiplayer to life.  It's dead. Avoid. Look at Assetto Corsa, Project cars or Stock car extreme instead.
892	0	a	I'm one of the Alpha Testers of the game and no, I don't recommend the game. Not because of Alpha problems which are expected from all games, but the engine is not optimised. I get a fair bit of lag with NVIDIA-610M at the Lowest possible graphics. Which are pea soup quality. Now I don't really have problems with fairly new games, and no problem with the old games when it comes to performance. This is the first negative.  Second is, I don't think game mechanics are realistic. Probably depends on the person, but I didn't like them. A.I. is not good as expected from Alpha and CB, it can be easily patched.  Rest assured, if you play it on easy difficulties and have a high end machine, you will enjoy the game. Rest? I'm sorry.
893	0	a	This has to be the worst racing game ive ever played and i played alot of them. steering is the problem. car wont go in a straight line with or without accelerating. turn slightly and the car keeps going that direction. its like the track rods are loose on the car . ive tried control pad and steering wheel. no matter what i do i cant get it to full 900degrees steering stuck at 200 and the input from my steering wheel doesnt match the input ingame. dont get me started on the force feedback there is none the wheel just constantly vibrates.  plus play for free my ♥♥♥♥ you would get more in a demo. stay clear from this game.
894	0	a	Unrealistic physics, laggy, 97% of the cars you have to buy. Long loading times even in single player.
895	0	a	I was hoping on passing the time between Forza Horizon and Forza 5 but I played this game once and it was a mess. Horrible game. It's not even worth the price tag, free. They should be paying me to play this piece of garbage.
896	0	a	Cars handle horridly and sound bad with it. Wait till it gets better.
897	0	a	This game has no feedback whatsoever. R3E is the worst simulator out there, don't be scammed like the creators of this thing want you to be.
898	0	a	Do game companies not understand, making people pay for a full game, not only, will bring them money, but it will also strengthen their fanbase, I love the devs, but they made a poor choice with the marketing for this game, it's not F2P, it's Pay4Fun, and if a game is like that, might as well pay full price for a game. If you have 100's of dollars to spend on it go ahead, but I just personally don't want to, and for me, the physics on this specific game aren't even that good, reletively speaking to games like Assetto Corsa, rFactor, and Project cars, which have pretty solid physics engines (rFactor barely xD).
899	0	a	I was hoping on passing the time between Forza Horizon and Forza 5 but I played this game once and it was a mess. Horrible game. It's not even worth the price tag, free. They should be paying me to play this piece of garbage.
900	0	a	I have never played a racing game with the word 'sim' in it, that is so bad.Traction, braking, and steering/handling physics are terrible. Cars seem to always steer right for some reason, and the handbrake doesnt work. Then there is the elephant in the room. Lack of content. 6 tracksand 10 cars? come on. to have to pay ridiculous money for new tracks and cars, i makes this already below par game so much more unappealing. -4/10
901	0	a	Game is BS, UI is ♥♥♥♥, controlls are ♥♥♥♥, and GFX are ♥♥♥♥.
902	0	a	Pretty much just a waste of 20+ gigs of space. Any free racing game is better than this so-called 'simulator.' Steering wheel implementation is pathetic compared to any modern game, free or not. Save yourself the download and pass over this one.
903	0	a	it is basically a free trial, just check it out for yourself. if you dont mind the 16 GB download.  the AI sucks. it has 2 tracks and 2 cars for free, the rest you pay in DLC. Physics don't seem that bad, but the Game overall feels like Alpha version. not recomended. if you have the money to buy all the carp they sell you, if you happen to like the game, you should try it anyways. base model is free after all.
904	0	a	Free to play my a**! You get like 3 cars and 3 tracks and that's about. For anything more, you need to pay lots of money. At least start selling the game for 60 euros with everything included. Until then, this game is not recommended by me!
905	0	a	RaceRoom Racing Experience is what the title tells you, a Racing Experience, that is what I thought, until I downloaded this game. Basically this game is a Racing game, like all the other thousands of Racing games but this one is different,  IT'S FREE TO PLAY!   (Now isn't that something you dont see everyday...)    Anyway! Back to the Review! Now the first thing I'm gonna jump right into is the  AI . So basically the AI is exactly like you in this game,  except 20x better.  They are even better at turning in this game, 'Turning? Isn't turning ment to be the easiest thing in the whole game?'  Now thats what I thought when I downloaded the game too, until I played a match of Singleplayer, this also brings us to our second thing I want to talk to you about, the turning, yes, the turning. Basically the turning is terrible, and I mean  TERRIBLE . Alright so you want to take this basic turn at a slight fast speed?  WELL NOPE ! You are basically screwed. The turning is so bad, I don't know if it's meant to make it feel realistic or something, but it is still terrible the turning. The third and last thing I have to  turtore  tell you is how all cars are... you guessed it...  Manual...  It makes me cringe just waiting for it to change each several gear to reverse, I swear it takes 5  slow  seconds to reverse... WHY? This is a  Racing Game , NOT A, 'Take A Driving Test for your License,'  GAME! Unbelivable. Well that's it! Thank's for wasting 1 minute of your life reading this review on this awful game! I swear the graphics don't look as good as the trailer shows them.
906	0	a	Absolute ♥♥♥♥ing waste of time! 9.1Gb size with my slow ♥♥♥ internet to find that I need atleast $100 to buy cars and tracks. 
907	0	a	I went into this game expecting great things, having loved Race 07 as it was my introduction into pc sim racing. played the game, as a racer its pretty good, but compared to the competition, Assetto Corsa, Project CARS, hell even Race 07, it just isnt good value for money if you want to buy more cars/tracks, to buy 3 cars and a track costs about £10, if you want to buy every car, track and livery you are looking at well over £100. and even if this was the best racing game ever made, with the best physics, graphics and features, it would not be worth that. if you want to spend that much on a racing game i would recommend a monthly subscription to iRacing or rFactor 2 which will certainly cover you in that regard. For a utter beginner into pc sim, it is not to bad, but for everyone else this will simply drain your wallet with not enough reward, not compared to its rivals. I wish they made GTR 3 instead.
908	0	a	This might be the only time to actually waste money on this game considering the 70% off. Otherwise, the amount of money spent on this game just to collect cars and tracks is ridiculous for what you end up with compared to their older titles and hate to through in consoles, but FM and GT games, then not to mention the upcoming Project Cars which I'm part of and is in my opinion stunning and love the the work those guys are putting into their new game (Project Cars).

910	0	a	Worst optimized racing game i have ever played. i can't play it on high setting but my pc is higher then recommended.Low settings looks ♥♥♥♥♥♥(like ur playing a game in 2000). Multiplayer is full of kids who like to drive cars like GTA.In first corner there is no chance to still going unless u were started in first 5.  PROS + +Free +Multiplayer +Physics are not bad +Good forcefeedback  CONS- -Shiffy racing experience -Optimization -U have less then 10 cars and the other cars are locked until u buy them -Don't try to play it with a keyboard.(I tried both keyboard and g27) If u want some racing experience and if u going to pay some money go buy iracing(u can get it free for 3 months).
911	0	a	This is a story of a lot of missed potential. The controls are nice, the visuals are nice, and the cars feel very weighty and responsive. But, that's about the end of my compliments.  Why this is labeled as 'Free To Play' is beyond me. you get one, maybe two cars and two tracks for free. literally everything else you have to pay for. The tracks that they show off on the front page? Yeah, you have to buy all of those individually. I don't call that free to play, I call that a demo. If it was labelled as a demo and that the full game had to be bought, it'd be a different review. But, since they tried to pass it off as a free to play game that had loads of content, only to mock the person when they get in with entire screens and sections as paid DLCs, it feels like a massive case of false advertising.   And the Driving assists, oh god the driving assists. they come down like a bag of bricks and you can't turn them off. I spent a good half hour searching for a way to turn off the auto-braking, because it made my car come to what I can only describe as a complete stop around even a small corner.  unless you have money and patience, I say stick to the competitors, because this is a blatant money-grab.
912	0	a	worst gui ive ever experienced in a game, downloaded 9gb then uninstalled straight away a ♥♥♥♥ poor game. Only positive is that it was free so cant complain about the price but everything else not so much...  requiring you to spend money to unlock cars, free 2 play rubbish!!!!!!  editing the controls should be easy, not impossible to find the menu.
913	0	a	It's been a couple of years now since I forked out real world money for a handful of tracks and cars for this game. Still there is no racing to be found either online or offline outside of the DTM 'dlc'. The name of the game is a lie.  Still just time attack modes and a token practice mode against AI.  The driving experience itself doesn't feel as good as other games from the developer's illustrious past and the immersion provided by the sound and graphics is merely passable. If you're only using the base content, then it's worth a go to enter the competitions and work your way up the leaderboards, but if you intend on splashing out some cash, there are mch better options available. I'm a keen sim racer and try out all the different sims that come on the market but can't recommend spending money on this.
914	0	a	Pretty nice graphics, don't mind the microtransactions but I refuse to spend money until they fix the AI. The AI will just slam your car with blatant disregard and, I'm sure it's all in my head, but it feels like when they hit me I go flying and skid out. When I hit them basically nothing happens and they can maintain control no problem.  If they fix the AI I'd buy Laguna Seca, a few cars, and I'd race that track till my fingers bleed.
915	0	a	Graphics not the best. Gameplay and controls are just a joke - Teribble. 95% of cars and maps have to be bought (of course all the good cars and maps). Not worth downloading.
916	0	a	race room expirence more like race room bad experience why? 1 sining in was like filling out a census form  2 comfirmation email took 1 hour 3 does not work  4 very limted content
9450	1	a	Awesome game! But keyboard sucks in this game, better buy a controller :)
9452	1	a	After playing this game for about 20 minutes or so I ended up just turning it off. This game feels like you need a high end racing wheel. Playing with a name brand game pad, the controles either seemed to simplified, or non existant. That being said, hte graphics are amazing. I play on low settings and it looks better than i could have imagined. Some of the tracks are ones that I played in other games so it has a great famiar appeal to it, Def recommend for players looking for more of a drving sim than a racing game.
962	0	a	Still no multiplayer. I'm not waiting anymore. Goodbye
963	0	a	this game is boring im trlling you
964	0	a	Pretty decent for a free game no Multiplayer like Autoclub Revolution. It's basically the same game but has Multiplayer in it as well. I would recomment this game if it had Multiplayer not hot laps or whatever these idiots call it and other racing sims follow.
965	0	a	♥♥♥♥ this piece of ♥♥♥♥. You can't even ♥♥♥♥ing reverse it's so stupid. Waste of time.
966	0	a	keeps crashing everytime i try to play it
967	0	a	Didn't get any feeling at all with this game at all. I suppose you need a steering wheel to be able to enjoy it. And free to play? Yeah right... in singler player only. If you want to play online you need to hand out €30+ wich I didnt know beforehand.. If it would have a better feeling to it I would certainly be willing to pay for it, and I would apprechiate if that information was handed to me before I downloaded it and registered.. I think I'll just hang back a while and wait for a better option.
968	0	a	Because of Assetto Corsa, I was very optimistic about indie racing simulators, and this game was free, so I thought I'd try it out. It turns out, it's merely a freemium game, with full-on microtransactions, and you can't do anything in the game besides doing practice on one track with one car without paying money. It's essentially the Real Racing 3 of computers, except Real Racing 3 allows you to progress through the game without microtransactions and offers much more without paying a cent. Let's talk about the game itself. The physics kinda work, but the car feels slippery, much like a bar of soap, and the graphics are representative of a phone game-no, not even, Real Racing 3 looks much better. Especially the interior view of the car is very messy and poorly textured at best. Is it a bad game? Not necessarily, I'm guessing the game is merely developing, but I feel that it is not worth playing let alone spending money on at this state. Definitely get Assetto Corsa instead, it looks great even in alpha state and it looks like the developers really care rather than this pay-to-have-fun affair. Or, if you're broke and need a free racing game, I'd recommend Trackmania Nations Forever, which has course creators and frantic online multiplayer, or even the demo of GRID 2, which has online multiplayer.
969	0	a	RRRE lures you in with a premise of the Free2Play game model where there is actual fun to be had for free and you will not have to spend tonnes of money on every single piece of content.  Unfortunately, that is the case for RRRE, which cleverly uses the trademarked 'FREE2RACE' term, which means yes, you can race for free, but barely.  RRRE is not as good of a simulator as previous Simbin titles, meaning that other similar alternatives like Simraceway and iRacing will be the way to go now for the old Race07 crowd.  Do not spend money on this game if you're expecting old Simbin quality.
970	0	a	So many micro transactions
971	0	a	Still no multiplayer. I'm not waiting anymore. Goodbye
972	0	a	this game is boring im trlling you
973	0	a	P.O.S. nuff' said. seriously though, it gives you Single player, no racing with friends, unless of course you buy it, but wait thats not all! you also need to buy more tracks other than the TWO they give you, unless of course, you don't mind the game getting stale within a few races. cars? of course they have a couple, see that sweet ride over there you want? BAM! transaction. im surprised they don't try to sell individual wheels to you as well.
974	0	a	Don't play this unless you really want to spend money on it. Since FREE players only have 1 track and 1 car to race with...
975	0	a	This is a horrible game. The driving experience is not a good one. Dont download this game!!!!!!
976	0	a	Very limited free game, although the in game driving is actually good the free version is so limited it has put me off playing

985	0	a	'Good' graphics, sounds amazing and had some good points about it here and there, but that's about it. It's a good racing simulation, with somewhat realistic effects and physics, but it's not top-notch like full retail games out there.   The catch here is it's being announced as a 'free to play' game, when obviously, it's not. You can download and test it for free, on one track, on one car, beyond that, you WILL have to pay for anything else, and i mean PAY it with your real money. I didn't even went to see how the currency on this is, all i can say is it's NOT worth it. Paying for EVERYTHING in (theorically) a free to play game is not ok.   You can't try the tracks, you can't try the cars, all you can do is PAY, and then PAY some more. It's not a F2P, it's a demo for a possibly good game, but the urge to try it fades fastly, when you have to be a 'wallet driver'.
986	0	a	hard to hand vehicle, whats you to spend tons of cash for every thing in game
987	0	a	Should be called 'Uninstall Simlulator 2015'

989	0	a	Pay to win trash.
990	0	a	sort out your game , keeps bloody crashing , beyond a joke now neo this and that
991	0	a	This game created a new concept, Free to play-&gt; Pay to Play-&gt; Pay some more to be able to enjoy it -&gt; Pay some more again to win -&gt; skip all previous steps and delete game. Period.  This game could be great if the developers could figure out if they want to make a premium game or a free to play game. Choose one, it is not that hard.
9454	1	a	This game has a kinda mix of Project Cars and Forza Motoersport 4. For a Realistic-Racing game, I recommend it. For a Racing game, I don't. It just it isn't an open-world experience that I thought. I love the Forza series, iRacing and Project Cars, but this game is more of a non-casual racing game. In my opinion I give it a 7.1/10 for Low-End Performence and Game wise.
995	0	a	------------------------ Updated Review February 25, 2015 ------------------------ Well, I decided to spend a little more time on RaceRoom Racing Experience, and admittedly, it is a lot better than when I tried it last year. I've been able to complete single player AI racing on two tracks, and I can practice on three tracks. The selection of cars is a little better for being free, but still not enough to really keep you entertained.  I didn't try the online portion of this, partially because I'm pretty bad at this game (I'm more used to Forza and GT) and partially because most people playing online are using DLC that you need to purchase.  This game definitely has great physics, and I'll probably give it another shot using my G27 instead of my Xbox 360 controller. Unfortunately, I still can't recommend it. You can pay for a full game like pCARS or Assetto Corsa and receive a lot more content than RaceRoom can deliver in its DLC packs (from what I'm reading).  ------------------------ Old Review May 26, 2014 ------------------------ During the small amount of time I've had playing this, I honestly don't think this is a free-to-play game. Admittedly, this game feels and plays more like a demo than F2P.  Only being able to play hot-lap modes, with one track (a few variants of that one track, but still one location), and very few cars makes this game feel like a joke when advertised as free-to-play.  While the gameplay is decent enough, I feel that the control of the cars could be a little better. Using a G27, I feel as if I can't seem to turn sharp enough to get through some corners unless I slow down to rediculously slow speeds, and that's only using 200 degrees of the wheel. As a comparison, on Assetto Corsa I can pull decent turns during the curves, and that's using the full 900 degrees of the wheel.  Unfortunately, I can't recommend this. For your simulation fix, I think you'd be better off currently purchasing Assetto Corsa.
996	0	a	Every time I hit register it goes to micrasoft word for some reason and the link is not working. How can I fix that?
997	0	a	You'll need money to play this game with pleasure(cars, maps,...)
998	0	a	...
999	0	a	Unimpressed with it so far. There just hasn't been enough done with this game to keep me interested at this point. After having SimBin games before this is really just the same feel with no multiplayer or career. We need racing sims to be complete upon release and not just time trials. They also need to have a racer vs AI single player career mode that moves you up through the ranks along side the multiplayer.   I had high hopes that by now more was don after seeing it a year ago. Just disappointed with it and looking forward to Project Cars to see what they do.
1000	0	a	DO NOT BUY there is no controler support even thos they claim there is cant remap any keys to do anything I can turn left and thats it I can sit there turning left cant move nothing took 4 days to even beable to load the game
1001	0	a	.
1002	0	a	this game would be great if it had mulitplayer.. or more then a single track and car to use. 90% of this game is micro transactions. everything costs money and even while i played with the only car you get for free on the only free track i still wasnt very impressed. the game is difficult to use and the menu screens are a wierd circle design which looked cool but made it very hard to read anything on the bottom because it was placed upside down. by the time you spent enough money to make this game worth playing yiu would have been able to get a much better racing simulator. if you want a racing game that wont break the bank i reccomend Race07 it is under 5 dollers on steam. its a much better value.
1003	0	a	This game really is a piece of crap, take too long to load, the steering wheel does not work, just one car and a track, I definitely do not recommend it.
1004	0	a	Unimpressed with it so far. There just hasn't been enough done with this game to keep me interested at this point. After having SimBin games before this is really just the same feel with no multiplayer or career. We need racing sims to be complete upon release and not just time trials. They also need to have a racer vs AI single player career mode that moves you up through the ranks along side the multiplayer.   I had high hopes that by now more was don after seeing it a year ago. Just disappointed with it and looking forward to Project Cars to see what they do.
1005	0	a	DO NOT BUY there is no controler support even thos they claim there is cant remap any keys to do anything I can turn left and thats it I can sit there turning left cant move nothing took 4 days to even beable to load the game

1010	0	a	When I downloaded this game, I got an alert from AVAST! saying it had malware. Also, it won't boot because it says it needs steam to be running to play (which it is)
9456	1	a	It supports racing wheels i tested it with logitech g27.Worked fine but controls are maby too sensitive.
1042	0	a	sort out your game , keeps bloody crashing , beyond a joke now neo this and that
1043	0	a	This game created a new concept, Free to play-&gt; Pay to Play-&gt; Pay some more to be able to enjoy it -&gt; Pay some more again to win -&gt; skip all previous steps and delete game. Period.  This game could be great if the developers could figure out if they want to make a premium game or a free to play game. Choose one, it is not that hard.
1044	0	a	Sorry, but no. The UI is all over the place--it is easy to tell that it was designed for a steering wheel, but why does the main menu look like a messy CS:GO buy menu?, the game's overall atmosphere, the levels and lack of sound effects (other than the exagerated car noises)--makes the game feel lonely and soulless--even the in-game messages feel robotic. and remind me of The Office when Dwight makes a birthday banner that simply reads, 'It is your birthday.', and finally the fact that any other car or track other than the one they give you is prompted with a overlay to purchase in-game funds make this game feel like a cash grab. Sad.
1045	0	a	cant even get the activation code in my eamail, they even have problems sending email to the users
1046	0	a	Holy crap only a few cars and only 1 track I believe. And mostly you buy stuff. Dont waste your time with this game
1047	0	a	The Graphics are horrid 
1048	0	a	Like ♥♥♥♥.all must pay. but the sound in nice
1049	0	a	I.....I don't know where to begin. First it lags. I've got 4 GB RAM and it lags at the most important moments in the race. I tried everything. Game Booster, restarting the PC, everything. Second, the AI sucks. Those guys are crashing you and they're not even trying to avoid you. The game would be super cool if it wouldn't lag, that's for sure. AI is not a problem, just sometimes. So try you guys to solve the lag problem and maybe I will change my review about this game.
1050	0	a	DISCLAIMER: I DO reconmend this game if you are using a single screen setup.  I have been a huge fan of the SimBin PC games through the years, and R3E definitely has the feel that I like and a great roster of cars and tracks. I am not a fan of the pricing scheme they've got set up for it however... Also, if you have triple screens, don't even bother unless you want to play with distorted fish eye effect. They won't bother to add multi-view like every other decent sim. Maybe one day I'll be able to enjoy this game the way i'd like to.
1051	0	a	I downloaded this game with the hope that it would be a decent play. After dicking about registering with far too much information, I managed to navigate the horrific menu and get into game. I was then greeted with a lovely CTD, no problem, I'll check my drivers and try again. After several attempts and a bit of research I tried running in windowed mode, which worked! I finally get in game and then the real disappointment set in, the handling is terrible, the physics (what physics) are broken and it just doesn't feel right; you shouldn't have to pretty much switch the enging off to negotiate a slight bend in the road. Even using a controller, it appears that the controls are pretty much off or flat out, which brings me to my next point. This game just isn't optimised for controller use, seriously, controlling a cursor with a stick just shouldnt' even be considered by any devs any more.   Other people seem to be complaining about the content. I haven't had the patience to fully explore it yet, although I will keep it installed and give it another chance on another day.
1052	0	a	controls are terrible and its realy hard to figure out what to do
1053	0	a	Couldn't even play the game  'can't launch RRRE_legacy.exe'
1054	0	a	The game isnt very good, the steering wheel only does a 90 degree turn and as a result the steering is to twitchy. Also the cars are really expensive and if you want a different skin you have to buy them. I would rather save up and buy Assetto Corsa(which is what I have done)off Steam, it is much better and the cars are free.
1055	0	a	Its P2W, i dont recomend
1056	0	a	Worst game in the world for racing , the steering is really bad you cant even drive the car. Dont bother !!!1
1057	0	a	good thing its free, your car slows down before turns even if you dont want it too, it nearly stops for no reason, also if you barely turn it completly spins you out
1058	0	a	this game is absolute crap ive had mobile games for free better than this
1059	0	a	welcome to warm butter on melting ice simulator! where, unless you have a million ♥♥♥♥ing pounds to spend on racing simulator full experience controls, you 'drift' into every ♥♥♥♥ing thing in the game. the controls for mouse and keyboard are so bad that i couldn't evenmove untill i changed the controls. even the control settings are ♥♥♥♥, you have to double click what you want to change and then click one of the buttons it actually recognises: all mouse buttons excluded. good thing this peice of ♥♥♥♥ is free, because if i had to spend £15 on this then i might have to accidentally slip and fall on to a ♥♥♥♥ing wall of chainsaws multiple times. (dont question that) the graphics might be ok; i wouldn't know. because it takes a ♥♥♥♥ing supercomputer to run decent graphics. if you have a super computer and/or full experience racing controls, then this game may be for you! if not, i advise you not to waste your time. TLDR: if you have a computer layout alike to normal humans, DONT. if you are a millionare with everything, on your own head be it.
1060	0	a	Never recieved the activation email ... NEVAH!  10/10 would wait again
1061	0	a	laggy as hell to say the least on a high end gaming machine and not much content unless you PAY for everything in the game useless for extreme racing gamers but ok if your bored crapless
1062	0	a	This game is stupid dont have thurstmaster wheel setup... I have a Thrustmaster Ferrari 458 Italia and doesnt work. So this just sucks... dont waiste time downloading 16 gb of this crap...

1066	0	a	Never more. 10Gb for 3 cars and 2 tracks wtf ? and the hardling .... cars looks like from paper
1067	0	a	The controls are horrible. Its too hard to enjoy from the start.
1068	0	a	I should apologize to my past self for downloading this.
1069	0	a	You have to pay for EVERYTHING... like only 4 cars are avalible to you for free but EVERYTHING IS LOCKED, MAPS, CARS, EVERYTHING IS PAY. I really wish that there was a way of actualy controling the car as well. Everything is waaay to touchy. And you will spin out every time. Also I really wish that you could earn cars or maps without paying, EARN! Anyways thats pretty much what I have to say about this game.
1070	0	a	It would be nice if you can play and not stuck in a loading screen.
1071	0	a	The graphic's suck and the game play is terrible i dont recommend this.
1072	0	a	Subpar racing sim
1073	0	a	this game has great potential, but the physics make no sense, i dont touch the steering at all and i start swerving left and right, i turn a little bit to the right and i spin out at 20 mph. there is NO WAY to control your car, and the fact that almost all the car models are locked and you have to buy them is kinda dumb.
1074	0	a	More like Racingroom paying experience!
9458	1	a	Nice but to expensive for a free game
1080	0	a	Feels too easy to drive compared to other sims I've tried. It's like some kind of traction help was on all the time even on the most realistic settings.
9460	1	a	Haven't played yet! Hope there are dodges!
1081	0	a	i counlldnt even go to the game all it was shown was the withe screen with cars
1082	0	a	Omg This game is ♥♥♥♥!
1083	0	a	So dissapointed! I try to disable auto clutch and it doesn't work... Where is my freedom! I literally have no control over the braking at corners and it is extremely annoying!
1084	0	a	It's a good game and all, but the startup GUI is nasty and everything is a HUGE learning curve and if you want a Forza game on the PC for free, this works, I guess...
1085	0	a	It would be really nice if the game, you know, came with all of the content. It would be even better if it didn't crash whenever you try to start a race. But other than the fact that it is basically unplayable, I'm sure it would be a fun game. Sorry, but it's a no from me.
9462	1	a	Is this a simulator game???

1268	0	a	This seemed like a brilliant game, supported my controller which was good and the menus was easy to navigate. Was really impressed until i started a race. then it was disapointment after disapointment. conering is terrible no matter what car what speed or how much you brake, beleive i restarted over 20 times and tried different drive lines and break points and just about managed half a lap before i gave up. Whatever you do do not even traid paint with another car because they will just spin across the front of you and stop you dead as it glues sideways across your front bumper or make you go crazy off the track and head on into a wall.  If your looking to download this id save your time and patience for something that deserves it as this definetly does not. It says something when i have over 17 games on my pc and this is the only one that has pushed me to write a review as its that bad!!!
1269	0	a	I cant seem to get my steering wheel to perform with this game, it always over steers no matter what setting i have, my wheel works perfectly with need for speed games. would not recomend.
1270	0	a	Go buy Race 07 / Race Injection instead, a lot more ♥♥♥♥ to offer than this.
1271	0	a	Deleted it after 10 minutes. Huge dead steering spot on my 360 controller. Broken images in the menus. GTA V driving is more fun.
1272	0	a	Overall it is not a bad game, however it is way too expensive for what is actually offer:  Pros: - One of the best car sounds in games. - Decent realism - Evolving - A lot of options.  Cons: - Price for tracks. - Price for cars. - Price... - DirectX 9 graphics... needs engine overhoul. - Somehow i never found a good 'handling' option for me with my G27 even if i top the charts in times. - Bad forcefeed back - Price.
1273	0	a	It was good previously un recently it keeps on crashed, crashed &amp; crashed. Can't even play. And every little things need to pay, pay and pay.
1274	0	a	This game is like a celebrations chocolate tin  Looks nice on the outside but has a sewing kit inside. What I dont understand how this game mechanic (microtransaction, menu and general ai) is WORST than Simraceway which is just about dead.... (captain Picard Facepalm)
1275	0	a	Its a good thing that its free to play, because i wouldnt want you wasting 10+ dollars on this game.
1276	0	a	Terrible handling, Terrible community, Terrible controls. All in All, the worst racing game I've ever played.
1277	0	a	Waste of time, please don't get this game. So many bugs! No wonder its free!
9466	1	a	Is very fun but would like more tracks and cars that come with the game. I get it though it is a free to play and that is how they make money:(

1284	0	a	I was not impressed. The graphics aren't that bad, but the controlling of the cars is not very easy. The sound is not bad, but it could be better. Plus, half of the game includes buying the cars. Half of them aren't even free. Don't waste your time and money on this. Hope to see better improvements in the future!
1285	0	a	Hey, uninstalling works!
1286	0	a	It's Saturday night, and I can't run a single player race on an existing installation because of some undisclosed server error. This business model sucks.
1287	0	a	I attemped 2 races and both times I failed because of the controls. It is all left or all right, full throttle or none at all. Might have better luck with a pc compatable controller.
1288	0	a	Bad physics and limited options. Doesn't feel like you're doing half of the driving
1289	0	a	Ok so now i have played this game for a solid 3 hours and i am going to tell you guys the +ve's and the -ve's  +ve The sound is absolutely fantastic. You can hear exactly what a racing driver would hear in cockpit and as you go to the outside camera angle the car engine sounds different which is amazing. The handling model is pretty nice with great force feedback. The traction is realistic as well, you got to be patient with the accelerator All cars are really fun to drive and each car seemed to have its own characteristic which was fantastic to see in a game which is free.  -ve I have a XBox 360 controller and it seems like this game hates controllers. When i was coming into a hairpin i press the brake button but the car didn't stop and went straight on. I know where my brake button is. I use the same button for F1 so i am used to it and this issue seems to happen over and over again The online may only be in alpha but its almost perfect. ALMOST. apart from regular lag spikes for 10 sec and you go down from 1st to 4th in a race. It is so frustrating as a gamer to be leading and then lag spike and boom 4th. Also a issue is that not many cars and tracks are given for free so you need to buy most of the cars and tracks using virtual credits which you need to buy  Decession time: The game seems to have more +ve's than -ve's but that doesn't make the game better. The issues i have listed are massive issues which can cause people to rage quit and make a hole in their computer screen so right now, i don't recommend it but hopefully after a few patches the game should be one of the best racing games around. There are other small issues that i don't really care about atm: no time transition, only sunny weather, no dynamic weather
1290	0	a	Everything in this ♥♥♥♥in game is a DLC, if you don't buy anything you will have literally about three cars out of let's say 100 and 2 tracks out of 30 or more. ♥♥♥♥ this.
1291	0	a	There is at least $20000 worth of dlc
1292	0	a	Horrible steering lag, pay-for-everything gameplay, extrmely expensive.  I paid nothing but I still want a refund.
1293	0	a	Free hillclimb map had a disqualifying bug. This is a money pit, even worse then iRacing since the content does not justify it in my opinion.  The good however is that the car sounds are EXCELLENT! Physics seems good as well.   Overall I prefer Assetto Corsa, this is not for me.
1294	0	a	Horible game, the best part was unistalling it!

1297	0	a	Bad physics and limited options. Doesn't feel like you're doing half of the driving
1298	0	a	GTR 2 by simbin.. awesome except they messed up the patch's so it broke online play...  This .. I have played one car with one track, and .. very disappointed.  The car felt sloppy from the outside view, sounds were passable but repetitive, graphics seem dated and the menu system looks a mess.  Never mind the pay for better cars / tracks .. judging from what I have seen, this is going nowhere fast ...
1299	0	a	I honestly don't even know how or where to start with this game. It has no form of tutorial, guide, basic series of single player practice sessions to show you what you get with the game, what you have, game modes, anything. It is basically just a very very old school pick a series pick a car, hit race....that's pretty much it. I find it quite surprising that it has so many users with such a bad interface and menu structure. As a user you honestly don't know where to start.  After some trial and error I eventually discovered that most cars need to be bought, you only get....actually I don't know what you get because it doesn't list anywhere how many or which cars you do get. It's just such a bad user experience. Even ACR with all its problems and browser client mishmash was far supperior.  The first time I started it I basically just got the background cinematics and no menu. After googling around I found that you have to set a start parameter for the steam version. Why isn't this set as standard? Didn't I just install the game through steam?  So after you eventualy get it to work, you have to wonder if you actually have any sound, because there are no effects what so ever in the menu. No clicking efects, no music, no nothing. I played around with my volume until I entered a race and it was too loud.   And finaly we come to the actual driving experience....well...if you use a controller or keyboard you are basically hosed. The cars are mostly unconstrollable unless you have a wheel, and even then I'm not sure the default settings are ok. After much fiddling around with sensitivities, adaptive steering speeds and other settings, I managed to get a relatively ok setting. It worked fine for the car I was using at the time, but as soon as I changed cars, well I needed to see what I could do again.  The menu/interface thing is quite buggy and unintuitive. You have a back button to go back to the game and if you hit back inside the game, as in to go back to the main menu...it takes you back into the matchmaking menu...so basically and infinite loop of back buttons.   Now on to the plus points: After trying out multiple cars, I do have to admit you could 'feel' when one car was heavyer, or lighter, or had softer suspension and that is a very very good thing. It becomes pretty obvious that underneath the bad interface it is running a very good simulation engine.  On the polish oldtimer you can feel the heavy engine at the back trying to oversteer the car. On different DTM cars of the same era/class you can feel the different personlity of each car. I really like that. For example you can tell the Audi V8 is very heavy compared to the Merc 190 or the M3, you can feel that the Mustang has much softer suspension but is stil quite light. The FWD cars do understear in slow corners, and they do lift off oversteer just like they should. Dips in the road do make your car unstable and sometimes create wheelspin (this also sais a lot about the quality and detail of the tracks). This is especially noticeable on some longer high speed corners. The vibrators on the side of the track do unsettle your car and can make it jump up in the air.  So yes, the racing engine underheath is very very good.  The graphics do look good for a racing game. There's not much to say about them. Everything runs smoothly no stutters, high FPS. The amount of detail given to the sound during racing is quite high. It has suspension and pannel squeking.   I'm quite dissapointed to be honest, I really liked all their previous games and those did have much better interfaces and functionality. This is just slopy in so many ways.  From what I have played so far I am tempted to try it some more just because that surprisingly good engine underneath that crap interface. I haven't yet found out how exacly you enter a multiplayer race, there are some challenges and some servers, but instructions are scarce at best. I don't even think there is any form of experience or leveling, but if there is, I wasn't able to find it.
1300	0	a	There is at least $20000 worth of dlc

1338	0	a	Slow app, where you have to pay for everything and crashes when you attempt to race. Deleted.
1339	0	a	Feels like a demo game because of limited tracks and cars options. Graphics are just so so. It will be expensive if you want to buy all the tracks and cars. Defo will uninstall the game. I will just stick to Assetto Corsa and Simraceway.
1340	0	a	♥♥♥♥♥tt
1341	0	a	well :v microtransactions are really hard these days m8s xD
1342	0	a	this game is teriblle the graphics are good but the payment concept is really really annoying basically you get four car models and two tracks to start with, if you want to get any of the other cars or tracks you have to pay real money, you dont get ingame money for racing. so you can consider this free game a demo version, an if you want to pay for everything in this game it will cost around 200$. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS GAME!

1346	0	a	lol what is this stupid game go to hell.
1347	0	a	This game is very good for someone who wants to see what racing sims are like but for someone who is serious about racing sims then this is not good as it is making you pay for loads of vehicles so I would not recommend it for a pro sim racers!
1348	0	a	It may be free but the expereince you get without paying makes it not even worth the hard drive space.
1349	0	a	Takes a year and a day to install. drivting is the worst. 3 gb ram is not enough. overall dont even try it. (i have 8 gb ram
1350	0	a	An 18-wheeler can make sharper turns than these cars
1351	0	a	THIS GAME USES DRM OF THE WORST KIND. You've been warned.  The dev doesn't care about this version anyway, he just works on mobile ports now. Guess that's where the real money is nowadays. NSS5 is still kinda fun, but the game has huge amount of small problems (completely broken match rating system, the game's too easy).  NSS5 is still better than 4 (in which the dev tried to use a 3D engine and failed miserably) but it's just not worth any money. Get NSS3 or 2.
1352	0	a	Urgh, this is just a terrible game. I enjoyed the mobile game until the developer got greedy and turned it into a pay to win game, I played some of the older NSS PC games and found them to be challenging but fun...  This version feels lifeless, a grind against a ruthless manager and players that have as much vision as a 15 year old labrador with cataracts. As a player you feel like you're a golf cart with the slow turning speed and wide turning circle. You can use your ability to read the game to make through balls which can set your team up with a scoring chance and possibly even praise from your manager. This is something that your fellow teammates cannot do, when you call for the ball they go straight to your feet, since this isn't immediate in some cases you have to turn yourself (golf cart) back into the position you were in and by that time the play is dead and in most cases the ball is lost, all your fault  I'm sure with more play I'd adapt to the way the game wants me to play it, but in a world of FIFA and PES there is no room for such amateur gameplay  The energy issue is a common problem in modern NSS games. I lost 40% of my energy on a plane journey to east Europe as part of Europa League game; did I walk? was I pulling the bus? So you buy NRG (oops.. stomach cramps!) and it gives you barely enough energy to last an entire game; if you come on as a sub you get barely enough time to get into the game, try to crank the game time up and you get asked to become a premium member  The developer has fallen far from grace, once a beloved indie developer turned cash hungry EA type wannabe who clearly no longer cares about the PC fan base that gave them their fame
1353	0	a	I loved NSS3. What a great game that was. Unfortunately none of the charm of that title remains in the bones of this terrible game. The controls are terrible. The team AI is terrible. The match rating system is terrible. It's like watching a bunch of grade schoolers run around on the field.   I cannot recommend this title. I can't even find the words to fully deal with my frustration on how far this series has fallen.
1354	0	a	The website for this game series notes that New Star Soccer 2 is popular because it was the last to feature text-based gameplay. That's unsurprising, because the match engine in this is the most clumsy, awkward and rage-inducing one I've ever seen, and I was playing soccer games on a Sega Master System 20-odd years ago. It feels like you need to stand still to receive a pass - not only do team-mates constantly pass well behind your run, but the player has the turning circle of a tank. Having to sign up for an account just to start a game adds to the frustration.
9474	1	a	I actually really like this game. I'm not much of a sports fan, and even then this game is old, but it's a nice football/soccer player simulation. You play games, you make money, spend money, time, and energy on fans, romantic interests and fellow teammates. You also need to maintain a relationship with your manager! The 'gameplay' itself isn't amazing, it's not easy to actually play the ingame matches and be a star player but it's not bad.
9476	1	a	Don't know why but I love this thing. It's fun and addictive.
9478	1	a	+ Control one player, building your stats and working your way up + Simple old-school gameplay that can be hard to put down + Casual presentation that doesn't discourage non-football fans
9480	1	a	If you ever played Kick Off or Sensible Soccer when you were younger,you'll love this.Has a bit more substance to it with abilities to improve and people to impress. Recommend using a gamepad/joystick over keyboard as it makes changing direction a lot easier! It takes a little getting used to the gameplay,but once you get the hang of it,you'll start to enjoy it.
1356	0	a	i prefered the free game on the apps store 
1357	0	a	This game is totally broken.   After a few matches and hundreds attempts to go online, the game now crashes with the message 'Exception Access Violation'. I even tried to fix the settings file -as seen on the discussion pages- but the problem exists. Now i cannot proceed with my saved game/season, it crashes continuously on the same timespot.  The developer dropped the support forum and the updates altogether. It should be removed from Steam Store and buyers should be refunded.   AVOID. [0/10]
9482	1	a	A couple of things...  1 - This is no way worth the 9.99 price tag - Get this in a sale !!!! 2 - Joypad/controller is a MUST !! You will struggle playing on a keyboard. 3 - Signing in sometime's will not connect DRM . 4 - Abandoned long ago so there is no support. 5 - Old style graphics and play style  I came across a few bugs in 40 hours but none that was game breaking, I quite enjoyed this as it was a simple game which reminded me of a old playstation 1 footie game.  It has a few things to do like training skills/skill shots, going to the races and betting on horses, gambling at the casino and buying luxury items and properties.  For a 9.99 price tag this lets the reviews go sour which is fair enough as this is way over priced to the extent you are going to feel ripped off.  Get this for under £4 and it's a bargin for an old style footie game !!!!
9484	1	a	Any fan of soccer will love this game.  It's a game where you play as a player, not as the team, or manager.  You have to train yourself to make yourself better, then try to win the approval of your boss, your teammates, your friends, and potentially  a girlfriend.  With your hard-earned money you can buy yourself luxurious items such as vehicles, a cell phone, etc.  Definitely recommend this to any sports game fans.
9486	1	a	Great game but for now: DONT BUY IT! Servers not working about 1 week and game dont work now.When this problems will dissapear i will change my review,because this is amazing football 'be a pro' game :) Review update 17.4.2014 - Now servers working,but they are VERY unstable!!! :( Strange issues of servers continues! Review update 29.5.2014 - It is still little unstable,but is much better now :) Now i can really recommend this game!
1360	0	a	This game came with a promise to be really good and maybe even better as NSS3 did in the time but unfortunately the developer removed a several great things the series had once and this edition seemed more like a throwback. Due these lacks of any innovation the game quickly will let you bored and make you remember how good NSS3 was.  But the worst thing, and the main reason that really makes this game not worth buying today is that the developer practically abandoned the main version for PC after he started to develop to mobiles, so don't expect updates or more support any time (maybe never).
9488	1	a	Does it get repetitive? Yes Does it get tedious? Maybe Can you stop playing? No
9490	1	a	This game is fun to play, I dont get why it is getting alot of negativity!
1362	0	a	terrible game. I bought it based on the flash game. But ok, let's go: it requires a new subscribe to their site for each career and, if you delete it, it's gone forever and you have to use a new e-mail. I won't get started on how bad is their server. I am really disappointed.
1363	0	a	This 'port' of a fantastic android game is a shame. DRM is stupid. The controls are stupid (without proper gamepad you're ♥♥♥♥ed, also passes and shots are really awfully done). The whole AI where every other player is soooooooo stupid is stupid (+ THOSE ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ COACH COMMENTS!!). I feel stupid as well for being so excited about this game (cuz I really loved New Star Soccer on the phone).  Of course, this is not FIFA, but still, it should have at least some good gameplay, which has not. If the passes were at least better, it would make a huge difference. I really tried to like this game but I just cannot. 4/10
9492	1	a	Better than PES
9494	1	a	also ich finds toll ;D
9496	1	a	been playing since NSS3 and I love it
9498	1	a	Mix a oldschool gameboy football game with fresh add-ons and you got this game. A pretty fun beer &amp; pretzels game.
9500	1	a	Not as good as the app. rip in pepperoni
9502	1	a	
1365	0	a	Awful game. I bought this as i thought it be text like the flash version. But i was wrong, you have to control the players and it is clumsy and terrible and give's your boring tutoirals that are hard and they dont even help you in the matchs. DO NOT BUY AND STICK WITH THE FREE FLASH VERSION
9504	1	a	Although it looks like a simple game, it is really enjoyable and addicting. Along with football/soccer, you also play the life of a football/soccer player. The reality has been implemented via several things such as losing energy while going to play away, not ignoring the girlfriend, making the papers due to sensational events, earning from horse-racing more than football/soccer. So it has a pretty comprehensive content.  In the game, there are also some events irrelevant to reality like the Premier League championship of a team that have actually never been in the top places of the league, the quarter-finals of UEFA Champions League's including at least one team that actually join to the earlier qualification rounds of the tournament, German National Team's scarcely qualifying out of the qualifications for UEFA European Championship and FIFA World Cup... But these add spice to the taste of the game. :)
9506	1	a	It's a fun game but, man, it sure is fast! You might dismiss this game because it doesn't look like FIFA or PES and all, but that would be a mistake. It feels like I'm a real player on a real soccer field playing at real speed. Hopefully I can build up my stats soon so I can keep up with these guys.
1366	0	a	You have to connect to a third party server that never seems to work in order to play.  Also, you can only have one save file per email you register.  If the game were the best thing ever made, maybe I could get over all of that, but really it is not.
1367	0	a	- Purchased before I deployed to a country without internet.  - DRM prevents me from playing the game in offline mode.  - Spent all deployment regretting wasting money.
9508	1	a	I started my career with my team in English lowest division, then I managed to get signed by my team, Spezia. With them I got promoted, I won everything I could win, I scored in every stadium. I won the World Cup also. I realized all my dreams. It's very similar to Sensible world of soccer with RPG elements.  + everything - a bit too easy?  Definitly recommended
9510	1	a	A great game for all football fans and ones that are going to be. The game has some really cool mehanics and its a very fun. I really recomend it.
1369	0	a	Teammates not programmed right (sending passes without aiming), awful controls and awful gameplay. It is a little bit better that it is more 'open world' but it gets out of the ordinary New Star Soccer. The game is totally not worth the 11.99€, hopefully I bought it on the -75% sale. It can only be played properly with a controller which is still a little bit difficult in the beggining because you use only 2 keys. (Congrats for creativity)
9512	1	a	It is very fun except some minor issues that gonna make you want to break your controller from time to time. IE: Sometimes, your character dosen't tackle when you want him to, you kick a perfect pass and your teamate miss it,well it's apparently your fault and the coach gonna take points from you because of that. Or you ask a pass from a teamate and he throw it like 3213 meters from you, well that is also your fault. Also, if you interecpt the ball from their goaler to a player, but doing so the ball goes to a player from the other team, well it counts as a bad pass... I highly recommend not having the coach speech on, unless you want to rage at your game all the time.
1370	0	a	This may well be one of the worst games I've ever played.  Terrible presentation, dreadful AI, mechanics that arbitrarily punish you and mark you down for things that are beyond your contorl and unweildy controls make this game so far from fun it's not even worth playing to see just how bad it really is.  I paid £0.83 for this, and that's £0.84 too much. Do yourself a favour and get Sensible World of Soccer from GoG instead. That's how a football game should be done, not this abomination.
1371	0	a	Just awful. First time i have ever seen a game be so far behind its mobile version. Controls are absolutely dreadful, the players energy dissappears so qucikly you can do a tiny amount of training and even then have less than 50 fitness for every game. The entire in game experience is you watching a ball go everywhere but to you, and even when it does your player never actually keeps the ball, it either goes straight through him or he runs over it.   In summary, the gameplay even on the few occasions you do have the ball is so bad it is like watching a group of quad amputees compete in a swingball tournament, minus the optimism.
9514	1	a	Awesome funny casual football/manager thing, great for relaxing !!!
9516	1	a	The Funnest little game i've played
1372	0	a	Not Working   DONT BUY IT
1373	0	a	I played this for a good chunk of time. It's a fun little casual game, if you can get past the flaws, and mainly the game flat out not working. Yes, beware. Not every user, but I seen PLENTY of people have an issue where they cannot connect to the servers. And this has been going on for years now! The developer said he is trying to fix it, but so far nothing has changed. I don't know exactly what it is but it seems changing hosts would fix it, I could be wrong. Anyways, if you cannot connect to the game, you CANNOT play from my experience. The only help is to 'keep trying, use a proxy', and even 'try leaving the game on overnight' from another forum. (keep trying works until I have to load the game again do to not wanting to play or crashing) which is unacceptable even for an indie game, even made by one person. Don't have online DRM if you can't keep a server working for everyone.  Onto the actual gameplay, if you wanna risk the above, or manage to get through (I had a hell of a time) The gameplay is 'aright' it's a nice unique game, but nothing more than I expect out of a flash game. There is a decent amount of game flaws, but for the most part they can be looked past. I have had the game crash somewhat often as well which is also a downside.  The music isn't good at all, and in a top down football game you really need background music thats enjoyable, minor complaint however, doesn't really change much.   Overall, I'd say the game is worth $5, however this is BEFORE the connection problems. I don't think this game should even be allowed to be sold on Steam with the current issues of the connecting. As it is preventing plenty of people from playing the game according to forum posts, with no help other then what I mentioned and basically a 'I'll fix it' years ago. Definitely do not recommend this game, but if you can look past the horrible connection issues, it should provide some fun for a little while.
1374	0	a	This game is very bad DO NOT BUY
9518	1	a	This is posibly the most depressing game I've ever played. I'm not even joking.  It's a great reminder that you can't ever win in life. No matter what your abilities are, you'll always be at the mercy of your circumstances.  Do well at your job and your co-workers will probably hate you and hinder you at every opportunity - after all, they pursue the same vague idea of glory and prosperity you do. And you only have so much time on this planet and that time, you will learn, is not nearly enough to please even a fraction of the people who matter. The small victories you get every once in a while won't fuel you forever either.  Do poorly and everyone will hate you - your family and fans disappointed, your friends and significant other alienated, the press chewing your fat until they decide you're yesterday's news - and then there you are, stuck on the bench with your only friend left: the drink.  But of course your boss will always be there to provide a stone cold, insatiable father figure: shouting unhelpful and meaningless nuggets of wisdom like 'Take your time' and 'Think about when you call' every step of the way; providing the minimal required amount of reinforcement to your Skinner box of an existence to keep you going.  Football is Life, and Life is a Smelly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.
1376	0	a	this game sucks hell you have to sign up to an online profile then the gameplay was broing as hell even for free this game still sucks
1377	0	a	Like stepping back in time about twenty years, this is a Master-System-level game wrapped up in Megadrive-level packaging. Some of the minigames are fun for a while, and the general idea of trying to balance training, games, social life, and other responsibilities in a professional football career is a good one, but ultimately repetitive implementation, odd choice for some mini-games (a higher/lower card guessing game for contract negotiations?) and a match engine 25 years out of date (Sensible Soccer is relatively state-of-the-art) let down what could have been a deep, feature-rich professional footballer career simulator. Still fun for a time due to some fantastic ideas (online leaderboards without demanding direct PvP? Yes, please!), and a series I'd love to see progress, but this edition is simply too basic, particularly during matches which quickly become an exercise in frustration. Worth a playthrough after picking up on the very cheap, but it has a long way to go to be more than just a collection of good ideas.
1378	0	a	★☆☆☆☆
1379	0	a	Needed to create account on third party database, tried to play, 'could not connect to xxx server', disgusting
1380	0	a	Repetitive, badly made basic stuff.
9520	1	a	I have owned this game for a long time and was a part of the beta testing way back when it was first released. The control system is great and there's a certain amount of nostalgia involved as I used to play SWOS many moons ago.  Highly recommend this game, particularly given the price.
9522	1	a	Very fun and addicting
1383	0	a	it sucks balls
1384	0	a	awful keyboard controls, players running around like headless chickens... try to head the ball? dear god you'll scream at the monitor trying...awful awful...oh and you only get half the game, because they want you to pay MORE to get a premium account...no thanks.... refund requested...
1385	0	a	As a NSS3 player, I feel like this is a significant downgrade. Practice is easy and dull, the game controls worse and with much less precision, the whole experience somehow feels simplified and dumbed down, it misses the charm of NSS3. I've been hugely disappointed, I didn't get near as much enjoyment out of this game as I did from NSS3 and gave up on it after a few hours - wasted cash.
9524	1	a	ref sent me off for an ACCESS_VIOLATION_ERROR on goal, was banned from playing for 3 months
9526	1	a	I hate football, so I'm not interested in this game. (It was sent to me free by Bundlestars). However I imagine if you like football you would enjoy this.
1387	0	a	As today, I'm really surprise that is still on sale.  It's bugged, and the design is way inferior to New Star Soccer 5.  For example: have you ever seen a player from the Far Oer second tier with a price tag of 2M £? Here...
9528	1	a	More useful videogame than the PES titles that made their way to Steam.  Note: (Likely) only jolly with gamepad. Note2: Unfortunately you need to set your desired game speed every time you start the game.
1390	0	a	Awful controls, just AWFUL stay away or play a real soccer game instead.
1391	0	a	If you like the idea of being so frustrated that you want to punch your PC screen through, buy this game. It's highly frustrating and definitely not worth the 10 ♥♥♥♥ing pounds.   I'd really like to claim my money back to be honest.
9530	1	a	Top game sadly no controller capability, fun footie game
1392	0	a	Connection problems!!! You are selling a game that does not work. It is not just me, just read the forum which I wish I did before buying it. This is a very bad business.
9532	1	a	Every bit as fun as any PES/FIFA game I've ever played, at a fraction of the price.
1393	0	a	The game is nice and the gamplay is also very amusing. I dont know for other people but i dont not prefer online games and since i played other titels of NSS did this game dissapoint me for the basic reason it was online and i was in a Club with other people i actually knew from my actually City - this is not something i liked. I would reather see the game be developed on the old basis with fake player names and therefore would be more focus on other aspects of the game like sposor nogatations as A LAGER repertuar of things you can by. Oh and by the way the puzzle in-game that define all of your Relationships in the game are REALLY pointless.
1394	0	a	This game is getting boring after you played a few seasons. Bit overpriced imo.
9534	1	a	Deeper than it looks, destroys career mods of Fifa and PES.
9536	1	a	This is an arcadey football game with interesting RPG elements.  You are playing the part of a single footballer. That's a very refreshing mechanic, which hasn't been used in many other games recently. That makes this game fairly refreshing.  There are almost two games feeding into each other: Firstly, there's playing the matches. This is a good, but not stellar, arcade style football game, with a tiled view from behind the goal, similar to the various Amiga games of the 1990s. You just control your own player rather than the whole team. The game is fast-paced and holds your attention. The 'one player' mechanic is also very different to most other games.  Secondly, there's the RPG game. This has you 'levelling up' your player, maintaining relationships with team mates and friends, saving up for houses, flash cars and the like. You can also do several other things, such as gamble your money at the casino or racetrack. The mini-games providing this are all very simple, but there are a lot of them and they're competently done.  The most interesting part comes where the two games overlap. Should you pass to a teammate rather than scoring yourself - because then he'll like you and be more likely to pass to you next time, or do you score yourself because you want the goal bonus to buy some new boots? When scoring a goal, do you celebrate with the fans to improve your relationship with them, or do you celebrate with the manager so he's more likely to pick you next week? I found this interesting and refreshing, and brings some planning and thinking to the arcade-style match engine.  If you're wondering whether this is the same game as its more famous cousin on iOS, it's not. This is much more fleshed out and playable, particularly the match engine which is real-time. Incidentally, if you haven't played the iOS version then it's well worth the price.  It's worth pointing out that the game is nigh-on impossible to play using keyboard and mouse. You'll definitely need some kind of controller. I just used a cheap USB one, which worked absolutely fine. The buttons are user-definable.  The game does get a bit samey after a while - it's essentially the same game 20 hours in as it is 20 minutes in. However, at the price that's not a huge problem.  I enjoyed playing this. If you like arcadey football games, or are bored of FIFA and want something different, then this is well worth a look.
9538	1	a	depressed soccer player simulator
1396	0	a	Buy the app, this one is REALLY BAD. UNPLAYABLY BAD
1397	0	a	I love the idea of managing only one player, doing a carrier etc. and this could have been a good game but in the end it is just super frustrating.  Mainly the little guy im suppose to control doesn't do what I want. Oh yes, I could play hours and maybe my skills would increase so much that I could do miracles with the really bad controls but I even doubt so.  Somewhat I feel like there is no freedome in this game. It's hard to explain but I feel like the game was developped to be play only the way the devs intended it: the long, frustating, hard way.
9540	1	a	This is actually the best football game on mobile and tablets. U'll suffer the highs and lows of its simply presented matches with the grin of a true addict plastered across your face. Highly recommend!
9542	1	a	Amazing game, Fifa career mode with old NES/SNES design.  The game i would have loved to have when i was young. Ah nintendo..  Gameplay is annoying at first but giving it a bit of time it becomes enjoyable.  Dev: can you remove the DRM?
9544	1	a	9.5/10 If you are a cricket fan this is the game for you, it is superbly done by Big Ant Studios.  The batting and bowling feel authentic and the ball physics are just spectacular, the only down sides and the are only a few:   - You cant (as yet) change the lineups of squads during a career - The animations for fielding and catching a little strange sometimes and regular nutty catch angles happen when a straight forward catch would have sufficed. - The AI is stupidly good at running you out can be a little unfair at times, and in the whole time ive played, mostly simulated for bowling, but I still havent managed to create a runout. - Animations for quick yes then no calls can result in a buggy player and can sometimes end up in a run out because the batsmen didn't put his bat down.  Update: Recent updates to the game have made it more enjoyable to play, see patch notes for further details.  Finished one of my Careers, a little disappointed in the end, you cant even view your stats at the end of your career.    Very few things would need to be added to make this the game even better:  - Such things would be better stat displays,  - Being able to change lineups during career,  - If possible auto updating database with new players every season,  - More varied and better looking animations for batting, bowling, fielding.  - Dynamic Weather/modified current weather system.  But other then those few things this is in incredible game from this studio, the physics are superb, you actually feel like you earn't the edge behind or that LBW.   Definately would recommend if you are a serious cricket player.  Looking forward to DBC 17.
9546	1	a	Ultra realistic! Shane Watson actually wastes your reviews!
9548	1	a	Best Cricket game ever made, if not one of the best sports games i have ever played!  Very addictive, you cant just play 1 game at a time. Just starting out in a career as a 16 year old fast bowler/batsman. The ability to simulate the game until it is your turn to bat or bowl is good if you don't want to sit around and watch the others pile on the runs while you sit in the pavilion waiting your turn.  Big thumbs up to Big Ant Studios for producing an amazing game.  If you love Cricket then this is a must, if you don't this is still a great sports game and a great way to set foot in the the amazing sport.
9550	1	a	Don Bradman Cricket 14 is the greatest cricket game I have ever played.  The developer, Big Ant Studios, have really gone above and beyond to create a cricket game that is vastly different to previous cricket games.   The batting and bowling are completely revamped.  Instead of using the d-pad to choose which direction to hit the ball and the face buttons to choose what type of shot to play, batting involves using both the left and right analog sticks. The left analog stick is used to choose which foot to play (i.e front or back foot) and the right stick dictates which direction you want to play the shot. Holding the bumper buttons and flicking the right stick in the direction you want to hit the ball, produces different shots. For example, holding the left trigger button with the left stick causes you to hit a lofted shot. It takes a bit of getting used to, but once you master the controls, it feels very intuitive, vastly superior to previous cricket game controls and a lot of fun.  Bowling has also been changed for the better. Instead of having a dot on the ground and showing your opponent where you are going to bowl, there is a new control scheme. First, you have to choose the length of the ball that you want to bowl, using the face buttons (i.e A for good length, B for short length or Y for full length). As your bowler approaches the crease, you flick back the right stick and then flick forward in the direction you want to bowl the ball. This is an amazingly new and fresh way to bowl in cricket games. It allows for a more authentic bowling experience and is alot more fun and engaging, then placing a dot on the pitch and just passively pressing buttons. I can't believe the day where I would say that bowling is potentially more fun than batting in a cricket game.  Graphics are nice and crisp. The grounds are rendered really well and the lighting is top-notch.  Sounds of the bat hitting the ball are satisfying to hear and the appeals of bowlings are exciting.  Overall, Don Bradman Cricket 14 is an amazing sports game. It is definitely up there with other sports games such as FIFA and the NBA 2K games, in terms of realism, fun and authenticity.   A must-have for all cricket fans and even just fans of sports in general.  9/10.
9552	1	a	The best cricket game, I have ever played.  + Batting and bowling is quite realistic. + With the help of Cricket academy in game, you can get all original players/teams from international as well as club level. + Career mode is quite innovative, where you have to play with a batsman/bowler and rise up the ranks to get selected at international level. The only problem in this mode is that, the difficulty can get increased if you start doing well, and you need very good reflexes to bat at difficulties above PRO. Also, you cannot change the batting order of your player, at any point of time in career mode. + There are lots of options to customise the game - pitch settings/weather/overs, etc. + Game can get real addictive, once you know the basics. + Great graphics and animations.  - Online system is quite broken, but if you have friends who own the game, then it's easy to play matches with them. - I know it's not much, but you cannot see the bowling statistics fully in the scoreboard. Also, some other statistics which were present in the EA versions of cricket are absent. - No auto save features while playing. You only have an option to Save and Quit the game. - The AI hardly ever makes a mistake. (//Rant)  Overall 9/10.   Note: You need to own a controller to play the game.
9554	1	a	In short: this is the best cricket game I've ever played.   The controls felt really strange initally, but just playing the demo and batting in the nets was a strangely satisfying experience. I enjoy all the disciplines and being able to be succesful actually requires skill. I can't claim to be very good at anything in this game, but it feels very similar to my real-life cricketing abilities, so there's that.  I've spend the majority of my time playing the career mode in this game. It feels pretty realistic, except that with some of my performances, i'm sure my county should have left me out of some games.   Is the game perfect? No. The commentary is pretty inaccurate and repetitive. There's a lot of missed catches for seemingly no reason. And although I enjoy bowling, sometimes it's really hit-and-miss about how to dismiss a batsmen. But as that's similar to the real thing, I guess that can't be a complaint.  If you enjoy cricket games, buy it. There's nothing I've played that's come close.
9556	1	a	Amazing game , the only dislike i have is the fielding when catching can be buggy ,for example the change of direction some players seam to glitch (idk how to describe it someone back me up lol) and it just looks so unnatural and awkward , also the game difficulty is very realistic , as an avid crickiter and supporter (Durham and England) i feel this game does cricket justice i struggle to win on pro never mind expert so hats off to those who do , batting is fluid , bowling the same , probably one of the best sports games i've played , the devs should feel very very proud of this game its an absolute masterpiece , one thing i would like for the next game is more name licenses that would really complete it and obviously with no other cricket games been made this shouldn't be to hard other than the cost which is a stumbling block ,however thanks some people you can download all the real name squads anyway . GREAT GAME
9558	1	a	Excellent cricket game I am loving it... thanks to the developers
9560	1	a	It Literally is the best cricket video game in the history. It PACKS everything you need. Best Gameplay Engine? Check. Best Game Graphics ? Check. Best Online Versus ? Check. Best Modding Capability ? Check. Best Commentary ? Check (Not Completely though :P) It may not have legend commentators, but there are 2 guys who do the job well and exactly same most of the time.I mean repeated dialogues for a shot. But they sound well. 
9562	1	a	This is by far the best cricket game ever made, this does not however mean that everything in the game is awesome. One thing I find very difficult in this game is the steep learning curve for batting and bowling. Bowling is probably a tad easier than batting since batting involves making all your decisions in mere seconds which includes footwork, line and length and direction all in 1 second. That being said does not necessarily mean that the batting is broken, on the contrary if your footwork, timing and shot selection is spot on you are in for something amazing. A lot of people do not understand why they find edges even after timing the ball perfectly and choosing the right shot selection, but they forget that the 3rd element in batting the direction of your feet when playing the shot. The only way to master the batting is time in the nets, and alot of it.  Overall this game is by far the best cricket game, no cricket game before this come close and it is definately worth the money for cricket fans. Casual players will maybe get frustrated by the batting and bowling controls because of the complexity, but I love it, the game tends more to a simulation than being an arcade cricket game. You will not be hitting 6 sixes in one over that easily and when you achieve this you can actually be proud, since it is a feat.  Gameply: 9 Graphics: 7 Sound: 7  Final Score: 8  I hope this helps, enjoy!
9564	1	a	This is the best cricket game so far, great game considering it's 1st from Big Ant Studios. I have previously tried EA's 2002, 2004, 2005, 2007 and Codemaster's Brian Lara 2005, 2007 and Ashes Cricket 2009. And nothing came as close to cricket as this one. Probably EA's 2005 and Brian Lara 2007, Ashes Cricket 2009 were good, but this one just feels right. Graphics are not that impressive, but good enough. Some of the players downloaded online do really look-a-like. Stadiums are very few, also changing the casual match settings takes time, hope they make an easy menu for this next time. Commentary is good, funny, enjoyable. Gameplay is very fun, batting you can actually play shots in 360 degrees. I haven't quite got hang of bowling, especially spin, but even that feels good. There is even DRS system, quite fun to review umpire's decision and watch it. I got limited edition from local e-Tailer. It came with controller in the box, maybe not as good as XBox 360 one, but does feel good compared to sub-500 INR controllers I have used in past. Was pretty sweat deal due to clearance sell. this is 1 of the best games that I have seen for a while iwhen it comes to cricket games.  Excited for DBC17 now
9566	1	a	Best Cricket game ever! All cricket lovers don't miss this game.  Shot selections are awesome and decent bowling options.  Would take a while though to tune yourself to play shots.
9568	1	a	The Best Cricket game ever.
9570	1	a	First cricket game which plays and runs like the real thing. There is a great ballance of skill required to be good at this game however if you want to score heavy you still can. If you enjoy and undertand cricket then this is a cert to get, if you play cricket then dont even think twice.
9572	1	a	8/10  Probably the best cricket simulation the gaming world has seen. Though there are some flaws, the gameplay is rather good accompanied by hyperbolic commentators that make you laugh every once in a while owing to the absurdity of their comments with relevance to the shot you play or the ball you bowl.   While players get to choose from a variety of shots when batting, most of the shots do not look authentic onscreen and the batsmen run way too slow unless the players choose to sprint.  While bowling is probably the highlight of the game, the much needed boost the game requires is an increased inventory of bowling actions.  Out of all the aspects of the game, fielding is the closest to real life. Another important aspect to highlight is the extremely cartoonish appearance of cricketers.  The game makers have evidently thrown their backs into making this game. The varied features, chaperoned by a few changes, will make this a game for the history books.
9574	1	a	I have to say i was skeptical all the way throughout the game's development. I ignored trying it out on console as i prefer gaming on the pc (and their version of AFL Live was a far better experience on pc than on console so i figured i would not double dip in this instance).   In a nutshell you have to forget about how you played cricket games in the past, now you really have to concentrate and work for your runs when batting. Bowling is a little more simple, but i assume on higher difficulty levels there will be a bigger challenge when bowling.   The graphics are a bit hard to get used to at first, depending on the weather..... things REALLY stand out on a nice fine sunny day but on overcast days the graphics are not as nice. It's a cricket game after all and the only thing that really matters i the action on the pitch, and that is very detailed.   I encourage anyone that is a cricket fan to buy this, you will enjoy it. I encourage any American that is curious about the game to try it out as well.  In conclusion i will say that this is the best cricket game i have played since Shane Warne Cricket '99 on playstation and pc.
9576	1	a	This is one great game....so far it has been right there on the top, putting behind EA and Codemasters...Thanks..!
9578	1	a	Simply put, the best cricket game of this generation (and the previous one combined).  You need a gamepad (preferably an Xbox 360 controller) to play the game on your PC due to the nature of the controls. You need an analog stick to accuractely place your shots. A keyboard just will NOT work.  Once you get hang of the controls, ball physics and other awesome mechanics of this game, you will truly fall in love with it.  There are definitely issues with a few jerky animations here and there and a little boring and monotonous commentary, the great gameplay easily makes up for these issues.  Pros: - Great gameplay for a Cricket game, easily the best of this and the last generation combined. - Detailed controls. Easy enough to start hitting boundaries and sixers but really hard to master. - Great replays, DRS (Decision Review System), ball mechanics and other fun stuff including lots and lots of statistics. - Online Multiplayer mode with the ability to save games to continue later (You can play full Test matches with your friends). - Lots and lots of very realistic looking players and and team uniforms. - Many game modes including a Career mode, tournaments, competitions and casual play. - Great comfortable camera angles to choose from. - Did I say you can field manually? - Full ability to make changes to teams and players through the Don Bradman Academy. Now play your favorite historical cricket players! - The most realistic and fun cricket game for many years now.  Middleground: - Steep learning curve. - Could do with a field mini-map during balling and batting. - Decent graphics and audio (excluding commentary). - Requires an Xbox 360 controller for Windows. - Not a great teacher for those new to Cricketing rules etc. (Not an issue for cricket lovers)  Cons: - Twitchy animations sometimes. - Due to the complex nature of the game, there are some bugs and issues which should hopefully be ironed out quickly. As of this review, such issues are few and dont really bother too much. - Commentary can get boring fast. - Lack of 'Voice Chat / Typing Chat' during multiplayer matches. You have to use Steam, TeamSpeak, etc. for it.  If you are a cricket lover and own a gamepad to play this with, get Don Bradman Cricket 14 now! And if you don't own a gamepad, still get this game and buy an Xbox 360 controller ASAP!  Now I am done selling this, go and get it!  Edit: Made a few changes to the Pros and Cons list.
9580	1	a	If you have any interest at all in cricket - get this game.  You'll definitely have an advantage coming to grips with the mechanics if you have an understanding of cricket (what shots to play to different deliveries, etc), and the learning curve is a little stiff, but that's exactly how it should be, cricket is a game of fine margins.  The PC version is patched regularly, and the devs are very responsive. Couldn't recommend this any more highly.

9584	1	a	The Best Cricket game Ever Made!!!
9586	1	a	Probably one of the best sportinh games ever developed. Love the feel of the game. Worth buying a controller just for this game.
9588	1	a	It is undoubtedly the best cricket game ever developed. Feels amazing when you smash the ball for the six or you play a wonderful cover drive and you really feel like celebrating when you take a wicket. The BARS introduced in this game is again the USP of this game along with other in depth details kepth in mind my the developers.  Thanks a lot BIG ANTS STUDIOS for such a Great Cricket Game which the Cricket Crazy fans wanted since long.
9590	1	a	The best ever cricket game made ever. Easy to play tough to master. Great deal of satisfaction seeing that bowling with a plan rewards you with a wicket, or the batsman sees your plan and smacks you for a 6. Great realism , great controls all round great Game!
9592	1	a	Best cricket game till date . Pros Very organic gameplay Realistic gameplay  can certainly improve upon nicer graphics and environment in uture
9594	1	a	Brilliant cricket game. There is a bit of a learning curve to pick the timings correctly, but it is rewarding in the end.
9596	1	a	Probably one of the best sportinh games ever developed. Love the feel of the game. Worth buying a controller just for this game.
9598	1	a	Definately the best cricket game ever (not counting the International Cricket Captain management games, but this probably beats them too). Great career mode where you create player and take control exclusively of him, rather than the whole team. Really nice player and team editor too, and the community creations means it's not a big deal that the game lacks licenses. You can just download pretty good representations from any team you can think of from the cricket academy.
9600	1	a	Awesome game!!!!   Full in-depth cricketing experience.   Brings out the true nature of cricket.   Also focuses on the physics that cricket has, from swing to slow balls, from perfectly timed slog to ill timed edges.   A complete cricketing experience without getting up from the couch.   Big Ant studios have hit this one out of the ground.
9602	1	a	Best cricket game. Amazing graphics and game engine. The scoreboard could be different for each stadium and the commentary could have been better. May be in the next version they will add manager version to the game.
9604	1	a	Brilliant cricket game. There is a bit of a learning curve to pick the timings correctly, but it is rewarding in the end.
9606	1	a	The Best Cricket Game ever.
9608	1	a	Awesome game!!!!   Full in-depth cricketing experience.   Brings out the true nature of cricket.

9610	1	a	One of the best cricket games available.
9612	1	a	its a excellent game to play...if u r a real cricket lover.......
9614	1	a	awesome and addictive !!!!
9616	1	a	I know very little about cricket. All that I know is what I learned by watching it during my trips to India (where you can always find it on TV). I still suck at this game, but have gotten a little better as I have played.  With that said, this is a fun game. It seems to play like a real game.
9618	1	a	Without much time invested in the game so far I can already tell that this is going to be a firm favourite of mine for some time to come.  I am a big cricket fan and an equally big video game fan. I have been playing cricket games for as long as I can remember from Graham Gooch's cricket on the C64, Super International cricket on the SNES, most of the thoroughly excellent Brian Lara games, the complex cricket captain series, the hit and miss quality of the EA series and more recently the frustrating codemasters releases and Cricket Revolution. This game very clearly sets a new benchmark for cricket games.  The batting system is joyus. The game rewards you for reactions and punishes you for playing premeditated shots. You are forced to consider the implications of working the ball around the pitch for long term accumulation or pinch hitting for quick runs and the bowlers adapt to your style of batting and actively try and out think you.  Bowling is a great improvement on previous games where instead of selecting a spot on the pitch to hit, you focus on line and length and take wickets through variation and guile. Bowling the same ball over and over again is, like real cricket, an invitation for the batsman to score where as subtle variations on pace, spin/swing and bowling position as well as bowling to a plan gives wickets in a similar way to real life.  This game is highly polished in particular the in game implementation of the DRS system and the availability of reviews is fantastic. Graphics are clean and crisp although not without the occasional error or glitch. I have not encountered anything game breaking personally.  The career mode is probably where I will spend most of my time. In a similar way to the 'be a pro' mode in Fifa games you start as a green and eager 16 year old and work your way through your local team through to the international arena honing and developing your skills along the way.    Another major positive for me is the ability to mod the game with real player and team likenesses and the continued support by the developer to patch in functional and bug improvements. Currently the co-op mode is missing but this is to be patched in at a later time. I appreciate the effort to get the game to the market and it clearly has been designed and developed by people who love the game. Once co-op mode has been release I can see this becoming a very popular feature.  In short, if you are a cricket fan and you are sitting on the fence about this game then I can assure you there is enough here to keep you entertained. It plays more like cricket than any other game I have played. If you need me, I'll be in the nets.
9620	1	a	Ok the graphics are good but not the best I have ever seen. Community support for current national/State/County/etc teams is fantastic. Even up-to-date umpires can be downloaded!  Some things I love about this game:  -Net practise actually relates to matchplay (unlike most cricket games). -Every over is NOT a 16-24 run over. -You are actually rewarded experience-wise to play three defensive shots an over, and playing yourself in (gaining confidence) makes batting easier later. -Weather &amp; pitch condition matter. You WILL run out of time in some 4-day and test matches. -Bowling does seem a little too easy at the moment, however, I have only been playing on easier settings so far. -The orthodox cricket shots for a specific ball get you the best results over time. -Has some small things that need tweaking but.... this is easily the Best Cricket game I have ever played!
9622	1	a	The best cricket game ever made. Difficult to master and one truly for the cricket fanatic. If BLIC 2005 was the hit and giggle, slap and tickle t20 of the cricket gaming arena, then this is test cricket. The bowling and batting controls are new and logical, whilst nice touches like the DRS system make it a well put together package. Scoring rates are realistic (don't expect to go pasting bowlers all over the place from the off) and sensible bowling is often rewarded. The lack of players is made up for by a set up that allows for a mod community to make up for this, who have already made custom umpires (so far there are very good Steve Bucknors and Dickie Bird but no David Shepherd yet...).   The terrible commentary (simple crowd noises would have suited me to be honest) and less good fielding are things you can live with. It's such a shame we've had to wait until 2014 to wait for a worthy successor to Brian Lara Cricket 96 on the Mega Drive...
9624	1	a	Best ever cricket game!
9626	1	a	love the game 7 out of ten   why 7 cause the updates have stopped needs more updates it is the best cricket game but could do with some improvment
9628	1	a	brilliant game 
9630	1	a	Most addictive game for the cricket fans. Definitely recommended.
9632	1	a	great game so far....i play all type of cricket game...this one is real one....and multiplayer feature make its great more
9634	1	a	This is The Cricket Game, it is the best around surely it has a lot to improve thts what sequels are for but this game is a masterpiece. Made by cricket fans with love for cricket for crickrt fans and others too
9636	1	a	The playstyle of this game is nice. Overall easily the best cricket game that I've come across. It's fun batting and bowling, which has seemingly been a tough task in most cricket games (lol).   Although I don't quite understand any overarching batting strategy existing in the game, i.e. unsure if you can demoralize the bowler... (there could be mechancs like that, could not tell), it's fun dealing with each delivery for its merits since the controls are well designed.   The bowling is more difficult to master, but I felt effectiveness in employing an overall strategy rather than just trying for a wicket every ball. That feels like quite a feat for a cricket game since in other games there's usually a sweet spot or a common strategy to rinse-repeat. Didn't feel like that in this game. That said, I'm not quite convinced by the spin bowling in this game. Hurts my thumbs.  I feel the statistics element of the game could be improved. Cause effect between games played and statistics (outside of career mode) should be clearer. And the career mode could have tournaments in it - would make sense to me. Also why can't a batting alrounder open the batting? :)  Overall I have fun playing this game. Can play, watch some TV, chill out. Was rather addictive to get my first character into all the international teams, and as captain.
9638	1	a	Ive played 90 plus hours so far and still satifies me to hit a 6 or take a wicket.

9642	1	a	Top Game
9644	1	a	Great game! Awesome cricket game to be played Multiplayer great and career mode with single player mode is also great. Feels like real  A must have for all cricket fans
9646	1	a	Ive played 90 plus hours so far and still satifies me to hit a 6 or take a wicket.
9648	1	a	Easily the best cricket game of this console generation and possibly of any generation. Yes, this is very probably the finest cricket game ever made - though that's not really saying very much.
9650	1	a	If you thought a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ wont buy this game , you have been mis lead :'(
9652	1	a	Hands down the best cricket game made to date, and with a developing team that takes community input to heart.
9654	1	a	Great Cricket game after a long time 9/10 :)
9656	1	a	The Best Cricket Game Ever Period
9658	1	a	Easily the greatest cricket game ever... The depth of its gameplay is unparalleled,and deserves to be played so that we can get a sequel at some stage.
9660	1	a	'You playing that cricket game again?!' - Dad 2015  Like Cricket? Buy it. 10/10
9662	1	a	best cricket game i ever played :D
9664	1	a	It's been a while since I've played a cricket game. A lot of them just looke like a re-hashing of a previous version...but finally we get something a little different.  The controls are probably the biggest thing about this game. It gives a more natural feel to the game, almost like you are actually out there. But they aren't clumsy as they are in other games (FIFA for instance), and there's definitely room for error when using the tiny thumbsticks.  The immersion of being in pro camera mode and batting in the middle is like nothing I've felt in any sports game. Taking penalties in FIFA is probably the closest I've gotten to the nervousness and sweaty palm-ness of facing a fast bowler late on day 5 trying to save a game in DBC14. It's like real life!  The moddability of the game is a plus and the developers clearly haven't left PC gamers by the wayside like we've seen with so many other sports games.  Having said all that, the game is not perfect. What sports game is? There are some weird animations and typical situations which are unrealistic. The game has some annoying bugs like playing all five tests in a series at one ground, or players not running after the ball when fielding, and the constant hitting of stumps when throwing the ball to the keeper or bowler, or the keeper getting stuck on the stumps...ugh. The selection of players in career mode is stuck on whatever the default line up was and never seems to change which can be frustrating, also you are stuck on your batting position for your whole career.   I'm sure I could keep going on about what could be improved, but at the end of the day this is a solid game from a local Aussie company, and they've done an admirable job. Definitely worth it if you like cricket games. Possibly worth it if you just like sports and are curious about cricket.
9666	1	a	best cricketing game ever
9668	1	a	About time I wrote a review...
9670	1	a	two words: love it  best Cricket game ever  Now At least we can compare graphics with BasketBall and FIFA series ;) Gameplay is awesome
9672	1	a	I honestly can't praise this game enough. If you like cricket (and let's face it, what right thinking person doesn't) this is a must. Vast amount of options and game types with an excellent career mode. This is a great base to build an ongoing franchise around and Big Ant Studios provide after-sales support that is beyond anything that I've seen for any other title. The only thing that is missing is the option to replace the title music with Soul Limbo by Booker T &amp; The MG's.  Just a quick update...over two years later and over 900 hours of game time...it is still a great game and I am still playing it. It will not be surpassed until DBC17 is released.
9674	1	a	Don bradman cricket is certainly the best cricket game ever made. The best thing about it is the difficulty which treds a perfect line between playability and challenging.
9676	1	a	If you know how to play cricket, its the best cricket game we ever had.   Note: Needs a controller so make sure you have one.   Pros: 1. Proper simulation. Scores are proper and you won't be hitting a six every ball. 2. Good enough graphics. 3. Lots of game modes. Create your own tour, team, match practice, career etc.etc. 4. 20 or so proper stadiums. 5. Has a learning curve. So it is challenging.   Cons: 1. You can't play without controller. All the various foot and bat movements not possible without analog controls.  2. You need to be online to start this game as an anti piracy check. 3. As expected, commentary becomes repetitive pretty fast. 4. Don't wait for a sale. Has never happened and will never happen.   In my opinion... 8.5/10
9678	1	a	Best Cricket Game to Date -- 10/10  This game wouldn't be what it is if it hadn't been for the tremendous support from the Big Ant Studios.   It's been almost 2 years since the release but thanks to continuous support by Big Ant Studios, Don Bradman Cricket hasn't become boring/cliched. In terms of gameplay, this game won't get old anytime soon but the graphics have started to give the feeling of being outdate but nonetheless I'd say it's still good for another year.   I've been playing this game since the release date and I've seen it evolve. It has become the best cricket video game to date. If you think about this game as just a sports simulation, it really is an achievement. We've never seen any Cricket game with such realism and elaborate gameplay mechanics before.  I can't give enough credit to BIG Ant Studios for coming through with such elaborate and sophisticated Cricket game despite knowing the fact that Cricket Video Games doesn't have much market.  I'd strongly recommend this game to every Cricket fan.
9680	1	a	If you like cricket its the game for you.   If you dont why are you here.
9682	1	a	The best cricket game since EA Cricket 07. The graphics are good and the game mechanics are wonderful. Really enjoying it. Whilst there are plenty of great aspects to the game, mainly the bowling and batting mechanics the fielding is not as great as sometimes the fielders become super fast and sometimes super slow which considerbly reduces the realism in the game and can make you frustrated.
9684	1	a	Wow, by far the best cricket simulation I have ever played. This is a keeper!
9686	1	a	Simply the best cricket game made ! Takes a while to get used to the controls but great in game physics make this a must buy for cricket fans.
9688	1	a	The best cricket experience I have had on any platform since Super International Cricket on the SNES. It is easy to pick up, but hard to master, and it just hooks you right in.   If you like cricket, if you are a bit of an arm chair cricket tragic, then pick this up, you won't be dissapointed.
9690	1	a	Certainly not a bad game by any stretch, Sim styled Cricket is something that hasn't been done well hell we've hadn't had a decent Cricket game since the PS2/Xbox days and that's saying a lot. Although it is decent, I do have a few issues nothing major but issues nonetheless that I feel should Big Ant address them it make the new release a lot better.  Lack of customization in career.  For me any sports game that allows you to put yourself in the game has to really pull out the stops for it to feel like a representation of yourself and have it as you want it and while it's not bad, not having any options to change bowling actions or having a preferred style of batting whether you're more into wristy flicks and a batsman who is looking to time to ball instead of someone who is a brute and is looking to put a lot of power into the stroke.   I think BAS missed a great opportunity to make the career mode one of the highlights but as it happens it's just lacking thus far.  Batting.  While for the most part, batting is generally okay I feel there is not a lot of variety in shot animations. Very seldom you will see a batsman go full blooded and extend the stroke for say a straight drive or a on drive as you see in game, for the most part they will generallly push the ball back down the ground and allow the timing to get the runs.  Also why no normal advancing shots? Seems strange you can't use your feet to work a ball into the gap instead of trying to launch it out of the ground.  Bowling.  Much like batting, bowling is in general done very well, can't argue with the variation given, although it's a little irritating that left handed bowlers stats are coded incorrectly Eg: When making a left arm pacer, in order to have a good outswinger from the left hander you have to set the best delivery to 'In Swinger' perhaps a little nit picky but still, it shouldn't happen.  Fielding and AI  Probably the weakest area for me. Well struck shots that are next to fielders just result in them standing still then diving too late to get the ball and that's rather frustrating to watch.  Catching animations are also a little odd especially when the wicketkeeper is catching edges istead of just taking a regulation catch they will turn their back towards the ball and somehow just dive on it but catch it nonetheless although funny I don't think we would see MS Dhoni do that :P  Bowling against AI feels kind of frustrating at times, they seem to have a real tendency to sweep the spinners a lot even to balls pitched outside off stump and there isn't much penalty for it, not had them top edge or anything like that.  Even against pace bowlers, bowling on a good length swinging away from off stump or even just bowling seam up outside the off stump they will just fly swat it away to the leg side without much thought yet when I try it, of course I conveniently edge it straight to the slips. A little frustrating in truth.   Besides what I've said, It's honestly not a bad game if you're after a decent sim style Cricket game, It really has a lot of potential should BAS make further iterations and I certainly hope they do.
9692	1	a	Love the game. Has a great feel and the game play is fluid. Only things i would like to see added is press conferences after tests and have hotspot added
9694	1	a	A decent cricket game after a long wait....If you love cricket you cannot miss this game... The AI is super at higher levels....
9696	1	a	First of all you need a controller... Awsome game really really Mod able? if thats a word...  playing with friends really fun but laggy lol hope they fixs this for Rugby league live   Been playing cricket games since the start of cricket games this hands down is the real deal...  Have time on your side play shot's its not a slug fest   Practice practice practice

Catching animations are also a little odd especially when the wicketkeeper is catching edges istead of just taking a regulation catch they will turn their back towards the ball and somehow just dive on it but catch it nonetheless although funny I don't think we would see MS Dhoni do that :P  Bowling against AI feels kind of frustrating at times, they seem to have a real tendency to sweep the spinners a lot even to balls pitched outside off stump and there isn't much penalty for it, not had them top edge or anything like that.  Even against pace bowlers, bowling on a good length swinging away from off stump or even just bowling seam up outside the off stump they will just fly swat it away to the leg side without much thought yet when I try it, of course I conveniently edge it straight to the slips. A little frustrating in truth.   Besides what I've said, It's honestly not a bad game if you're after a decent sim style Cricket game, It really has a lot of potential should BAS make further iterations and I certainly hope they do.
9700	1	a	Great game for cricket fans. Realistic simulation and hands down the best cricket game out there right now.
9702	1	a	Best Cricket Game to Date.. mods make it much better.
9704	1	a	If you like watching people stand and watch a red ball be thrown and hit by someone else, you will enjoying.  10/10 for people watching.
9706	1	a	Greatest cricket game ever .
9708	1	a	Best cricket (possibly sports) game ever
9710	1	a	Pros  a surprisingly detailed simulation of cricket hard to master but a lot of fun when you get it right in built support for community content   Cons: more or less equally as time consuming as real cricket
9712	1	a	Best cricket (possibly sports) game ever
9714	1	a	why cant I play I n offline mode anymore?
9716	1	a	My game keeps on updating but wont launch after the update :( need help please!i kept on checking off launch game after updating but nothing happens. I've been repeating the process over and over and over again but i still keep on getting the same result sadly :(
9718	1	a	by far the best cricket game ever made.
9720	1	a	Greatest cricket game of all time.
9722	1	a	Best cricket game ever made!!!!!!!!!!!!!
9724	1	a	My game keeps on updating but wont launch after the update :( need help please!i kept on checking off launch game after updating but nothing happens. I've been repeating the process over and over and over again but i still keep on getting the same result sadly :(
9726	1	a	hey xbox 360 controoler is not working with the game please check this bug and it never get conencted with online match 
9728	1	a	how do u download the update!!!!
9730	1	a	This game is by far the best cricket game released so far.  Much better batting mechanics that actually take some timing and skill to hit the ball correctly.  Set on a higher difficulty makes hitting the ball very hard unless u get perfect timing which is what cricket is really all about.  As far as cricket games go 8/10.
9732	1	a	Whoa! Thats not how I expected a video game cricket would be.. This game is too realistic both in terms of graphics and gameplay. This is not an arcade cricket game like brianlara cricket or any other games.. Unique game simply incorporating all the skills of real cricket. Arcade players may not like this, but real cricket lovers must buy this game. Remember your pace, jump timings, swing input all matters how the ball will land [REALISTIC PHYSICS].. And this game is not a game which shows a bowler marker where the ball will land. It has everything the career, community created players, running clubs, tournaments and much more. (The reason why I have a low playing time in my profile is because you must be online to get into the game everytime. And I still have a cracked version of this game to play it offline. SUPPORT DEVELOPERS BUY ORIGINAL GAMES!!!
9734	1	a	it is nice and no bore 
9736	1	a	players not even real and when go load the game it crashes and exits??
9738	1	a	Great simulation game, best cricket game ever.

9744	1	a	Excellent game, and without a doubt the best cricket game ever made. Big Ant have obviously put their heart and soul into this game and it has payed off. The fielders may do some funky/glitchy movement at times, but nothing that disadvantages you and takes away from the game at all. Batting feels authentic and has a real learning curve if you are a cricket game veteran, bowling is well made although feels boring at times (but that may just be me). The career mode is by far the standout though. If you enjoy cricket, and enjoy gaming, definitely pick this one up. If you don't have a real interest in cricket, probably give it a miss.
9746	1	a	Firstly, kudos to Big Ant Studios for developing what is undoubtedly the finest cricket game to date.  For those of you who love cricket and have an appreciation for the nuances of the game, then I would highly recommend this title. Although there are a couple of issues which have made the game less enjoyable for me recently, on balance it is an excellent cricket simulator and Big Ant are a worthy studio who should be encouraged to continue their fine work - although this game is not perfect, my advice to the diehard cricket tragics is that Big Ant represents the best chance we will get to cricket perfection in the future. I sincerely hope they continue developing cricket games in future years.  Firstly, the positives.  Cricket is a very difficult and complex game in real life, and Don Bradman 14 has replicated this complexity in both batting and bowling. Especially on the higher difficulty levels, concentration and timing are critical. In batting, there is an excellent risk vs reward mechanism - it is possible to adopt a 'death or glory' approach in a T20 match when fast runs are required, just as it is possible to build an innings in a test match with a more sober and judicious mindset. When bowling, you will find that batsmen place a much greater value on their wicket in test matches - it is common (for me at least) to go many overs without a wicket, but when that breakthrough comes, it is tremendously satisfying. Given that test matches can go for five days in real life, I think that Big Ant has done a good job of replicating this experience within the game. Umpire decisions are imperfect, and it's possible to challenge a decision using DRS. The vast majority of times, the umpire gets it right - but I have managed to challenge successfully a couple of decisions, and this has been a great thrill.  To sum up the positives - there is a real emphasis on gameplay, and this has been executed very well. It's enough to justify the purchase of the game. I may have experienced a few gripes along the way, but the core of the game is solid, and in my opinion, this is the most important thing.  The areas to be improved?  Well, the graphics are fine, but not outstanding. Having said that, they don't detract from the experience. In-game sounds are fine but the commentary is insipid - hardly a gamebreaker, but something to be improved on in the future. (I'm also a basketball fan, and the NBA2K franchise sets the standard for commentary as far as I'm concerned). The one area I'm struggling with at the moment is the AI - I have found myself becoming increasingly more frustrated with this, particularly in short matches (ie: T20s). In my recent experience, if my T20 team bats first, they win. If they bat second, they lose. Match simulations work well for the first innings, but the AI for run chases is just appalling. It's so frustrating and disheartening when you bowl your guts out to restrict the batting team to a score of 100 to 120, only to find that your team falls ten runs short with 9 wickets in hand. Running the simulation will never get them over the line - watching the rest of the team bat is almost torture. (I remember a recent game when the two best batsmen in my T20 team needed 6 runs in the last over... they left three balls and hit the other three back to the bowler). The AI running between the wickets is incredibly risk-averse (the only run-out I've ever seen in the game has been from when I was batting myself). I'm about four years into my player's career at the moment, and these kinds of things are starting to make a big difference to my enjoyment of the game.  There is nothing I have said in the previous paragraph which has not been raised in the forums, and to give them credit, the Big Ant developers have been responsive to player concerns. Although there hasn't been a patch for a few months now, I'm hoping that the devs take all of this feedback into account for their next patch / version.  Cricket fans - there's nothing else out there which will give you the same experience as this game. Just buy it and support a team that will hopefully produce bigger and better things in the future. Well done, Big Ant - and I look forward to your future releases.
9748	1	a	Don Bradman Cricket is probably the best cricket game that I have played.    
9750	1	a	Easily the best cricket game i have played.
9752	1	a	⋆ A MUST BUY ⋆ Easily the best cricket game till date of the PC Gaming era and possibly of any era. Yes, this is very probably the finest cricket game ever made - though that's not really saying very much. With all the available features like BA Review System, complex controls, availability of variety of shots, modding possibilities and most importantly the community where you can download teams, faces etc. I strongly recommend this game.
9754	1	a	Still a few bugs in this game and no where near the quality of what the 2K sports games are but for us cricket fans this is the best we are going to get.
9756	1	a	BRILLIANT GAME, best cricket game i've ever played!
9758	1	a	This game is a tonne of fun. Some minor issues, AI being the biggest of those, but overall it's a great first iteration with hopefully more to come over the years. If you have loved cricket games in the past, you'll love this.
9760	1	a	DBC 14 rating   don bradman cricket offeres what most companies would of dreamed about its new and inovative controlling layout made the game a challenge unlike its rivals  its player creator with over 100000 cobinations made personal conections with the player and the game  unlike games before it offered a career mode where you could be what you wanted   pros  gameplay is very smooth pitch and balls have great ware models  its new controll system worked brilliantly  every shot that you see in real life is in the game their is no pitch map drs is in the game (bars)  cons  drm  comentary is really repetitive and feels clunky no licenses apart from scg and bradman croud isnt loud like at test matches  what they could add training so if you choose to attend you can you can work on your speed, catching, reactions, etc licenses    final verdict 8.5/10 the game offers a lot that the cricket fan would love
9762	1	a	One of the better sports ame on the market currently and the bestricket based game in a long long time..  If you are a cricket fan , I'd definately recommend you this game..   Sure the batting has a steep(very) learning curve but you will definately enjoy the challenge. :)
9764	1	a	thanks to the supportive staff the game runs smooth ... its the best cricket game ever!!!
9766	1	a	Incredible cricket game. Career really makes you feel every decision you make counts. Play the wrong shot, you get into trouble. Bowl wide and you are punished for 4. Fantastic.
9768	1	a	The best Cricket game yet!
9770	1	a	One of the better sports ame on the market currently and the bestricket based game in a long long time..  If you are a cricket fan , I'd definately recommend you this game..   Sure the batting has a steep(very) learning curve but you will definately enjoy the challenge. :)
9772	1	a	A Really fantastic cricket game. Great commentary, great statistic run down. very challenging a so much fun. This would be the best cricket game i have played since cricket 2007
9774	1	a	After the new update, I can now no longer player multiplayer. It starts loading then desnt load and the internet pops up and the game crashes :(
9776	1	a	played a few hours in this game this game actually can teach you how to play cricket it's a simulation you need to be very precise with your control of the anlog stick this game may not appeal to causal players even lower diffculty levels it requires concentration if it's your fantasy to face harold larwood bowling bodyline then this game is for you. i realy hope this gets VR surport like occlus rift it might make the game even better it is very hard to pick up line and length with a ball bowled without 3d suport especially in pro camera mode ive got my fingers crossed
9778	1	a	Played 170+ hours of this game, and not even anywhere near getting bored. This is a fantastic game/simulation. If you like circket and/or sports games, then this is a real gem.  Believe the hype. Buy this game, and after a few hours of playing, kiss goodbye to your life for a while. Also worth a mention. The developer is very active in the forums, and they bring out patches to improve gameplay etc. A refreshing change.
9780	1	a	I can say this thousand times but it will be less to appreciate this game. After a long time a true cricketing experience coming our way. Over all gaming expreince is new and refreshing and it makes you think about everything. There were always issues with bowling in cricket games and most of them were really bad. But in this one is a excellent approach  applied by Big Ant Games. Not only bowling looks and feeling interesting and fun, but batting is not that easy to do.  You need to play as a cricketer to enjoy the whole experience. But there are still some things which can be made better in terms of over all gaming expereice. I am sure they will be patching the bugs and make some more adjustment to enhance the game. A must buy if you have been playing crickets games all over your life. This is what you are waiting for.   Also please show your support to the team at Big Ants they have done a great job.
9782	1	a	Was a little disappointed with the need for a internet connection to play as well as requiring a Xbox Controller to play the game. As the controls ain't too complicated I've since gotten used to the controller and the graphics and realism looks good as well.   Too bad they weren't able to get actual cricketers for their commentary team though I suppose a Judo specialist and SBS soccer commentator are good enough. The customising elements of the game are great and extensive and all in all give the player the ability to play the game of cricket how, where and with who they want.   To sum it all up I would recommend this game as it is fun and to the nature of cricket there are many things that they could have improved on but Big Ant could have done a lot worse as well.
9784	1	a	Incredible cricket game. Career really makes you feel every decision you make counts. Play the wrong shot, you get into trouble. Bowl wide and you are punished for 4. Fantastic.
9786	1	a	If you like Cricket, you'll like Don Bradman's!
9788	1	a	This is a brilliant cricket game, by far the best I have played. Admittedly there aren’t many but this captures most elements of cricket well. The games been updated regularly and is well worth the time of any cricket fan.
9790	1	a	excellent cricket game, and one definitely for fans of the sport, if you've played the game or an avid fan, you won't find it all that difficult to pick up, if you haven't then you better be ready to learn as this has one hell of a steep learning curve. but once you've learned how to crack play it becomes an extremely fun game. my two complaints would be spin bowling is a little buggy depending on what controller you use, i can never get it past half way on spin, and the aspect ratio of a non standard screen doesn't seem to work
9792	1	a	One of the best game in cricket history. It includes all the modern shots and more variety in bowling as well. Thank you developers
9794	1	a	Better than any other cricket game made so far.
9796	1	a	This is an amazing game, can't wait for the new one
9798	1	a	This is the 'ACE' (Amazing Cricketing Experience) among all Cricket games out there....... ! This has raised the bar to another level and by the looks of it, it'll dominate the market for quite a LONG time.  Codemasters and EA; hope to see you soon in the contest! :D
9800	1	a	To date this has to be one of the best Cricket games I've ever played. It has its fair share of minor bugs and irritations, but overall it's a winner.   You have a lot more control over your players and with the career system in place, you have the oppurtunity to experience the fun side of a cricketer's life.  
9802	1	a	One of the best cricket games I have played.
9804	1	a	The BEST cricket game
9806	1	a	Yes, this is surely a must by game if you love playing cricket, enjoy playing cricket or simply if you are a die hard fan of cricket... It has been a long wait for a descent cricket game with updated roosters...cunning AI ... The important thing they keep updating their game very often .... Tweaking every possible aspects... making the game closer to reality.... It may be a bit difficult in the early days....but well we can only get good if we practise right.... 
9808	1	a	excellent cricket game, and one definitely for fans of the sport, if you've played the game or an avid fan, you won't find it all that difficult to pick up, if you haven't then you better be ready to learn as this has one hell of a steep learning curve. but once you've learned how to crack play it becomes an extremely fun game. my two complaints would be spin bowling is a little buggy depending on what controller you use, i can never get it past half way on spin, and the aspect ratio of a non standard screen doesn't seem to work
9810	1	a	Best CRICKET GAME till now . It has very modding support, after patching it looks great. Dont think just grab it.
9812	1	a	Great Game good gameplay. very realistic only the ambience and feel of ground is a bit mellow. Waiting for Don bradman 17 hopefully it will have pumped up audience in the IPL and limited over fixtures.
9814	1	a	great cricket game...better than it;s present counterparts.....already invested 158 hours and looking forward to spend more...
9816	1	a	This game is truly special if you're a cricket fan! its not perfect but considering the budget it was on it is really good, if you dont know much about cricket and you want to learn the rules this game is for you aswell! I highly reccomend this game for anybody with an interest in cricket!
9818	1	a	Damn, seems like getting 1200 runs in an ODI is gonna be a bit tougher than ashes 2009 But seriously 10/10
9820	1	a	I liked it but its working slowly means it stucks littlebit littlebit
9822	1	a	OF all the Cricket video games that I have played and believe me I played pretty much everything out there, this one is by far the best, most detailed and most realistic experience that I have had. If you are a true cricket fan, then you must give this game a shot for you will be addicted to getting better at this game! The Career mode and customization options are fantastic! You can download the official team rosters from the internet made by the community to make your experience even better! GO Get THIS GAME!
9824	1	a	Probably the best PC cricket game I have ever played over the past 30+ years of playiing cricket games. Has everything and more a cricket fan could possible want. Stats galore, customization galore, creating your own players, team, comps, etc. Runs perfectly with controllers in big picture mode. Bit of a learning curve to get the hang of it, the more you play the better you will get at it. Great fun coop play in bigpicture mode on a big tv with wireless controllers.  Not much else you could ask for from a cricket game. The commentary is good and not annoying. Fielding is alright, but still getting use to it. If you going to buy a cricket game, this is the one to buy. Bowling takes a while to get use to and still getting use to it, but getting better. No regrets even for the price. Worth every penny. Can't wait till i really sink my teeth into playing the game when i have time.
9826	1	a	Beware non Cricket lovers, this game is addictive. You might just become a fan of the best sport ever by playing this. There is more that just technology in this masterpiece. I am a real life Cricket coach and I am thinking of using this game as a tool to develop a 'feel' for the game.  Prior knowledge of Cricket will help you to develop and 'grow' quicker to higher levels but you can still begin as a novice and grow into it. It will take a lot of dedication though.   DBC is a challenge, not for sissy boys. It give you a real feeling of real Cricket. Thank You DBC Boys.
9828	1	a	Probably the greatest cricket game ever or maybe the only cricket game out there :3 GO GET IT IF YOU'RE A DIE HARD CRICKET FAN.
9830	1	a	The BEST cricket game
9832	1	a	This is the best cricket game I have ever played. Must buy, must play.
9834	1	a	The best cricket game but need to add keyboard controls.Its difficult to learn bowling but batting is ok.Need some more realism in IA like when left handed batsman come you should go with offspinner.In test matches batsmen play too aggresively with ODI strike rate and this needs a fix.Career mode is unrealistic as my player play every matches.The player should be dropped if is out of form and should get injured sometimes.
9836	1	a	The best cricket game you can buy. Full featured, career mode is excellent, and batting / bowling very satisfying.   The demo doesn't give you a full understanding of the product, so just go ahead a buy it, you won't be dissappointed!
9838	1	a	Probably the greatest cricket game ever or maybe the only cricket game out there :3 GO GET IT IF YOU'RE A DIE HARD CRICKET FAN.
9840	1	a	So far the best experience and variety in Cricket games. Big Ant Studio did great job. high hopes from 2017 edition. this is a must play for Sports &amp; Cricket lover!!
9842	1	a	This is the 'ACE' (Amazing Cricketing Experience) among all Cricket games out there....... ! This has raised the bar to another level and by the looks of it, it'll dominate the market for quite a LONG time.  Codemasters and EA; hope to see you soon in the contest! :D
9844	1	a	I don't have too many hours played on the PC version but don't be fooled because I originally bought the game on Xbox 360 the day before official release day when the street date got broken and I've played this game a lot.  This is without a doubt the best cricket game since Shane Warne Cricket 99 and it looks so much BETTER on PC and to be honest it's probably deserving of the best cricket game ever.  I will say that bowling on higher difficulty levels can be more of a chore than a fun time and there, for me anyway, hasn't been that breakthrough from difficulty to enjoyment like there was when batting finally clicked, but I rectify this by batting as both teams and I have an amazing time.  Batting is amazing once it finally clicks, and there is a bit of a learning curve especially if you jump straight in to pro, but it will come eventually after some frustrating times. Don't let challenge mean there is no enjoyment though, in career mode I was celebrating 20 runs like I scored a century and nothing felt as good as the first 50 and then 100.  There is an amazing modding community over at planet cricket and if you're a retro lover like I am or just want the latest kits and bat sponsorship go over there right now and spend a bit of time getting the mods in to your game because the immersion that the mods brings takes this already fantastic game to a whole new level. Sometimes I just scan around the ground in awe at how great it looks.  My Career is a great addition but it is a little barebones. That's not to say it isn't fun but don't expect NBA 2K level of career either.  9/10 simply because nothing is perfect but this comes close. A must have for any cricket lover.
9846	1	a	great cricket game...better than it;s present counterparts.....already invested 158 hours and looking forward to spend more...
9848	1	a	great cricket game highly recamended
9850	1	a	The best cricket game I have ever played and I\'ve played them all. When there were issues early on with the game, the devs were very responsive.  I\'m still playing it 2 years later and still love it. Would recommend for a big cricket fan or someone who has no idea what cricket is.  It\'s quite hard at first, even on the easiest difficulty but stick with it and you will love it.
9852	1	a	since brian lara cricket 1995 sega and playstaion version , I have been played almost all cricket games so far (including all ea ones ) yes ea 1999 (most pathetic one) too :) but never seen such quality cricket game as dbc 2014 is all about   DBC 2014 is something special yes, beautifully designed , excellent gameplay . even after playing for more than 100 hrs still i am unable to play pro difficulty . online gameplay ofcourse much better than other shi**** games as well.  top 3 cricket games i would say so far as follows   1. DBC 2k14 2. BLC 2k7 3. Ashes 2k9   for all cricket lovers , its my request please buy original copy . come on , within 499 INR you cant get better than this.   eagerly waiting for dbc 2k17  
9854	1	a	Best Cricket simulation game available on the market.
9856	1	a	One of the best PC CRICKET GAMES. EAGERLY EAITING FOR DON BRADMAN 17
9858	1	a	Amazing Game. Best Cricket game of all time.
9860	1	a	Best cricket gamew yet. Would like to see DRS updated to match new DRS for ball tracking.
9862	1	a	Best Cricket game of this gen. Great to see the Cricket games coming back, it still is not in the league of FIFA or Madden, but its polish and attention to detail is great and will appeal to cricket fans. After playing for a while, you do see the limitations and rough edges, but overall a great experience for cricket fans.
9864	1	a	Amazing Game. Best Cricket game of all time.
9866	1	a	Put simply, Don Bradman is a fantastic cricket game, the best one I've played since Cricket 07. (And Aussie made!)  What it lacks in graphics and repetitive commentary is made up for by a deep batting and bowling system, alongside the community mods that allow real teams to be seamlessly incorporated.   Career mode is basic, and you never get moved up or down the order, but hopefully will be fixed in DBC17!  If you love cricket, buy this game.
9868	1	a	Blood Bowl is a...How to put this? Turn based fantasy sport satire boardgame? It's quite unique, and I have difficulty describing it in a simple way so I will explain the gameplay  You have a team of 11-16 pieces(Your players), and you face off against a team of similar size. Only up to 11 per team can be on the field at once. It is vaguely remniscent of American Football(Handegg for you Europeans out there), where you have a ball and you need to run it into your opposition's endzone to score. Different from the sport however is that you take turns moving your pieces.  This leads to a more strategic and tactical game, with the dice-based mechanics making it mainly a challenge of risk avoidance, while maximising the risk for your opponent.  Of course, being a Warhammer universe, there are races other than humans. And everything is much more violent. It is not unusual for a team to have players die on the field, or to have them permanently injured. And tactics are much less throwing balls and passing for the less dextrous races(Orks tend to not have a great catcher for one, and the passing game of a dwarf team is notorious for being poor), and more other things. Stalling, outmanouvering your opponent, or just plainly trying to beat them all to a pulp and walk right through them are options. There are plenty of tactical choices to be made, and several strategic ones as well - A team can last you a very long time, and knowing how to build the skills on your team is crucial to your success in the later matches.  In the end, it is a very interesting game. It has a little something for everyone, from amazing comebacks out of a long pass by an elf team to the pure carnage of a band of orks having themselves a good old brawl while there just happens to be a ball in the mix somewhere, to entirely other playstyles entirely. While often I think of something to say that would let you know whether or not you'll like it, the only way to know for sure with Bloodbowl is to try.  It's very hit and miss. If you end up enjoying it, you can get a long, long time out of your money. And if not, well. It was cheap(If you got it on sale), and you tried.  And even then, it's a great game to play with a friend while just talking or doing something else on the side.    Blood Bowl Chaos edition includes all content of Legendary edition.  New in Chaos edition are three new teams/races you can pick, none of them overpowered so you are not buying power here, while at the same time being 100% compatible with Legendary edition. There are extra voice lines, a new stadium, and a new price tag! Buying Chaos edition gets you all the content in Legendary as well, so you can consider it the 'full edition' at this point. (Before Bloodbowl 2 anyway) Is it worth a whole 10 bucks more? Up to you. But do know that during sales it is often available for a much cheaper price, a total of 7,50 seems to be customary.  Worth it on sale? You bet it is. Worth it for everyone? As before, maybe. But I do recommend giving it a try just in case you like it. Because if you do, you'll wonder where the hours went, and why the sun is coming up already.   I highly recommend Cknoor and his group for both learning to play, finding the fun in the game if you're not sure on what to amuse yourself with, and finding people to play with   http://steamcommunity.com/groups/cknoorbowl 
9870	1	a	10/10 awesome game. If you enjoyed this on the tabletops as much as I did, it's a no-brainer. If you've never played the board version of this game it's definitely worth picking up in a sale. it's one of those quick-to-pick-up games with some interesting challenges in 'story' mode, but the real game is mastered in the online leagues. There are a number of leagues available from the beginners league to the specialities like 'no bash' (where 'bashy' races such as Orc and Dwarf are not allowed entry). Which means that you will be sure to find a match to suit you for style and player experience. On top of that of course there are Private Leagues. If you have a group of friends looking to find a good fun 2-player game which runs 1-2 hours then look no further.  One last thing: In some sale conditions it can work out cheaper to buy Legendary edition AND Chaos edition than it is to buy Chaos Edition by itself.
9872	1	a	This game is a conversion of the classic Blood Bowl tabletop game. It takes the rules that required hours upon hours of bickering in real life to being automatically resolved. This saves you quite a bit of frustration, even if the dice rolls will still make your perfect team die horribly at the game's whim. If you liked the board game, you will like this game.  However, if you haven't played the board game, it's an acquired taste. You'll need to be able to accept that your rolls will dictate your fate, that your best player, that you've built up with the best possible upgrades, can die at any time, and that even if you play with perfect strategy, some times you will fail anyway. It's a brutal system, but it can provide a lot of long-term satisfaction if you have the patience for it.  Note: (The game is way more fun to play with a group of friends in tournament mode)
9874	1	a	I had the legendary edition previously and was holding out for BloodBowl 2. I was disappointed with what i saw and even more disappointed with the wave upon wave of issues Blood Bowl 2 has.   At 75% off I was convinced that I might as well finally opt for Chaos edition as I had always wanted to play chaos dwarfs anyway. Initially I was put off by 'made-up' new teams but the Khorne and Underworld teams add some variety that remains balanced in line with others.   Rest of the additions is simply more of what we had before.....  If you want to get into Blood Bowl then by far your best option is to ignore 2 and get Chaos edition of Blood Bowl 1. If you have either of other versions of Blood Bowl 1, then stick with what you've got unless you REALLY want to play one of the 3 new teams.  I loved Blood Bowl on tabletop and this version of the game is the best available! Highly recommended!
9876	1	a	I started the North American TTS League and even after giving up being the commissioner I still cast games of Blood Bowl from them. This is a true to life adaptation of the Blood Bowl board game and will not disappoint you fans out there.   However for folks that don't know anything about the game, there is a LARGE learning curve that even single player still doesn't teach you correctly.   Here's the most recent game from the NATTS league and see for yourself:   http://youtu.be/aPM5vwg2WLE 
9878	1	a	Blood Bowl: Chaos Edition is a fantasy football video game with the option for turn based or real time game play. This game is an expansion to Blood Bowl that was developed in 2009 by Cyanide and published Focus Home Interactive and is based on the board game 'Blood Bowl' that is produced by Games Workshop.  Blood Bowl: Chaos Edition has a great variety of game modes available for both single player and multiplayer that will keep you entertained for days providing the dice gods don't come down on you too harshly. It is however recommended that you play using Classic mode and playing using turn based due to the fact that blitz mode is an awful edition to the game since it does not fit in well and functions clumsily.  There are a 23 races to choose from in Blood Bowl chaos edition and helps to add a nice variety to the teams you come up against, some races share similar players but overall there is a lot to choose from and picking what team you want to play as can take quite some time.  Blood Bowl: Chaos Editions graphics are perfectly suitable for what it is trying to achieve and generally looks visually pleasing and adds a fair amount of detail into the surroundings and units, for a game made in 2009 you defiantly can't complain.  On lower difficulty settings the AI make irrational moves that tend to lead to costly mistakes, while the higher levels of AI provide some challenge but you most likely will want to look for opposition using multiplayer.  If you want a faithful recreation of the board game Blood Bowl this is the only video game you should currently choose to try out due to the fact that it is quite high quality and is a quite compelling experience overall. I highly recommend that you give this game a try if you like a challenging board game-esque strategy game.  Rating - 8 - A must buy!   Advantages  - Compelling Game play  - Lots of variety - The best of its kind on the market   Disadvantages - Irrational AI at lower difficulties
9880	1	a	Only sports game i care about.   I think it's a sport...   I mean, there is a ball if you feel the need to push it around.  Oh and cheerleaders!  Who would bring cheerleaders to an execution!?  Unless it was a sport right!!?
9882	1	a	Rather than going for an re-interpretation of the Warhammer table-top game (Dawn of War), this game takes the Warhammer Fantasy football game 'Blood Bowl' and ports it perfectly onto PC. The game itself plays a lot like chess, with a turn based system in which one team attempts to score as many goals as possible (as you'd expect). The difference between Blood Bowl and an ordinary game of football, however, lies in the fact you can maim, bribe and murder the other team if you so desire, making for some intersting matches to say the least. The selection of teams is diverse, with each having their unique feel and playstyle instead of just being re-skins of the same team. If you're considering getting into the tabletop version, I most certainly recommend playing this first as it can teach you the basics of the game and is incredibly fun to play with friends.  Don't enable the real-time option if you value your sanity.
9884	1	a	This game is brutal. It will kick you in the balls after hitting you in the face with a bat covered in broken glass and rusty nails time and time again. but you will come back. Read the game rules, and play the tutorial.
9886	1	a	My star human blitzer tripped over his own shoes and died  RIP dumbass
9888	1	a	A great adaptation of the classic GW board game.  With Chaos edition we have 3 new teams added: Underworld, Daemons of Khorne and finally Chaos Dwarves. Underworld are a real blast to play and with easy access to mutations can be a really visually pleasing team to play. Khorne Daemons can be quite tricky to play due to a high concentration of frenzy on their players but can really be bashy and have the best Big Guy in the game in their Bloodthirster.  Overall pretty fun especially amongst friends although the RNG can be a bit extreme in it's results
1419	0	a	My old review for this was positive. And it technically still is. Blood Bowl is a great game. The underlying mechanics are great, and Chaos Edition was, even with the release of BB2, the definitive edition of the game.  Keyword was. With the release of BB2 we saw a slow downward spiral of the MP community, to the point where today, the only action going on in BB1, either CE or Legendary, is in scheduled organized leagues. As such I cannot reccomend BB1 to a new player. BB2 may be a steep ask what with the lesser amount of teams, but it's where most of the pickup MP community has gone. There also is the freeware alternative called FUMBBL, that's 2d and java based. Both are a far better option than BB1 now for actual MP.  Ordinarily I would not go an remove and change the thumb to a down for a game simply because of the MP community drying up, but for Blood Bowl the entirety of the game is both MP, and has moved on to a nearly identical platform as well at that, and thus I feel obliged to steer people to those two alternatives, either the updated retail version, or the smaller, more hardcore community of the freeware game.
9890	1	a	I HATE THIS GAME!!!!! why you might ask? its because I stink at dice games. I have been cursed by the gaming gods so that I only can throw bad rolls of the dice. This is why I HATE this game because it´s so funny to play and is well made, but I keep getting bad rolls so I keep screaming in my head, 'WHY THE HELL DO I KEEP COMMING BACK TOO THIS GAME!?!?!?'  I keep coming back because the teams are interesting, the gameplay and meckanic is supreme and it is easy to learn. But if you have a short fuse when it comes to dice games, then maybe you should look somewhere else (it is to late for me). for when you start playing, you keep coming back for more punishment and hopes for glory.
9892	1	a	I'm a huge fan of this game - get it and I'll definitely be up for playing with you whenever I have time. It will initially take some effort to learn the rules, but once you have, many hours of ridiculously fun strategising lie in wait. It's a deep game that rewards thinking ahead and adapting your tactics to your opponent. If this sounds like your thing, buy it!
1420	0	a	I really like this game and i think that this version is bettern than the others, even better then the last one (BB2).  I'm not complaining about the difficult or the game balance that i find acceptable.  But there is a bug that completely ruins the SP experience and that developer have always refused to fix: during the AI vs AI match simulations, there are no deaths or injuries!  Because of this and also for the very poor comunication between developers and users (Cyanide Studios completely ignore users) i put a negative review that i will change for sure when that bug will be fixed...but i think that Cyanide Studios is too busy selling BB2 dlcs instead of fix this...
9894	1	a	Blood Bowl: CE is a game for fans of the miniatures game. If your looking for a football simulator this is not it. Turn based is still the best way to play this.
9896	1	a	Once you get past the dregs of online matchmaking and join one of the four or five very active communities with organised tourneys and leagues, blood bowl online becomes a very enjoyable experience. This is the edition that has everything and I heartily recommend it.  If you do play it, I recommend reading the rulebook (just google blood bowl rulebook). Although the game generally works very well, it's much more enjoyable when you sit yourself down to the actual rules. It's a little bit of work, but these rules were honed through years of playtesting and active experience and what has come out makes sure that every game is exciting, unpredictable and challenging. Above all it's a game that teaches one to learn to deal with the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ situations you can be put in or marvel at the gutsy gambles that have paid off.  Not recommended for people that dislike chance as a whole; you can minimize the risk to a great amount and the winner of league is generally the better player, but the winner of a match is sometimes decided by the dice gods.  My very first game my most expensive player was hit and killed by a rock thrown by the audience; before I had even made a single decision. If that kind of thing sounds like fun, this game might be for you.
9898	1	a	BB has its bugs (still). BB has a horribly atrocious UI (especially in online multiplayer/league management). It may take a while to figure out how to even get to play a match. I haven't given the real-time mode much of a chance, but I haven't heard good things. Oh and let's not forget the single player AI is pretty terrible. Any veteran of turn-based strategy games   With all that ugly. This game is one of my top 10 games. I would expect most turn-based strategy players to really enjoy this game. The strategy and depth between teams while maintaining balance is fantastic. I suppose that happens when a game's rules have been evolved over decades. Setup a league with a few friends, and you will find your group endlessly discussing tactics.  Be forewarned! Everyone's luck sucks in the game! It is maddening and frustratingly awesome. I constantly swear that the RNG gods are against me in every match. It is a game of weighted risk management. As your team evolves, new unique dynamics to your team emerge. It gives every team a personality. You will have some pretty big emotional highs and lows every time your team steps onto the pitch!
9900	1	a	If you are into complex boardgames that involve strategy as well as risk-managing, this game is for you. Thought the UI could use some work, the team persistence and management along with the matches offer an addictive experience.
9902	1	a	It's bloodbowl. There is no substitute. It's a fantasy warhammer sports football game. I've been playing this game since the 90s (boardgame) and if you have not played it you are missing out.  Pros It's bloodbowl like the board game and easier to get a game with a real person  Cons It can be RTS, but why bother snow based football pitches make it hard to see - chat is invisible on snow actions by the opposing side knock you out of the chat box Lady luck sometimes does not favour me :o( Boo Hoo  Someone asked is this like playing the real thing. The answer is yes.
9904	1	a	This is a pretty good game; it's rather an improvement to the first Blood Bowl.  If you've played the first Blood Bowl, you're in for no surprises, just some new teams.   The single-player portion is fun, but the AI is rather too easy to be useful practise for multiplayer.
1421	0	a	Make absolutely sure you're okay with a game completely screwing you by RNG over and over and over and over again before making this purchase. Even if you play perfectly and make every objectively correct move while playing, the game will still roll 1s which will still guarantee failure of your plays. The offline AI is flawed to make it poor for practice, because while it is brutal the only recommendations by players online is to exploit a few flaws in it that make it predictable and easily beaten rather than having you learn good strategy.  Other than that, it's an okay game. Not worth the money, though. If you really need to scratch that Blood Bowl itch,  FUMBBL.com  doesn't have the uncommon bug this game tends to have and plays with the exact same rules with even more player activity even during non-peak hours.
9906	1	a	Great adaptation of the board game, has all teams available to play with. Even though BB2 has been out for a while, teams are being put out as DLC rather than being in the base game, which is why I consider this the current definitive digital version of Blood Bowl.
1422	0	a	Love the concept (I loved the board game version), execution is poor and buggy. How difficult would it be to transpose a well loved procedural boardgame into a computer game? As with many games the developer should have spent money on AI rather than fancy, generally unused, features. I hear on-line is where its at, but single player doesn't stand up
9908	1	a	You would never think a game like this can make you so emotional. The joy of the double Go-For-It! touchdown without a re-roll. The Fury of rolling four attacker downs at the begining of your turn. The fear of losing you star player to a pitch invasion. The unrelenting sadness of said star player getting killed by a blitzing Orge...  Sorry, got off topic. This is literal fantasy football, with everything that entails. Teams consist of Elves, Dwarves, and other fantasy staples. Wizards are hurling spells onto the field. Blood and limbs flying as teams of heavily armed and armored individuals try to move the ball down the field.  The game has a handful of different modes where you can make a team take them through competitions. It also supports exporting the team you create to use in exhibition matches. Where this game shines, however, is online play. Get a group of friends together and start a league. Revel as your chainsaw wielding goblin takes out that annoying guy from chemistry's reciever. Laughs will be had, tears will be shed, and there is a good chance someone will die on the field.  That's Blood Bowl.
9910	1	a	This game is like Rugby or american football where you run or pass the ball down the field to make a goal, but it can be a bit random as dice are rolled for somethings and then murphy's law takes over... That being said, Blood bowl chaos ed brings out my competetive spirit out with horns....I have join 2 leagues and about to join a third, you can take some very cheap shots at the other coaches players and if they go down and the ref is not looking he he it can be fun being mean.... Blood bowl chaos ed is set in the warhammer world and this version has 23 different teams, Blood Bowl 2 does not have that many even if you buy all the DLC's But it is prettier and is more bone crushing on the tackle and block. there are several options of play for single play, story , campaign, competition and world cup, you can do hot seat or online play or local area network for multiplayer if you play on line you will have to join a league and play and that can be a lot of fun...and lastly, this game sales for less than 8$ when on sale
9912	1	a	This game is a strategy sportsgame with manager and roguelike and tabletop elements that has even a deep and tricky multiplayer. It's very good for what it is, but it is strange. If you are into strange strategy games (like me), this might be a gem to you.
9914	1	a	Don't let the sports theme fool you: this is a hardcore tabletop-based wargame in which everything from your overarching gameplan down to the mere sequence in which you move your players can spell the difference between victory and defeat.  THE GOOD +The rules are easy to understand at the basic level, with the more complex players' skills adding depth as your team progresses. +Excellent sense of progression in watching your players gain experience and acquire new skills that let you custom-tailor your team. +An amusing tongue-in-cheek universe that provides outstanding fluff to the game. +Dozens of premade teams that allow you to jump right into the action if you don't feel like dealing with the aspects of managing your own. +An inducement system that keeps games between teams of different developmental levels competitive, without completely negating the advantages of a well-developed squad.  THE BAD -The game seems tailored for those experienced with the tabletop version, resulting in a rather lackluster tutorial. Though it does an adequate job of teaching the mechanics of the game, you're mostly left on your own to figure out the best ways to make use of those mechanics. You should look up fansites to read up on some effective tactical doctrines if you don't feel like learning through trial-and-error. Fortunately, they're easy to find. -Missing some of the races from the current version of the tabletop rules, as well as a large number of Star Players (special players you can hire to play for your team for one game only, usually as part of the inducement system).  THE MIXED *Only marginal in terms of balance. There's a great amount of customization that lets you remain competitive, but there are some skills that are just flat-out better than others, and some races that have intrinsic advantages over others. *There's in-game announcing, fitting with its sports theme, but limited variety means you'll be hearing the same things over and over before long. Still, I like hearing the announcers, because they give some amusing anecdotes from and comments on the universe's rich fluff and history. *The game sticks rather faithfully to the tabletop rules, which means many things from success or failure on the field to a degree of player progression are determined by dice rolls. This can be alternatingly thrilling and frustrating, and although the random aspects aren't enough to negate skill, it's important to remember that nothing is ever certain in Blood Bowl. *Player turnover. Some people like constantly raising new players, while others may be upset when their star player dies. Don't get too attached to your players, because the game is called Blood Bowl for a reason. *The sheer number of player skills, while good in the long run, can be a bit overwhelming at first until you've managed to memorize what they all do and how to take advantage of them. *The many different races, while each offering unique roster possibilities, tend to fall broadly into variations of 2-4 general playstyles rather than each offering truly unique gameplay opportunities.  CONCLUSION If you like turn-based strategy games, this is an easy recommendation. If you like turn-based strategy games, bloody carnage, and a rich, amusing setting, this is a must-have.
9916	1	a	The dice are exceedingly unforgiving. My paranoia wants to suggest that the RNG's been messed with to have 1s on 50% of the rolls (this isn't true). If you can put up with the annoyance of rolling 1s on every other roll and having your star players die at every turn, then this is a nice little smash up of combat football and chess.   If Nuffle chooses his favorite and it's not you, prepare to lose to scores like 5-0 and 6-0.
9918	1	a	Does two or more of these statements correspond to you?   You dislike games which are almost entirely based on luck.   You aren't prepared to spend hours on end trying to understand the game concepts.   You dislike games where the AI players are so stupid that the developers made them cheat.   You think balance* in games is important.   You aren't good at chess.   You dislike games where the only option to get better is to get your behind handed to you whilst playing online matches.   You are not a stubborn fool.   Then this game probably is not for you.  But if you are prepared to spend the time required and see past the difficult learning curve. Blood Bowl, when everything works** is great fun!  The down side with this game is that it is biased towards people who used to play the table top variant, and you gain nothing trying to get better whilst playing the AI as they're cheating with dice rolls.  *Teams &amp; players. **You aren't plagued by skull dices, or fail tackles or failing other actions which MUST work!
9920	1	a	Nothing is more fun than getting your superstar thrower killed by a really lucky goblin fouling you on the last turn of the game. 10/10
9922	1	a	Are you not entertained?  I knew what I was signing up for - I'd played the board game, over and over, and loved it. This is merely the PC port of a boardgame, so don't expect fancy game mechanics. This still is good old dice-rolling, only computerized. So Create your team, recruit your players, name them, cherish them, anguish at their injuries and revel in their successes!  Obviously, this makes the game a bit of an acquired taste. If you already have a firm grasp of the rules, this'll be a breeze to understand and play. If not... get ready to wrap your head-meat around some game core mechanics!  A must for fans.  
9924	1	a	Outstanding port over from the board game to PC. I remember many years ago being in a league with an undead team with the board game. What joy i had painlessly painting my figures so they looked ubah against other teams. Then the beauty of technology comes along and i get to play Blood Bowl on my computer oh what joy!! and i must say how bloody cool it is too. Love the commentators in the game Jim the Vampire and Bob the Ogre they really bring a fun element to the game even though i do wish they recorded more voiceovers as they can get a bit repetative which does get annoying.. Other annoying thing is the Ref he does like to send players off the field even with a bribe.. Why?? i only stood on his head!! :P   All in all if you love the fantasty element and warhammer style universe and want to enjoy it in a sport styled enviroment then this game is for you!!! you dont really need to know anything about american football or rubgy just remember the following:- Kick off, kick the crap out of the oposing team.. pass the ball if you want to or just get it to the oponents end zone to score.. i myself enjoy the fighting and seeing how many kills my Murdering Hillbilly Team can do in a course of a match :P  10/10
9926	1	a	Even though I'm not much into american football, this is pretty straight forward. Beat the sh*t out of the other team and try to stop them from scoring a touchdown. The more violence - the better. Nothing like breaking the bones of the enemy player and making him sit out rest of the match or injure him permanently that will affect him for the rest of the career. With good luck, you can even injure the players fatally which will impact hugely on the team's wallet and future gameplays.  Only rule is to not beat the unconscious players lying on ground or use weapons... Though you can always try bribing the judges if get caught!   In turn based mode the suspense get's pretty high and I really like pimping out my players with more skills and mutations. I just gave my minotaur a third arm to help him catch and throw ball better - and second head to let him see better and dodge more efficiently!   'Here comes the freak show!'
9928	1	a	The best installment of this great game. The turn-by-turn version of the game is a faithful re-creation of one of my favorite Games Workshop miniature games. 23 playable races each with a different strategy for winning games. The new single player cup system is great too.
9930	1	a	Blood Bowl: Chaos Edition isn't much different from the Legendary Edition, though I understand most people recommend buying Chaos Edition if you haven't purchased either. They have some extra races included.  Blood Bowl is Games Workshop's blend of American Football and Rugby, and is a faithful recreation of the tabletop boardgame. Pick a race, recruit players, and have them all killed on the field by Chaos Dwarves during your first game.  BB is arbitrary, with good strategy only able to minimize the punishing dice rolls. Embrace the chaotic nature of your plans going awry, your Catcher with Sure Hands, Nerves of Steel, and Block dying at the hands of a zombie because you rolled 3 skulls and have no team re-rolls left, and watching a Gutter Runner go nearly the length of the entire field to score.  Because if you're lucky, you'll catch that little rat on the next play and break his neck, ending his career forever.  Not for the faint of heart or those who care that the dice are brutal and don't care about you.  For: people who enjoy NFL Blitz, watching Orcs beat down hapless Wood Elves, and anyone who can handle losing because the dice didn't go your way. Lots of fun.
9932	1	a	Roll the dice and cry a bit.
9934	1	a	This is a very entertaining game that has a long term game playability. Unlike many games where you get to the end and your at a loss on what to do next. Blood Bowl lets you move to multi player and begin playing others. It has a good system for multiplayer to learn more advanced game theory beyond what the AI can teach you. It also gives you a chance to begin play in leagues and develop longer term and more developed teams. I love this game and expect to for a long time.
9936	1	a	This is a very entertaining game. While there are multiple die rolls on any given action, that doesn't mean the it's all luck. There are plenty of tactics and strategy on and off the field ('the pitch') that will make the difference between a successful franchise and an also-ran.
9938	1	a	A fairly faithful representation of the great board game. The computer AI is pretty poor but good enough to help beginners before the move on to real life opponents (either online or for the board game).  The bonus for the Chaos Edition over Blood Bowl 2 is that it has all the playable races.  Overall definitely worth getting if you ever enjoyed the board game.
9940	1	a	Best electronic version of the table top game.
9942	1	a	Great game and as amusing as the tabletop. I am impressed with how well they kept to the game I have enjoyed for years.
9944	1	a	Really fun game if you take the time to learn and understand the rules.
9946	1	a	I have enjoyed playing this. If you are a fan of the original TT game then you will slot right into this. The only cautionary word i would use is... patience. Your success will be bought with stunning plays, clever dummies, intelligent blocking and you will know  the joy of seeing it come together... sometimes ;). The whole thing comes down to the dice. Accept that, be aware it might have you leaping for joy one minute and tearing out your hair the next and you will be fine. Enjoy !
9948	1	a	It's amazing how many people a troll can murder.
9950	1	a	Amazingly frustraiting but amazingly brilliant! Turn based American football with orcs and ogres whats not to like :-)
9952	1	a	A good tactical turn based strategy which is ultimately a fun game yet has the potential to be very frustrating since a lot of it boils down to chance, the roll of the dice and the somewhat unbalanced teams can easily ruin your day if you're not very lucky.
9954	1	a	Having played the beta of the original Blood Bowl when it first came out, I wasn't massively impressed with it, and left it a long time before considering again. When the Chaos edition went on sale for £5, I spent a while trying to decide whether it was worth the gamble, and it turns out it was.  First things first, it's important to note that this is a dice-based game, so there are going to be stretches where you get a run of bad rolls and lose to teams you should beat, players die from tripping over their own feet and falling over, and you can't pass the ball three yards under no pressure whatsoever. Once you're past the luck-based side of things, this is a pretty faithful rendition of the Blood Bowl boardgame, albeit without the need for a mountain of paper and three hours to finish a match. Each side has their own strengths and weaknesses (although team balance is a little screwy - there's not much reason to choose outside of 5 or so teams of the 20+ available, that's Games Workshop's error, not Cyanide who developed the videogame version), and there should be a side to suit most playstyles, from 'pass it around' to 'kill the other guys, we'll worry about the ball later'.  Overall, it's not going to blow anyone away, but if you're looking for a nice sports game with a twist, or you like the concept of Blood Bowl but don't have/want to spend all afternoon shuffling bits of paper, this could be a good buy.
9956	1	a	All of my friends want me to stop talking about Blood Bowl.  I will never stop talking about Blood Bowl.  Go Desert Wraiths.
9958	1	a	Amazingly frustraiting but amazingly brilliant! Turn based American football with orcs and ogres whats not to like :-)
9960	1	a	This game is infuriating! Sometimes for you, sometimes for your opponent. Take some time to learn how it works and have fun for months.

9964	1	a	In this game, RNG ♥♥♥♥s you in the ♥♥♥.  9/10 would play again
9966	1	a	After countless hours of playing this game, i just keep playing. It will make you very happy sometimes and some times you just want to kill whoever you are playing aginst. but the fun is still there!
9968	1	a	Great and addictaing, but can ♥♥♥♥ you off
9970	1	a	It's hard to get into but when you do it is a really nice and rewarding game
9972	1	a	This is a hard game to recommend to anyone. Every time I start describing the experience of carefully selecting a team, training them, picking a sponsor and selecting your per-game bribes people get excited. Then people hear that in every match there's a chance that your entire team will be injured or killed after gaining valuable experience points. People's eyes tend to glaze over at this point.  It's the violence and death that make the multiplayer and campaign so good. You know that every match will be brutal and chance as much as skill will turn the tide of victory. Seeing the crowd turn on your opponent to tear them to shreds on a bad play or watching your own blocker critically fail a roll and bounce off the other teams ball carrier like the dude is made of force fields are just flipsides of the same coin.  You can be good at this game or bad. Awesome or terrible. In the end this game is like all true Games Workshop titles. Skill is irrelevant. The fun is in the stories you get to tell later about the crazy stuff that happened on the dice rolls and how they played out. Play it with friends or enemies or the exceptionally active Blood Bowl community on Steam if you like, but understand that winning and losing aren't super important. It's all about how the game plays you.
9974	1	a	fun game, just like the bordgame from the past, just way bether, fun even the storymode
9976	1	a	A must have for any stratagy game player. Sure sometimes a bad dice on a perfectly good plan can be frusturating but at the end of the day that's Blood Bowl. Saddly it does have it's gliches at time but when you play the game long enough you can learn how to advoid them. I give this game a solid 8/10
9978	1	a	This game is all about tipping dice in your favor. If you suck at luck, this game might not be for you.It is a pretty fun turn based fantasy football brawl stratagy game aside from a few seemingly OP races. I guess that's expected because there's 23 races, even though a few only feature 2 units. I'm nit sure how to end this review. Ceaser Salad.
9980	1	a	If you liked the tabletop game, then you might well enjoy this. It has all the teams you ever knew, and some you may have missed. You can play with the rules you're familiar with (or try alternative modes of play). Can play against AI that isn't totally bereft of ability nor relies on fudged dice. Could always join an online league to go against other actual human players. Rather spiffing. I'm not sure how intuitive it would be to someone that hadn't learnt the game on the tabletop though, I suspect the range of available skills might be overwhelming and confusing, could download the free rulebook as reference to offset such issues.
9982	1	a	Absolutely faithful to the table top version. A fun miniture game that you can pick up, play a match or tqo, and put down in under an hour.
9984	1	a	An effective rendering of the board game. Not especially pretty, or interesting, but it does all you'd want it too. A solid port, if you will.
9986	1	a	This is a board game simulator. Some of my friends who never played the board game have tried this and they hate it. I used to play the board game when I was young and I love this. It is good fun and very easy to organize online leagues with friends.  
9988	1	a	I wish I didn't suck at this game so much. Also exploding your own guys with bombs and KOing treemen with flying goblins is hilarious
9990	1	a	I love this turn based fantasy football game. The comments during the game are awesome. The only thing is I cant find player skill board anywhere?! This would help to choose a team at the beginning. Excellent game for those who like tabletop kind of game.
9992	1	a	Gotta love Blood Bowl. Tough game at first but once you get going it's a cracker.
9994	1	a	most frustrating piece of ♥♥♥♥ ever. 5/5 love it.
9996	1	a	Probably the greatest sport in history. A wealth of teams and tactics. Online leagues. Lots of single player content. Cups, tournaments, modes.  I am happy to recommend this. Especially as it is currently on sale for £8.  Get a taste before the Bloodbowl 2 comes out.  Check out a match Skaven vs Orcs:  1st half:   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzQ8AVkr6VM   2nd half:   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnbuEn1CUZI  
9998	1	a	What i dont get is theres a 'new' Madden or FIFA each year but if you like some clobbering on top of your managing this is pretty much the only option except for some crappy Speedball remake.  And its a good option, however this is no normal sports game in a sense but a boardgame and so....   a) The success or failure of every action a player performs is determined by a dice roll which probably (maybe possibly) isnt weighted against you but sure as hell feels like it is. b) Starting out you lack all the hard counters which could soften the impact of yet another failed roll - the opposition doesnt c) The tutorial isnt that helpful so you lack info on how to soften the impact of yet another failed roll or how to prevent them  In conclusion a+b+c= Your ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥ boiling and the neighbors calling the police to detain the gibbering screeching loon next door because someone failed to pick up a ball three times and then died walking a step too much all the while the opposition who is PROBABLY ♥♥♥♥ING GOD DAMN PRANCY ELVES HURT THEM HURT THEM HURT THEM KILL KILL KILL MURDER MAIM ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ GOD DAMN SHUT UP ♥♥♥♥ YOUR RNG ♥♥♥♥ ALT+F4  Yet it is still fun somehow (must be a roguelike thing), butthe longer you play and actually win stuff the more it turns out the manager part isnt that indepth.  Hiring and firing players (no possibility to mix races, also they pretty much are all the same and theres a set limit on types which can be deployed - no all-bruiser teams for example), purchasing some temporary boosters or other stuff which is in essence a chance at a reroll, thats about it. Players can level up and you can select skills or stat boosts - theres actually somewhat many but level ups are slow and a few skills are absolutely essential for the role a player is supposed to fill so youll prolly always wanna chose those.   Theres a 'Blitz' mode which has some more stuff along the same lines along with buying equipment which is expensive, temporary and on top of that provides benefits only at a random chance around 20% and in classic mode the player would gain the visual upgrade on a level up (without the bonus, not sure). Also you have to chose a sponsor and if you dont fullfill certain criteria they take all your money at the end of a season because thats how this works (?!?). Play classic.  Theres 'live' commentary which inevitably gets old after a while.  Still a very fun game despite or more likely because of the random element..oh heh RNG dicked you over again. Roll 1D6 vs Tantrum or break 1D6 objects in a one square radius.
1424	0	a	Awful playing against computer
1425	0	a	If you really like the original board/miniature game... don't buy this, its just too frustrating. Too many bugs (some of which have been there since the very first release), too many missing things (star players, inducements, even a couple of teams) and generally bad involvement from the company/companies behind it.  If you've wanted to play BB before but not had the chance, and this comes up VERY cheap in a sale, then maybe consider it, just to get a brief introduction to the game... before heading over to FUMBBL to play it better, or buying an actual team of minis and playing it on the tabletop where it works best :-)  Update: also, there will be a(nother) new version of this game coming out next year, supposedly early in the year, so definitely don't waste your money on this in the meantime.
1426	0	a	Crashed 4 times in my first 3 games. This game is unnecessarily difficult. There is a short tutorial but it offers very little in terms of how to win. I started reading forums for help and saw what I feared; an awful lot of people frustrated that the AI cheats. Now I am not claiming it does, but I sure wouldn't be surprised if it was true.
1427	0	a	A god damn RNG fest which I guess is fun if you hate yourself.  Playing on baby difficulty I met a Bloodthirster and a bunch of go-♥♥♥♥-yourself demons in my very first game when all I had were skinny girls in bikinis and feathers, which hardly seemed fair. I then suffered five critical failures in a row trying to pick up the damned ball and when the game finally to pity on me and let me grab it the silly bint dropped it when trying to pass a teammate three spaces away. There's only so much punishment a ♥♥♥♥♥ can take before ragequitting.  Maybe I'll try again in the future if global thermonuclear war breaks out and I want to remind myself that things could still be worse.  Also the netcode is ♥♥♥♥ and you can't just play a quick match with your friends without half an hour of hassle trying to figure out how to create a private league or some dumb ♥♥♥♥ and having to navigate an extremely unhelpful menu system. Bananas.
1428	0	a	I looked up a few things on Bloodbowl, now that I've gotten the game, and people say the dice are perfectly fair, they just seem not to be because we don't pay attention to the victories.  Bull.   On multiple occasions I've had the 'you hit the dirt face-first' roll four times in a row--a 1296-to-one chance. On a normal randomization, this wouldn't happen once until you've played for months; I've only had it a few days.  There are very few things more stressful than putting together a good plan, thinking on my feet as circumstances change, accounting for my team's strengths and weaknesses--and my opponents'--preparing for setbacks, spending money for rerolls just in case... and then watching the opponents plow through my defenses with disgustingly high rolls to undo all my work in a manner that's statistically impossible.   One of those few things is to have that happen, come up with a backup plan, set it in action--and watch the dice roller give it to me dry over and over and over again so that a team that should have steamrolled up the field ends up tripping over its shoelaces.  Screw this game--if you haven't bought it yet; don't.
1429	0	a	no ai of any kind. cheats the dice roles to make it hard. i love the board game and wished this was as good.
1430	0	a	Blood Bowl manages to take everything that was great about the tabletop game and books, and remove it. What Games Workshop has left is arbitrary dice rolling, which has even been dilluted to the point where the player cannot see the dice unless certain circumstances apply, and long waits for opponents.  If one is looking for an initial indicator of game quality, the tutorial is usually an excellent place to start. Blood Bowl takes enough time to get in a little of the flavor of the world in which it is built, but decides to leave out little details like rules beyond the basics one might expect from a primer on American Football for 3 year olds, (Ball goes in the end zone, tackling players good, getting injured bad) while blatantly telling the player that if they want to know more, they should look it up.   One might accept that story mode is in fact the true tutorial, since the first mission is simply to finish a game, regardless of win or loss, as though testing a players patience for the slow, laborious plodding of the computer. While the second mission is to throw 2 goblins, with no instructions on how to do so. It becomes more frustrating once you find out how to do so, since in order to accomplish this seemingly simple task, a player must actually overcome 2 phantom dice rolls in addition to simply having the necessary pieces available.  Ultimately Blood Bowl takes what promised to be an exciting, comedic romp through a well established and lore filled world, and turn it into a distillation of the worst elements of a table top miniatures game with poor camera angles and repetetive dialouge.
1431	0	a	i would luv to give this game a great review.  but rng rolls and says .... no  this game, no matter how well you prepare, how well you manoeuvre, how well you customize or even execute attack and defence plays. this game is out to make sure you are un likely to succeed.  so if you do succeed, eventually you will fail, and fail big. if you do fail and fail big, eventually you will succeed. but ultimaly you are not in control. your a puppet to the game.  this game smiles at your battered and bloody corpse at the 5 yard line.
1432	0	a	I can't recommend this to anyone. As much as I love the game and playing it in real life. This version has many bugs/crashes that have yet to be fixed years after they were discovered.
1433	0	a	i love the idea of this game, im not a sports game kinda guy, but a game where you can murder and maim your opponent on the field, count me in.   problem is..  * the dice is in no way fair, when i only fail on a 1, i get nothing but ones, when the oponent only succeeds on a 6 it gets nothing but sixes. * i hate to see dwarfs jumping in and out of tackle zones like they where god damn acrobats, but my elves who have high agi gets pummeled to the ground if they decide to disengage or pick up the ball. * 8 out of 10 times if i use a re roll i get the exact same result, be that if i have 1 or 3 dices to knock someone out. * take cheerleaders and assistant coaches, and it helps nothing, but the AI gets all the great results. * your players will often be ripped apart, and get no SPP (star player points = xp) but the oponent will harvest points like there is no tomorrow  and mind you... this is on easy difficulty.  I mean, the game is kinda fun, and when you start to get your team up there, its cool, but its just too unfair, which often means youll probably say screw this. ive lost my most valued player, with 6 Spp to a measly goblin with no spp, which means if you dont get lucky on the apothicary roll, that player is gone, if you dont reload the entire match and hope for something better.  play Dwarves, and you will win, they are unbelievably tough and though low agi, they get more lucky on agi rolls than Agi heavy teams  i dont recommend it, spite the fact i often play a match or two, because its way too unfair and too random in favor of the AI
1434	0	a	Dice Rolling simulator. I recommend Yahtzee for being more honest.
1435	0	a	I really liked the concept of this game. But I personally cannot recommend it because of the graphics. Everything takes forever to load, and everything takes forever to actually happen. Like when I made a moved and it became a cutscene it wouldn't work and would lag for more than just 10 seconds. It was even worse when I would let the CPU go. Cause then the game would lag until most of my first move was gone. I would only get like a minute and a half to make a decision and how I wanted everything to work. So yeah, I really wished this game worked for me but it doesn't. Too bad so sad.

1440	0	a	WARNING: This is a recreation of a BOARD GAME. You will NOT be playing FOOTBALL. If you were expecting action like the old NFL Bltiz then keep on moving. This is a turn based football game. I'm sure its an excellent recreation of the board game, but they cleverly hide that fact in the video and descriptions. In fact, the only place you can discover that its a board game is in the 'popular user-defined tags'. I believe this was intentional because who actually wants to play a turn based football boardgame on the PC.  Maybe, just maybe, I could see this being fun on a table top with minitures. But even then, the rules defined to make this game work just dont meet my expectation for a fun, exciting sporting event.  This game is just a big NO from me. If you've played the board game, and enjoyed it, i'm sure this is a fine recreation. If you want a football game to be 1 character performing actions to dice rolls based on static positioning, then you may enjoy this game too. If you think football isn't already a long game, and wish it could be dragged out into the longest possible way, then this game is for you.  For everyone else, think twice before buying this game; seriously!
1441	0	a	Just horrible...
1442	0	a	the Game was awsome untill the mouse curser stoped working. Just made it hard to make a game and play.
1443	0	a	doesnt fit on the screen, its ♥♥♥♥
1444	0	a	If you like jokes that go stale after one match, no variation, repeating the same things constantly, feeling cheated, feeling that the 'random' roles really aren't all that random, having control only over the race and team uniforms clothes, and basically a choice in maps that have absolutely no bearing on gameplay whatsoever; Well then! This is the perfect game for you.... just don't waste your money on this garbage. Strategy has been completely reduced to pure luck. This game really feels like it is based solely on chance. Oh, and gaining levels and the amount of hours to get even decent stats is not worth the grind. I'd rather play FF Tactics....WHERE'S MY REMAKE Square!!!!
1445	0	a	I can't believe bugs like the ones with saved formations have not been fixed. Come on, they were in the original Blood Bowl, the developer has had years and years to fix them.  It's too bad, because such easy to fix bugs are the only thing detracting from a great game. I'd take this over the gimped BB2.
1446	0	a	This game has great concept but terrible UI which leads to an unpleasant start. Career Mode is too hard even on Easy. Blood Bowl 2 has addressed alot of the problems with the randomness feeling of the dice rolls. I couldnt reccommend this to anyone unless they are into really tough boardgame video games. Even then, I would just reccomend the 2nd one.
1447	0	a	Game crashes every time on start up.
1448	0	a	I really wanted to like this game.. but it just doesn't make sense. It feels extremely unbalanced and the gameplay is very slow.  They should call it fumble bowl instead.. This is the only game where 3/4 of the team cannot pickup the damn ball.
1449	0	a	what a game
1450	0	a	My entire Khorne Daemon team eliminated from the field in three turns by Halflings. 10/10, would waste thirty minutes of my life that I won't get back again, preferably on something else, like the board game.
1451	0	a	The AI cheats. Blatantly. The dice rolls when the AI rolls the equivalent of double 6's 5 times in a row and follows it up with deliberate death and permanent injury rolls. In one turn you can reasonably expect to have your entire team injured/KO'd/Dead.  Sad really.
1452	0	a	Blood Bowl is amazing, but this version got too many bugs. Wait for Blood Bowl 2 and don't let their sales lure you into this one.  If you're really desperate to play Blood Bowl ASAP:  http://fumbbl.com/ 
1453	0	a	Do you play Blood Bowl: The Miniatures game and wish that it was cheaper, and moved, and you didn't have to get paint all over your hands? Cool, then you'll probably like this game.  If you don't know how to play Blood Bowl already, however, this game sure has hell isn't going to teach you. It will teach you what to click on to make things happen, sure, but as for what starts mean, and how to tell if a player is good or not? You're on your own chum.
1454	0	a	Can't even start the tutorial because it won't let me click the red arrow. Someone else had the same problem over 1,5 yeasrs ago, still not fixed. I regret the purchase.
1455	0	a	If you're familiar with the tabletop version, avoid this game. The dice rolls are terrible. It is skewed against you on 'Normal' difficulty. On 'Easy' they are skewed in your favor. Dice rolls are not random and if you track the dice statistics, they're are terrible.
1456	0	a	Don't get this game is you only plan on playing against the terrible AI. The multiplayer scene is still alive to an extent. Just get BB2 if you want to play single player.  The AI uses modified dice rolls to cheat. Don't let the fanboys tell you otherwise. They give the AI dice rolls with modified integer values in lieu of making the AI better.
1457	0	a	This might have been a good game had the developers bothered to fix the glaring bugs.
1458	0	a	I thought this would be a good game and I gave it a try I really did. It just was not fun at all and turned out to be a very annoying game. It got many good reviews so maybe I am just not getting it but the game is just full of annoying announcers and events that make it miserable to play.
1459	0	a	The game is a strange combination of frustrations. Despite the conveniently undisplayable evidence that the RNG is not biased (which many of the die-hard fans will insist exists anyway without any proof) the game routinely feels as though it is indeed very biased towards the AI dice rolls - even when you're winning and crushing the opposition! I can tell you that, in my experience, playing solo against the AI is a completely different experience compared to playing multiplayer vs a human opponent in terms of RNG fairness. This is why the developers refuse to show you the AI's dice rolls.  However, this is all balanced out by the fact that the AI is terrible - I mean so shockingly bad at the game that the developers had to give all the starting teams you face bonuses in order to make them even slightly challenging in solo play. Which they still aren't.  I have played it a fair bit largely due to nostalgia and my childhood memories of the table top game I used to love.  If you plan to play it solo then be prepared for what 'seems' like a heavily biased RNG and the subsequent frustrations this causes and learn to live with it like I did. In this mode I don't really recommend the game unless you are a very laid back and patient person.  If you plan to play it multiplayer online then you'll probably have a lot more fun. The downside is that you'll have to deal with other internet users though - which is not my cup of tea.
1460	0	a	This game is an AI cheatfest, for every time you knock them down they will knock down 2-3 of your players. This is nothing like the original, what a waste of money. I tried several different teams with the same results each time, the AI had an incredible number of KO rolls. Fanboys can say the rolls are random all they want, but the same results in multiple games says different.
1461	0	a	This is the worst game I have ever played. The game is so heavily skewed towards the computer it is ridiculous. I would consider smashing your painted mini's with a hammer before I would reccomend this game to someone that is a fan of Warhammer.
1462	0	a	So I'm on the side of people who never played the table top. Does this seem like a good strategy game? Yea, it seems well thought out and deep. But sadly I was looking for a bit more spectacle rather than number crunching. I was taken in more for the them of a tree throwing a halfing carrying a ball into the endzone while being blitzed by a demon and an orc. Sadly without ample imagination that just isn't this games strength. If you know you like the board game, by all means grab this and play on. If you wanted something visceral, move on.
1463	0	a	Dice rolling 'randomness' is terrible.
1464	0	a	Game just crashes on start, 10 bucks wasted  Also uninstallation is a ♥♥♥♥♥, the game spreads so many files across your computer it isn't even funny
1465	0	a	Can be enjoyable, but the RnG makes it unplayable in a competitive sense, at least for me.
1466	0	a	this is a luck game, not strategy, the best strategy will lose to luck every time. if this game was 2 dollars i would want my money back to purchase a 6 sided dice, and a cheap toy. roll the dice, if its 1-3, knock it over. if its 4-6, stand it up, reroll, repeat, etc... time and money much better spent. 
1467	0	a	The dumbest piece of horrible ♥♥♥♥ i have ever played. Tactics my ♥♥♥.  The AI dodges EVERYTHING and scoops through your lines game after game.  ♥♥♥♥ Cyanide studios and ♥♥♥♥ this stupid horrendous excuse of a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ BS luck based game.  This is the worst game i have ever played.  No game is as plain ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ as this horrible piece of cancer.  The dice mechs are a joke. There are NO dice rolls. There is only advantage for the AI.  EVERY roll you make will bend you over and ram a huge big wiener up your brown shute.   Blood Bowl is a game by mentally challenged autists FOR mentally challenged autists.. because only they enjoy listening to the horsecrap commentaries of the annoying ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s after getting your brown shute torn open by the cheating hands of the AI.  DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.. it is worse than going to fatcamp.
1468	0	a	Blood Bowl is my absolute favourite table top game. But this version... OMG. It's full of AI errors. First of all, when rolling for Wild Animal, you succeed on 2+ when Blocking or Blitzing, not 4+. Secondly, with AG3 you succeed on 3+ when Dodging into 0 TZ and away from an opponent with no negative modifiers - the same goes for AG4; you succeed on 2+. And the only obvious difference between the 'Medium' and 'Hard' levels is the amount of 1s you roll... And don't even get me started on the introduction of the Khorne roster - while leaving out some of the official rosters (Pact, Slann, Underworld). Thumbs down all the way.
1469	0	a	sucks ♥♥♥ i wish i could get a refund
1470	0	a	This game has a sick sense of humor when it comes to critical rolls. Played two games, and NONE of my catching rolls were good enough to succeed. And that was when my thrower was actually able to pick up the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ball in the first place!

1473	0	a	Not a very good game - dice rolls seriously unbalanced - hard to play to team strengths when they regularly dont work. Seems like the AI is either for or against you - so in then end you are not really playing just watching it unfold. Needs some serious work with BB2 - fully a waste of anyones money till then
1474	0	a	A game designed for tabletop and the odd evening with friends and beer that absolutely doesn't work online in an infinite open league; crippled by people powergaming and setting out to ruin your fun whilst a deliberately imbalanced skill system means that only a few teams can compete... combine that with a rule set that is set up to encourage 'fun chaos' but instead ensures you fail constantly even with perfectly calculated dice odds, and that failure can mean your team ends up outright killed, and the game just isn't worth playing.  I tried to love it, I really did; I have fond memories of a few games of the tabletop with my brother long, long ago. But online every single game devolves into the same cycle of Chaos, Dwarves, Chaos, Chaos, or some other brute team which can simply cripple your players and eke out a win... or a few people abusing the Matchmaking by having 5 or so L6 players hidden amongst some throwaway L1s, and then use the overpowered skills stacked on the individuals to humiliate you.  Those masses of positive reviews? They're from people who really don't care about the community, but will do what ever they want online and damn what it feels like to you to try and play for fun; they're the people still here years down the line that didn't care the game never took off, because they're in it for the shallow ego boost that comes from using an easy team to win match after match. Seriously, the game designed teams as Easy and Hard difficulty and then suffocates under finding literal easy mode teams in match after match after match...  I'm told Blood Bowl 2 rebalanced the teams to make them a bit more equal? But after paying nearly £100 to make this one complete, I'm loathe to let the developers nickle and dime me to an equal level for a game they're already witholding teams for DLC from ...  And they never fixed the bugs in this either! Clicking on any player during kick off breaks your ability to swap substitutes out. Players can simply sit on the Intercept roll if you throw the ball and they have a chance to catch it, and force your entire timer to run down. And it's hard to escape the suspicion that people have individual RNG seeds, with some being much worse than others, when you run into bad luck game after game... someone even went as far as telling me my dice were cursed the other day. It's possibly not true, but in a game SO luck dependent, if you're the sort of person who isn't going to abuse the rules for quick overpower, and finds it frustrating to see your strategy fail because someone else did, or the dice went against you, this game will be absolute torture to you.  I've installed it twice now, and it kills me every time because of that. I end up seething at people being gits because the rules allow it, and you can't stop them, and I can't even have fun with my own team. If this sounds like you too, for goodness sake don't go near this game, not even with the lovely Warhammer Lore.
1475	0	a	Avoid this game at all costs.   While this game hits all the right buttons and promises to be as close to the Table Top game as possible thats as far as it goes. The games are flat and often one sided with a victor decided before the kick off has taken place. So much so that the dice can be so one sided that its stupid. The dice strings are so broken you can see 6 ones in a row and thats just how the games been coded. Not to mention the guys who DDOS attack you while your playing a game so you get booted giving them the auto win. While I love blood bowl I would avoid this company like the plague.

1478	0	a	THIS GAME IS HORRIBLE
1479	0	a	I'm aware this is a RNG game, and that is one of the things that draws me to these sorts of game, and tabletop wargaming in particular. But this nonsense is suspicious.  Every time I get close to winning a match, on easy mind you, things start to go spastic. For example, 0-0 and in the second half, RNG going my way then the AI's, then back again, etc. With the ball two squares from the line, all of a sudden things take a turn for the worse! An enemy zombie is able to go through three red spots, THREE! and picks up the ball. My counter attack with a troll next turn resulted in nothing but red skulls, and for the next three turns in a row, my various counterattacks against said zombie, all resulted in red skulls. Every. Single. One. Even my re-roll. Once the zombie passed the ball to something else and scored, miraculously RNG went normal again, but by then it was too late.  Another good example was that one other time I almost won a match on easy. I made the decision to make a roll for an extra square, given that extra square would put me in the try zone. but failed and fell over. Fair enough, that's RNG. For the next three turns however, my high-agility skaven with extra hands and 2+ chance to pick up, fumbled the ball. In those three turns, two human players were well within reach to blitz me, or even move up to block my movement. But they just stood there watching my skaven suddenly become as nifty as a drunken troll's fart.  All-in-all, this game would be amazing if it wasn't so blatantly bull even on easy. I'm glad I'm only playing this trash to fill in time until Total War: Warhammer releases. F**k this game.  /Whine over. Now to go eat some cheese.
1480	0	a	Steep learning curve. No on the fly multiplayer. Only dedicated Blood Bowl fans should pick this up on Steam.  Random Person: 4/10 Blood Bowl enthusiast: 7/10
1481	0	a	i love warhammer. i love bloodbowl. this game is very pretty and the teams are funny to watch and play with.   the rest is awful.
1482	0	a	DO NOT BUY TOTAL WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY
1483	0	a	THIS GAME IS BY FAR THE WORST GAME IVE EVER PLAYED IT NEVER GIVES U CHANCE TO DO ANYTHING DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS CRAP
1484	0	a	This game is ♥♥♥♥ poor at telling you the rules and just assumes you know them already or directs you to off game sites, forcing a player to read the rules elsewhere is just poor game design.
1485	0	a	This would be a good game and i would give it a positive recommendation, IF: 1) It didnt consistently crash all the time, especialy when you are just about to win a game. 2) The Cpu didnt succeed at 90% plus of its rolls and attempts. 3) You were actually allowed to field 11 players. 4) The Cpu teams didnt get ridiculous player stats and skills compared to what you can have.  I dont understand how there can be so many bugs with a game that is as old as this one? Surely they can release a patch to fix all these errors in it?  Listen if you dont mind playing out an entire game against a OverPowered computer opponent, and just be in front on the last turn only to have the whole game crash, AGAIN, and lose all your progress on that game then go ahead buy this game. If you prefer to play a polished, working game, go with something else.
1486	0	a	After my time with the game I cannot recommend this to anyone. It is a test of sanity and a practice is frustration if you do choose to play the game. You wish it would give you fun, but if you try to have fun and even become good at the game you will find nothing but sorrow and it can even drive you to a deep depression
1487	0	a	biggest pile of bulshit ive ever had the displeasure of playing.... its a broken game with more bugs than any other game ive played, and i have played pretty ♥♥♥♥ buggy games in the past, but this one takes the biscuit!  wizard is broken, camera angles are broken, click function is broken and unselects thing, your literaly wrestlig with these ♥♥♥♥♥♥ functions all the time instead of actually playing the game.  this ♥♥♥♥ should be taken off steam, and ♥♥♥♥ you if you think you think you deserve to make another game of this! fix this ♥♥♥♥ right now before you make another one, this is a complete disgrace!
1488	0	a	This game is impossible..  it is so so stacked against the player..  2 hours can't even say i completed a pass, most turns end for me after a single movement (and I mean one player).  I can't recommend this to anyone really as it doesn't seem to be much of a game and rather more of an agravation.  still better than the new version though..
1489	0	a	Played 30mins of this game, got my ♥♥♥♥ fermly handed to me in my first game playing as undead. Not bad but it needs practice to play properly, would only suggest people who like american football or rugby to play this as this is just that except you can (forced to) cheat by just wiping out the opposing team.  Space Hulk is like a disney game compared to this. Preparing to grind 50+ hours into this just so I can start to enjoy it.
1490	0	a	It's a neat concept, but ultimately wasn't for me. The game looks fun, and easy at first glance; but it actually requires a lot of strategy, and planning. Not ideal for a quick pickup, and go. I can see this one having a dedicated following, but it's not for everyone.
1491	0	a	When it doesn't clog the UI, its die rolls are by no means random. Not even close And when it isn't doing either of those, it just straight up crashes I'm not saying Steam should do refunds. But if they did, I would get this refunded
1492	0	a	This game is complete crap and should be avoided at all cost. in 16 matchs i have yet to every be able to move a full team and spend most of the time only making 1 action just to roll 6 dice and end my turn with a dead player against all types of teams. Spend your money on something better.
1493	0	a	Question; do you like being violated forcibly by Lady Luck, over and over again? If you answered yes to that question, you'd love this game!
1494	0	a	its ok, bugs aplenty
1495	0	a	Load of toss. The combat animations are repetitive and lame and the AI is so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that when you get tired of scratching your head, you can go and make a coffee half way through a game without the need to pause, as the score is unlikely to change during your absense. When the game is working as it should be (which is quite rare) its about as much fun and wiping your ♥♥♥♥ with stinging nettles. 1 / 10.
1496	0	a	Welcome to Turnover Bowl The land of literal 'Turn Over'

1498	0	a	You get beaten senseless even on easy by the AI because they make these unbreakable cages. No point playing until that ♥♥♥♥ is fixed.
1499	0	a	Such a gutless game ... it could have been way more enjoyable if it wasn't for the gutless factor. It has rather arcane and complicated rules that would take a lifetime to learn. Can't recommend this to anyone, though I'll probably be hard headed and stupidly keep playing it.

1501	0	a	Do you like gambling? Do you like American football? Do you like fantasy creatures? Well, Blood Bowl combines all three of these things (dice from gambling, a ruleset based on American football, and teams of creatures from the fantasy Warhammer universe) and turns it into a board game. Blood Bowl Chaos Edition is the most complete digital version of the Blood Bowl board game to date.  Almost all of the dice rolling is hidden from the player (unless the player chooses to see it), leaving the player with only the fun choices: what team to play, and then who will be on that team and how they will play. The only dice you'll have to 'touch' (ie, interact with), are the block dice, which randomly offer you a set number of possible outcomes of unit vs unit interactions based on the strength values of your units (you should really look up the mechanics of Blood Bowl if you want specifics; they're too in depth for me to go into here). However, dice rolling is central to Blood Bowl, so even if you try to ignore it, it will always be there. And, between random events like where the fans come on to the field and knock out half your players and the inevitable moment when one of your players dies, there will be nothing you can do about it. No matter how great your tactical planning or how immense your foe appears, a single dice roll can turn the tide and usually does...in theory. There are 'bad' teams, meaning you will have a lot of problems if you chose them, and will likely lose. Even if you find a decent team that you want to play, you may have to work harder than you'd expect to play they how they're 'supposed' to be played. There's a 'cheating' system that will give you money if you go up agianst higher ranked teams, but there will often be times when the cheats you can afford are simply not good enough. If one of your players gets injured and is forced to miss the next game, you'll be stuck with a mercinary that is always worse than the player it replaces thatnks to a trait called 'Loner.' If one of your players dies, it's gone forever. All of this culminates in a game that feels extremely punishing when you lose and is easy to become addicted to. You may have fun with it, but in my hours of play I rarely did. The dice rolling sucked away over 20 hours of my life, and it wasn't worth it. Avoid unless you love chance-based games.
1502	0	a	Don't take me wrong for the NO recommendation. The game itself is amazing. But it lacks what lots of strategy games lack of: A good AI. The AI is way too easy to defeat, so it has only interest if you pretend to play in Multiplayer.
1503	0	a	BLOODBOWL vs. CHAOS LEAGUE  I have mixed feelings about this game after buying it cheap in a Steam sale. However I can't really recommend it based on it's history.  Let me explain. Originally Cyanide produced a game called Chaos League (with an expansion called Sudden Death) which was a direct take off of Bloodbowl the board game. After a big legal dispute with games workshop they ended up developing Bloodbowl the computer game.   The trouble is that I don't think this is an improvement on Chaos League. It's biggest advantage is that you can play it online. However otherwise it's not an improvement and in some regards is worse. Personally I think Chaos League is more fun.  Where it falls down in comparison to Chaos League is the dice rolls. Unlike the boardgame version the dice rolls that the AI makes are suspiciously unrandom. e.g. There should be a 1-6 chance of a fumbled throw but my experience of this was far more frequent (6 times in a row once), the AI rarely fails it's dodge rolls etc and simply put the die rolls often don't seem random, certainly I've never seen dice come up with the same results so often in real life.  To my mind another advantage of chaos league is you have the option to play a real time option which you can pause (Which personally I prefer) which allows you to plan your moves and is useful if you want to stop mid-game for any reason. Games also last longer and don't have half time, so no irritating half time whistle just when you were about to score.   Chaos League also has the option to buy and develop star players for each race, which are a lot of fun. But you don't get them in Bloodbowl, I also prefer some elements of the layout in Chaos league and some of the little touches such as when a player is killed a little tombstone appears on the pitch and the players spirit is seen departing into the ether. There are a few minor tweaks and improvements in Bloodbowlbut not enough to make it a better game.  Overall if you want to play against friends I'd say buy the board game. If you want to play against the computer I'd buy Chaos league (Sudden death edition) it's simply more fun and you won't find yourself swearing at the compurter as much. If you want a strategy game buy football manager. I'd only buy this if you intend to play online.
1504	0	a	I got this game because i was a HUGE fan of the tabletop game back in the day. blood bowl, in my opinion is such a great concept. sadly the game falls short of capturing the magic of the tabletop game. very tedious and just overall not fun.
1505	0	a	Don't bother buying it. Bugged all to hell, hasn't been patched. Game crashes almost every other match.
1506	0	a	It's overly complicated and not fun.  It's gradually becoming clearer and clearer to me that there haven't been any enjoyable Warhammer games made since 1998
1507	0	a	It ♥♥♥♥ign sucks! When the ♥♥♥♥ are they going to fix all the bugs?
1508	0	a	Criminally disappointing quality for this game. Game play is great. AI is quite reasonable and fun on hard mode. Bugginess of the game is dreadful.  Sadly the game crashes and glitches quite regularly. One of the most annoying things about the game is when you have less than 11 players on the pitch, it won't let you actually bring on more players. Once again this is sadly not an issue limited to this version of the game, but I had sincerely hoped that it would have been rectified in this one.  If you’re an absolute fan and you’ll play through no matter what, then it’s worth it at the discounted rate. Don’t pay full price for this game or you will be disappointed with the quality.  Screams of a blatant money grab. Could not have passed through any QA controls and been released like this.  I love the game, I just hate to see something so good ruined by such poor coding and quality control 
1509	0	a	So far, a resounding NO.  This is one of those games that doesn't program good strategy for difficulty, but instead screws you on the RNG. I don't recall ever using bad tactics and getting away with it, but I can't count the number of times that I've not gotten away with good tactics either, as the computer somersaults through tacklers numbering three or four on his way out of a fine pickle.  Games that rely too heavily on the 'randomness' (if we're even going to call it that) are simply too frustrating to make it worth the effort. The game also does a ♥♥♥♥ poor job giving you the tools to manage match-ups so understanding the chances of success is a vicious learning curve, most of that curve being your back, bent over, taking the CPUs how-do-you-do up your ♥♥♥.
1510	0	a	I have seen enough people in status 'Playing Blood Bowl' that I thought it might be good. The reviews are also 'Very Positive'. I decided to pick it up on sale. What a mistake. I got absolutely no enjoyment out of the game. Even going through the tutorial was boring and annoying as could be. After playing a few games... no thanks. I will not be returning to play this one. There isn't a tremendous amount of strategy, the RNG is terrible, the graphics poor, and the gameplay repetetive and boring.
1511	0	a	Nah ♥♥♥♥ this game b. Don't buy this nonsense. It makes me mad. I thought it would be like a new mutant league football game. It's not. ♥♥♥♥ this game yo.
1512	0	a	I wouldnt buy this or play it again if my life counted on it. It's fun I guess and shows growth and a definite possible franchise, but there is just something wrong and disturbing with it. The game is so poorly mapped out and made. You can never get home games, AI cheats way to much, it has horrid difficulty spikes, controls are awkward, it's a little over-complicated and it's overall a really bad/sub-par game.
1513	0	a	So far..the stupidest ♥♥♥♥ing game I've ever played. Everything comes down to computer based 'rolls' which they will screw you over in every chance they get. I thought this was going to be a real-time football game. NOPE. It is turned based, which honestly screws the WHOLE concept up (how in God's name can you have a TURNED BASED football game?!). I thought this was going to be a 'Blitz' style game which would have been fun. This is the farthest thing from it. Waste of money in my opinion.
1514	0	a	I really wanted to like this game. I have enjoyed it at times but there is a lot of dice rolling luck involved. I am about to score only one defender, a halfling midget! The halfling kills my Thrower as I run past. Then my runner fails TWICE to pick up the ball with NO defenders around. Eventually the halfling picks up the ball on the first try. FUUUUuuuuuddddgee. I was on easy mode for Pete's sake!!!  The other thing that I dislike, is that there is no clear way to build up your team. Your players level up but it doesn't seem to do much good. You can buy better armor but that seems to be worthless. Again, it seems to be way more luck that strategy.
1515	0	a	I really wanted to like this game but....  I just went and played a different game instead. Overall 5/10
1516	0	a	THIS GAME IS VERY HARD! Sorry for the all caps, but that's what you need to know going into this. Unless you're the kind of person who can handle losing to the AI more often than not (even on Easy difficulty) don't bother with Blood Bowl. This game requires equal degrees of strategic brilliance and utter masochism to be enjoyed. Fans of the game insist the AI doesn't fudge dice rolls in its favor but I'm not so sure on that considering that the AI players almost always make successful dodge rolls regardless of Agility. But, even if it doesn't cheat, this is hardly a relaxing game experience and seems to be aimed at people who enjoy ungodly difficulty.  I really gave this game the best chance that I could, playing hotseat matched against myself until I was certain I understood the rules before moving on to play the AI. Ultimately I clocked in about 22 hours of play over the course of five days before deciding to request a refund. That's the other thing, even if the difficulty and very steep learning curve aren't a problem for you this game simply isn't worth the $30 price tag. I wish I could've enjoyed this game, it's very charming and you can tell the people who made it were fans of the original board game but (call me crazy) I think life is frustrating enough without something that's supposed to be for entertainment frustrating you further. This was the only time I've ever requested a refund from Steam based on a game's difficulty (every previous time was because the game had problems running) and this is the first Steam review I'm writing. That should give you an idea of how much Blood Bowl drove me up a wall.
1517	0	a	This game is garbage. This is by far the worst purchase I have ever made on steam. I regret buying this game and I wish I could get my .7 hours back.
1518	0	a	This game is a buggy mess that doesn't even let you place all of your players on the feild at the start match, constantly crashes, and sometimes the AI opponent will just sit there and let it's turn clock run out instead of playing the game. And since they already release the second one (which is also complete ♥♥♥♥) you can go ahead and forget ever getting any hotfixes for this buggy piece of crap.
1519	0	a	1. IT'S AMERICAN FOOTBALL.  I DON'T LIKE AMERICAN FOOTBALL. THAT'S WHY I HATE IT DESPITE NOT KNOWING HOW THE GAME WORKS.  2. YOU CAN LOSE PLAYERS TO INJURY AND DEATH. I CAN'T TAKE THAT KIND OF ♥♥♥♥. I CAN PLAY MAGIC THE GATHERING JUST FINE BUT TAKE ISSUE WHEN PPL CAN TAKE MY CARD AFTER KILLING MY MONSTER AND TEAR IT INTO HALF.   I DON'T RECOMMEND THIS GAME BECAUSE I'M TOO GOOD FOR THIS KIND OF NONSENSE. 
1520	0	a	Pile of orc dung. 
1521	0	a	♥♥♥♥♥♥ and boring, chess with football rules, the only difference is it has blood. 0/10
1522	0	a	So I thought it was going to be fantasy Madden with really violent tackles and special abilities. It's a strategy board game.
1523	0	a	Buggy, lacks a functioning tutorial, so if you don't know how to play the game from elsewhere, forget it, (included tutorial is a guaranteed CTD). An example of why Steam needs to grant the abiltity to return games.
1524	0	a	The people that made this game have some kind of grudge against humanity and want to make everyone as miserable as they are.  There is no way that this is using the RNG on the computer, the dice break for the AI almost everytime, without re-rolls even. It reminds me of the auto-balancer in the old NBA Jam game.
1525	0	a	If you've never played these kinds of games get ready for hell!!! The rolling system is waaaayyyy too unbalanced. Nothing like getting to the 1 yard line just to have your nimble elf trip up and die after falling on the spiked ball. Super frustrating to play but what the heel if you have time to kill.
1526	0	a	I would not recommend this game due to the lack of casual gameplay on the easy setting and rigged AI dice rolls and turns. Alot of other fanboys will just say that I am bad or don't understand the game, however, I do get that the game is extreamly in depth and like that aspect, it is why I purchased it in the first place. With that fanboy garb set aside, really looking at the game there are tons of issues for new players and people who just want to have fun, not have to rage about cheap and unfair AI. The AI's dice rolls being rigged are the most frustrating part of the game bar none. If not for these rigged single player settings the game could be real fun. I have no problem with RNG in games in fact I love that aspect, however, this is not the case here. Yet again alot of fanboys and other will continuiously state that it is not rigged, that people just dont understand the brutality of RNG and statistics. but, I do thats the problem, and thats why I know that the game is rigged. In conclusion I would rate this game a 2 out of 10, some people may like the way the game AI cheats, but I think most casual gamers playing on easy just want to enjoy their experience when playing. If I wanted unfair and imbalanced AI I would play on hard setting, Overall, I got this game on sale for 75% off so you would think I cant really complain... but I just got my refund. So if your going to spend any money at all on this title I would suggest doing some research first. You will find I'm not alone in my review. Ok fanboys, let me have it now, you know you all can't contain your bias.   Overall rating 2 out of 10 main issue being rigged gameplay on single play mode  no casual settings just easy=hard normal=real hard and hard=brutal   ALSO BEWARE FANBOY BIAS, (they can't help themselves)
1527	0	a	i love it hate it cant manage to do a touchdown ai is a cheating ♥♥♥♥
1528	0	a	 AMURIKA-BALL!!!  I hate 'foot-ball', I don't know the rules or how to play the game itself, and this game just adds onto that confusion, no thanks.  0/10

1530	0	a	What ever you do for the love of Pete don't by this stinky pile of buggy crap.
1531	0	a	mouse doesn't work and no matter what I hook it up to I get 1/4 of the screen hacked off. otherwise looked fun.
1532	0	a	one of the only reviews I have ever done :/. Blood bowl is an interesting game, at first i looked at it and thought it would be fun, however it was not. The main reason for this is due to a few reasons 1. 100% luck, if your not lucky you can not even pick up the ball 2. the races, most of the 'races' are very similar and some only feature 1 - 2 'different units' 3. Not newbie friendly, their is no real easy way to start a game with a small and weak team
1533	0	a	Was really fun before blood bowl 2 came out but now there's almost no one playing it although its still a great game
1534	0	a	Don't bother buying this game unless you enjoy losing a lot. It doesn't matter what race you play, the strategy you use, or the team you build, you're going to lose. I've only scored once and I've never won a game. After a while, it just stops being fun. I wish I could just get my money back.
1535	0	a	Horrible waste of money guys, the cpu is rather clearly stacked to the point where at least once every two or three games I have to just restart. Today I tried twice to play and just a total let down.
1536	0	a	+ I waited more than 20 years for a Blood Bowl video game that did not suck...  - I'm still waiting. As a kid, I painted three entire teams of miniatures for the board game. I've played this for 97 minutes; I bought it the week it came out. If that doesn't tell you all you need to know then I can't help you.
1537	0	a	Positive: 2 ways of playing - real time or turn-based Good picture  Negative: Boring gameplay No balance within team Doesn't matter which race you choose - same gameplay Unstable
1538	0	a	Never playing again...
1539	0	a	Never playing again...
1540	0	a	I liked Blood Bowl the real game as a kid, a few years ago myself and my friends picked this up and played a league and i sucked at it i sucked so bad i never won a match i got so frustrated that i vowed never to play it again and i havent done since i can't reccomend it just because i hate how much i suck at it haha but really you should decide for yourself on this one but personally i found it a lot harder than the real thing.
1541	0	a	Good idea, abysmal realisation
1542	0	a	'Easy' mode is not easy. Even on classic. Dice rolls are ridiculously broken. AI is insanely difficult. Campaign mode is a joke. Absolutely no leeway for noobs. I didn't score a single point in my first 3 hours which is disheartening. Thought this would be a blood bath, and I was right. Got killed, maimed and knocked out on the regular. Congrats AI, you suck.
1543	0	a	This game sucks!
1544	0	a	  This game is unplayable trash. Its like normal football... exept all luck. its not a 'strategy' game. It's roll the dice, highest number wins. The players will fail at PICKING THE BALL UP! LIKE, WHY? It's trash. that's why. also throws have about a %50 of being complete. and if you miss you can pick the ball back up. Right? No. Wrong. if you drop the ball its a turn over. AND AI NEVER DROPS THE BALL. Is that how the devolopers thought football was like? yea well if they did they are right. Drop the ball? Turn over. Miss a pass? Turnover. I get it's fiction. But still. this is unplayable. I don't care if MICKEY MOUSE JUMPS ON THE FIELD (That doesn't happen). I JUST WANT IT TO BE PLAYABLE!!! I Don't know if the 2nd one's any better... Because I'm not buying it. DO NOT and I repeat DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!! anyone remember Rugby 15? well this is like that... if you couldn't pick up the ball... Thats how bad it is... don't buy it... It's Trash...
1545	0	a	Was really disappointed with this one.Looked great,orcs and lizardmen! what could go wrong?  To sum it up the playability of this game is tedious,slow,and annoying.Did i mention slow?  The way turnovers work in this game sucks and i mean sucks! Do not buy this.I really wish i could get my money back.  Let me explain...it has nothing to do with fumbles or interceptions mind you.Everytime your player comes near   the other team,there is a roll.Now I understand randomness,,,but this style of play is horrible.There is no flow.  Cool art and universe aside,this game could have been so much more.Its atrocious gameplay style wrecks   what could be an amazing concept.Something I've thought about since D&amp;D and Madden days of old.(think 90's)  Seroiusly wished i looked at a gameplay video before pulling the trigger on this one,I would definetly reccomend  doing so before purchasing.I never played any other Blood bowl and i think i never will if its similar with  the style of play. Hope this saves you
1546	0	a	The multiplayer in this game is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, so you have to play with yourself.
1547	0	a	dead game, do not buy, Just get the BB2 if you are into it
1548	0	a	dis game almost as gay as socer
1549	0	a	  Too hard to learn. I tried but really the curve is almost impossible. Really not for me
1550	0	a	The Worst Game I Have Ever Played And I've played a lot of games. DO NOT BUY THIS
1551	0	a	RNG ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, incredebly frustrating when things go bad and compleatly unreawarding when they go well. I hope the devs get their ♥♥♥♥ kicked in. ♥♥♥♥ this game and ♥♥♥♥ the losers who like it. shame really could be a good game if it were an actual game and not a puzzle game based around AVODING dice rolls. IF YOU LIKE THIS GAME THEN YOU ARE A LOSER.
1552	0	a	you can play this game for free here  https://fumbbl.com  &lt;-- add me as a friend if you want to get a league going
1553	0	a	Game crashes every time i play match, and i cant just even save game during match,cause there is no such option in menu, only abondon the game.I dont think my PC bad i think that game developers make it with big amount of bugs,such as heroes standing on 1 place and not doing anything in real time mode
1554	0	a	I cant decide on weather its worth keeping this game or what comes out of my dogs ♥♥♥♥♥♥. Seriously it is a close call as this games AI dice roller stinks worse than my dog waste products. I have got players with the relevant skills failing 90% of their rolls and going up againts players who have no skills but can go through 3 player areas and not fail a roll and im not just talking a one off freak I am talking every dam turn. On deep contenplation my dogs ♥♥♥♥ is a better thing to keep than this game.
1555	0	a	Auuugghh... I REALLY want to post a positive review of this game. I do. I've been a Blood Bowl fan for years. It's the fantasy-sports-comedy game of your dreams.   So what's the problem? Playing with friends online is such an enormous PITA and so unnecessarily complicated that half of my recorded playtime has actually been spent in the menus trying to get the @#$% to work. I also really don't appreciate that once my team gets put in a league, it's basically in a tomb -- you can never again use the team outside that league. League manager lost interest in the game? Can't add a friend to the league due to aforementioned complicated PITA? TDB. Start all over with creating a new team.   Once you're actually IN a game and PLAYING, it's a great game -- hilarious and lots of fun. But good luck ever getting there. Really hope this gets fixed for BB2.
1556	0	a	I bought this game on sale, I thought it looked like it would be quite fun. Strategy american football, with warhammer mixed in just sounds like it should be.   I started the game up and there is way too much stuff to learn and understand to even begin playing. It's not even like you can jump in and work it out yourself through trial and error, I wouldn't mind doing that. It may be because as I've gotten older I've lost alot of patience with games but i normally give them a chance. This one I just couldn't.    10 minutes in and I just closed it and deleted.  Don't be discouraged if you are really into your strategy games i'm sure it's good given a bit of time but for me it's a no  BLOODBOWL - 0 / 10
1557	0	a	I think there might be a perfectly good game in here. As a matter of fact, I'm positive that there is.   The problem here is that I have no idea how the hell I'm supposed to play properly and the game has no intention of teaching me, either. When a game developer has enough contempt for their audience to use the tutorial for a relatively complex game to teach the bare minimum and tell the player to read the (sizeable) rule book if they want to understand anything beyond this, they're obviously in the wrong business.  If you're already a fan of the tabletop Blood Bowl, this game is a faithful recreation (so far as I can tell) and you'll probably love it. For anyone else, unless you're willing to invest several hours into studying how the game works and a lot of trial and error, steer clear.
1558	0	a	amazing the IA isnt real. they can dodge 7 tacle in one round ( they did this 1game on 2) and i never did better than 2 dodge. I m amazone so i have the dodging ability. So yes the game is good but only in board game the video game is not funny so no i will not buy the new blood bowl and i unistall this one cause i cant play solo
1559	0	a	This is probably one of the most frustrating games I've played. If you are used to playing Wargame stuff with dice rolls then it will probably be less frustrating for you as you'll probably be used to it.   The game is generally very confusing, especially the panel layout and the way the teams function.  The campaign wa aweful, I restarted 5 times just to find a team I could understand. Even on easy dificulty, the games randomness makes it difficult.   I really need to stop buying turn based Games Workshop games, always dissapointed
1560	0	a	Auuugghh... I REALLY want to post a positive review of this game. I do. I've been a Blood Bowl fan for years. It's the fantasy-sports-comedy game of your dreams.   So what's the problem? Playing with friends online is such an enormous PITA and so unnecessarily complicated that half of my recorded playtime has actually been spent in the menus trying to get the @#$% to work. I also really don't appreciate that once my team gets put in a league, it's basically in a tomb -- you can never again use the team outside that league. League manager lost interest in the game? Can't add a friend to the league due to aforementioned complicated PITA? TDB. Start all over with creating a new team.   Once you're actually IN a game and PLAYING, it's a great game -- hilarious and lots of fun. But good luck ever getting there. Really hope this gets fixed for BB2.
1561	0	a	I bought this game on sale, I thought it looked like it would be quite fun. Strategy american football, with warhammer mixed in just sounds like it should be.   I started the game up and there is way too much stuff to learn and understand to even begin playing. It's not even like you can jump in and work it out yourself through trial and error, I wouldn't mind doing that. It may be because as I've gotten older I've lost alot of patience with games but i normally give them a chance. This one I just couldn't.    10 minutes in and I just closed it and deleted.  Don't be discouraged if you are really into your strategy games i'm sure it's good given a bit of time but for me it's a no  BLOODBOWL - 0 / 10
1562	0	a	I think there might be a perfectly good game in here. As a matter of fact, I'm positive that there is.

1563	0	a	This game could have been amazing. Except for one big problem. The bugs killed it.   I convinced 8 people to buy it and play a league. But the bugs prevented us from finishing it.

1565	0	a	I cant decide on weather its worth keeping this game or what comes out of my dogs ♥♥♥♥♥♥. Seriously it is a close call as this games AI dice roller stinks worse than my dog waste products. I have got players with the relevant skills failing 90% of their rolls and going up againts players who have no skills but can go through 3 player areas and not fail a roll and im not just talking a one off freak I am talking every dam turn. On deep contenplation my dogs ♥♥♥♥ is a better thing to keep than this game.

1568	0	a	I love blood bowl. Real time. But this is the most unstable game ever. When you are winning 19 to 0, and it crashes with 26 seconds left, it pisses ya off. Multiple times game just crashes in the middle of a match. and only when I'm winning. Drives me nuts. Legendary was always stable.   NO mods, stock, and it crashes.
1569	0	a	blood bowl legends,or the first one was a good start point(my introduction to bb).when chaos edition came out was disapointed had several problems in fact never got it to play on home comp,only laptop.but bb2 is out and getting better. so just skip chaos and legends and go for bb2
1570	0	a	Caution, this game is total garbage if you intend to play single player!   For two reasons:  1) Every halftime there's just enough time to score only one goal! If your unit fails to pick up the ball you won't have enough time to score. Same goes to the AI! There are, of course, other factors, too, which influence scoring but for the sake of keeping this review short I merely wanna point out that one halftime simply isn't long enough to allow either mistakes or bad dice rolls by the player or AI. Sure, sometimes you're lucky and score two times but that's quite rare. Only long passes might help you to score more often if you're lucky...   2) The code makes no difference between long and short term effects. When you completely dominate the enemy team even their weakest player will suddenly start to kill your best player as some sort of weird vengeance mechanic, I guess? Even using a medic doesn't seem to help there what makes blood bowl look like a litte desperate.. Since that's not the only situation where BS happens I must come to the conclusion that there's definitively some shenanigans going on behind the curtain instead of random RNG..  I suppose the game is more fun online.. I usually played on medium difficulty with standard settings.. 4/10 for stupid random BS and only 8 turns per halftime.. It's simply no fun to know that you won't be able to score, not to mention other oddities which take the fun out of the game for no real reason but causing anger and frustration.. Don't destroy the AI or some random midget will kill your best player, experience that three times to cry foul at that game..
1571	0	a	Avoiding the game would be a better option unless your a die hard fan of the series. A reskin of the 2013 version on the same engine.
1572	0	a	buy 2013 instead, it had more features and had KERS to make it more interesting. also my force feedback has been wonky so far with 2014 which is a problem that I didnt have with 13 for sume reason.
1573	0	a	hmm.. well there isnt much to report. It is exactly the same as 2013.. Literally nothing different except engine sound, 8 gears, and less traction to similate the new 2014 F1 cars... And a couple of new tracks, per the F1 season.  Other than that it is F1 2013.. Like, same everything, as if the files were not even touched. Just simply cut and pasted. No graphic updates, no new menu styles or colors, no new voices, just nothing..  Got halfway through 1st practice session at season opener Melbourne and turned it off.  a waste, unfortunately
1574	0	a	As you would guess. This game is basically F1 2013.5  However Codemasters are the only company in the world who could copy and paste a game and still make it worse. Sidepod glitches are worse in my opinion while Autospin curbs still exist and the online is more unstable than ever!  For the record. The game is still quite fun and challenging to drive on the wheel, however pads have InBuilt traction control which gives them zero wheelspin and better tyre wear. In wet conditions the gap between the wheel and pad can be as large as 3 seconds, which is simply crazy. This is making league racing almost impossible, which is the only reason i play the game.  Codies have had 5 years to improve, the game however has made no significant improvments, While luke spring, Steve hood continue to ignore all of the community and continue to make broken games!  F1 2015 will be on a new engine (So they say...) So this for me is the game that will make or break codemasters f1 games. The chances of a improved game are slim, but we can only hope!
1575	0	a	I really want to enjoy this game. As someone that has played F1 2011 onward this is somewhat dissapointing, it's far too Arcady for me, F1 2013 was a good challenge, this isn't, even with all driver assists off the car is easy to control. The steering does not feel connected to the car at all, when I'm stood still and I turn my wheel 90 degrees, the wheel in the car does the same, when I'm moving this is not true, there is still assistance on the steering and it really frustrates me. I never know how much I need to turn the wheel to go through a corner, because it changes depending on how the game feels.  It's a big shame, but save your money and get F1 2013, or for a really good experience, iRacing. Hopefully CM will fix this for F1 2015, but I won't be pre-ordering this time.
1576	0	a	To be perfectly honest, dont buy this game if you are patient enough to wait for the next gen version. This game has only gone down hill.   The only reason i will get many hours on this game, is because i consider myself relatively good at the game (So i can race competitively in leagues) but its also F1. Thats the only things that are keeping me interested in playing it.  There are still many bugs and glitches that NEED to be fixed. There are many issues regarding Pad users and Wheel users in which the two are very unbalanced seeing the pad users to have a lot more traction.   Now if you are simply the arcade 'career' mode racer (which i have nothing against) Then fine you may enjoy this game.   However if you are interested in actually getting some sort of immersion and competitiveness out of this game, you wont find it unless there is a patch for this bug, which i doubt will happen.   Its a poor effort F1 2014. To be honest it doesnt even replicate the 2014 season very well either. The engines sound poor, the steering wheels arent replicas to real life, its just a copy paste of 2013, but with different sounds and lower downforce.   Get it on a sale or something.. There is no way this game is worth £30 of your money.
1577	0	a	Like the PC gamer review quote '   With its fundamentals unchanged and last year’s foray into classic cars removed, F1 2014 provides very little beyond a perfunctory car and track update. '  I am not impressed at all.
1578	0	a	As time changed my opinion about this game changed too. Just realised how crap this game really is.  Very few changes from 2013 only BAD CHANGES.  For me the biggest con is the handling despite being a pad user. I hate that I have very bad grip in high speed the car just doesn't wanna f__ turnin, when you are in slow speed corners the entire thing is just so crap, you drift fullthrottle through every single accelaration zone, the car isn't a challange to drive. NO LOCKUPS even, in high large brakes I can barely lockup in the wet with abs off.  In my opinion if u want a good experience u better DON'T get this game. Becuase on this game you DONT NEED TO BE SKILLED TO BE FAST, you just need to full throttle and full brake out of every corner, also didn't even talk about the mariokarting where u go down to lean and just full throttle and upshift.. just disgusting. Leagues have been ruined thanks to the handling too, people couldnt do wet races also people had to make seperate pad and wheel leagues because of the pad having overpowered traction, which was crazy, there are many videos about it on youtube.   By the way you cannot say that I dislike this game because I suck at it. Because I am in the top 50 in some of the tracks in time trial.  Final thoughts: Don't get this game I do regret getting it. Just get f1 2013 or f1 2010 they are the best. Don't ask me about f12015 but I heard that has issues too so yeah. Thanks for reading.
1579	0	a	This is a game that feels like a low-effort gap filler thrown out to fill the gap between F1 2013 (the last 'good' game of this generation) and F1 2015 (the first game on next-gen).  Even basics are poorly done - such as the Williams being set in the game's data files to a Renault engine rather than a Mercedes.  With mods to rebalance the cars and correct things like cars with the wrong engines, it's a lot better.  But don't bother with it now. Just buy F1 2015 and play the 2014 season mode instead.
1580	0	a	Don't get me wrong, it's still a fine game and if you enjoy Formula 1 you'll still like this game. But with all the additional content 2013 has, and being the same price (May get it even cheaper in a Steam Sale) I'd rather recommened that version. Besides some rule changes and the Russian Grand Prix, there's nothing new to be found in this version plus no classic modes found in 2013
1581	0	a	If you like F1 2013 and want a reskin then look no further. It's right here for £30.
1582	0	a	This game is sadly just F1 2013 with modded cars... I'm filing for a refund. This is really bad guys.
1583	0	a	Rubberrishhhhh  You don't even have to look for ABS or TC.  This game's physics is crap.
1584	0	a	Its F1 2013 with some new paint on the cars, some different sounds on the cars. Does not feel like a new game rather than a 2014 season DLC. Dont buy this unless you skipped atleast the last game if not the last few games. 
1585	0	a	I've had it since release day and currently not sure how I fall on this one.  Essentially F1 2013 updated for the season (same engineer, voice commands etc), Codies have at least incorporated the new rules to a great(ish) extent. You'll now take the tyres you set your fastest lap in Q2 into the race so you can go balls-out (if you make it) in Q3 for pole with a set of the softs.  The sounds in general seem pretty good. The engines of the three maufacturers are represented and could be recognised from the onboard footage I watch week in week out on the BBC, Sky,  F1.com , YouTube etc.  In terms of gameplay it appears fairly accurate. The Mercedes disappear up the road and the WIlliams, Red Bulls, Ferraris and to a lesser extent, the McLarens, scrap over the other podium spout and the top 10 order.  The total lack of control of ERS is a significant negative for this game though. In a year where the charging and discharging of the non-combustion engine has become an even more pivotal role Codemasters decides to bottle it and take that away from the driver.  The 'classic' content from F1 2013 was a huge plus and one I revelled in personally. To not only not improve on but to remove it from the franchise was a bit of a kick in the teeth. The Scenarios and Season Challenges are welcome continues but it feels somewhat lacking. These new generation turbo cars would be complemented by some 1980s turbo kit.  Multiplayer-wise, to date, I've really struggled with this game personally. I've probably spent more time in lobbies than I have racing. Can't think of a game version I've not tried and a lot of games have just ended up being full of kids with keyboards; no interest in a race. Just a destruction derby a lot of the time. I have no time for people who don't leave you room and would rather turn into an accident, lock wheels, than turn away and maintain momentum.  Right now I don't think I'd recommend it as you can be charged a bit of a silly price for it. With it not being next-gen and most of my friends eing on Xbox One or PS4 I've not had to shell out for a console version as well this year.  Do I recommend this game? As it stands, unlesss you're a big F1 fan - and you don't already own it - I'd say no and I wasn't expecting to say that.
1586	0	a	I seem to be saying it year after year; F1 2011 is Codemasters finest Formula One game. It's disappointing to say it once more, but it's fact. This 2014 game is a step forward in on track driving but still lacking in immersion off track.   The game is enjoyable on the whole and the price drop is welcome since there is alot of copy paste going on. The ontrack handling is very enjoyable requiring skill but the cars are more realistic and manageable, the brakes on the other hand seem to have been dumbed down in difficulty. You can really push the brakes now and there is a nice little audible that give you a hint in advance of any lockup. It seems to work well for gameplay. The lack of traction in general has made racing the cars on the limit a hell of a lot of fun and very satisfying in getting those perfect laps, or if you over cook it a little and go into a drift.  The rules changed and removed KERS making overtaking a little trickier, but that in turn made successful overtaking more satifying. The AI is still not very bright; at overtaking and can easily be lead into trying it around the outside, where it has to slot back in behind. Also sometimes it get offline and seem to just give up trying to take the corner and lets numerous cars go by before it slots back into the train.  There's no 3D modelled interactive agent, no paddock or motor homes. No interaction with the media and no press interviews for podiums. All hurting the game series since losing it in 2012. The animations are all old, even the HUD graphics are 99% from F1 2013.   I'd recommend it just on the racing, but without the immersion it falls down to it's older brother, F1 2011. Don't get me wrong it's a step in the right direction, but I wouldn't endorse it as is to friends when F1 2011 exists. F1 2011 might be outdated, but it holds all the longevity gameplay items the newer F1 games by codemasters can only dream about,
1587	0	a	Career mode has received absolutely no significant updates, you cannot pick your driver number, your racing suit has the name and nationality of the driver you are replacing, there are no podium celebrations, and certain tracks have not been updated, notably Monza, the runoff of parabolica is not paved as it was this year.  The fact that F1 classics is missing also takes away from a game that is only a slightly changed version of F1 2013. Don't waste your money on this game.
1588	0	a	Whilst I'm actually very much enjoying this game I have to say it's a bit of an insult to loyal fans of the series which is why I can't recommend it.  So what if they are concentrating their efforts on the new next gen version, if that's the case then the release price of this game should have reflected that. It's a very lazy 'update' that is made apparent when you first see your car being pushed back into the garage. The guy standing at the front of the car is pushing last years model and his hands are more than a foot away from the new cars and is very offputting, immediately detracting from any realism you were hoping to feel. AI is just as dumb when it comes to moving off the racing line and will smash into you rather than avoid you if you are going slower on an out lap. The rules can be totally ignored by the AI drivers which is especially evident when there's a safety car out. For example, I'm leading the race and lined up behind the safety car, just going into the final bend where the SC is about to go into the pits, nowhere near the finish/start line. The car in second place speeds past me and I get disqualified for overtaking with a safety car out. So basically it's still plagued by the many bugs/flaws of its predessors and has to rank among the laziest 'updates' I've ever played, yet still I enjoy the game. Weird I know but that's how it is. 
1589	0	a	At this point in time I can not recommend the game due to its poor wheel support I was hoping for a lot more in a way of settings I have full rig and this game does not use my setups full potential.  I spent close to an hour trying to find a suitable setting through the game and through the profiler with no luck.  I thought 2014 may be a little different to the rest but its pretty much the same just with a make over and some new tracks  I will follow codemasters and see if they tweak the wheel support feels like the game is more controller based  If it's on special grab it but at the current price unless you're a dedicated F1 fan it's not worth the money   I will update and change review if anything changes but for now wait for F1 2015
1590	0	a	This game totally makes you miss f1 2012 or f1 2013 ( KERS button ruined this game), 2015 doesn't seem any better, MP problems are just the beginning, Codemaster is a master at getting rich every year off F1...If your a fan of F1 get it, If not F1 2012 is still the best one....
1591	0	a	Turned off all assists after the initial test lap.  The feeling that I was playing anything even remotely like an F1 simulator was just not there.  26 minutes later, asked for a refund.  Avoid.  
1592	0	a	I was looking forward to playing this game but now I am really disappointed. Why? This is really a backwards by code masters. I hope there is much improvement s in the 2016 game.
1593	0	a	game constantly freezes
1594	0	a	Steering with Keybaord is horrible compared to F1 2012.
1595	0	a	Unplayable if you've only got a joystick or a keyboard - your control will be very unstable and you'll end up spinning your car around and hitting the barriers like an idiot. You need to buy a wheel which cost £80 at least to get an actual racing experience.
1596	0	a	Absolutely terrible port of this game, a ton more effort should have been put in. Even the default key bindings were mind boggling, and the just assume you're going to use an Xbox 360 controller, um well what if I want to use one of the most common peripherals for a computer instead, aka the ♥♥♥♥ing keyboard.   Oh well. I do like the game, but don't waste your money on it... I hope they actually make a PC version of the 2015 edition, rather than just port it over. 
1597	0	a	  Now I don't play many racing games on my PC (long live the xbox360) but my buddy shared this with me from the family thing and I thought I would give it a go, now the last f1 racer was the Codemasters/ego 2011 game and to accounts the only things better is the textures and updated team drivers..  The power unit sound is just a loud high pitched whine. the braking actually works but the steering is now bs (playing with a keyboard) so good work the worst and the best part of 2011 game has been swapped. Where did the honest career mode campaign mode go?  Maybe it's just being on a PC (that far outstrips my old console) but it seems as a game far worse than 2011 f1. There are plenty of improvements from the radio calls to the degradation and picking up marbles, to the new animations to how you react to impacts.  maybe I just like the sport itself too much, or the old game but that's my opinion, if ya want it to take it if not **** of
1598	0	a	A reskinned version of 2013 with little to no improvements. Uses the same outdated game engine of 2013 just with a different paint coat. Even the devs admited this years version was a reskin push out that they spent little time or effort on to focus on the new next gen game engine that '15 and '16 use. Also lacks the force feedback and wheel weight for newer wheels (g29 / ts300 ect) just like 2013 does.  All in all, at this point 2014 is a pointless title that doesn't substancially improve on 2013 and is inferiour to 2015+ (ESP '16) in every single aspect from graphics to espcially car simulation, handling, braking, AI, tire ware, fuel consumption, weight transfer, ect ect. If you have a newer wheel like g29 / ts300 that work with the next gen consoles then you can forget F1 titles prior to 2015 (the first next gen only f1 title) as the force feedback doesn't work with the last gen games ('14 and eariler).  Now that 2016 is out it puts this and all previous titles to shame in every way, but especially this one as '14 is by far the worst of them. If you want the full, most immersive F1 experience, with the best features, then get '16.
1599	0	a	Don't be stupid like I am and buy this game. No, seriously, it's horrible. Same can be said for 2015, which is so much worse. I'm giving Codies a last chance with 2016, or I will demand they hand their F1 license over to another dev. But yeah, not much to say, apart from it being a patched F1 2013. And there's barely anything new, if any.
1600	0	a	In a stub: + Graphics are awesome - The physics engine is absolutely rubbish, the handling is not at all convincing!  DO NOT BUY any of the Codemasters' if you are looking for a realistic racing experience.  My story/comments: For a long time I've been playing Grand Prix 3 &amp; 4. I like a realistic racing sim, and these games really hit the mark in physics, although the graphics are outdated. As such, I had tried a demo of F1 2012 a few years ago and recalled I didn't like the handling, but I did appreciat the graphics and detail. As such I thought I'd give Codemasters another go and bought F1 2014.   On the plus side, the graphics are amazing even at lower settings, and the attention to details off-track (such as entering &amp; exiting the car) are nice additions that could make a very realistic experience.  That said, the basics that the racing experience should build on are - in my opinion - rubbish. Of course I have not driven real F1 cars, but the physics just don't add up to something that represents reality.  I tried the standard settings, but also spent numerous hours trying to adjust the handling with the options that are handed to the user. My experience is as follows, using a pistol grip RC racing transmitter: - The steering in-game is considerably slower than my steering input, as if there is a maximum steering input speed. This makes for a dead and disconnected feel to the car and I have to start judging how fast the game will allow me to turn in in order to hit the apex. The appropriate way to go about things is to make the car respond as quickly as I do, at which point the car will respond quickly but (likely) lose balance with under- or oversteer because in reality the cars are not made to turn in so suddenly. - The throttle is ridiculous: It is all too easy to cause wheelspin, which is logical. However in no way the car can break out at the rear more than +- 15 degrees, so the only consequence of too much throttle is less forward drive. This is very noticable in low-speed and long corners and upon exiting corners. - The brakes are like ABS on your road car: However hard you may try, it is near-impossible to get the wheels to lock up, even at the most unforgiving settings. - Going off track is not an issue because the car is won't destabilize like the real thing. - Contact between cars or cars and trackside objects is not convincing: Not only are the cars stronger than they should be, the impacts don't show any sort of absorption, deformation or anything: It's like Codemasters re-invented pong with high resolution rendering.  The F1 2012 demo had similar issues, and funnily enough the last Codemasters racing simulator I tried before that (DTM Race Driver 3) had similar issues too. I don't know how they do it, but it's messed up that a game from more than 10 years earlier outperforms their game in how realistic the handling feels. The impression it left on me is that I don't ever have to bother with racing simulators by Codemasters ever again; I'll stick with Geoff Crammond's awesome 'GP4' and with the 'Race' series by SimBin.
1601	0	a	I used to like this game so I got a wheel and pedals. *Turns off all assists. *Feathers throttle. Spin. *Turns on TC.
1602	0	a	In 30 hours of gameplay my carreer savegame got corrupted 3 times and I had to star all over again!! Never again!!
1603	0	a	The grip is terrible holy ♥♥♥♥ im on legend and using a mclaren with mix 3 fuel but ♥♥♥♥ I'm still getting 22th in austrialia cause of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ grip.
1604	0	a	Still has bugs (lost chars)
1605	0	a	A faithful port of F1 racing, just not a game I care to pick up again.
1606	0	a	DO NOT BUY THIS GAME It's another copy and paste. Codemasters don't care about F1, they care about a profit and thats why they gave us this terrible game. I REAPEAT DO NOT BUY!
1607	0	a	*sigh*  Can't help but feel a bit ripped off by this.  Apart from a new circuit and different car models/sounds, there is little to no other difference.  The game engine must be exactly the same. Penaltys are no different - still as awful as last years game. Blue flags are terrible.  The garage crew are exactly the same as last year. I know this obviously doesn't effect how the game plays... but it does show how lazy Codemasters have been. They must be laughing their heads off this year and calling their buying audiance utter mugs.  Glad I only paid 20 quid via CJS Keys.
1608	0	a	I paid for the game after checking my laptop was capable of runnig the game but when it loaded the first part loads and then i am left with a black screen, cant work out why cant find a fix either, cant work out whats going wrong
1609	0	a	The game says it is trying to open, it gets to the first loading page then crashes and kicks you out of the game.
1610	0	a	I'm so done with this game...
1611	0	a	Very bad game.
1612	0	a	Well where do I start. I think ill just emphasise on two to three main points here. #1 Im 22 races into Career mode, I havent had one single circuit without rain in either Prac, Qualifying, Racing. Annoying as hell. #2 Everytime i come in for a pit stop, i get held up to about 7+ seconds, and cars that entered the pit lane 3 seconds behind me get out in front. CONSTANTLY. #3 On Expert AI, I can outrace by 20-40seconds by the end of a 50% race. In Legend mode, i get beat by 20seconds+. Thought it was ment to adjust to your skill level. Overall, Consistantly bad. But I play anyway.
1613	0	a	If you are a wheel user who is happy to pay for what is essentially the same experience as F1 2013 (and one that has arguably less content) but with the new cars and tracks, then F1 2014 might be for you.  However, if you use a controller then steer clear, do not waste your money! The handling model is ruined in this one. Driver aids are forced upon you and it makes everything drive like junk. This is applicable to you whether you used assists before or not. Though if you didn’t use assists then the difference is even more aggravating. All the nice driving feel is gone. For them to claim this was in the name of accessibility is just baffling. The games have always had options to turn assists on for new players. Why couldn’t these new assists be included in said options? How does it make sense to force them upon people who purposefully turn assists off!?  What is left is a game where driving is a chore not a challenge. The cars feel awful but at the same time you will find it hard to ever spin or lock a tire. Instead you will be stuck throwing yourself into corners like an idiot because the traction control will just do the work for you, otherwise you can’t keep up. Driving fast with a controller in this game feels like cheating and going back to 2013 I was well aware of how much worse of a driver it had made me.  In terms of content the only real addition is a shortened career mode, in which you advance through teams by setting their drivers as rivals and beating them in a best of 3 races. I actually think this is pretty cool and I hope it stays in the series. Apart from that everything is the same but they cut the classic cars and tracks, along with a lot of the new driver testing stuff.   This is what you get when you take a franchise that already struggles for new content because of its annual release schedule, then tell the developers they actually have less time than usual because their 2015 version needs to be next gen and released early than usual. Hopefully it makes up for this mess.  Skip this one. 
1614	0	a	Excluding 2010 (GFWL), 2011 (GFWL), &amp; 2015 (mess):  2014 is best for beginners  2013 is best for hobbyists.  2012 is best for money savers __________________________________  About 2014 specifically:  + Good graphics + Good gameplay and difficulty options (accessible to everyone) + Streamlined interface (accessible to everyone) + Small download   - Harder to find multiplayer sessions if you live in North America (even if you change region, due to far apart time zones).  - Racenet login issue in-game (despite being registered)
1615	0	a	I would not buy this game, it is boring and repetitive, even if you are a true racing fanatic, this game is not for and could be considered as a waste of time and money foe some people, there are much better racing titles for the price
1616	0	a	download 2 mods, debug and f1 2016 mod.   attempt 1: IT ♥♥♥♥ING CRASHES AFTER LOADING THE RACE.  attempt 2: IT CRASHES AFTER LEAVING PITLANE FOR THE GRID attempt 3: (removed mods) IT CRASHED AGAIN GSJGFSDIJG&lt;ILDJF&lt;LGDF&lt;JGLDFJ   overall i rate 1/10, used to be 7/10
1617	0	a	This game is exactly the same as the last one, oh no wait, it's even worse! The only thing they've changed is the sounds and have made the cars handle rubbish! This is definitely the worse F1 game ever made, I prefered playing F1 2009 on my PSP and that was awful. The AI seems fine in Career hovever, on co-op they seem so OP that you can never seem to keep up! It's the same with general online multiplayer but it seems to be the opposite of co-op as when the cars are set to legend they seem to work as if they are set to amatuer. This is not a years worth of work really disappointed! Wait until F1 2015 guys see if it's any better!  Update:  F1 2015 is just as ♥♥♥♥ as this game...  Update: F1 2016 is also a ♥♥♥♥ game do not buy...  Update:  F1 2017 is also a wank game...  Update:  F1 2018 is just awful. CodeMasters should just die...
1618	0	a	Played this game for a few Hrs. This game looks and plays very similar to F1 2013 but without the classic tracks and cars. If you already own F1 2013 then there is nothing much to get from this game as all the features and interface look 100% similar. In game graphics is good but the cars sound average.  I played this game using a gamepad, the car doesn’t handle that well in wet conditions, and there is too much power applied unnecessarily which results in the rear wheels spinning. Also, there is no KERS activation button in this game. It is automatically applied as and when necessary.  F1 2013 was a great game and still costs more than this version. If you own that then there is no point in buying the 2014 version unless you want to drive on the Russian GP track. This game is good for first time F1 game buyers.
1619	0	a	Drivinig is not that realistic.......response time is a little slow.
1620	0	a	Garbage.  The game doesn't run on Windows 10, apparently. I've tried reinstalling, verifying game files, backing up and restoring. There's absolutely zero movement from Codemasters on this.  Not impressed.
1621	0	a	also the place, game bags have gone from a stim in ps4, to you there, from nothing pulls extensively. The developer and codemasters-you are pidoras
1622	0	a	I was very disappointed to find that this is very much an arcade style racing game. I wish they're was a way to completely turn off all the assists, meaning even with the assists turned off in the game menu I can definetely still feel the traction control preventing wheel spin.  Setting up my T500 will take hours of frustrating testing and tweaking to make it feel like I'm acctually in control of these cars. Code Masters? More like Code ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. They've butchered something with great potential by ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥izing the controls and not spending the time to make it feel real.   If you're a 10 year old boy with a game pad, you're gonna love this game. If you're looking for a serious F1 racing experience, look somewhere else.
1623	0	a	I award this game the 'Worse than CoD' award for recycling not only 2013 in general, but for uses the exact same steering wheel on ALL cars except the RB10 and STR9, along with using LAST YEARS STEERING WHEEL on the Williams.  This game is a pathetic cash grab and I feel stupid for trusting that it wouldn't be terrible.  Wait for 2015, then wait a week to put down your money on the game.  edit: In response to comments.  Cars handle practically the same as 2013, not a huge night and day difference like it was between '12 and '13. Not enough there to make it a standout point.  No the steering wheels are NOT exactly the same in real life. The electronics behind the systems ARE (provided by Mclaren) but the actual physical designs are NOT.  Yes i WILL knock Codemasters for not doing their ♥♥♥♥ing job properly. Yes i WILL knock them for not even ♥♥♥♥ing bothering to remain faithful to the sport in a game where 90% of ALL of 2013 is literally copy/pasted. And no i can't recommend this game on that basis because you're giving Codemasters 50 bucks for a ctrl+C/V.
1624	0	a	After buying this game i reckon i should get a free trial of 2015,cos for 50 bucks if 2015 is anything like this game i would want my money back, i paid 20 for this and feel like i'm watching a flame go round a track. what do u reckon codemasters like my code?  As an update to my comment about F1 2015,everyone says not recommended,as i thought,so glad i didnt buy it,hence the comments made here as i cannot review a game i dont own,dont own so very happily.Looks like the only thing codemasters is working on in F1 is reverse gear,they are going backwards with this title,its getting worse,and codemasters keep taking our money thinking 'hey this must be a good game, people are still buying it'. When will we all learn!!!!!
1625	0	a	Steam is asking me if i would recommend this game. It's hard to recommened wheteher or not to buy this game while these circumstances are messing up with my joy while playing this game. First of all if you are looking for a simulator then this is not a game for you. Even on the hardest difficulty it is very easy to over pass your opponents like if you would be racing on the easiest settings and when it comes for your opponent to overtake you it's nearly impposible for them to do that unless you make a mistake your self. This game needs hell of improvments when it comes to the AI and the most dissapointing thing and which makes me rather say 'do not buy this game' is that the F1 franchise is lacking on new content. I can assume this game is almost the same thing just as F1 2011 if i don't include in the new main menu, challenges, graphics and drivers and teams. On the other hand graphics are impressive and innovative compared to F1 2011. The career mode gave me the feeling as if i would be an athentic Formula 1 driver, but again it's nothing new. That's about it, I can barely find anything that would satisfy me since i have the feeling of playing a recycled game. If you never purchased an F1 game from codies then go for it, I am pretty sure you wont be dissapointed, but if you already did then stick to your older F1 game and you could just get a MOD for the new seasons. You wont be missing out much. As an F1 consumerist i sense this is a recycled product (not garbage, just recycled), so just go get an older F1 game and say NO to this one.
1626	0	a	The game will not work with Fanatec wheel . Steam is such a bad site to get any help with . now with a tx wheel settings always change
1627	0	a	I'm a massive F1 fan, I use a G27 wheel. I play a variety of racing games including iRacing, F1 2013 and Asseto Corsa on a semi-regular basis.  Codemasters, is a large company with many years of experience.  Given that. I should not be able to real of a list of things they should have done better.  The Williams livery - no excuse, I should not have to mod an official F1 game (there are already several good mods for this) so that I can have the cars look like they do in real life. It's absolutely ridiculous.  The AI - Far worse an effort than last year, the AI feel like they are driving completely different cars to me, at some parts they brake way later than I can, at others, they have so much more grip they must have made their cars from magnets and put iron in the roads. They catapult themselves between far too aggressive and far too meek, almost bi-polar even.  In 3 months there will be several high quality AI mods and this complaint will be rendered null, but I shouldn't have to wait until a modder, on his own time makes a mockery of codemasters.  The performance - My graphics card is overheating on high settings.  Well obviously you say, get a better graphics card! Well, yeah, that too. But I've been playing the older games on the very highest settings, including using graphics enhancing mods and they look ab-so-lute-ly gorgeous. Surely, SURELY I should be able to make use of the same level of graphics? No, I absolutely can't, not only that, but they are significantly worse, the reflections are blocky and the colouration is distorted, the mirrors remind me of my N64 (yes, I exaggerate, but not by nearly enough) (already there are fixes on the steam forum for this, if users can fix it within a few days, why wasn't it like it in the first place?). It's just plain worse. And given that it's pretty much the same game as last year, I shouldn't have that problem.  Content - Well, we all knew that this was going to be a stop gap until F1 2015. But that doesn't make it better. This feels very slim compared to the earlier titles.  It just frustrates me that these are issues, as sure as the Sun sets there are many other issues, but these strike me in particular as things that are easy to fix, should never have been an issue in the first place or just smack or finances being the goal and not the game.  Having said that, it's not all bad. I like the physics changes... But the bugbears have struck first. 
1628	0	a	Same as F1 2013, only new tracks, new cars, new sounds, some cosmetic changes. Same (old) engine as F1 2013.
1629	0	a	DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOUR USING WINDOWS 10 ---------------------------------------------------  Do not buy not just F1 2014, but any other F1 game if your on Windows 10 especially if your using gamepad as your diving controller. For gamepad users, I assure you everytime you play this game you will get this bug/glitch where your car suddenly starts to move either to the left/right (commonly right). I\'m not fully blaming Codemaster for this bug/glitch, I started to suspect Windows 10 that might cause this problem. Overall the game looks pretty cool, I thank the person who made the graphics look so realistic also the detail in the car, crowd, grass, circuit, etc. Sadly I can\'t give a good review about the game until either Microsoft or Codemaster fix this tiny problem. Remember that many people put a lot of effort into this game! Bought a steering wheel, upgrade their RAM so they can play the game lagless, wasting their time eventhough there are important things to do, and so much more just for a game.  Anyway if your using Windows below 10, I can promise you that this and all F1 games works perfect and smoothly (if you have the minimum specs of course). Peace Out!
1630	0	a	The worst racing game I've ever played. Desync and sidepod glitches still plague online races and the cars are not realistic or fun to drive at all.   This video showed my first impressions, but since then these views have changed hugely:         YouTube™ Video:  F1 2014 - Day One Review!&nbsp;
1631	0	a	If you've played any of the other offerings in this series then this incarnation will be largely familiar. While the handling is quite different and does reflect some of the changes in the 2014 season you could just be driving the old V8s as the developers haven't bothered to implement the more refined features of the 2014 engines. In fact, there are fewer engine features in this game than in the previous games. Now you've just got the loud pedal, the stop pedal and DRS. There's no implementation of boost or energy recovery, something that seems to be a key factor for the real cars. Whether the developers didn't have access to this sort of information, thought it would be too complex for the average gamer or were just too lazy to put it into the game it does mean that if you're thinking of upgrading to the latest version to get the features of the 2014 spec engines then you're going to be disappointed. If you're happy to carry on with the V8s and an earlier driver line up then hang onto your cash and wait for the new technologies to be properly developed.
1632	0	a	Can't even get the game to work. Keeps crashing to desktop and no matter what I try to do to fix it it doesn't work. Read so many forums about F1 2014 CTDs but nothing seems to make a difference. Waste of my time and money.
1633	0	a	If i could get my money back i would.  There are no multiplayer matches avaialable and it's doesn't support head tracking???
1634	0	a	Having had a comparision to a long history of F1 Games from early atari via the penical of Geoff Crammond's masterpieces and lows like Alain Prost's racing all the way through to the current crop you can assume two things. I love driving games, especially simulations, and I am a bit of a mug, as I buy (almost) all of them. Seeing the progression of Codemaster efforts I can't help but shake the feeling that they are fallowing the market, no doubt backed up by the in game logging system that shows them statistical distributions of which features are used how often and so on. I am not sure that works for me.   In short: This game is great for casual to intermediate racers, but the simplification of the game has taken a lot of the simulation feel away. Please buy it if this is your first go, or if you prefer your racing fast, furious and not too serious/dull. It is definitly great fun and even a bit of a simulation. Having said that, don't be a mug and buy it if you own 2013. Just don't!  Long version: On the positive side I think F1 2014 is making a good stab at recreating the new feel of F1. Squeeling tyres, odd engine noises and the changed breaking distances are all reflected. In addition the racing is very emersive and overall the game gives you a good race in most scenarios. For example I expected the new track in Russia to be boring as F1 drivers stated that the simulator didn't represent the real fun of the track, as it flowed much nicer in reality. However when I started timed laps around it I got into a rythm pretty quickly and before long really enjoyed the track, which can only mean one thing: Nice job Coders :)  When starting the game you get a nice intro (very much like 2013) and all the visuals are at the same level as 2013 with the odd tweek here and there. For example sparks flying from underneath the car are noticable and sometimes really get into your virtual face. The handling is also improved somewhat with a sharper feel, reflecting the oversteer nature of modern F1 cars. Scenario modes are there as before, increasing in difficulty, but if you have played them in 2013, then 2014 doesn't offer anything new. But scenarios are in general good fun. I found the rain / wet track scenario quite hard but that might just be me. Compared to other online racers, who post rediculously high scores, I seem to be middle of the pack.   In a season challange you again get the chance to pick an opponent from anywhere on the grid and as long as you beat them best of 3, then you get their seat. Starting this challange on medium I was surprised to be dumped straight into qualifying on a new track in Austria (although I had vague memories of the layout from F1GP2). Steep learning curve? You bet. Especially for novice drivers. But great fun.    There are some differences that are fairly neutral. No boost button anymore, No gear rations to set and a couple of other minor changes not worth mentioning here. Suffices to say the format of F1 has changed in reality and this game reflects this. But it does lead to less to do and think about. Given that there is little new besides the sound and some drive models I can't shake the feeling that it is too little change for the better. One thing worth mentioning is that if you opt to return to the pits the 2013 version had a nasty habbit of continuing the engine noise. That has been fixed. On the otherhand desperatly trying to switch to a one stop strategy at Imola was impossible, even when calling for option tyres from the car. The pit crew just ignored me forcing me to stop again :(  Pit stops, corner cutting penalties and so on have all be retained although the execution has ever so slightly changed (you can switch this penalty off as well ). And this is where my list of gripes start. This should not be taken too seriously but I was hopping since 2011 that this would be fixed and it still hasn't happened:  I am missing:  1) freedom to set up the car asymetrically (different settings for every corner of the car) 2) What about dampers, gearration at the beginning of the season and so on? 3) The black and white nature of the commentary and news articles (I raced from last to 8th in a caterham on high difficulty level, one place behind my rival (Vettel) and ended up with an animation of my driver shaking his head in dispair - that does kill the mood 4) Why not let us drive the pre-race lap to check out the track? 5) cartoon physics and damage model - I am sick and tired of getting nothing but wing damage. Please sort it and negotiate harder with the FIA. This is probably one of my major gripes, especially since it now includes mid air drifting when jumping shikanes (you can try this on most 90 degree corners). It is also still true that in a pile up cars have a tendency to 'stick together' because the collision detection still does not resolve object interlocking correctly (In the real world two objects hitting each other end up repelling each other, but not here). This has been a basic 3D Vector coding problem since the 1990s, and while some games have managed to solve this, codemasters is alas still stuck in the past (although it is not ruining the game!).  6) The AI still has major flaws around lapping (slowing on the racing line most of the times when met in corners) and their tendency to drive into you from behind at the start of races is also somewhat annoying (of course with no penalty). 7) Can we have a story line please? You sort of had a half hearted story in an earlier version but killed it.  8) Please give us better grafics than the playstation. We can handle it. 9) I would like testing (could also be the tsrat of the story line) - especially pre-season to help with developing the car in a direction I like.  10) accuracy of the penalty system is still poor. Sorry, but if 2 wheel are still on the road (U-Turn in Canada) even if the other two are not, then there should be no penalty - just as an example.  11) Career progression is unrealistic. If you drive the socks of a Caterham and continously put it in the top 10 over 5 races in the season you will be offered a contract by one of the top 3 teams. But not in this game.  12) What about two way communications around pit stops? Please fix that and enhance so that when tyre wear is low the pit might ask how it is going? How about having multiple race stratregies amd an option to switch to plan C?  Therew are many more wishes, but the above could all have been done with a little bit more work and they are not ground breaking either. All in all this is a genuine attempt at getting something new represented in the F1 world, but the price does not reflect the changes made, which are overall minor tweeks. Not all of them to my liking. Simply put, by going after a broader appeal Simulation fans have ended up loosing out again. That is frustrating to say the least. It feels shallower and the physics execution is more like TOCA then F1. I still can't feel the build up of downforce as the speed increasese, and I can't gain a tenth here and there by doing very carful car set-ups.    I know that is not what thew majority seems to want, but then this is my review and they can write theirs.   Dear Codmasters:  Please rework the phsyics from scratch (car, damage, collision, the lot).  Please give us more simulation options that make real differences on how the car feels, and  bring us a propper career story line.  Yours faithfully  Chris (F1 simulation addict)
1635	0	a	Buggier than F1 2013 which was already bad. Online play is just stupid with all the bugs and the random lag.
1636	0	a	im sure theres a game here somware
1637	0	a	Game cant even launch it crash everytime again and again Steam tries to relaunch it and i get like 22 crash dumps in my steam folder , i realy wanne play it!!!!! tried reinstalling steam ect
1638	0	a	every time i play this game something always happen it just keeps on quiting and playing i did not press anything and sometimes when its fullscreen it just exit immediately
1639	0	a	F1 2014 is a bleak version of F1 2012/2013. Effects and Graphics less polished. Game engine seems more forgiving and noobish even on hardest difficulty with all driving assists off. Embarrassing really. Hopefully Codemasters come back with good versions on the new consoles this year. In the meantime, buy and play F1 2013.
1640	0	a	This game i may say if something i don't want to waste my time with as i am a pad user Yes sure pad users have better traction but we under steer like crazy, so this game is by far more worse than 2013. it would be nice though that in 2015 there would a fair balance between pad and wheel user. through out the past 3 games there has been something wrong with it. F1 2012- if you was to go online you would actually find out that the Sauber is Faster in equal car performance F1 2013- the pad users had a better steering input thus saving tyre life which was a BIG thing for the game F1 2014- the wheel seems to be Superior than the pad.  please make f1 2015 far more better and make it equal just please other wise you could be losing a fan
1641	0	a	Being a Huge f1 fan i was really looking forward to playing 2014, first of all i was disapointed they had dropped classics mode from 2013 witch i found to be alot of fun. 2014 is basically a stop gap untill the next gen graphics engine gets used in 2015:  PROS: New circuit to race on  CONS: Poor graphics Bad Physics Cars feel really slow  To be honest this game could of been a dlc for 2013. hope this helps guys and girls 
1642	0	a	To begin, I am a major Formula 1 fan and usually pick up the game every other year to see all of the major changes for the games. I started with F1 2010 on the xbox 360 and then F1 2012 on the 360 before finally making it to F1 2014 on the PC.  Pros: - Runs at a solid 60+ fps 1080p while recording - Graphics appear to have become better since 2012 (although i was on console for that) - Learning curve is reasonable. You can pick up the game fairly easy and every couple of races you can turn up the difficulty a little bit or turn off some assists to get better. - You get to experience the new turbo F1 cars.  Cons: - One major graphical error that bothers me to no end is that fact that when you are in the 'TV Pod' camera mode as well as the driver's camera mode, the mirrors provide you with absolutely no information. The mirrors look like they came straight out of pole position. Legitemately, the reflection of cars in the side mirrors give you no benefit because pole position had better graphics detail and animation. - Home menu and submenus not necessarily the most intuitive - After exiting fullscreen through an Alt+Tab, the game cannot be put into fullscreen mode again without exiting game and launching game again (this may only be a problem for me but, I have to launch it using Nvidia Geforce Experience or it won't be fullscreen at all) - It's the same game as years prior (Coming from 2012 to 2014 and from console to PC, the only difference I notice is the graphics, the cars are supposed to feel completely different and be harder to drive with the new regulation changes, but I feel as though I'm still driving the 8 cylinder naturally aspirated F1 car with blown diffusers from 2010 and 2012.)  Overall: If this is you first game in the F1 series, get it. If you already have a game but are looking for an updated version with an all new feel, don't. The game is a Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V of previous years. Unfortunately this is the Madden of racing games and I don't see the game changing this pattern in the near future.  Graphics: 6/10 Sound: 8/10 New Features: 0/10 Overall Quality for New Player: 7/10 Overall Quality for Returning Player: 4/10
1643	0	a	Career mode sucks. You can't adjust your car in the way you want. Car loses its stability during season etc...  They tried to make something good but in the end it became something bad.   Previous F1's are better such as 11
1644	0	a	After playing F1 2013 i thougt that the F1 2014 would be better, but this was only a dream. I shift gears with using the engine sounds and there aren't good or useful engine sounds, you dont hear when you can shift, you must look when you have to shift. and the traction controls are awkard as much.
1645	0	a	What the actual ♥♥♥♥ is with this ffb? it's almost undriveable like this turning of every assist and yet i seems to auto turn and randomly starts turning when going in a straight line etc. what the hell.
1646	0	a	Thank you for another broken game. Is that all is being released nowaday?
1647	0	a	BUY 2013 INSTEAD!!!!  As a huge fan an owner of F1 2010, F1 2011, F1 2012 and F1 2013 I have to say that this game is downright awful.  - Rain raices are literally impossible  -&gt; Seriously, spend 5 hours on finding a setup, and AI still is always 2 seconds faster  -&gt; Spin out all the time, even with an analog controller and wheels/pedals. 1% Throttle = too much  - Penalties are still ridiculous  -&gt; AI crashes into you in a corner - you get a penalty  - Annoying graphic bugs  -&gt; Reflections in mirrors are lowest quality and have color issues  -&gt; Rosbergs car (no. 6) behind you? Reflection shows Hamiltons car (no. 44)  - Wheel support is lousy   -&gt; Force feedback is horrible, unplayable with a Thrustmaster T500 RS  - No updates since day 1, and none to come  -&gt; Developers are lazy and refusing to fix this mess  - AI still too stupid to pass you   Bottom line: Stay away from this piece of ♥♥♥♥.
1648	0	a	It's ok, but I wouldn't advise you to get it if you are only going to play it once in a while. The career mode is exactly the same bar some feature that shortens the season - who is going to use that? Online at the moment is more laggy than it was last year, but I should imagine they will fix that. Quick race, proving grounds and a pointless evaluation test are what it says on the tin. It goes without saying that Codemasters are clearly focusing on their new 'engine' for 2015, however for 30 pounds i was expecting a little more than an update from 2013 which only adds 2 new tracks takes away classics and gives us the seasons cars, drivers etc.  As a conclusion, I was expecting more from 2014, however my enjoyment from the game is still pleasing in my perspective. 2015 will be a decider if Codemasters can cut the mark on the 'next gen' games market and I am very much looking forward to the game coming out.

1650	0	a	I expected this to be less arcade-like on the highest 'difficulty setting'. Physics are non-existing, quite a disappointment is an understatement here. Oh well, at least this allows me to memorize Tilke layouts before actual GP weekends...
1651	0	a	Very dissapointed in this game, its just a Copy &amp; Paste from F1 2013 with 2 new tracks, and new V6 engine sounds. Not worth the price tag it was selling at. If you have F1 2013 dont bother buying this version as you will be sadly dissapointed.
1652	0	a	Got this one cheap, wouldn't have bought it for it's full price, since I already have F1 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013. If you have 2013 I can't recommend this, if you don't.. get the cheapest from 2011 to 2014. Personally I still find 2012 to be the best out of the series.
1653	0	a	FIX THE GAME
1654	0	a	If you just want a f1 game, this one just fine. If you want a sim f1 game, this one is a piece of ♥♥♥♥.
1655	0	a	SP is unplayable. AI is behaving so randomly, it's ridiculous. I reduced assists more and more, and am now at expert difficulty with Toro Rosso, it's always the same.  Cars in front are impossible to keep up with during the race (doesn't matter if I'm 5th or 15th, my position just depends on the first few corners, with Toro Rosso it could be anything from 1st to 18th....). I probably use DRS once a race. But there's always one car in my 1s DRS window behind me. The cars behind me push ALL the time no matter what tyres, no matter how many laps they already have on the tyres, no matter how fast I'm actually going or what setup I have.  They hop on the brakes at least 50m too early but suddenly have amazing grip and acceleration out of the corner. Again it doesn't matter what tyres/setup/car and so on.  What a mess.  Just to play with my X360 controller I had to switch to 'other controller' or something... suddenly I had so much more control, I could turn difficulty up by two levels............

1657	0	a	I've played this for about 100 hours now, its not good, lets just leave it at that.
1658	0	a	Wait for the new 2015 game same as the last one.
1659	0	a	This was the biggest waste of money i've spent on a game.
1660	0	a	This game is very bad worse then 2013.  Codemasters should be ashamed of them selfs.  This is just a reskin with a big price tag, all the bugs are still there. There working on 2015 so thats why nothing was put in to this game but what i seen from the leaked 2015 images its looking 2015 will be a reskin with higher res graphics with the same game engine.  To be honest Codies should lose the contract for F1 games there so bad.
1661	0	a	I'm not a fan of F1. I just wanted to see how it is to drive such a car. It broke my nerves so much that all I wanted was to uninstall it to revenge. A game is to have fun. This is not one of them. Don't get me wrong. For those who play the series maybe it's ok. But after 18 times the same race (couse i wanted really bad to beat my rival) i managed to be 4th, last lap and out of nowhere, with zero speed, i got out of the way and turned over, that was the last thing i could stand. RIP F1
1662	0	a	THIS GAME IS THE BIGGEST ♥♥♥♥ EVER!!! DONT BUY IT!!!
1663	0	a	bULL SCHITH--IM LOST 10 PLACE FROM PENALTY SECEND UALIFY--BUT FAY--NO BLOCKING-NO RAMMING--THIS BULL SHITH--I SMILE--BUT THIS IS --IM DOMINATION THIS SESSION--THATS fia..:D 
1664	0	a	the sound of the car is sooo bad!!! dont like this game
1665	0	a	im not impressed with the online play as no one seems to be online, almost impossible to find a race i have had the game for 4 days and probly only raced 5 races online
1666	0	a	3/10
1667	0	a	awful game not worth it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1668	0	a	I played this game for a very long time and could never get used to the handling model. They textures were pretty poor and so was the force feedback. The in-game wheel movement was disorientating and the whole thing ran poorly.
1669	0	a	Do NOT BUY this game. UNLESS if you have wheel, but this game isn't very good for PC AND keyboard. Waste of money.. I actually thought this game would support keyboard but turns out they don't support keyboard very much.. And it is hard to steering too.
1670	0	a	This game is no where near as fun as the first one. I played it for 10 minutes before i couldnt stand it anymore. the car feels like it is perfectly attached to the road. it feels as if its on a rail or something and you have no clue as to the speed that you're traveling. F1 2013 had none of these problems. it allowed the players to feel as though they are one with the cars. and feel the sensation of speed. F1 2014 is not at this same level of quality. It feels like an unfinished game, that was rushed out early.
1671	0	a	When NPC's crash into you, you get a ♥♥♥♥ing penalty
1672	0	a	WARNING The game requires Gamespy servers for online play. Server were permantly turned off 31st May 2014. This is no longer a fully functional product.
1673	0	a	This game is kinda bad, it feels extremely choppy and it's showing high framerates, the bike physics and mechanic really suck. If you're looking for a MX game look into THQ's MX vs ATV, much better game.
1674	0	a	Pretty crappy game compared to Reflex, only graphics are good and one track (Lommel). Got it for 3$ it's about how much it's worth. No fun, poor mechanincs.
1675	0	a	Launcher does nothing but crash even after re-install and tweaking. I have a very robust machine that would eat this game. Wouldnt waste the money
1676	0	a	Does not supprt HD7970 Graphics card. Can not play.
1677	0	a	this games keeps crashing everytime at the point of loading a race
1678	0	a	I want my money BACK !!! This game is not a motocross game ! this is a normaly race game -_-
1679	0	a	Terrible control, bad graphics, don't recommended.
1680	0	a	I dont recommend this game because it is so cartoony and i reget getting it you are better off with mx vs. atv. you have to buy tricks! you should just learn them not buy the tricks. i have had this game for about 1 hour and i reget everything about this game. if you want a dirt bike game... MX VS. ATV not this crappy mud game.
1681	0	a	Ew, awful game. Dumb silly things like boosts and only being able to 'scrub' on certain jumps. Overall, if you want an excellent motocross game, ANY MX vs ATV game will suffice. Literally any of them. To drive the point home, REFLEX : 10/10, Supercross : 9/10. Unleashed : 10/10, MXGP : 7.5 / 10, MUD : 3/10. I'm so happy i was able to get a refund.
1682	0	a	buggy and clumsy
1683	0	a	Holy ♥♥♥♥ this game was awful, I regret my 2 minutes playing this piece of ♥♥♥♥ already.
1684	0	a	this game isnt great reaction response is really bad and im not going to talk about the grafics or i will become angry. don't buy this guys
1685	0	a	This game is mud or dog poo.
1686	0	a	MUD spelled backwards is DUM. MX vs ATV is way better.
1687	0	a	Might be ok if you only want to use a keyboard, but with a joystick it is not enjoyable.
1688	0	a	felt and looked like it was made by a 12year old using 'coding for dummies' abosulute ♥♥♥♥, do not reccomend
1689	0	a	its allright but i dont like it that much
1690	0	a	Terrible...... Worst Physics possible.. absolute trash
1691	0	a	WORST MX GAME EVER! IT'S SOOO BAD, CAN'T BELIEVE!
1692	0	a	The game crashes immediately on start up.
1693	0	a	horrible if its under the 2 hour mark refund it. if you like horrible arcade moto games and free aids the go ahead and get it anyways
1694	0	a	Game does not work. It crashes on the race load screen. .......................................................................................................................................................Ok going back and reading some stuff online for some reason this game is crashing on the race load screen for alot of people and the only way to fix it is to turn the audio off in the initial load screen. I guess this game would be alright if it actually functioned and had some kind of support. the graphics are ok and it supports controller play.

2966	0	a	The original TrackMania games were damned amazing and had a great following with tons of servers full of thousands of players at any given time of day. For the last ten months, the new TrackMania games have been dead. I paid full price for all three titles, expecting to have an even better time with the new games, because why not?  Well, as the days turned to weeks, I realized the folly of my wasted money as almost all of the servers remained dead across the planet and it continued to be impossible to find a choice of heavily populated servers. Whether it was the dumb choice to milk the players of their cash by splitting the game up into three separate releases (one for each environment) and requiring separate servers for each or if it was the decision to charge money for the new games, at all, the result remains the same -- nobody plays these.  If you reference  SteamCharts  [steamcharts.com]  for Stadium, you'll find that the average number of players at any given time through all of 2013 was between 90 and 190. Across the entire planet - and most usually seem to be overseas (Germany, France, Russia, Spain, the UK), so if you're looking for a populated low-ping server in your region and you're in North America, you're going to have a bad time.  It's a very unfortunate situation. The game looks better than ever and it has a lot of enjoyment to offer if you like this style of game. It's a fantastic time waster when you need a break here and there. However, you ultimately need a player-base for a multi-player game to be enjoyed. Their business and release model for this series of games completely failed in this way, this time around.  Here's to hoping they give the franchise another shot in a couple more years and they correct their mistakes.
2967	0	a	Trackmania Sunrise came out in 2005. Ten years later, this game is pretty much the same - not any better.  There's a reason it's cheap.  I wish I'd spent a little more for Canyon or Valley.
2968	0	a	Beware: Nobody plays this game online. Only abt 100 people. If you're looking for the old fun times, they're not here. Actually claiming this still being an online multiplayer is bending the truth.
2969	0	a	 '5 reasons why 'Celebrat10n TrackMania2 Pack' is a disappointment!'
2970	0	a	The price you're going to pay will be for the service of Maniaplanet that offers you editor plugins, import of custom blocks, creation of title packs, monthly updates etc. that weren't available in the free version.  So if you're going to use any of those services, the price will be worth, otherwise you will waste money to be in a version less crowded than the free version.  Note that TMN ESWC servers are still open and that if you want to play TMN Forever without FreeZone you need to buy TMU Forever for 30 €. As some reviews, this is for the fans of the serie, if you only enjoy driving on your own maps, keep playing on the free version.
2971	0	a	It's literally the same thing as Trackmania Nations Forever, which is still available on Steam and completely free.  I guess if you really want to play a free game but in HD, go for it.  Oh wait, no. Don't actually. Install the demo, it allows you to play on official servers and compete in official maps. You'll pretty much get the full experience that way. If you really want to buy a Trackmania title, try one of the other Trackmania2 games. Canyon in particular has a neat drifting gimmick and looks a lot more visually interesting.
2972	0	a	It is just TrackMania Nations Forever with 'improved' graphics.  I hardly call it 'improved' because it is released in 2013 but there is no major graphics upgrade, only more sparkles, better sunlight, shadow effects. Other than that, there is nothing special.  But the bad thing is the textures. The textures look extremely pixelated on 1080p, HORRIBLE. And this is why this game disappointed me so much.
2973	0	a	I brought this game years ago and now i can't play the game after it was brought out by ubisoft they reckon i dont own or have a key then how was i able to write a review i have tryed trackmanias suport they sent me to ubisoft then i tryed steam i get sent to ubisoft all that ubisoft does is send me my account info that then states i don't own the game or have a key key
2974	0	a	I love Trackmania in all its forms but this particular version is a huge disappointment. Put simply, it doesn't offer anything new over its free-to-play predecessor Trackmania Nations.   There's also the issue that because Nadeo has split the game into three separate versions; Stadium, Canyon and Valley, it has managed to separate the community of players. This has left the multi-player servers somewhat sparsely populated.  In short, if you you're a Trackmania veteran, you don’t need this. If you're new to Trackmania you can play essentially the same game for free, so go and play Nations and see what all the fuss is about.
2975	0	a	Trackmania's uniquely in-depth track creator and rule-of-cool physics could have added up to a great game, but the community has utterly killed it.  I was sold by the demo servers. The tracks were interesting and varied, the atmosphere was one of friendly competition, and even if you lost you still had fun trying to beat your own time. So you buy the game, open the server list and pick the first one that isn't plain black text.  And then it all comes tumbling down.  Half the screen is filled with needless leaderboards, ugly buttons that don't do anything and other pointless bells and whistles. The other half of the screen is a horrifically complex track you'll be lucky to beat even once. Most of the time they're so horrifically cluttered that you need to drive off the track and let a replay show you the path, and that still won't help because the map is 60 seconds of madness and you only have 5 minutes to beat it.  If this were the game the demo claimed it would be, I would wholeheartedly recommend it. But if you're a newcomer to the series who likes the demo version, just keep playing it instead of wasting your money on a game that's been mutated in a demonic, unforgiving shell of its former self.
2976	0	a	If only it didn't crash every 10 minutes it might be a good game.
2977	0	a	I found this terrible because i bought Trackmania Canyon, Valley and Stadium, all of which i downloaded but once trying to play the game, it claims i have to repurchase them since i didn't buy them in the first place according to ManiaPlanet, Which means i wasted money on games that won't work, if someone knows how to fix this, i will much appretiate it.. but for now, i am quite irritated
2978	0	a	  Why should you care about my review?    I am a father of two boys, ages 3 and 6 and hold a BA in Game Design (although I work as a database admin - tough to leave a job of 15 years to pursue the 'dream' of game design with a family to support.) That aside, we use a HTPC with Steam in Big picture Mode launched from XBMC. With a wife and two young ones, everything has to be remote and controller friendly. The games also have to be kid-friendly. If you find yourself in a similar situation and trust the opinion of a trained game designer (but not professionally working at it) - then read on.  edit: since I bought the Trackmania three game pack, I am posting the same review in the other two titles as the pros and cons are the same for all (except for Valley, which has a Con unique to itself.)    Pros    -- The game was cheap. $20 for three games (Stadium, Canyon, and Valley) during the Steam winter sale made this something worth trying out.  -- Despite not having an ESRB rating (that I could find anyway), the games are kid friendly. Physics are loose, no bodies are flying out of cars, you can restart at a spawn point on the track, facing the right way (important for the three year old!) at any time you get stuck. I can start a split-screen game and choose a 'playlist' for the kids to race at the same time. They're happy, I'm happy.  -- The game is fun. Stunts, fast cars, loose physics, respawns, tricky tracks, loop tracks, various difficulties, time trials, medals, rankings. And I haven't even tried actual online multi-player yet. I'm not too interested in that part so I won't review that part of the game at this time.  -- Game runs smooth. I've experienced no crashes (the game software, not cars!), no jerkiness, graphics are decent, controls on a 360 controller are easy enough for the three year old to win races against his big brother occasionally.    Cons    -- The interface is severely lacking. Poor design choices abound. To launch the games, Steam launches another launcher (ManiaPlanet). In this new launcher, you see all three games you purchased (after you installed them all). However, if I click on 'Stadium' from Steam, then decide to play 'Canyon' in the ManiaPlanet (MP) launcher, it says I have to restart the game I want from Steam. What's the point of this extra layer of launcher then? Stupid design.  -- The MP launcher is not controller friendly. This means I have to get the keyboard out just to be able to arrow down to the 'Start Game' button. You can't hit it with ANY button on a controller. Once that's done, you can use the controller in game, but not in this MP launcher.  -- Selecting items using the controller is poor design. Blue text turns a bit 'more blue' or slightly brighter. Arrows that are white turn slightly brighter when selected. The wife and kids can't tell what the heck they're navigating. I know about this and I can barely see this on a 42' screen. It's clear the interface is designed only for mouse. The controller does work, but it's not easy to see the navigation. This means I have to setup the game for the kids. I have to get them into the tracks, I have to change playlists (or games if they want to play Stadium for instance.)  -- Kids can't get their own profile. I tried setting the game to use 'multiple profiles' but the feature is nigh-useless. I attempted to create a profile for my eldest so he can have his own rankings or even just his own car model when playing split-screen. I didn't want him to access online so I created a local profile. Now none of the games launch. They say 'You must connect online to launch the game.' I did say LOCAL account didn't I? Again, stupid. So I tried to create a new profile using my already created online account (cause I couldn't get the games to run even by myself before doing this.) The game wouldn't let me do that. Only one key per account it says. I tried creating a new account to the same effect. They want you to buy the game again just so you can use multiple profiles. So to recap, you can't create a local profile without connecting it to an onlne account and you can't create multiple users under one account and you can't create multiple online accounts without buying additional licenses. Stupid.  -- Due to the above, the simple feature in almost any racing game, choosing a car skin, can't be done except by the online profile. So my kids playing in split screen have to settle for the plain gray cars and my eldest can't keep his own records and scores.  -- Car engine sounds disappear when you select High quality Audio (you have to keep it at normal).  -- Some of the tracks are way too difficult for really little ones (not a knock on the game, just something to be aware of.)  -- Controls are not consistent between solo play and multiplayer. For example, the respawn button by default is the yellow Y button in solo play. In split screen, you push down (click the button) on the left analog stick. I'd like to remap it as the respawn button on the steering control leads to accidental respawns However, it doesn't seem to 'take' as it looks like it's tied to profiles, which as mentioned above, I can't create.  -- the in-game HUD is awful. Everything is so small it's pointless on a big screen from across the room. Thankfully the kids don't care about this info, they just want to race. Worth noting.    Conclusion    There is just too much stupidity in design to overcome for me. So if you find yourself with a media center that also serves as a game machine for the kids and are looking for a fun racing game the little ones can enjoy. I'd consider this title at rock-bottom prices otherwise I'm recommending you go elsewhere. You simply can't do simple things other racing games can, nothing is intuitive, the interface is awful (both menu and during racing). Despite that, once you get a race going, it is fun for the kids. So the core gameplay is ok, it's all the design elements, the spit and polish that surround the game that is severely lacking good design. If you want fun big-screen family room entertainment, local split screen multi-player, racing game - go get Sonic Transformed.  If you read this far and are just looking for a single-player or online, match-making, stunt racing, beat the clock game - why did you read my review? Didn't I write at the start this wasn't the perspective? Go check out other reviews that are more your demographic. Since you're still here, all the flaws mentioned above still irk me as a designer, so I'd look for a more realistic racing game than this one if it weren't for my kids and split screen wasn't a factor.  Get it on sale, avoid it otherwise.

Instead this game is about repeatedly racing very short segments until you get them perfect (or just manage to get to the end for the more challenging tracks). As soon as you make a mistake you can reset and restart instantly by just pressing a button. You can do that alone (against your ghost) or on a multiplayer server where you can see the others but there is no interaction with their cars.  If you're the type of obsessive gamer that loves retrying something hundreds and hundreds of times, then you may enjoy this. I wanted to do some fun races, that's not it. 
2980	0	a	You want technicall driving? Get a race sim.  You want crazy stunts and awesome tracks out of the workshop? Get Distance!  This game is just not worth your money when there are much better racing games out there.   Overall, I would say this game is actually pretty solid. Good physics, decent controlls, nice track editor. But it's multiplayer is quirky and the sheer focus on perfect technical driving is tedious and requires more effort than its worth. It's fun, yes, but it could be  more  fun.   Which is why I recommend you look elsewhere for fun racing games. Trackmania was cool when it was one of a kind. Now, it's been made obsolete by newer and better racing games.
2981	0	a	I played the first TMNations Forever Stadium and I suppose this is kind of better with graphics and so on, but honestly I enjoyed the first one more considering the community was a whole then. Now the community is just split and no one's playing TM2... Also they didn't need a second game for these small updates. I am not very pleased with this game especially not considering it actually costs money now. You HAVE TO buy it. Nadeo did fine on their own makin the first one. I stopped playing because of this game.   I recommended the first game because the community was awesome, but gotta put 'No' now in the recommend-box.
2982	0	a	Opponents are WAY too hard for their level and the track editor is brokem. Me coming from the old trackmania games, they were easier and the editor works! Avoid this and other trackmania2 games. Save up to get Trackmania United Forever and save money not buying seprate game. If you want stadium, then get Trackmania United Nations, witch is free.
2983	0	a	This game WAS good. I did used to enjoy it. Now because i have a new computer but same account it doesn't let me even make a new account because the product key is already used. Even playing off line it says 'Not Playable'. I think a refund is required. Absolutely annoyed.
2984	0	a	Easy track challenges are mild fun, while harder ones have artificial difficulty relying on good short term memory for blind corners, and requiring perfection from blunt inputs. My game stutters, making things more frustrating when going for gold medals, and multiplayer is outright confusing. You might enjoy it, but I didn't.

2988	0	a	This game really should be the best racing game in the genre ! The graphics are fantastic extreemly sharp and smooth flowing. The tracks are fun and can be challenging, their is also a track builder if you intrested in that sort of thing. So whats the issue..... If you want to race with other players online completing x amount of laps and see who comes first you cant. No such mode.
2989	0	a	Even though the game is fun, Maniaplanet is not very good. Also, asking $10 for a game what is almost the same as a free game (Trackmania Nations Forever)? It's good they don't ask $20, like for Valley. And then people moaning about the price of Valley because 'it is as good as TM² Stadium'? It is because Valley is more original. Stadium is just a consumer rip-off.
2990	0	a	Bought for cheap against my better judgement having owned a previous game. There's nothing wrong with the game. the way it plays, the graphics etc are very good.  what kills the fun is the servers filled with awful tracks. quite why so many people build tracks where if you don't judge it just right you fall off the road or don't make a jump you loose and have to go back to the start I don't know. Tracks where its really difficult to even work out where you should be going as the roads cross all over the place.  don't get me wrong i've some some really fun times on this and older versions on good racing tracks. make a mistake, just slows your time down. you don't just fly off into the distance and have to start the damn thing again.  such a shame because when its good its *really* good fun

3004	0	a	An accurate description of my experience with this game so far:  Bought it because i've been looking for a good racing game, and the original was always rather fun to play. upon loading it up, you don't actually load up TrackMania2, You load up one of those absolutely pointless multiverse systems. You are then poked and proded to log 50 times before you can get to anything that even says TM2 Stadium. Being that I don't quite care much for social aspects of racing games (infact, i have no interest in them other than to drone offline usually) I of course told it to go away and said log in offline.   Seems simple enough ok, maybe i can get to play the game; TrackMania2 Stadium -&gt; enter -&gt; 'Title not available' ...iight, cool sounds good. So, went to go for good measure try to make an account; Lol no thanks after about the 4th screen, Especially concidering the networking of the game seems to run on peer to peer which is heavily throttled by my isp. So I gave up, and went to look on the forums (always an exciting experience, as i'm sure many know.) Found nothing regarding offline play for the most part, other than some posts in russian that weren't really relevant.   Are my issues with this game easy to get around? Possibly, Though I don't quite care to jump through hoops for 2 hours though for something supposed to be relaxing. I'll probably end up getting it fixed someday but, For the purpose of relating ease of access to certain things^^^  Is this game a game for people who like an easy offline racing experience? No, wouldn't say so. If you're down with all the multiverse fluff then it could be the game for you but; I'm sure there are plenty out there for who it is not their idea of fun.

3011	0	a	I cant connect to the master server. From what Ive read, once you connect once, offline modes/single player are availible. I cant connect at all so the only things I can do in this game are change my graphics settings and edit my profile. I'll only recommend when I'm able to try out the game.
3012	0	a	Trackmania Nations Forever was fantastic game. TrackMania² Stadium is not. Why? Multiplayer servers for Laps games, my favorite game mode, are empty almost all the time and in the singleplayer someone with big brain made a change to count your time only once in every five minutes. This resulted in 4 minutes boredom and 1 minute full of stress. When you played Nations Forever you could make mistakes and it was still very fun, because you could try again at once. But now, you'll make one mistake and you must wait 5 minutes to try again. Nations Forever was fun, fun, fun. TM2 Stadium is waiting, waiting, stress, waiting, waiting... Hence I am not recomending this game, because with one simple change they made very fun game to be extremely annoying to play.
3013	0	a	Maniaplanet really runied this game, over complecated it and being added onto steam also caused a mix of tracks for download on workshop and tracks on TMX. I have so many problems with Maniaplanet, the layout is horrible, the 'game selection' system on the menu is pointless and the friends system is broken (or just to damn complex and stupid, says people are offline when they're online etc..)   Basically, Maniaplanet (and probably Ubisoft) runied the amazingly simple and great base game.  Remove maniaplanet and 10/10.

3016	0	a	I was playing Trackmania United Forever for about 2-3 years. Single player maps there had some sense,you were able to learn to drive from them and were builded from blocks that actually fit.   Those maps in Trackmania² which are marked as red and black are NOT more difficult to play. They are NOT designed to make you learn how to drive. They are designed to test you how far you can go till you ragequit. The creator of these maps probably ran out of ideas so he started to build them from some random blocks, adding crappy must-go-slow turns, hell even disabling 1st person camera on wallrides. The only good thing that happened to this game was adding the cyan edge lines on the blocks.
3017	0	a	have never played any of the other track mania games so i was not sure what to expect this will mostly be personal prefernce on this on i think seeing as how popular the series is.  start with the good nice graphics, level of detail is good cars get dirty ,rotating axel shafts are visible cool to see fun for a bit .  the bad have to sign up for an on line community to play (i hate signing up for stuff especailly when you just wanna play) game is pretty much an arcade time trial raceing against ghosts, even in online. not what i was expecting there was other modes for online it did appear but i could never find a server for them. says there is a big campaing mode but its not really like a campagin from any thing like i am used to eg, dirt, grid, forza basicily just more time trials and a couple of lap type races throwen in nothing really in the car customizaition. lots of track editing options not really into to that though, some of the custom track on line can be pretty bad. so ya i can't recomend, basicly just a non contact time trial arcade if thats your style get on sale,
3018	0	a	my first match was so bad i had to ask for a refund. and the game was only 2.49!!!

3021	0	a	Why are you want to play a racing game that is actually a kind of 'I want to be a guy'? Lots of stupid tracks that requires you to try about thousand million times to get to a single checkpoint (sometimes it's only for a half way to the cp), and sometimes if you're respawned in a cp you can't just finish the track because the checkpoint is placed so you never be able to get enough speed to get over a single obstacle. This is that sucks. ♥♥♥♥ off.

3031	0	a	Because I don't want another second wasted on this game, I copy pasted my friend his review, and totally agree with it;  I spent half an hour just trying to figure out the horrendous user interface of this game. I am being completely serious when I say this is probably the worst UI I have ever seen in a game, period. It is completely impossible to figure anything out. For some reason the main menu is a browser. For some reason browsing costs in-game currency. For some reason you can send mail, which also costs in-game currency. The server browser is a joke, the controls are an even bigger joke (♥♥♥♥ing arrow keys, are you kidding me?!)  Whoever was in charge of designing this piece of crap UI, please find a different line of work that doesn't involve designing anything ever again. Your handywork made me refund this game out of pure frustration within 30 minutes. Congratulations.
3032	0	a	If you've never played a Trackmania game before, this is a great game, and the other reviews will tell you why.  If you've played Trackmania United or Trackmania Nations, do NOT get this game. It's precisely the same as Trackmania United's stadium component with slightly better graphics and a smattering of new blocks. Trackmania 2 my ♥♥♥♥.

3040	0	a	This is a decent racing game, but the interface and game design just make it so frustrating to play.  Pros:  - Fun physics  - Racing against ghosts is a great way to learn the maps  Cons:  - UI barely works with a controller  - Unable to map all buttons on an Xbox controller  - Only get once chance to set best time for a map  - Requires secondary login to 'planetmania', if you forget this your game is gone. No way to recover account with just email address.  I bought this game for $2.50 and I feel like I paid too much. I would advise you stay away from this one.  Jager
3041	0	a	One of the worst 'racing' games I have ever played. People will tell you it's about going fast and doing stunts but it's not. Most of your time will be spent trying to figure out just what the level designer was thinking if you play online. Most of the tracks are cobbled together messes that have no real flow to them, meaning you'll be doing fine one second then flinging over a guardrail because you didn't turn at juuuust the right fraction of an inch to make the next turn causing you to start over. After a few hours of spamming the delete(reset) key, it became evident that racing new tracks was more of a chore than fun. Stick to the free to play version, this is not worth money.
3042	0	a	Game is good but most online tracks appear to be made by gibbons and are so poorly made you can end up flipping your car on a badly laid straight road. Im sure their are some good tracks but hey, im not eating my way through a tonne of ♥♥♥♥ to find maybe 1 twinkie. Maybe

3044	0	a	Because of the fact that this game is so much alike Trackmania Nations Forever I am going to compare them. This game, just like Nations, has only one envirement stadium. Game types are almost the same, there are alot less players in this game than in Nations. This game has better graphics and social side (friends and private messaging) of this game (as one of ManiaPlanet games) is alot easier to use. You can be on server and just decide to join your friend or just see how many players are on server where he/she is without leaving server and returning to main (home) page of the game.  Well, I guess you wonder why I spend all this time to write this little and negative about game. Its kinda addictive and right now I have more friends playing this game than Trackmania Nations (or United) Forever.  Its up to you to decide is it worth money or are you just gonna play demo.
3045	0	a	Official servers = good tracks except there is desync issue with cars.  Community servers are filled with garbage tracks (90% easily). There is no difference betweeen easy and hard, all have garbage design because you always have to drive perfect. One mistake and you are stuck because you don't have enough track to accelerate so you can't do anything. And how to learn track when mistakes are not allowed?  Proof - go on custom servers and see how many drivers can't even cross finish line and many of those who finish have way of times of several top drivers.  Play demo as it allows you to play on official servers.  It's pathetic that simulations like RACE series are easier to drive than this pure arcade.  And, there is Ubisoft which split community into 3 different titles.  DON'T BUY.
3046	0	a	I cannot recommend getting this at full price if you already have the original Trackmania, even if you only have the free version. There is little new content to be found - all assets seem to be re-used from the original game, except a few extra shaders have been slapped on.  Controller support is as half-♥♥♥♥♥ as ever. Navigating menus is a pain on a controller - at some points it will favour whatever your cursor is hovering over even if you're only using a controller to play, and at times it's hard to determine what is actually selected once you navigate to a new menu. Which brings me to another point: the game's UX/UI does not have a single bit of improvement over the original game.  And to top it all off, the alternative environments (Canyon, Valley) are separate titles which need to be paid for and launched individually. Get your ♥♥♥♥ together, guys. You're using Steam as a publisher, so why even bother making an in-game portal for switching between a bunch of games I don't even own?    I only paid £2 for this so I'm not too bothered, but since I've seen all it has to offer I have no reason to recommend it to anyone.
3047	0	a	Not a very good racing game, gets boring after a while.

3050	0	a	If ever I wasted money on a horible racing game this would be the one. I was really hoping for a unique fun racing experience and instead I get a game with no replay value at all. Race a bunch of people to beat a track time. I really wanted something a little more fun. The physics are the biggest joke of all. If you prefer actual race simulator games stay far away from this one. I wish I would have been warned before I bought it.
3051	0	a	everything went straight to hell the moment Ubisoft got in. (im talking about the community not the gameplay or content)  
3052	0	a	Thats the worst game i have ever played dont buy that ♥♥♥♥ if u are agressive u will ♥♥♥♥ ur pc....
3053	0	a	Yeah... I thought this game would be a good Game to get... But you just spend you're time Restarting the Race because you fall 1 second behind.... This is not a Game I would recommend playing unless you are ok with a Crappy Physics Engine and Pin Point Acurate Racing to the point where if you just hit the wall once... You have to restart. Which leads me to another Problem... There is no proper restart button... So you have to waste more time restarting the Damn Race then you spend in the race itself... All and all I'd give this game a 2/10 Rating
3054	0	a	An update. That's what you paid $10 for. That's not a bad thing - the sence of speed got taken to 11, and the visuals look amazing, but there are a couple nit-pickey things that make the older Nations Forever the better choice.  For some reason, it never remebers what skin I choose for my car. Every time I start up the game again, it swaps back to the unasigned gray car if I forget to change it. Another thing that suffers is that offline mode does not seem to work, which sucks, because I really like playing 8-player hotseat games against myself as another means to get good at a track.  I don't know. I'm going to have to thumbs down and reccomend the older Nations Forever unless you want the slick-neon sheen that 2 brings to the table.
3055	0	a	Complete and utter garbage. There is no other way to describe this game. First of all, you have to sign up for a 'Mania' account before you can play. Nowhere in the description or once you launch the game itself is that ever clearly explained. Then, once I finally created the freaking account and started up (and navigated around a menu system out of UX designer's nightmare) I found out that for some reason the game does not work with an XBox 360 controller. Digging around online I found that the makers of the game have been aware of the controller mapping problem for FIVE YEARS and have never bothered to fit it. I was really looking forward to building my own tracks and racing around, but in the end TrackMania was a massive, colossal dissapointment and frankly I will never, ever give any Mania Planet games even a second's consideration.
3056	0	a	*They removed everything that was great with the UI from the previous game *They changed sounds to ??? FUBAR ugly ones that sound out of place and flat *Forced blur with no option or config file to disable it *No podium at the end, just a splashscreen with results meaning there is no point with custom models. *Extreme shine on things to make it seem like actual new graphics.  In other words, they completely and utterly Ruined this game, added some new tools and functionalities to make map-making easier and more diverse. And the result is a stinking turd any trackmania or racing lover should stay away from. Trackmania United is much better than this 'new' game.
3057	0	a	Top Gear Magazine's #1 Greatest Game of the Motorsports Generation? I disagree. This game forgets a lot about what makes racing great, and that's turning hard left for several hours and having all of your blood pool to the left side of your body. Pure ecstasy. MAYBE, it really is the greatest game of the motorsports generation, but you know what? That's just because we unfortunately no longer live in the Nascar generation. The young European crowd has flooded the scene with their dopey F1 cars(adult sized go-karts) and their Tokyo Drifters...  Any serious fan of cars should boycot games like this, it makes a mockery of true 'motorsports' like Nascar, circular rally racing and slot car racing by focusing on stupid stuff like formula racing. Uh, hello? Formula is for babies!  Because I'm a generous Nascar fan(seriously we Nascar enthusiasts are the friendliest bunch on earth) I will give this game 4 screaming V8 engines out of 9. Do not test me again Nadeo, your next game better be an all American classic.
3058	0	a	The servers for this game are terrible and always fail to load. Do not buy
3059	0	a	No shooting.
3060	0	a	Game was boring
3061	0	a	sucked - don't buy   30 second races, kiddie controls (stop,go, left right)  get sonic transformed - way better
3062	0	a	This game is not fun
3063	0	a	I planned to buy the game and share with my brother to play. Unfortunately it cannot fully access to another online account(my brother's) when I opened family sharing, went into demo mode. Only my own account is fully accessed.
3064	0	a	This is a fantastic game that also happens to be fantastically optimised. However, I bought it god knows how long ago and hadn't played it since then. While loading it up today, it says my code for the game is already in use and as such my copy is invalid. ♥♥♥♥ DRM and ♥♥♥♥ any company that still uses proprietary launchers for games (Looking at you, Ubisoft and EA)
3065	0	a	I Would have loved this game if i could play with friend but always says could not contact server...

3067	0	a	check points are bull .... if you fail and restart you might as well close the game down and re open it up seaming you are never going to make it and they should bring in a reset where it takes you back to the beging off the track not the last check point so you can play the game
3068	0	a	its just a pain in the ♥♥♥ to get going and the track editor is a pain to use i do not recomend this game iunless you have A) constant(good)internet connection. B)patience and C) a decent pc to play it on. just dont get it i herd tmTURBO came out and i definetly wanna try that but i do not recomend stadium if you meet the cryteria i explained above.
3069	0	a	I spent half an hour just trying to figure out the horrendous user interface of this game. I am being completely serious when I say this is probably the worst UI I have ever seen in a game, period. It is completely impossible to figure anything out. For some reason the main menu is a browser. For some reason browsing costs in-game currency. For some reason you can send mail, which also costs in-game currency. The server browser is a joke, the controls are an even bigger joke (♥♥♥♥ing arrow keys, are you kidding me?!)  Whoever was in charge of designing this piece of crap UI, please find a different line of work that doesn't involve designing anything ever again. Your handywork made me refund this game out of pure frustration within 30 minutes. Congratulations.
3070	0	a	I’ve played a lot of Project Cars, but I’ve had enough and I doubt I’ll go back to it. It’s a nice looking game, at 4K resolution and with the video settings maxed out runs very smoothly on my system. There is a wide selection of cars (if you buy the DLC) and plenty of tracks, but that all counts for nothing when so many other areas of this game are sorely lacking.   The opponent AI in Project Cars is absolutely dreadful; It appears to be almost pathologically incapable of not colliding with you. It has this apex or nothing mentality, which means if you actually try to race with it through a corner there is almost bound to be a collision. By way of comparison I’ve been playing Assetto Corsa again recently and the AI - while not perfect - is so much better, you can actually race closely with it through corners without the constant likelihood of being rammed off the track.   At any track with a tight first corner (Oschersleben, Nurburgring Sprint and GP for example) there is almost always a huge pile-up there on the first lap, where the race will sometimes grind to halt altogether, I think this is caused by the aforementioned apex fixation. I’ve also seen AI cars actually collide with the end of the pit-wall on the way out of the pit-lane and spin, although this appears to have been patched by simply making the AI cars able to ghost through anything (including your car) when they exit the pits. So much for realism.   The AI also cheats constantly. It’s able to cut corners and chicanes and go outside of the track limits with impunity. Being able to set qualifying laps and gain race positions by doing things that you would be penalised for. I've seen some pathetic excuses on the Project Cars forum that the AI is just 'making mistakes', yeah right. Also in practice and most qualifying sessions you have to warm up your tyres on your out-lap, but the AI is just able to go at full racing speed straight out of the pits. Similarly, the AI is also able to traverse gravel traps and grass without losing any speed, where your car would quickly grind to a halt.    After the first two or three seasons the career mode becomes really dull. Apart from the one or two race series you unlock by completing career objectives, you have the same championships you had before at the same tracks in the same order with the same weather. There’s this cringe worthy “Fan Chat feature in career mode which is basically a feed of repetitive comments with your driver’s name copied and pasted into them with a wince inducing hashtag at the end. Whenever a racing game tries to incorporate a faux “social media element (GRID 2 for example), it just looks a bit sad and desperate and this is no exception.    Flag rules are also poorly implemented, blue flags in particular are a joke. On a qualifying lap at Barcelona I pass a car as it’s coming out of the pits on the main straight, then on the way into the first corner I’m shown a blue flag because that same car is behind me albeit some distance away. Just laughable, which pretty much sums this game up, a game I've uninstalled and consigned to the backwaters of my steam library.
3071	0	a	I had a very popular positive review up for this game until now. Over the past year my opinion has changed.  I play with a racing wheel and play a lot of racing games and sims (all Codemasters games, iRacing, rFactor 2, RaceRoom,...).  I'll keep it short:   The good
3072	0	a	It's hard to quantify what's wrong with this game in exact, concise words. Yes, on paper, everything this game includes, especially in GOTY form, sounds like an absolutely excellent package, but it's a 'jack of all trades, master of none' situation, and even then, it's only decent at those trades at best.  Positives first. It is very visually striking, and that absurd insistence that so many racing games have nowadays of making the cars impossibly, constantly shiny is absent in actual gameplay. The track list is impressive, and the original / un-licensed courses are excitingly original or amusingly just ever-so-slightly off. The Azure Coast and California Highway point-to-point races are extremely gorgeous, with the latter's bridge giving me vibes of Daytona USA. Azure Circuit and Sakitto fill in for Monaco and Suzuka, and I'm still loving that the Japanese circuit is literally just named Circuit but with a Japanese accent. All the courses included just feel right (except for Laguna Seca somehow), and it's a pretty excellent globetrotting collection.  The car list, at least with DLC, is a bit scattered, but you'll generally find something exciting to enjoy even if you don't recognize the name right away. I found the Superkarts to be a welcome surprise that I heavily underestimated at first, the LMP vehicles impressively powerful and forcing me to change my racing line as I considered the automatic KERS usage, and the Caper Monterrey fit my need for classic American stock cars quite well (at least partially).  The career mode is a simple calendar-and-event format akin to Dirt to Daytona, and it works pretty well aside from the blatantly bugged/repetitive emails and fan praise you receive. My number one praise for it is something that racing games in general need to learn how to do: DLC courses and cars actually are included, with their own events unlocked on the calendar as you progress if you have them. They aren't just awkwardly shunted to a free play portion of the game. They're part of the core experience. That's a massive plus.  However, after a while, the career mode just isn't enjoyable. That's not so much a fault of repetitive events, or my unnecessary compulsion to play every single event in order when I could just come back to them later. The problem is the AI.  The AI is a  massive  failure.  So, racing in go-karts, yeah, I can see a little bit of bumping and slamming. It's go-karts! I'm being aggressive, too. Stock cars, yeah, they'll charge a bit hard in the turn, so of course the drivers would be thrown off. GT endurance racers smashing each other off the track? Well, that's a little silly!  Starting an F1 (renamed Formula A in-game) race and immediately getting plowed into by the driver behind me, who digs into my wheelwell and chucks me into a ditch before the entire rest of the field dogpiles them and brings the race to an immediate screeching halt with the screams of tires and smashing of car bodies, showering the track in debris and caking the road in crushed cars? Bad. Very bad. It ended up very, very consistently like this regardless of difficulty adjustment. It cannot (noticably) tell the difference between different vehicles in terms of racing lines and aggression.  Now, you might just be thinking, 'well, maybe you just suck at this'. Fair enough. I don't play sims often. I got stuck in rFactor immediately because I didn't think to shift the car into neutral to leave the pit lane. But I'm getting better at that. This? This is not a sim. It's not a simcade racer, either, not entirely. It's trying to be both, and again, it's aggressively mediocre in many regards because of that. It very much enjoys spinning the player and AI alike out, and recovery is nigh-impossible. A massive array of tuning options and an insistence on actual reasonable racing lines bodes well for it being a fine sim, but the actual physics and AI behavior just don't line up with that, reverting to cartoony slides and demolition derbies in short order.  And full disclosure? I'm particularly furious that this game was  supposed  to have an oval racing mode, hence the stock cars even being included, but they gave up on it, allegedly after issues with the AI being incapable of navigating the ovals in a satisfactory manner. The AI is incapable of navigating  anything , though. As such, the US Car Pack stands out as a purposeless shell, including IndyCar and NASCAR vehicles for tracks that never came to fruition, and that's after they already licensed, mapped, and rendered Indianapolis Motor Speedway! They just threw it out and said they'd try again in the sequel.  In any case, yes, there are brief moments of fun here, and simply ogling the cars is probably money's worth in itself. I don't entirely regret my purchase. But it's such a weak roster for each discipline it represents that this is simply a stopgap appetizer before you go and buy whatever game includes the disciplines you like most. It tries to be everything and, as such, stretches itself extremely thin, extremely quickly. It's a wide array of shallow kiddy pools rather than one immersive but limited dunk tank.  But hey, it's pretty, right?
3073	0	a	Beautiful, polished, great driving physics and a dynamic envrionment make this racing game very appealing at first glance. However after spending some time with this game I have been dissapointed with the immersion this game offers as there are many features missing that a racing simulator should have.   1. There is no flag system or safety car. This gripe may seem nit picky but it does take away from the simulator feel of a race day when there are no flags to warn drivers that there may be a hazard ahead. Flags and safety cars are a huge feature in modern racing, often changing the outcome of a race and entire strategies devoted to pitting around safety car deployment. This leads into the second gripe, there are no AI caused accidents for there to be a safety car or flag system in the first place.   2. AI too flawless. The AI has no character in this game, they drive around almost on rails only to deviate in the most extreme cases occasionally onto the grass but then make a full recovery and lose 1 second on their lap time due to a small mistake. They are aware of the player, but too often they will completely give way to the player as if repelled by magnets. The biggest problem with the dull AI is that there are no retirements no matter how long the race is. 100 Lap races will 100% of the time have a full field finish, no mechanical faults, no accidents, no spins, even with full damage turned on. The AI does not make a mistake that leads to any game changing events. This makes for a very dull, boring race experience.   3. The career mode only offers a single full season of driving (17 races in a season) in one mode, the F1 equivalent Formula A mode. If you want to drive touring cars or karts or any other league the season is made up of only 5 or so races. It is kind of like the progress of simcade racing games like GT and Forza, just without the upgrades and car modifying and street circuits.   4. Every car is as solid as a tank. The damage modelling in this game reminds me of an old Need for Speed where you were able to drive at 300kmh and crash into any solid object and just bounce off. Damage is a huge component of racing, often slight damage will lead to changing a racing strategy and adds a huge element of risk/reward to a race. Damage is what keeps a race on the edge, gives a race character. Drivers will avoid taking huge risks because damage is a deterrent, and damage affects performance. Not in this game though, damage for the most part does nothing. You can use other cars as a brake with little consequence. Crash into a wall head on at 200kmh, and you will suffer slight suspension problems and get a couple of cosmetic scratches and a bent hood. That kind of a crash in reality would end with a DNF and debris everywhere. Since there is no deterrent to crashing in this game, the only solid tactic for racing is an aggressive push all the other cars off the road style.   The surface of the game is really spectacular, it will easily draw you in and look amazing, but don't be fooled. This is not what I would expect from a racing simulation, it sits halfway between a Forza/Gran Tourismo and a racing sim, but does neither very well. It is not an arcade game where you can customise your cars and earn a sense of progression with unlocking newer nicer vehicles and new modifications. It is not a simulator where you can immerse yourself into the reality of a race day. Project Cars lacks any character or vision for what it is, and in attempting to appeal to a very broad audience it has alienated the fans of both arcade and simulator fans alike by providing neither.   If you just want a game where you have the opportunity to drive around very pretty circuits with traffic and time trials then this game might be sufficient. It feels great looks great and sounds great. But it really lacks in the gameplay department so if you want a game that simulates racing, then I recommend you look elsewhere.  
3074	0	a	I've put a lot of time into Project CARS, and frankly, I'm fed up. So I'm going to give a long and thorough review of it.  TL/DR Version: Broken promises, missing game features, and crippling bugs should keep you away. Ultimately, this entire things feels like a giant paid BETA for Project Cars 2. I.E. You are paying full retail for the privilege of beta testing for the sequal.    Pro's:
3075	0	a	update 2016: This is a glimpse of the game you are about to buy (i hope not)  www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPWogDgRnfI  You can find many more on youtube.  And this image below is the remarkable post by Ian Bell, head studio of Slighty Mad Studios (that he erased it because he was getting too much love for it):    http://i.imgur.com/J7wCj0X.png    update as of december 2015:
3076	0	a	Right now I can't recommend this game.   General
3077	0	a	I like the core game and enjoy it however, while the main selling point of this game is the graphics they are so poorly optomized for AMD rigs that I do not feel I can recommend this game to anyone running AMD hardware. I feel the after paying $50 for the game discovering it is so poorly made is a disapointment. If this game is 75% off or they fix the poor optomization then I would recomend buying it. Update: After having tried the game on windows 10 it works much better so if you have windows 10 then ignore the stuff about poor optimization.
3078	0	a	Have to say I'm pretty disappointed in this game, as it currently stands. I do not feel that it lives up to the hype.  First off, the graphics are hardly as great as all the review sites claim. In some ways, they are impressive. The lighting is the standout, once you get past the cliche stuff like post-processed lens flare. The car models are impressive too. Textures and landscape are passable. But, what kills the look of this game for me are two things: First, the terrible, terrible shadows. These look like what you'd expect from the 16-bit era. They are rendered in what looks like horribly low resolution and flicker like crazy. almost pixelating the track wherever they are cast. Even on 'ultra' setting. Just terrible. And SMAA antiliasing seems to make the shadows worse. Speaking of which -- then there's the aliasing. Sure, the game offers a whole bunch of anti-aliasing options. But none of them work very well. Even with MSAA 4x and SMAA at 'ultra', there are brutal jaggies everywhere. The only way I could reign this in was by cranking Nvidia DSR with smoothness filter at 50% and FXAA at 'high'. That would normally result in a blurry mess in most games, but this game is so over sharpened and aliased out of the box that you need to do this to get anything like a decent look. Overall, I don't get the big fuss over this game in the graphical department. It looks decent but nothing special in my opinion. I've run it maxed out in 1440p and on triple 1080p screens, downsampled from 4k, you name it... nothing has impressed me very much.   (By contrast: another recent racing game, Dirt Rally, currently in early access, looks to my eye WAY, WAY, better. That game has excellent anti-aliasing, excellent shadows and ambient occlusion, and at least as nice textures and models. No comparison, in my view.)  Speaking of triple screens, the game currently has no independent rendering, so you have to set a high FOV and keep your monitors in a straight line. That alone should be a strong signal this is not a very serious racing game, despite whatever the marketing fluf would claim.  Then there's the racing. The dealbreaker for me here is that the AI in this game is infuriating. If you play at the easier difficulty levels, it's a cakewalk to leave them in the dust. But as soon as you crank up the difficulty, not only do they get faster (which is good) but they get excessively aggressive -- so the game becomes a demolition derby. Earlier today I tried TWENTY TIMES to get through the first corner in an open wheeled race. I ended up rage quitting. The AI cars ram into you and each other like suicidal morons, so you can't get started without getting rammed and spun out, very likely suffering 'suspension damage' that renders your car undrivable. I tried a bunch of different race setups and the result is nearly always the same. Set the difficulty at 80% or higher, and most of the AI cars will be missing bodywork 10 seconds into the race, and the only way to avoid their mayhem is to hang back behind them all. This is so stupidly unrealistic and game-breaking, it'd be hilarious if I hadn't dropped a good chunk of cash on this.  So, overall, we have decent but way overhyped graphics and racing crippled by terrible AI. My recommendation is to pass over this game, at least for now. I bought into the hype train on this one, don't make the same mistake.  EDIT AS OF PATCH 2.0:   This latest patch seems to have achieved some improvement to AI aggression. I no longer experience as consistently infuriating a melee off the line and into the first corner with high difficulty levels. However, that isn't to say the AI cars won't still ram you from behind, sideswipe you while cornering, etc. They still seem to drive like they're blind, drunk and senile pretty frequently. And it's frustrating when this happens halfway through the race, when some AI driver comes out of the pits and decides to ram you. This may actually be even more annoying than the demolition derby off the starting line.   Also, the main AI avoidance mechanism now seems to be driving off into the grass and the gravel traps. Which is a bit comical because they seem to magically drive at full speed over these surfaces and rejoin the asphalt at race pace. I often look in my rearview and see AI cars driving at full clip all over the grass as they struggle to avoid each other. By contrast, you will slow to a crawl and struggle to control your car if you hit the gravel. I've also noticed the AI drivers cutting corners, while you will get a 'warning from the race director' if you do so. These warnings, by the way, seem overly sensitive with this new patch. This adds to the frustration when an AI car sideswipes you, forcing you to put a wheel on the grass, and the game announces you've 'cut the corner' and will be penalized.  I've also experienced some frustrating new bugs and crashes. A standout was when I had run a great qualifying lap and wanted to skip to the beginning of the race. I was treated instead to an infinite loading screen. I had to end task, lose my time, and start again. Checking the forums I saw numerous others are having the same problem.  I still have mixed feelings about the graphics. I guess if you have a high tolerance for aliasing and other temporal artifacts (I've noticed lately that the game also seems to have texture fighting issues, with distant objects flashing), and enjoy post-processed lighting effects, this will impress. But that is not my preference, and it is still my opinion that this game's graphics are overhyped.   Overall, there is some improvement evident with Patch 2.0, but not enough to edge this out of the thumbs-down zone for me. The frustration is still overwhelming the fun. The game still feels far from a polished product. Maybe someday this will be a great game, but it isn't yet.
3079	0	a	Don't buy this game if you're and AMD owner and PLEASE consider not buying this game at all because of the anti consumer practices involved in building this game around Nvidia Physx that CANNOT run well on AMD cards. This kind of ♥♥♥♥ needs to be stopped.
3080	0	a	Update: The game is now playable with gamepad. Quite a few people were interested in this aspect so will put this update up top.  The rest of the game has improved but is still a mixed bag. To be blunt the early access DiRT Rally is a more consistent and polished product than the current version of pCARS.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Well here we are finally project cars is erm finished? Complete? Er let’s just say its ‘released’! Considering where the build was years ago I had hoped, dreamed, and even reasonably expected more. Somehow I think by trying to do absolutely everything pCARS has it all but none of it is really 100% sadly.  Don’t get me wrong pCARS is great. If I could, this review wouldn’t be a thumbs up or down but a wavering in-between. There just really needs to be a critique of pCARS other than the overflowing WMD love fest currently on steam. Take with a grain of salt the reviews of those personally involved with the development of this game. We all stand to possibly gain financially from its success to boot. Although the details are very very murky. Perhaps my negative review will mean my financial reward is lost? We’ll see :) Would you trust the cast of a movie to honestly review a movie on release? Of course not… what about the crew? Well if they all have royalty options and are hardcore fans dedicated and have been working for free the past few years? Up to you. I see pCARS as the first racing sim to have a hardcore fan base with plenty of ‘fanboys’ preloaded before release!  If you have 20 minutes spare this video captures my point exactly:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eD7o_f7s0Y   PROS: -Variety Heaps of cars for all tastes! Open wheelers, road cars and everything else! Lots of tracks and configurations. What a variety of conditions. Want to run a 24 hour race around Bathurst with everything from thunderstorms to clear sky’s go for it! -Visuals Amazing screen shots. You’ve seen them! The car models are stunning. Great cockpits with all moving parts (via g-forces too) bells and whistles. -Large grids.  Depending on the track run 40 cars. (this has been unstable for me in the past) -Built by the community. Despite my problems with the rabid variety of fan boy any developer that listens and reacts is doing good in my book.  CONS: -Variety By giving you everything and the kitchen sink (thank god rallying was dropped!!) SMS have bitten off more than they could chew in my opinion. Few cars or tracks feel 100% polished at this stage. Pushing the limits of number of AI and conditions still results in occasional crashes for me. -Visuals They don’t live up to the screen shots! At the beginning of development my PC was woefully under spec. I could tour around in some builds hot lapping by myself waiting for the day I got a beast and it would look like the screen shots. I got my i7 with SSD and 16gig of ram gtx 970 and I can get over 100FPS with a full field in the rain but it doesn’t look at all like the screen shots out there. Some talented community members have worked magic with the photo mode and post processing on videos. -Starts in background. The game has never ever, on 2 different PC’s I’ve owned, started as the foreground window. It starts goes into the task bar and there I can click or alt-tab all I want, it stays until I kill the process… The only way I can play is from the quick launch right clicking steam. If it’s been a while since playing I have to start it then kill it and quick launch. This was raised and talked about forever on WMD, how on earth is it still not fixed? Don’t have any trouble with any other game at all! -Terrible gamepad support. Yes I can hear them now why use a gamepad it’s a SIM etc. Short answer I have too. My back is stuffed. I have all the gear I want it’s no good if I can’t use it. Anyway I have learnt to get around in other SIMS with my Xbox one PC controller. It’s not easy but I get around in iRacing, rFactor 2, Assetto Corsa, Race Room Racing Experience and many other sims with the gamepad. Race Room Racing Experience in my experience setting the bar for how a sim should support gamepad.  I really can’t understand it I used to enjoy NFS shift as an in-between serious racing game for some fun. It had terrible wheel support with massive dead zones and was only really playable with the gamepad. So now the same developers have gone and created a game that is completely unplayable with the gamepad but now works great with the wheel? Why why why? -AI The AI has improved a lot in the final build. But then it had too! In this final build the AI displays less of its psychotic death wish driving style, actually respecting the track boundaries and your car for the most. However it is not possible to run a race without finding corner tyres and witches hats strewn everywhere after the first few laps. Being on a qualifying lap then slamming into a corner tire thrown onto the racing line and losing your lap time because of contact brings the kind of joy known only previously by the gran turismo special mission races. Don’t touch anything or you fail. AI rams you… oh joy! Why do all modern sims have such poor over aggressive AI? rFactor 2 is the only modern sim that will give you anything like the sort of behaviour you would see at a professional race weekend as opposed to the open multiplayer full of kids experience todays AI seems to replicate! -Physics WMD members get excited by the SETA tire model. It dynamically simulates aspects of the tire model that other sims use static graphs and data to simulate. In theory tires should heat up, cool down, wear out, flex and a whole lot of subtle things more realistically. In practice I don’t think it’s finished yet. A tire model is a hell of a thing to develop. Clever people have been at it for decades building upon previous work done. Is this dynamic model a step toward the future. Yes. Does it right now give you the best, most consistently matching real life data model out there today. Nope. In a word the physics feel 'floaty'...   And this pretty much sums up pCARS right now. The potential is huge. Bigger than anything before. But there simply wasn’t enough time to finish every part of the game to the level it deserves. I would have gladly had less cars, less track, less dynamic models to have GT cars with the weather all at a 100% finished level polished like all hell, than a bit of everything that doesn’t quite feel right a lot of the time. I would say if your using a gamepad wait, if you’re not really into your racing sims wait. If you have a wheel and enjoy a wide variety of different racing sims that all have different pros and cons then no doubt this purchase is a no brainer! Just don’t expect the holy grail of sims that some claim it to be and you won’t be disappointed.  I’m hoping they finish this off it really could be brilliant. But having heard pCARS 2 already mentioned I’m not sure this sim will ever get the polish it needs.
3081	0	a	 http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=462761065   Pros:  - quantity of content - physics for most of the race cars - decent track modelling for being non-laserscanned  Cons:  - physics for most of the street cars - strange design decisions in regards to the AI aggressiveness and career skill - odd bugs - the WMD community  I've put enough hours into this to feel I've justified my purchase, but I leave the game feeling like I've accomplished little of what I had hoped to get out of it. Going into PCars, I was hoping for a light sim with drivable if not phenomenal physics and track modelling, tons of qualilty content, a solid career mode, and top-notch artificial intelligence.  The physics for most of the race cars actually managed to exceed my expectations. The Prototypes, GT Cars, and modern Open Wheelers in particular are generally fun to drive and behave more or less in the manner you would expect. Most of the street cars, on the other hand, would be unsellable if they handled as poorly as they do in this sim. There are also the odd gMotor-like physics issues with regards to how the cars interact with the track surface, as occasionally what should be minor undulations will actually cause tires to lose contact with the track entirely, as if the suspension isn't doing its job properly. Additionally, some cars have very little grip when the tires are outside of their optimal temperature range, where in reality you would expect slightly less grip but for the tires to otherwise maintain their usual slip characteristics.  The tracks are also surprisingly well modelled considering that, AFAIK, laser-scanning was not used to create them. Having driven many of these tracks in iRacing and Assetto Corsa, I was impressed with how close they are represented here. With that said, elevation and camber changes seem to have gotten the worst of it, but overall the tracks are functional and don't take me out of the experience.  The career mode is almost insultingly barebones. I am absolutely in love with the idea of basing it on a real motorsports career, where you can choose a starting level and work your way up and down the disciplines appropriately. What I'm not in love with is the hightly repetitive nature of the social media aspects, where the same handful of headlines, emails and fake twitter posts are repeated based on your performance in the most recent race.  What I'm also not in love with, in regards to the career, is how the AI difficulty is automatically scaled downwards based on which tier you are racing in. I understand that they're trying to simulate the level of talent increasing as you progress higher through your career, but the differences should be based on the density of talent rather than a change to the overall difficulty slider. This is something that I think Dirt Rally does well - the top times are always in the same ballpark, but the overall skill of the field tightens up as you move through your DR career. Whether you're racing in karts or the LMP series (which is, laughably, placed higher than F1 in the career tree), the top drivers should be similarly skilled. The difference should be that the LMP series would have more of those top drivers than the lower tiers.  Speaking of AI, the AI is super aggressive. I like that they attempt to defend and gain positions, but the 'red mist' that has apparently been implemented has got to go. It is routine to see cars, after being passed, immediately cut the next corner or run wide on the exit, even if doing so means driving directly into another car or a physical barrier. Addtionally, the lines they take at times are shockingly bad. Braking too late into corners and then getting on the throttle far too late, causing them to crawl down the ensuing straight. Cutting corners or exiting wide, again causing them to crawl down the ensuing straight. The AI in this game basically drives like first-time online racers, with no situational awareness and no understanding of the importance of early throttle application on corner exit.  I feel like, despite not recommending this title, there are quite a few positives to be had. However the poor career mode and AI really make the overall experience pointless, as there are far better sims out there for online play or hotlapping. As of this time I cannot recommend the title, but I do plan on revisiting it in the future when it has been patched further and more content has been released.
3082	0	a	Waste of money. Runs terribly on AMD cards. Dev intentionally optimized the game for Nvidia cards only, and never warned of this on the store page.
3083	0	a	I wanted to love pCars but the FFB is lazy, the physics are weird, the A.I are nutters, there's so many bugs and to top it off the studio head is a disrespectful tool that insults his customers if they have valid issues that they are reporting.
3084	0	a	If you own an AMD graphics card DO NOT buy this game. It is built for Nvidia cards and the devs have no intention of supporting AMD users. If you have an Nvidia card then go for it, it'll probably run well. I have a R9 280X and this game dips as low as 10 fps at times. People with R9 290 cards also can't run it well. Do not waste your hard earned money on this game or this developer.
3085	0	a	Let me see, lets address whether I will be censored with an opinion on this review? erm no, good  Lets get to it, the amount of poor support regarding this game is a joke, having major issues for people all over seems to be missed due to the amount of censoring done by Devs Known fact amongst STEAM users and also else where If this is how SMS wants to treat its customers, then by all means don't think the same user base will be buying pC2  Now to the game, lets just say I have played better on consoles fwiw Joypad support is non existant for user input here, sur eyou have a plethora of adjustments at hand, but why? none seem to give any smooth input making the game frustrating to say the least Well all can't just buy wheels, which it seems this game is designed for I have 4 myself, but no where to use this as I have a 55 inch TV I use for the PC, so no desk Having asked the forum reasons to why controller input has been over looked, a response of, 'we don't support 3rd party apps'  If this is the kind of support one is expected as a soruce of 'professionalism', well I am sure this transparency to the real intentions of the Devs is seen Quite simply, they don't care about our needs  I have pretty much played every car game out there, not all, but pretty much most of them, and this game by far even though it's eye candy plus, is lacking some serious support from SMS 1.5 million games sold? most on consoles, they use a Joypad as a predominant device, yet PC seems to be over looked, why?  The game has potential, which is met by the arrogance of the Devs and support staff, thinking thsi game is a Sim. It's far from, most things that go to make it a Sim is broke, too many issues  AI is seriously BIASED so it does as it pleases and is not confined to the rules of what you drive to Opponents go off track, over take you, you do the same, you get penalties and slow down, great  All I can say is, a good looking game does not necessarily make a good playing game  Edit, proof of how customers get treated   http://oi60.tinypic.com/20b1pv6.jpg   This post has since been removed  Update, looks like that pic has been removed so here it is again   http://postimg.org/image/stmxy7iih/   Edit 31/01/16  I am adding that my review has been hidden, for what ever reason, I don't know, but it just goes to show how the devs censor anything but a positive review  EDIT, I have to add this, this is a moderators msg to me to why I was banned, and since I have already spoken to a Global, it wasn't a STEAM mod, but SMS Leviathon who did this   http://s13.postimg.org/bydqbih87/p_CMr_Wii_JPG.jpg   Now since this is specifically a friend of mine I was speaking to, hence the sledging, I don't see how any of the reasons apply to why I was banned, particularly since I had already deleted the comment myself  This ISN'T about me being banned, this is about how SMS employees treat their customers, ergo my review  Unfortunate as it is, but I doubt many people 2nd time round will invest in pC2, given that we were promised a DX12 upgrade, looks like that's not coming either...
3086	0	a	Unfinished, even at patch 1.4. The amount of game breaking bugs, unfinished features, poor ai, crap multi player and even worse AI make this game nothing more than a graphical showcase. The developers have time to release paid DLC and work on features like advanced RAIN - fecking RAIN, rather than fix the broken game. STEER CLEAR if you want to enjoy racing - there are plenty to choose from on the PC.
3087	0	a	I have held competition licenses for many years now, and I can tell you that this is so far off from a sim that it is laughable. Most reviews of this game come from people playing a controller. In it's own right I understand that not everyone will have a high end racing wheel to use. However, any real sim should be tested and reviewed at minimum with a controller and a wheel.  First things first, I am not some crazy over the top fanboy. This game looks great. The interface is smooth, and has a very nice layout. The graphics put it in a league of its own. There are lots of little things that this game gets right that a lot of other racing games and sims alike seem to really muck up. This is one of the first games that I have played that did not immediately lock up the rear wheels when pulling the hand brake. On the subject of Brakes, this has a loose idea of something called Brake fade. The hotter the rotors get, the more distance the car will need to stop or slow down. The engine temp will rise and fall depending on ambient temperature, Driving style, clean air V.S. Drafting. It has a lot of small things done very well. It is one of the few where you can toggle the lights and see the effect on the environment. The different camera angles are spot on. There are true elements the devs wanted this game to be a sim.  I want to like Project CARS. I really do, but I can't. This is not a sim. It is a game. Had it been marketed more as a game I would have loved it. In fact in early development it was. It changed rather abruptly near launch however. It became the 'Ultimate Driver Journey' and 'For Racers by Racers.' None of the actual racers I know whether it is SCCA cone chasers or Rally America drivers had many things that we said put into this game. The end product actually turned out to be something some of us downright hated. The physics are buggy, sometimes you fall through the track, sometimes the car has more grip than it would on rails, other times it is like driving on ice. Collisions are far from sim level. You might be asking, ' Isn't the point of a sim not to crash?' Absolutely, however mistakes happen on the track. It is a reality of the sport that drivers have to accept every time tires touch the track. This game has nearly no consequences for mistakes large or small. Hit a rumble strip too hard, nothing will happen. Bump a player or AI. Mild scratches. Really hit them, body damage and mild alignment failure. It seems really upsetting that games or sims in this genre really seem to ignore player punishment. The odd thing of it all is that is what players want. We want the aggravated feeling of throwing away the whole race over a miscalculation leading us to rip an oil pan off and blow an engine; Or the feeling of unspeakable pride when we finally master a track.   I know that there are going to be bugs in a game like this. I am sure things like that lack of Force Feedback, or awkward dead-zones will eventually be fixed. There isn't a game out there that is trying to achieve this level of detail that wont have a few things to work out. I understand that, but there was so much potential that was just thrown away. It was like a sim that didn't know it wanted to be a sim. Driving feels disconnected and not very authentic.   Project CARS is a good game, but just that. If you are a hard core racing sim seeker I would go into this game with the idea that it is not a sim. It is a fun and somewhat challenging racing game, but it will not meet all of your needs as a hardcore driving sim fan. In total I will give Project CARS a 77/100. The beautiful graphics and amazing attention to detail make this game stand out, but I can not forgive the vague sense of driving or the important bits that Slightly Mad Studios Gave up on. With that I can not recommend this Sim as a sim. It gets an 'Eh maybe' as a game.
3088	0	a	Have an AMD card? Then you are ♥♥♥♥ed! The devs are in bed with nvidia, and have screwed over player with non-nvidia cards. SMS has downgraded AMD performance.  (Also, force feedback seems to be also sub-par, or do my memories trick me in that regard?)  Exhibit a: all tracks are awash with nvidia ads. Either SMS have an idiotic sense of finances and were duped into including nvidia ads in their game for free, or they are lying through their teeth. As their successful financing of the game hints at good sense of money, I'm sorry to say the latter one is the more sensible of the two options. (Or they are rabid nvidia fanboys who plaster everything with nvidia logos. Which would be even worse.)  Exhibit b: while a couple hundred builds back, AMD cards were working fine, now surprisingly they are simply not utilized. GPU usage is far from 100%, with the same driver as before. This is from October of 2014, build 829:  http://i.imgur.com/867VGbX.png  And this is from now, build 1000+:  http://i.imgur.com/Fcm4FSO.png  The difference is that the first lets you go mostly ultra on a 290X, while with the second, you can't even use high settings for the same framerates.
3089	0	a	As a simracer I've been waiting for this game for a long time. When I plugged in my T500RS and did my first laps I was like: Wow, Need for Speed Underground is back? The force feedback gives you zero feel for the cars. It feels like playing Ship 'Simulator'. Don't get me wrong, this game will make a good 3rd person console gamepad title but srsly... not a sim.  I'm Nürburgring Touristenfahrer and drive the ring about 4 laps a month. There are sims which simulate driving the ring pretty good on an accurate layout but not this one. Everything just feels totally wrong.  Sadly I can't review the graphics because I'm only using an AMD R9 card and we all now that this game runs good only on nvidia cards.  I had high hopes on this game because of all those Fanboys (that will dislike this review of course as you can see on every negative review here) around hyping it so much.  Long story short.. You want a 3rd person console gamepad racer? Buy it. You want a Simulator? Don't buy it. 
3090	0	a	UPDATE 5/6/2016 I find it amazing that people somehow focus on only 1 of the 25 points I made in the review and assume I hate this game merely because it's not on Wii U. Moved original review UP for people who can't read.  Having over 100 hours in this game now. In many parts it feels good, but there are many things that are constantly annoying, and after I think 7 patches so far the problems are still there.  Pros I can think of:   Look better than most other sims, day/night transition and weather look good   A career mode which keeps you busy   A decent number of players online   Many cars are good to drive and makes more sense than most arcade titles   Problems I can think of:   Twtichy graphics. Flickering textures here and there no matter what settings I use. Reflections and special effects often look fake.   Despite most people's praise, the game looks bad in many aspects, such as night. It looks way worse than say the new NFS. Also you can try driving behind a Mustang at night with you head light turns on. The Mustang's rear will look really bad. Same with many other cars. In addition, Azure coast and California highway don't look quite good as those screenshots.   You need to turn track detail settings to high in order to see graffiti on Nordschleife, which means they don't regard graffiti as reference points but as decoration.   In-car camera way too dark. Feels very unrealistic. It looks like you have window tint on your windscreen.   Online lobby is usually a big mess. Much bigger than sims that more heavily depends on dedicated server. Everybody makes a lobby with car/track they like, and many don't make much sense such as 5 lap race with mandatory pitstop, Formula A cars having track day with slow road cars, etc. There are lots of wreckers too.   Many cars feel stiff, and their behavior sometimes doesn't make sense.   AI is bad, they either can't drive themselves, or like to ram players, or are too pacifist and don't give chanllenge, depending on car classes they use. AI is particularly bad in Karts.   They aren't affected by weather as much as players do, which is unfair and frustrating.   Rolling start is broken. It often guarantees the 2nd place player gets to 1st when green, and there are a lot more bugs related to rolling start, which havn't been resolved since launch.   Race start sequence is fixed. The timing from the last red to green is always the same.   Track-cut detection is broken. People can still gain lots of advantage cutting the track without getting any penalty.   Engine start is the most pathetic in all games that have this feature. Instant engine start with no sound at all.   FFB feels too much spring, and the community relies on JackSpade guy's hard work to make FFB work, which should be the devs' job in the first place.   Community events/Time trial leaderboards have problems. Record on Hockenheim GP is an SLS GT3 in less than 25 seconds. I bet it's faster than a jet fighter.   Calendar in the career mode is poorly thought out. 24h Le Mans seems always in mid December which doesn't make sense. You can have multiple events on the same day at opposite side of the planet and feels very unrealistic.   UI is made worse and worse. After the new update the option button and shutdown button on the top right corner are almost invisible. What were they thinking?   No proper triple monitor support (graphics are stretched to side screens and UI is not designed to work best with 3 monitors), and the telemetry HUD is unusable on triple monitor, while other features kind of work on triple screen. This means when they first design the game, they never even think about triple screen setup, which is ridiculous since it's aiming at the sim racing community.   There is no way to change any option at all when racing. You can't even adjust game's sound volume. To get a nice FOV or to find the best video settings, you have to go into and out of races back and forth constantly, and there is no automatic visual settings. There is also no way to check you button binding when you are in race.   Many problems with physics. Rain is unrealistic. Contact between cars is broken (cars that make contact with stick to each other).   As a Wii U owner, the developers' attitude towards the promised and then abandoned Wii U version and Nintendo supporters is ridiculous.   DLCs, especially the Japanese car DLC, feel like lazy work and cash grab.   It's a nice game but loaded with problems. I think a 'Postive' rating should best describe how it is.    You don't have to read the updates below at all. ============================================================== UPDATE 3/27/2016 Repsonse to that daddy do it right guy with a reply regarding the Wii U stuff. I assume this guy is a PCars fan, and I dislike his attitude towards my negative take on PCars Wii U release cancellation. 1. Far back in 2012 SMS has confirmed a Wii U release. The Wii U logo appeared on their website, along with Steam OS version announced and confirmed. They did get a lot of funding from Wii U owners and supporters from their crowd funding campaign. 2. Since the annoucement of PCars, SMS had been constantly asked about the Wii U's capability of handling such a racing sim as PCars, and SMS had been constantly saying PCars will come to Wii U. You can still access the presentation slides here:  http://www.wmdportal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/WMD_Overview_160212.pdf  They talk about utilizing Wii U's unique controls quite a bit. 3. For people who don't own or like Wii U and believe I (along with many other Wii U owners) am 'gullible', check that slide and see on page 22 how many promised features and aspects are left out from the game or are made into paid DLCs to milk gamers. You can even find videos of Indianapolis track from early builds of the game, but the official release left this out for no good reason. 4. I'll list some quotes from SMS regarding the Wii U version of PCars, check what they said: Jan 7, 2014.  http://gamingbolt.com/project-cars-will-showcase-the-hidden-power-of-the-wii-u-slightly-mad-studios  Sep 5, 2014.  http://www.gamespot.com/articles/project-cars-wii-u-delay-theres-no-conspiracy-dev-/1100-6422143/  5. Even without a Wii U release, the PC version and console versions are full of bugs and issues. I personally will no longer support this developer. Me being gullible? No. It's this developer's attitude and expertise being far below my guess, and many others'.   UPDATE 2/6/2016 Reply to the 'if you don't want it just refund it' comment: To begin with I pre-ordered this game because I wanted to support them bring the first ever racing sim to WiiU (but then they dropped it which is disappointing), and back then there was no such thing as Steam refund.  Besides, current refund policy requires game time less than 2 hours, which in most cases will not do a fair review for racing sims. Most racing sims even need more than 2 hours to set up your controller and FOV correct. I have over 100 hours into PCars now, and I'm confident that my negative review on PCars much more fair and unbiased than other people's negative review, who only spend less than 2 hours in the game. Yes PCars for me should be more than 5/10, but due to the polarity of how Steam review works, if I'm asked 'Do you recommend PCars to people who wants a racing sim' my answer would probably be no, hence my negative review.  Also I just lost my about 80 hours career save when I change my hard drive. It seems that the save file is local and not cloud backed-up. Be careful when you reinstall the game.
3091	0	a	Im disappointed. Bought it during sale because it looked good and thought it would act like a really good car game but sadly there are too many down sides to warrant it being such a high price and released game.  Tires blow up after pit stopping which is mandatory but can be fixed by changing settigns which is a pest. AI cheats and takes pit stop on last lap meaning they get 22 seconds ahead of you and steal an unfair win. AI dont respect your car and they will not move from race line and this causes them to hit you and push you off. Penalties dont apply to AI but they do to you so if your pushed off by them they get away free but you penalised.  Overall its a good game but really needs bug fixing instead of bring out more fancy cars.
3092	0	a	After playing this game/sim in beta stages on a g25 and quite enjoying it, I thought it was an easy decision to buy the retail game.  Initially I was impressed by the visuals and dynamic weather and time. My wheel had died in the interim and I was playing on a 360 controller.  I got bored with the game after a few weeks and the controller was really ruining the experience for me. I left it for a month or so while I decided on a wheel purchase.  Fast forward a month or two, I had ordered a Fanatec CSW V2 as I didn't have the money for the Accuforce and wasn't aware of the OSW (which I would have definitely gone with had I known).  Fired up pcars in excitement. Turned a few laps. Felt rubbish. Worse than beta with g25. Tried changing settings. Still lacklustre. Tried the Jack Spade FFB tweaks, much better. Started an AI race offline. AI sideswipe me on first lap while passing on the straight. Try again. Same result. AI either has no spatial awareness or a death wish.  It may just be that the novelty of all the pretty shiny effects has worn off, but I feel as though this game has maybe gotten worse since release.   Version 3.0 FFS and the AI is borderline ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, the control system and FFB seems to be continually skewing towards control pad users (why when it supposed to be a 'Sim' I'll never know).  Dissappointed in this game. It had so much potential. As much as people bag out AC for ♥♥♥♥ physics, at least I can run a race in that without the AI ramming me like a prepubescent teen raging in gran turismo when they get passed.
3093	0	a	If you have an AMD card, stay away.  This game does not work well with AMD cards.  For now it's not recommended.   Edit:  This is my spec.  Windows 8.1 Intel i7 3770k quad core CPU (8 logical with HT), clocked at 4.2GHz. 16GB RAM AMD R9 295X2 (2x8GB) GPU SSD 256 GB Storage.  I've heard AMD are working on it together with the developer of the game, so hopefully it will be fixed soon. Also, not everyone with AMD cards seem to be having problems, looks like it could be the higher-end-cards, like 290 290x, 295x.  I'm using the 15.4 AMD driver. I also disabled one of the 290x's in my setup, still not working well. So, it's not only an SLI problem. Check the forums, and benchmarks, at least some AMD cards are not doing well with this game so far.  I tried disabling Hyper-threading and that actually helps, but it does not solve the performance issue.
3094	0	a	The disappointment of the last decade for me! project Cars was meant to be the ultimate simulation. The physics of rFactor2, the laserscanned Tracks of iRacing plus their great online community and partly realistic graphics. First apart from the graphics they reached none of their goals. They said real racing drivers helped them to develop the physics but i, as a guy who has driven a formula renault 2.0 car, can say that it is sh*t, so are the tracks the lack of details such as missing curbs or bumps that are actually implemented in iRacing is huge. Another point is the AI well if they actually survive the first turn and you have a nice little battle with them they will divebomb and ramm you of the track at the first possibility. Do not judge me wrong i love it if the AI races hard but they have to be fair like in f1 2015. so i decided to do time trial but then again i realised that the physics are sh*t, the cars have way too much grip and are way too forgiving. For example you can brake almost 50 mtr. later than in real life but you just lock up and understeer of the racing line if you turn in but you do not spin and still get a decent line to overtake. So i think this game is even worse than the good old shift 2 in my opinion because we are 7 years on now and the Handling has not improved in the slightest only the graphics are good
3095	0	a	This is my OWN EXPERIENCE with the game, good for you if the game is perfect to your standards.  One word to describe this game: Frustrating  Frustrating when you find out this game has a terrible progression system, specially because the same devs did Shift 2 that actually had a great progression system with credits and car tuning and customization. Frustrating when you are in the last lap and something goes wrong because of the game and its bugs. Frustrating that every bad thing that happens to you never feels that it was your fault, other 'simulators' transmit this feeling way better and makes you improve, PCARS just makes your Rage meter go up. Frustrating when you need to research how to make the Force Feedback Wheel feel good tweaking the very complicated and confusing settings in EVERY car because the default FFB is terrible and you can't feel what the car is doing. Frustrating when they broke promises of features and starts ANOTHER crowdfunding caimpaing for PCARS 2 just a few weeks after the PCARS 1 release riddle with bugs. Frustrating to feel that the physics don't improve with new updates. Frustrating when you feel that there is something wrong with how aerodynamics works in this game. And frustrating because there is a 'Game of the Year Edition' now, indication that they probably will drop further improvements to the game.  I put hours and hours into the game hoping for this game to get a proper polish but enough.  Bought into the hype, the hype let me down hard, you gotta give them credits, they know how to do marketing for this mediocre example of self-proclamed 'racing simulator' game which is not.  The only thing that could make this game good is the addition of a progress/customization system like in Shift 2 because besides the graphics, everything else it is just mediocre at best.
3096	0	a	Handling, physics and force feedback is not as good as Assetto Corsa. Game runs terrible on every AMD card. Framerate goes to ♥♥♥♥ when a lot of smoke is generated, using AMD cards, because of the heavy Gamework title. It's fun, but its not the king of all racing sims.
3097	0	a	If they fix the ai... this game would be a lot of fun, but it is just too frustrating to race them. They have, for me, qualified 30 seconds faster than what should be possible with the car/track combination. Half the field (even ai) qualify with 1:30, while 10 or so cars are qualifying 1:02-1:01 at Outlon with the formula C car... Then when you try to race them it is just awful. They don't react to the terrain (such as gravel, which is like glue to you, the player, but the ai seem unaffected), they follow their terrible racing line whether you're trying to pass or not, they smash into you constantly, and they sometimes fly off the road at full speed into a chicane or hairpin (even on 100%). I'm not the fastest and 100% ai is pretty easy to beat on most car/track combinations. If the driving was amazing I might even look past it (I do for AC's ai woes) but the driving is pretty meh. Honestly, wait for a few patches and see where it's at. Stock Car Extreme is a far superior product, or even AC.
3098	0	a	Sad. They bring out a nice looking game that have alot of potential, but the game isn't finished and they already talking about project cars 2. And again dlc that cost money when the game is in my eyes half finished for the price we payed. Sorry to the developers for the thumbs down but its time the communty stand up to this.
3099	0	a	Unfortunatly I can't recomend this title to anyone even at a low price. At the moment the game has way to many bugs, patches have created more. Updates will eventually fix this game but how long this will take is anyones guess. Only fit to be called early access.  Multiplayer is almost unplayable with bugs like invisilbe cars to crash into. Penalties for jump starts when no jump start commited. No systems in place to reward or penalise drivers. Most of the time you are taken out by either a really bad driver or someone who just wants to crash and bash.  Project Cars forums is also very little help as developers and backers don't like critasism and seem to shout down bug reports and complaints (Disapointing)  Hopefully in the future this game will work as advertised. 
3100	0	a	Where to start with this game. Lets start with the maps. They are great! great detail and accurate to the minor details. The cars. Pretty damn good! They need to add some more packs soon so that there will be a more diverse car selection for you to choose from. The online. Pretty bad, need to sort out the de-sync issues ASAP and it's typicaly full of foreign kids screaming at you for cutting them up. Joining servers is a pain in the *** and sometimes leaving the pit lane in qualifying is a double pain in the ***. Now then, the physics... ABSOLUTE ****. If you love pushing through the pack of cars to get to second place and then just exposing a tiny tiny tiny amount of you wheel onto the grass and getting flung around and around, then this will be £30 well spent. The countless amount of times that i've battled to get 2nd and even 1st and then be thrown to last place because of shoddy physics which bug out when you tap grass is unbelievable... You get stuck to cars when they come into contact with you, you can randomly spin out on a straight and if you dont have a rig thats above good then you will experience some lovely low frames and mysterious slow motion effects when you frames drop.   All in all, unless you have a decent rig and a great tolerance to bugs and shoddy physics then i would wait untill they patch this game up with more than duct tape and a glue stick.
3101	0	a	The game sure is pretty - but for everything that you see in the menus, it's really just a fancy overlay on really basic races. No car customization, nothing to do in career mode except click to the next race, deep track list, but most (all?) not laser scanned which contributes to the lack of feel while driving.  I thought I would buy Assetto Corsa as a holdover to this game, but it wasn't worth the wait. Assetto Corsa doesn't pretend to be all of the things that PCars says it is... but at least it delivers on the racing simulation.
3102	0	a	For all the hype, you'll be let down. It's a good looking arcade game, not sim. Bugs me that this game is so lacking in content, yet they're already talking about a project cars 2. Well congrats slightly mad studios, you got 60 bucks from me once, you wont be getting it again.
3103	0	a	Even if you set steering deadzone to 0, the game enforces a deadzone and a minimum steering angle that suddenly appears, making precise small corrections impossible
3104	0	a	I want to like this game. I do like it, mostly. The proble is that the controls don't feel realistic at all. Not even close. Even after pouring a good chunk of time into changing every concievable aspect most cars come off feeling like you are driving either a heavy truck or like you're driving on ice. This game is totally unfinished and feels like a beta release. the graphics are 7/10. The driving physics are hit and miss but not even close for something claiming to be a sim, so 5/10. The AI is garbage and on rails. I'm not great, by any means, but I know smart AI drivers when I see them and this ain't it. I bought this thinking there might be some support for it but it turns out they are already looking to PCars 2. Ah well. I'd say it's worth $15, not the $30 I spent. Even on sale, this game feels like it's asking too much. I appreciate the attempt, but the excecution falls WAY short of what is now industry standard. I'm not new to driving sims or arcades titles and this is neither one.  Edit: Something else to mention is the disappointing lack of customization and small car roster. VERY small overall roster of vehicle brands given the deep field of vehicle brands in the racing community.
3105	0	a	Game looks great, graphics are top notch - however, the gameplay, AI is terrible. Worst of all, cars feel like they are driving on ice and you have to change the steering settings far too often. Its much harder to drive a car around a corner than it is in real life..and the excuse of 'its a fast race car' actually cannot justify the slippery steering and inconsistent tyre movements of the car handling in the game. Career mode is really boring, and online play is lacking, it takes too long to find a good room. No option of automatic race/join.
3106	0	a	Played for an hour and refunded it. Gonna stick with Assetto Corsa.
3107	0	a	Edit: One year later, online is still woefully underdeveloped and the AI is no better. Poor effort, SMS.  I've had a roller-coaster of a journey with this game, and it can be brilliant when it works. Right now, the terrible AI and MP issues are destroying the experience for me.   Wait a few weeks for SMS to iron issues out. It's not worth £40 in its current state.
3108	0	a	If I ever make a let-down list, this game will be close to the top of it. I followed it's progress in the few months leading up to release and thought 'Wow, this game looks amazing. AND it's a racing sim. Perfect!'  What I got (in my humble opinion) was neither amazing, nor a racing sim. Or perfect, for that matter.  I started my first career with the first tier of karts, which I quickly learned was a huge mistake. The physics and handling models applied to them were so atrocious that I wanted to vomit. Not from motion-sickness or anyting, but because they were so bad. Yes, 125cc karts are lightweight and hug the road, but the handling was just way too unresponsive and twitchy with an xbox360 controller.  After forcing myself to finish a season of the karts career, I decided to try one of the events in which I get to drive a proper road car. During qualifying, it started to rain heavily after about 2 laps and I had posted the 2nd fastest time while the track was still dry. After pitting and getting 'wet' tires put on my car, I noticed that the AI were consistently crushing my posted lap time even with racing slicks in a torrential downpour, sending me back to 13th place. Now, I'm no expert on tire physics, but I've seen enough F1 races to know you can't drive soft-compund racing slicks in the rain and expect to have the slightest bit of grip. I thought unfair AI advantages were something of old arcade racers like NFS and not new racing 'sims'? The handling was better with the cars but still not what i would call simulation-like.  I cannot comment on the supposedly beautiful graphics because I'm running 2+ year-old laptop hardware, (Intel i7 @ 2.4ghz, 3.2ghz with turbo and NV GTX 765m graphics) but I would get sudden drops in FPS from 60 to about 45 that would last a few seconds while running medium-ish settings.  The game does, however, have a large selection of tracks and a nice selection of cars from what i saw. A little more variety in some of the car classes would have been nice, though, like the open wheels.  I was excited to pick this up on sale, but now I'm excited to hear back about a refund.  UPDATE: Less than 2 days after requesting a refund, my request was approved even though I have well over 2 hours spent on the game.   If you like your racing 'sims' with a side of twitchy, unresponsive, and inconsistent handling with terrible AI, then by all means, go for it. But if I were you, I'd wait this game out and see if they patch some of the issues that I've seen.
3109	0	a	When this game will be finished?   I try really hard to like this game but...  UPDATING REVIEW 05/03/2016 More DLCs. Same Bugs. Poor Car setup system where you can't save more than one setup by car. Poor options system where you need back to main menu just to change minimal settings, you can't even setting controll map in a session. Medium physics even for a SimCade game. Disappointment.  Really not recommended game.     UPDATING REVIEW 30/11/2015  My god, more dlc and the game still broken! Unfinished. But wait, i see they are busy developing more dlcs and Project Cars 2 for more money.
3110	0	a	A pretty game that is absolutely unfinished. Glitch after glitch after glitch. I don't even know if the AI lap times are real anymore. Sometimes coming into the pits to tune your car during practice ends in AI cars having turned laps 16 seconds faster than you! Game is not finished. Stay away!
3111	0	a	While there is no doubt that Project CARS is a more than solid Car Simulator, in terms of Features that make up a game, I was missing some key components. Most noticeably, the career mode feels like a placeholder until you find the time to make something that is fun with meaningful progress. I guess they never found the time.
3112	0	a	In this simcade racing game you spend less time battling the AI and track and more time battling bugs. Wanna play a realistic career? Damage is bugged. Wanna do an endurance race? Every single car will blow it's tires and be parked in the dirt by lap 8. Wanna listen to your crew chief? He'll tell you it's raining heavy when it's clear as day. Wanna watch a replay with dynamic weather and time? Car lights and damage are bugged (and you can't watch the replay from the perspective of other cars). Like fancy particle effects? Bugged. Wanna race clean in a packed field? Sorry, you're a target and the other cars are missiles. Need to hear your tires to know exactly what's happening with your car? Tire volume is so low you can barely hear them.  This game actually does a LOT right. The on track car count is out of this world, the graphics are great, it's well optimized on Nvidia cards (I've heard nightmares about AMD cards though), it has more options and tweakability than any racing game I've played. But it gets so many things wrong I just can't recommend it right now.  It's worth noting that similar to the Elder Scrolls games I'm having a TON of fun with the game when I'm able to look past the glaring issues. But too many of the issues really ruin the experience for me.  [EDIT] I've been wanting to change this review to a thumbs up but since writing it two patches have come out and not only have none of my issues been fixed but I've discovered several repeatable bugs. One of which allows you to shift into first and drive off before the race has started leaving the pack in the dust. When such simple things like not being able to start driving before a race don't work the game is just not ready to be called 'released'.
3113	0	a	6.8/10  Pros: -Race cars that arent home made or modded intot he game! -Tracks that let you go vroom vroom -Its pretty as all can be  Cons: -The game has a mind of its own on whether it is going to work properly or not (in game) -Pits sometimes work in some ways. This has been 90% fixed with the lastest patches -Cut content and broken promises. The devs of this game made GTR2 and then split to form two seperate dev teams. One team when on to make Race07 and its dlc and kept it very very true to the format of GTR (it doesnt hold your hand, you have to do everything, drive out the garage, hit your speed limiter, drive a safe pace lap yourself, cautions both full and partial, and open for modding)   My honest review of the game is that it is a half baked remake of race07/gtr2. Half baked int he sense that they ditched the SIMULATION aspects for the... pretty graphics? You cant even cut down a tire in this game. My honest suggestion is that if you want a hardcore racing sim get the race07 game and all its dlc, it goes on sale often for super cheap. You will get liscenced race cars from all over teh world and tracks as well. And when you want more content just get some mods and be on your merry way in anything you could imagine (ALMS, BlanPain, Le Mans, Rally, ETC)  This review doesnt even begin to go into detail on the things that i have bared witness to on their forums... That is a fiasco showing that Mr. Ian Bell is by no means a man i want to give money to based on his mouth and way of cunducting business.   I however, have already paid 30$ for this and so i aim to get my moneys worth out of it and struggle through it hoping it gets better with age and time. I ONLY reccomend getting this game if it is on sale for 25$(USD) or less. It is a '40$ brand new' title that you see many mid grade developers doing these days. i sincerely hope this game grows on me a bit more though. It has potential in about 5 years when the game's files get torn apart and modded because boy howdy being this pretty.... well the mods that will come in time will be marvelous. Shame that the team didnt allow that from the get go, but they have DLC to sell and well, the way they 'voted' on whether it was to be allowed or not was reminisent of the old '3/5th compromise' as not all votes are equal over there.
3114	0	a	DONT BUY, soooo many bugs, i get random lag spikes. it changed my settings randomly so now i have acceleration lag and steering lag (it doesnt accelerate when i push the button immediatly, or does it steer correctly.  waste of 50€ for a game they allready are making a sequal for???

3116	0	a	The A.I. is honestly some of the worst A.I. I've ever seen. All A.I. cheats in these racing games, they have to or you would crush them. The way this game is though, it is 1990's bad. Here is a list of the things the A.I. can and does do.  1. Ram you because they brake later.  2. Brake later because physics are not applied evenly.  3. When they do ram you, they are a brick and you are a bouncy ball (see evenly applied physics).  4. Go off the track and accelerate past you because the grass doesn't effect them at all.  5. Drive in the rain on slicks.  6. Drive faster than is allowed by the rolling start rules. You will literally start slower than they do, so they immediately pass you.  7. Take turns faster than you possibly can, they have the grip of the gods, see evenly applied physics.  Honestly this game's A.I. is so horrendously bad I think GT2's was better in the 90's. It's like they cut and pasted this right out of a need for speed game. Save your money, I wish I could get mine back. I would much rather be playing Gran Turismo even though its sound quality is awful. I wish so much that I could get my money back.
3117	0	a	Pros:   It is a racing game, And it runs relatively well on a razer blade while using an Xbox controller in a different state from your main computer.  Cons: It was sold as a genre redefining racing simulation using the community to help with creating all of our wildest dreams. Instead we get a half-baked buggy representation of racing (after 6 patches the Career karting will STILL occasionally not count the first lap you take), on top of poorly done physics, and in general just... It's gross.  Do yourself a favor and at least get rFactor 1. If not, rFactor 2, assetto corsa, even R3E would be better.   I'm partial to IRacing myself, but would still rather people buy any of those other games. (Also they have pretty cool devs.)
3118	0	a	Not finshed game yet.  Multiplayer with bad peer to peer games. Which leads to a lot of synchronizing issues. Not able to drive issue in a lot of cases. Wrong player list. Lap counter gets updated late in some cases etc.  Beside of all the multiplayer issues there are great graphics and a fine music. Cockpits look very great. Handling is ok, not very much a sim, its some kind of half sim, but could be fun at least if they fix the multiplayer and deliver the dedicated servers.  Only one setup is saveable per car and track which is ridiculous if you want to go online racing leagues in future. You cant save a qualy setup and a race setup for different lap races. But i think they will fix this in the future.  Tyre temp graphic is wrong in some cars.  Server browser is very bad. You cant order by anything. Filter is only for car class, not for exact cars. You cant see where the host is from. you cannot see the server settings in the server browser. How many laps for example, only short and long. No ping times etc. Very very bad.  So verdict:  I would not recommend this game at the moment if you look for a great racing experience in multiplayer. For me it is a dissapointment right now, but there is some hope it gets better with the upcoming patches. If refund would be possible, i would do it and maybe look again in some month. If you are more the singleplayer gamer, it is quite fun right now.
3119	0	a	Game is very buggy and unsupported. My game save stopped working after 10 hours of progress. All SMS cares about is money. The email addres on their homepage does not work. And I got banned from the forums for discussing issues.
3120	0	a	You can see up there that I have put 8.4 hours into Project Cars. What that doesn't tell you is that all this time (not to mention my 19 posts in the game forum) was spent tweaking parameters and tryng to make the game minimally functional. So far I have been unsuccessful. I have never - never! - joined a single race or even spent a few minutes of practice on the track.  Yes, it's a nice game, with beautiful graphics, and it has lots of potential. But, despite the hype, it is far from finished, the interface is quite clumsy and the force feedback issues make it unplayable. If you doubt me, visit the official forum. You will find literally hundreds of pages (one single thread about FFB issues has 141 pages and counting) with people trying to make sense of its obscure FFB parameters and discussing how to make the game work for them. The developers seem to be as bewildered as the users and are of little help, when not outright rude.   Project Cars has been launched some two months ago and is already patched to version 1.4, but most problems remain unsolved. Since I am one of those old-fashioned people who believe software products should be sold only when they are fairly functional, instead of being sent out on the world to have their problems sorted out by their buyers (granted, some people actually seem to enjoy that), I give Project Cars a 3/10 at best. I may review my opinion later on when these problems are fixed, but right now, if you want a racing sim that actually works, go for Assetto Corsa.  UPDATE: Now I have 13.7 hours into the game. This accounts for a whole afternoon spent trying to make FFB work. I still haven't driven a single lap.  UPDATE 2: Patch 2.0 is out, supposedly to fix FFB problems among other things. Now I have 14.4 hours in the game. The difference was the time I spent lauching PCars, finding my pilot floating 5 meters above the ground, verifying it was still unplayable with my wheel (in fact, it got worse) and closing it in frustration. I also have 34 posts in the forum without a single helpful or informative reply from the devs (contrarily to other users, who are trying very earnestly to help each other play the game). I asked Steam for a refund and I am waiting for their reply.
3121	0	a	AMD card owners stay away.
3122	0	a	I am very disappointed with the audio problems. They kill the joy. I won't be playing until it is fixed.
3123	0	a	Did I really just pay full price for this buggy alpha game? Bloody hell it's s promising and the racing is so good, but the oculus support is a joke, wheel support is a joke. I'm talking silly things like:   You spent 5 minutes selecting and calibrating your wheel. Save all of your settings, bu then when you leave and start the game over again, all settings are lost.. COME ON!  Oculus is supported, but in extended mode only, no oculus compatible menus, which means just a REALLLY awkward experience startig the race on my PC monitor and then dragging it over to the oculus display, then having to constantly recenter my oculus view (which woops, the key is now unbound becaus eit didnt save your settings!).  Also, once in a race, there is no way to access any graphics options, so when a certain option slows down your rig, or is buggy in the oculus, its a pain staking process of exiting the race, toggling 1 setting, starting a race, then exiting again, etc, etc.. COME ON!  for years in development, it's very disapointing that obvious stuff like this was missed or just not cared about.
3124	0	a	This game tries to capture the feeling of actual grand prix racing, but ultimately fails. My biggest issue with the game is the unrealistic physics. You get slides coming out of turns when you are clearly not under power, and you get AI that would rather plow right through you then actually make realistic decision. I would find it very hard to recommend this game to any racing or car enthusiast. Alas, my searce for a decent racing game continues...
3125	0	a	Initially it looks great. I can get a really good looking FOV in this game. The deeper you go, the more rough edges you run into. The menus and the way they work are a pain, often making things difficult to find, especially deeper options. I always load up this game for a few runs, but in the end something always turns me off and I head back to my other sim racers (Raceroom and Assetto Corsa), which are more focused and refined in their bases, and just offer what feels like a more realistic driving experience. Impressive at first and a good effort, but just too many rough edges to keep me around. Perhaps tries to do or be too much instead of focusing on one area.
3126	0	a	Pros:  -Sick Graphics -Nice feel to each car  Cons - AI are complete and utter ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥. They have NO awareness of where you are. You'll be driving down a straight, and they'll be alongside and cut you up, ending your race as you hit the gravel. I barely play any races vs AI due to this. They just ram you off the road. every. ♥♥♥♥ing. time  I mainly just drive around random tracks without the competitors..otherwise the rage is so ♥♥♥♥ing real.  So, if you're willing to restart a race 20 times each (due to ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ing ai), then feel free to get this game
3127	0	a	This game constantly loses its settings. Everytime I play I have to setup my controllers. It's extremely frustrating.
3128	0	a	This game has so many things going for it that it pains me to say don't touch it if you intend to invest amy more than a few hours of your gaming life. Every driving game with intentions of hooking you and keeping you coming back for more will allow you to create and save multiple car setups for each car at each track. For any serious driver, continous tuning of setups for various weather conditions and tyre strategies for example, are basic requirements. Every racing game form Crammonds F1GP1 back in the early 90's to present day allows you this joy. But not Project Cars! You have some of the best real time weather effects ever seen. You have more setup parameters than any racing game I have seen. BUT, you cannot create and save multiple setups for each car at each track. Its crazy I know but the developers did not include this basic feature that every other developer considers a must. Despite requests to fix this game killing omission none of the many patches to date have addressed this issue. In fact the developers have simply ignored it and refuse to even discuss it on their own forum? Don't buy it.
3129	0	a	User of Radeon GPU? Don't buy this game unless the producer will make game optimations and unless optimized driver support for AMD users will be guaranteed! I use Intel I7 with R9 280x with absolutely unacceptable drop of qualtiy. You can play not better than medium details. This kills a lot of the atmosphere the game could have in ultra details... / please read the www before you buy this game. I have read about this problems too late.
3130	0	a	Search for issues and bugs before buying. It may not launch until you start it without Steam. It may stop working and throw errors, requiring a new 22 GB download to install again. There's not much support offered, if any.  It can feel nice as a racing sim though, and if you have nothing else and miss GT or Forza, it can be an unforgiving - but approachable replacement as long as you're not attached to car customization or selection. What it lacks in outright car selection in the road and touring classes, it makes up for in range of car classes, more like the Pro Race Driver series.  If you like big tracks like the Nordschleife... you better have lots of time because you can't start practice/hot lap with warm tires. So that's a good 15-20 minutes just to do a fair run, assuming your car's in mint condition on lap 2.  I can't recommend it for its serious rough spots and issues, but it can be a fun and gorgeous game if it actually runs for you.
3131	0	a	Initially, when the game came out, game was unplayable on day one for me and many others, my situation was computer locking out (freezing) each time i started a race and drove my car for 30 seconds. After a few attempts at trying to solve the situation, i decided to give up and put this game on the wait-list and try again months later.  Today (18th August), i decided to try this game again. To my surprise many of the issues i had before are now gone thankfully. Yet, game is still unplayable with random issues occuring from time to time. Did a free lap session as usual to try out the game, figured i would test the game once more for potential issues. First time worked fine, i drove a racecar for a while but i didn't costumize my controls (can't do this ingame), so i quit the free lap session, which ended up in a forced game crash out of nowhere.  Now, after messing with the options and controls for a few minutes. I decide to give it a go again, to my surprise (once more), my game glitches out everytime i get in race now. Screen turns dark, i can see the pre-race menu, can't do anything from there. Sound still works, game seems frozen so i'm forced to shut down the application manually.  I would give it another try later but i really lost interest in this glitched up mess of a game, i had hopes that the game would run fine now, after a few months of its release, but nope.  In other words, don't buy this game yet, it's not worth it. You will likely run into alot of glitches and bugs, if you want to play it that badly, be prepared for anything. I see alot of people complaining in the forums about random issues, you could just end up being one of those people if you so happen to buy this game and give it a try.  Now it's time to unistall this game and add it to the pile of games that will never see the light of day again. It's a sad thing really.  PS: At the rate they are fixing the game, buy it in a decade or so, perhaps then it will be running smooth with little to no issues.
3132	0	a	great game in itself but too many issues like FFB settings not saving so have to manually set FFB settings every single time i start the game considering you have to do this for every single car and track anyway only to get into race to be slammed off the track on first corner by idiots who can't figure out what the middle pedal is for. also still no way to kick trolls lurking on the track waiting to take you out.  also with latest patch more issues have arrived like random black screen, getting stuck in pits when race is about to start, also megas issue with steering wheel going dead on entering races. possibility to be a truly great game but nagging issues kill the game for me, .... but never mind plenty more DLC to buy and more to come which i will pass on.  now they announce Project cars 2 ... so looks like they use the business model of making a core game with many bugs and promised content / features missing, the idiots will buy it, make millions in profits and not bother fixing what they released in the first place.  RIP Project cars ... i'm going back to iracing.
3133	0	a	 Nice attempt, but needs work  This game is extremely beautiful. It honestly is probably the best looking game I've ever played. If graphics alone made a game worth playing, this game would be brilliant.  Unfortunately, this is about all the game is good for in it's current state. Vehicles respond 'poorly' if I were to be kind. The game was unplayable when I first launched it because of a glitch in the FFB. I currently can not use FFB at all or the game is unplayable. Online has absolutely zero penalty for smashing into other cars nor is there a way to counteract it.   If you were to purchase this game for photo mode or to watch the opening cutscene over and over, this would be a worthwhile purchase, but in it's current state it is BETA at best.  UPDATE 5.0 Version: I've been playing since the 1.x version of the game and the controls are STILL incredibly terrible. They've seemingly made no attempts to make it translate more accurately. The FFB issues are STILL present, and you have to use 3rd party mods to make work correctly. Avoid this game like the plague.
3134	0	a	PLEASE READ BEFORE PURCHASING.   As mentioned by another reviewer, there is an enforced deadzone which cannot be removed, even though deadzone settings are set to '0'. I'm not sure whether this affects all wheels, however, it has made this game virtually unplayable in the admittedly very brief 30 minutes I have spent on it. Sadly, even when I overlook this huge issue which makes delicate steering corrections impossible, the cars feel strangely disconnected from my steering inputs, making them behave unpredictably and sadly much like RC cars, rather than than high performance cars they are advertised to simulate. This could be a personal problem, however, having spent far too much time throughout my life on racing games I can honestly say, this is a problem unique to this game. I also own Assetto Corsa, which seems to be Project Cars' main competitor and the cars in that game feel weighted and react accordingly, whereas this game offers absolutely no 'feel' for the cars whatsoever. Extremely disappointed!
3135	0	a	DO NOT BUY THIS RIGHT NOW. I have it and can not play it at all. There is an Error with the game something to do with overclocked GPUs where like for me I can not race. I can play in the menu all, but when I try to race I can only race for like 5-10 seconds for the game crashes with an error, and this happen for me all the time on SP and MP.  you can check the forums to see if it has been fixed.   http://forum.projectcarsgame.com/showthread.php?21981-Unhandled-Exception-Trapped-Unable-to-Play/page50   PLZ note that it is not the same on ever ones PC some people can race like 4-5 laps be for having an error  ------------- so would I recommend this game ---------- AS OF RIGHT NOW -- NO IF IT WAS FIXED -- YES
3136	0	a	I can't recommend this game right now. Maybe after a few patches but not right now. This game is FULL of game breaking bugs. This game could have used another delay and that would have been the smart thing for Slightly Mad Studios to do instead of rushing out this incredibly buggy game. So let me point out just a few bugs that I have been experiencing lately in Project CARS.   Can't play single player because my laps don't register so I can be racing until the end of time. When I finish a race in first place, the game will sometimes register it as last place. While racing and being in first place, the game will switch my position from 1st to last or any other position making me lose the race.   Playing online is the reason why I bought this game. Big mistake. This game is almost impossible to play online without experiencing bugs. I don't even know where to start. Lobbies are endless pits and sometimes can't start the race. Sometimes I'll be adjusting settings in the lobby and it will start the race while I'm still adjusting settings for the race. Hud display vanishes while racing, can't tell which position I'm in unless I use the cockpit view. Cars hop around the track constantly. Lets say the race is 4 players, the game will make me start at the end of the starting grid even though we are only 4 racers...I can go on forever with these bugs but I have better things to do like play Assetto Corsa.
3137	0	a	I like the game itself, but it is unbelievably frustrating that it looses your save game randomly. I've played it yesterday, turned off my PC, today started it again, loaded up the game, and it welcomed me as a new player. Save game file gone. I am not interested as much in the multiplayer part of the game, so career mode is what in it for me. But I can not enjoy it, because (for the second time) the game decided that my profile has to go. I mean come on. I wouldn't recommend it if you like playing single player, because it isn't worth it in this state.
3138	0	a	I will not recommend this game yet. It is obviously an open beta version.   The goal was:   Make the best racing game ever!    That was a complete failure! Why?   They started with a simulation and ended up with an arcade game. It not far away from games like forza. Real SimRacers who are used to RaceRoomExperience, Assetto Corsa, iRacing or rFactor can just smile about the physics. The tyre physics are completely surreal. If you are going over the slip angle and the car starts drifting you can just catch it in a split second. No overheating at all. Just a small mistake! Dfuq  The menu is crap. It doesnt work.  - Some options you take at the very beginnin cant be found again. - HUD changes are not saved.  - Replays are found behind the profile. - You cant see what session is running if you are not on the server and even then its pretty hard to figure out - you cant undo some changes like the car classes without closing and reopening the server  The sound is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Sry but even if you are not comparing it to r3e which is the game with the best racing sounds on the market atm. Its just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. To quite, to noisy, the formula cars are broken.  Replay function is broken. If someone left the race before it was finished the one is not at the replay. The complete replay hud is not working. Why should it? No Telemetrydata at the replay, you can only see yourself, its not even possible to have a free cam.   The presetups for the cars which should be an all functional standard setup. Are crap. They are made for the console guys with their controller. I can accept that. But the setups are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. They broke a lot of rules you never ever do. So some cars are literally undriveable untill you made some better settings.  BUT to be fair. The graphics are overhelming.  
3139	0	a	I got into the game. changed the graphics options aaaaaaaaaand what do you know the game dosnt even start anymore. finnaly got the game to work and looks like absolute crap. The worst engine sounds i have ever heard in a racing 'sim' games from ps2 have better sounds and mechanics than this game. My front brakes were at 1200 degrees celsius and still looking nice and shiny not even the slightest bit red games from ps2 had this feature. The engine sounds are like a mosquito in a blender. When i originaly seen this game on its website probably a year ago i seen so much potential in this game but no they screwed it up
3140	0	a	Utterly woeful game. The game has its own force feedback, which is all wrong- which means that cars can be uncontrollable at times and you cannot save a car from spinning- if you get in a spin you will hit something. The AI are rubbish and inconsistent- either slow or really fast but both times they smash you off the track, karts don't drive at all like karts do in the real world, the damage model is too sensitive and there are still too many bugs and glitches to call this game a simulator. The recent update has only made this worse, and the control settings are still idiotic.  Overall even GRID Autosport drives better than this game, best off saving your money for something else. This game is a huge disappointment- it has potential, but it seems to have been made quite badly.
3141	0	a	Doesn't even get 10 minutes of my time. TrackIR was support so I used TrackIR which gave me flying abilities (Not supported). Disabled trackIR and carried on as usual. Auto Drive driving me out of the pit crashed me into the wall, twice. And to change to neautral you have to change to first gear then to neutral.  I would list the pros but after 8 minutes of gameplay I was too disgusted to continue...
3142	0	a	Project Cars is a very average sim racing game. Assetto Corsa is miles a head in physics. Project cars doesn't even support triple screens fully like Assetto Corsa and iRacing. This game is way over hyped and is a big disapointment.   Anyway after some adjustments the game seems to be alot better, but its still not as good as iRacing imo.
3143	0	a	After +100h into career mode, all Gold accolades except for two, only 7 invitational events to unlock, the 4 longest endurance made and lots and lots of seasons the game suddenly crashes and deletes my profile. The game doesn't have Steam Cloud Sync (this game was released in 2015, absurd that it doesn't have cloud security) so I lost everything because the game wanted so.  ♥♥♥♥ it and ♥♥♥♥ SMS, this is the second time I buy a game from them and I receive utterly garbage (Shift 2 was the first but I thought EA had part of the fault).  Don't expect from SMS anything related to post-launch support, they will release the game and move into begging money for another one while saying that features promised for this game will be in the sequel.   BTW AI is too agressive, don't get affected by weather, tire wear, penaltys, etc. Shortcuts work bad, they said that it got improved, but feels exactly the same as in Shift 2. Guest in multiplayer are desynced so they can lose a race even if they win for 1s of advantage. Car categories are too limited, most of them with only one car, the game doesn't even have a log of which color pattern you like in your car and you need to select it each time you choose it. It's actually kinda funny since if you are in a multiplayer lobby and want to get your car you have to go to the full car list because the filter put by the host only works for a random pick. Community challenges are way too DLC-attached. There's an achievement (I know is optional but it works as an example) that needs you to play 20 community events, guess what? Without DLC you can't even access 10 per year.   TL;DR Don't buy this if you want gameplay, it's only good for the graphics.
3144	0	a	I bought my FIRST EVER racing wheel for this game. And I do not regret the choice ONE BIT. This game gets me sweating, cursing and screaming bloody murder as I cross the finish line. A wonderful game. Got my very first DLC, and now 'Project: CARS 2' has been announced. This game was brilliant, but I will not support the developers greed, or poor decision making with publisher choice.  EDITED AFTER PATCH 6.0: It is currently my favorate racing game, they have fixed many issues (took quite some time, and MANY MANY things are still buggy or broken. Chat boxes pit options and in general PITS) and it is very exciting to play when you can find or host a good group of fellow racers. The developer gets the thumbs down here. I am sure many more PAID DLC packs are coming on the path to Project Cars 2, which will feature many Pcars 1 assets and promises. Just like This game uses many from the 'Need For Speed Shift' series. Take it or leave it. I wish I had left it, but it can be brillant when its not asking for money, now or later.  $85 full price with all DLC, and they are THIS close to releasing the new game. Which of course will require all new DLC as well.  Leave it I say.  EDITED AFTER FORUMS VISIT: I am astounded by the snarky, and out right disrespectful comments the devolpment team has for critics. I would like the lead developer to leave his 'This is us, not supporting Pcars1 people' patch comments on Steam. I'm sure the team won't. Here on STEAM they cannot ban or berate at will (Not currently, or ever was a member of the forums)  EDIT AFTER PATCH 7.0:  DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! More bugs, no pit crews, we are seven months later here and they are trying to release another game while this is still very broken. Development team now telling users it is THEIR fault (Told not to run extended races, certain tires, wait for pit to work correctly, not to run timed races, avoid interior views during racing at sunrise or sunset...Wait WHAT?!) More disappointments.
3145	0	a	I have played over 20 racing simulation games over the years but no one was so frustratingly unplayable. It is supposed to be hard so it will be realistic but they went too far. I have played F1 games with no assists and eventually I managed to get used to the controls but with Project Cars I have just given up.
3146	0	a	Doesn't work with xbox controllers and what i hear any controller. example of one issue:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nb2Xy8ykiac  The sensitivity settings are also completely ruined for controllers, many report the only solution is to buy a steering wheel, coincedentally game has alot advertising for thrustmuster, logitech etc(wheel manufacturers) on the spalsh screen. Some have even reported fiddling with the setting for hours to find one they like and then the settings being having completely different effects after a patch. 1/10 For a game i can't play with a controller it has nice graphics.  P.S. The mount panorama bathurst track sidelines and backgrounds are pretty incorrect.
3147	0	a	It's like if Goat Simulator was a racing sim. I cannot advise any stronger that people stay away from it, and don't even consider touching it with a barge pole.  - Cars can be launched into the sky for no clear reason - Half the car can begin to levitate, and driving becomes impossible until this ghostly influence stops - AI is a mess, exceeding track limits and causing wreckless collissions every single lap of every single race. Makes career mode pointless. - Setup menu is buggy. Some settings only take effect if you save the setup then quit and reload the session. - The pit menu only opens when you're in your pit box. You sit still with your pit crew doing nothing until you've finished selecting what you want in the menu - Reporting bugs, and asking for help on the official forums will get you banned... Yes. Seriously.  PCars is only good as a hotlap sim with these issues. The bugs will ruin your races if you enter anything longer than a short sprint, or if you join a league.  The developers have their heads buried in the sand about real problems. The head of SMS (Ian Bell) has had numerous public outbursts, outright insulting people who are genuinely experiencing game breaking bugs. It's a miracle even a handful of bugfixes came out of these people post release.  0/10 would not back again. It doesn't matter what kind of racing you're interested in or what your skill level is, this is NOT the right game for you.
3148	0	a	Got AMD card? Then Don't purchase, choppy backgrounds make this uplayable... I have a fairly decent card (HD7990), and need to have pretty much all on LOW settings to achieve a consistent 60fps, but still with stuttery background... Was under the impressiom this was being 'fixed' which is why I waited... WASTE OF MONEY!!
3149	0	a	2 successfull starts or infinite loads out of 10. The greatest patch-addition I ever experienced. *gone to donate on the 2-nd edition, hah* Personal fail of the century award.
3150	0	a	The user interface is horrifically bad. Loading times are atrocious or infinite. It’s like trying to drive with bungee cords on the controls. First driving game where I have experienced elastic banding of my car in single player. WTF? Bizarre! To adjust a graphics , control or sound setting you have to leave the race and reload the main menu thus returning to the second point above. Unplayable. Very disappointed.  Do not buy. Whomever is behind this pile of festering faeces is just a pirate. More than Three million in funding and this is the result. I wonder what cars the devs are driving in the real world ?
3151	0	a	If ever there was a day and night difference between the overhyped scores of 'professional' reviewers on Metacritic, IGN etc and actual user experience then this is the embodiment of this all too common phenomenon.  This game should never have been released. I will only scratch the surface of this rotting, vulture-devoured carcass by mentioning the following bugs: - In multiplayer cars can't even exit the garage half the time, forcing you to exit and re-enter lobby.  - starting grids often start with a tornado like effect of random cars being dropped sideways on the starting grid almost as if delivered by a sky-dwelling demon. This often results in a penalty being given to the unexpecting exorcist act victim. - open wheelers drive like the chassis is made of limp carrot and the tyres are suspended on sea sponges. Formula A handling is most disastrous. - AI are to put it very kindly inconsistent. To put it bluntly they behave like a rebellious teenager experimenting with recreational drugs. The results are always unexpected. - Finishing positions are sometimes displayed in incorrect order. You might clearly finish 2nd but the results table puts you in top spot. I mean WTF? - I've lost count of the number of times the game has frozen or just shut down entirely. I could continue til the cows come home. The most conceited and enraging thing about all this - Slightly Mad Studios has the nerve to start crowdfunding for development of Project Cars 2. Send a strong message to SMS that their greed and incompetence is unacceptable. You can do that by not buying this game or better still buy it, try it and get your steam refund asap. In most other arenas of commerce this kind of behavior would be bordering on criminal. A defective product sold on the back of glamorous pre release hype is a clever, get-rich-quick scheme plotted by soul-less thieves. Now only absolute morons should contribute to round two of self-inflicted flogging.
3152	0	a	I grew up with Gran Turismo 1 and on, Forza etc, done some real racing in real life (Corvette C5 Z06 at Laguna Seca) and for me the main issue with this game is that, attempting to counter-steer out of an oversteer condition results in you over-correcting, no matter what, and then fighting it left and right and left and right until you spin out. Even completely getting out of the throttle wont prevent this. I've gone in and reduced Steering and Throttle Sensitivity all the way to zero and it still does it.   For me this is completely unacceptable. The handling in this game is down-right broken. I am using an XBox 360 controller on the PC.   I wish I learned this within the Steam refund policy time-frame.   This issue aside, the car roster is completely abysmal. The only car I drove for the few hours or so of owning this game was a McClaren P1.   The game also looks nowhere as good as it does in the trailers. This with everything maxed out. It looks very bland.   I can't recommend this game at all.   
3153	0	a	Ive not had the best past with project cars and im not sure why.   Firstly is that i have a problem getting it to run, im not sure when but it decided it no longer wished to run on either my laptop or my desktop pc's, both are very high spec which is a shame, it will get to first splash screen and then give up on trying and crash to desktop.   Afterthat is the actual game and I am basing this on back when i had the ability to play it in the early summer period.   First is the interface, its not great but its serviceable, it works but it could do with a bit of polish.  Next is the car selection, i think i like the selection, its not massively extensive but there is nice variation and each class is fleshed out rather nicely. I dont like the fantasy skins though and id prefer it if there was some sort of option to allow the skins to be 4k, maybe a texture pack that one could download but that doesnt seem possible which is a shame. The dlc car content is also nice but i think that the packs are too small and i would have prefered if there were more dlcs that were the size of the japanese pack and judging by the community it seems like they would prefer it to happen as well.  Track selection is outstanding, there is a massive number of tracks its truely fantastic but most of them are not laser scanned and i can feel it at times, like something is just missing, maybe ive gotten a little too used to laserscanning, maybe its a placebo im not sure.   Next is the driving, people can go on and on about the physics as to whether they are realistic or not, are they challenging, does assetto corsa have better physics, its a battleground a lot of the time with that debate. Anyways in my opinion the road cars feel way off, they are horrid, i cant even touch them because they just put me off a ton. But race cars are what matter most anyways, they do feel a lot better than the road cars but i still get a faint feeling that the grip just isnt right, maybe that is to do with the feedback that i get or the times where the cars show behaviour which doesnt seem right, its a bit like the uncanny effect that we have to faces where the closer we get the more we notice slight problems, same with this, even without getting extremely technical i find that it just doesnt feel right at times.   Graphics: Personally speaking i have an unpopular opinion and that is that pcars doesnt look nice at all in its vanilla presets but thats because i try to search for the immersion factor of reality and the chromey effect that vanilla pcars has is very bad at this thankfully there are mods that can fix this and with those applied the game looks outstanding, the tracks have a great level of detail, the cars for the most part look great bar a few things.   Sounds: No, they are just bad, as i said earlier i search for immersion factor. Project cars fails massively here because it does it wrong, they focus on trying to make a car sound good instead of sounding like how it should of which they have failed with a very large majority of cars here. There are common sounds that are copied, they took the sounds and set a preamp of something crazy like +5db and its a crazy distorted mess. I understand that some people like this sort of sound but I personally cannot stand it. I think this is the poorest part of the game.   Racing features: They do rather well here, there are a few oddities with the pits where you cant control it and being inside an ai instead of waiting but for the most part the racing ruleset and features are close to class leading and why people say that it had a lot of polish.   Online: I didnt race too much online so i cant comment much here.   Career/AI: I liked the concept, some people questioned the reasoning behind it but racers will know, the euphoria from earning it is what matters, you dont need some carrot dangled in front of you to race sadly this immersion is lost a bit because the AI simply isnt face, i can best them with the default setup easily and im a rather average paced sim racer   In the end though ive encountered too many issues with the game such as getting my wheel to register, dialing in ffb being harder then it needed to be granted guides helped a ton with this, AI being problematic in open wheelers and modding something as simple as a skin should be a bit easier to do. Also the minor problem of it not running on either of my rather powerful systems is a shame and I will not recommend something that doesnt work.
3154	0	a	The more I play it, the less I like it. The dynamics are way overdone beyond simulation. Without a wheel, don't bother. Without perfected throttle and steering control, theres absolutely no skid pad or room for mistakes or fun beyond simulated driving in this game. Looks great, sounds great, all the options are amazing, lot's of neat positives in this game and all the cool race trakcs as well. Decent game all around, just dosen''t have the fun handling.
3155	0	a	Theres a good game here, if you can see it through all the bugs.  I got the game a month or two after release. I bought it to play multiplayer in private matches with my brothers. So that is the only area I have really given any time to.  Unfortuantly even at the time of writing this review, half a year later, the multiplayer is still riddled with game breaking bugs. Silly ones like it always ignoring your qualifying position and falling through the floor. There were plenty more.  Its a shame, as I know I would really like the game if it wasn't for the bugs, but the frequency of the bugs are too great. In the last gaming session I had prior to writing this, not one race went by with out some oddity or other happening. Some were quite bad, others were amusing. but all in all it ruined our experience.  They have been releasing patches at an OK rate, but still its massively bugged. Single player maybe fine, I don't play it.
3156	0	a	The worst GT racer I've ever had the displeasure of playing... Very bad AI to a point that it feels like i'm playing with 10 yr olds on-line who are hell bent on me not finishing the first lap! Weather is a complete joke suns out 2 corners later it's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ it down and by the end of the lap it's like blackburn on one of it's more common rainy days then by the end of the next lap the sun's out it's bone dry I've got my shorts out along with the factor 50!! Pit crew can't tell the difference between classes 'keep pushing and you'll have them on the next straight!' Sorry I'm in a GT4 car and the next car is a GT3!?! WTF!! I think I'm good but serously as my car been fitted with something I don't know about?! Good points are that I can turn it off and play something else..
3157	0	a	TLDR: Project Bugs - 'The Devs know about the problems, but it will surely be solved in PCars2'  My review is based on over 540 hours of multiplayer gameplay. The more you play this game the more bugs you will encounter.   First off the cars sounds different online compared to offline, the 'whine' sound from the gearbox or whatever is not present in multiplayer until the 2nd game in the same lobby and it's a well known bug. This makes some cars sound quite different and in some cases quite dull and boring online.   Then comes the steering ratio bug, when I first load into a session and go out of the pits, the steering ratio will always be 900 degrees no matter what car, and requires and Alt-Tab to overcome this(may be my ancient wheel is to blame). Not forgetting to mention changing your steering ratio in setup requires a session rejoin to take effect.   Ok then I'm ready to go on with qualifying, or at least try to. You see everyime someone joins the session you get a split second delay (I get about 0.5 sec of screen freeze, some people get up to 3 sec). Imagine driving in Monaco and you get that freeze? into the wall you go, freeze while you're under heavy braking? you WILL overshoot the corner, freeze while turn in? wide you go, freeze while on the straight? you're fine. It's a lottery while trying to do qualifying. Gone are the outlap-hotlap-inlap style, you HAVE to put like 5 laps fuel and go round until you HOPEFULLY get a clean lap.  On to the race. Theres a bug where cars spawn on each other, if a car happen to spawn on top of you and lands on you, you WILL get a drive through penalty because your car moved. If anyone decides to jump the start and hit you = drive through penalty for you. If you manage to survive the race start then great. Since my location gives me about 250 ping I'm always delayed at the start and lose places but I don't think this is the game fault, I can't upgrade distance to server. Also I can jump start like 0.5 sec to 1 sec without penalty, or maybe it's because of my ping, or another bug.  On to the racing. Cars will STICK to one another on side contact. Once 2 cars touch, they lose all steering capability and will just slide straight off the track or until they come apart. Penalty system is literally useless. There is NO PENALTY FOR RAMMING. Imagine T1 at Monza, someone hits you and you're forced through the chicane at T2, the rammer just continues on because he's still on track, you on the other hand are considered to have 'CUT THE CORNER' and get a 10 SECOND penalty where you can't accelerate. There is another abuse where you can cut chicanes without penalty and gain massive time in a race. Track limits is also another problem, on some corners 1 wheel on the grass is considered cutting the track but on some other corners you can go all 4 wheels off and hit the wall and yet it is not considered cutting the track, with this technique you can actually gain time on some tracks by 'wallriding' or you can run wide on some corners and gain time(eg. Degner 1 &amp; 2 at Suzuka).  Onto car setup. Some settings are just not realistic. On some class like GT3, running 0 camber is still the best. And then there is the abuse of running 0 radiators &amp; brake ducts. The telemetry for tyre temps is inaccurate for the inside, center and outside of the tyre. Using full negative camber can result in higher outside tyre temps. Also the left front bump stop seem to be the only one that can hit 'red' and not the other 3 bump stop corners. 'Live' telemetry is not that useful because you have to drive and see telemetry at the same time which is hard. You can download apps for telemetry recording but the problem is suspension is not part of the numbers which you can see, and suspension setup is critical for a race car. You can only have 1 setup per car/track combo, so if you want to have multiple setups you have to manually record and enter it. There is a 'summary screen' in setup where you can screenshot but it doesn't include all the settings you can do on the car so it's kind of pointless.  Chat was broken a few patches back and never fixed. You cannot chat in the online lobby, you have to drive out of the pits, park somewhere and chat. Vote kick function doesn't work, only the host can kick. There is a bug where it auto kicks people randomly in the session.  Replays are completely broken and never fixed since game launch. Cars parked on the grid, missing cars etc. Saved a replay where you just had an exciting race? or a collision? Go to check it out and see yourself racing against nothing, crash with nothing. Completely useless feature.  If you like hot lapping and top the leaderboards you have to abuse the 0 radiators &amp; brake ducts to get the 'perfect' lap. Also since there's not gearbox protection you can downshift like a mad man 6th gear to 2nd gear in a second to maximise engine braking without penalty, and you can off tyre wear so your tyres don't degrade throughout the lap.  Having spend some time in the official forum you read about all the problems people have with the game, promised features which will never be in the game, and also all the bugs which will never be fixed. Forum threads questioning the developers on these topics often end in arguments and the thread closed. Some 'top people' will defend the game with their life even though there are so many problem with the game itself. It's like they're blinded by something and don't want to see the issues. I even saw an insta-ban on someone for insulting the game. It seems the common answer to every problem with the game is 'It's a well known bug', 'The Devs are aware of this', and the most popular is 'It will be solved in Project Cars 2'  Resources spend for fixing the game is less than resources for new DLCs. Makes sense because it is a business after all but if your product is of such low quality then you will lose more people compared to people buying the DLCs.  Other stuff you will encounter include: Hitting invisible wall/car while leading Driver floating without car Driver floating in mid air(Imola chicane) Hitting a landmine(literally car flies &amp; flip) - too bad for you FFB bug where it feels like you have a flat but you don't - requires game restart Total lost of steering wheel functions - requires game restart Screen freeze but sound still works - requires game restart Opponent car stuck at 45 degree angle, creating smokescreen for everyone behind Qualifying 1st only to discover someone beat you with a time of 00:00:0000 Cars spawn on other cars/upside down on the grid, or in pitlane during race start  'But hey maybe all this will be solved in PCars 2 eh?'  Overall I give this game a 5/10 and that's being generous. Only because of the fun racing I have with the friends I met racing online. If you plan to buy this game for serious racing then don't, this is a 'Sim-Cade'. Only buy if there's a massive discount. There are better sims on steam which are cheaper, have better physics, and less bugs.  edit* typo
3158	0	a	No Linux / SteamOS support from Slightly Mad Studios is a real shame. It was advertised everywhere and as time goes by, official site faq and forum has been purged from everything related to Linux version. No project Cars 2 for me.
3159	0	a	Still one of the worst racegames to play with a controller. I've played Grand Prix Legends, rFactor and Assetto Corsa with a controller and all of those game handle it a thousand time better than Project Cars. (which released on consoles!) There is something wrong with the response curve of the joysticks in this game, which make every tiny movement in the center of the joystick too aggresive, but big movements to the outside of the joystick too slow.   This is the only racegame I've ever played that has this problem and there is just no way to fix this.
3160	0	a	This review will be strange to some. And dont be fooled by my 'hours' on record. It's more. This is just what I accumulated with this install.  Project Cars is in mnay ways the driving / racing sim everyone wanted. Easy to pick up and hard to master. But...SMS is not delivering what they promised.  There were too many day 1 bugs...as if no-one quality checked it. Then there are the many bugs that persists to this day...with most updates seemingly happily focused on ramming more DLC down our throats.  One of the most annoying is how cars can just magically disappear from replay saves. And dont get me started on the actual replay system. It is truly horrendous. And for a long time all of these things could be overlooked simply because the actual racing is so damn awesome. But no more...not with it becoming clearer by the day that the developer is more concerned with pumping out DLC and planning a big UPDATE in the form of PC2 than they are with fixing a product people paid large amounts of money for. It has this unethical flavor that just makes everything in my mouth bitter as hell.
3161	0	a	BUT WAIT.... this is the main motto of this game. I am a big motor head when it come to cars and racers. and when i saw this i said yes its finnaly here. But wait. Looks nice, the cars look very pollished and neat. in car looks to be real, idk dont own many of these cars. but it looks good enough for me, but wait the aspec in the car is lacking of any redefinment so your stuck with that postion. the drive is great all the phyics, but wait most cars feel like boxes with no real suspension in them at all, over steer and under steer has never been so big. cant tune it out and that if you know what to tune, no real guide for anything, carrear mode is cool all those division and all open but wait not all the divisions are open and the seasons seem formless race here race their then do it again. by the way you cant select the car you want you get the sponsor's car and the sponsors mean NOTHING not bonus or even diffrent voices in car. I love this Game but wait. it dissapoints but offer so much hope.
3162	0	a	not sim racing but bugs racing
3163	0	a	If you want a good sim, try Assetto Corsa or even RaceRoom Racing. Heck, even rFactor2. Project CARS is really good looking, and may work for arcade players who want a console-y feel for their game, but the force feedback is horrible, the cars feel floaty and the AI is so aggressive I can rarely finish a race without they ramming into me.  tl;dr: not a bad game, but a bad sim.
3164	0	a	Hello all,  In terms of content Project CARS is really nothing to complain about , plenty of tracks, plenty of cars. The weather system is something I would want to see in Assetto Corsa but I know that won't happen I guess. In terms of the sense of speed , that is lacking, it is a bit of a bummer. The feeling of cars or tracks is a bit of the downside of this game. For example I drove the P1 around Spa, the bumps, the curbs were not there in the meaning of I couldn't feel them through the wheel (G27). A little bit inward the curbs you got these little bumps which I could feel. Then we get to the car, the P1 there was no connection to the road, I should've felt something but the only thing I felt was the rear stepping out on various occassions , 1st to 3rd gear in a straight but also in 5th gear through a high speed corner, I mean come on guys you delayed the game soo many times already and yet this happens? 3rd or 2nd gear exiting a corner I can imagine the back stepping out but , 5th gear on quarter to half throttle going more than 160km/h (100mph) is a bit absurd. Yet on some occassions the cars felt good and some occassions the cars felt like boats. My fears before release became clear : Oh dear, Here we go with a yet another simcade game trying to be a simulator, but failing at trying to be one. I heard many players having the same opinion as me, yet I heard players who like it. And these kinds of people I like to categorise in : sim-racers and arcade-racers. I expected Project CARS to have similair car-physics as Assetto Corsa but what I felt was less than that. For arcade-racers to find a new challenge this is a game for you, for sim-racers like me it's a dissappointment.  Graphics wise, the cars are sublime , nothing wrong with that, weather-effects the same thing. Tracks could've had some  more love in the end.  Despite this I nor hate or love the game. Every game has it's flaws , but this games has the flaws where I didn't want it to have them. 5/10 - It was promising but a let down after all the hype around it.  --------------------------------- New Section : Third day of playing  This is what I noticed over the third day of playing Project CARS.  First of all lets start with the animations, I use with my G27 the H-pattern on the cars that have it, Nothing wrong with that? Well the animations of shifting seems first fine from neutral to first all is well, from first to etc. you see the animation going for neutral then being cut off and restarted for the animation to the selected gear which is annoying after a while and for me noticeable at the third day of looking through what is wrong. What is more wrong, is the rain effects on the front and side windows of the car, because if you want to implement rain you need also take notice of the windspeed and the speed of the car, because the flowing air makes the rain drops move in certain directions, as for the rain drops in pCARS they are static pretty much at whatever given speed.  Next part about the rain drops involve the windscreen wipers, after the windscreen wipers cleaned an area and they go back in an up right position you see for half a second in light rain or a thunderstorm / heavy rain, that a certain is dry. Rather more than that is the water particles from the wheels as they go through the car model ( only seen in third person camera behind the car ).   Further more some cars like the, BMW 1M or RUF RGT-8 do have incorrect engine sounds. So are more cars like that. There a few cars which I find driveable are the Renault Clio Cup car, the Aston Martin Vantage V12 GT3, the Ford Focus RS, the RUF RGT-8 despite the lack of a good engine sound.   Trackwise, I drove a few laps around Sakito GP not sure if I said it right (Suzuka, a real track located in Japan) missed some corners, I don't know if this is done on purpose or not, there can be a reason which I or we don't know.   Despite this I can find some fun in the game.  Now for the online gameplay, it's well done with the lobby's and interfaces. But, the following was a HUGE let down for me, probably for others as well, after a while my steering wheel was no longer recognized and i had to force quit the game and restart the game, one of my friends had to restart his computer to get his wheel working again. After that we could play a nice round on Watkins Glen Short.   The score of my rating stays the same, I won't lower it because it is already given.
3165	0	a	This game feels unfinished. Too many bugs such as , stuck in loading screen, textures, and sometimes the brake assist will bring you to a complete stop before you even enter a corner.   Pros: +great lighting +decent graphics +good music Cons: -bugs bugs BUGS -Horrible car sounds. My Honda sounds better than the Gumpert Apollo in this game. -Terrible AI  Do not buy this game. It is not worth the time or money.
3166	0	a	Project Cars is, when all is said and done, a very middle of the road racing game. The physics are okay, the graphics are okay, the sound is on the poor side and the single player experience, despite first impressions, amounts to a very bare bones structure.  Physics - Touted as stunningly realistic with 'best in class tyre model', feel very muted. Even with all assists off it still feels as though all cars have some amount of traction and stability control enabled, the behavior of cars at low speed is weird and in most cars it's impossible to do a burnout as you can in any other simulator.  Visually comma it's mostly just an okay looking game, in certain weather conditions and times of day it can look very impressive but it is not the photo realistic tour de force that it has been made out to be in promotional shots and various shill articles from around the internet. Sound, which in the lead up to release was touted as being one of the game's killer features is actually on the poor side. Engines sound clipped and distorted, which can be a cool effect, but in Project Cars sounds tinny and lacking oomph. Cockpit rattles, backfires and tyre squeal are serviceable but nothing exceptional.  The AI in single-player is slow, even on the hardest difficulty, any competent racer will find that they don't put up much of a fight. They also have difficulty keeping off each other and it's not uncommon to find them all dog piled on top of each other on corners they find a bit tricky.  The games true killer feature is the dynamic weather. Setting the weather to random is great fun and really adds something to the game that the other sims don't have. It's also during rain that the game engine really looks its best with terrific looking pools of water forming on the track and atmospheric lighting, it really makes for an immersive experience.  Most troubling is the games current state in terms of stability and features. The game is supposed to have fully animated pit crews, but as of patch 2.0 this is still not in the game and who knows if it's actually going to be added. You also don't need to look very hard to find the plethora of bugs still present in the game, with cars absorbing into each other, flying into the air and falling through the track. The collision physics are also very odd. Touching another car seems to mute your steering, often causing both cars to just carry on off the track, sort of glued to each other. These issues combined with the announcement of Project Cars 2 along with it's funding campaign leaves a bad taste in my mouth.  Project Cars is not a bad game, but it feels unfinished and even with the polish it needs, I am not confident it could match the single player experience offered by games like Stock Car Extreme and RaceRoom. If you are someone who enjoys weather effects and cares more about immersion rather than the racing, Project Cars will have something to offer. Otherwise, don't bother.

At £39.99 for the initial Game + £40.09 for DLCs bringing the grand total to £80.08 for a f**king average game I think its safe to say that this game for me is way over priced and certainly not worth the money I paid.   I've done more hours on old rfactor and SIMBIN titles for a fraction of the price, with more fun and community content than this game can ever give me and thats whilst already owning this game.   Its a good game, but its definately not worth the £80.08 (Euro 102.84 / $115.88) that you will have to pay for the full game including DLCs.
3169	0	a	[50 hours in game] Ugh 'Project Cars' will be known as the biggest racing game flop in history. EVEN with the limited edition pack you barely get any cars without buying DLC and their mostly European! I mean sure there are plenty of Fords but how can you flat out ignore the other great manufactures out there? I'm really surprised project cars has not learned from GT6 that players actually like driving cars from their favorite manufacturer? Also a real killer is the fact that there is ZERO customization for the cars, you cant even change the paint color which seems essential. When they say 'we listened to what the players wanted' they really do not mean that, I cant see a single player actually wanting only 30 (I know i may be off a bit) cars to chose from. The only pro I have with Project cars is the graphics, which can STILL be horrible it does not matter what monitor or GPU you have, textures will still be tearing everywhere and if your CPU is not top of the line it will still be imposible to play agianst any AI. Just get GT6 guys or GT7 if their making it (I do realize its a console game but seriously, its better than this ♥♥♥♥ and this is coming from a strongly PC oriented player).

3171	0	a	All style, no substance. It looks nice. It’s clear this was the focus of the developers as every 2nd race takes place at dusk for no other reason than to show off the graphics at the expense of the gameplay.  The AI is HORRIBLE. The worst AI I have ever seen. They spend more time off the track than on, and have no clue what to do when your car is near them, they either drive straight into you, or clean off the track to avoid you.  The handling is mixed, between “okay and “terrible. I’m a sim racer using a wheel. My first race was in a hot hatch that kept losing the back end somehow every time I lifted off the throttle. I spent ages recalibrating, trying driving aids, but couldn’t solve it. That level of simulation would embarrass Sega Rally. Occasionally you find a car that handles okay and you see what this game could have been.  The racing is flawed. You can massively cut corners and chicanes, overtaking dozens of cars. The annoying team radio guy tells you the stewards will “pull you off if it happens again. I haven’t been disqualified, penalised, or pulled off by any stewards while playing this game.
3172	0	a	This game is more of a dissapointment, than a bad game. The lack of content really bugs me.  I will say the game is solid graphics are good. The sound however is terrible, and always glitchty, and that really robs the immerision. The fake social media like menu is another thing that shouldnt be there at all.  To keep this short if you enjoy playing from time to time doing hot laps everyonce in a while than this game is for you.  But if you are looking for a hardcore sim racing experince i would look elese where like Asseotto Corsa.   Even though that game has issues, its in game content and moding comunity is huge and immersive compared to project cars I dont hate this game and i wish there was a mixed button, but i wouldnt recomened it to everyone.
3173	0	a	I didnt like it. It feels quite boring, that's why I would not recommed ıf you are looking for more 'fun'
3174	0	a	Choose the correct answer. Today while playing Project Cars (after patch 2.0): a) My vehicle was permanently stuck in the garage in an online qualifying session b) At the start of the race I was penalised with a pit stop even before moving off the starting grid c) Pcars crashed 3 times within half an hour while loading an online race d) I finished an online race in 1st place yet I was placed in 2nd on the results table e) In career mode AI set at above 90 difficulty constantly ruined my race with suicidal driving f) all of the above Yes the correct answer is indeed F yourself SMS
3175	0	a	With how the developers of this game seemingly moved on to Project CARS 2 so shortly after this was released (they were crowdsourcing for PCars 2 barely a week after PCars 1 first launched), I feel like that I paid full price to do their beta testing the whole time I played this game. The game remained fairly buggy after numerous patches, and during my time with the game, any criticism on the PCars forums was commonly met with hostility from the game's supporters and occassionally a banhammer.  While I like the variety of cars and tracks that Project CARS 1 has to offer, the toxicity of the community and its developers don't give me much hope for PCars 2 whenever that comes to fruition.
3176	0	a	It's a fun game, but way too many bugs and issues to recommend this game at the moment.
3177	0	a	asking for a refund on this game why? - horrible sound, i dont know if it is a bug or something but i tried in various tracks with different cars and the sound of everything else besides the engine is a joke (i never had similar problems in other games). -Yes the game is beautiful, but it has serious problems with frame rates, especially in keeping them, i run the game at high-med settings with frame rates between 30-60fps, it doesn't sound bad, right? well when the game works well yes it is awesome, but i suffer of frame drops and skipped frames all the time, this shows how bad performance is with AMD cards -restarting the game to apply visual settings, this one kills me, we are in 2015! this is not acceptable... With all this performance problems i didnt get much time to drive, but for what i felt this game is not bad at that aspect. Like many people say the game does not look finished, i found 2 bugs in the little time i played and there is not many tracks to choose from and neither are cars (yes you can buy dlcs but at this price the base game is kinda empty)
3178	0	a	At the moment, Project CARS isn't an absolute failure, but I feel my money could have been more well spent. Short review, TLDR form:   EDIT: Changed some words and opinions after re-playing with sufficient sleep. &lt;3  Pros: -Amazing car graphics -Finally, a nice-ish damage model -Variable weather -Oh the list of cars is fantastic.   Cons: -Physics are varied - overall they need improvement, but some cars more so than others (looking at you, Lykan). -Tracks are not as detailed as some of the game's peers (esp. Nordschelife). -Very little sensitivity and feedback - I don't feel like I'm in control.  -Sounds are bad. Definitely needs improvement. At times it's muffled, at times it hurts, and some cars sound off (a C9 should not sound like it revs to 9000...).  I suggest SMS and WMD put a hold on the weekly car release thing that they have planned and focus more on fixing the physics and the sounds first. It would make this game more fun than a wrestling match with my Zonda Cinque whose rear wheels have read too much Orwell and want to break free of my control.
3179	0	a	If you are just starting out and are running nvidia graphics it may be worth your money and time. - pro: track and car selection  - contra: bad amd optimization   Everyone else: AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE   If you want a hardcore racing sim, choose something else. - pro: engine stalling, shifting requires clutch (better than AC) - contra: grip and slide snapback too forgiving If you want to play online against unknown people choose something else - pro: ingame server browser - contra: wreckers, quitters   Not to mention the stupidity behind ex-SlighlyMadStudios, their lead devs and their attitude towards users  Also the crowdfunding marketing ♥♥♥♥ which biased the early reviews, and made people believe this was any good.
3180	0	a	There's probably an awesome game behind the bugs, but in like 4 hours i've spent with this game, 2h have been looking up solutions for bugs and redownloading/verifying, 1,5h tweaking settings and only half hour of actually driving. I'm sure it's going to get better but it still gets my downvote. I advise buying only when on sale (i bought it 66% off) and arming yourself with patience for the first few plays.
3181	0	a	I can play Assetto Corsa, because I drive a car. But I have found you must learn to play Project cars, because it's not quite right.  I suppose I must ask....Did they play Assetto Corsa?  Good: Graphics are very good, but you will need a mean machine to max out the settings. Lots of racing options although AI is a bit crap Looks like online is the place to be.  Bad: The feel of the cars out of the box is just poor, especially compared to AC.  Force Feedback needs lots of reading and patching to try to fix this and it's 'better' but still not at AC level.  I will continue to tweak the game and maybe, I can then recommend it as a Sim.   
3182	0	a	I bought this game when I read the recommendations of this game. Graphic is simply the best I ever saw in racing games, but... Handling of cars is really, really terrible. Overstearing in almost every corner, validating times is some almost impossible think, if you run through the corner and due to really overstearing thing in this game, you just a little miss the outside way of the corner and time is not validated, omg why???? (not talking about inside of the corner, thats understandable when you shorten the corner that the time is not validated).   This game is really not worth the money, it is pain to focus all the time and even when you focus, cars behave like nothing real. I have really bad car in my real life, but I can run through any corner in real life at higher speed than in this game and comparing the stearing at low speed has nothing to do with real simulation.   I like realism, but not unreal realism, this game could be more fun with arcade stearing exept of trying to make something real.
3183	0	a	Looks completely Horrible on the Vive and buggy as hell. Very low resolution, jaggies all over and terrible frame rate. Everytime you have to tweek a setting - the game requires a reboot. And then more often than not, wont start in VR mode with restarting the system.  I played with every setting, and could never make much impact on its looks. Its certinaly the fugiest game I have yet tried on the Vive.  Classic case of something being retofitted and not really being fit for purpose. Avoid, unless you are a diehard fan.
3184	0	a	Sadly Project CARS does not live up to its own hype and expectations created when the game was first relaesed.  There are still many unfixed issues which the devs and community said would get fixed but didn't. It all looks like a bit of a cash grab from the developers now, they claimed that starting work on pCARS 2 would not affect the continued support of pCARS 1 but that is simply not the case, many 'features' (I would call them requirements) like triple screen support were supposed to be implimented and are all of a sudden going to be in pCARS 2 instead (except this info was only 'shared' on a post within the forum, same as a lot of the ommissions and back tracking the devs have done since release), all while they still churn out monthly paid DLC. The patches are getting smaller and smaller with less fixes which proves they are no longer working on the core of the game, which is still a mess in places.  I'm glad I never put money into pCARS 2 as I can see the devs playing the same cash grab scam as the first, promised the world, released it broken, patched it to a beta state, don't mention all the stuff that they are not going to impliment, let time go on so that people who invested good money into it don't feel so sore about it then slowly leak the fact that your not going to deliver what was advertised, nice strategy.  This game has some good points about it, there is a big if bland career mode, and the driving model is nice but the lack of ability to save more than 1 set up for a car (seriously this was achievable back in days of the Amiga, it's 2016 FFS), dodgy collision physics, odd wet weather tyre behavour (especially the AI, this has been 'fixed' apparently yet still exists in certain circumstances), no real multi-class racing (hey look we have prototype 1 and 2 and GT3, but were not going to let you race them together because clearly our game engine can't cope with it) which ruins the career progression for me in this regard, very inconsistent AI meaning you never run at the front with the same guys race to race (this is again shocking, Amiga racers had this, c'mon), no custom championships (yes another staple of most early 90's racing games seems impossible in 2016 for SMS) along with a plethora of small niggly little bugs and issues that culminate to make the experience one of frustration rather than fun.  My advise, wait to see what pCARS 2 produces, do not buy it on release, read the forums (don't for heaven sake post there, especially with anything less than wishing to suck the balls of the developer or you will probably get banned) and see if they are capable of producing a sim that lives up to even half the hype they surround it in.
3185	0	a	Slightly better Shift 2, nothing more.
3186	0	a	way to complicated than it needs to be. Fuel consumption, ware and tare on tires, no thanks. folks online way too rude. it just wasent fun for me.
3187	0	a	This games engine is just bad, plain and simple. If you plan on using a controller, do not buy this. If you have a wheel setup, bare in mind that this game has overly complicated settings to the point of being annoying as you have to adjust steering ratio for every car. Correcting oversteer is near impossible, and wheel spin will randomly shoot you sideways with no feedback prior.
3188	0	a	I get you have to heat tires up... I get you have to warm the brakes... But when the handling tries to be ARCADE-SIM! THAT IS WHERE I DRAW THE LINE! I couldn't adapt to the handling...
3189	0	a	this game is unhandeled and i can't play this game!
3190	0	a	I reviewed this title when it first launched with pretend VR support. Lets fast forward all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that happened inbetween with the constant glitches, bugs and horrible dev responses. Lets look at Official Oculus Rift launch day.   This was ment to be an Oculus rift launch title. Well, it is. However, they've completely forgotten about their original backers and earlier adpoters by forcing them to buy the entire game again ($91aud) or buying all of the DLC ($65aud) to get a key to the Oculus version of pCars. The only other options are to stay on 0.8sdk. What kind of options are these? This type of greed is not acceptable to backers or early adopters or anyone for that matter.   What about VIVE launch you say? Well that launches early April. With SMS not even making an attempt to respond to this very question countless times, I think it's safe to say VIVE support will be screwed or non existent come launch day. From what I've read, I could only imagine Oculus trying to run 1.3 through STEAM VR to be a horrible experience and resource hungry.  Now add these issues ontop of the 12 months worth of issues (some of which are still not fixed) and you then ask yourself, will you support SMS with pCars 2? Or any other title? No chance will they ever get a cent off of me. Never. ♥♥♥♥ing. Again.
3191	0	a	A game that was carefully marketed, but which did not live up to the projected expectations. I stick with Assetto Corsa.  * Poor graphics * Limited cars * Limited tuning
3192	0	a	PROJECT CARS  Nice graphics, Stunning sounds and... that's about it really, in my opinion. This game is not a bad sim/arcade-ish racing game that have a decent amount of cars and race tracks also the modding scene is only as far as a custom livery but still pretty cool.   I play this game casually just to enjoy the sounds of the engines and dem graphics, but if you're looking for a proper sim racing game get Assetto Corsa or rFactor/2 if you want to go a step further with your sim racing experience get iRacing.
3193	0	a	AMD FX 8350 32gb 64bit win 10 OCZ SSD  NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970 Thrustmaster TX wheel  Looks awesome with a huge unplayable BUT...  Running this game with everything in graphics hardware set to LOW and including dropping the resolution to 1920 x 1200 i still get severe graphics lag ending up with me crashing out on corners because of this. Unplayable for me so going to stick to other racing titles until theres a fix  I have no issues like this in any other games i own  UPDATE: went back to try this again and with my pc rig havving had no hardware changes something has changed for the better... it plays a lot better so some patch must have sorted a few issues? i can manage about 5-10 cars before i get the micro stutter effect happening so i keep under that and i dropped my graphics to mid which is still way better than any other racers graphic content :)  All in all im well happy now and after my next pc upgrade ill get to try it at ultra settings. Lovving the create server options!!!
3194	0	a	I honestly can't recommend this for ATI owners... The problems that existed at launch still linger, with the game suffering severe framerate issues even with rather conservative settings applied.   If I ignore all that, there's something that could be fun hidden beneath - though it requires players to be patient and invested in authenticity over the more immediate action of competitors like Forza. In the end I've come away feeling like this whole 'needing to practice and qualify before a race' thing just isn't for me, and it seems a shame that the game doesn't offer a slightly more streamlined approach to the career mode for players who just want to experience the main events. You can manually skip to the main races, but it hamstrings you, putting you at the back of the grid each time. In the end I just got bored.  Perhaps my view has been skewed by the frustration I've felt spending hours fiddling with graphics settings and drivers, and maybe the smoother experience on offer for nvidia players will genuinely lead to more fun, engaging play sessions. Alas, the experience I've had has not been worth the investment (in money   or  time). I only hope Slightly Mad stop blaming AMD for their QA problems and do a better job next time.
3195	0	a	Would be a great game without the crashes and bugs needs patching and shouldnt of been released yet
3196	0	a	I really wish I could recommend this game. There are some moments where it's the best racing game on the market....then you run into one of the lengthy list of bugs/UI quirks/questionable design decisions that plague this game.  Their forums are a toxic environment as well. You list the bugs/issues and you either get your posts deleted, comments from backers saying that these issues aren't bugs/dont effect anyone else, or you just get flat out banned without reason.  Oh and don't expect the issues to be patched out as they've announced they're already working on the sequel which even though they sold over a million copies of pCars 1, is going to be crowdfunded yet again.
3197	0	a	ENGLISH;  I hyped this game like I never did others I waited this game so long that sometimes I forgot that it will come out one day.  I expected a realistic drive. I got a simcade one.  I expected a developer who won't spam DLCs from day 1. We already have 8 DLCs after 6 months. They are already surpassed the price of main game combined.  I'd recommend this game but I won't.  Why?  I HATE DLC SPAMS.  TÜRKÇE;  Oyunu yıllarca bekledik bekledik durduk. Hatta kimi zaman oyunun çıkacağını / yapım aşamasında olduğunu bile unuttuk. Bu oyunu çok destekledim gerek forumlarda gerek arkadaş çevremde. PC platformu için böyle bir oyunun , FORZA ve GT ile yarışması için gerekli olduğunu düşünüyordum. Oyun genel olarak NFS : Shift 3 diyebiliriz. Az daha dayanabilir bir fizik motoru ve oynanış sunuyor.  Normal şartlarda oyunu tavsiye ederdim. Çünkü şu anda Assetto Corsa'dan başka rakibi yok. Ancak tavsiye etmememin sebebi kesinlikle indirilebilir içeriklerin çok hızlı ve fazlaca çıkması. 6 ay gibi bir süreç geçmesine rağmen 8 tane paket geldi. Bu paketler tabiki güzel ancak bu kadar yıldır geliştirilmiş bir oyunun içinde bazı ekollerin ve ikon arabaların olmaması bence çok komik bir durum. İşte tam bu noktada bence oyun yapımcısının daha sonra indirilebilir içerik olarak satmayı göze alması yatıyor. Zaten 2015 Mayıs ayında çıkan bir oyunu 2015 Haziran ayında %40-50 indirime çekiyorsun ondan sonra insanları tahrik etmek için ayda birden fazla indirilebilir içerik çıkartıyorsun. Şu anda 8 paketin toplam fiyatı çok rahat bir şekilde oyun fiyatına yetişiyor. Yani bir oyun parasıda ekstradan sahip olmak istediğiniz 3-5 arabaya veriyorsunuz.  Oyunu tavsiye etmeme sebebim budur. Yoksa oyunla ilgili ne grafiksel bir sıkıntı , ne optimizasyonsal bir problem veyahut ne de motorsal bir sıkıntı yaşamadım.  İndirimdeyse alın ancak onun dışında sakına tam fiyattan satın almayın. Benim gibi araçlardan hoşlanan biriyseniz alamadığınız her paket , her araç size kötü hissiyatlar yaşatacaktır.
3198	0	a	I want to recommend this game because some of the cars feel amazing, the tracks are beautiful, and occasionally you get an amazing online race.   The content, however, is lacking. Career mode(single player) is entirely inconsequential with no unlocks, money, or achievement. This makes it go stale quickly(for a gran turismo fan like myself).   Where it goes worse is the online races(which are arguably the main reason to get this game). In Pacific Standard Time there are about 15 - 50 players online at a time spread across multiple lobbies. Finding a good race takes a lot of time investment, only for a bunch of turn one wrecks by dive bombers and rammers. It's rare that a race actually goes cleanly and well(though so satisfying when it does). It's the low player count that hinders it the most.  *This being said... I do enjoy how most of the cars feel(especially the Mclaren mp4-12c GT3 car) and have had some EPIC races, but the experience is very inconsistent
3199	0	a	The value of the game and the price tag are like Sun and Moon. The engine sounds all sound the same for respective engine sizes, and cars are *nearly* uncustomizable save for preset appearances. The menus and structure of the game are very shoddy, every time I load the game I have to re-set my control presets, as it is nearly impossible to play without some form of controller. It seems to me that they put way too much effort into making it look graphically realistic, and they accomplished that, but other areas of the game are simply not up to par at all. I still play it just to rip around California highway 1, and there is a decent selection of cars, but alot of them are underwhelming, and beg the question 'Why is this car even in the game?'. I would not recommend this game to anyone as there are other games that do the same job better at lower prices, but it is a little bit fun at least.
3200	0	a	I provide an in-depth review of ‪‎Project Cars‬   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5484yaJtQ8 
3201	0	a	I am pretty dissapointed I remember playing the beta on someones computer and the physics were incredible, the driving was fun. This final version the driving is stiff and hard to handle. The physics are stiff, its like the cars are marbles and just bounce off everyone like an arcade sega game. I am not sure what changed this so much but not very happy at all.
3202	0	a	Lags a lot especially in multiplayer and 3rd person cam and in a racing game that shouldnt happen. Defenettly regret wasting my money on this.
3203	0	a	No support fort he T80.
3204	0	a	I was so excited for this game but I am disappointed by Steam and Project Cars. Experienced the game crashing after completing events and a multitude of bugs and issues. The career mode is buggy. I signed to a kart racing team but I end up racing Porches and forced only to race certain events? Even starting a career involved me leaving the game and tracking down a message board to find the steps to even begin the career mode.   Multiplayer is full of children to just want to drag race each other or crash me out. The servers are almost all empty except for the children messing around. I was promised a real racing game and ended up with a buggy game I dont want to play. I tried for a refund but since I was passed the 2 hour limit (way too short to find bugs and issues with multiplayer, come the f@#ck on). I understand it was my job to know the limits of the refund policy.   So.. Im stuck with a game I dont want to play and a lesson learned from Steam (vote with your dollars and choose a better platform). It will be a very long time before I come back to buy another game from this publisher and steam.
3205	0	a	Bought this game while it was on sale for $30 to try it out and ended up refunding it.  This game has the potential to be a great game but there are so many areas that need improvement. For starters, everything you hear about the AI being terrible is true. They drive as if you car is not there. Overtake someone going into a corner? Be prepared to get launched into space at corner exit by an AI. In addition, the crash physics are ridiculous. One little tap and off you go flying into the barrier. Lastly, there are graphical glitches that make the cockpit cam of some cars almost unusable.   The car selection is also lacking considering the wide variety offered by other racing games on the market. At the end of the day, Project Cars has a lot of potential but unless the game becomes polished and the AI fixed, it simply isn't worth the money.
3206	0	a	This game sucks. It won't work with my Logitech Rumblepad - tried for 3 hours to get it working and it crashse cars on any difficult corner. Steam won't refund my cost!! ♥♥♥♥ you ashhholes I won't buy another Steam product again.
3207	0	a	While the graphics are superb, the vehicle content and track selection is rather limited.  There are no Japanese cars available but 3 or so in separate paid content. Suzuka circuit doesn't exist because the rights weren't obtained, so it's instead a made up circuit called Sakkito.  This game isn't worth the full price I paid, but perhaps it is worth the $19.99 you can get it on discount for. Heck I just bought it last week so definitely not feeling I got my money's worth.
3208	0	a	If you are a former forza motorsport player and want to buy this game cus its a simulator and blablabla, just don't do it.

Also if you hit some dirt with can drag your car all the way into it with extreme force, even if you use full steering locking in the other dircetion. And finally if you hit a bump at high speed you seem to go flying even though aerodynamics (especially with the high end cars) should hold you to the ground. Other than that I think they have got something going here just needs these things sort especially the dirt problem then I would recommend this to others.
3210	0	a	Even after Patch 5.0 it is unfinished.  Carreer mode is dull. The AI is extremely bad - even after 5 patches they just ram people off. And once you are in front they cant keep a good speed even at maximum difficulty.   Game looks good. But that is not a reason to give it a positive review.  The tires still heat unnormally because they are not simulated. They do an overhaul now, but when you promise realistic tires then you better not only come up with that in patch 6.0.
3211	0	a	do you like CARS? Do you like CAR games where you drive CARS with other CAR drivers and do CAR racing wth them, in CARS? Well maybe you should try Project CARS then.
3212	0	a	Graphics excelent  Gameplay yawn  Content what ?
3213	0	a	Up to patch 3.0 now. 3.0. Still drops frames / hangs for 2s. Well done.
3214	0	a	I regret buying this so much :( The game crashes every 20 Minutes without any error message, eventhough my pc meets the requirements. The graphics, the tracks,the cars and the sound is nice, but the career sucks, no motivation at all. The menu is way to overloaded in my opinion. I tried to play it online, but for me it was unplayable, sometimes you just crashed into other cars, which werent even visible just a second ago...bugs everywhere. I won't recommend this game.
3215	0	a	Promised a lot, delivered just a bit, including tons of bugs. Features from the beta moved to the next game (Project Cars 2) wich was announced right when this one was released is a no-go. I was looking forward to historic tracks but most of them got cancelled and moved to the next game. Same for a custom championship editor and oval tracks.
3216	0	a	I can't recommend this anymore, it just became far too frustrating to enjoy thoroughly. You'll basically spend most of your time resetting events because the AI drivers are more skilled at demolition derbys.  I really wanted this game to get better. More variations in classes and performance tuning would be key. Knowing that's not likely to happen just scraps all reason to continue playing as the progression is pointless. Why bother when you get the same thrills from a non-career race such as practice or quick race?  The game does have its high points in sound and visual presentation, the enjoyment is just a little dry.
3217	0	a	I feel like i have been ripped off with this game it worked ok at first but now it has not been working for weeks it just keeps saying every time you try to load it unhandled exception. code oxc06d007f at ox89051f28 thread build smsari.20160512.1235.bldaooo. and i have looked at the forums and thereis lots of post about this. but no fix.
3218	0	a	Bought this game, played 1 race, went to change track, game crashed, steam wouldn't launch, restarted, hard drive now doesn't work. Would not recommend.
3219	0	a	Guided, tested, and approved by a passionate community of WMD members and real-life drivers who are paid to say good things, Project CARS represents the next-generation of racing simulation as the ultimate combination of WMD fan boys and developer arrogance/rudeness.  Discover an unrivaled immersion fuelled by above average graphics and simcade handling that allows you to truly not feel the road. Create a driver which is your name pulled off steam, pick from a huge variety of motorsports in a simplistic career mode and write your own tale in empty or crash-fest online multiplayer.  Featuring the largest track roster of any recent racing game giving quantity over quality with a scripted time of day &amp; weather system, buggy tuning &amp; pit stop functionality with terrible UI, and no support for 3 screens or current version of Oculus Rift, Project CARS trails the competition in their dust. 
3220	0	a	5 hours in and the game has crashed over 10 times now.. is that how games are released in 2015?
3221	0	a	Unless you belong to a group of elitist pc racers good luck finding a race. Most races are password protected and the ones that are not have like three poeple in them. Not to mention there is NO PROGRESSION in this game at all. It was really really boring for me to see all cars unlocked from the start. Everyone literally races the same car every single time. Look the game w as released a few months ago and is already 40% off. Whats that tell ya lmfao.
3222	0	a	dont even think to buy PROJECT BUGS because after 1 hour to playing online you got ♥♥♥♥♥♥ !. they dont want to update this game anymore they think about project cars 2. this game is full of bugs here is some examples on pc : 1. game freeze for 0.5 sec every ♥♥♥♥ing time when someone join/disconnect to/from server. 2. you cant join some servers because join button dont work on some servers. 3. another bug when your wheel dont even work so you need to restart game and then its work. and lot of other bugs . its only good to play offline !!!!! ♥♥♥♥ my english.
3223	0	a	Look this game is awesome and i mostly only play online. But honestly the online is that laggy and so many glitches and my the game keeps crshing every time online nearly. Its making it near impossible for me to play Project Cars anymore. Please Slightly mad studios! Can you please fix all the bugs in the game
3224	0	a	It's been four months since release, and nearly a half decade since development began and this game is still not in an entirely playable state. Pit glitches make endurance racing impossible, career glitches prevent advancement despite dominating the respective class, broken AI laptimes, bizarre physics glitches, and most egregious of all my T300RS is less playable with each update. The only decent thing about this game is the graphics engine which is very well optimized for nVidia cards. I've struggled to derive any enjoyment from this glorified beta and SMS's priorities and conduct instill zero confidence. I regret spending $50 on this at release, and wouldn't recommend it at any price over $15.
3225	0	a	This game claims to be a sim, yet the Ai are nothing but rammers, they will ram into to stay on the racing line and if they crash into will keep you pinned onto a wall just because they think its the racing line.   This game is only fun if you are doing time trails or get ahead and stay ahead.
3226	0	a	!!!ITS NOW 29,99 AND STILL THE SAME ♥♥♥♥!!!  Finally we have - Cheater's . Thnx guys -.- .   and its not a sim look at the times on every track u have a 1minute or more faster lap then the world fastest records ,and im not a great driver but Nürburg in 5min58seconds hmmm . and bugs yes many .   G27 users have issues and get banned for complening . WOW  cant recommend it to the sim racers . cant recommend it at all money hungry company that made 100times more money then they investet and still put out a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ buggy wanabie sim. with every month new dlc's :) Thnx guys .    sry for my english its horrible :)
3227	0	a	Cool graphics, shame the rest of the game sucks and is riddled with bugs that they cant be arsed to fix but instead bring out more DLC.  My ferrari thrust master wheel wont calibrate with this game yet the same model which has vibration  works...why?  Ive been in the forums asking why they cant fix this and nothing, Nearly 2016 and for a driving game this is lazy as my wheel works with all my other driving games.   Like i said nice graphics but in no way is this a simulation, even stock car extreme is better then this and thats a small brazilian company. Not the worst game in the world but seriously guys come on, its not as good as people make out.  6/10
3228	0	a	DO NOT BUY !!!  BUG NOT FIX SINCE GAME LUNCH . Accelaration dosent work when trying to play online.( race starts and you just cant do nothing .. you just stay there) Game creaters made there money and they just dont care anymore ( nothing is behing updated ) this game would be great be the creaters just dont care .. sad to see such a waste .
3229	0	a	Good racing game. Graphics are good. Pity about the AI in the game. AI seem to be a bit blind and race very 'aggressively ' and tend to shunt you out the way. Bit dumb. Is it worth the price at this moment? No. Its not for the hard core race gamer. It is however good for a laugh and some fun. I was hoping for a bit more technical and indepth play. Unfortunately not. AI spoil the game, and the lack of any 'modification' leaves the game a bit empty. You just race, thats all. Maybe best to wait for price to drop.
3230	0	a	This game is broken, deeply broken and I do not think it will be fixed. There are issues from menu bugs all the way to physics bugs that make this almost unplayable. Issues like rain tires being faster on a dry track than dry tires, or issues where the setup menu offers a certain compound of tire and then the pitstop menu simply has, 'Hard, Medium and Soft.' There are also some very odd psychic behaviors especially with the cars over bumps. Some of the cars are undriveable, look up the McLaren F1. Unfortunately it took me several hours of gameplay, frustration and then googling to realize that it wasn’t me, it wasn’t the learning curve, simply the game is bad. The studio has said it’s reached, “the end of development with this title, but they clearly never begun. It’s embarrassing, it’s worse than a Beta version and it’s pathetic it’s being allowed for sales.  Bottom Line: I was very excited about this game, totally sold on the hype and I feel ripped off. Thankfully I bought it on sale, but don't make the same mistake I did, stay away! Unfortunately, by the time I realized just how horrible this game was, I was well past the number of play hours allowed by Steam and was refused a refund. I still want my money back!
3231	0	a	THIS IS THE WORST GAME EVER...  As a player of forza 2 3 and 4 and also Gran Turismo 1 2 3 and 4 I can tell you that this is the  WORST  out of any racing game I have ever played. Bought this off of ♥♥♥ for $30 and even at that price i feel scammed.    PROS  - Well... um... There's lots of tracks and cars i guess.   CONS  - Physics are terrible, clip the curb of an apex and the next thing you know your kissing a wall. The grass spins you out way to much. Driving a stock Renault Clio turns into driving a Formula drift car over ice covered in butter.  - Graphics are WAY to beefy. People are saying this game sucks because its optimized for NVIDIA graphics cards, I have a NVIDIA graphics card, and a decent computer, but running this game on all of the lowest settings is a challenge.  - The GUI and menus DO NOT ALWAYS SUPPORT CONTROLLERS. I'm using an Xbox controller but in most menus you have to use the keyboard or mouse to use, which is a hastle for me because i like to sit far away when playing racing games.  - All of the cars are too clutchy, a little flick of the joystick sends you into a 180, and there's no way to fix the sensitivity.  - Tapping the brakes DOESN'T WORK, you either give it the beans our come to a complete stop. If you tap the brakes you get an EASY spinout which will cost you the race.  - Penalties. Get bumped off the track in qualifying because of one or all of the control issues in this game? Good news! Your next 2 lap times dont count! took me 15 minutes to quallify 4th to last.   - Go Karts. Are they really necessary? The brakes are so sensitive that even a little bit of braking stops t he kart immediately. Plus they unreallistically rev really slowly after stopping, so every time you use the brakes, you're looking at a good half second off your time.  I haven't even gotten to use the multiplayer because this game is si bad in single player. Too bad you can't get your money back.  
3232	0	a	Its a good game, if only the devs were not ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ cunt ♥♥♥♥♥
3233	0	a	It's not a bad game, it runs superbly well on my machine. 4th gen i7 @4.2ghz, 16gb RAM and a GTX970. The AI is irriating, stupid and unrealistic. Online works well if you have some friends that drive properly, most lobbys have at least 2 fools who think it's fun to play dodgems.   Graphically the game is lovely, love the fact you can have 40+ multiclass cars on the track. The sounds of the cars is not bad at all, engine notes are captured very well but tyre noises aren't that realistic at least from experience of being in the drivers seat. The single player career mode is a nice idea but annoying you can't skip the races you aren't interested in unless you start higher up the ladder but then you miss out of some of he earlier fun ones.  I love driving/racing games but somehow I just can't get into this one, and I can't really explain why.
3234	0	a	Hmm. What a mixed bag this is.   As far as physics go: this is not the best simulation. It's ok, sort of a Forza style representation. Slip angles are extremely forgiving. Slides are quite eaily recoverable. Understeer is more prominent than oversteer, though both are fairly minimal.  Force feedback with a wheel: lacking. Even if you spend hours and hours tuning and tweaking the force feedback (which you WILL), you won't get as immersive an experience as rFactor 2, iRacing or Assetto Corsa. It feels numb, lacking in representative feel relating to what you see on screen, and sterilized. There's also an extremely heavy centering spring that you'll have to spend lots of time tweaking to get where you want, but it still won't be great. This is my biggest dissapointment with the game.  Graphics: These are pleasing, but they aren't as amazing as they're made out to be. On par or slightly ahead of Assetto Corsa is my best description. There's tons out there on the graphics in this game. Tone you hype back a notch or two and that'll get you a relatively good expectation level for the reality of them.  Audio: Nothing particularly stands out. It's sufficient.  Gameplay: The career mode is underwhelming. I enjoy that its all about the racing, but I find it lacking depth via no differences between the teams you sign for and an obfuscated progression between series. IE: There's no real clear goals to achieve in order to attract a team from a particular series you want to progress to. There's some big and obvious flaws there I'm extremely surprised the developers didn't seem to notice. The one thing they get right is track and car selection. It's very diverse and populated. Easily PCars' best attribute.  Other: The UI is annoying. It's pretty but when it comes to using it, there are many places of frustration. For example, only being able to change FFB settings in the main menu options. So you have this thing that takes a ton of initial setup work (yes, even after the updates), and the only way to change the (many many, too many really) settings is through the main menu. Yet, the only way you can test those changes is in game. So the end result is the user spends hours and hours tweaking in the main menu, booting up a session, quitting the session to get to the main menu, changing things in main menu, booting up a session, etc, etc. It's one of the dumbest things in the game without a doubt. Choosing a car skin is similarly annoying as well.  Overall, the game is a struggle. That's the best way to describe it. It has a, on the surface, career type I want. However it doesn't excecute it well. The physics are *ok* but not very good and definitely not up to par wih its competition. The force feedback is a quagmire of disappointment. The visuals are nice but not nearly as pretty as advertised or hyped up to be. And there are a myriad of annoyances throughout the experience from UI design to choosing a car skin. The one and major saving grace for this game is its extensive car and track list. I won't go over the PCars 2 drama and what that may or may not entail. Nor will I go over the development drama of this game. However, as an owner of this game, I really hope Slightly Mad Studios keeps working on this title. It still has potential, but at this point is more of a Beta release than anything.
3235	0	a	they just a gruup of guys that took your money to make a game you dont see ppl who make call of duty takeing up money befor the release a game thats why they kep pushing it back and back .....now if you guys want to give me your money i can make a game to that is crap i got a i74790k ..32gigs ram two titans x sli ,,msi z97-g45 gameing bord and the game still look like crap
3236	0	a	Project of a cars game. Force feedback sucks really bad. Full of small bugs and bad design choices that should only be fixed in project cars 2. The AI turns into you, drives on grass and rain like on dry track. Real damage is crashing at 300km/h against a wall and having a minor suspension damage that can be fixed in 5 seconds in the pit.  no car control in the pits and you can drive throu cars that are going to the pit. Boring career and can't even setup a multi class race.
3237	0	a	Honestly doesn't feel finished...
3238	0	a	If your buying this JUST for VR, then DON'T!  JUST DONT!  Graphics are horrible, lighting is weird, frame rate dies, even on a 1070 and theres weird graphical flashing and stuff along the edge of objects.  So, game may be decent overall, but it's not well developed for VR. 
3239	0	a	You give us a game @ £40 quid then expect us to pay for downloadable content after your stupid remark about releasing project cars 2 WTF
3240	0	a	Fun game when it work. I have only been able to play online. I tried to play Career, but still nothing. Get stuck at the loading screen for the first race of career mode. And looks like plenty of other people are experiencing the same issue. I am running at 5760x1080 with 3 way sli 680s. Not sure if that has anything to do with it but ill leave that there.
3241	0	a	Graphically buggy and stutters. Analog controller is nearly impossible to play with. Can't adjust the controller settings while in game, so you have guess at an adjustment, load a race, try it, cancel race, go back into options, try again. Would consider tryign again some day when I have a nice wheel, but the graphical issues need to be resolved.
3242	0	a	The game needs more content i dont see why they dont have more of the popular well known car makes such as Ferarri, Lamborgini, Bugatti and Koenigsegg also the loading screens sometimes bug out so you have to restart the game however the game is ok overall hopefully they add the well known brands in the future... Also for some reason it dosent allow you to change cars when in an online game you have to exit to the menu just to change cars... I dont see why you cant its stupid!
3243	0	a	The game called Project Cars is the worst racing game I ever played. I'm a professional Kart driver and I started at my Carrer as a Kart driver. It's not like in real life! The force feedback and other things are not like in real life i guess you will definatly belive me. Don't buy this game!
3244	0	a	R.I.P. Project Cars 2
3245	0	a	This game just isn't very good. The money I put into this should have gone towards Dirt Rally or Assetto Corsa, so that's why I have so many hours. The AI ignores you, the Campaign is boring, and it really isn't a sim. The developer is a real jerk, too. They are now releasing a second game without finishing the first. It's sad, it had so much potential.
3246	0	a	When I first got the game I was quite excited. You see, I bought into the hype. Mistake number one. Mistake number two was spending money on this.  One minute it is Ok, the next it is horrendous. One car sticks to the road like it's glued on, and the next, a pure race car is like driving on some kind of super slick polymer. Almost all cars feel utterly disconected from the track. Random sounds thrown in to simulate what, I don't really know. Gave it a go and tried playing career, but when you have rain tires on in the rain and the slightest input of any kind and your car is off the track or into the wall or going backwards. All the while the AI is driving around as if it were on slicks in dry conditions.  Had one point where in the dry I actually had the fastest lap time until the last three seconds of practice when BOOM, an AI driver beat me by a mere twenty six seconds putting me at number two.  What a joke these guys played on the consumer. Next go around they will not get my money. I will give it to Polyphony Digital. Grand Turismo may be a little numb on occasion, and they may still have AI issues next time around, but at least it is not one big, unfinished, riddled with bugs, lie to the consumer. The saddest part about games like this is that the people that make them are utterly shameless about putting out trash.

3248	0	a	well i have to say this game has quite good graphics but the problem is that the car choices is too few,have you ever seen a racing game with no lambo and ferrari? and also the damage system is so unrealistic the glasses can be scratched but it cant be broken . There is alot of bugs , i crashed ,the following car crashed into my car , it said i hit opponent and disqualified me.....
3249	0	a	Stupid game that feels like it was rushed to the market, considering getting a refund but sadly steam's refund system is such that I wont be able to buy assetto corsa to replace this ♥♥♥♥ because funds take 7 days to clear.
3250	0	a	Good luck surviving the green light chaos. Oh and also good luck overtaking the AI on tight spot. :)  [TL:DR]  Update After Patch 2.5: I've changed the review to not recommended. I do really know this game has an astounding graphics, vast choice of cars. But what makes me change my mind is the support from the developer, the community, and the bugs that's still not fixed up till now. The pCars Head Developer is not even trying his best to help the people that has issue with the game (see the top review for the proof about his attitude towards his customer). Well, no comment about his attitude anyway, as long as he's still working on it.  The issues I'm dealing right now is that when I start the game, the SMS's logo pops up and it stays the same for a long time. When I try to click, the game crashes, and Steam says that I'm still in the game. So I have to restart my PC again. I have reported the issue but that Ian Bell doesn't want to help me. Instead he makes fun of me, tho' I have delivered it with the most polite way I have done. Take a look at this  http://forum.projectcarsgame.com/showthread.php?32776-Project-CARS-All-Platforms-Patch-2-0-Release-notes-OUT-NOW-on-PC-PS4-and-XB1&amp;p=1025173#post1025173   Conclusion: Not even worth a penny if you want the best service from a developer. Go get Assetto Corsa. Or get it when it's on 75% sale and up
3251	0	a	What's to say about Project Cars? I honestly can't put my finger on it. It claims to be a sim but it sure doesn't feel like that to me. Driving physics feel 'wrong' after playing Assetto Corsa for well over 200 hours with a G25 and TH8R shifter. The cars I've driven so far feel clunky, even when the settings are set to realism. There is no sense of speed when you go over the track at 250 km/h and still feel as if you're going 100 km/h.   The list of cars is also a bit disappointing. There is, however, a huge list of tracks, featuring some of my favorite like Spa, Nordschleife and BRNO.   Project Cars isn't a bad game but the physics and the way the cars handle still make it feel rather arcade than a sim. Do I recommend this game? I'd say no, not if you want a full bred race simulator.
3252	0	a	I mean... This game has everything. Yet I don't like it. I bought this, Corsa, and Dirt Rally at the same time. I've tried my best to get into Project Cars and on paper I should love it but I hate the way the game feels. It has A LOT, but masters nothing. Lots of cars, lots of graphic effects, lots of settings, lots of tracks but none of it feels right. Maybe it's good with VR?  I love Corsa, Dirt Rally, Forza 3, even F1 2016 (so far). They are all very specific games, but this game tries to do it all and it never feels rememberable or intense.
3253	0	a	pCars fits into a weird section of the sim-racing market. It's beautiful graphics and nicely designed cars &amp; tracks puts it well above many of the racing games currently, yet its sounds and physics trim it down to a 'simcade' type of game.  The content is widely spread with lots of cars to choose from &amp; appropiate AI cars to race with making the races less generic. Whilst I have not yet completed the career mode, it does seem like quite a grind (from Karting to LMP1) which is probably something I will not persue, but at least there is enough content to make someone who enjoys the game to get the most out of it.   The AI itself are rather tricky, I found myself constantly switching the AI percentage to try and make it fit how I wanted it for each track (which is far from ideal) yet still couldnt find the sweetspot that i get from RF2 every single time I head out onto the track.  My best advice would be pick it up if Graphics are a bit 'thing' for you on sale, but if you like a hardcore sim title- this isnt for you. Similar to F1 2016 in that respect, perfect for a quick drive every now and then, not something I could delve my time into unfortunately.
3254	0	a	The game itself is quite OK with a convincing driving experience. The developer, however, is an absolute no-go. They have announce a SteamOS/Linux version of the game and then silently cancelled it. Do not make the mistake to support them. There are other alternatives of honest developers (who have either actually released versions for other platforms or never announced such versions).
3255	0	a	waste of money,,,,same as grid autosport but with worse graphics,,,
3256	0	a	Pros: Graphics Easy to drive  Cons: Car settings are pretty messed up. I had to tune every car one by one to drive properly.  Car sounds are very horrible.   I guess it's due to putting many cars into one game. The most car settings are the same. The worst thing is that steering ratio is not simulated properly.  As a race simulator, I don't recommend this game, but if you like an arcade race game, it would be a good choice. I don't like this game personally
3257	0	a	Bought this game thinking it would be great for the Vive, I had played Elite Dangerous a lot and know how fun an immersive cockpit style game can be in VR, So naturally i just assumed it would be really fun to get the same experiance from a racing/car style game. All of the positive reviews had me going.  So lets get just dive into the point real quickly, I will look passed the fact that the game its self is very bland, Most Simulation games can be, And the fact that the AI is pretty well dumb?  But if you are buying this for VR be prepared to get some pretty intense lag from time to time.   My Specs are.  EVGA GTX 980 Classified Edition 6700k i7 processor 4.0ghz 32gb Corsair Dominator Platinum Ram 512gb SSD Liquid Cooling EVGA SuperNOVA 1600 PSU  You get the idea, I have a pretty heafty pc that should be more than capable of running this game let alone VR, Yet i still get Vive frame rate loss on a lot of the maps unless i go into 3rd person mode which sorta defeats the purpose of the vive. I am not the only person having this issue i have talked to a few people claiming they had the same problem.  Until they get the frame lag issue sorted out for VR i would not buy this unless you are just playing it on a regular monitor.

3259	0	a	When it's been out of early access this long and it still doesn't show the lap times correctly...  This is like a reskinned Shift2 Unleashed, maybe with a few different cars or routes, but the driving feel to me is the same. Forget the marketing on physics in PCars, you'll still hit invisible walls and obstacles on the track that will stop your car dead.  You can race your friends in this, yes the matchmaking is easy with steamworks integration, but forget about being competitive. Why? Because the lap times don't show up properly at the end of each race. But don't worry, the devs made a GOTY version so you can have all the DLC and forget about game breaking bugs like proper lap time recording in a crowdfunded racing game. /s
3260	0	a	Force feedback is garbage.
3261	0	a	This is not a finished game.  Gameplay is good, but there are too many bugs. Not long ago there was a bug that every time you went to a pit stop, you'd get flat tires when you got back on the track, now when I triy to enter a pit stop, the car doesn't stop, it just continues rolling into the pit stop, and crashing it's way back out while I'm in the pit stop menu.
3262	0	a	Wasted potential and broken promises. Guess what... SMS...will make PC2 so you could loose all your money again!
3263	0	a	Unfortunately for me, this game is a huge disappointment and a waste of money. Unfinished. It looks like done on his knee. Hopeless menu. Compared to its main rival Asseto Corsa falls at least slightly. Honestly I prefer to play in the old Shift 2 than in it. :(
3264	0	a	I'd normally write a longer review than this, but I just can't be bothered. I'll simply say that the game just isn't all that good and the biggest let down is the AI... It's fine for multiplayer, in fact it's very good for racing against friends, but if you want a good racing game with an in-depth and accurate career mode, challenging AI and accurate race weekend simulation, look elsewhere.
3265	0	a	Oversteer in a FWD car.. Nope, try again Slightly Mad Studios.   Track and Car Selection are fantastic, but driving model doesn't make sense. The game is hard, not because its difficult, but because the car handling is completely wrong, Assetto, Iracing, hell even Grand Theft Auto's racing is better than this. (lol) Why would they add the Radbull if there's no car control? Snap oversteer is real. Oh well.
3266	0	a	I was hyped for this game for so long before it was released but now I am very disappointed. First of all, it's not about cars, it's about motorsports. It's not a game like Gran Turismo, Forza or even Real Racing. Interface is very unintuitive, AI is bad and there is no real goal if you don't set it by yourself. Graphics and audio are superior but if you want just to see nice cars, better go out.
3267	0	a	Graphics are far from what was promised (driveclub is in a totally different galaxy for example) and the game is totally bland/boring (except maybe if you like real - boring - tracks seen on...well every racing games since 20 years...)
3268	0	a	I have played this game for many hours and I really want to say that it's a game that i would recommend to my friends, but, with the way they treat people in the forums and how no real improvements or promises have been fulfilled, I cannot with a clear conscience. I have lower end equipment, true, but it is above minimum specs required for the game and I have less than 60 FPS with all settings to low. And if it rains....forget it. Some tracks are better than others and if the frameraate was consistent even being less than 60 i would be happy. It simply is not very optimized for most if not any computer. So with all the beautiful graphics and they really are, if you cant play it at a consistent FPS it is not worth the money. And as I have said before the way the studio head belittles his customers and the banning of any one who dare point out a legitimate bug is banned and ostracized i would not recommend supporting this studio in this game or any other that has the SMS and WMD logo.  EDIT: I have recently majorly upgraded my equipment, 16GB DDR4 2133MhZ RAM: Zotac GTX970 Graphics Card; icore 5 6500 3.2Ghz 3.6 Turbo Processor; Its a beast now, and I still wouldnt recommend this title becuse of the poor treatment of customers and players who are still upset from the empty promises that have not been fulfilled and the poor A.I. and many other problems that still plague this title. I will admit, it is beautiful and really could be a must have tiutle, but , its not at this juncture and dont think it will ever be. I think they have pretty much given up on any more 'fixing' of the game and the fanboys will say they still have a large team dedicated to this title. But the truth is they have a team dedicated to cranking out DLC not fixing the game.
3269	0	a	After quite a few hours in game I have to recommend not to buy this game.  There are numerous glaring errors in game that even after two weeks after release have not been patched.  Straight up bugs:     2 out of 3 times Setups are not saved (e.g. changing the gear ratios before the race will sometimes not be reflected in game)    Many of the default setups are plain broken (e.g. in career mode the BMW M1 Procar has the same gear ratios for 2nd and 3rd gear on some tracks)    Game sometimes crashes/hangs during pit stops    AI will crash during pit stops blocking everything making other drivers unable to use the pits    On some tracks some of the curbs are not existent but only textures. Driving on them will not make a difference to normal road (e.g. Donnington, Spa and others)    No collision detection during pit stops, leading to other cars driving through you when rejoining or entering the pits   Some of the HUD Elements bug out (e.g. the 'predictive' timer)   Missing things I consider important for a game marketed as 'the next-generation of racing simulation':    Handling is rather simplistic. Weight transfers are barely present, the car feels lifeless (although I have to say that there are quality differences between cars...still none of them feels good. All assists off btw.)    ForceFeedback is not up to par with other sims like Game Stock Car Extreme etc. Even after spending almost two afternoons tweaking there is just no really good feeling.    Not possible to share setups with friends    Could not find a way to have multiple setups per track (only 1 for each training, qualifying, race)      Things that are just not good:     The AI is atrocious. Divebombing like crazy, ramming like the best of them...sometimes it feels like racing on a public multiplayer server   The AI only seems to be aware of the player after being about half way alongside while overtaking. Driving alongside an AI car overlapping only about a third car length is a sure way to be rammed of the track.   On some tracks the AI seems not to be subject to the same physics calculations as the player. Clearly visible when following behind closely and watching turning behavior of the AI. Also when driving in rain or watching AI racing through sand/gravel without being affected. Also AI seems unaffected by cold tires...    Some of the tracks are just not very well modeled. Some of the corners of Spa are just wrong...the Nordschleife (a track I know from RL) is of laughable quality (Hatzenbach, Miss-Hit-Miss, Mutkurve just to name a few corners are really not well modeled)...in Barcelona the corner radii are off...    Pit stops are plain broken....tried to finish a 2 hour race multiple times to only be unable to pit because multiple AIs are stuck perpendicular to the pit straight accelerating into the divider.   The replay system is so limited it borders broken. Watching a second replay while driving will bug the replay controls out.   This game could be really good. I could overlook the very limited tire model and physics or the lackluster FFB, but all the bugs added to that make this a huge disappointment. And I have given it more than enough time to show its qualities.
3270	0	a	So I've not played that much (14h as you can see). I've focused on the 'career' mode. It's not a real career mode, more like 'drive those races and you can change the mode after you finished the season' and by mode I mean you can change between GT4 and Formula C and stuff. You kind of work your way up but you can also start in Formula A (the highest one) if you want.  So I like it for the fact that you get different race weekends with the whole practice and qualifying stuff which is based on the real regularitions (i guess).  But there are plenty of races you are 'forced' to drive wether you want to or not. So I'm in GT4 atm. and am forced to drive a Lotus cup. If you drive those compared to the GT4 it's like you put on a Speedhack and turned off the traction. If you accelerate to much you will turn around. You cannot even start straight if you've got full acceleration. Thats kind of annoying.  All those Karts and Formula cars I've tested seem so freaking unrealistic. I've been karting in real life and in this game it's just like a speedhack version of that. You cannot control anything. Well I can't.  Eitherway in career mode I've started with the Renault Clio (since Karts were not an option for me). Those feel like your steering a battleship. You're so slow and heavy.  After that I've been driving some GT5 car i forgot. That was better but felt pretty heavy, too.  The Aston Martin Vantage (GT4) is really fun to drive though. Atleast I like it. But it doesn't seem to be realistic in any way. You're like driving on rails compared to the Formula Cars. And that's what makes me wonder. Isn't it the other way round?  All in all I might not be the best informed racer on earth and I've not tested all the cars in this game but I can say it is partly fun but there are better games focusing on one part of what this game tries to combine.
3271	0	a	Not worth waiting 3-4 years for. The biggest let down in this game is actually audio. Granted, very few racing sims get this right, with the notable exception of Simbin - the sound experience in this game is downright unpleasant. Its supposed to make you want to turn UP the volume, not down - as is currently the case.  I suppose the game will look nice on an NVIDIA card - but I will never know. My HD7970 struggled to keep this at 60fps - but only after spending an hour tuning settings; At which point it looked no nicer than a stanard Xbox 360 game.   Dont believe the hype.   PS: Oh, and the menu UI is laughable.
3272	0	a	The game was fun when i first purchased it some months back. I recently started playing again and a patch or something must have been released because my xbox controller no longer works. If the controller is picked up by the game weird things happen during a race like the gears shifting one direction constantly making the game unplayable.  Maybe other people might be luckier then I and get the controller work. otherwise be warned that unless you like racing with a keyboard or have a steering wheel setup, you wont be able to play the game.
3273	0	a	Alt-F4 is disabled. On a game like this, the ability to quickly close it when the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI drives you to want to smash the monitor is essential, and in this case nonexistant. I don't get why games disable alt-F4. I know that if I alt-F4 the game won't have a chance to save, but I don't care / I don't want it to, hence I'm trying to alt-F4 out.  On to the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI then. Weather doesn't apply to them. Cold tyres don't apply to them. Blue flags don't apply to them. Cut track penalties don't apply to them. Your position on the god damn track doesn't apply to them and they attempt to drive straight through you EVERY TIME. Sure, you can get around this by setting the difficulty to 0 and lapping the ♥♥♥♥ out of them, but I want a challenge! I don't want to just tap them lightly and watch them drive off the track to give way - that's not a battle for 1st place! Neither do I want to have them completely ignore me and wind up taking us both out as I go for a pass and they decide to suicide themselves into me. No driver would do that!  Unlike others, I haven't encountered any blatant bugs yet. In fact gameplay wise the I think driving is very good. They have the game down, they just need to stop releasing quick cash grabbing car DLC packs and fix the damn AI.
3274	0	a	SORRY but should be renamed PROJECT CRAP :-(
3275	0	a	Don't buy this game. Current one underdelivers and new one is coming out, with Rally and Hillclimb. I refuse to support greedy devs who can't release a finished product. Buy Grid Rally if you want Rally racing, and not just tracks.
3276	0	a	I HAVENT SAW ANY GAME BEFORE BUGGED LIKE THIS ONE,THIS ISNT NORMAL..PLEASE GUYS DONT BUY THIS GAME!
3277	0	a	Terrible Framerates on AMD Video Cards. 
3278	0	a	Too much bugs Too much innacurate track Too much wannabe sim Too much fuss with setting that don't work Too much of waste time Too much unplayable  At least the car model look accurate with good graphic &amp; weather.... That's about it.
3279	0	a	Cool graphics, awful gameplay.   Edit: People online seem to be 'subhumans'. Be careful.
3280	0	a	I was very excited to get my hands on this and when a sale hit, i got it. I didn't really know what to expect...and i was let down.  The game feels unfinished. The sound is far from perfect and buggy, the physics are odd, especially for collisions. Visuals are pretty nice, that's a plus.  Setting up a controller is a chore, if it works at all. No profiles for that, if you happen to touch something have fun doing everything again. Settings are buggy in general.  There is a nice list of cars and tracks availabe, that's also pretty cool, but the sheer mass of content does not increase its quality. I'm sorry, but i would not recommend this game. If you're looking for a proper racing sim get Assetto Corsa or iRacing or rFactor2 or whatever, but not this. If you like to play around in a more arcade style game, go ahead, at a discounted price it sure can be worth it. I'm not going to talk about my feelings when i look at the list of DLC...
3281	0	a	this game is the poster child for pirating games before you buy them or why steam should offer refunds for games. This game is junk. mainly because It's not really a game. It is more of a simulator. I was looking for something to replace asphalt 8 and this looked like a good game, but after I actually got to play it was hyper realistic crap. the cars seem to have a 2 mile turn radius. I go to turn and it barely turns then slams into the wall. Such a waste of money
3282	0	a	hello  first of all before i say this, id like to say ive played this since its release, and almost every day ive played it on a number of tracks, both online and offline, so please dont lecture me, but this in why anyone thinking of buying this game, should turn around and run away...  i can understand that on release a game is not going to be perfect, lord knows rome 2 wasnt, and i can same the same for most games, however there is a line that has to be drawn, and the issues with Pcars..is that it should not have been released in the first place.   Let me explain - the cars and tracks are fine, thats not the issue, they feel fine, the speeds are realistic, even the weather and detail..is amazing, but...the one thing its needs to do most...its fails at miserably - driver input ....how many times do i have to enter a race, and have the car accelerate without my input, how many times do i have to be mid corner...and have the wheel go full lock to the right? how many times do i line up on the grid, and get a drive through penalty?? why do i enter the pits to change to wets, and come back out still with dry tyres on??!!! ... why was this game released...with those bugs in existence, those are game breaking bugs. the enthusiasts that trust the developers and look forward to 'real' feedback, have been betrayed and stamped on, and still after updates, the issue, the most important thing that makes racing fun, has not been fixed....ive just raced at le man for 2 hours...only for the car to snap randomly..due to the steering going.  now i know what your going to stay - 'your steering is wrong, its your fault not the games' but...i am not the only one ive spoken to that has this issues. and my wheel is perfectly fine in iRacing..GTR2..and others, so that..is just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  And just to give you the full truth...PCars 2 has been announced...and most the features, like driver swaps, safety cars, dynamic systems, have all been taken out of Pcars and put into Pcars 2!! so not only have i bought a game, where i dont get what i invested in, but the biggest part that annoys me...is that the developers..dont, give a dam   ive never read news, or seen anything that has had a positive impact on the way PCars feels, and the way it drives...and for a person that is a creator of a racing league, someone who love motorsport and racing ...i feel let down and dissapointed that people could turn their backs on the very people that made their company flourish....  I wont be playing until they fix this game, but its not like they will care, as they already have my money to invest in their next broken mess to be released in 10 years or so.   Ill stick with iRacing, a company that actually offers you a service, and delivers whats on the tin...  OverTheLine
3283	0	a	It is second to none when it comes to racing graphics. The AI can be quite competitive and is mostly great aside from when you're following two AI cars and dive on the inside or outside about to make a move and one will cut over to block (which is great) except that they always slow down drastically as well. For me this has happened frequently.  Also, when racing the go-karts there is no sense of immersion.  My biggest complaint is that you are only allowed one car setup per track. Even racing sims from over a decade ago can handle this. I'd recommend Assetto Corsa or rFactor 2; however the graphics in rFactor 2 are no better than the original rFactor.
3284	0	a	worked fine at launch but after 1st update all went wrong no FFB on the wheel (g27) ive played about with allsorts spent many hours tryin to sort it but once you sort 1 thing out somthing else wont work then .
3285	0	a	junk.  pit crew always choose wrong tyres headlights need new bulbs and need to point forward  cant adjust key bindings while in game playing with gamepad lacks feel and steering to quick on gamepad even at 0% voice on new events cant be skipped seat to far forwards no headlamps in mirrors 2/10 avoid
3286	0	a	Having played this game for close to 30hrs, I feel I have enough of a grasp of it's content to write a review. For reference, I come from a Gran Turismo background so a lot of my feedback will be based on that as a 'simulator' with the use of a wheel/pedal setup (My current setup is a Thrustmaster T500RS, TH8a Shifter &amp; T3PA PRO Pedals).  GRAPHICS - 8/10 This is easily the strong point for PCARS. I am fortunate to have a very good PC so play with mostly Ultra setting with some at high getting roughly 70-100fps. The detail within the cars is excellent with the environment and tracks being even better, a really good looking game. However I must note that even at the point of this review, there are still graphical glitches seen in open cockpit cars when it is/isn't raining.  INTERFACE/UI - 7/10 In one word I would say....simple. Everything is easy to find and straightforward. That being said, the 'career' segment is so basic and shallow it seems like an afterthought. WTF is that calendar system all about? Could the Devs not think of something more interesting/complex than a calendar?  Also pointless emails/'tweets' are pointless. WHY? I won 15ish races on the bounce and I still got emails from people saying '...this could be part of a streak'....??? Really? You think? Why do I care what Betty whatshername wrote about me on twitter clone-hashtag thingy? I don't!  PHYSICS - 6/10 This is where I start to see a downturn in PCARS. The physics attached to the cars are very good and definately worth the title of simulation, however the score I have given reflects the lack of positive impact changing the settings of any vehicle has on it's handling. I have tweaked the settings to try and improve charachteristics of the vehicle (Escort Mk1) but to no notable avail. It seems as though every car is set-up to be pretty darn competitive out-of-the-box to the point where there is no real reason to change anything, even though any positive changes seem unoticeable. Why have such an indepth choice of tweaks and settings to your car when it isn't really needed?? Also to note, crash physics between cars is below average at best (It feels more like you are playing bumper cars!).  AI - 5/10 Boring. Just plain boring. They are okay for casual racers that just need someone to race against in offline mode, but for people looking for a challenge just go and face real humans (....or try another game?). Apart from staying pretty rigid to the raceline, they do not seem to offer much of a challenge when trying to compete for podium places. I feel this is a problem area that almost the entire race genre has, probably owing to the challenge of coding such an AI. So in that regard PCARS is no different than most racer sims, which in of itself is dissapointing considering PCARS is meant to be the challenger to the race-sim crown.  FEATURES/DEPTH - 5/10 ...and quite frankly I feel I am being generous. You never *OWN* any of the cars within the game, you are purely a contract driver. As a concept this is fine, but it will naturally lead to a lack of depth in gameplay owing to the fact that you are simply a faceless dude that turns up around the world in a blink, races then jets back home (This is the main problem with PCARS). This is unlike in Gran Turismo/Forza Motorsport ect where you earn the money and put blood, sweat and tears into owning a piece of machinery. Then, carefully taking your underpowered Golf Gti and turning it into a FWD beast, you face the challenges with something that is YOURS. You earned it, raced it, improved it then won in it. The concept is rewarding and makes for improved length of gameplay and a vast array of features.  PCARS has none of that. You're a faceless grunt, deal with it.  CONCLUSION - 6/10 When I first learnt of PCARS I was HYPED. The idea was brilliant with a community focussed race-sim that delivered a Daddy of all racers that I could spend vast amounts of hours being a nerd while drooling over cars I will probably never own. However, I feel disappointment. It's very pretty yes, but it's so...so shallow. The 'Career' is pathetically boring at best alongside the AI that seem to be drafted from the deaf-dumb-polite society.  Disappointed.
3287	0	a	The game was very good for if you want to just race on race tracks and not have an open world to drive in, but it needs more cars that you can use on the road.  And there is no open world so you can run from the cops or anything. So the price is way too high since you race on certain maps and such without being able to have a open world.  The only great thing about this game is if you want to drive on race tracks realisticly(rain, dark, or shiny) then this is the game, but its only realistic if you have these special steering wheels and special brake and/or gas pedals.
3288	0	a	the cars in this game are to hard to control (even with all the setings set on there easy seting)
3289	0	a	the cars in this game are to hard to control (even with all the setings set on there easy seting)
3290	0	a	Having to pay 32€ for the upgrade to the GOTY Edition when I can get the GOTY itself for 35€ new, is a slap in the face of all the people who bought Project Cars on release and an absolute insolence. Definitely no Project Cars 2 for me.
3291	0	a	Tried it few months ago and performance in VR was terrible. Gave me motion sickness as well. I don't know if the devs have fixed it or not but I'm not willing to try again as Assetto Corsa is a way better alternative in terms of physics, performance, graphics and VR.
3292	0	a	A half arsed attempt at a racing sim,while project cars does something's right and offers a more robust front end and track and car line up than other pc racers it however fails in the most important departments when trying to be a driving game simulator or even an enjoyable arcade or casual driving game.  I hate the sound in this game,there are not enough options to balance the sound effects in the game,the slider doesn't work as intended and with most sounds down to 50% and car engine sound at 100% I can stil hear far too much road sound and other car sounds,on top of that there is an annoying tire sound heard when cornering the car at any degree that i also can't stand,it's as if the tires on your car are wrapped in sand paper and there is no variation in this sound what so ever from car to car or gegree of turning point,very generic sounding and it wont go away.The engine sounds themself i also dislike and this contradicts general thoughts that the sound quality of the cars is very good,i trialed 6 cars from the kart and fomula series to stock and road and they all sounded very furmilar,each had very similar gear ratio sets ups and all were very quick in gear changes,i couldn't get to hear a turbo kicking in as you throttle up second or third gear to the over rev point with any meaningful sense of speed,all the cars did were go up quick and over rev with no real improvement in speed,there were no backfires or engine haults,the engines all sounded a bit winy to me with no depth.  Controls while using a 360 controller were dreadful,very twitchy controls that sometimes seemed to lose control and traction on the road for no apparent reason,i found this strange and to be the case on only certain parts of a track too and feels more like a bug,i wonder if the wheel is also like this ?  I could never recommend this game,i am a little let down by it in all regards,graphics are nothing that new,sound quality is lacking mostly in deph,controls feel like a rehash of a game called need for speed shift unleashed with a similar feeling of twitchy floatyness and middle wobble,no sense of speed vs sound design.  A shame and i am glad i waited before buying and refunding.   I come from racing games like forza on console and race 07 on pc,race 07 is a far far superior game in almost every way to this pile of garbage,i highly recommend it ! and if you want the newer and possibly the best sim racer on pc i would recommend racingroom experience here on steam,the base game is free for all to play.
3293	0	a	its not opening
3294	0	a	Whenever I run the game it afterwards sets my Windows Sound scheme from No Sounds to Default. It is totally unacceptable to me that a game changes my system settings.   Also you can not set the race distance freely when using timed races. There are only fixed times forced upon you. So you can not run a lot of real life race distances. How hard can it be to make the time a freely selecatble minute setting?  When you use the AI co-driver and the weather changes he comes in to change tyres. So someone had half a brain. However you then have to be there and select the tyres the AI wants. Of course it does not tell you which tyres it wants. So if you give it tyres it does not like it comes straight in on the next lap again. Also it would do this on the final lap. So I take that back. Whoever programmed that has to be brainless because otherwise he would let the AI take the tyres it wants and then send it off again.   Also the track limit system is complete rubbish. The AI itself frequently violates it. AI cars pass you going completely off track and get no penalty. And also your AI co-driver misses the track limits frequently and then gets you disqualified.   Another problem is that the game just crashes after long races. I did two 12 hour races with it. Each time the game did not come back after the results screen and therefore the data was not added to my driver profile.   As much as I like a lot of the other things the game does I can absolutely not recommend it unless these most basic, glaring and unexcusable major bugs are fixed. It seems like nothing is tested or thought through at all with this game.
3295	0	a	Unable to remap my controls on my G27. SMS support is non existant. unable to play the game, they took over 3 weeks to get back to me, rendering me unable to get a refund  however, reports of major issues with the game, and they are working on Pcars2 before they have fixed many game breaking issues should show people that they are in it for $$$ and as long as they get $$$ they don't care about their customers.  Asseto Corsa is a much much better game!
3296	0	a	Its a good simulation game but its too expensive than its worth.. Here is my Review ..  Positive : -Immersive graphics -Focus on racing -Variety of tracks, cars and disciplines -Some Strong AI  Negative : -Controls require configuration -Bugs and glitches continue to appear -Bad carreer system -Very few car brands and also models.   I dont recommend this game .. Dont buy it .. its too expensive You will be disappointed..... Its not worth for that money.    
3297	0	a	The game is really overrated.Particle system is the ugliest i've ever seen in a new video game. Also i found the handling of the cars very odd. On top of all that the game is very boring: same old tracks from games like grid or need for speed. I'm just tired of the same locations like nurburgring and so on. Game lacks originality. I've payed 50% off but i am still feeling ripped off.
3298	0	a	This game feels like it is still in BETA and has too many bugs plus it is taking weeks/months for patches to be releases to fix these bugs.   Don't waste you money.
3299	0	a	This game is a race car driving simulater. NOT a racing game.  I was excited about this game. I love forza, dirt, and grid. I thought it was going to a combination of the best of all 3. It was, but it also wasn't.   The graphics are good. The amount of detail on the cars rival, if not surpass, forza. However the track and the environment suffer.   The AI in the game is okay. They follow their race line and thats that. The will not move. They will not try to take the outside to pass you they will try to go through you in order to pass.  The game play is great. Each car handles in its own way. You feel the difference between the BMW M1, the Zonda, and the go karts you start out with. It is wonderful and I give full credit to the developers who made it. It is a job well done.  My biggest problem is the shear lack of cars. No ferraris. No lambos. No Bugatti. No koenigsegg. No Volkswagon Golf. No Chevy Corvettes. Litterrally 3/4 of the cars you find in Forza alone are not in this game. They have very few normal cars for you and your friends to drunkely race. Few super/hyper cars that you can only dream of owning and want to top out. It is by far the biggest dissappointment. The cars that are availabe are race cars with few road cars availbe.   This game is supposed to make you feel like you are a young race car driver. It does and it does it well. I now realize this after I played the game for a bit. I also realize what I liked about forza and grid and dirt are not good for a game that wants to be as real world as possible when it come to making you feel like a acutal race car driver.   Grid, Forza, and Dirt are racing games. They look good, they feel good, they are focused on making the driving experience entertaining and fun. This game focuses on accurarcy above all else.   Again for the people who only read the first and last senteces of a review: This game is a race car driving simulater. NOT a racing game.
3300	0	a	Bought the game but if you want any new cars you must buy them. Huge waste of money! Yay another dlc rip off!
3301	0	a	Absolutly f*cking unplayable with every car spinning out all the time with ALL assists on and with the most stable tuning possible. Poor physics, dont listen to anyone who says this game is realistic. The graphics are good, but i had to use sweetfx to make the game look as it should in 2015.
3302	0	a	If you like Forza, you will hate this game. The driving is fine, but there's no cars. Forza has hundreds of cars from all makes and models.
3303	0	a	Well im dissapointed , it feels unfinished , short of content and im reluctant to stump up for extra content , handling is rubbish as soon as your car looses traction you cannot ride it out you will crash stuck in to the barrier and have to reverse out , crash detection is woefull , slightest clip and your in a lurid spin , some tracks have blind dips and as soon as you hit that your car goes light and you most likely again crash . AI is weak the lead car just sits behind you and the rest fade away , yep or you crashed and worked your way to second there is a big gap to first . the slow cars are decent to drive with more mechanical feel but supercars on fall apart at the first corner with the crash detection and the knife edge handling . i am using a 360 xbox controller , its working better in win 10 but pre update in win 7 i had no hope at all , no support for 360 controler unless it has been patched now i dont know . out of 10 i rate this unfinished game 4 . but if it were finished it has promise .
3304	0	a	AI are rediculous, first lap first corner crash kid everywhere. There's no way you could properly start a race outside pole. If you turn up the difficulty, the crash-kid-issue is just getting worse and worse.  Definitely a waste of money.  Oh, and the Nurburgring Norschliefe sucks. Nowhere near the real stuff in Germany. (I've drove there for quite a dozen laps these few years)
3305	0	a	Another game that didnt live up to the hype. Very frequent crashes, visuals looks aweful, laggy gameplay and lock ups. And now they announce Project cars 2. Seriously, they have not even sorted this one out yet. REFUND APPLIED FOR. I will NEVER buy another product off this very bad software developer. RIPP-OFF !!!!!!
3306	0	a	I don't get it, I've driven quite some fast cars very fast and they never felt so prone to loose control like in this game. I always start feeling disconnected with a game, when I e.g. choose a BMW M3 and the game has it performing like some average street car, except it isn't able to do 20° corners at 50 mph without troubles. So if i can't trust the sim with cars I've driven myself how should I trust it with the others... Maybe getting a 300€ steering wheel would be better than using a controller, but at this point I'm just to afraid my experience wouldn't be different if I would buy one.. Also great is the 'going into a corner at 20, hitting the grass with one tire, better spin completly' experience
3307	0	a	♥♥♥♥ game only cause the makers are all talk!! buy our game heaps of DLC and more to come... NO DLC AND THEY ANNOUNCE PART 2 INSTEAD!!
3308	0	a	If you like force feedback, DO NOT BUY out of the box the force feedback will rip the wheel straight from your hands. There is little in regards to help setting it up properly Each car has its own settings you will have to tweak to make it drive right ! 
3309	0	a	Riduculously unrealistic for a game that touts itself as a racing simulator. Garbage controls. Making driving artificially difficult doesnt make for a simulator. I shouldnt be losing traction at 30mph on a straightaway, yet in project cars that's what happens.   Refunded promptly.
3310	0	a	Should be renamed to Project Bugs. The game is not finished. It plays as it is still in beta stage.  The AI is the worst I have ever seen in a racing game, they will crash into you any chance they get. 
3311	0	a	I really tried to like this game and put many hours into it but I just can't stand playing it anymore.  There are so many problems with this game. AI divebombing you when they pit. AI driving on grass as if it was fully rubbered in asphalt, AI constantly smashing into the back of you when you brake. Screwed up tire model where I can drive with wet tires for a whole race on a dry track without them melting (tire wear was enabled in options). AI not yielding when you go to lap them, resulting in more crashes.  This game should have been in development much longer. PBugs is an appropriate title.
3312	0	a	Not fun at all. 1/10  Playing the game on triple screen and Logitech G25. Force feedback just sucks, game has no fun or realistic feeling. Feels more like GTA than a racing sim. Graphics are odd. Game is not built with triple screen in mind, unlike Asseto Corsa. Vehicle and track selection is the only good thing I can say about the game. Probably can somehow be fixed with setting change but the menus are horrific, Takes too much time to understand what each setting mean. Spent more time in the settings section than in racing and still no good outcome.  Can't believe I've waited for this and spent more than 5$ on this.  Good bye and welcome back, Asseto Corsa.
3313	0	a	Don't Waste your money on this giant pile of dog crap. Every single time i try to play this game theres a new issue that i have to spend a half hour figuring out how to fix. The game isn't fun enough to make up for the headaches and frustration of trying to get it to run. take your money and go buy a good racing game like Dirt Rally or use it to buy into Iracing
3314	0	a	Very dissapointing, specially comparing it to Assetto Corsa.  A living proof that quantity does not beat quality. Unfinished, buggy, no soul, no feeling, terrible physics, poor performance. Pathetic DK2 support. Pathetic. They should remove the Oculus logo from the start screen, really.  Awesome graphics, that deserves recognition. The Halo Master Chief Collection of the racing genre.
3315	0	a	PROS  + Quite pretty for the most part, apart from a couple of issues mentioned later. + Fairly good selection of first-person cameras. + Menus are crisp and well laid-out. + The logo is quite nice (seriously, I'm struggling quite badly for positives here).   CONS  - AI incapable of racing, but will barge you off the track at any and every opportunity, and never seems to actually lose control even when it should. - Laughs in the face of actual realistic physics. - AI seems to be completely unaffected by rain, not needing to change tyres, remaining fully in control and continuing to post the same lap times as it would in the dry. - Car will veer off the track or spin out for no apparent reason. - Constant (scripted?) engine blowouts - I've even had a few occur on the first corner of the first lap! - Basically zero customisation options: you can't even choose your helmet, and the game will blatantly ignore your choice of number. - Noticeable screen-tearing, even with V-sync on and a 4GB GTX770. - Bland and lifeless crowds at race venues. - Career mode is marketed as sandbox but is in fact linear and lifeless, and doesn't even really let you know what's going on. - Limited selection of vehicles. - Limited and very poor selection of venues. - Go-Karts are awful. Just awful. - No real sense of immersion or of progression. - Extremely poor and limited selection of 3rd person cameras.   Basically, DON'T BUY THIS UTTER CRAP! Spend your money on something else. Anything else. This is the worst racing game I've played in a long time...
3316	0	a	Not a genuine sim - I'm not terribly convinced by Assetto Corsa either but it's worlds better than this, so if you're raised on GPL &amp; similar, don't bother. Looks pretty, though.  Noticed they announced a crowd-funded sequel already, so I'm asking for a refund &amp; getting out.
3317	0	a	Calling paying customers 'Idiots', banning customer from the forums for legitimate concerns, editing forum posts to look like praise when they originally were complaints, paying off other driving sim sites to buy their fake support, asking for money for PCars2, when the first game is barely a month out of release, and then stating 'we don't actually NEED your money'....Broken AI, which entierly ignores your presence on the track, but will race against other AI drivers, numerous bugs, including invisible walls, patches that introduce G27 FF clipping, very basic career mode, dripfeeding DLC....  All reasons to not buy this game, or support the next one.
3318	0	a	Wonderful Graphics, wonderful physics, but the game simply isnt finished. The deleveloper is still releasing patches, but some of the majors issues arent being fixed, and they are already crowd funding its sequal. The car setup system is so poor, Grand Prix Legends of 1998 vintage is far superiour. The developer doesnt like criticism either.
3319	0	a	Bug, bug, bug and more bug. Bugs take me terrible experience, totally stop me enjoy this game.
3320	0	a	I tried this game coming from Assetto Corsa, I saw it on sale and pounced. I found this game very hand-holdy, and unnecessarily complicated like HAVING to click the small 'sign' button for contracts. On top of that the controls feel really squishy. I get 83fps but it is the most unstable 83fps ever.   Maybe it's just because I'm coming from Assetto Corsa, but I can't recommend it.
3321	0	a	I have 170 hours logged in the game, but about 50 of them are using the internet trying to figure out how to get the thing running stable, and 100 trying to work out how the force feedback works. It is the worst implementation of force feedback I have ever seen in any game ever. There are so many settings, and no matter what I do, I feel like I'm driving a boat that somehow suffers from snap oversteer.  Of the 20 hours I have actually played, the AI drive like pastor maldonado on a sugar high, and the career mode is about as rewarding as watching paint dry, only to decide you dont like the colour.  However credit to the art and sound team, the game looks and sounds really good  2/10 Quite possibly the worst but prettiest racing sim I've ever played.
3322	0	a	Let me first start off by stating the positive attributes of the game, and then I will elaborate as to why you the consumer should not waste your time/money on purchasing this travesty of a 'racing simulator'. There is only a few qualities of this game that I can say are positive: 1. Graphics/IQ(don't trust the requirements posted on steam, you will need a high end system in order to achieve ultra IQ at 1080p+/60 fps), the graphics are phenomenal. 2. Track selection: the tracks in this game offer a wide variety of locations. Now for the negative stuff 1. Lack of content, and progression system, the career mode is an absolute joke and lacks vision as well as direction. This game is more inclined to simply be a venue for test driving F1/Super Cars because that's pretty much all you will get out of it. 2. Little to no in game sound tracks, while engine noise is nice the ambient background chime of music seen in almost all racing games is a must. 3. Control's, this one takes the cake and should be the primary reason for not buying this game. If you are using a typical Xbox 360 or similar controller you will be in for quite a shock, as almost every car is virtually uncontrollable or handles like a boat no matter the difficulty settings. It would appear the developers could give a ♥♥♥♥ about the majority of players whom aren't using a wheel with this game. After all is said and done, I have played many racing simulators, and others like them, but this game still cannot stand up to the likes of Gran Turismo, Project Gotham Racing, or Forza. Dare I say it but DriveClub, actually does a better job than this game, finally if you are interested in the new Need for Speed Shift 3 buy it, otherwise avoid it.  Note on System requirements: I am running an extremely high end system when compared to the system requirements listed on steam, and still drop below 60 FPS when running at 1080p on ultra.

3323	0	a	This game has a lot of hype, but it is extremely boring. It's only worthwhile playing with other people.  The amount of vehicles, currently available, is not that good. Most groups/classes, only have 1-3 vehicles to choose from. (unless you like Formula/open wheel) They also promise 'Each month, Project CARS players will also receive a free car. We started with a bang in May with the $3.4m hero car from the movie Furious 7 - the Lykan Hypersport - and players can expect delivery of the next very soon...' Seeing as it's now July, we're still waiting on the 2nd &amp; 3rd free car...  (Edit 10-16-15: 4th free car has been added. We're a few months after release now, &amp; unless you're buying up all the DLC, there aren't many choices for cars. If you own all of the DLC, the car choices are much better now.)   The amount of tracks, currently available, is average. One would expect a lot more tracks than what they have now. Most tracks, currently available, are variations of each other. They boast a whopping 110 courses, when in actual fact, there are only 30 actual tracks, which they call locations, with most having 4+ different layout variations.  http://www.projectcarsgame.com/locations.html   The graphics are above average (I have no issues with an AMD setup, FX6350, R9 280X, with 16GB RAM). Nothing like what you see in the media releases though.  The realism is, well, there is none. This is an arcade racing game allowing tuning of many parts of the vehicle. Yes, each change will alter what the vehicle does, but, the 'simulation' side of things is an illusion. There are too many unrealistic features for some of these cars that, no matter what you alter in settings, it will never feel like you're actually driving it.  The career mode is a waste of time, literally a waste of time. There's no reason to even do the career mode. No story. You don't unlock anything. You don't get special licenses to do special races. The AI is not that good. If anything, the career mode is for people without an internet connection (I.E. PS4 players). I think that's the only reason it's there.  The online mode only searches games within your Steam Download Region, which can only be changed manually.  (This has now been fixed. Well done WMD.)   Controls are not controller friendly, no sensitivity options for throttle, brake or steering. It's either 0% or 100%, nothing in between.  (Steering is now a bit more forgiving with a joystick/controller. Throttle/brake, are still 0% or 100%.)   This game is NOT worth the money they're asking. Even half price is still too much! 60-70% off and you've got yourself a game that is worth buying &amp; playing. Perhaps once they start adding more vehicles, needs about 10x more, it MIGHT be worth buying at its current price.  This is an Early Access game at best!  Edit 7-19-15: I will say that with the past couple updates, they have managed to fix a few bugs &amp; create a better experience when playing. Although, it was at the expense of new bugs &amp; new penalties that may alter your gaming experience. Also, still waiting on these new cars that were promised. And for those that didn't know, WMD have already started working on Project Cars 2. Granted, release is still years away, BUT, please make this game better first!
3324	0	a	Really wish I passed on this one. Worst is every time I finish a race it kicks me back into Windows, and I have to reboot the computer before it will let me play again. I got 30 other games on Steam and Origin and they all work FINE. My computer is TIP TOP and my net connection is blazing. Can I get a patch please? As for the game the graphics are beautiful, even on my 750ti FTW. The races are is all over the place. Why am I in a Porche racing F-1 cars? Why does the Ford Focus handle better than the Porche? Why are the side events so much more fun than the career mode? Man this game should not have been released yet. So much promise.
3325	0	a	CRASH CRASH CRASH CRASH CRASH CRASH CRASH and im not talking about crashing the car.  Game crashes every couple of races devs dont seem to be bothered one bit tried the official forums too.  I know I have more than enough for the specs recommended for the game  CPU- i5 3570k GPU- MSI GTX 970 RAM-16GB OS-Windows 8.  removed my wheel software if it had something to do with that its a poorly optimised game for crashing on its own
3326	0	a	First of HOLY ♥♥♥♥ this game is beautiful, and as long as you just stand still and watch the pretty cars it is all good. But as soon as you begin your first race you will realize that there is something completly wrong with this game. i play with an xbox controller and sometimes the game ignores my inputs and refuses to make a turn so you have to put your stick back to the center and try to get repeat the input this is not a hardware problem i have tested this bug with 3 different controller one of them being a PS controller and they all encounter the same bug. Also sometimes the game will armwrestle the controls from you and force you to make a turn when you want to go steaight for some time. and then there is time... when i am playing the singel player time will begin to slow as i enter the begining of a turn and this effect has no duration bar or anything it is just like bam 50% time speed and bam back to normal, they could atleast give it a more fluid transition. I thought i would give racing another chance even though it have never really been my favorite genre of gaming.  i sincerely hope they will fix some of these bug, so the game becomes playable at some point
3327	0	a	This is more of an arcade than it was marketed as or intended to be. The physics are very unrealistic and I'm not entirely sure what lead this to happen. The tire grip is extremely over-asserted, and the oversteer feels as though it has been exaggerated to compensate. This is especially noticeable with the road cars, which are genuinely unplayable if you're looking for a sim. Absolutely not worth the selling price.  PROS: -Many supported wheels -Optimized 360 controller settings, which is more fitting for this game -Oculus support  CONS: -Extremely inaccurate physics, especially noticeable with road cars -Extremely small and disappointing car selection, especially road cars -Poor track selection. Only 2 or 3 of the essentials, not nearly enough to justify the price -Menu UI is overwhelmingly cluttered and counter-intuitive. I have never had this complaint before -No integrated mod support -Exaggerated arcade car sounds
3328	0	a	This game is, without a doubt, the biggest dissappointment there has been in the driving simulator genre over the past decade. And that's saying a lot, considering Gran Turismo 5 was released in that timespan.   The game lacks basic interface functionality; you can't change the horrible futuristic speedometer you get in racing cars, and you can't even have a rear view mirror in certain camera positions. The menus are irritating and unnecessarily fiddly (and barely functional if you're using a controller), the user interface is cluttered up with pointless ♥♥♥♥♥ such as artificially generated twitter posts, and you have to restart the whole bloody game if you want to alter the graphics options, and sit through approximately 9 hours worth of opening splash screens each time. Hell, you can't even adjust volume levels while in the pause menu, you have to exit back to the main menu; and how exactly are you expected to know where to set the volume levels when you're not driving?  The driving mechanics and car selection certainly don't make up for this either. While Project Cars does seem to offer a dazzling selection of manufacturers and models at a glance, on closer inspection it is apparent that ~70% of the cars available are lazily designed, ugly, soulless race-cars which, quite honestly, all drive identically.  The biggest let-down with Project Cars, however, is the appalling career mode. Instead of sticking to the classic formula of the old Gran Turismo and Forza titles, this game adopts the insipid 'racing contract' system of the famously lifeless Codemasters racing games. Earning credits, finally getting your hands on that gorgeous Jaguar and at last having the power at your fingertips to win greater titles has always been part of the fun of racing simulators; this game throws it away completely. On starting a career, the game railroads you into a tediously narrow selection of cars, then forces you to keep using one for an entire season. What's more, you're stuck with the utterly bland LM racecars right from the start, so there's also no feeling of progress whatsoever in this supposed 'career' mode. The calendar design is intrusive, and sometimes kicks you into round 4 of a race without choice, skipping the qualifying and practice rounds; I can only speak for myself here but being forced to race on a track I've never seen, in a car I don't like, starting in 20th place isn't exactly fun.  Don't be fooled by this game; it may look appealing on first glance, but believe me, you're looking for something else.

3330	0	a	 Disappointment . This game was terribly overhyped. In an attempt to do everything, the only thing they have gotten correct are the graphics (for nvidia). The rest of the game feels like it is a beta release. The fanboy steam community jerk off going on over this game must consist of console gamers. No one should be using the word 'sim' to describe this.  Oh yes it looks phenomenal if you have an nvidia card, but anyone who thinks these cars handle correctly and that the force feedback feels realistic obviously hasn't driven real cars before, or real sims for that matter. Cars don't spin just because you let off of the throttle before you even turn the wheel. The rubber band AI drive like teenagers who just got their license and can get away with antics like cutting corners bouncing their way through the grass. Damage is a joke other than cosmetic, you can plow head first into a wall and back up and continue like nothing happened. You can even shift  without  the clutch all through the RPM range without consequence on stick shift vehicles.The sounds are even a little off, and some (tire squeal for instance) are just straight up unrealistic. I mean judging by sound alone you can't tell if your brakes are squealing or your tires have locked up.   If you love games like Gran Turismo and Forza, you are new to PC racing with a FF wheel (and blissfully ignorant), or you just want a racing game that looks great on your new monitor then this is for you. But if you want a simulation, know how driving a car should feel, have a triple screen setup, oculus rift, or an AMD card -  STAY AWAY . Buy Assetto Corsa instead and save some cash. Or if graphics don't matter as much as physics/feel to you then iRacing is even better than this.
3331	0	a	Got a refund, did not like the weird semi-arcade feel, tracks not great. I'm sticking to Asseto Corsa, iRacing and few others.
3332	0	a	I am not allowed to say most of the words that come to mind about this game. 'Project' is the key word. Unfinished 'Project' lacking the ability to get a refund for a hammered out piece of crap that looks like something EA would unleash upon gamers. CRASH! Surprise! Surprise? No surprise. Its my understanding that if you have an NVIDIA card this game play s fine. If you have AMD it WILL CRASH! Not it might. It WILL. Ive paid half for 3x the content. I had a longer rant but not worth my time.
3333	0	a	I feel robbed!!  Honesty this is not a simulation game at all. it's so arcade like it's not funny, cars just float along with no feeling of being connected to the road minus a few tiny vibrations when you hit an apex.  The frame rate is patheticly unplayable on and AMD components   I want a refund.
3334	0	a	Serious problems with the force feedback in this game. I have spent many hours trying to fine tune this mess. Got somewhere I thought was in my wheel house and ran Laguna Seca to mixed results. Moved on to Watkins and Its all wrong. I play R3, game stock car, iRacing and assetto Corsa. I do not have these issues at all with these games. This has been a wheel setup nightmare! Its beautiful no doubt but it has to be at least capapble on the track and Im having serious Issues. I wan to recommend this game but I am having serious buyers remorse
3335	0	a	I spent $170 odd bucks buying this and all the DLC's coz I loved it on PS4. But they haven't optomised the gameplay and physics properly for PC so it just drives spastically. Slightest turn of the steering and you jack knife. And no its not me, as I said, I owned it on PS4 and it drove competely differently. I did really well. It operates like a completely different game on PC.
3336	0	a	Well, not that good... It had a great potential to be an amazing game, but apparently the developers wasted the chance
3337	0	a	I want my money back. If you give a sh*t about ralism, go for AC. This game is just one big nice looking bug.
3338	0	a	I loved forza as a kid, But this, even from the start i knew my money had sliped out of my ♥♥♥ and in to lazy development that cant see the reality about race sims. They can be great but man, what a let down, kinda like your dog dies but the dog is money.
3339	0	a	poor proformance on VIVE with AMD card. Seems like all cards have some difficulty running the game steady without reprojection kicking in. Even then it was unplayable for me. I'd personally wait for a better VR Racing Sim but if you don't want to wait, don't mind reprojection, and own a NVIDIA GPU you might enjoy this one.
3340	0	a	Wonderful graphics. Nice Lighting. Beautifully made cars. But all that glitters is not gold:  There are three things that let this otherwise brilliant sim down, and they do so in a way that begins as an irritation and ends with utter frustration.   1. There is evidence that the developers have applied an unnecessary and very counter-productive control freakery over the complete lack of user-adjustments in very key areas. While there are endless user preferences for graphics there are almost NONE regarding sound. I find it extraordinary that a sim of this beauty does not allow me to adjust relative sounds, AT ALL. Balance between ai, crowd, engine, user car, tyre noise, skid noise HAS to be user-oriented. It is no good to say 'we know what is best' because everyone's sound systems are different and everyone's hearing is different.  For me the ai sounds and crowd sounds become excruciatingly annoying. Without actually being there, the visceral aid of tyre scrub and squeel is absolutely vital, however good the force feedback is. Yet SMS have, despite thousands of requests to provide proper sound sliders, ignored these requests. Since those requests were made, well over a year ago, they have issued multiple patches and several addon packs, but they have not listened to an overwhelmingly popular request for sound balance sliders. This simple function cannot possibly be hard to implement.  Without these sliders the whole sim for me is ruined. You might think that sound balance is not important, but it is a vital part of what makes a racing sim playable.  2. Some cars have decent physics, but the majority of them default to understeer. An example is the otherwise excellent Lotus 25 in the classic pack DLC. They have ruined this car by making it almost impossible to get rid of the inherent understeer. While the L25 is commendably stable in a straight line it is just too easy to drive around bends, even if you set ridiculously loose rear suspension. BTW the power diff is the wrong way round compared to the description, and that brings me conveniently on to the next big issue:  3. The user interface and total lack of proper explanations and help are staggeringly inept. The interface is designed like a trendy blog with large on-screen squares and fancy graphics, but none of them give any proper info. You spend an inordinate amount of time clicking back and forth between these glitzy menu items to no avail. The whole interface is counter-intuitive and laborious. Let's give an example of user setups, car setups and control setups. None of these functions have a clear way of saving preferences. One makes adjustments and hopes they stick, but they often do not. There is no menu that says 'save your user file HERE'. There is just a save button, but WHERE is this function saved TO? And how does one recall or load these preferences?  The user driver naming, career mode and creation and saving is preposterously confusing and poorly done. I created then deleted several times a new driver / user name but in the pit menu my name is NOT linked to my chosen name but my Steam nickname. Why? I create a career name but it does not appear in the drop down list of drivers, so what is the point of choosing a career name? If I have misunderstood this then I acknowledge it, but why do I have to run through hoops to understand it, or rather not understand it?  Now we come to saving car setups. This is as confusing as it is possibly to be. In 'My garage' there is an option to choose a car and a livery. You can make a car setup here which is odd because you are not on a race track when you do so. How counter-intuitive is that!   But if you first go to a quick race and try to save a setup there, in the very place where setups are relevant, you can't, or at least not reliably. There is a save button but it doesn't load later unless you FIRST make a car setup before you actually go to the race/pit menu. You have to go back to the My Garage menu, save a setup there, then edit and save it within the pit menu later. Again I might have misunderstood and there could be ways around it, but I do not see how.  Moreover, the setup saving is badly explained and further confusing. There is an option to save to 'ALL' or to the track you are currently at. But if you try to save to 'ALL' there appears to be no evidence that it is saved. There is no drop down list of your saves. I find this incredible. It appears that you cannot pick or experiment with several different setups from a pre-saved list. There IS no list! As far as I can see, you can only save one setup per car per track. rFactor, GTL, and even GPL from sixteen years ago had his function!  MANUAL ======  I see a link to a 'digital manual' and go there. It is NOT a manual! It is a brief explanation of some of the functions, but there is no detail. For example there is no in depth explanation of the many parameters in Force Feedback and nor is there any detailed explanation of any other function. They are broad headings with a terse paragraph or two but no clear guide to every function. How can a developer spend years making a potentially great product and then not bother to write a decent manual? If you buy for example a flight sim addon, there are typically several user help documents, many of them running to hundreds of pages with summaries, details and every single function explained.  Conclusion: This could be a wonderful sim. It would be so if the key areas are addressed, and they are a very poor user interface whose slick graphics hide an essentially confusing and clunky user experience, questionable physics which seem to me to be somewhat dumbed down for the sake of games consoles/arcade users and xbox-type controllers, and a complete lack of user control of essential sound balance options.
3341	0	a	I hate serious reviews; all I do is write goofy reviews. But I just rage quit this game again, so serious I'll be: This game is horrible. More succinctly: it's horrible for people that dont take it super seriously.  I grew up on racing games; the more realistic, the better. Drove manual, turned off all assists, and never had issues. I do amateur motorsports for fun in real life and in general play around with the physics of cars to learn. The more, the better.  Then this game came along.   I presumed there'd be a learning curve, but otherwise I know I'd at least enjoy it based on what I've seen and read. So I bought it, installed it, and have spent however many HOURS fighting with it. Tweaking controller settings and tweaking controller settings AND TWEAKING CONTROLLER SETTINGS. There are people that can play this game with no issues, but for whatever reason it is ♥♥♥♥ing impossible to make it where it's comfortable and FUN to play. I KNOW how cars behave; I understand the tiny nuances that can alter/affect vehicle handling. I ♥♥♥♥ing GET physics. But despite knowing that, this crazy-♥♥♥ simulation never feels right. The biggest issue is that cars are twitchy and lose grip out of nowhere with no indication or warning. For whatever reason, that kind of feedback is not put into the controller. So I can't count how many times I've completed turns as smoothly as possible and I STILL end up seeing the inside wall from sudden, magical oversteer when exiting a turn.  There are plenty of other horrible things about this game like a magical AI that have perfect lines, jacked up power, and adhesive ultra-soft tires when you crank the difficulty. The sound is janky with all noises except your engine being loud as ♥♥♥♥. I have all sounds except my engine turned down to 60% and I STILL hear some AI car 100 feet behind me more than I hear my own engine. Overall vehicle choice is incredibly imbalanced and lacking in variety, DLC car packs are usually random crap with no real value. The cursor never goes away despite the fact that I'm using a controller, so I always have to reach out and move the cursor off the screen. Controller settings are CONSTANTLY being reset. Random lock ups and crashes abound. Plus whenever you're in the zone and concentrating on finding an opening to pass, that IDIOT pit chief starts yapping and it makes me lose it EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. No way to turn him off, either. I know how to strategize my own movements, I don't need pre-recorded garbage chirping in when I need distraction the least.  Just so many tiny things that add up to the THE most disappointing game purchase I think I've ever made. I was ready to adore this game and all that ever happens is I try to play and I end up screaming so much my throat hurts and rage quit 10 minutes later. To me it's an ultra simulation that requires a wheel and insane amounts of tinkering to be able to enjoy. There's no fun 'out of the box', and it's for that reason I can't recommend this game. Not to casual gamers like myself that would rather play a game than tinker with it to no avail.
3342	0	a	I have enjoyed this game a lot, much of it VR with wheel and pedals (at a friends place), which is just AWESOME. Have also played with keyboard and most recently joystick. All are well implemented and does not take many hours to get accustomed to.  Still dunno what the carreer is about.  Pros: - graphics - amount of realism - track accuracy - not completely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI  Cons: - So obviously nvidia biased, it should have added 'made for nvidia' in the title (luckily, I happen to own an nvidia card) - AI is not super - after many hours of play, I still dont know what the carrer is about - Tried online play a few times, but gave it up caus of trolls (destruction derby)  I want to like and reccomend the game, but the bad practice of degrading performance of a chip manufacturer (amd) to make the other (nvidia) look better, because you where handed some $ is morally wrong in my eyes. Wont buy the next one if that trend continues.
3343	0	a	Would love to play the game, but the VR is eternally bugged and that's the only reason I bought it. All models bug out and I've been troubleshooting for hours. It may be a good game on its own, but if you're looking for VR then look elsewhere.
3344	0	a	As much as I loved the graphics and UI, the driving experience was so glitchy that it made the game unplayable. The car would randomly jerk to one direction when my wheel had not been moved. The wheel would also be very twitchy and twitch to one side and then back to the center very quickly. About every third shift I would make (with the paddle shifters) would not be registered in game. It is worth noting that this wheel worked perfectly fine in every other racing game I tried with it including DiRT 3 and DiRT Rally. Very disapointed.
3345	0	a	So, Project Cars. This is my first steam review ever so pardon me if it's not that helpful  I bought this game in the Steam sale, and let me tell ya, it's fun. When you start.  The game feels... weird. When you start out, with the go-karts, the game is great. Superkarts was great fun for me and i was getting progessively better as I learned what everything does and learned how to tune, what to tune and why.  At this point I was having a lot of fun with the game, but as the game progressed, as tracks got more complex, you could start to see the cracks show up with bumps in the road that literally sent the car flying, AI cutting corners like it's nothing (and not getting punished by it), crashing into you when you're CLEARLY not doing anything wrong (following a racing line, and doing everything perfect), etc.  When I left karting, I left this game. I played a couple of seasons of Karts, and won the second one when I already knew the tracks and was used to the car. I moved forward, only to see that the cracks that were simply annoying in Karting were gigantic and horrible in other disciplines. From being unable to heat up your wheels, to the AI straight up ramming you, to the AI not being affected by tyre wear or weather conditions, to tracks being bumpy where they're not supposed to, and oh so many more issues.  I'll admit, I had my fun with the game. Karting was extremely fun and challenging and I was playing in the hardest difficulty and winning but not by too much. But then the cracks start to show and things start to get weird and you just get frustrated with the game and stop playing it.  If you can get this game for less than 20 of your currency (dollars, euros, pounds), it is worth some 20h of playtime and you can judge yourself if that's worth it for you or not. But for the full price, the game is not worth it as you will not put enough hours into it to make it 'cheap' so to say. Unless you wanna be a kart racer for the rest of your life.
3346	0	a	Tried to connect to 8 online games, everytime I got disconnected. Feels like the developers no longer care about this game. Save your money on something else.
3347	0	a	I refunded my money after 1.4hour of struggling to get my wheel settings right.  The game is nothing like Gran turismo and the tire pressure is very fake a long with the suspension system.  Very plenty race courses and very detailed graphics. Just gameplay is not really there when it comes to racing imo.   And yes... I compare every racing game to Gran turismo 5/6
3348	0	a	Crap. It's not ported to PC. If you don't have an Xbox controller, don't waste your time. Even when I went to reset the buttons, it only showed an xbox controller and no keyboard. WTF? How am I supposed to remap the controls. GARBAGE.
3349	0	a	So much potentiall! But im giving it a no because of the absolutely dumb ai which hinders you from keeping a pace in endurence races and the fact that i probably have spent more time in the menues trying to smoth out the quite frankly bad handeling for the cars...im not sure what it is. And it looks like slightly mad studios isnt planing on fixing anything.
3350	0	a	Well, here we go with my initial impressions and I'm not going to sugar coat it.   The good: Awesome selection of cars and tracks + an extensive career mode. The visuals and sound is also brilliant. Very nice damage model.  The less than good: The physics doesnt feel right for something that is supposed to be more sim orientated that an arcade game. Dont get me wrong, this is no need for speed but somehow it feels like its not entirely there. I have more fear of corners in GRID than in Project cars. It just takes so much to unsettle a car but when that happens you have no idea that you are on the edge until you loose it and correcting the car is impossible as it feels like you are skidding on ice. Getting the force feedback on my wheel (G27) dialed in properly was an absolute nightmare and still it is severely lacking.  The lack of proper feedback through the wheel is terrible and it robs you of so much. This is probably my single biggest issue as it makes it very difficult to figure out how close you are taking the car to the edge.  In Assetto Corsa I can feel so much more via the wheel and that title really lets you know what is happening with the car. I am hoping that I will be able to work around this when I have Simvibe set up...but ultimately some fixingfrom the developer would be required.   Performance wise, this is definitely a title that can bring your rig to its knees. I run an i72600K (4.4Ghz), 16GB RAM and a GTX980 SLI setup and had to fiddle to get it to feel smooth (even at a framerate of above 100fps there seems to be lag with all settings on max). Dropping the motion blur as well as the AA settings, fixed this quite nicely and the game is definitely not much worse off eye candy wise.   My verdict at this point is that there is still a lot of work to be done and some refinement is needed. If you are looking for the best looking racing 'sim' around, this is it.  To those of you who are used to Assetto Corsa, note that this will probably not draw you away from your AC fix, even when Kunos does an update and breaks stuff. Project Cars is beautiful but does not rival AC for feel or realism.    Update (2015/06/30): After spendig quite some time with this, I can honestly say that this game is sh*t. It looks great but the physics and AI suck. Cars dont get unsettled when you try to do so but the handling goes for a ball of cr@p FOR NO APPARENT REASON!!! AI is dumb as SH!T as well. especially in wet races. So if you fancy a demolition derby game, this will knock your socks off. Unless they fix the issues properly regarding the FFB and physics I will most likely end up not playing it anymore... Simvibe helps with adding some feedback but you can only do so much with a flawed physics engine, dumbass AI and poor FFB.  THIS IS RUBBISH...GIVE IT A PASS. DON'T BUY THIS GAME!!!!!  As of Patch 9.0:  The game has improved somewhat although the issues with FFB, AI and physics still persist. SMS seem to be fixing some things with every patch but glaring omissions like triple screen support has been dropped altogether with focus being more on DLC. Said DLC for the most part is not bad but it would be nice if the core issues with the game were fixed in full.  Unfortunately the physics and handling of the cars still feels somewhat suspect.  Fps also seems to be inconsistent. When i fire it up, it may run at 52fps or double that. Seems like the luck of the draw.  I keep hoping that PCars will become what it said on the box... Sadly 9 patches down it still does not exactly cut it and with PCars2 on its way, i wonder if there will be another 9 patches deployed to fix things before no 2 is all the rage and this one is left by the wayside.  Needless to say I will most likely not support SMS in their new endeavors.  PCars is no longer a flaming ball of crap...but a smoldering ball of crap is not a much better experience in the end. It still stinks, just not as bad.
3351	0	a	bloody brilliant.   nuff said.   was my original review.  Living with this game for a little while now the well documented bugs that they have just ignored spoils it. yes it is a great game when it works but you really have to keep your fingers crossed that it does.   its all ok though they have started on project cars 2 now.  I think they should polish this turd for a little longer before making the next.  Also this is gammer funded, so we pay them to make the game then buy it off them, and we fell for it hook line and sinker.
3352	0	a	Great Simcade (more arcade than sim), it's like a combination of Forza and NFS Shift. They fixed the input lag from the previous NFS Shift games. The cars feel quite good, though the physics aren't that accurate in my opinion. Cars sound decent, they covered alot of rare tracks ( e.g Hockenheim Ring or Oschersleben). I'm racing with my g27 (great rig btw) and the FFB isn't that good compared to Asseto Corsa. Just like I said, it's more of a Simcade than a Sim... But the overall package is quite entertaining. Experienced some performance issues maxed out @  Gigabyte R9 280x  I7 4790  Y R U ♥♥♥♥ERS RATING DIS SO BAD? IMA N0Sc0PezZ2 U 5 ever it aint easy bra   This game is nothing compared to asseto corsa. SMS sells this as a 'simulation' which is quite hilarious.
3353	0	a	Really hard to recommend... runs badly, some tracks don't load (infinite loading bug) it's not what i was hoping to find in 'the ultimate car simulator'  I tried it but things like not being able to look around properly were so annoying. Everything needs to be adjusted before you can start having a fun experience. 
3354	0	a	I've played a heap of racing games over the last 29 years and this one has really annoyed me. Riddled with weird bugs that like to jump out at you at random times and a draving feel that feels terrible. Each car feels exactly the same in that they all handle like you're on ice. It's such a strange driving experience and it's very annoying. I've played the ♥♥♥♥ off Gran Turismo 1,2,3,4,5 etc and the Forza games and each car feels slightly different be it heavy, tail happy, understeering, fast on the acceleration or a mix of a few and so on. However, unfortunatly, the vehicles here all feel like you're playing Car Curling. Y'know the one, a long path of ice and you throw a heavy weight down it? This is what this game feels like. Point the car forward, accelerate and hope the wind or some other force of nature just happens to move you from side to side. Very unpredictable driving and a serious let down.
3355	0	a	whoever designed this game, hvaen't thought thru keyboard control when its raining. its impossible to drive when its raining with keyboard control. i was winning the race with 20s and rain started and i was spinning in place before i gave up.
3356	0	a	The game renders so badly on the HTC vive I feel like I want my money back.
3357	0	a	Project CARs is a realistic real-world racing simulation intended to bring together the most diehard racing fans from accross the world. Project CARS was released in Mid 2015 after a delay in production and has been releasing patches to improve the game ever since. After playing this game through many months of development, I have found the graphics are very appealing to the eye and certainly draw in race enthusiasts to the pleasing graphics of the game. Unfortunately, the asthetics and logic behind the game, especially the artificial intellegence are not quite up to par. After many patches were released in an attempt to increase the efficiency of the artificial intellegence, there was little changed, subsequently resulting in many deficcient release patches. This game is very useable with an easy to manage interface, and an in-depth career mode that will take you from zero to hero. The graphics and user interface of Project CARS are very unique in its class like no other, but is balanced out by an in-efficient artificial intellegence system within the game. The physics engine is for the most part very realistic with a few minor bumps in the road that can surely be fixed in the future. Other bugs include usability issues with the Logitech G27 Racing Wheel. Often times during a race, the will will simply disconnect and you must reboot the game in order to continue gameplay.   Positives Qualities:  -Pleasing Graphics -Easy To manage User Interface -On Par Physics Engine  Negative Qualities:  -Below Par Asthetics -Unreliable Artificial Intellegence - Bug And Compatibility Issues Exist Within the Game  While the graphics and user interface are easy to manage, the main focal point of the game which includes the artificial intellegence and gameplay are not always relaible and are twitchy eight times out of ten. This makes the game discouraging for the user playing it and will surely have many players leaving in no time. I do think Project CARS has potential for the future, but Slightly Mad Studios needs to get Slightly More Mad in order to win over the ratings with this one.  Rating: 7/10
3358	0	a	If you have a AMD gpu do not buy this game, trust me you will thank me in the long run!
3359	0	a	pro: This game is hilarious to play  con: the steering sucks and it still needs work. it is not worth 50 dollars.
3360	0	a	In my hype for a forza game, I bought this instead cause I was told it's the closest thing to forza there is... ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t!  There are no ♥♥♥♥ing cars! How the hell are you gonna make a game called project cars with no ♥♥♥♥ing cars?!? They should have called it project racing...  I'm sure it's a great racing game, but the lack of being able to use and customize any car I want really make it 'just another racing sim' and nothing special at all...
3361	0	a	This game is meant to be a race-sim. As such, it offers a multitude of changes in the setup of a car.  BUT the setups get not saved due to a bug.  Therefore, you can play with the setup all you want. If you're lucky the game will save it, if you aren't all your work was in vain. This bug has been known to the devs since day one, but it has not been solved.  It's my bad luck I didn't know about this issue, or I would not have bought the game or would have returned it in time.  If you are a race-sim fan: DO NOT BUY
3362	0	a	first this game was awesome( the AI has always been sh/t) but then the developers became hungry for money everything has a price, quite a high price. i now also have assetto corsa: better AI and the dlc's are way cheaper. sorry project cars but im going to play assetto corsa now
3363	0	a	Why this game dont have clutch wear/damage? - No clutch. - Handling.  + Graphic. + Car choice. + Brake heat effect.
3364	0	a	force feed back weak u can do 100mph plus over bumps in the road an feel nothing lets it down for me
3365	0	a	I purchased Project CARS looking for something fun and potentially deep to play in VR (HTC Vive). I found the VR interface to be pretty awful, to the point where the game was unplayable. After I write this review I'm going to attempt to get my money back.  The VR menus of the game are huge and up really close to your face, requiring you to move your head around to see the options. The driving gameplay is seated, with a headless driver model that steers the car, which I found really weird and immesion-breaking. I'd rather not have a body at all than a body I'm not physically attached to and does not mirror my actions.  Because the body of the driver and the car don't move at all inside the play space, they need to be centered on your head and adjusted before the driving starts. The first time I booted up the game, I was holding the headset in my hands, clicking through the installer. The game world centered on the headset while I was holding it, down low and pointed at a 60 degree angle away from my couch. I spent my first 10 minutes with the game with my head clipped half through the car I was supposed to be driving, searching (and searching and searching) for a way to fix this in the menus. There was no recenter option. I eventually found a settings page that let me pick when I wanted recentering to occur: at game start or at race start. Race start was off by default. There was no interactive 'recenter now' option, which was incredibly frustrating, nor any controls to manually adjust the centering.   I restarted the game holding my head as perfectly still as I could in a comfortable position until the main menu came up. The centered position was better than before, (I was in the car at least!), but not perfect, and the game provides no way to fix it. There were a few manual adjustments for seat position in the car but that was it.   This unacceptable in a $30 title. It would be unacceptable in version 0.1 of a fan-made VR conversion patch.  The driving, once it started, was a little too simulationy for my tastes, even on novice. The cockpit view was super crowded and provided a poor view of the road. It was impossible to see where I was supposed to be going. All this made me feel motion sick after a short time. I couldn't help but feel like the experience I was having: discomfort, nausea, and calustrophobia was just a little too much authenticity for me.  I do not reccomend this game for casual driving fans who are looking for something in VR. I'm sure if I bought the game for hardcore simulation and was playing on a screen with a wheel, maybe I'd feel differently. For people who are not in my position, I defer to the other reviews.
3366	0	a	The amount of force feedback settings is just puzzling and cars feel very s*** on stock settings.  And you have to set the ffb for every car individually? Why? Please fix this.  
3367	0	a	The amount of force feedback settings is just puzzling and cars feel very s*** on stock settings.  And you have to set the ffb for every car individually? Why? Please fix this.  
3368	0	a	Im sure this is a great game, but after a whole night of trying to get my controls to work, and my TrackIR to work, no luck. I would not have refunded this game, had I were able to get it to work with Xbox controller and TrackIR. The game sounds great, the reviews are pleasing enough... My review is personal and based on forum search and myself trying to get the contgroller and TrackIR to work. I think in a game that is supposed to be immersive, the design has to be as such, where the gamer would interact with it and not have to even think about controls. This game, at start (where I have been up until I refunded it), crushes the life out of wanting to play this game. 3/10 because the game is impossible to get started. I have many other games to play, which had allowed my to stave off the frustration of losing a whole night, trying to get this game to work. Im sure the Devs are awesome... But, this game killed my buzz.
3369	0	a	Honestly. This game ♥♥♥♥ing sucks, wasn't made for a controller at all. CAN NOT reach settings when in a race. There is SO much that is locked and I can't change. It's an overal bad game.
3370	0	a	okay let me get this ♥♥♥♥ out. at least 30% of the pcars community CAN'T handle criticism, including the staff. Want to get banned on pcars forum? Don't post sexual content that would take too long, just post criticism about their game and watch as you get bashed and get a ban hammer to the face.   10/10 would make pcars staff rage again
3371	0	a	There are tons of cars and tracks to drive which can be very fun. Unfortunately there are still several bugs that have gone unfixed. An unnecessary amount of FFB settings means that you'll spend several our tweaking them in order to make your wheel feel the way it should by default. Right now the only thing moderately enjoyable is hot lapping because the AI is inconsistent at best. The game has potential to be really good, but it unpolished and at this point still needs work.
3372	0	a	Really disapointed.. Lack of triple screen support. I want to love this game but Im back playing AC and rf2 
3373	0	a	My first impressions of Pcars were good. Stunning visuals along with excellent cars sounds and vehicle handling realism. I race with a Logitech g27 wheel. The wheel support and custimization in game is very good. In game the vehicle handles as Id expect it to in real life which fora simulator game is a big deal. It Did not take me many hours though to realize that Pcars has many faults which in my opinion outweight the pros, he biggest of these being the career mode, car selection and instability. The career was dreadfully uncreative with no excitement beside actually driving a car which brings me to the next point; the lack of cars. This isnt all bad due to the fact it takes time to learn how to drive each car properly. Most of my game time was spent driving the RUF Yellowbird. I would have appreciated a few more road cars and more American and Japanese cars. The name itself is misleading since the game has well under 100 cars which are mostly European race cars. The stability of the game has also caused me grief even in the 10 hours of gameplay. Frequent crashes and fps drops make it difficlut to play. I cannot reccomend the game to people who seek a racing experience like i did. It is designed more for those who love Hot Lap simulators with not much else
3374	0	a	Wasted 24 hours trying to find decent settings for the xbox one controller and steering wheel. Shouldnt have to. Replays are no good, the cars stutter backwards and forwards. The annoying thing is I bet theres a decent game to be had if they bothered to give proper controller settings. Uninstalled.
3375	0	a	A real shame, good game, fine mix of arcade and sim racer, but it is totally ruined by an AI worse than the AI in GT6 and the rain... It is always raining, and the rain is really local so it only affects your car and only the part of the track you are driving on at any given moment.  This just makes it impossible to enjoy, and yes I do know that it rains, but I refuse to belive that Laguna Seca (in California, you know the place that is running out of water) has rain every weekend. But like i said, this is actually a good game, so it is a real shame that such minor problems ruins a potentially great game.  Positive: Easy to get started, lots of different types of cars, tracks from around the world Negative: The rain, the rain and the bad AI 
3376	0	a	game sucks, I have been waiting for it since announced what two years ago, and since I bought it, it has been nothing but a dissapointment, buggy as hell, hard to assign controllers, the updates cause more problems then they are worth, the game is pretty, but it sucks....
3377	0	a	Let's make it simple and clean.  Pro -Graphics -many tracks  Con -few cars -handling  Con+ -runs very bad on AMD GPU's (R9 280X in that case)
3378	0	a	Buggy and laggy. Online racing shocks and lags as hell.
3379	0	a	A lot of potential, but at the end it is a poor game. The sound is the worst thing in this game, its so bad that i wonder how that ever release it with this, or their sound editor defenetly has ears problem.  Graphics are good. Gameplay is somehow clunky and this game really needs alot of pollishing.  Not for hardcore car fans.
3380	0	a	Fun game till your save file gets corrupted and you never wish to play it again. Thanks nvidia for the awful drivers, and thanks MAD for not implementing steam backups.
3381	0	a	Graphics Impress, shame about the handling and feel.   In short, it beats Assetto Corsa in the eye candy dept, but for everything else, including realistic physics, Assetto Corsa is still King.
3382	0	a	Fun game till your save file gets corrupted and you never wish to play it again. Thanks nvidia for the awful drivers, and thanks MAD for not implementing steam backups.
3383	0	a	It may have been my computer, but this game runs terribly. Opimization is incredibly horrid and there is a good 1 sec lag on controls. The only outstanding part of this game is karts and open-wheel collisions.
3384	0	a	Graphics are decent, the amount of cars avaliable is good. I love the driving physics and the weather effects. Theres plently of leagues to choose from. I straight out love this game...... except for THE GOD DAMN AI!!! WTF?   I am sorry, I really tried to like this game. But after beeing bumped out of the same turn on the same track restarting my Formula C session 25 times and the AI rear bumped me on a wet track EVERY GOD DAMN TIME, then its more frustrating then fun! I can see them, but I cant avoid them. They are way to unpredictable. I try desperatly to slow down and do this 90 degree right turn, and every single time no mather what someone bumps my damn rear.  If I try to drive passively I spin out trying to avoid the crazy damn AI, I`ve tried everything, the only thing that worked was lowering the difficulty so much that the AI became braindead. Thats no fun. I won with 1 and a half lap...... is there no middle ground?  I`m even racing passively, I let them pass me if I cant loose them. I keep my distance as much as possible in turns and only drive past them on straights. I drive flawlessly, still I cant avoid the AI. Its as if they are targeting me sometimes.   Is programing an AI in a racing game really that hard? If I turn up the AI difficulty at all they keep bumpind and crashing into me. I know that the AI is suposed to be 'aggresive' at times, but god damn! Having an AI slamming your side or rear so hard that you crash and have to break the race? WTF? THIS IS NOT REALISTIC! ITS FRUSTRATING!  I mean, accidents happen sure thats realistic. But not when it happens several times in every single race.... I have to drive like a old grandma with an expired license and broken glasses just to avoid beeing rammed of the track.    But its not only on this track no, almost every single track I`ve raced on against AI. The AI suddenly and for NO reason just ignores my presence completely. Slamming into me hard, as if it didnt register that I was there. WTF?  Sadly I played this game too much and cant get a refund.... or I would....  Fix your damn AI before calling it a 'sim driver' please. Its not a sim when I feel like everyone else on the track want to kill me. Thats not realistic, thats lazy design. I`ve seen better AI in 15 year old racing games on PS1.
3385	0	a	this game is abosoulutely a peice of ♥♥♥♥ you cant honestly tell me this game is even close to simulation the cars handle like absolute garbage. The controls are absolutley horendous! Get better!
3386	0	a	This game looks and sounds really good. And that's all it does. If I could return this game, i wouldn't hesitate a single second!  It is absolutely unplayable with a controller and the performance it takes off of your cpu &amp; gpu is far beyond every reasonable argument. It's like an unoptimized beta with fps drops, graphic bugs and immense lags! Moreover the community consists of the biggest ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s I've ever seen in a Racing Simulator. It feels like 90% of them crash on purpose. Last but not least: The Tuning Setup is a big joke. E.g. you can choose between 3 different premade gear ratio setups on a GT3 car. You could manipulate every gear as you like but this will end in two overlapping gears with the same ratio.  If you really like racing simulators, I can only recommend playing GranTourismo or AssettoCorsa and leave this graphicblender behind.  P.S.: I play many games e.g. Star Citizen, BF4 etc. with no problems, so it can't be my rig being poor.
3387	0	a	A lot of potential, but at the end it is a poor game. The sound is the worst thing in this game, its so bad that i wonder how that ever release it with this, or their sound editor defenetly has ears problem.  Graphics are good. Gameplay is somehow clunky and this game really needs alot of pollishing.  Not for hardcore car fans.
3388	0	a	This game seriously sucks. It lacks content and feels unfinished. There`s close to nothing to do ingame, and it`s not even fun to drive. I`ll have to refer to kacperflak`s review of this game, because it issues most of the flaws with this game.   The developers are constantly fixing bugs, that should have already been fixed even before the game was released, and still the game has huge flaws in graphics, sounds, settings and much more. I do sincerly not recommend you to buy this game.
3389	0	a	0/10 - Because review scores are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.  This game had potential but quickly turned into a Cash-grab for SMS and became a joke of an E Sports contender, with all of the community events in 2016 focusing soley on the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t E Sports market.  Most cars and tracks are old models from other SMS games and the only insult to it is the price to pay for it. Some car classes are broken by the DLC cars, throwing old road cars in with old race cars or mixing F1 cars, the 72D will never keep up with the 78.   AI selection is absent too, so doing a mixed field GT race will have ALL THE CARS with GT in their title in the field, ever wanted to race against a GT40 while doing the Bathurst 12 Hour in a GT4 Mustang while still having the GT3 cars to overtake you? TOO BAD!  There also seems to be a load of bugs still, during online races I would often get wrecked just by tapping wheels, one time even being wrecked because the game glitched the grid, placing another car under me.  The FFB took me a year to get to a level where I could enjoy driving it, being a confusing mess and I only sorted it when I stopped using FFB setups that would be considered 'Normal' in my other wheel-based games.  AI is great in this game, aside from a few bugs that have the AI pit on the last lap of a race if it starts raining (which ruined a perfect enduro race I staged) but aside from a few buggy classes of vehicles, most of the rest can kerb-hop and battle for position sometimes, if the game doesn't go and supercharge them like it is prone to do.  You can have some fun with this game, offline it is a decent simcade mode.  As I have said before with other racing sims, wait until the second game and even then, give it a few months before buying this one to see if the 2nd game can be improved over this mess, which could have cornered the Gran Turismo for PC market that some of us have been waiting for since GT turned to crap.

3392	0	a	Stupid junky controls. I can't even change them.
3393	0	a	Worst racing game of the modern era. All of its competition completely blows it out of the water. Playing this the graphics reminded me of Gran Turismo 4 for the PS 2. But thats about the only thing it had in common with that fantastic classic; There are an amazingly lackluster amount of cars in the game. Seriously, theres about 3 road cars in the game, and 1 or 2 cars for each class that all feel the same as the other cars in the class. There are a lot of tracks in the game but I imagine its pretty easy to add a lot of maps if they have less detail and less graphical fidelity than Forza 3.  Controls with a controller are absolutely atrocious and if you plan on using a controller DO NOT GET THIS GAME PERIOD. I cannot even put into words how terrible it is with a controller, as many people on the internet forums have complained about.   Bottom Line: THERE IS NO REASON TO GET THIS GAME WHEN FORZA 6 AND GRAN TURISMO EXIST. This game is worse than the competition in every single way, most importantly content. I actually find it amazing that a PC game managed to have worse graphics than console exlusives.  Seriously, I think this game has less cars than that Ferrarri exclusive racing game.  1/10 worst racing game I've ever played. The only reason it gets as high as 1 is because it has a great options menu.   Oh ya, and some idiot decided to make the default post race button 'restart' instead of 'continue', so you have to scroll up before you press A or you'll be restarting your race. Seriously how stupid do you have to be as a dev to make restart default.
3394	0	a	I had kept tabs and followed this game since it was first announced and I'm really disappointed that the game has so many bugs its implayable. I can barely play the game! I crash so often I can't finish a race so I have to restart again... and again. Its stupid. Don't get this game right now until you know the bugs and glitches are fixed. Despite the amazing gameplay that I can manage to squeeze out before the game crashes... its not really worth it right now. FIX THE GAME PLEASE.
3395	0	a	Enjoyable for the most part but feels incomplete and full of bugs. Menus and interface are confusing and seem to forget settings often. Difficulty is not balanced at all through different events and classes making it impossible to get the right challenge. Graphics are great in places, underwhelming elsewhere. The anti-aliasing seems incredibly inefficient and performance through the most demanding sections is poor. Maintaining 1080p60 is difficult even with top-tier hardware. I'd struggle to recommend the game in its current state, at full price at least.
3396	0	a	Way too many bugs, going back to Assetto Corsa.... how do I get my money back?
3397	0	a	A buggy mess and there doesn't seem to be any patches to fix most of the bugs since launch day.  The AI is complete garbage and is guaranteed to crash in to you at least once during any given race.
3398	0	a	Not quite what I was expecting. The game looks great, but the gameplay is just not that great. The menu interface also leaves a negative impact, especially the text in the Career menu.
3399	0	a	this game SUCKS because ''realistic AI'' is just not braking while you go wheel-to-wheel with them so a corner they just crash into you..
3400	0	a	It's not very realistic to be honest, you barely turn left or right and the rear end is so loose that it feels like I'm playing an arcade game instead of a racing simulator. The Gran Turismo series and even Forza have a better physics engine which is kind of sad considering this is on the pc... This racing 'sim' does have an epic soundtrack also the graphics are really amazing to be honest but the game overall feels like an arcade.
3401	0	a	I still dont understand this game, I tried changing the settings to make more sense to me, but I still never understood how to play the game. I spent about half an hour trying to understand, but I never did. I got this game at the winter sale last year for $20 and I think it's the worst $20 I've ever spent.
3402	0	a	Don't bother unless you have a proper steering wheel. Unplayable with a controller. Also has a weird Glitch where the game changes your DESKTOP BACKROUND to something random.. Easily fixed by saving the theme but WTF?
3403	0	a	cant believe this is featured.  games broken for so many ppl.  not worth it, plz god save your money/time/non-gray hair.
3404	0	a	The game has about 30 cars. Some cars hit the pit wall while leaving the garage in auto drive. A few tracks aren't true to the real tracks. Nurburg has banners for Porsche. AI races as if you weren't event on the track.   Uninstall/10
3405	0	a	I was excited to see Project Cars come onto the scene especially with the open 'Free Practice' and open cars to pick. I've always loved Car driving sims and archade. In 1987 Test Drive came out (By Accolade) I used to start up on a IBC PC DOS machine. After a couple of releases from Accolade Sony came out with the Grand Turismo Series. I also injoyed the early Rally (Colin McRae) series. Great Car sims! Project cars is a great car simulator with really good graphics. Unfortunately it drops frames and the screen goes blank when I play with AI drivers. I have a Radeon HD 6870, i7-2600 Quad core processor and 16 GB of the best memory around. Don't get this game if you have a Radeon graphics card as it won't run. I have to go to task manager and cancel the game. To bad because I really like the way the game is set up. Until Slightly Mad Studios fixes this problem I can't recommend this game.
3406	0	a	Very dissapointing with too few cars, a stupid amount of bugs and broken online. Don't waste your money on this game, if you want a decent racing game get Shift 2 or get LFS/RFactor/Assetto Corsa/iRacing. Those are much better than this.  Stop downvoting this, it's true, try some of the other, much cheaper and better racing games out there and you will find a proper experience.
3407	0	a	My worst investment of 2012, SMS has promised us so much more. And I expected a decent multiplayer experience. The game is still unfinished and never will be, because the biggest part of the SMS team will be busy with pCars 2. I wouldn't recommend anyone to invest in pCars 2, just wait until it's released. Uninstalled...
3408	0	a	1 month after its offical release, the devs announced Project Cars 2....the first one still suffers from bugs and other problems. Don't support this type of underhanded business. There are better racing sim developers out there who are more deserving of your money
3409	0	a	Good graphics, but way too many bugs &amp; glitchiness  I prefer Assetto Corsa over this anyday.
3410	0	a	I've had enough now, the amount of crippling bugs you run into on a race by race basis is just too much. 6 more months of work are probably needed before it becomes a rather good racing game, it's not there yet.  Alas that's not going to happen, SMS focus has moved to PCARS2
3411	0	a	Do not bother with this game. The developers sent out a sub-par product and instead of fixing what could be a great racing sim, they announce Project Cars 2. They are more worried about getting money out of pockets than producing a playable game.   The Good: The cars are beautiful and the noises are great. Having sunlight light blind you as you enter the corner, not being able to see the exit, is an amazing experience.  The Bad: The cold tires are a pain in the ♥♥♥ to warm up. You are completely worthless until they get warm and the AI just come screaming past. Can not touch the curbs, no matter the size, without spinning. Getting turned in on by an AI leaves me with 2 options. Take damage and ruin my race or get out of his way, spin and ruin my race. And the AI will turn in on you.  The Ugly: The AI. The AI are overly aggressive and drive like drunken 12 year olds. They brake way too early or way too late. I can not begin to count the times I have been punted off track by the AI behind just being plain stupid. The AI get in each others way and cause pile ups. The AI can drive through asphalt, grass, tarmac, gravel, and sand all at the same speed. They do not lift off, just keep going with out a care in the world and rejoin into the side of whomever just happens to be there.
3412	0	a	Not yet ready. The entire game is more like a beta. Many parts are not finished or buggy - some cars have broken physics while others are great, on some tracks the ai is downright broken, sound cuts out and session has to be restarted to get it back, HUD display costs 10fps ...  This has the potention to be great but atm it stinks of an early release. Take a look a few months down the line if things have been wipped into shape via patches.  Edit: After a few more days of driving I would not rate it either tumbs up nor down. The GT-races are really fun an intense. Other cars like to old classic F1 cars seem too much to handle properly for the ai resulting in chaotic races that are less fun.   As it stands I would say 80-90% of the content is great and the rest need some patches. It sill remains an early release but it can be whipped into shape.
3413	0	a	As it stands, I can`t recommend this game; I`m only glad I bought it from Amazon rather than Steam, as it was £15 cheaper. You can have all the pretty graphics, single player and multplayer modes and options you like, but if the basics are broken - namely the FFB and handling, you won`t be playing for long.  The default FFB settings for my wheel (T300) are so feeble that they might as well not be there, and no amount of adjusting the ridiculous number of settings improves this. And yes, I downloaded the `tweaks` files from the forum. Also, despite the description of the game as a simulation, the cars handle more like they do in Grid, rather than Assetto Corsa or RaceRoom; that is, they stick to the road come rain or shine. Until the handling and FFB are patched to make the game more playable with less effort, I recommend passing on PCars and, for less money - and if you can put up with outdated graphics and mostly South American tracks - Stock Car Extreme.
3414	0	a	to anyone considering buying this game because they played forza. please reconsider first, this is not forza.  the landscape and tracks are beautiful and the cars just the same.   but the control mechanics are sup par to the point where some vehicles are uncontrollable.   the steering overly sensitive where a slight turn can put you in the wall. the cooled tires are over exaggerated just the same.   counter steering is nearly impossible as it just sling shots you to the other side of the wall. the braking mechanics are a little slow where I feel a mclaren has the brake calipers of a 60's caddilac.   assists do not really help the mechanics in the game.   the driving lines when slowing down or brake are inaccurate where i mostl likely end up in the wall or in the field.   the AI's, are either really slow or make perfect lines to the point where it looks like they are riding on rails.  i had such great hopes for this game as i was looking for something to substitute forza and my xbox being in the military and unable to bring them with me.   i recently hope they might put out a patch for the game. I sure hope they do because i do see potential. but until then i dont feel i will continue to play this game!!
3415	0	a	Some of the cars handle unrealistically and it requires a lot of tweeking to get the FFB to feel 'right' with a wheel.  The A.I. is terrible.  The graphics are rather pleasant although tyre smoke looks ghastly.  The best part of this game? Supercarts on Nordschleife.  Spend your money on a better racing sim such as Assetto Corsa.
3416	0	a	this game is not finished. about 30% of promised features are missing. bugs, which are there since day one (and before in alpha and beta stages of testing) and dont let you even start the game properly still exist, dispite we being told 'we're working on it'. and instead of fixing them so we can play, they concentrate on fixing graphic settings and other unimportant things. this game is still a beta version  FIX THE GAME FIRST, THEN OPTIMIZE IT.  AND FIX THIS GAME FIRST BEFORE YOU GO AROUND ASKING FOR MORE CROWDFUNDED MONEY FOR PCARS2. PCARS1 ISNT EVEN FINISHED.  dont the develepors have any shame left? this is just unacceptable..!!
3417	0	a	I have a hard time recommending this game at this point. Every single update that comes out may fix some issues, but breaks just as much. This game is not fit for public release at this point, even after multiple official patches. This latest patch refused to let me calibrate my wheel properly even after 3 consecutive tries. It's apparent that nobody quality tests these new releases on any platform. Car setups used to be OK, but even after fixing my wheel on the 4th attempt, they still feel like garbage. Any wheels off the track now result in penalties that slow your car down in the middle of the race making it dangerous for yourself and anybody around you. This is not racing. At this point, the game is a joke.  However, the biggest joke of all may be the limitless level of unprofessionalism displayed by Ian Bell, head of the studio on their official forums. His conduct is enough to make anybody sick to the stomach. Silence the criticism, act like an immature child and employ moderators who somehow manage to act even worse. Say anything negative about the product and find yourself banned or accused of being part of some conspiracy. Full disclosure, I have never registered or posted on the forums myself. I heard of this through words of mouth and then proceeded to spend hours going through their major threads until I just couldn't stand any more. I would certainly encourage anybody who doubts these claims to go to the official website yourself, or look up some great YouTube videos including screenshots of all of this. This is one person who will not pay another dime for any add-ons or sequels thanks almost entirely to the conduct of their leadership.  Beware when purchasing this game. Even if the bugs are eventually ironed out (and that will not be any time in the near future), you are supporting a studio who couldn't care less about what you think.
3418	0	a	A complete buggy mess. This game was released about a full year too early.
3419	0	a	A complete buggy mess. This game was released about a full year too early.
3420	0	a	This game looks beautiful and seems to have a lot of potential but feels very unfinished and unrefined. My biggest problem with this game is the drive-ability with game pads. I'm not a serious racing sim player and I use game pads to play games. I love console racing games like Forza and GranTurismo and I've been playing these games for years and I'm pretty good at it. So as a console racing game fan whose most comfortable with game pads, I found ProjectCars to be almost impossible to play competitively without crashing on every other corner. I spent many many hours adjusting the controller setup and even tried out many setups posted by other people on the forum but it was still very much unplayable. I have given up trying to play this game until the game developers can fix the controls so a casual player like me can actually enjoy playing this game.
3421	0	a	Grapchis are 10/10. Game is broken arcade with racing sim features. 
3422	0	a	Worse Game Ever. Out of all the reviews you will red most complain about the graphics. Graphics are very good in my opinion. The really bad point which no one seems to mention is the FFB. You cannot tell what the car is doing, The 14hours I have played this game is fiddling about the the settings for FFB, watching numerous You Tube videos and reading through forums to find some half acceptable FFB feeling to no avail. Stay Away from this game! You have been warned!
3423	0	a	Game is incredibly buggy and the bugs from Day 1(of this five year ordeal) still haven't been resolved. Devs are now working on a sequel as soon as the first one put some cash in their pockets and don't seem to be fixing the important bugs that break this game.  Yes, I have hours put in to this game, but I still wouldn't recommend people give their money to this type of developer. Had I known the game was this much of an unfinished mess I would have never bought it.
3424	0	a	Meh game. Disappoiting in nearly every way. It lacks the production value of other racers and feels pretty bare bones. There are better racing games out there.
3425	0	a	I will try to be as fair with my review as is fair selling this 'game' for 50€.  Pros   vehicle variety   graphics may be considered good   Cons   horrible physics - To all who think this is simulator, I can assure you it is not. You can change the actual car grip by mashing throttle and brake inside corner and the car won't slide at any speed, try going smoothly and you are off the track. Some kerbs (those that are on the outer side of a corner) will throw you outside the track, so does grass which is apparently made from glue. Some kerbs however are not a problem for the car and you can cut low speed corners in full speed without punishment. Crests don't work at all. Collisions do not work at all. You go side by side and if you touch you are stuck the the other car until you hit the barrier. On the other hand you can bump into cars in corners without punishment and that looks really funny.   horrible AI - they will keep crashing you on the inside in corners   horrible UI - you can not edit controls from race (only in main menu)   If I find something positive about this game I will update this review. But now it is UNFINISHED and overpriced product. I am pulling my hair out now for buying it, should have waited for F1 2015.
3426	0	a	not finished at all.... only really any good on nvidia and even then it still looks bad. the simplicity of a racer is gone, and its no sim, far too easy.... play AC and 'feel' the difference. the FFb is broken completely and i just dont trust the latency of the controls - something is wrong at the core. I cant beleive that 80,000 gamers helped develop this title, alls i can say is that they were Nvidia contributers and not AMD. But that argument aside its still a poor title. Im so sorry that a paid 39.99 for this, it kinda reminds me of Shift in many ways seems as buggy and just plain sticky. I like the fluidity of racers and visuals and/or waving crowds are not part of the equation, it seems that glitz overcame the glory. The benchmark for me is Gran Turismo - it felt right and looked pretty good (and was always well above the usual 30 fps even way way back) Polyphony always understood the need to get the game moving right before adding or not adding things that will get in the way of the drive. Yes you can turn things down but it doesnt add more detail /definition to the handling of the car, the saved resources are not then spent on the physics they are just omitted, the game still plays far too arcady. i dunno really it may be good for you but i much prefer AC, take a car around a track there and im sweating after, and spend time watvhing every bump and sway on a replay.   UPDATE - on finally getting it on win 10 with new 15.7.1 driver all seems well FPS wise, but it still looks really bad, it tears even with VSYNC (which i just dont get?) it all still looks jaggy, even in 2k with VSR - how is that possible. Then there are the crashes.... system crashes, same error (cant remember it) I turned down the 290x and still same issues.... ill keep with it though cos it cost me 39.99 but i wish i hadnt have bought it... FFb seems better now though, on a plus point - but its still far from finished, and i hear they are already making PC2, the money merry go round never stops it seems.... and i read somewhere this is Playstations most popular racing title? really??... i will be buying the PS4 only for Gran Turismo when released, we all need a new benchmark, i mean AC is good but i reckon GT will leave us all speechless....
3427	0	a	Project CARS funded this game back in days. DEVs told us this game will be something extra... not only graphics but handling too... They had alot of time to finish game. Repair Multiplayer lobby and all other parts of game. But all important things are still broken.   + Graphic   - FFB broken  - Online lobby is pain in ♥♥♥ - Game crash  
3428	0	a	  The graphics look amazing, the car models are very well made and the track list (and models) are amazing. Now the bad They announced a sequel before the game was fully released (I didn't have the game then but was hyped for this one) (Game was also in alpha or beta stage) F1 cars are buggy (Clip into eachother and you both spaz out or only one person spazes out) The AI is also bad (Smashes into you too frequently) When using a controller (I use a Xbox 360 controller) the controls just don't work well out of the box and you have to tweak them a lot.  Basically I'm saying buy Assetto Corsa (yes the AI is also bad)

3431	0	a	Offline: Bots intentionally crash into you  Online: Players intentionally crash into you
3432	0	a	Huge improvement over Shift, but the is no limit to these cars. It's literally impossible to over drive the car.
3433	0	a	(Edited after coming back from my initial anger)  I haven't played much at all but I am already very disappointed... The physics are a complete nonsense. I expected something arcade-ish like Shift2 without the 'on-off' behavior, but it's actually neither realistic nor fun. The same car will understeer like hell on a curve, won't understeer at all in the rest of the track, high-end racing cars grip like a 60's Chevrolet... Tracks feel narrow and simplified.  I noticed that passed a certain threshold, you simply have no control whatsoever when high-speed skidding during the first second, then get back in control when it's too late. I didn't identify the exact circumstances yet, The kerbs behave like ice blocks with some cars.   (Edit) - Now I realize that when you break a bit hard, the cars goes straight, even when the wheels aren't locked.... your controls have zero effect until you stop breaking. I must say I didn't use any assistance, so I guess you need to turn on the ABS to have a more realistic brake system. Whatever. The physics are just ridiculous, I wonder who can still think that a winged racing car will slip everywhere as soon as you move the wheel a bit quickly, even on a tiny amplitude and at high speed. (/Edit)  I expected much better graphic-wise. The graphics have clearly been optimized to look good during replays, or at spectacular times (dawn, rain). However, during normal plain-day racing, they are not that great.  The AI is worse than in Assetto Corsa, although very random in quality. The noise engines, claimed to be a huge step forward in some forums are not as realistic as in Assetto Corsa... The sound is not as good as in any other modern sim. There are scripted pops and noises when you leave the stands, while the engine at constant revv... The sound is flat and lacks seriously of complexity. I wonder how it could souns so good in the Youtube video comparisons between P. Cars and other games.  I expected it to be a good arcade-ish game to complete Asseto Corsa, but in the end, I do think it's not even as good as NFS Shift... less arcade and yet much, much less fun to drive (Ok if you choose the 4x4 of course, high-power 2WD cars were way too wonky in NFS).  Saw an article about all the hype being somewhat crafted. Actually, it does make sense: ten of thousands invested quite a lot in the game and are promoting it, flooding the forums, trying to get a bit of cash by multiplying videos on Youtube. Many of the comments are just hilarious when you realize how the game really is. However, the 'positive' wave is so overwhelming that it probably influences the judgement of many. I am looking forward for finding the first honest review on Youtube, by somebody who isn't afraid to be seen as a troll.  A bad game? No. Just every other car game I tried is more enjoyable. This one simply has no specific quality in any domain. And more importantly, the incredible hype has no justification whatsoever. If you want something more funky than Assetto Corsa, better go for the old classics, from the first Flatout to the olds NFS, GRID etc, even GTR2 (not arcade I know, but the races, especially over 24h, are still without equal; and it's not a such hard game). They are much more fun. This one feels dull, it's only vain noisy agitation. Even Test Drive Ferrari, despite its huge flaws, was more fun. I guess I'll wait for a career mode improvement in Assetto Corsa.  Uninstalling ASAP, as it takes a lot of my SSD. At least I can get this back, unlike my 50 Euros, due to my pre-purchase.
3434	0	a	After playing this so-called racing sim, I'm pretty disappointed from what I've experienced so far. If you are expecting this game to be great out of the box, you'll find it frustrating. If you have all the time in the world and are some racing geek who likes to spend all day tweaking rather than driving, then this game is for you being provided with many options. Especially with all the delays, I expected some finished product rather than relying on the user to achieve what should have been. Force feedback is awful without any tweaks and some RACING cars will feel like a boat! It reminded of me driving an early 80's cadillac. I'm no expert and have absolutely no experience behind these cars but do understand that it shouldn't feel like driving a floating boat!  I guess I don't have to mention about the awful AI but will remind you that it will ruin your game play most of the time, especially if you're not at pole position. No wonder this game have an achievement that rewards you to finish first after a crash in the first corner...lol.  If the developer decides to fix all this and provide us user with at least the base minimum at default, it would have been great as it does have the potential.
3435	0	a	I thought it was realistic, but slowly realised that the physics are a bit glitchy. I then went on to play assetto corsa again. Then I realised that I have waisted money and time on this game and should of been playing an actual sim.
3436	0	a	This game has so much potential to be great but with bad optimisation for AMD cards and the amount of issues the game still has after months of multiple delays I just can't recommend it just now.
3437	0	a	The game is....meh, First off the graphics are fantastic, Weather effects are awesome to and the car detail is absolutly insane. The AI in the game is pretty silly really and makes no sense. To me the gameplay is not great, random sliding and braking dosen't really do what it is supposed to. Overall I give the game a 5/10 which isn't good enough for a £40 game. Not worth the money to me.
3438	0	a	This game was sold on lies. It is NOT a simulator it is an Arcade Racer, and not a good one at that. Project Cars has one of the worst Physics systems in a car game I have ever played. I have seen some people compare it to Forza in terms of style but Forza is my favorate Racing game and this one is nowhere near as good of a simulator. The game just feels so flat and the cars compleatly unresponsive. It feels as though the devs just said, 'make it look as good as possable!' and then some lowley programer said 'but what about the oter sutff?' and they said back, 'meh...' Project cars looks amazing but the rest of the game is bad. Apart form the thigns I have allread memtioned, the sound desine is horrible. I have never hered worse engine noise in a game. I literaly sounds like it was phoned in.
3439	0	a	Overall - Comes no where near as good as Assetto Corsa.  Pros -   Nice weather effects  Easier to setup your own online race with friends than Assetto Corsa   Cons -   Its a sim wanna-be! Assetto Corsa does handling, sounds and driving feel way better.  Even the AI cannot stop the car in the wet or dry at the end of a lap causing it to crash and invalidate your lap time even after you run a perfect lap!!  No headlight reflection on the over the top shiny cars in the wet even when you are inches from the car in front.
3440	0	a	claims to have feel.. first game ever in racing i have felt literrally nothing,
3441	0	a	Pretty much unplayable on a top AMD card - wasted money, don't buy if you own an AMD GPU.  Not to mention a plethora of other bugs, such as facing backwards on a starting grid, AI not being affected by tyre wear and fuel, broken pit stops, getting stuck in pits during online qualification sessions and way more.
3442	0	a	Let me start out by saying that I never write negative reviews about anything, at least until now. Alright, so I've been waiting for this game for some time now. I've always enjoyed racing games, and I was excited that the PC was getting a big sim release. I started the game up and as soon as I started playing I ran into my first issue:   1. The game runs poorly on AMD cards (and some NVidia users have also complained). I understand one manufacturer having the advantage over the other in a specific game, but a 290x being outperformed by a 760? That's a bit insane. My setup is an i7 2700k @4.4Ghz and an R9 295x2 with a 2560x1440 monitor, and I had to turn the settings down to roughly medium/high just to get playable framerates (45+, it's not very stable).   Alright, so I managed. I was having some fun doing the online time trial, and I was excited to start my career the next day. So I got up, started the career in the Clio Cup, and something just felt off:  2. H-pattern shifting DOES NOT ALWAYS WORK. I figured this wouldn't be an issue, but apparently you're locked into using the exact transmission type that the car has. Yeah that's great and all, but what if I ENJOY using H-pattern? I personally hate flappy-paddle, and I can deal with sequential, but my Logitech G27 doesn't have a sequential option...  So those two reasons might not throw everyone off, but for me it's enough to say that I should have waited until there's a fix or at least an explanation for these issues. Is it a fun game? Sure, if you can deal with the flaws. However, the game currently feels unfinished, so I'd wait until the issues are fixed or wait for a price drop. I REALLY hope everything gets fixed though :/ . So maybe soon I'll change this review to a positive one!
3443	0	a	Possibly the single greatest example of bait and switch I've ever witnessed.
3444	0	a	Project sucks, physics are terrible just like FFB not worth your time. Fancy graphics dont make the game. Got bored in 20 min of gameplay lol back to Assetto Corsa 300Hrs + and still loads of fun. BTW that 1.2 hrs that it says i played 1 hr of it was messing with the FFB settings.
3445	0	a	I am Logitech G27 owner with some mods. After I got used to Assetto Corsa (after about 100+ hours), I couldn't get used to Project CARS physics. Mostly because of almost dead force feedback. Yeah, the SIMULATOR which doesn't have proper force feedback! It feels like you are driving on a totally flat road (except moments when you driving on track border or somewhere on grass/sand and wheel starts heavily knocking and except Nordschleife, where your car feels like jumping on the road) which sometimes feels too slippery on some surfaces. You have to be extremely alerted in order to catch the feel when your wheel is lighter/heavier and where it goes. In rain you have nearly no information, your car just go sideways if you are not really cautious. No other information is provided unlike Assetto Corsa where any bumps, camber, dips are felt and you can react on them accordingly.  Sometimes car setups are ridiculous and I don't understand people, who set Default Setups rule in multiplayer. F.e. setup on Renault Clio Cup with front and rear wheels toe-in set to 0.9 degrees. Seriously? Very stiff rear suspension on Toyota GT86 which makes her oversteery. Wat?  Graphics is sweet, however, night on some tracks looks awful. But I love rainy days, it looks pretty nice.  However, there are many other things that Assetto Corsa lacks as a proper simulator, f.e. night &amp; day transition, weather conditions, engine/oil/brakes temperatures (brakes temperatures were implemented with last patch to some cars in Assetto Corsa) and soft-body physics for cars, but even in Project CARS these things doesn't make any real sense. I never experienced my brakes overheating (on any car they get stronger when warmed up, but on typical sport cars it is kinda weird, they aren't supposed to handle such temperatures), never experienced engine blow driving with around 115 degrees on engine and 122 degrees on oil in endurance races.  So, If you are looking for a DRIVING SIMULATOR with a proper steering wheel, you'd better be looking for something else. I don't recommend this as a driving simulator but it is up to you to pick your poison.  UPD: Just in case if anyone will have a question why the hell I am still launching PCars and play sometimes if I do not recommend it. PCars has a little bit more content, better graphics and features that I like, but still it doesn't mean that I changed my mind about driving simulation. We're buying games to have fun and make use of it, aren't we?  And yeah, after last launch I had remembered one more thing - bad network code. People with bad connection or little bit of lags might ruin your race even if they didn't want to do this. Opponent's car can teleport right into you and launch you in the sky, chasing opponent can lag and punch you on braking point and happily continue to race pretending that nothing happened (which actually DID NOT happen to him and he just watches you running into a wall for no reason or because of 'small' tap in your rear). Since the AI isn't really good and I prefer to play with people this is a really frustrating thing for me. And there are a lot of bugs connected with network code like missing cars on replays, wrong colors, non-functional wheel after joining session, desync, black screen after load and etc.
3446	0	a	I'm going to fly in the face of opinion here and say PC is a disapointment. The content and graphics are nothing short of spectacular.   However, a driving game sinks or floats based on its physics engine and this really lets PC down. It is simply way too arcade-biased and suffers from myriad flaws that ultimately spoil the experience. A case in point is that the F1 cars are more benign in handling tems than the likes of the R500 and the Atom.   The sound is also very bad for some reason and sounds like it's been presented at very very low bit-rates.  If you love arcade racers, then jump in with confidence, but if you're looking for a sim, I'd look at Dirt Rally instead. It's a real shame because PC is the best looking driving game every produced and has raised the bar for other developers. If only they could have done the same with the physics model for the handling.
3447	0	a	12-18 fps in low-medium graphic settings, while Asetto Corsa runs 80fps in high? Sorry guys, this is a ♥♥♥♥, i cant enjoy. Optimalize it, and i will try again.
3448	0	a	Edit: Patch 7.0 has completely broken the force feedback on my DFGT making it impossible to race competitively. Constant sawing motion going around any corner. Weird thing is that it seems to work fine offline. Devs, please fix your game!   The game looks great, sounds great, handles..... on a controller it handles terribly still but it's better.   But the main flaw with this game is playing online. It's purely unacceptable the way cars bounce around the track due to poor servers. I can't recommend this game anymore. It's beautiful, there is no doubt about that but the online experience is so flawed. Having contacted the company and having no response is also very unprofessional. This is unfortunately an unfinished game and it looks like it will remain that way
3449	0	a	I bought this game to play it with my Oculus Rift DK2. I'm running this on a Corei5 4460 (4x3.2Ghz) and a Radeon 290X. Unfortunately I don't get the required 75fps for smooth VR gameplay even though I put all the graphics options to low. I'm running the most current Oculus Runtime and have up-to-date drivers. I blame this on the deep integration of Nvidia Gameworks in the title. Would not recommend th game and if I could get my money back I would.
3450	0	a	Dissapointing. The game is difficult, and realistic, but not right. Payed $60 for the Special Edition, week or two later, BUY THESE DLC's!!! ♥♥♥♥ off. I am so sick of these money grabs. The game is okay, but for some reason, could never truly enjoy it. Between crashes, bugs, and extremely over-complicated setup, you'd need to spend 10 hours configuring your driver settings so you don't spin out every five seconds. I even used a racing wheel and could not even get close to what it feels like to drive a real performance car.  The game looks great, but in reality, it's just a gag for money. Oh and Project cars 2 is coming... because this game is perfect?
3451	0	a	A perfect case of a waste of money.  Played this game at a friend's house, we were both huge forza fans before we switched to PC, game was fun so I picked it up on sale. Since my first race it has had a bug that will make it lag a few seconds, then go in fast forward to catch back up. Makes it completely unplayable. I really wanted it to work so I began searching for a fix. Tried everything I could find, even going into my bios and changing CPU settings that may have been causing it. Which they shouldn't anyway, since all of my 100+ other games worked completely fine with the cpu just the way it was. While in my trying to fix it (starting the game up, trying to do a race, still didn't fix it, try something else, still didn't fix it, etc.) I went over my two hours and am now stuck with it. Judging by how the forum posts of people having the same problem were from 7+ months ago, I'm sure it will never be fixed.  I really wanted to like the game, and when it works is so fun, almost better than my beloved forza days. However when the game goes into warp speed and sends me through a turn into a wall it outweighs the good. Another shining example of why early access is garbage. Why would they fix the game or make it work for everyone? They've already made their fortune.
3452	0	a	I spend more time messing about with the steering wheel settings than I do with the game to review this properly. Will update the review once I actually get to play the game for a little bit.
3453	0	a	I purchased this game for the linux version, which has been officially cancelled. the game is probably fine, but developers broken promises are not.
3454	0	a	♥♥♥♥ing garbage. Spinouts going 10kmh, ♥♥♥♥ chat ***'s out everything, amazing phyiscs.... Audi still broken on the Nurb, 7th gear still can't full accel or you will slip out... but he guys theres new content for you to spend some more money on, sorry haven't fixed ♥♥♥♥ yet, too busy milking me mother.
3455	0	a	Worst game physics ever , with any car even with traction control on you have uncontrollable wheel spin and the rumble strips are undrivable as they launch you of the track and same thing with touching a bit of the grass it just sucks you on to the grass seemed a lot worst with the karts and formulas all of this playing with an xbox controller that works fine with the f1 games i have . ive tried setting up the controller like in the forums helped a bit but i just think they've got it totally wrong with this game compared to real life racing
3456	0	a	UNPLAYABLE!  After waiting two days to download this game (I live in the countryside) I click 'Play', wait for all the initial start up messages to do what they do, and finally reach the first 'game' screen but then, I suddenly get an 'Unhandled Exception' ERROR and cannot proceed any further.   This is just unacceptable, (I understand this problem may be unique to my machine but I feel I should warn people just incase.)  If this problem becomes resolved, I will change my review.
3457	0	a	This game/sim does so much correctly, but the flaws are very ♥♥♥♥ing present. What you see here is a great game, plagued by the strangest design choices. When you are spinning out of control over and over in a 1 million dollar car, because you hit the throttle just a bit too furiously....that's not added realism; it's just utter ♥♥♥♥♥. This takes its toll when you are in lap 7 out of 7 and you see your first place quickly descend to a proper 23rd spot on the leaderboards ---&gt; there goes 15 min of intense racing. Again, this game is gorgeous. The few cars it contains feel real, until you start actually driving it. I'm not new to the racing sim genre, but yet again this is a game that manages to heavily overdo it on the 'realism' factor, making it far from it. All the factors in this game from starting out in go-karts to changing weather during races. Make this quite looker, but a good handful of cars are close to undriveable at a realistic level.  My pagani should do more than okay at 100km in a weak right turn, the actual result however is you spinning out and the competition is gone. Legit raging over a game very rarely occurs to me (a few times in my dark souls playthrough). This game manages to make it into a habit. I can't tell if I like this game or not, it does keep bringing me back in because of a lack of better racing games on pc. With Forza Horizon 3 on the way I'm very positive; but I'll probably never touch this game again :S   Conclusion: It has a ♥♥♥♥ ton of charm to it, but you'll run into so many excruciatingly frustrating moments.  (side note: really not that many cars to play around with, I understand licensing can be tough for an upcoming studio; my point still stands however)
3458	0	a	♥♥♥♥♥.
3459	0	a	Graphics are nice. Driving is fun. Everything else is crap. Menus are horrendous.   Controller setup is awful: you cannot choose which USB device is your controller, so you have to physically unplug all other peripherals to get your steering wheel to work..  Online racing is crap: Crashboxes are much bigger than the cars. The menu for an online session is severely lacking, and you cannot change course, cars or anything else while a session is started, forcing you to restart it over and over if playing with a friend and wanting to race another course or with another class of cars.  The options menu is not available in the game, so doing controller and graphics tweaks is an incredibly tedious process where you have to make an adjustment, start a race (with the included loading times), test, leave race (with loading times) open menu, tweak more... repeat ad nauseum.  If the core gameplay wasn't as good as it is, this would easily be one of the worst games I've played. Yet, with all its shortcomings, I can not recommend it until the dev get their ♥♥♥♥ together.
3460	0	a	I'm the saddest that I have to give a negative feedback to this game, because it could be by far the best racing game available.  In short: This game is unfinished and in its current shape, doesn't worth the price they ask for it, and will be soon replaced by Project CARS 2 anyway.  The physics are great. The graphics are beyond anything I've saw before, Each car has its own unique characteristics. Each track is different, ther are a lot of them, you can try anything from karting dromes to coastal roads of France. The car pool is not the biggest, but definitely impressif from go-karts to roadcars, super sportcars, Formula cars and LMP-1 racecars.  Why is Project CARS is still a bad game? Because it is unfinished. It has some bugs, that could be excused for a freshly released game, but it jsut cries out loud that there were areas which were completely dropped during the development. What am I talking about?  1)OPTIMALIZATION The game is basically unplayable unless you have an nVidia card. Any ATI GPU and you're done for. I'm lucky, but many others are not.  2) CUSTOMIZATION There are a fixed amount of possible liveries, but they have no connection with teams or anything. Basically you can run any livery you want. Meanwhile you can not choose or edit your own helmet or driver suit. The game will choose one for you for every race. So even during a championship you will most likely drive in different helmets and suits, even though they may not even match your car's livery.  3) CAREER It cries out how much they wanted to put into this one. For instance, when you start your career, you have to pick your nationality and favorite number. That's great but they are never ever used in the future. You'll never hear your national anthem, you'll never see your flag. And as I already said, you choose from a pool of preset car liveries which have fixed numbers on them so unless you find a livery with your favorite number on it, you will never race with the number you have picked. The whole career is flat and pointless anyway. Basically you win races to be invited to other races where you have to win again to get some more invitations. End of story. It is shallow, uninspired and has no point whatsoever. There are a whole set of drivers and teams for any level of your career form karts to LMP-1, but all the drivers and all the teams have the exact same abilities. There is no better or worse driver or team. Heck, they don't even have their own livery, they just randomly pick one form the livery pool. So basically there is no point in switching teams in the same championship, because there are no 'better teams' who could help your career more.  5) NO AMERICAN RACING The game totally lacks American-style racing. There is not a single oval track, not to mention championships. There are only tow signs that they were planning to add them as well. The first is that there is a NASCAR-type car you can drive, although I didn't find any race during the career they would be used. And there is a 'Coming soon' section of the career mode where presumably the oval races should have been...  4) AI Oh, my gosh, where should I start? This is by far the worst and the most unacceptable part of the game. The AI is not affected by tyre wear, tyre temperature, brake temperature, track temperature, mechanical failures, rain, trackside objects (kerbs, grass, sand, gravel) basically anything that would make your life harder. It's the worst during long races when you must concentrate on saving your engine, brakes and tyres while the AI can push as hard as it wishes. In the rain the AI loses maybe half a second per lap. Heck, sometimes AI is even faster in the rain than it is on dry! Did I mention that AI cars are almost like concrete blocks? They have no problem ramming into you and you'll fly off the track into the wall, but should you touch them.... you fly off into the wall. Oh and in every single-make championship AI strength is totally randomized, so basically anything except the LMP and GT series is a mess, you can easily win the championship without actually winning a single race.  6) THERE IS NO SUPPORT Sine the release of the game, the developers are basically disappeared and they barely help those who have issues with the game. Even worse, they are already talking about Project CARS 2. Previously, they said that the game is a platform they intend to constantly expand and develop, so if you buy the game, it will be a long-time investment. Staff members already said on the official forum that the game will get a mere 2 years support and in 2017 Project CARS 2 would be released.  So do not pay for this game. It is unfinished, and not the game we have expected it to be. Its technical support will be suspended soon anyway, so my suggestion is to play whatever simulator you already have and wait for Project CARS 2, which hopefully will make us forget this game..
3461	0	a	It's sad to say, but ProjectCARS stays way behind the expectations which WMD raised during the years of development. A racing simulation to me is above all about the grade of immersion it delivers. There are many positive or even extraordinary features like the graphical representation, the number and quality of tracks, the amount of available cars, the time and weather effects, animated spectators ... you name it! But all these features are oblivious, if you don't get the feeling to really drive a race car. The fact, that to this day it is not possible to properly use a Fanatec Porsche GT3 v2 wheel, is not the reason for my negative review; I suppose, the issue will be resolved sooner or later. It seemed to be of more importance to support PS4 and X-Box. What really bothers me is, that the game's FFB quality is outright unacceptable! The myriad of weird undocumented ffb-settings are agonizing, the grip levels are strange at best, not being able to save individual car setups is a sad joke! I am very disappointed, that SMS diverged from their initial path at a very late stage of development and drifted towards some kind of good looking arcade race game. And that's what ProjectCARS finally turned out to be: a pretty good looking arcade title for your living room console ... and that's not for me!
3462	0	a	1) This game isn't very optimized. A lot of screen tearing at 50 to 60 fps?! why I don't get that in any other games.   2) Online not working. All lobbies are empty. Just a ghost town.   3) Game menu is terrible. Cant find most important things, headache to get used to.   People say Asseto corsa is better, might be better optimized and was half price too. But promotion ended. This game is a mistake.   _I have an NVIDIA card btw. not even poorly optimized AMD card._  I willing to Trade this game!! just so you know.
3463	0	a	Beautiful game with great playability, but a serious and ridiculous show stopper of a bug causes it to insta-shutdown on my PC. The head of the game development studio is extremely rude and argumentative with people reporting bugs, leading to the impression (the correct impression) that he doesn't give a crap about customers.   Painful customer service in a complex and unfinished game. Pretty kickstarteresque.
3464	0	a	Project Cars could have become a real nice racing sim. Instead it went the way of pure action driving like the Need For Speed series.  Damage? - not existing, crash at 200 into a wall and then just ricochet back into the track, allows for awesome advantages in lap times; Tire-physics? Claimed to be there but at such a bugged (yes, I write this after release!) level that you wonder what happens. Sometimes you even wont need to drive to heaten up your tires (and thats magical when the tires are getting warmer than the surrounding while standing still);  If you dare to drive a street car with show oil-temperature (like the m235i) you wonder how f****ing high you can get the RPMs and still have the temperature sub optimum - in reality the m235i is quite fast at its optimim level as all the electronics and cooling systems are programmed to reach that as fast as possible and then hold it. I wont even come to the 'handling' of it. I've driven the m235i in real - on and off track - and I have no clue what the programmers though when they did its physical model. Its not realistic, more a sarcastic approach to mime a random car behaviour.   If you want brainless action where u can bump into walls and easily push opponents of the track -get this game. If you want a racing sim, move on and leave the store page asap.  For me the game was a complete waste in money as its neither realistic tracks nor realistic cars - just a mere unfinished product where your automatically driven out of the pit area (yes right - you *cant* drive yoursel, a magic hand will do that) and miss nearly all real rules a race would have.  From a 'functions' perspective this game is even inferiour to the 97's 3dfx Formula 1 - at that time real physics was not easy possible, but at least they implementec the basic racing rules like pit stops, starts (standing + flying where you are in full control of the car prior to green!); 
3465	0	a	Single player is unplayable thanks to the terrible AI and completely stupid contact physics. A slight bump flips your car. Not fun, not realistic, not worth my money.
3466	0	a	Not a lot of cars.
3467	0	a	As of patch 1.4, still unplayable on AMD gfx. will not play again until Windows 10 is out.  in 20 hours of game time, I've had the unhandled exception access_violation crash to desktop 241 times. no official fix on it, just time consuming 'fixes' that never changed anything
3468	0	a	The AI are too aggressive, they do not try to race, they try to kill you. I get pushed off the track by AI and I get a penalty for cutting a corner? and when I lose 6 places? Thats just stupid.
3469	0	a	the game aint starting anymore please give me back my money
3470	0	a	There could be a lot to love about this game, for somebody else. I find it infuriating.
3471	0	a	average looking car game, but there is no feeling of speed. I find myself spending more time tuning the car than actually driving. Over hyped.
3472	0	a	Using a controller? Want to crash into dirt and walls every 3 seconds? Buy this game, it's for you!

3474	0	a	I began sim racing in 1996 at 31 and you would think that after all of these years that game makers would start taking notice of what the long term gamers are doing and what hardware and equipement they are running, but still to this day only 3 of the game makers (Racing Games) cut the mustard. The rest will need to make huge inprovements in order to escape the realm of kiddies game makers. I run both rFactor 1 and 2 and also Assetto Corsa, I don't like iRacing but that is more of a personal issue rather than about the game itself. These games are the only racing games to date that cater for hardline sim racers, they cater in everyway for every sim setup whether VR, Multi Screen, single screen, cockpit etc. All the rest are merely glorified console versions which cater for single screen and occasionally VR. They will never be regarded as true simulations because they do not cater for the 10% of us that build or buy multi screen cockpits for ourselves. Today I purchased and installed Project cars and all associated packs. I immediately liked the clarity of the image, very good indeed. But was put off straight away by a very poor and primitave User Interface. I am in a homemade cockpit with 3 x 27' monitors running 5760x1080 resolution, these monitors are in a fixed position with a roof over them for a better sense of imertion. The left bezel of the left monitor and right bezel of the right monitor reach back at 45 degrees from the centre monitor to just behind my ears giving me a realistic drivers seat view. Project cars supports as many monitors as you like but they must be run side by side in a straight widescreen line with no more than a couple of degrees of angle, so basically it is stretching 2400 x 1080 res over my 3 monitors with some horrible stretching and incorrect angles going on to the left and right monitors. This basically makes the game unplayable to anyone used to multiview. So before buying this game take in to account that it is not directed at the hardline gaming community it is a childrens game for laptops or single screens, in short it is nothing but a 1990's arcade game with pretty pictures. The cars have a very arcade feel to them even with all driving aids turned off. So, don't waste your money if it's games like rFactor, Assetto Corsa or iRacing that get your rocks off because this is nothing more than Grid with a different user interface although just as bad of an interface. Now I must attempt yet another refund from Steam for yet another childrens game. If it supported multiview I could get used to it for nights when I am tired and want an easy drive, but in its current state it is useless
3475	0	a	Now I Race in real life and I have to say that every racing game is still hard for me but this game takes that to a new level I only played for about 1 and a half hours and i can tell you if you don't understand the heel pressure, Break pressure, and esc. even a little leave this game alone. This is definitely a hardcore racing game if you want to drift they may has well made the car tell you 'are you crazy drifting in a car!'. But there is some good parts unless hardcore is good for you THE GRAPHICS ARE AMAZING but with good graphics comes issues like RUBBER BANDING, and tremendous lag!!!! My computer doesn't have a bad a graphics card its actually pretty good its a nividia 700 series and i run the game on all medium so to me this is unacceptable. 5/10
3476	0	a	Remember this game is really not a sim. It's a cross between a sim and a arcade game. It's like something between a real simulator like Assetto Corsa and a arcade game like Drive Club. Most tracks are not laser scanned and the FFB (Force Feedback) will not be as good as Assetto Corsa.  It is still a very enjoyable game. Developer will have to really do something to fabricate some artistic licensed FFB on those tracks without FFB to really make the game kick for those who are simulator fans and owns a set of steering wheels.  I must say I bought this game for the weather effect which Assetto Corsa do not have. I am loving the weather engine ... every moment of it. So if you are looking for pure simulator as advertised ... don't be fooled it's not, and may never be.  AMD cards owner currently seems to have issue with frame rate issue during AI matches, especially ones with too many cars involved. The frame rate drop is so drastic it's not worth AMD card owner to get the game until it's resolved. I am using a single nvidia GTX970 Asus with not much issues.  The user interface could have been better design. It seems the beta ones looks better than the released version. Current one is difficult to use especially selecting the car's skin can be tricky business. Others including tuning setup of vehicle has no graphical representations , eg graphs or charts ... all numbers. Given the time they spend on development and a few major shifts in release date , it's quite dissappointing.  The focus quite alot on the career side of things. However you cant buy or buy parts to upgrade your cars, or keep a garage of cars which are made and tuned by you. You could however saves tuning setups on the stock models to load them up later. Which is very limiting for the arcadie side of the game.  The multiplayer side of things is strange as well. The server searches for games in your region as defined by steam. So america players will see servers in america, and uk players only the uk ones. So for region with little players you have to literally change your region on steam setting to get into a region with populated servers to play in.  So ... here's my take on Project CARS.  If you really wanna experience a good sims I would say Assetto Corsa still does it better, it just doesn't rain in AC's world.
3477	0	a	This is a hard one.   Project Cars is possibly the greatest Racing Sim I've ever played. Graphically amazing. Completely unforgiving physics that makes you feel like a pro when you get it right. But...  The online play is HORRIBLE!!! I'm putting it down to poor servers, as the lag is ridiculous! Also, there needs to be some kind of player racking system to create game filters, as some drivers just ram others off the road and receive no punishment for it, when others take racing seriously. Which is what this game is, a serious sim for serious racers.  SMS, sort this game out and I'll recommend it happily!
3478	0	a	This game would be amazing if it were actually finished yet. Too many bugs to mention - some game breaking, some are minor but extremely annoying. The AI is an abomination. At higher difficulties the opponents are extremely agressive. Above 85% it's practically a bloodbath. Below that you can zoom by the entire pack at the start of the race and finish with a 10 second gap to 2nd. Very disappointing.  Hopefully Ian Bell can get it together and actually finish this game because I think it would be fun to play if it were properly done.
3479	0	a	Don't waste you $$$...
3480	0	a	I cannot recommend this game, be it for VR or not. If you've played racing simulators like NFS Shift 2, or Forza, then you'll be in for a disappointing shock with Project Cars.   The graphics are sub par despite what the pretty screenshots look like, and yes, I have a powerful enough PC to run this smoothly at its highest settings. But I can live with that. The deal breaker for me is the driving mechanics. It's as if the game has very poor or limited driving physics simulation as the cars do not react the way a real car would when turning, especially at sharp corners, it's noticeable and completely breaks the immersion.  So unfortunately I cannot recommend the game.
3481	0	a	Truly brilliant if you never mod it. Try to change anything and it breaks. The developers are not helpful, and the website is far from the best. The gameplay is good, but looks a little slow even when your doing 60 at 299fps. Far from fully satisfied. Good basis, but their already moving to pCars 2. This one isn't even finished.
3482	0	a	Wow, game came out a month ago and pit stops still don't work. I also love they are looking for money for the next version. I'm getting a refund.
3483	0	a	Is it a good racing game? Yes.  Does it feature a good selection of cars and tracks? Yes, kind of limited but good none the less.  Is it realistic? Kind of, but there are better and more realistic racing sims.  Would I recommend it? NO.   It may be a fun game to play, but I can not support Slightly Mad Studios' crowd-funded creation, the reason being that they already have another crowd-funded creation in the production process. They've released an unfinished product that still needs a lot of work to be a strong contender in the genre of racing sims, but they see more profits in releasing their next ♥♥♥♥♥♥ unfinished product.   If you're looking for a good racing sim, you're better off buying Assetto Corsa, rfactor, Game Stock Car or basically any other game in the genre.   If you're after a 'serious' kind of half-sim this would be a good game, but I still can't recommend it. Do not only yourself a favour, do the entire community of racing sim players a favour by not buying, and supporting, studios like these. 
3484	0	a	Project Cars is a solid racing simulator, although it loses its 'new car smell' relatively quickly. I had been waiting for this game for a long time, and now that I've played it, I can't say it was 100% worth the anticipation. What throws me off early on in the game is the ridiculous amount of time they force you to race go-karts for before you can start racing real vehicles. I spent a solid 5 hours working through two full seasons of go-kart races before I was able to move up to an actual car. Also, I prefer having to earn and save money to go and buy the car I want like in Gran Turismo or Forza, but with Project Cars there is no money system, and your rewards for winning races comes in the form of racing team contract offers which net you a new car to race with. Don't expect any visual customizing either, aside from preset paint schemes.  Its a good game with a good selection of tracks and cars, but it lacks the refinement and small details that other racing games have gotten right in the past (the surprisingly low resolution images of each vehicle when you are picking out the car you want to race with in Free Mode and the non-controllable, PAINFULLY slow panning camera when you want to look at the actual vehicles come to mind).  You will most likely enjoy the game if you are into racing games, but don't expect to get the same 200-300 hours out of it like you did with Gran Turismo back in the day.  Update: Game crashes every 10 min or less. For some reason I was able to play the first 6 hours with only one or two crashes, but now I can't make it through a single race without it freezing up. I probably won't be buying Project Cars 2, and its offensive that you would start developing a new game before the first one is completely stable. One more customer lost.
3485	0	a	I honestly feel like I was robbed. This game has the worst handling I've ever encountered. the cars grip and suspension physics are just trash. The only bright side about it are the accurate sounds, which occasionally are broken. Don't buy this game if you're looking for a Forza or Grand Turismo equivelant.
3486	0	a	I'll admit, this is a 50/50 decision for me, I wouldn't say it is a game you should avoid like the plague, but I could never fully recommend someone to buy this game.   The positives: The track selection in this game is very good! I think it covers a great variety of countries and locations. I also think there is a good enough car selection (If anything, a few more would be great).  The main plus point of this game is the graphics. This is a stunning game and they have got the track detail bang on. I have been to Oulton Park and I can safely say they have got it spot on. The cars are incredibly detailed and look wonderful.  The negatives: This game is buggy as hell! The amount of times I have had to restart the game because the top left of the screen has gone black is stupid. The menus have stopped working for me a number of times and the force feedback settings for my wheel have compeltely broken (With an alaming knocking feeling coming through the wheel a number of times). The online gameplay is horrible! I've played a number of hours against friends and I've disconnected (On a solid internet connection), had the game crash and had settings been randomly changed.  There is a complete lack of a working penalty system. Sure the game will punish you for cutting corners and track extending (Within reason), but if you t-bone someone online at the first corner, the chances of you getting disqualified are random, sometimes you will, sometimes you won't.   My final issue with the game is the physics. I play this game with a force feedback steering wheel, but it just doesn't feel realistic, which makes the driving stupidly frustrating.  OVERALL VERDICT This game just doesn't feel finished. The fact they have released a game of the year edition adds salt to the wound, as this is by no means a great game. Parts of the game don't work and driving in this game is not enjoyable at all. However, it looks great, there are some good tracks and has a decent career mode.   I wouldn't recommend this game to a casual gamer but only to someone who is a die hard racing game fan like myself.
3487	0	a	This game is not the simulation it aspires or gives claim to be. The way it simulates wheel friction and wheel load is just very off, appallingly off. Common driving techniques such as countersteering, weight shifting or drifting is not possible in this game.  I am an old time drving enthusiast and game physics coder and from what I can gather testing various things this game do not simulate slip angle of tyres. It's completly disregarding asymptotic friction and just apply wheel torque in the direction of travel of the wheel.   As a result you can do infinity donuts in this game just holding down the accelerator after initiating a spin. That is something that just doesn't happen in real life, nor anything that happens in other racing games claiming the 'simulation' label.
3488	0	a	This game had so much potential, but sadly falls very short of the mark. Firsty there is the frankly comedic collision physics in which a slight rub turns into wheels leaving the floor and a potential roll. Secondly the absolutely ridiculous AI, who will ram you off track during qualifying, meaning you will receive a very harsh penalty for leaving the track, sometimes invalidating your current and next lap. To sum it up, every race is a clusterf*ck and if the ridiculous AI do not ruin your race, the comedic collision physics will. I paid £22 for this, and am annoyed, if I had paid full price I would be livid.
3489	0	a	Really disappointed in this purchase. Simply put the game is just incomplete, both in content and QA testing. To sum up my experience below, it's a 6/10 game. Outside of graphics, there isn't one thing it does great, or even better than other options out there. I would say casual race fans looking for a 'sim-light' experience should pick it up on sale, but the game breaking bugs make me hesitant to do even that. Look for one of the many better, cheaper games available for sale.   Visually it's quite nice, and although it doesn't quite compare to the previews, it still looks better than pretty much any racing game out there. However there are several graphical glitches that still need to be worked out. Most that I've experienced have been cosmetic, but one seems to cause the framerate to speed up after breaking . It messes with the physics and throws your car off the track. It's hard to describe: the framerate is still smooth, but it's like your car suddenly has a jet strapped to it for a few seconds. I have a pretty beefy rig and didn't have this problem when I first started playing, so I don't know what's causing it. It only happens in the rain so I'm unable to race in what is supposed to be one of this game's big selling points: its dynamic weather (which otherwise looks great and the ability to set multiple weather conditions during a single session is awesome).   Additionally, there are a plethora of other bugs relating to the gameplay itself, but are far too numerous to list here. You can even find an acknowledgment of several specific bugs from the developers themselves, though even those are a fraction of the whole.   The user interface is horrible, and I can't think of anything positive to say about it other than at least the text is crisp and clean. I thought Codemasters had horrible menus, but I had no idea. Everything is counter intuitive and buried in pages upon pages, to the point where changing your vehicle's livery is an adventure.   If you're planning on using a controller with this game just forget about it. I have no idea how anybody could control it with a standard Xbox controller or Dualshock. Using my Logitech G27 wheel has been fine, but the force feedback leaves a lot to be desired. I swear I spent more time reading through pages and pages of forum posts and guides on how to fix the FFB model in this game, rather than playing the game itself. There are a lot of customization options, but most are beyond your average user. When I bought this game I didn't think I was enrolling in a course on the finer points of FFB tuning/modeling, but that's what I was forced to sit through. Even then it wasn't enough. Many have just downloaded mods to improve the FFB. Bottom line is that it doesn't work well out of the box after calibration.   The driving model itself is ok (think an improved version of Need for Speed Shift), and depends on the car. This isn't close to the sim its been advertised as, but that doesn't mean it's poor or that you can't enjoy yourself. Most of my time was spent with open wheel racers, and I felt that the lower class formula cars were really fun and felt good. I tried to work my way through career mode but unfortunately the karting is atrocious. If you set the camera to follow behind, you can actually see them unnaturally gliding over the surface of the track, like some kind of buggy hovercraft.   The reason I finally shelved this game was because of the hyper aggressive AI. Now I don't think ANY single player racing game has nailed the AI, but at least they didn't ruin the races. Anything under 80% was too slow, and anything above was like racing your friend in Gran Turismo back in the day. They just slam into you constantly through corners, totally ruining any chance of a race. After I got into the grove with the Formula Rookie cars, I started a new career from that level and was finally having fun. However I soon got to Sonoma and the AI made turn 1 impossible. Every single time I took the turn an AI car slammed into me, throwing me off the track. I restarted the race no less than 18 times. It happened again, and again, and again. The last time I just sat on the track spun out sideways, blocking another AI driver to see what would happen. After about 30 seconds of just sitting there, he decided to ram into me and physically push me out of the way. DIdn't even try to go around. That was it for me with Project Cars until the developer does some serious work.   There are other issues with the accuracy of feedback from the community (I bought this game in part because of content supposedly on its way, but turns out it was just backers with a financial interest meaning that 'they have faith the developer will add the features), the developers willingness to listen to feedback, their intent to fix issues, and the typical DLC/funding nonsense (we were supposed to get a free car each month... so far only paid DLC packs and an announcement of the sequel's funding campaign(, but this review has gone on long enough and you can find all of that with a simnple Google search.
3490	0	a	This game at first looks great. However, looks can be deceiving. Project Cars seems to be riddled with bugs. The game regularly crashes. I would definitely not recommend you buy this game right now
3491	0	a	Handling physics are an absoulte garbage for a game released in 2015 .  Al still hasn't ben fixed. Developer is a huge crybaby deleting negative comments about this game and banning users from forums. They promised new cars every month - HUGE LIARS! Can't complain about graphics. They're amazing.  5.5/10. Sentence - Tag Simulatoin should be changed to Arcade
3492	0	a	The gameplay for project cars is fantastic, the cars feel great, good sounds, decent graphics. While all of this is good, when I went to play online there were only 2 games found and only one of which actually had more than 1 player in it. If you hope to play online, forget it, there's hardly anyone playing and its only a week old.  As for single player, it just seems like they threw it together last second. You can start from pretty much anywhere you want, with unexciting results for finishing races. There are no rewards, nothing.   Dissapointing  Pros - Graphics (sometimes, only really impressive if raining) - Gameplay - Sound  Con  - Just about everything else
3493	0	a	The game was buggy as hell, the sound broke constantly and the car selection was extremely limited.  I had the left steering bug and it ruined the game.
3494	0	a	I wish I could recommend this game but my big problem is the shifting. I am using a wheel and stick shift sometimes it works sometimes it doesnt and I cant figure out why. Why not build in some presets for some more wheels with shifting units. For me the game is unplayable without making the shifting automatic or using a controller and thats no way to play a driving game.
3495	0	a	Negative review untill they fix the dam' xbox360 controller stability
3496	0	a	VERY POOR OCULUS DK2 SUPPORT  sorry but if it says it supports it then it should work I understand it the oculus requires being a bit creative at times to get it to work but with not menu support and not being able to get the game to show correctly at all on the headset it wasn't even worth the £23.99 sale price   as for the game its self I thin you need a full steering wheal setup as the Xbox control is very bad even after playing around with the settings the cars are just out of control and im a big GT and AC fan  the upside is my money was refunded but not to my bank account so thanks for nothing steam you really do have my money so much for a refund policy!  
3497	0	a	This is a very good game and has a great career mode. I love the features of the pit engineers and how the games is so vastly customisable. The physics are ok however with some improvements they can become as good as the physics of assetto corsa. The biggest problem for me is the ai or the computer drivers. They remind me completely of the original drivers in assetto corsa but with updates that game was mastered. The ai have no sense of the other drivers and are happy to smash into you and dont give way to let you overtake. They then crash into you you flip end up in 16th and are either out of the race or your car is in such bad condition you have no chance of catching up. In my opinion i dont want to have a rewind feature like forza does however if the ai are going to stay as they are you find yourself having to restart the race and then the same happens. I have spent up to 45 minutes trying to complete a race without being crashed into and forced to restart if i want to have any chance of winning the race. This game was hugely anticipated but it doesnt meet the excitement that it betrayed. To me Project Cars is in beta and feels like a very much incomplete game. With a few fairly major improvements the game can be fantastic and better than its rivals of Forza and Assetto Corsa. I would recommend buying this game even though their is a few major problems I think the developers will improve these features if they want to stand of chance of becoming worth the hefty £40 price tag. The reason I have given a Thumbs down simply relates to the price. £40 for a game that in my opinion is worth £25 maximum. Many may not agree but after playing for around 10 hours i seem to find myself aimlessly starting a race getting crashed into then pressing restart, on a constant loop.
3498	0	a	The game is still in beta as far as I'm concerned. Don't bother complaining on the official forum either; criticism of any kind will not be tolerated (as per the official instructions of Ian Bell, head of SMS) and if you do you will get banned from the site (just as I've been).   Here's a very small preview of he known bugs (patch 1.4)   - when I leave the pits and I tell my crew to not refuel or change my tyres they still fill my tank up and give me tyres that overheat from the first corner (yes there is a bug within a bug, we're through the looking glass people).   - In replays debris from previous sessions are shown and opponents' cars change into different models.  - In sector 3 of road America the split times of the cars is broken and will show you timings that are minutes out.  - There is also an invisible wall that will very rarely and randomly appear on the start finish straight of road America. Hitting this wall at racing speeds is all but guaranteed to end your race. (Has not happened to me directly but I have been in a session where my friend's car suddenly stopped and said he had hit an invisible wall)  - A.I cars do now actually pit in wet conditions, but they often do it too early while it is just beginning to drizzle and when it does turn into a full on storm they won't pit again to change from intermediates to rain tyres.   - A.I drivers occasionally fail to do mandatory pit stops in races or leave it until the last lap (doing so reduces the time lost in the pits)  - FFB will occasionally run into issues ranging from minor (lack of feedback in the wheel) to game braking (wheel will forcefully turn itself to full lock, even when cars are in perfect condition) requiring me to turn off and on my wheel, or in rarer occasions I will have to restart the PC (does not happen with Assetto Corsa)  - When joining a MP session that has already started and is in practice/qualifying mode you can occasionally be stuck in your pits unable to go to track. You can also join a lobby and be stuck there unable to join the session.  I'm sure there are more that I have forgotten about (that have happened to me or that I've witnessed in game) but I've made my point. Not all of these are game breaking but all of them are capable of ruining a race/session.   I also haven't even begun to talk about the non-bug related issues.   When it works though (which is 30% of the time) it's probably the best racing game money can buy.
3499	0	a	When maxed out the game is beautiful. But at that point you just stare at it, don't race, don't even move your car. I paid fill price and quite honestly have no idea why. I have 980's and i can't max this game out, and even when i do moving in a race whether maxed out or playing optimal nvidia settings i still either way lag out, get choppy and its just a painful experience. About to drop the setting even further but at this point i scratch my head if the console version is this buggy. Just like all of BANDAI Namco games you get all the BS of buggyness. I thought this would be the end all of racing games for me but i just might pickup a xbox one and buy forza because at least that game is beautiful and plays beautiful. And at this point its a game i feel i need 4 980 TI's and still couldn't run it smooth.
3500	0	a	WARNING DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME: Career mode is absolutly terrible as you will no doubt rage quit due to the ai that will literally crash you off the track.  Realism - basically an arcade racer, dont think about even coming close to certain curbs as you will just spin out even if you only put your front wheels on the curb the rear will spin around, secondly the ai manage to go over the curbs like their nothing, i follow the ai for hours figureing out how they did it. However if you carry the same amount speed they do, you will spin out, making it impossible to overtake on certain areas. This game cannot compare to the likes of rfacter and iracing, with realism. However this is one of the few semi realistic games that offer a career mode which is a plus, also the graphics are quiet good compared to other racing games otherwise its a piece of ♥♥♥♥ compared to what is already out there.
3501	0	a	I instantly regretted buy it the second I both it, I got a feeling it’s going to be ♥♥♥♥. Well what is it? It’s NOT a SIM, but I knew that before but hype train will say it is. It’s a simcade just like GRID was It is also an evolution of NFS:Shift and with that come “great AI.  MENU/HUD – If you like Windows 8 you will love it if you are like me you will hate it, buttons in menu are so bit the biggest I think is 856x570px. It’s ridicules… In fact they are so big they have to split menu in to 2 screens… Hud is good enough you have limited option for positioning and look and you can save it… but game will never remember that in fact you will have to change the hud every time you pick a new race. It’s like the game is saying “you like that setting do you huh? Well ♥♥♥♥ you I’m going back to default.  CARS/ TRACKS – for the budget they have lineup of cars is disappointing, very disappointing (get ready for a ton of DLC…). No lesser scan track, it’s not a ♥♥♥♥ ton of them but it’s ok choice, but It’s nothing special.  AI – Eh… well it’s better than NFS:Shift they will not crash to your ♥♥♥ before the corner a least, but if you collide with them it’s the end AI and you will be glue together for the end of time unless something magical happen and you will be free. So basically when it’s working it’s good but when it’s not its the worst AI ever.  GRAPHIC – is great it’s not like the videos and scenes before release but that was expected… AMD user will have ♥♥♥♥ time in races where FPS will drop massively, and they will rise when you will be driving alone. Devs will say oh because AMD wasn’t interesting in helping us… REALLY?! Sure let’s just slap NVIDIA logo everywhere because they didn’t pay us or anything…  GAMEPLAY – Some cars handle better than others but overall it’s meh as I remember correctly GRID is better. WEATHER EFFECTS! Why oh why devs don’t make them I’m looking at you Kunos… Rain looks… I don’t like it does not look realistic and it’s definitely not realistic to drive in it.  So overall it’s ok nothing special but sometimes you can smell that NFS:SHIFT stench and it’s not nice. I will never recommend an ok game for THAT price!  Sorry for my engl... nah ♥♥♥♥ off.
3502	0	a	I wanted to love Project Cars but the physics are nothing special, AI is really weird and it doesn't run well even on a 780 Ti. (at reasonable settings @1080p) plus.. It's not fun. It's just not fun. In the words of Jeremy Clarkson: 'It’s a bit too clinical' This is more like an engineer's game. Sure, it's EXTREMELY pretty and all but.. it's just not fun.  Plus they cut a lot of features and there are tons of bugs left.  Oh and, no Honda S2000. I MEAN, COME ON.
3503	0	a	I have about 112 games in my library. Also have a Vive. This is the first game I have ever refunded. The graphics, as others have said, are great. I just got really frustrated. Felt like driving on glass, endless spinouts. Maybe I'm just not a good driver but the constant crashing and system freezes didn't lend themselves to gaining experience. No other games freeze or lock my PC like this. It was cool trying on the Vive and is quite an experience. I may come back to this if it gets some patching and stability and a lot of work on vehicle and driving physics. As it is though it just isn't worth it to me. Im going to go buy DOOM for theater mode.
3504	0	a	This game is still in early access !  Tons of bugs ! Good graphics ! Tons of bugs ! Good sounds ! Tons of bugs ! Bad career mod ! Tons of bugs !   If you get a wheel : move on !!!  The game is unplayable at its current state (1.4) cause the FFB is buggy and glitchy since I have reset my settings and tried to calibrate my wheel again.  The devs don't even care about it.   See the devs politic : Instead of fixing the FFB which the majority thinks it sucks, they're expecting us, to tweak the FFB with third party files. There is a 'sticky' on their forum about it when it should be directly in the game.  I have a lot of games and this is my very first review because i'm mad that I haven't been able to play the game properly since 10 days.    Much love to Asseto Corsa and iRacing, games that are taken care of....
3505	0	a	It doesn't quite work as a product.  It lets you navigate the menus with one xbox controller, but only drive with another. For me it crashes in the second corner of the second track in career mode. Consistently.   Ammendment: I recently upgraded to an intel based system (was running an 8core amd before), and it no longer crashes. Maybe they patched it, or maybe it just doesn't like AMD.   However I still don't like the game as a whole. There are still things in the main menu listed as 'comming soon' despite it supposedly being a finished product, and the gameplay's rather restricted from my point of view.  The first commentary I heard in the game began when I was halfway thru the kart series - I didn't even think they had comments until then.   Having played some 30 minutes in the 'kart1' kart, I find the game monotonous and uninspiring. There's no urge to finish the season or do anything. Doesn't feel like a finished product.  I'm going to uninstall the game now.
3506	0	a	I bought this game with hope of great 'new gen' career mode and a lot of beautiful cars. Career is just like a nightmare, I started with karts and now I have to slowly progress throughout every season with hope of getting contract for F1 or GT... UI is confusing, number of cars available in this game made me laugh... controller settings are not explained, hard to set up for Xbox controller.  Game is extremely boring, you dont feel the car like in other games, engine sounds very similar in same category cars, low number of players playing online   You may like this game however I prefer worst graphic with Gran Turismo 6 on my PS3.
3507	0	a	Over a year since release date and it's still impossible to race solo with AI or with people online unless you join a league. So many countless problems that don't get looked at.
3508	0	a	I have hundreds of hours on Sim Racers but I do not get to enjoy this game. Icannot recommend this game based on my humble opinion. This game falls into a gray area between Sim Racing games and Arcade-Casual driving games. My recommendation: For casual racing, nice graphics and physics go for Assetto Corsa. For hardcore SimRacing, go for iRacing.
3509	0	a	Such a shame really. When I heard about this game, I though brill a game to beat Assetto Corsa. OH how wrong I am. The AI on this game is terrible, they will just ram you constantly and spin you off the track. The game will lag the moment you add AI, and I'm running a 4790K and SLI GTX980 yet I still can't get solid frames in a race.  I would NOT recommend this game to anyone. Infact, Ridge Racer back on PSone is better than this game.  Okay, the graphics are beaitufl I won't lie. The cars are really detailed, as are the tracks. But... It's just shocking. They've had ample oppertunity to optimise the game... But no they're now focusing on releasing Project Cars 2, which I'm sure will be just as bad.
3510	0	a	'Thrustmaster supported' does not actually mean their products work. Are there any blogs with useful information? No. Are there any informative procedures? No. Are threads full of people who stick to the topic and provide clear info? No. Great graphics but integration is not reliable.
3511	0	a	Disappointing in so many ways.  Force feedback was added late and it is still not properly done, you need to spend a lot of time tuning and configuring to get something decent out of it.  Tire model? There are two levels of grip: plastic and not-plastic - both lack the flex or rubber tires. Not really the way rubber tires work according to different temperatures, does not handle properly things like flatspotting and heat cycles so it is not as 'lively' or believable to drive with.  Car simulations are overly generic and simplistic: not enough of vehicle-specific characteristics in the handling. There are values to change but they don't behave like you would expect.  Visuals in promotions and trailers are nice though.  As a game it might be decent but as a simulator it is not enough to satisfy experienced drivers. Accomplishments leave a fake feeling.  There are better choices available. Even previous title (Shift 2 Unleashed) from the same developers is better than this..
3512	0	a	UPDATE: Uninstalled on Hdd and reinstalled on my ssd, game runs so much better. review may change if I get consistantly better preformance.. Still caution though, especially if you don't have an ssd.   When the game runs it is a very pretty very fun racing sim. It feels very immersive, and really makes you feel like a racecar driver. The only things missing is maybe some more cars, and it'd be nice if you could buy and customize cars to race with. All cars are unlocked from the start, and the only customization seems to be real complex technical stuff like tire pressure and such, but no big deal the game is really fun... When it launches.   The reason for the negative review, is that about 90% of the time I launch the game, it shows the first logo, then goes black when trying to play the opening cinamatic. I have to ctrl alt delete out and open task manager, and then reclick the game window, ussually around 3 times if it is going to run at all, after that i end up ending the task. It has NEVER ONCE launched on its own with no troubleshooting. And once I get it running, if i alt tab out to change music or something, it is black screen again.. :/  When it does launch and work, I get from 60-90 fps at very high- ultra settings besides FXAA. So it isn't that i can't run it.. Can't get a refund as i didn't play this game until around a month after I bought it, so it didn't meet steams refund requirements. This is the first steam game I've had that legit doesn't work. :/   Buyer beware I guess..  My Rig: i5 4570 k @ 3.7 GHZ, gtx780ti, 16 gigs ram, game on WD 1tb hard drive.   If you have any fixes comment below.   Thank you.
3513	0	a	A bit underwhelming so far. My main point of criticism is the car handling which is pretty much hit and miss. For example the Radical SR8-RX is nearly undrivable without driving aids and even then tends to spin out in slow turns at the slightest push on the throttle. Also most of the options and settings are poorly explained, if at all. The 'digital manual' is a joke and not helping at all when you want to know what some hard to comprehend menu settings are all about. Also I am not sure if the career mode will hold my interest for long with no incentive other then achievements. But this is more of sandbox racer and with that I am fine as long as the racing is thrilling. AI is very convincing already and can only get better with future updates. As for now, I can't really recommend a purchase and adivse to wait a few weeks until most of the problems have been fixed.
3514	0	a	Dont waste your money get assetto its a far better simm this is just an arcade game too much time wasted trying to make it feel like a simm but you never will
3515	0	a	As someone who does real-life track racing, I can tell you the physics model is stupidly unrealistic. If you go into any corner as fast as you do in real-life, or even maybe just 30mph (in any in-game car) the tyres will suddenly, completely and unrecoverably break loose and you'll just slide straight into the outside barrier no matter what you do. If driving was really that hard in real life no one would ever even complete a lap without an accident.
3516	0	a	Found a 16 page PDF on how to set up your FFb so it feels somewhat real,,,, 16 pages of tweaks just to feel some feedback in a racing game...... errr no thanks, I will go back to GTR2 and actually feel when the back end is sliding out
3517	0	a	If you want a game thats expensive and then makes you pay an extra 50 quid for the good content, buy this. I only play it because there's nothing else in my steam library, it's a pretty shallow game aswell and it's very generic. Good graphics but the delivery of the product is dreadful. Get Forza for windows not this 3/10 overall.
3518	0	a	Absolutely useless. I have Logitech G920 wheel and the pedals are the wrong way around i.e PCars thinks the brake is the accelerator and the cluch is the brake. Then in race the FFB takes over and rips the wheel out of my hand as if the game was trying to steer the car. What a usless piece of ♥♥♥♥.
3519	0	a	I really regret buying this game. Very dissapointed. Extremely limited choice in cars. The game feels like an alpha test.

3521	0	a	This game is clearly unfinished ! Dont get me wrong its a very pretty game but there is a lot of little things that will bug the hell out of you, such as the unhandled exception crash which effects the majority of people ! The handling feels as if you are driving on ice, online is poorly thought out and the a.i in single player are all over the place. I feel this game was rushed for release. NOW for my major concern - i posted in the forums stating that i felt the game was clearly unfinised and isnt quite ready for release, it was deleted in a few hours !!! thats CENSORSHIP.........
3522	0	a	This game is pretty, no doubt about it. But when you compare it to its peers as an actual driving simulator, or even a comprehensive motorsport game it comes up way short.  Some glaring issues include: -No way to comprehensively track lap times. You will have no holistic way to see how fast you did a hot lap on a given track with Car A versus Car B. You can only see your fastest lap in a given car on a given track by entering a new game.   -No way to tell if ABS, stability control, or Traction control are on in game. This is pretty infuriating when the weather switches to rain.  -Weather physics are just wacky. Torrential downpour? Please reduce speed by 5mph and proceed as normal. Post rain wet track? Better bring your iceskates! Consistency is just not there.  - Again, lol physics  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdQBpWoXpU&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=22s&amp;noredirect=1   - Force feedback setup is nightmarish.

3524	0	a	Stunning game... As in probably the best yet against Grid / Asetto.. Physics are great &amp; I think once the bugs are sorted it could be really good.  At the moment Its unplayable to me.. Every time I pit in the car seems to sink into aspalt - sparks fly like I have 4 flats... I also have HUD indicators that randomly disappear.......This game has been out long enough now for this kind of flaw to be ironed out &amp; looking at the forums its not a new complaint... It really is still a project &amp; shouldnt have been released
3525	0	a	Right now, I cannot recommend this game, the core aspect of it is very cool and fun, racing in just about everything from karts to Formula 1 (or Formula A in this) , however the AI is awful, on 100% AI difficulty it feels like they are first time drivers too scared to hit the gas pedal, they also do no respect your racing lines and will turn into you causing crashes, I have to play with damage off because of this, cause there nothing like going into a turn with that lapped car swerving right into your side causing you to fly up into the air and ending your race. Save your money, Get F1 2015, or wait until this mess is fixed.  On the note of AMD cards not running well, this is not a problem for me, however I've seen lots of people who have AMD cards saying it runs poorly. Be warned on this.
3526	0	a	'the bugs make it better!' no thanks. was not pleased with this 'simulator' not enough customizeation and i dont like how the options are set up. no settings menu, and doesn't really explain everything all to well.

3530	0	a	I was really looking forward to this game. I wanted something i could pick up and play whenever and even hop online. Sadly this game doesnt deliver in a lot of areas. The AI in career mode is quite terrible, you will be forced to restart many races from them crashing just after the start of the race. And if you do get a clean start, be ready for them to not care about the race line and take you out. This isnt even the worst part. The online is remarkably bad, mainly trying to find games. That should be the easy part, but with the severe lack of normal filters you would expect, its a nightmare. Half the time you just stop playing because its such a hassle. Ive played this game for months hoping it would get better. I was hoping to stay away from subscription based games, but i think im going to need to go back. This game just dissapoints me everytime i come back to it.
3531	0	a	Ill Keep it short, waste of money  4/10  Good variaty of tracks Not enough Cars NO CARRER MODE.....
3532	0	a	I want to like this game, but it falls short to other racing sims and simcades. The roster is strong, the driving is great, and the tracks are represented well from their real life counterparts. Physics are top notch giving each vehicle its own unique quirks and driving styles, but the short list of available vehicles and limited customization leave a lot to be desired.   While earlier games (shift 2 and shift) from the devs had bugs of their own, they were easily fixable through editing files. Although the game also suffered from a small roster, cars could be upgraded, tweaked, modded, and personalized by the player. Not possessing the same complex physics however like Project CARS shift 2 and 1 were both delivered an enjoyable racing experience that was more varied than the rigid and strict environment Project CARS offers.   There's also the penalty system that was created by Stalin himself. Touch the grass? INVALIDATED. Go wide and slow down? INVALIDATED. Hit a wall or car? INVALIDATED. Personally it’s comical to read in patch notes how penalty implementation is constantly being tweaked and updated to be 'fair' under the guidance of the community. There's nothing fair about it when 6 inches off the track on the backend of Nurburgring instantly invalidates your current time as well as the time for the next lap because going wide in a turn was such an advantage. The community must be full of simracing Hitlers never even spending a second on an actual track that want to make sim driving harder than real life for 'muh realism.'   With Forza 6, Horizon 1 and 2, Grid, and Shift offering a better simcade experience with customization, and Iracing, Simbin, RaceRoom, and RFactor offering a better simulator, it's hard to explain what Project Cars is striving to be. Unlike niche games like DiRT Rally that offer an entirely different motorsport discipline, Project Cars is competing with other platforms that simply do it better with more to offer. Even Assetto Corsa, which is in a similar state as Project CARS, at least gives the ability for consumers to add their own cars, tracks, and other mods to the game.   Project CARS needs a defining quality that sets it apart from the rest of the available sims and simcades while delivering a less restrictive playstyle. Pretty graphics and physics can only go so far if the content and game mechanics are lackluster.
3533	0	a	The game is seriously good but It hasn't worked past the second day I bought it. I dont understand how a game can go this long without fixing the worst of its crashes, better yet even the most minor ones. Project cars will have you on the edge of your seat tightly gripping your controller rminding yourself just how much you spent on your gaming pc so you don't smash it to pieces because the bloody thing just doesn't work. I want my money back. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.
3534	0	a	This game has potential, and is a ton of fun IF you can get it to work, but it's full of bugs and weird hardware issues. If you're not willing to swim through a litany of bugs and issues, I cannot recommened this game.
3535	0	a	This game sucks please don't buy it, I know I have a lot of hours in it but trust me - it sucks jut don't do fall for the trap like I did.
3536	0	a	I have played this game from its early alpha versions in 2012 right through to the current release. It tries to be everything to everyone and rather than focussing on doing a few things well , it does all things average. Patched with layers upon layers of bandaids , the wounds continue to bleed and infection has set in. This game is terminally ill and will never recover. The developers deny this , and don't take kindly to their customers pointing out that their baby is on its death bed.  If you want a good driving sim , avoid Project Cars at all cost.
3537	0	a	As of writing this review I have 207.6 hrs. I have purchased every single DLC for this game. Even as late as 1 day of writing this negative review.  I really want to support the devs on the absolutely beautiful game but jesus, where to begin?  I just simply cannot reccomend this game. There are too many issues to list here.  Head over to the official PCars forum and look at the massive thread sizes of technical issues:  http://forum.projectcarsgame.com/forumdisplay.php?121-PC-Technical-Help-amp-Support   Do you have the time to read through 100s of pages of users trying to group-think their way into solutions for game issues that devs are completely unable to fix?

3540	0	a	I have an AMD R9 290+ , and i cant play even on 'Middle'-Graphicsettings , this is just a Nightmare. Ive waited for this game so long &amp; and this is all u have?! Shame on you!  It's not SMS fault? It's not AMD? I don't freaking care.. just fix it , now!  ANYBODY WHO HAS AN AMD GPU , DONT BUY THIS GAME!!!
3541	0	a	absoulty sucked.. says its still running on my pc ( and its not ) now i cant delete this damn game or do anything with it
3542	0	a	Good game, however theres one thing that annoys the hell out of me and thats the cut track penalty you get even when your knocked off the track by the AI or other players... its a problem thats been there for awhile from my research on the issue so I don't expect it to be sorted anytime soon or ever..... but if you can look past that then its a great game.
3543	0	a	Plays great, but comparing to Forza it lacks in content extremaly.. don't make PC2... why?? give us content here, your game is capable of 12k resolution.. no new game needed
3544	0	a	Loaded with bugs. Almost unplayable.
3545	0	a	im not saying this is a bad game, i just dont like it and i honestly would not tell my firedns they should buy it.  the game is stable runs like a champ maxed out even though my card is throttling at my middle power state, and its quite a pice of eye candy. but the lack of a free roam and lack of destruction makes it just another boring sim racer. also things like tire pressure being in somthing called BAR instead of PSI and using MM instead of IN made me not able to understand the tuning of the cars. its a shame this game dose not play more like hoe NSF undercover did becase other than a low fun level its an amazing game, and to some poeple this game is probboly perfect but it aint for me. somthing else that bugged me was lack of amarican cars and lack of car variaty.  not only that, i can fine tune all this small stuff that would be super difficult to do in real life... but i cant do things like motor swaps and body kits and diffrent transmissions. i payed 10$ for the game and after an hour i was not haveing fun and it did not look like the fun was coming. i wish this game would get an overhall becase from the core its amazing.
3546	0	a	- No progression - Can't own any cars - Very little personalization - Horrible controller controls  If you enjoy doing nothing but racing then this is the game for you.  If you actually want some content then unfortunately you're going to have to buy a PS3 or Xbox One to play Gran Turismo or Forza Motorsport/Horizon. Once again PC gaming will still go on with boring racing games.
3547	0	a	you got an AMD card? dont buy it. simple as that
3548	0	a	After spending too many hours on Assetto Corsa trying to shave milliseconds of my laptime just because it was fun I came here expecting I'd get somewhat of the same experience in a game that offers quite a bit more variety. I was hugely disappointed. Mostly because the lack of fun and challenge compared to driving in the actual simulation game mentioned above.  And what comes to variety? The cars feel too generic. Jumping from everyday roadcar into a full blown monster is more meh than anything else (again, comparing to Assetto Corsa, where the ♥♥♥-clenching is real). The career does not offer much in terms of achieving anything, as it gives you the opportunity to go race in any league/serie you want from the very beginning. Then you just grind onwards and it's meh.  So, if you're a fan of awesome simulator games, move on. And if you're looking for awesome arcade game, move on.  .meh/10
3549	0	a	Unfortunately unable to value the full potential of the game, due to bugs. Therefore cannot recommend game for everyone as I do not consider this game as stable enough. Pros:  - Music - Career - Lots of tracks/cars Cons: - Very CPU intensive (I had i3 3225, it was bad). More than Assetto Corsa or Grand Theft Auto 5 :-/ Why? - Buggy: slow motion bug, almost cannot play. I upgraded to i5 3570K and GTX 970 OC result not improved much, having 60+FPS I do expect same bug. No feeling of smoothness.  Medium graphic settings on my previous GTX 650 Ti does not looked so incredible, Assetto Corsa looked better. I upgraded to GTX 970 OC graphics look good, but slowmotion bug still appears from time to time. They should have made Early Access before final release as Kunos did.
3550	0	a	Great to see the are one Project Cars 2 already , and great to see all the freaking bugs still in Project Cars 1 Great Job guys , Excellent buggy game let's make another .
3551	0	a	+ The game has Great graphics. + Track selection is really good  - If you are playing using a wheel you will have to spend time tuning setup for each car individualy. Out of the box configuration gives NO feeling aside from suspension load. Menu structure makes this process miserable, confusing and as a result long.    
3552	0	a	I hate the handling!!!!!
3553	0	a	Im using r9 290 and the Framerates are horrible...i hope there's a fix to this problem
3554	0	a	Sorry, but I really cannot bring myself to enjoy the game... It's already boring with 10 hours of gameplay, and I'm even going to argue, the road car selection is horrid, It needs to be more extensive. The pros I guess, first person in the rain looks absolutely stunning but the third person driving physics are disgusting, It's all wonky and arcade.   I feel like the devs could do some drastic changes, before they ask for DLCs. I love the concept but, honestly 5 years of production is quite hard to believe, and the graphics aren't exactly matching the previews I was obssesed with...  If theres no drastic changes soon, I would do anything for a refund, I'll update my review later, but at the moment, this game is on the edge, lots of steering wheel players complaining about handling and movement although I use a controller and on most cars it feels great.  Pros: -Decent graphics -Sound on some cars is alright -Racing custimization is really deep -If you like rFactor, you'll like this -Fabulous rain driving experience -AI is better than most games -Decent smooth 60 FPS on GTX 970 Superclocked Maxed out  Cons: -Career mode is so bland -Car selection sucks (Sorry but it's true, theres barely ANY Japanese cars) -Some cars handle like its in Alpha development  -Future DLCs that will spam the users -Road cars are really squishy with horrible braking. -Theres not really any skid sounds -Really overhyped damage, the damage SUCKS! -Pit crew? You mean the guy standing there with a sign?  Sorry, I can't recomend this $69 game to anyone who loves sim racing like I do, I'm just providing constructive criticism, I hope all changes and Project Cars truly overcomes it's barriers and becomes one of the best racing games out on the market.   
3555	0	a	Ambitious, but clearly unfinished.  Pros: It looks pretty Decent selection of cars Nice selection of tracks It looks pretty  Cons: There's a plethora of glitches (I've experienced some of these  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gafhAP3UEC8  ) The physics are aweful for you, but excellent for the AI (typical of Slightly Mad titles) Doesn't run well once you get a few other cars on the screen (practice sessions and time trials are fine though) Doesn't run well on either of my rigs (and neither are slouches)    Bottom line: Go back to school Slightly Mad, clearly you didn't graduate...
3556	0	a	i've played for 60 minutes so far.... no wait i've been at a loading screen for 60 minutes because everytime it loads the race everything works but the graphics just freeze after i adjust my seat. great game ...
3557	0	a	waited so long for this game and wanted to like it so much, but i just don't. I love driving games, but this just isn't what was promised...very disappointed in almost every aspect of the game.wish i didn't waste the money.
3558	0	a	Game is a broken heap of ♥♥♥♥.
3559	0	a	Says it wants to be a simulator but falls short. Force feedback on a wheel is nowhere near as good as ac and the physics leave something to be desired. On the upside a very pretty game with nice features.
3560	0	a	Can i give this back?
3561	0	a	Honestly I have had fun in the game, but I can't recommend it :(   The physics is really not what I like! After playing Iracing, Assetto corsa or even Forza, this game doesn't compare to them in my eyes.
3562	0	a	There is a lot to like about this game. Unfortunately, I can't recommend it unless and until they actually finish the game. For me, Steam's new refund policy came at the perfect time, as PCars was the first game I bought after it was announced, and is the first game I've wanted to refund.  I'm not going to list the bugs I encountered, as that would take too long, and other reviews do enough there. I'll just say that I finally initiated the refund process after the AI put me into the wall during a rolling start.
3563	0	a	Game runs terribly on Radeon Cards (R9 290 here), crashes randomly, multiplayer is laggy like hell and the worst thing: It always uses another livery than the one i selected for the Aston GT3, this pisses me off!
3564	0	a	UPDATE! I've been told that it is possible to map a button to the 'reset view' option. But it is not located in the VR menu as I expected. Rather it is in the controls menu somewhere. I haven't tested this myself, but thought I would update my review.  -------------- Bought this game for VR, and even though it is the best racing sim I've tried in VR, it is just too rough on the edges for me to recommend. 'Gaze to select' can't be disabled, and if you edit the xml files to disable it yourself, you can sometimes end up not being able to exit a race because the reticle is needed to make the controller selection reach the 'continue' selection.  Graphics are pretty disappointing in the game overall. Cars look stunning, but the tracks are low-poly and with smudged textures. Plenty of z-mapping problems going on in many places aswell. The scenic routes are basically a nice road with some rough estimation of the terrain beside it. Several rocks sortof just lie halfway into the ground with the edge being really visible due to how they are placed one after the other. Just looks rough overall.  Car handling seems a bit weird to me. Car starts sliding really easily, but perhaps I am too used to arcade handling, so I'll let that be a neutral point.  Overall Project CARS, as a VR game, disappoints me for the roughness of it all.
3565	0	a	The thing that I would like to start off with is that I havent played this game that much. This was my first real racing sim that I bought. I was very hyped and I really thought that I would love it. Now I didn't, because I was too overhyped and I do not like the game. I don't like it, because I was overhyped, the sounds of the cars sounded like they were recorded with a cellphone. I personally do not recommend it, but if you're a hardcore racing fan, and the game is for sale, go for it.
3566	0	a	No Ferrari, no Lamborghini, no Porsche. Solid game but not much of a car sim without those big names.
3567	0	a	The game looks good and the weather is nice, it's a long way off a sim though and nowhere near worth the price tag. Avoid.
3568	0	a	First up, I was an early backer of the game but pulled out (and used the money to buy Game Stock Car).  First impressions were not good - I watched one video on you tube and the cars seemed a bit 'floaty' - as if they had no mass and were tip-toeing around the track. Plus, being old fashioned I bought the physical copy of the game - and noted that a game-pad is recommended - no mention of a wheel anywhere on the box.  First couple of races not good - again found the cars a bit floaty, although turning up the shadow detail has helped this. Now played for 3 hours, and while racing is ok there are some issues which ruin the immersion for me: 1. Qualifying - like Codemasters games, it ends qualifying as soon as time runs out - you cannot complete the lap you are on.  2. When leaving the pits the exit lights are always at red. 3. When entering pits you drive straight through any a.i. cars in your way  The game has been in development for years but it just doesn't feel like it.  Bottom line is I will probably persevere for a bit, but a definite disappointment.
3569	0	a	I just want to keep this short and simple.  This games graphics aren't as amazing as they're proclaimed to be, nor is the gameplay itself all that amazing as it was hyped to be.  I do not recommend this game.
3570	0	a	This is a pretty good racing game. It may even be one of the greatest sim's available to console players. However, I think it's a pretty bad PC sim. I play iracing, rfactor2, GSCE, and assetto corsa. In my opinion, all of them feel better to drive and have more realistic physics. PCars has good variety of tracks and cars but none of them feel particularly great.   Just my opinion, but I strongly suggest you look at GSCE or AC unless you really want a structured (yet bland) career mode.
3571	0	a	I have to say it is NOT only AMD users that have issues with this game, been waiting for them to update it so I can play it. I am running a 3.2 GHZ i5 with 8GB RAM and NVidia 760 GB you would imagine I should be able to run it fairly easily, like most of the games I own which have very little issues. Alas no, the game just sits using 100% CPU constantly and no game should be able to do that in my opinion.  Personally I think there is some bad coding here somewhere as the game looks fantastic, but just doesn't perform, there is absolutely no reason why it should sit using that much CPU power and I would personnally recommend most people should avoid this game until it is fixed with some updates and starts working properly.  All my other games I can not only run maxed out and reasonably FPS, but I can also STREAM or RECORD for YouTube at the same time, this game won't even run with no background tasks....  10/10 for effort, but 2/10 for quality. :-(
3572	0	a	Developer has focused on quantity rather than quality - a lot of nice features like dynamic weather, day-night cycle, great rain effects and (compared to other sims like iracing or AC) a large amount of cars. However, i cannot recommend it to those who are looking for a real racing simulator. AI is way to dumb and agressive. FFB offers thousands of different paramter combinations to adjust but it still lacks an authentic feeling (at least with my T500). Despite all that the lead developer seems to be quit arrogant and rough in the way he deals with his customers (e.g. banning people from the forum who criticize the product [in a constructive manner]). Go for AC if you are looking for a solid simulator with a great ffb and relativly smart AI (after the 1.2 update). Join Iracing when seeking for the ultimate MP experience.
3573	0	a	This game has good looks. However, it's nothing more than Need for Speed: Shift 3 in disguise.  It's another buggy mess. Buy it during a steam sale.
3574	0	a	This game is absolutely horrid i would recomend this to my worst enemy im going to actively persue my money back
3575	0	a	♥♥♥♥ THIS GAME! DO NOT BUY IT UNLESS YOU ENJOY BEING FRUSTRATED EVERY TIME YOU PLAY A GAME! Don't alt+tab while it's loading, well the game alt+tabs by itself on start. What happens when you alt+tab when loading? You can't use your wheel! HORRIBLE server filters! I can't even organize the servers by ping or player count when I actually get the game working. Empty servers so I guess I'll just go back to Live for Speed! Not to mention this game is made by a company who went into the Need for Speed series. Why are you even trying to make a 'simulator'? The graphics don't even make up for all the bugs and crappy physics!
3576	0	a	This game has good looks. However, it's nothing more than Need for Speed: Shift 3 in disguise.  It's another buggy mess. Buy it during a steam sale.
3577	0	a	A bumper car race with very bad physics - not fun - go slow or restart till you are fed up then quit the game and move on. I am never going to be Lewis Hamilton - just want to have some fun and you can't do that when driving a paper air plane in the shape of a car (with my Logitech G27). Guess its back for Forza.
3578	0	a	This game still has a problem with loosing your savegame after some kinds of crashes. The problem is known for a long time but the developers don't do anything against it. It would be simple to implement automatic backup and restoring ift necessary at the game startup if they can't find a better way. But they don't even acknowledge it as a bug as they seem to think that it's normal to loose all progress after a game crash. If you plan to play the game, always backup your savegame located at '\Steam\userdata\[id]\234630\local\project cars\profiles\default.sav'.
3579	0	a	THE OIL SLICK DRIVING SIMULATOR.  Trying to drive a car in this game is unpredictable. It's like driving on super soft dragster tires and then suddenly having a set of cheap bald-to-the cords set of tires and the road being covered in PTFE and motor oil. I spent around 4.8 hours of playtime attempting to make it more playable to no avail. Setting everything to the EXTREME side of low sensitivity and such helped slightly but its like, again, driving on plastic toy car tires. I know how to drive and am no amateur with racing. This isn't realistic at all. Pertaining to the AI or what little I did play with AI, it seems fine.. I drove with rain on the track and its not much different from dry conditions. Graphically its nice, sounds are good (except for tunnel sounds, its a bit harsh), wearther effects are nice as well. Selection of cars are decent, but to get more requires DLC and there isn't many everyday road cars.
3580	0	a	What a crap load of software ! Worst 50 euros i ever spent . Its not much better than RFactor which is totally free but the best thing is the slowmotion bug it pulls on many people out there. And yes .. i did set the ♥♥♥♥ING FORCE feedback to zero. Which shows how incomplete this game again is .. The force feedback is still buggy at launch in a ♥♥♥♥ing RACE GAME !! But the worst thing is the slow motion launch bug .. It slows u down while u drive ..and then out of nowhere it launches you over the track as if you were playing ♥♥♥♥ing mario kart . BIG L O L ! Most of the time u end up crashing into the sideline. And thats in SINGLEPLAYER !! i ♥♥♥♥ you NOT ! In SINGLEPLAYER U HAVE ♥♥♥♥ING RUBBERBANDING and a feeling of LAG !! Can u ♥♥♥♥ing believe that ? LAG in singleplayer mode !! Good job Bandai Namco you ♥♥♥♥ing TOYMAKERS ! go back to make hello kitty puppets you ♥♥♥♥ing greedy MOFOS! I WANT MY ♥♥♥♥ING MONEY BACK ! Unplayable in this stage if you dont have one of the featured Steering wheels and a super computer
3581	0	a	If you like graphics and nice menus buy this game.   If you like racing (with or without AI) buy assetto corsa instead.
3582	0	a	Do not get this game if you have a controller!!! I'm someone who enjoys racing games on all platforms, I play on system ranging from a Assetto Corsa with a Thrustmaster t500 + Oculus down to Xbox sims Like Forza, I also go-kart, a lot... This is the SINGLE MOST FRUSTRATING racing game i've ever tried to play with a controller. In these games I want to be able to put my car to the limit, drive in horrific conditions and still feel like the car is reacting the way I want. The problem I have is not with the physics but with the input! Games such as Forza and GT have a sort of AI controller assist which helps with things like oversteer and tiny corrections; this is because its impossible to be as accurate when using a controller over a wheel. This system helps keep the car stable. Project cars however seems to just have a bunch of rubber bands round the steering and a driver that turns the wheel like he's on crack cocaine. Meaning, you oversteer in a Ginetta Junior and you either countersteer into an unrecoverable tank slapper or (with other settings) sit with the gas off in full slide waiting for the idiot steering angle to get just a little bit bigger (which it never does). The end result is: the controls destroy the fun, race after race as you spin into the grass, you just get to pick whether you prefer the inside or the outside of the track.  You guys were so close to making this awesome! I cannot imagine how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ people will be if they got this for xbox or ps4. I guess i need to get a seriously good wheel and test that... Jeez, this is a £500 game...
3583	0	a	personally i think this game is ♥♥♥♥
3584	0	a	hated it, asked for refund
3585	0	a	Simply put, don't buy it.  It folds to desktop everytime it starts, bad optimization of the graphic engine, digital sounds very similar from car to car, steering wheel lock not configurable, tons and tons of aliasing, erratic AI, arcade physics, etc. I want a refund.
3586	0	a	Just don't buy it. I beg of you. Looks great and it is great... for the first hour then you realise how much bugs there are, how you only have a few cars, of which you all have at the start of the game, so there's no challenge and you get board, multi is crap, just dont buy it
3587	0	a	Makes me feel like my license should be revoked.    But is very pretty.
3588	0	a	65 bucks? THAT'S ROBBERY Now, you may be get skeptical by looking at my hours and say that it's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. If you're not, I ask that you read. ESPECIALLY if you're a newb like me I really wanted to enjoy playing this game but to simply put it, these are the reasons why I cannot &gt; Some cars really over steer beyond control. Just makes playing the game really frustrating  This seems to secretly imply that one should go and get the steering wheel controller because you'll probably have a much more easier life doing so. &gt; The so called PhysX collision detection system gives of a little smell of what I would call ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. when I started turning left, the game suddenly lagged a little and went to bang the wall which was what would have happened if I didn't turn left. Sure, sue me. It doesn't sound very convincing coming from a noob. Why not let's just say that the learning curve is crazy high and there are just some flaws that I can't deal with. Also, there aren't exactly a lot of cars. If you're expecting lamborghini, I'll tell you straight that at the moment there's not a single one of them 3/10
3589	0	a	The worst game I have ever played.  Ai is crap  Ai always hit my car and knock it out the race just by a scrape
3590	0	a	unhandled exception after going to settings and cannot play anymore
3591	0	a	Faulty AI, horrible menu design, and an obvious lack of AMD support! A game to be avoided.   A very hyped title, with a long development time, the game suffers from a lack of fun. The multiplayer can be fun from time to time, but there is usually somewhere there who feels ramming you is the best way to take the first corner of the race.  The single player is incredibly bland in which you just play event after event wondering what you are doing with your life. No career progression (or clear career progression - I never stuck it out long enough to find out). The AI are either too good or too stupid, and sometime stop, or just drive anywhere for no real reason.  You can't polish a turd, adn boy has this game tried with its fancy graphics. Undeneath its shiny interior is budget title racer that wouldnt look out of place back in 2004
3592	0	a	This is the WORST sim car I've ever play, and I have many of them!!!!! (and many steering wheels)  I spected a Lot of this game and I'm very   Cons: Very complex to undersand the software, not the gameplay Small list of cars, and no exotics like lambo or ferrari You cant completely tune your car, and AFTER A LOT OF TIME OF WORKING ON IT YOU REALIZE THE CHANGES WERE NOT SAVED (VERY FRUSTRAITING) Small list of tracks Imposible to show the HUD in the cockpit camera You don't have a pilot profile to choose helmet or accesories  The graphics are good but not so good as spected for the Nvidia Graphics  I HARD RECOMMEND NOT TO BUY IT, IS A COMPLETELY WASTE OF MONEY!!!  WHY IS SO HARD TO FIND A GOOD SIM CAR ON PC?
3593	0	a	the AI ♥♥♥♥
3594	0	a	Properly disappointed. Thought I had found my answer to Forza on PC, the physics feel like rocket league's moon grav modifier, the car choice is absolutely laughable, could not find settings for my wheel or joypad that made the game pheasibly playable before my refund time limit ran out, AI is on rails and it doesn't matter what you do it will feel like your trying to navigate a white van down a one way street whilst the AI is playing go karts on an airfield. Rubbish game no matter WHAT you do to tweak it. Just glad I wasted money on this whilst it was in the sale and hope my refund gets accepted.
3595	0	a	The game is great fun the problem is that there is just not much going on with mulitplayer. Only 3 -4 multiplayer groups opperating at a time. Im not sure why?
3596	0	a	This is a story of my thoughts about this game given my exposure of the near entire development of this game.  I was on board with this game ever since the game was available for alpha testing. I purchased the full copy option that was available since I loved the idea of aiding in creating what could be, and was proposed at the time, the greatest new generation racing sim. Every month I would play the newest build, pleased to see the development happen before my eyes. In the early days the game seemed to be going in the right direction with likeable content, menues being refined, ect.   And then it seemed something changed. Almost as if someone made the decicion, 'We no longer want to make the most realistic racing sim. We want to make a racing game that poses itself as a racing sim for everyone to enjoy, even console gamers.' From then on it seemed that everything that was done was to make it enjoyable for EVERYONE, even the casual racer. This path pogressed and the game was released.   I was appaled at the release of the game. It still had issues from before the game was delayed. This turned me off completely. I left the game in the back of my head and as time went on I've seen that the developers did indeed make multiple patches through time and months after the release i decided to give it another go. I played it again and am even more let down than I was before. These developers have a horrible trend of fixing issues and in doing so introducing new ones. It's been like this since the begining.  This game could have lived up to the name that the developers originally had for it but it didn't because they changed what the game was ment to be halfway through its development. That is why i feel the game suffers as many issues as it does, because they had to make changes to things that should have never been changed at all.  I'd like to mention that about 65 of my 70+ hours in the game were from before the game was offically released. not to mention the uncounted hours from before the game even made it onto Steam. 
3597	0	a	After being really excited to purchase this game I went through the long installation process only to find that the game will not work due to an 'Unhandled Exception Trapping' error. If you, like me, are not technically minded this is an absolute nightmare as when looking up solutions on Google there's loads of suggestions which include changing these elaborate settings, to which I have no clue how to access. The solutions that I could work on didn't even work, so a week after I bought the game I still haven't played a single second of it. I don't know why Slightly Mad Studios made a game which works in this way, I miss the days when you could simply put your game disc into your machine and it would play instantly, without any of this installation or compatibility kerfuffle. I don't want to have to spend loads of money on a new laptop just so I can play the game, and it really is a poor performance from Slightly Mad Studios if they have made a game which is only good for the newest of computers, not for people with slightly older computers who can't afford to upgrade.
3598	0	a	Let me start by saying that I was SO excited for this game. After playing for just a few minutes, the main thing I noticed was the sound design. It is so terrible that it completely ruins the game for me. To be fair, being a sound engineer and musician probably makes me a little more critical than the next person, but this is truly awful sound design. The engines don't sound right at all. They clearly sound like several samples being used that use pitch bending between said samples. If done right, it can sound great, but this is just not up to par in terms of professional sound quality. Every racing game or car centric game I've played that uses FMOD tends to sound this way, so to be fair that's probably a factor. Every game that I've played that utilized wWise middleware sounds so much cleaner. If you have Dirt Rally or even just Dirt 3, listen to the revs in that compared to this. Night and day. Also in terms of sound, certain sfx like hitting a guardrail on highway one sound way too loud, and then stay at the same volume until you slow to practically a halt. You could even still be moving, grinding against the guardrail and the sound would be gone. If you accelerate along the guardrail again, the sound is still stopped, which tells me that it's more an issue with implementation.   The visuals are great, and I can run at almost max settings with my GTX 770, but the lighting doesn't really do it for me. The physics are just okay, but the car is WAY too stable in a straight line.   All in all, this game feels unfinished. The sound design is its most obvious flaw, and I think to really make a top notch product, they need to step it up in that area.
3599	0	a	A wonderful racing game completely ruined by the AI. They're way too aggressive, and you'll be taken out if you have the inside line.
3600	0	a	Absolute worst piece of bugged garbage I've spent 50$ on.
3601	0	a	Game needs AMD driver fix, then ill fix my review  Able to play capped at 40fps. Playable. Needs a fixin.  I have CPU 8350 4.0ghz GPU R9 290x OC II by ASUS  Help a brother out! I'm going Slightly Mad here!
3602	0	a	Game Crashes more than an AI opponent on 0 Difficulty setting
3603	0	a	It says 'Nvidia GT600 series' as the recommended specs so I just 'accidentally' bought Nvidia GT 610 and it still run on utterly low FPS below 15.  This game claimed to be able to run on low-end graphics. Okay, but horrible optimization when dealing it with lower resolution and no fullscreen option for lower resolution.  In other words...urrgh...
3604	0	a	Cool but there are much better racing games. Also vr works well but for the general game side its too espensive for such a bad enemy AI.
3605	0	a	THIS GAME IS AMAZING! I am not. I am not hardcore enough for this game! I thought by purchasing this game, that I would finally be graduating from Gran Tur Forza into the true sims like the F1 series. I was SO wrong. There is no upgrade or money system. I can't take a base Honda Fit, and slowly upgrade it into a track beast (Bad example, I know the Fit would never be a track beast, but a boy can dream.) The THOUGHT of qualifying gives me a panic attack because of my inability to have a 'clean' lap. The weather effects are BEAUTIFUL; but whenever it so much as sprinkles, I might as well quit because I WILL spin out. I know the process of practice, qualify, race comes from the real world; but I lose interest half-way through qualifying.   To sum up, I will make a comparison. This game is Rocksmith, and Forza/Gran Turismo is RockBand. Rocksmith is trying to teach you to be a real musician, like Project CARS is trying to make you a better driver. Rockband just wants you to have fun playing on plastic instruments. At the end of the day, I'll keep my plastic guitar.
3606	0	a	Maybe, just maybe. Before next DLC they should try to fix the bugs that have been there from release. This is just BIG maybe.
3607	0	a	Best demolition derby simulator on steam.
3608	0	a	controlls do not work and everything is wrong
3609	0	a	I wish there was a refund policy for BS Games that have no Demo
3610	0	a	Yes the amount of content in this game is massive; unfortunately the experience is marred by Funny Physics and blindly formulaic AI. 
3611	0	a	Project Cars huh.  Well I think it needs alot of work. Starting a online race is utterly rediculas. No voice chat. The replay UI stinks to hell and a hand basket. This sim looks to me like it was rushed out the damn door. I would personally would be embarassed if I was a dev on this project to release it the way it is.   It does drive well and the cars and graphics are good. But seriously you all need to work on in it. Worth the price of admission? Definitly not.
3612	0	a	love/hate  What I love:  -The amount of setup work, reminds me of the old papyrus racing games and Iracing. - The weather effects - The vanilla Track list.  What I Hate: -THe DLC, they add road cars and more variants of the same manufacturers without adding new ones - Manufacturer list, especially in the GT and LMP list, for:  *LMP1, No Toyota, CLM, Rebellion, or Porsche, only audi  *LMP2 No morgan, ligier, strakka, lola or HPD  *GTE: Non existant with the outdated M3 GT in GT3 somehow  *GT3: No ferrari, chevorlet, porsche (RUF as a stand in), ford, lamborghini, nissan, viper, maserati, jaguar, ascari, in fact there is more manufacturers missing than there is represented.    Stop adding more useless cars and use the DLC sales to build more licenses.
3613	0	a	Totally wrong driving physics - example, when going around a corner in a powerful rear wheel drive car you should comdfortably be able to knock the back end out into a drift. This game simply doesn't let you. Somebody okeyed this at the top and thought that was a great idea. They need sacking from the game industry FOREVER. Oh so do the games 'testers'.
3614	0	a	So im a online racer, i like racing a human, if you like online racing this is not the game for you. If you are a solo racer, Time Trial, campaine, this is for you. pretty game, good controls, good sound, horrid online racing.
3615	0	a	I really wanted to like this game. It looks stunning and has wide choice of cars and tracks. But force feedback is too simplified in my opinion. For me this removes most of the fun from driving in this game.  And the fact that you have to actually press brake pedal to reverse? This game definitely isn't a simulator.
3616	0	a	Although there is a ton of content, the AI is broken, the pits stop are broken, and the damage have been almost tone down to nothing. Yes the driving is great, the speed is fantastic, but the AI cut corners all the time, is too aggressive and has trouble seeing other cars. The choice of tires is not working on the automatic settings. In the pit stop refueling doesn't always work either (which is a very big problem). The AI seems to also have an advantage in the rain, or at least get the good tires compare to ours. The Kart part is annoying because the camera doesn't stop jerking around.  Since the AI is so stupid and aggressive, the damage must have been tone down to almost nothing. So all you have to do is to bump the cars out of the way. This is an arcade game in this current state. The simulation is there but is half finished. For all the shiny and amazing graphics, once you take the wheel against the AI, you will find it's a big let down. I have driven many racing game since 1995, this one look so promising yet it failed where it should be shining.   Update: since the patches the AI isn't cheating that much, but to compensate the AI is much harder within certain tracks. It's like they put an extra level of control for the AI, while you are %*&amp;%?9 with your own car. You still can push the AI off track, but now they will do the same. Since there is no damage on so many cars, it just makes the game an arcade bump ride. Maybe the developpers wanted a simulation but they ended up with a completed different product in the end. The lack of damage just makes the AI and the players reckless with very little consequences on their actions.
3617	0	a	Bought the game ... and DLC .... ' I regret so much to have done that ' This game is so darn complicated to set up ....  I have a a Trustmaster T300 RS wheel with separate pedal ..... ' tired of buying game that does demand so much set up or just will not work..... ' possible to get money back from DLC ' ??????/  Now on PS4 I play Gran Torismo 6 and wow what a ride ...even in 3D .... love it .
3618	0	a	as usual trying to contact product support is near impossible and you have to rely on forums to help you. i still can't play the game and am awaiting a response on the forums
3619	0	a	Assetto Corsa is better.   End Of.  And more to the point; SMS say that professional drivers helped them with this game.  By the state of the A.I i would assume it's Pastor 'Crashtor' Maldonado.
3620	0	a	Some may disagree, but that's ok, but I think this game, mechanics wise, is better than Assetto Corsa. Clutch play and mechanics are superior to AC. In this game if you stall, there is no stepping on the gas, then having the car auto start WHILE IN GEAR WITHOUT clutch held in. In this game if you stall, you must either go into neutral, or stay in gear but hold in the clutch, and if you stall again, which you will if you do not how to drive stick properly, you gotta do it all over again. I also likle the feel of the cars and handling better than AC, handling (AC to me, just feels too buffered, then again one could argue my wheel settings are bad) BUT this game has glitches, AND you cannot have more than one control setup saved at a time like in AC. So if you want to have xbox controller settings and tweaks saved along with your long worked for wheel settings, only one can be saved. This game has bugs, and yet the developers are talking about Project Cars 2??? I love the physics and handling in this game, but because of the lack of quality, and control saving features, I cannot recommend this game.
3621	0	a	GTX 965M With I7 4720 4th Gen 12gig Ram and still cant get a steady 50-60 fps with all graphics set to low.
3622	0	a	Maybe it's because I grew up playing the original Gran Turismo that I'm so critical of all racing games today, as nothing will compare to the greatest racing sim of all time. I would recommend this game ONLY if the price drops.   Pros  -Stunning graphics, A+++ This is what sold me on it. -Challenging gameplay and plenty of room to adjust difficulty based on your skill level. Just one mistake could easily send you to the back of the pack.  -Nice 'free race' allows you to skip to any track and set weather conditions with any car from the start. This really helped aid me in getting a feel for the controls.   Cons  -Unrewarding single player mode, win after win I'm in my 3rd season and still racing with the same car. Soon found myself aching to get the season over with. -Not a great variety of 'regular' everyday cars, mostly f1 cars. Biggest complaint overall with the game is there are not enough Japanese cars, NO Hondas, NO Subarus, NO Nissans, and the only American make is Ford. FORD!!! Would it really have been so hard to include just one Chevy? Selection is limited, the only car I was really stoked about was the Lancer EVO.  -Radio voice throughout race is okay at first but fastly becomes repetitive and annoying. -No option to customize the visual appearance of your car, only change the color IF you aren't driving a vehicle that's sponsored by your racing team. No need to upgrade parts as all cars are track ready. -Other drivers speed and handling are not as affected when run off the track and often times their aggression has knocked me off the track and caused unfair penalties.  -NO 2 playerr split screen :( I work at night and the multiplayer servers are pretty limited at 3am.  Neutral  -Tuning vehicles can be tedious and aggravating when all you wanna do is drive and there is a learning curve to this but there's an option to turn on driving and brake assists  -Could be a negative but there is no music. Perhaps appropriate for a sim game but if you wanna hear tunes you'll have to run a background program.
3623	0	a	Hey Project cars... why dont you fix the controller issues.... fix that ♥♥♥♥ instead of selling more crap dlc for a broke game... Project Cars DID NOT FIX CONTROLLER ISSUE.. THERE UPDATE SAYS THEY DID BUT THEY DID NOT STILL HAVING PROBLEMS FIX THIS GAME ITS MESSED UP YOU SELL ♥♥♥♥ PRODUCT AS NEW... ITS BROKEN AND SUCKS THE FUN OUT OF THE GAME.... IF YOU REALLT DONT CARE ABOUT CUSTOMERS ENOUGH TO FIX A BROKE GAME THANKS AGAIN FROM THE GAME WORLD You still have not fixed controller issue.....
3624	0	a	This game is bad for drifting with g27. The Fy force is not well made, even if i'ts tuned down to minimum, i still get clipping. Only on this game. every other games work great. If you like grip racing, feel free to buy. If not, better spend your money and time on Assetto Corsa
3625	0	a	I am using logitech driving force g29 and I am shocked that in this 'driving simulation' every car has 900 degrees steering wheel rotating angle. It is ok when driving ordinary cars but if I go race with formula car and have to spin my wheel like mad man it is not okey. Sure I can change the angle always when I change to different car but that is too awkward to me. In DIRT RALLY wheel rotating angles changed automatically for each car. I cant understand why not in this game.
3626	0	a	I would recommend this game to people who are already experienced with Racing Games. At first look, it made my eyes go crazy, i had no idea what i was doing. Then the controls were all crazy. It looked fun, but I just couldn't handle it.
3627	0	a	Still seems to have issues with AMD video cards. I'm running two RX 480s in CrossFire and the stuttering is crazy bad! The game is playable, and when it doesn't stutter it looks really good! However until AMD and these developers actually have a sit down to fix things I cannot recommend this to anyone with an AMD graphics card.
3628	0	a	Big fat disappointment. Developers gave up on the game soon after it was released announcing a PROJECT CARS 2.   Never will buy another game from these devs again. No variety. Decent AI. Great sound.
3629	0	a	This is a massive dissapointment to say the least. To start, the controls on this game are so twitchy that it is simply unplayable. The game just leaves me entirely frustrated. The steering is the biggest issue. Not only is it disgustingly twitchy, it feels so numb. Drifting is simply impossible. If your tires break loose there is no way you can correct it and you will inevitably crash. I play and am quite good at Forza, and this game should take notes. It is a complete miss. I do not recoment this game at all. Waste of money. For a game that was designed by car guys for car guys, this was a complete failure. This a car guy saying that this is one of the worst racing games I have ever played. To call it a sim is quite false. The audio is also aggresively mediocre. The engine sounds are extremely poor. The only thing this game has going for it is the graphics.
3630	0	a	Why is it that everytime there is an update all the calibration settings are lost, I really am getting sick of having to do this.... and unless I rebot, my steering unit and pedals are not even recognised..... starting to think this is not a game I would recommend 
3631	0	a	This game has amazing graphics , but it was not even close too being fun as grand trismo or NFS and the price is for the quality of the graphics not the game itself maybe the game would get a better review if it had an actual story and was about a fourth too a third of its price
3632	0	a	CONS: realism, bugs, settings, support.  Poor quality in overall. Sorry guys.  PROS: Graphics are really nice.   If u want a good rally game i recomended 'DiRT RALLY'.
3633	0	a	cars dont all handle realistic and numerous updates have changed the charactistics of a few cars from being fairly easy to drive on the limit to being impossible to drive, has a slightly arcady feel to the handling and most settings dont really change the character of the car like it does in real life or haven forbide it, like the gran turismo series. the fact the gt series from a console is more sim than this game has been shows how unpolished this game is. this game showed so much promise that i pre ordered from day dot and ive stayed around hoping it would be improved but the fact the devs went straight onto making the next game instead of fixing the imperfections on this game that couldve made this the Ultimate simulation racing game, instead they release some over priced dlc and nerf the handling for a lot of cars. they had the formula right for the cars included and tracks but let down by the poor handling mechanic
3634	0	a	I have an issue with the sounds. It seems have a weird cutting effect, when the engine rpm tops out or if I switch gears the engine sound cuts out for a micro second. It also seems to happen when I crash, it really takes me out of the immersion.   This seems to be a great game otherwise, but I just cant bring myself to play it the way it is now.
3635	0	a	This game has so much potential but the BIG problems is the lack of support for graphics drivers. My GTX 560ti worked great with this game until i upgraded to a GTX 760 and 770. This issue needs to be fixed ASAP.
3636	0	a	CONS: realism, bugs, settings, support.  Poor quality in overall. Sorry guys.  PROS: Graphics are really nice.   If u want a good rally game i recomended 'DiRT RALLY'.
3637	0	a	When I first downloaded the game it was great, good graphics, amzing track list, decent car list. It looked great, that was until I played. If you decide you want it USE A CONTROLLER OR WHEEL. If you are like me and don't have the stuff to do that, I'd suggest not downloading the game. When using the keyboard controls, turning is awful. If you have a controller you are all set and it should be fine. If not, I WOULD NOT SUGGEST IT.
3638	0	a	These devs are scammers, they promissed a Linux port, gathered all the money from the hype and them didn't deliver.
3639	0	a	i bouht this game. When i Started it I was dissapointed. Becouse this game has to many bugs its hard to drive, Its imposible to drive a gokart. Im happy i got this game refunded. Dont buy this game if you wanna play a racing game not worth.  
3640	0	a	Epic game but very bad localization. Cut-offs, wrong translations (gpu settings are translated as achievements to my language - Polish). you have to restart to apply settings.... Its not a beta guys fix it! Good game but not ready when it comes to quality.
3641	0	a	Biggest issue with this game is the lack of accuracy in driving. Tire traction with the asphalt is poor compared to Forza and Grand Turismo. Also, the faster the car, the more horribly uncontrollable the acceleration out of a turn. For some reason, when applying minor throttle out of a turn, rpm's are unrealistically increased to the point where the horrible traction physics send the car into a power slide.   Car physics in game do NOT compare to their real world counterpart. I think thats why they don't have a lot of lower tier/common cars in this game.
3642	0	a	Ian Bell is a ♥♥♥♥
3643	0	a	If you enjoy online racing where everyone just rams into you at every corner. Buy this game, because the AI do it as well.
3644	0	a	  Very poor performance
3645	0	a	I just bought the game at a discounted price. But it appears that it doesn't support my VIVE. Please advise how I can play the game on my VIVE. Thanks.
3646	0	a	well i would like to say i'm enjoying this so far but after an hour of driving go karts i've given up, lets hope playing against friends in multi player is more fun. one go kart race as a practice would have been fine but enough is enough i'll not be continuing with carrer mode as its bored the pants off me already, what a shame i was looking forward to it
3647	0	a	The physics vary from car to car more than they should in real life. The career mode is ruined because everything is unlocked from the start. There is no incentive to even play it. The multiplayer is full of people who don't want to race, but ram you. Developer support has been poor.
3648	0	a	Bugs, bugs everywhere
3649	0	a	This is a racing game that I reccomend you pass.   Especially considering the options in this category.  There is very little that this game does well that would warrant it over others out there. Such as Assetto Corsa, rFactor 2, Automobilista, Dirt Rally, Race Room, etc.   It is a “good looking game, and certainly has a lot of eye candy. It is very much a style over substance. It carries a vast selection of both cars, and tracks, but they fall short simulating the difference. They have no depth.   In other titles, the simulation aspect of each car is immediately noticeable. You feel each car and how it behaves in your hands on different tracks and surfaces. This simply feels numb in most scenarios.  other titles provide better racing, better A.I, better physics, more desirable car selections, and a much, much improved force feedback.   Unless you have exhausted all other options out there, and this is on sale at a cheap (very cheap) price I recommend you save your hard earned money and check-out any of the titles mentioned above.   Do NOT fall for the hype. 6/10
3650	0	a	Project Cars is a fun game. I use my steam contoller as a steering wheel. With refinement, and the recently added rumble functionality, my driving has gotten much better.  Why do I not recommend the game, then?   1 - Tuning setting for cars. This is my biggest issue with this game. The user cannot create and name save files of various tunes for cars. There is the option to create a base tune that is saved to all tracks. Then there is the option to save one tune per car/track combo. That's it. Wanna tune your car for a hot day, and have another tune for the rain? You have to document your setting how you see fit, and manually enter them... each time. Tuning is a very significant aspect of racing. Whether or not a driver is comfortable in his/her car can make all the difference. Sadly, as I understand it, there are no plans to add this ability to the game.  2 - Must restart a practice session, to modify the vehicle tune. This cannot be done on track. You cannot even pull into the pits, to make modifications. Pulling into the pits in a practice session only engages a buggy pit stop.  3 - No vehicle modifications. It would be nice to be able to, at least, make adjustments to wheel width. While there are a wide variety of tunning options, changing parts can make a difference in automotive performance.  4 - AI. The AI appears to be completely oblivious to the player, at times. This, when combined with the inability to organize one's settings how they see fit, killed the career mode for me.  I have not attempted online racing. As such, I am unable to comment on the many bugs reported.  I did want to enjoy this game. Unfortunately, I do not see myself playing it much. Mostly because a racing simulator makes it unnecessarily difficult to tune a car for specific races/conditions.
3651	0	a	Look guys.... Why? Just why? when I want to play Forza 6 I just hit play and race.... when I want to play Project Cars I hit play and half and hour trying to set Xbox controler sensitivity!!!! Because it's idiotic, I doubt that developer even tryed to set it...
3652	0	a	Terrible physics, full of bugs, only like 60 cars, full of DLCs, ridiculosly stupid AI, no way to turn off the ♥♥♥♥in pit assist, dead servers. DONT BUY THIS ♥♥♥♥
3653	0	a	The ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ thing changes my Windows 10 theme to default after each time I play it.  The AI does not give a ♥♥♥♥ if you are on the track, they will drive through you, and shove you out of the way because they can. They will not make any effort to overtake you in a clean way.  Outside of that, the game is great. i'd recommend it, but the fact that it defaults my windows theme has ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off enough to not recomend the game.
3654	0	a	this game and more dont work with steam..
3655	0	a	Bugs. Bugs for days. Changes desktp wallpaper somehow. Freezes mid race. Freezes in menu. Stops responding randomly. See all the reviews, it's always the same thing. Cool game, too many bugs.
3656	0	a	I have spent hundreds of hours with Assetto Corsa, then I bought PC just to enjoy the graphic, the changing weather, the races at night time. Unfortunately the feedback from the car while you drive it, is so dull that I am hardly opening it again. It also has bugs and other issues, yes, but what bugs me is that I don't feel proper car's reactions. If you are used to Assetto Corsa and like it, I would suggest to not buy PC.
3657	0	a	I've put many hours into this game....and I wanted to like it-- in fact, I really did after awhile. Don't get me wrong, there's things I do enjoy about PCars. The fact that they carry more WEC/LeMans/Endurance stuff and there are plenty of liveries available for the vehicles. The track are okay, as lots of the main ones to be considered a serious racing game are available. However, I believe that there isn't enough content in terms of marques and tracks as well as features. Then there's the question of physics....oh dear.....the physics. They aren't bad-- they aren't good, either. They're just.....weird. I race IRL, enough to know that they are just odd. Not quite a simulator, not quite a arcade, but not a hybrid of the two, though. The developer support is nearly absent, and they do put out content from time to time; just to keep the mob at bay sufficiently enough.  Take case in point: I'm racing in the Audi eTron Quattro R18, at LeMans. I'm on Lap 24 of Godknowswhat doing an endurance race. I'm convincingly in first out of A Whole Lotta Cars (cue Zeppelin), with P2 a whole 22 seconds behind. So far it's been a clean race (a true rarity), and I decide to not push it anymore, to which I try to maintain pace and conserve. I come out of the Porsche Curves, and the following section pretty clean. Then approaching the start with NO ONE IN SIGHT, NO DEBRIS, NO CARS, NOTHING, when suddenly out of nowhere my car shatters, flips, spins, and crashes in to a wall....on a straight....as if I just hit an IED or I crashed into a brick wall or something. My car is in total disrepair and I have to will my car past the massive entirety of LeMans. I drive the entire course in 1st or 2nd, trying not to blow out my engine, make it to the pits with just 7 seconds of a lead (down from 22), to get in there only to have the pit glitch, and get stuck there with nothing happening for 10 minutes, to then get booted. I can't stress enough how much weird stuff happens all the time.   The AI is comparable to a bunch of 15 year olds in a Ferrari race car, whom have just received their learners permits. Its clunkily unrefined, and downright head-scratching.   With all the other racing simulators, I can't recommend it wholly as there are better options. If you're looking for an amazing racing experience and a true sim, DIRT Rally is fantastic. (I race rally as well.) Assetto Corsa, although I've never played it, has never really had a uniformly bad thing said about it and I do intend to purchase it soon.  6.5/10
3658	0	a	Worst piece of ♥♥♥♥ ever. Game just stopped working and developer can't give a ♥♥♥♥ why. Hundreds dollar spent flushed down the toilet.
3659	0	a	Insanely glitchy on Steam Link+Controller. Menus were spazzing out, controls would reset to defaults after I set them.
3660	0	a	Don't waste your money. I have bought two different controllers to play this game. The first one, I thought it was the controller that had the deadzone problems. Meaning you could not stear softly, only in large gaps. So I bought an x-box controller think that would solve the problem. Still. Huge dead zones. As far as the 'awesome' graphics. That's an overstatment, I have seen way better graphics on Forza on X-box 360.
3661	0	a	While this may be a great game for the hardcore racer addict, it seems a bit too tedious for the balance of the gaming population. I admire the attention to detail and the depth of the game - and I certainly really appreciate the graphics - but the game lacks finesse in the manner of the career path. The go-kart racing is fun, but I really don't feel the need to star there on my career path. Bottom line, the game requires a great deal of work and a lot of time in order to get anywhere. Let's be honest...I want to have fun...I don't want a second job.
3662	0	a	Good Graphics ,Physics ect ect... but not enough content.. i want to be able to drive alot more that ''mainstream'' cars 6/10 sorry guys
3663	0	a	Just played an hour of this. It is not a casual game, by any stretch of the imagination. This game is made for hardcore enthusiasts.  I found it god awful.  I'm more of a Forza player. I've played hours of Forza, and will play many more hours of it. I will most likely buy the next Forza.  I can say without a doubt, I will not buy the next Project Cars.
3664	0	a	You can hit a wall head on, at 100 mph and keep going like nothing happened. The physics are terrible. This is even more disappointing in a game that is supposedly a 'realistic simulation'.  Definitely avoid this one.
3665	0	a	This game is fun, if you consider it an arcady racing game with simulation elements. As soon as you want a more realistic simulation this game isn't for you. If you want to get into the detailed tuning options for each and every car you can do it, however it will not tremendously affect the way the cars handle. Graphics on the car models are great, but environment graphics leave a lot to be desired.  Unfortunately the AI in this game is absolutely rubbish. It has the urge (on every difficulty setting) to always go for the apex of every corner, regardless of if your car is already side-by-side with them. The second you have to come up through the field to win a race you will get crashed into 100% of the time.  Furthermore, there seems to be some bug with qualifying times. Multiple I have had the issue that I put in a pole-winning lap in Quali, just to get an AI driver besting me by 25-50%... For example: I get a 1:04:30 time on a lap and the AI miraculously gets a 00:38:40... HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?! All the others AI drivers are 2-3 seconds behind my time, but this one guy is 20 SECONDS ahead?
3666	0	a	Graphics and sounds are great but physics and FFB are much arcade compared to Asseto Corssa. So I requested refund and AC is still No. 1 to me.
3667	0	a	This game is generally great, good fun to play and great physics model. However, in the rain in career mode, apparently i'm the only one with grip issues if it rains in the last two laps, thats ♥♥♥♥ poor programming. Damage model is poor, despite insinuation it will be visible it rarely is. The DLC's, cash cow anyone? unless it's on offer, don't bother, as i say with so many games on steam these days.

3670	0	a	No good for the vive ,when you press recenter it puts you in the middle of the car , lags toomuch in vr , i get lower than 45 fps on a 1060 . I would wait until the vr support is better unless you are playing without vr
3671	0	a	I said I would rereview this game after I played a similar racing game. So... Still an OK racing game. Sound like racing cars. Turning sound, burning rubber sounds, and the impact sound are all good. Little voice work, but what did you expect it's a racing game. Sadly there is little music, at times it feels like there is no music at all. The graphics though are great! The scenery looks amazing, not blocky or jagged when going fast or slow. The cars look great! New cars, although they look boring, look like real race cars, my uncle used to be a NASCAR driver so I know what race cars look like. The older cars, which I prefer, look spectacular, I'm just guessing they look this way in real life. This game is missing an identity, it's very generic. 6.5/10 I wouldn't recommend this game because I rated it under a 7, but if you like more realistic racing game you'll most likely love this game.
3672	0	a	bad menu-handling many bugs especially in endurance missing feature for true multiclass or custom grids huge rippoff via dlc  
3673	0	a	Good Game But it could use a Pit crew
3674	0	a	Project Cars could have been a great game, it seems that laziness and an unwillingness to actually spend money on licensing has gotten in the way. Seriously, if I would have paid full retail for this game, I’d be livid. First off, it seems they completely forgot the in race soundtrack, but don’t worry they have brilliantly included Spotify “playlist, because I need more accounts, and extra web browsing windows draining my system resources. Secondly, it seems they forgot to add three-quarters of the cars. Many of the classes feature as many as TWO, that’s right TWO, different cars in the given class! I can hardly handle the variety. Finally: “Gripyear Tires? Really? That might have flown twenty years ago, but it’s just ridiculous. When compared to a nearly twenty year old copy of Gran Turismo, Project Cars comes up thin on cars, and lacks the branding that helps make series like GT, and Forza, feel like the real deal.  When it comes to tuning the cars it feels like an afterthought. Certainly, one of the joys of modern racing games is earning custom parts, whether it’s by spending a racing purse, or an internal R&amp;D process (ala 2003’s APEX Racing from ATARI), but there isn’t any of that going on here. It is spec racing at every level. With those TWO choices per class expect one thing: Monotony.   I can’t completely pan this game. It plays and looks great. The game engine seems to do a great job, and it’s pretty awesome seeing such a full grid, even if the cars are all the same. There are a wide variety of tracks and configurations, and the weather makes things interesting. Racing in a thunderstorm is just as dicey in game, as I imagine it would be in real life. Unfortunately, playing the game is simply a reminder of how good of a game this could have been, had proper effort been put into completing the game, rather than simply building the framework, and then dumping it into the market. It is really disappointing that console gamers still have the only decent options when it comes to a fully developed racing game, but I hold on to hope that maybe in the future, this game engine, or someone else’s, will mature into something that can actually hold my interest for an extended period of time. Until then I’ll putt around in this, or hook up my old PS3, and wistfully dream about what this game could have been. 
3675	0	a	This game has amazing graphics, one of the best in racing titles, but it´s not fair to call this a sim racing game, this game was intended to be played with joypad, if you have a wheel car just doesnt feel real, you have almost no chance in controling the car when it slides a bit, it´s just a very small gap between grip and total uncontrolable rear. Î play sim racing games since gtlegends, and gtr, project cars has a terrible online experience, every idiot can join every race, cars have a bit of lag when online, it´s almost impossible to have real close racing online.  This game is intended to be played offline just to enjoy the graphics, when it comes to ffb things dont seem real.  Conclusion: This aint a simrace title, this is something like grand turismo for Pc.
3676	0	a	Buggy, no logic and you just spin around the track.
3677	0	a	All hype crappy force feedback. Did the developers even listen to the 'real world drivers' that helped develop the game?
3678	0	a	Firstly, thousands of players of this game will give it positive reviews no matter what, as they backed the game years ago with anywhere between £20-£500 each(even more in some cases) and have become viral marketers and have a profit share to think about, so they want everyone to buy it, and will tell you whatever you want to hear.  If you're expecting a sim, look elsewhere. If you're looking for great battles with clever AI, definately look elsewhere. If you own an NVidia GPU and are looking for a racing game with plenty of eye candy, decent FFB, decent handling and physics (with assists turned off unless your looking for a full arcade experience) then you might want to give this a try, but not at full price, possibly worth picking up for £25 or less if you must have every racing game.  As a sim it falls way short of the following sims (that ive played): iRacing, Race07 (+ expansions), Stock Car Extreme, rFactor2, Kart Racing Pro.  As a Single Player game it falls short of the following games (that ive played): Grid Autosport, Stock Car Extreme, Race07 (+ expansions).  As a Multiplayer game it just fails full stop, same as Assetto Corsa, if they are hoping for a thriving online community then they need to revamp most of thier MP stuff and network code as the rubber banding and warping makes playing with anyone outside of your country almost impossible.  If they focus on making the AI anywhere near decent and removing those rubbish made up 'tracks' like california highway that has 'guide rails' down both sides of the road (replace with more irl race tracks instead), as well as fixing the assists so when using 'real', cars that actually have ABS, TC and SC irl will have those options in the cars setup (havnt come across a single car yet that has these options in the setup even though they have them irl and real is selected in the game options), then they might have a game on their hands that can start competing alongside the games i mentioned above. The only racing game/sim i would currently rate this above (if it was the same price) is Assetto Corsa, and thats mainly down to the poor optimization and horrible,disjointed UI and useless multiplayer in AC.
3679	0	a	Don't believe the hype - wait for it to be on sale.  While it runs buttery smooth on Nvidia Hardware and has the greatest Force Feedback I have ever felt... the game itself is not that special. Nothing I have never seen before, nothing I have ever played before.  The motivation on proceeding in the campain is not really there, the sound effects are not very immersive and the highly praised graphics arent really that special either. While the car models are out of this world, the rain effects are a joke (compared to the ones in DriveClub that came out one year earlier on a console), the tracks are really ugly, lifeless and. undetailed, even GRID Autosport did a better job with those.  Project Cars also suffers from flickering shadows and textures, this is especially noteable on the speedometer in the 91 BMW M3 E30 Group A.  I really wanted to like it but I just can't.
3680	0	a	Bad, bad, bad.  Really buggy, some absolute game breaking bugs (i.e. not registering your lap, so when cars behind you cross the start/finish they go ahead of you on the leaderboard. You finish the race and only notice when the race results come up that you finished last, not first, even though you crossed the line first!).  They have some people providing 'support' (I use the term losely) on Steam forums, ask them for very basic information (such as when the game you paid for might actually start working) and they refuse to answer unless you create an account on their forum. Either provide support on Steam or don't, don't use it to click build your own forum! There's no reason you can't answer simple questions (such as when a patch for the gamebreaking bugs might be forthcoming!!!).  They are also playing silly sods with hardware (well documented, have a search); the game was clearly coded to run well on Nvidia hardware, leaving ATI users out in the cold. By all means feel free to optimise your game for one, but don't just shrug your shoulders and think it isn't your problem to make YOUR code run on very standard hardware. Telling people they should buy Nvidia to fix your buggy code is frankly stupid!   
3681	0	a	I tried 10minutes with carting. Jesus mother of christ that was terrible!! Shame on you for making such crap in 2015!
3682	0	a	Ok, so there are some good bits.  Graphics are good and bad at the same time.  Good textures, awful effects. For example, the McLaren P1 DRS wing doesn't move an inch when braking or cornering, the same for other DRS cars. This is pure laziness and poor development. Assetto Corsa is a great competitor, with better sounds and effects.  Car sounds are also awful, I'm pretty sure they've used nearly the same sound for every car. Let’s use the McLaren P1 as an example again, the V8 in the McLaren has a very unique sound, this does not come through at all in this game.  Lots of lazy dev, awful for AMD users (I'm Nvidia, but it's unfair to have poor performance because you use AMD!) Overall, I’d avoid giving this studio any money.
3683	0	a	I think this may be the nail in the coffin for me when it comes to buying games from this point forward. Just like Assetto Corsa, this feels and plays like a game that was released to the general public still blatantly in beta form. This isn't finished. The gameplay is dreadfully buggy, the graphics are glitchy in almost every race and replay (I'm on a GTX 970), the list of cars at this time is severely uninspiring bordering on uninteresting and forgettable... If I'm honest I can't see a single feature in this game which makes it stand above any other racing 'sim' in the genre. To add to the list, the force feedback on a Thrustmaster TX Wheel is terrible, you need to meticulously fiddle with dozens of settings per car to even just begin to touch on something realistic, I can't feel any understeer, there's no tyre noise, it's really not good at all.  Changing any graphical setting requires a client restart which then makes you sit through the opening splash screens each time, there's no explanation anywhere on what the settings means (you shouldn't have to Google a game setting), car customisation is non-existent to the point whereby it's not even obvious how to race a car in a different paint colour... which is fine if this was a hardcore sim, but it isn't, technical customisations and upgrades are minimal. To be fair, on its own merit as a racing game it's pretty good in terms of graphical quality and physics. However. It's been released AFTER the likes of iRacing, Assetto Corsa, Forza, it has to compete and offer something they don't... and it doesn't. In my book, it's failed. If you enjoy Assetto Corsa on PC and Forza on Xbox (I don't own a PS), do not buy this. You'll be bored within an hour and will fast realise there's nothing for you here that you can't have in a game you already own. It's £40 wasted for me.
3684	0	a	First of all: Dont buy it if you have AMD components in your computer, it is as unoptimized as can be, so even with a high end graphics card, you'll be stuck playing on low or medium.  Aside from that: -The graphics look fairly nice, I mean, if you enjoy not seeing a single piece of asphalt because of the effects blinding you.  -The damage model is awful, you can run straight into a wall at 120mph and all that happens is your splitter falling off. -There arent 110 UNIQUE Tracks as mentioned by the devs, there are about 30 with alot of different variations and reverse layout -There is only a handful of cars, used to be a fairly decent amount during the beta, most of the content was taken out because it was 'not finished' -This game is as much of a simulator as Call of Duty is tactical -Devs have not updated the game since 2 weeks after release, yet there are many bugs and glitches that have to be fixed -Game settings sometimes dont save -Main Menu displays unfinished content in a finished game -Multiplayer server browser has very little filter options, as well as informations for clients wanting to join a race -16 max players in a Multiplayer lobby -Almost every car handles the same -Have I mentioned this is NOT A SIMULATOR? -AI is either overly aggressive or doesnt overtake at all -Its Shift 2 with a few new tracks and cars -Tracks arent detailed enough -Cant to pit manually -Developer had an estimated budget of 18million dollars, yet they did not license any single seater class and alot of racetracks -Multiplayer has connection issues, softlocks at race begin, ignores input from additional shifters  On the bright side: it looks nice, if you really want to spend that much money on Shift 2, then go ahead  And please stop referring this as a SIMULATOR, just because the dev claims it is, and the cars handle extremely poor, its not a simulation
3685	0	a	UPDATED REVIEW FOR PATCH 2.0  My PC specifications, Windows 7x64, i7 4GHz, GTX980 12GB ram &amp; Thrustmaster T500 RS &amp; Xbox PC Controller.  Graphics The game looks good, weather and cars especially look good, environment graphics however look like something I would expect from indy development. Also if your not running graphics at ultra (I get 25 to 50FPS range depending on complexity of track with a GTX980 set at ultra - aura coast compared to brands hatch). The cars while looking great, are too clean compared to their environments, they need to get dirty more, have imperfect textures get dust on them etc (see asseto corsa etc). Excellent view choices from cockput, bonnet +++ best I've seen on a racing game.  Audio Still has glitches, or is it trying to simulate car body hitting floor making odd noises at times, no idea! Going through a tunnel no matter what the size puts all audio through a huge reverb and echo effect which really pulls you out of the immersion of the game.  Track They look good but to be ohnest there isn't much to them really, however 1 really big issue. Back in the old school days racing games would put collision on the sides of the track so you can never leave the track no matter what (given a little buffer / space), project cars does this. Try driving off the track even a little on one of the non racing circuits.  Gameplay Career mode starts with carts, every car race circuit time I done was invaidated as I apparently cut the track or drove off it even without having doing this. This is not so bad with the normal cars however. Carts feel very mario cart with the corner turning angles. I kept getting endless laps and blue flag to let an invisible car past to which it then says go go go!  Force Feedback Absolute rubbish, how can they take such a long time to develop this game and get the force feedback so very wrong. Curbs have greater force feedback than barriers and walls. This hasn't been fixed in patch 2.0 but the steam forums have some people whom have made fixes themselves for the game, which have made it more playable.  XBox controller on PC Patch 2.0 has improved on this, or it was either a result of me spending over an hour trying out settings. Seems the universal scale of the higher the number the higher the sensitivy is the other way around for this game. Still it's far from perfect but it's playable, if you can put up with stuff like that. And not having the ability to change these settings from race menu but only from main menu drove me up the wall!   Final thoughts If you haven't already got Asseto Corsa, Grid Auto Sport or RaceRoom Experience (free) and Race 07 then I suggest get them first. Project cars has been in development for years and a lot of the bugs even with patch 2.0 have not been fixed, the game is still very much in beta. I also cannot forgive any racing game or developers of a racing game that release a racing game where the force feedback is a disaster, even after patch 2.0 it's still an issue.   For the price and development time put into this game I was expecting something so much more, the car graphics are excellent the rest is last last gen AAA or indy game quality. The graphics push my 980 considerably set on ultra even though I don't see anything that should be pushing it that hard.  The game just feels like it's still in beta.  I can only hope that it works correctly for VR on the HTC Vive or the Oculus Rift, but I'm pretry certain I wont be able to run it on ultra for that 90 FPS VR requirement.  Graphics: 7/10 Sound effects: 4/10 Music: 9/10 Force Feedback: 4/10 XBox Controller: 2/10 Gameplay: 5/10 Track selection: 9/10 Car selection: 7/10 Bugs: 7/10 = 3/10 positive Price: 2/10  Score: 52%  I would recommend that you wait till it's on sale and the game is on patch 4 or 5.
3686	0	a	I bought this game during Slightly Mad Studios buy-in early access at around Build 200-ish. Followed it until build 400 when I refunded it because I didn't feel the game was going to achieve it's goals of producing a comprehensive accessible racing simulation for everyone.  I pre-ordered it again before release, figuring I'd give this game a chance and I'm bitterly disapointed. I'm getting serious NFS Shift vibes from this, but it isn't all bad.   Pros
3687	0	a	The race directors given you a warning for slightly going off the track when you were trying to avoid an accident and so has penalized you by slowing you down for five whole seconds so that you have no choice of catching up to the rest of the pack. I love this game. So fun.
3688	0	a	Rubbish... says its a sim but its far from a sim, also its not even finished yet it still in beta stage.....  Sorry but i wouldnt recomend...
3689	0	a	After all the hype i thought this game was going to be good.  Graphics are good but that about it, i just dont want to play it very boring.  Owell have to wait for forza 6.
3690	0	a	buggy, unfinished, ai is crap, should have bought AC.
3691	0	a	Very misleading title, not enough detail of the game in the description, very limited game modes/options, no car customization other than tuning, very little color selection, just overall terrible buy if you're looking for a game to cruise in/customize cars. All in all i'm very disappointed with how ridiculous the steering is in this game and it's very frustrating to even learn how it works.
3692	0	a	The game has to few Cars and Tracks!
3693	0	a	maybe its a good simulation my BIG problems with the game are: -i bought a new racing game to have an active community to have some nice races..my problem is you cant find useful races, there are too many race courses and too less people that you can find a race for the courses you trained  - i dont like any of the cars they implemented in the game, i am a big fan of the WTCC, the cars in the touring sections are a dissapointment  -i enjoy to play a career mode from the low to the top..but karts are just a pain, also in the multiplayer are barely no open kart races, seems nobody like them. i wished they implemented more import or WTCC cars and not theses karts.  Its just my personal opinion on the game, i guess its just not for me. I enjoy RACE07 much much more
3694	0	a	Some racing games I love that mix realism with arcade mechanics. Some racing games I can't stand that try to mix realism/sim with arcade mechanics. Unfortunately, this is one of the games that just doesn't work for me. I love arcade racers like Crazy Taxi, Mario Kart, Distance, Forza Horizon 2, GRID, and Need for Speed Most Wanted/Burnout Paradise. I absolutely love realistic sims like GTR2, RACE ON, F1 Challenge 99-02, F1 2013, Assetto Corsa, and etc... I really enjoyed Forza Motorsports 5 (Half realism/Half arcade) and Drive Club (same as Forza 5). This game is utter crap compared to Forza, Test Drive Unlimited, DriveClub, Gran Turismo 5, Forza Horizon 2, GRID Autosport, and almost every single other racing game. Very dissapointed by the game mechanics. Also, the game runs very poor on my desktop i5, 8gb ram, and Nvidia GTX 960 2GB Video Card. Bad game. Another awful racing game. Moving on...
3695	0	a	this is game is (*note* my expectations were high) - quite boring - beatified 'shift 2' - doesn't have subarus or other common vehicles except ford focus rs - controller sensitivity sucks and there's no sweet spot, e.g. slightest throttle blip on my xbox controller causes WOT acceleration - it is harder to keep control of car than in assetto corsa, e.g. at one point in game i couldn't avoid renault clio from wiping out on downhill and slighest turn - real world tracks are BORING - the game engine does very nice job with weather, reflections, and other shader effects, unlike assetto corsa that supports only 1 light source (sun) and can't have night tracks / reflections etc...LoL - overall it is a good quality near-sim for right folks, i enjoy DRIVECLUB on PS4 a whole lot more.
3696	0	a	I'll try to keep this short but thorough.  I have been part of the testing phase since pre-alpha. The game has improved inifinitely throughout its development - as it should have done. I REALLY wanted to like this game!  Positives: Weather effects, day/night time options, graphics and immersive UI are all best in class.  That said, the game does not feel finished. The AI is my biggest gripe. Cars do not respond to your position. The AI in this game is comparible to that in Gran Turismo. They stick to the racing line whether you're in the way or slower.  I am a seasoned driver on iRacing and Assetto Corsa and the physics in those games is definitely mroe believable. The handling in Project CARS definitely feels scripted which is something I've heard a lot of people say.  I play with a G27 with no assists and the AI difficulty on 100% and I finish most races (set to 2 laps mostly) with a lead of about 7 seconds (not intending to sound like a ...)  What we need is the career of Project CARS with the physics and FFB of Assetto Corsa and the online/competitivity of iRacing!    FINAL WORD: I would recommend Assetto Corsa over this game personally, though Project CARS has a lot going for it.
3697	0	a	HARD!! unless your a die hard racing game this baby is tough. it also lacks the upgrade system that makes most racing games a lot of fun. And you wont find any cars you can drive on the street in here, All race cars
3698	0	a	Game has great potential as a semi-sim like Shift series. Graphics are fine, time of day progression is awesome, cars feel good... BUT! But it's clear the 'release' was rushed. FFB is all over the place and needs serious tweaking to be considered acceptable, car settings resetting at will, AI phuqs up or cheats on a regular basis, some tracks award you with 'off-track penalty' for no reason -- lots of stuff isn't working as supposed. Oh, and that ability to consult with a race engineer for car tuning? Ability, that is listed in the 'digital manual', many times mentioned in the game itself and was part of advertising program? Well it's NOT done. Customer fraud at it's worst. So, should you buy this game? Definitely!.. on 2015 Christmas sale -- maybe it'll get into shape by that time. For now -- stick to Assetto Corsa or something else. Don't touch this half-ready product.
3699	0	a	I was looking for something like Forza for PC, it can't even compare. Trying to tune a car is almost a lesson in engineering, plus a lesson in metrics/obscure measurments for Imperialists. The cars handle like they're on sheet ice. Traction control, ABS, pretty much all the assists are useless. There is no way to turn off penalties for going off track and whatever the game bases 'off-track' is screwy to the point pulling out hair. It makes qualifying more tedious than it should be. Tried using a 360 controller, buggy to say the least. Had to upgrade to a One-wired for the game to even work. Disappointed overall.
3700	0	a	Looks and sounds great but the car and cart handling reminds me of Grid, bad, and that killed it for me. Update: PLayed agian and it's stil pretty bad. Only thing I can say is that it has great graphics and car selection. Sorry if I hurt the feelings of Fan Boys...
3701	0	a	I didn't end up liking the game despite funding it's development. What's neat however, is I still get a few bucks every few months in my Paypal from these guys. If I had any idea my $12 investment would turn into $30+, I'd have invested much more.
3702	0	a	The game feels like it is still an early access game. The Bots drive like maniacs and insist on driving on their racing line no matter what or who is on it. The racing line itself matches maybe two vehicles in the whole game, any other car has to brake at some other point. The Pit is empty, except for that one guy that seems to change your tires (without animation btw), fill up your car and at the same time hold the 'brake' sign in front of you. Sometimes the Pit is so buggy that you cannot even get out of it. The Pit menu is everything but easy and intuitive, this seems to be a genral problem in the game. The weather animation looks nice but does not seem to affect your tires since, if you choose the usually appropriate tires for this weather they overheat massively.  The online mode is not perfect as well and you have to make a new lobby after every game, if you want to change anything.
3703	0	a	In the short time I played the game I found it to be buggy. The cars would consistently jerk left or right without driver intervention, and cost me several races as a result. Even on Manual Transmission settings the car still shifts for you. The graphics are a positive, but there is no way to design your own livery without photoshopping one and importing it into the game. Overall the game is ok at best, and needs more patches and attention to become what it should have been.
3704	0	a	Did not live up to the hype. New sequal anounced and monthly cars not free. Lack of car content. Waste of money for the price ,
3705	0	a	Wish I had not bought it awfull game I don't even think the graphics are nice and the physics are crap! How do you get a refund on steam?
3706	0	a	Impossible to enjoy crap game wasted $60.  
3707	0	a	This game is horrible. Not very realistic at all. Only if you have the specific brand hardware, it is just eye candy and that's it.
3708	0	a	Fix the AI
3709	0	a	Look at that shiny asphalt, wow look at the beautiful rain droplets on the screen, look those soft wavy grass. It's a beautiful looking game, but that's all that I can say about it. The physics feels weird, either that or the game is not controller friendly. Asseto Corsa and DiRT Rally plays pretty well with a controller. Project CARS has a better UI than Asseto and better ingame graphics, but that's about it. PCars should still be in early access, or should have a lower price tag. The game isn't perfect and the studio has already announced Project Cars 2. Thank lord Gaben for Steam refunds.
3710	0	a	As a SCCA hobbist in real life I felt a game like this would be right up my alley. I quickly realized that I was wrong and the 'sim' my be too sim-ish for the worst. Any car in any class handles horribly even when turning off all driving aids like TCS and ABS, selecting a full manual gearbox. I was using a X Box One game pad but just the slightest bit of movement would over steer and there is a huge dead zone on the accelarator. Over all this game is horrible in comparison to other games I have played like the Gran Turismo or the Project Gotham Racing series. Plus I couldn't find any type of way to paint your car to a color you like just ugly pre-picked racing schemes. Maybe I was just not seeing it in the menu. That is another BIG problem with this game the menus. They are so busy it is hard to tell what to do in career mode. Took about 10 minutes to figure out how to join a race. Over all not the best and I quickly requested a refund after 40 minutes of play time. Sorry Project CARS but I give you a 3/10.
3711	0	a	For control, this is the worst racing game I have ever had. Moreover, the ui of game menu is really POOR designed! If you use mouse, that would be fine; but if you use controller to navigate, you would have completely on idea what to do next, which button should be pressed.  The car parameter is also in bad design. No comparison with other cars; car performances are only shown in digits, that means you can't get the first impression when overviewing them. The only advantage of the game is the graphic quality. Full details on your own and your opponents.
3712	0	a	Project Cars is the worst money I've ever spent on anything. Look beautiful all you want but if I wipe out on every corner no matter how hard I try, 'it's a simulation game' is not a good excuse for bad physics. I'd like a refund please.
3713	0	a	Thinking of playing this game with a controller? Don't bother. Controller configuration options are confusing with no explanations for the many different settings. Cars feel like they are tanks with lots of input lag or so twitchy that one miniscule tap of the stick sends the car veering off course. I looked at many youtube videos and forum posts (pretty bad when I have to do that for information instead of the game itself).  As of this review, I have had 5 hours play time, about 2 hours of which must have been spent configuring the controller settings; the game has also crashed 9 times.  The game looks great and has potential but as of yet the controller settings are a nightmare and as such this game has been a total waste of money for me. Hold onto your money until issues are resolved.
3714	0	a	In it's current state, I would not recommend this, far too many bugs and problems that will leave you frustrated. However, once the game actually gets finished it has the potential to be incredible.
3715	0	a	its a good game at the end of the day but it is broken in so many ways its hard to explain. just watch the videos. and no one is saying the wrongs in the game with fear of being band by head Ian, whom no one seem to like and we need a change i dont recomend spending money on this game till we weed out everything wrong with the game in all aspects. the graphic engine is not built for amd and was done with the knowledge they were doing it to help nvidia the only supporters of the game on the graphic side. Management banning poeple for speaking out. and to pay 50 60 dollars and 2 weeks later it drop to 39. is a terible pill to swallow no i dont recomend it unless you hate i racing and get that away from steam. all these extra charges is ridiculous... 
3716	0	a	Well first time i saw the game it seemed to be the best realistic car simulator! When i payed for that i was sure i will not regret I was so wrong! First of all the graphics and the sount are fantastic the design of the cars also realistic and beutiful but when you start a reace... every thing goes wrong the game is so punishing! cuse if you dont got a whele controller the game is imposable to play the car get outbalanced at strait road! So for me its a waste of money cuse i just wanted have fun and play a VIDEO GAME and not trying to punish my self and dout if this is how i drive in real life And now codmasters Please show me that DRIVERS that tried the game and told you that this is how cars react so i can slap cam them for that lie!
3717	0	a	A good 'GAME', I would not say it's an simulator YET. There is a lot of space for improvements. Some thinks I would like are  - enable us to choose the beautiful colors of the cars - enable the chase camera to be fixed in one position even while driving fast - enable to drive out of the pits manualy - enable joining a session without having to wait untill the next one  The list could go on. Negative feedback just so I'm sure someone will read it. 
3718	0	a	I got a female ♥♥♥♥♥♥ when i jump back to Assetto Corsa.  10/10 would female ♥♥♥♥♥♥ again.
3719	0	a	Well, the helpful, informative review I gave this game, with reasons why I thought the way I did, was consistently downvoted as unhelpful.. so, the Steam Community has spoken, and asked for a meaningless and pointless review instead. So here it is.  3/10 Would waste my money again. Not.  
3720	0	a	dont waste your money on this game, graphics dont look like the trailers at all even on max settings, and for whatever reason whenever you touch the brake pedal the car will instantly spin out.
3721	0	a	Don't buy it till they fix it for AMD cards.
3722	0	a	I've spend 3 hours messing with controller settings and still steering is very awful (I'm using PS3 controller). Sometimes it feels like the cars have a mind on its own and if you touch the grass - the race is over. Career mode starts getting boring very fast. The game just throws you a bunch series of races, that doesn't feel different from each other. After you win a race, it doesn't feel like you won something. Even after you win the whole season you just get a well-made 3D model of a trophy, of which you can take a screenshot or you never see it again, so there's nothing that makes you play the game again. For now this game is just a simulator for taking pretty screenshots.

3725	0	a	First impressions on the game: Driving is just about the best experience i had so far (in a sim). Graphics are stunning. The game runs as smooth as i was expecting.  Although:  After waiting 7 months on successive delays 'to deliver a finished and polished' game, they didn't quite get there. Why?  1. So, after several tries on Time Trial to set my best time (on California Highway Full, with a 12C GT3), with no penalties at all, i couldn't get the time to get saved. Glitch?  2. After being on the Time Trials for a while, i decided to start the career. Guess what, first race is supposed to be with karts agains AI opponents, on a track for Karts (don't remember the name), i tried to get in the race for like 3 or 4 times and i was always getting with a Kart on California Highway, alone. Quit the game, got back to it, and it was all fine - Kart, against AI, on a Kart track. 3. Not sure if this is a feature or not, but i find it super annoying that when on the pole position, it always sets the car on 1st gear. There are two different cam views while waiting for the green light. If you switch to N while on the first cam and start throttling, when the cam automatically changes, it switches the gear to 1st, which, if you're throtling, will get you desqualified as you start racing before the green light.   Besides these 3 annoying little things, the experience ingame is absolutely fantastic.  EDIT:  Been trying the game a little more and no, i'm sorry but this is a beta that SMS pushed out just to get the money from the pre-orders. this game has so many glitches and bugs that is just starting to be annoying.  just give a look at pCARS forums before you buy the game, and look at all the issue reports. (and worse, the answers 'this is a known issue, we are looking into it'.. details like people getting penalties for being pushed out of track from behind, or after getting out of the pit stops.. no tire sound in most of the tracks.. issues with non responsive pedals.. tire marks 10cm above/ away from the road.. the list goes on.. it's pretty frustrating to play with some of these issues. when they don't show, it's all ok, but otherwise, just makes me super mad at the game!
3726	0	a	This might be an amazing game with a wheel, but the gamepad controls are miserable. No amount of adjustment could dial this game in for me. The controls were either too twitchy or not responsive enough. In addition the recklessly aggressive AI and not quite right physics make it hard to be successful. In comparison of other great racing games like Assetto Corsa, Forza, or Shift the cars have absolutely no feel, so when you're racing on the ragged edge you don't know you've gone to far until the car spins. Can't recommend it in the current state.
3727	0	a	First impressions review!   The racing and the ambience looks great.   The driving feels different for each car. But not all cars drive like they should, i guess you can set it up properly. So it looks like this will require some time to do it right. Nothing for: let's just have some quick racing fun. More advanced settings needed to race each/all car(s).  KI Racers, like other racing games. They don't make mistakes, but are also not pro drivers. I did either win or was last depending on how good i know the car and the circuit and depending if i have made one mistake or none.  The menu is crap. Doesn't even recognize my mouse (not visible). I had to use -dx9 for the launch options in steam to get it windowed and able to do some settings. Looks very much like a console port eventhough it isn't.  Keyboard? Forget it, cant drive with it. You need a steering wheel.  I have multiscreens, but the loading behaves differently each time when loading the game. Sometimes occupies all screens sometimes just one.  Summary: Great graphics and settings. Everything else is average or below. Good game for advanced racing gamers. For all others - don't buy it. Price is for the number of problems i encountered simply too high. Therefore overall, don't buy.
3728	0	a	As both a fan of racing games, and a race car driver myself, this game is pretty spot on with handling. Throttle response, and traction are both very realistic. And the tracks themselves are much more realistic than any other racing game I have played.  Unfortunately this game is very poorly optimized, and unless you have a pretty decent gaming machine, dont expect to be able to use anything but the bottom of the barrel graphical settings. Basically making the game look like GT1. Even more unfortunate is the company behind this game seems to have no concern for this lack of optimization, or the memory leaks that cause you to require a restart of the game every few races.   Currently I have my fingers crossed that the company will pull it together and fix this little project of theirs, or this one will be another to be trumped by the traditional forza and GT.  Conclusion: Dont buy it right now, wait until its fixed. Even all the bells and whistles are not worth all the headache from this game.
3729	0	a	nvidia shillworks nonsense. stay away if you have an amd card.  edit: runs a lot better when paired with an i5 4690k @ 4.3 ghz. you just need a very good cpu if you're going to use an amd video card with this game.
3730	0	a	♥♥♥♥ this ♥♥♥♥ game.
3731	0	a	Confusing menus, too hard to play, no fun.
3732	0	a	The game is ♥♥♥♥ and crashes all the time. Avoid this game like the plague.
3733	0	a	Can't recommend a game where countersteer is non-existant Car sounds are not accurate and shifting doesn't sound like a real transmission would. The weight of the car doesn't feel like it should. The game physics are very questionnable We also shouldn't have to pay for ' car packs ' just fix the game and sell it for more. AI is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ too. The game will punish you for being hit by AI.  Also, AI can drive and do whatever they want without getting the penalties you would get if you did the same. Graphics are good.  3/10   
3734	0	a	This Game is broken for AMD customers, You would hit a cone and it would stay in place before being flung half across the track..... Impressive physics? I think not.... Also being able to muster 45 fps on ultra on 1080p on two 290x just speak volumes of how little optimization they did. I refunded my purchase and spent it on something that actually works!
3735	0	a	I find myself having trouble if I recommend this game or not. It really is hovering around that 3 star range for me. This game does a lot of things right, and brings many interesting things to the table. This game does a lot of things wrong.   Disclaimer: I did not play this game during early access, I'm coming to this game from a full package 1.0 perspective. I am using a G27 Driving Wheel.  I'm a pretty recent racing fan, I've played many of the recents including a brief but intensive stint of iRacing, some Asseto Corsa, and other like games such as Dirt Rally, F1 201X.   So lets start out with what I really love about Project cars. You get a good deal of cars to choose from and generally if its a race car you can think of, its there. When it comes to tracks, the game also has a healthy amount and features the Nurburring which you often don't see in racing games due its length, but I find myself missing tracks like Circuit of the Americas, Lime Rock, and a few others. But don't get me wrong, its a good list of tracks.   Being a real life F1 fan, you hear a lot about karting and it was really neat to have a game that included karting in it and really this leads me to the BEST point about Project Cars in my opinion, its saving grace. The Career mode.  The career mode allows you to start in the lowest of the low (karting) and make your way all the way up to things like Formula 1 (A in the game) . It also allows you to choose your desination from things like touring cars or formula cars. Being able to have this progress really makes the game a rewarding experience and really makes you feel like you're accomplishing something. Games like iRacing obviously have a similarly satisfying progression system but its much less accessible due to the price and the nature of having to be good against other players.   However, although facing AI makes the game more accesible, it also comes with a price. The AI in this game is bad. Not unplayably bad, but not good. If you're the type of person that can not stand AI cheating, you're gunna have a rough time with this game. If you touch grass or gravel you're thrown off the track by some mystical sideforce, no spinning or anything you'd expect. Its just like a giant vaccum just opened up right next to you. AI, on the other hand, have ZERO CONSEQUENCE for going off road. No slowdown, no weird sideforce, nothing. On top of this, AI are very oblivious to your presence. If you are on their racing line they will drive through you even if it ruins both your races in the process. You'll find yourself restarting the races again and again when the AI wrecks you which generally made me make the races as short as possible to compensate. Even with the AI cheating, they're still very bad in certain classes. In karting even at the absolute highest level I found myself crushing the AI as they just took ridiculously slow racing lines and starts. Yet in other classes the AI demolishes you. The difficulty slider really has to be tweaked in each tier to your liking.   Crash physics are extremely weird, if you lift off the ground the game reacts like you just hit a concrete wall 10ft in the air. Damage is inconsistent. Grass slows you down like a sandtrap instead of you sliding. Some cars feel like their center of weight is a lagged pendulum. When I drove in Iracing and wrecked, I always knew why I wrecked. I often found myself wondering WHY am I spinnig in Pcars. I don't know if this is because the physics model is wrong, or if the force feedback is not communicative enough about the vehicle. FFB just seems kinda there as an immersive feature rather than a feature that lets you know what the car is doing.    So! Clearly this game has a lot of problems. I do find myself coming back just for the career mode, and to experience new vehicles. Do I recommend this game? I think it really depends on what you're looking for. If you love Forza and Gran Turismo, this might be the game for you? If you play games like Asseto Corsa and iRacing, be prepared for some major steps back in some areas, but you may still be able to find your own fun somewhere.   Ultimately, I cannot recommend this game for the average racer. If you really like the idea of a career progression, I recommend picking it up, but for the amount of flaws this game has, its just too rough right now to recommend for everyone else
3736	0	a	After playing countless hours of Need For Speed's, Forza's, Midnight Clubs's, and many other racing games, I am not too impressed with this game. Its not exactly a 'bad game', but I find the quality lower than I had expected.  What I liked:  The amount of options (so many options to customize the gameplay) Up to 46 cars at once   What i didn't like:  The graphics look cartoonish, aren't very impressive compared to Forza, which is a CONSOLE GAME. This is PC, since when does a game look better on console, than it does on PC? The handling of the cars Runs horribly on my GTX 970 (overclocked) 
3737	0	a	With ai this bad even in the steam sale this game is not a good buy. Your on a track with other racers but you are actually ivisible to them. So get prepared to be bumped shunted run off the road. Losing patience already have to look elsewhere I guess.
3738	0	a	Xbox360 Controller, almost impossible to drive with... karts are all over the damn place.
3739	0	a	23rd MAY - DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!   Unhandled exception errors all over the place. I have only been able to do a race then the game crashes.  I had high hopes for this game but the errors in the coding mean it's probably going to take some time before I would recommend buying it.   I played it on my friends PS4 and it even crashed on that so I don't think it's hardware based and rather something not right in the code (C++?).  Wait for the updates I guess :-(  I feel more than slightly MAD right now.
3740	0	a	Obviously project cars is a stunning game but I can't help feeling a little disappointed. All I want is to race in amazing cars and in this game there's way too much going on in terms of distracting menu's, options, complicated game play hurdles etc.. But if you're into all that then this game is perfect.
3741	0	a	Only tried this game for a short time.. with an xbox controller... I will say i absolutely hate this game. I only bought it to test with my vr setup... The handling in rain is tap the joystick a tiny tiny bit and ur car does 360 degree spins... its just not a fun game whatsoever.. not realistic.
3742	0	a	Do Not Get its terrible i thought it was good at looking at screenshots and videos but no no DO NOT BUY!!!! U cant upgrade cars or tune or anything and controlls are terrible omgL: JUST NEVER GET THIS SCAM

3744	0	a	I've tried to like this game, But its not a true sim. its more of a arcade sim. its more fun witha controller than a wheel. if your looking for a realistic sim and have fun your much better off going with Iracing or asseto corsa.  If you want a game that feels like forza or gran turismo 5 then this game is for you. fun with controller.

3746	0	a	career mode :-  graphics look great and it runs very well , however a little too complicated to navigate around set up screens  online mode :-  alot of waiting around for sessions to fill or host to start , start a race with 15 players after lap one 7 will leave , after lap 2 lucky if there is still 4 players racing , by end of race you be on the track alone if you are in first place unless 2nd place is right on your tail,  worst online gaming experience ever , unless you are recing a group of friends  summary:-  looks great , runs smooth .tricky to master , lots of waiting around in online mode if your looking for a fun racing game this is not for you, this is a racing sim only for the most anal racers  edit 1 :- after a week of more of playing,and trying to get some value for my money i think i was a little too lenient in my review and feel the need to comeback and state the following :-  more of a waiting sim than a driving sim  graphics periodically freeze for no reason whilst racing making you crash   worst online racing game EVER by far  edit2   had the game for a while now, ive continued to play trying my hardest to ignore all the glitches and waiting online, as i really wanted to like it becauee it looks great, as i've progressed it seems its not a driving sim afterall, its more of a car set up sim, if you dont know how to set the 'what seems loike millions' of car settings then you've got no chance , no matter how good a driver you are , the others will be 7 seconds a lap faster.   final summary :-  looks great , lots of waiting online , lots of glitches , Car set up sim rather than driving sim, awful online gaming  i cant stress enough how awful this online gaming is  wish i'd not wasted my money
3747	0	a	runs like crap on my amd system. I prefer Assetto Corsa for the laser scanned tracks, and the VR actually works
3748	0	a	Boat simulator 2015! No feeling of the back of the car and random frame rate drops, but the game has potential when it's finished.
3749	0	a	Dont buy it! As it seems very promising you get very little content for an extreme amount of money and the game is mostly no fun. Also it wont run smothly and bugfree on nearly any System.  And yes Linux support would be appriciated! The developers take all your money, but you get very leattle in exchange. 
3750	0	a	Not Enough Cars.
3751	0	a	Bought this game thinking It looked stunning and it would be good but I am so disappointed to say i just cannot play it. Using an xbox 360 controller this game is horrible. It is unplayable for me. Cars are just uncontrollable, they are sluggish to turn no matter the settings and they snap back causing constant spin outs. I don't have this issue in any other racing game. Poor show!
3752	0	a	Beautiful game, but way too hard to set up and drive with a standard gamepad or keyboard. I guess this is designed for professional gamers. At least I got it for half price.
3753	0	a	Whilst I enjoy every aspect of this game there is one single problem that ruins it: AI. 1. They don't leave room at all. 2. They touch you and if you don't receive damage you spin uncontrollably and your race is ruined. 3. Going wide or completely off doesn't affect them, for you it will make you shovel time to the AI  The worst thing is the AI are so close to being good, I've had a handful of great battles, unfortunately they have been outweighed by the amounts of races I've restarted due to the horse-♥♥♥♥ moves the AI pull.
3754	0	a	In setting I’m selected keyboard and handbrake is space when I tap the handbrake in game nothing happens. I'm think this is games issue and I hope this problem will be fix. Thank you.
3755	0	a	TLDR   PROS: Decent Graphics, good physics engine, good track selecton  CONS: Little to no automotive content, pay for completion I.E DLC.   Extended Version  Admittedly, I actually didn't spend much time with the game before I wrote this review, but I spent enough time in game to know what this game is missing, and it is missing a lot. Project Cars was also released on the consoles where it's going to go up against two very large and very popular titans. And it's going to get its butt kicked for the very reasons why I am giving the game a neutral/negative review for the PC version. The content available at release is dissapointing and Slightly Mad Studios has gleefully jumped on the DLC bus so that to add to the paltry list of vehicles, you have to pay more.  I admit that I am spoiled by the way things are done in Gran Turismo or Forza, I love being able to take a beater/cheap car and slowly building it up piece by piece. I enjoy driving the street cars more than I do the full blown race cars. I would rather bomb around the track in a Honda that has some extreme performance stree tires, suspension mods and a few engine tweaks than blast around in whatever race car is offered. To me the former is far more entertaining than the latter. I don't understand why that formula hasn't crossed over to the PC sims. And PCars drops the ball here.   The car list is pathetic. I went to hop in a Ford... I had a single option. Thats ONE, UNO, SOLO. Same with BMW. Yay. Where is Honda, Toyota, Nissan, Renault, not to mention Chevrolet. And where are the big boys? Ferrari, Lamborghini, Porsche?   The Project Cars hype campaign promised a lot of things, but Im not seeing it. Essentially, its got some great looking dinnerware, but there is no meat whatsoever on those plates and we're getting water instead of wine.  I wish that there was a neutral option as I don't completely dislike the game and there is hope for it. But Im not impressed enough by it to give it a thumbs up. Thankfully, I did not pay full price for this. Still, Im considering putting Steams refund policy to the test.
3756	0	a	Worst game to play aginst AI, some races there are easy, some races, you can even pass anyone, No consistency, AI is not smart, meaning if something is in front of them, they brake, so hard, you end up at their back, and when touch their back, both cars wont steer, most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ARCADE game ever.
3757	0	a	you'd expect this game to be a realistic driver simulation, instead its just another arcade. the way the cars behave on track is not realistic. you'd think the amount of money these idiots spend they woul'd consult professional drivers on the handling of these vehicles. pathetic. NOT THE GAME FOR THE TRUE DRIVING FANATICS. Rather go for F1 or Forza.
3758	0	a	Very nice but requires a lot of fixes. I am crashing on a black screen all the time. PC Class AAA.  Second day of the game and it is dead on black screen. Sad.
3759	0	a	Broken on Intel I5-4690k, R9 390. It simply crashes when initialising, it isn`t even the first time, before the last time they updated the game it was only playable in windowed mode and you couldn`even change it in the settings. It was fun for several months but not anymore
3760	0	a	Wish I could but I can't. VR optimization is horrendous, at the moment at least for the Vive. Standard game is absolutely stunning, visually speaking, never got around to the rest of the game since I was hell bent on playing it in VR. If they were to patch it to make 90 FPS in VR with the HMD settings it currently recommends then I would lose my life to this game and become a fanboy till the end of my days. You can tell from the experience and the moment you load into the driver's seat of a car that this could change the way we game forever, then I go to drive and realize I'm dangerously close to having my first ever epileptic seizure if the framerate drops any lower. It can't be properly explained the amount of satisfaction you feel when you're sitting in that driver's seat and conversely the dissapointment that floods through you when you realize that's about all you can do comfortably. If they don't release a well-optimized patch for VR, which they surely don't have to since I've already bought their product along with many others, then it'll just sit in my library collecting dust with the rest of the dissapointing games I've bought along the way because there are other and arguably better, depending on personal preference of course, racing games out there if VR is not a selling point for you.

3762	0	a	I have had so many crashes and problems with this game, i wouldn't recommend this to hitler. Your VR update broken my ♥♥♥♥ing game. I can't see any video. Fix your ♥♥♥♥. Prior to that, random crashing to desktop. Not impressed with your developers at all.
3763	0	a	The cars are just impossibe to drive, and the AI is stupid. They just push me aside, or crash into me from the back with such force that I fly out of the track. One example which happened today: the AI crashed into me from the back, I spun around, and crashed into the car behind me. Boom, disqualified!
3764	0	a	This is completely unacceptable. One of the glitchiest games i've played in a long time.   When the car is pre race and driving by itself, it gets jammed behind stuff resulting in me starting the race wayyy behind the other drivers.  Sometimes the game decides to not respond to my pedals, be fine with the buttons and half respond to the steering wheel (G27 Logitech)... this happens every 4th race and is completely game breaking.   Not sure how this has 'mostly positive' reviews tbh. Glad I didn't buy this when it was £40, but still feel like £16 was wasted :(  Great game in theory, but unfinished. Do not buy.
3765	0	a	Used to be a good game when it released. Now I can't even find a server with players in it to race with - not because they dont exist, but because the server browser system is ALL screwed up. It has filters that do...absolutely nothing, not that it matters because the entire list is only empty games. Even when trying to join a friends game via invite, it takes FOREVER to join IF you dont get an error while joining. When the game 1st came out this was not an issue at all - but they made their money now, and dont care about support anymore.    I dont buy games for single player.  This game as well as Star Citizen have taught me to never buy games from non-mainstream publishers, as much as I hate EA.
3766	0	a	Continues Freeze on race loading is the most annoying thing and thats all this useless junk game does !!! 
3767	0	a	The traction in this game is a joke. My economy sedan with old tires has more grip on the road than these racecars do. Anyone that's actually driven a sports car could tell you that they grip like crazy, meanwhile this game has you skidding out of a corrner if you do more than 60kph. Ridiculous.
3768	0	a	Go get Assetto Corsa, Project Cars is not even close to a racing sim, too easy to drive, only 1 'TV' camera for replays, graphics look too sharp it is not realistic; I can see a 12 year old having fun with this one, I think thats their market.
3769	0	a	good sounds, graphics and tracks. But the handling and car selection is ♥♥♥♥♥. On that bombshell not worth the full price.
3770	0	a	I've played almost 100 hours of Assetto Corsa and decided to buy this thinking it may be a good addition to my racing simulator collection but the force feed back is horrible compared to Assetto Corsa. You can't even adjust the suspension systems or anything like you can in Assetto Corsa. Assetto Corsa allows you to adjust almost everything you would be able to adjust in real life. The track selection is actually better than Assetto Corsa and so is the car selection (yet you can't adjust/tune ANY of the cars). The graphics aren't optimized so you'll run at lower FPS than you really should be. The car interiors look better than Assetto Corsa. The Lotus Type 49 is almost literally impossible to drive in a straight line with all default settings for my G27 and the force feed back while I have spent nearly 15 hours driving that car in Assetto Corsa and have nearly mastered it. Mod support is horrible, while Assetto Corsa has mods up the wazoo.
3771	0	a	I have a Fanatec 911 racing wheel, and I've played Forza 3, 4 and Horizon, GT5, etc... But this game is shallow, very shallow. Like there's no soul in this game: I have no motivation to play this. It's like drinking a glass of water, when you really expect to be eating a hamburger. This game is a SOLID 'technical game' but it isn't what I consider fun whatsoever. Steer clear of it if you can. This game is a dud.
3772	0	a	Despite being graphically stunning and fun to play on occasion I find the lack of car models and makes quite dissapointing when compared to other racing games on the market aswell as little to no customization of vehicles i would only recommend this game for those who are looking for a racing simulator but not for someone looking for a fun racing game to just pickup and play

3776	0	a	Terrible with DK2 and AMD setup
3777	0	a	X360 controller &amp; Project Cars. No.
3778	0	a	It looks awesome at it was fun for the time i played but unfortunately i had crashes after every single race. I started a research on it and tried to figure out whats the problem. But i couldn't fix it and cannot recommend this game from this point of view. Thanks to steam i could claim this game.
3779	0	a	Hey project cars what the ♥♥♥♥s going on after the update 10 the game wont load fix it.
3780	0	a	This game is just terrible, do not waste your money on it.
3781	0	a	I give this game 0/10 just because of Ian Bell. Oh, and game is boring as ♥♥♥♥ (and buggy as well), there are much better car simulations out there.
3782	0	a	This game was clearly designed for pressure sensitive buttons, if you don't have them then it gets frustrating rather quickly since you'll either be throttling to the max, or not at all, same with braking
3783	0	a	This game has been released for almost a year and there somehow seems to be more bugs than there were on release date; and there were a LOT of bugs on release date.
3784	0	a	It crashes all the time. I tried to returned but Steam don´t let me.
3785	0	a	I bought Project Cars after having recently purchased Dirt Rally, unfortunately after playing Dirt - of which the car handling is very realistic - playing project cars is somewhat of a dissapointment. The car handling and sounds are nowhere near realistic, ok as a playstation arcade game sort of thing but nothing like what you would exprience in a real car. If the sounds were good at least I could forgive the basic physics for an easy to pick up type game, but the sounds are just plain rubbish - nothing exciting or powerful. I woulld only purchase this as an arcade type game, definately not as a simulator which has left me dissapointed with my purchase. Play Diry Rally, then this. I'm sorry but i can't recommend buying this.
3786	0	a	Im playing it on Xbox one and that's why it doesn't show that much time logged here.  I just got the G920 with stick shifter yesterday, then I bought for approx. $100 worth of PCars with some addons as ive read that it has some very realistic elements in it.  In my view it does have some nice driving physics, but unfortunately it falls very short in other ways.  First off, the selection of cars aren't really too impressive and most of them (all but one or two) are overbuffed up racing versions with insane amounts of power. There're no common road cars in stock trim and that's a shame as I love race with that stock GTI hot hatch.  There are more or less +/- all the usual tracks (those that are in every racing game) so that's what one would expect.  PCars beat Forza 6 on one front only and that's the driving experience, its not that much different, but some parts just feel more refined.  PCars is really overpriced, because getting the top version and all the addons is roughly the same cost as the top version of Forza 6 and besides some slightly more refined driving physics, PCars is a total disappointment compared to Forza 6.  Do I regret that I bought it? Somewhat yes, because I have to admit, that if I had been able to try the game before I bought it, I wouldn't have bought it.....well maybe if the price had been at least somewhat reasonable, like $20 or so.
3787	0	a	Let's get one thing straight: the gameplay itself is perfect for a racing simulator. There are loads of tracks to choose from, and many cars. Customization options with regards to time, weather, lap amount, difficulty are top notch.  The reason I do not recommend this game is the amount of effort it takes to get it to work: - On my first PC the game would not start up at all, simple error message and back to desktop. After two days of trying out different drivers, the game finally launched. ANY GPU drivers newer than 09/2015 would NOT work, so my other games had to suffer in performance.  - My newer PC has the same problem, but this time there are no more legacy drivers that the game will boot with, leaving me unable to play the game.  YMMV, on a friend's PC the game runs just fine, without any issues. Just be warned that the game may not run for you at all, or you'll have to spend a few days trying to fix the issues.
3788	0	a	It's good as just a racing game but as something where you want to play a story, I'd recommend doing more research on racing games.
3789	0	a	Boring, not fun to play.  The cars don't steer well.
3790	0	a	Boring, not fun to play.  The cars don't steer well.
3791	0	a	Can't play at all due to some stupid access violation error
3792	0	a	Terrible game. Various inconsistancies with controls and terrible stuttering makes the game unplayable.
3793	0	a	- spin out simulator. most worst physics for having fun, cause you spin out and have no traction (the car moves even when its stopped just from turning the front wheels left or right). Since you spin out just from driving for no reason, if you hit other ppl or slightly tap them you will spin out like crazy, its like driving on ice but WORSE.  Meanwhile the cpu drivers go through dirt without reduced speed and while not losing any traction at all.   + graphics make me realize i need a better than 1080p display to fully appreciate them
3794	0	a	Cars are hard to control even with a wheel my game crashed multiple times (I know my computer sucks soewhat) even with a wheel the cars are super hard to control. I'm getting my money back screw this s**t.
3795	0	a	The game has good potential. Game sim is very good but it bores me after a while the campain is just a boring race after another nothing challenging. Gran Turismo was good because you had do more than raceing and here it is everything the same i think.
3796	0	a	I'm sure this game is nice with a steering wheel or in VR, but it need standard configuration for keyboard and mouse. It's bad to be bound to change all controls to play(ex:change driving controls from arrows to wasd) and the sensiblity of all the elements of the cars are annoying to adjust because you cant ajust them from ''a pause menu'' like most of racing games, and they should be already setted in a wise way. And you can't turn the camera around the car with your mouse.I'm not hating this game, but it need a severals updates about configuration, the rest is all good although.In all, if you dont have a steering wheel or VR, and you play on keyboard and mouse, dont buy this game, you will be disapointed. If you want to buy this game be sure to have VR or a steering wheel.
3797	0	a	Disapointed, I played a demo of this and loved it but this game is just too hard. Cars handle weird, slip out on corners, hard to get the power down without a big spill. If you have the patience go for it but this is one game Im deleting local content for something else more fun.
3798	0	a	I have come back to this game after a while out and i am not impressed with the way things have been handled with the game and the forum.  once you could chat with the devs, even the man in change, Ian Bell on the forum, but that was some time ago when PC was released. back then the game had a few issues, mostly the race and setup being locked out.  but on my return i have disocvered a large amount of issues, a big one on the whole lot is half the host rooms being unconnectable and the other half are connectable. sometimes some would be connectable then suddenly stop being connectable then i get kicked out of the room. i have tried to report on this but absoultely no one is interested in the thread i left there.  i have decided to try give it the benefit of the doubt, 2 weeks worth of time and right now this issue being the biggest of the lot is completely ruining my game play experience online.  other issues i have noted are not as big but if no one can take the time to get back to me within the PC forum, i can't see a reason to report on others that go unnoticed. it's a shame though, if this happened over half a year ago, i would of gotten some help..  do i recommend this game? no, it has become increasingly frustrating to the point i no longer wish to play it any more. i hold some hope for PC2 when the developers get around to annoncement and release, but i no longer care for PC any more.
3799	0	a	Game breaking bugs all over the place, the devs don't care. They sell us DLC but the game is not even playable for me to enjoy. Keep your money far from this game. All those gimmicks are nice, but I can't even change my settings during a race. Wtf.
3800	0	a	I wont go into too much detail here, just a few points: +Looks really good (like OMFG!!) +Decent performance, even with an aging setup of 3xGTX470 SLi, 32gb Ram and i7 3820 +Great Simulation +Great on an XBOX compatible controller -No music/soundtrack for during the races, a shame as racing games tend to showcase some of the best out there -So few cars in the base game that already costs a lot, feels like a DLC cash grab -They had announce its succesor just a month or 2 after this game came out (more cash grab feels) -Still see broken penalties system (like people cutting corners through the dirt with no penalty) -Crummy AI, or maybe its part of the realistic scenario that only potatos can afford these cars -Definitely not mouse + kb friendly at all (a proper arcade mode would have been appreciated here) -No proper Stop/Start, kinda inexcusable that this cosmetic feature is still not implemented -Sound part of the simulation feels average, for instance, tyre squeel from breaking seems to just cut in and out instead of fade  Verdict: I like this game, its fun, its well designed, but the price tag is rather high for the content you receive, especially you'll be constantly wanting to buy DLC for all the really cool cars. I feel this game is the Battlefield of car games, and as such, it deserves a downvote.
3801	0	a	Do not buy this game unless you are hooking a wheel up, and even with a wheel, the controls are twitchy and unrealistic. I have a love/hate relationship, the game itself looks amazing, but the CORE gameplay, the controls and AI absolutely 100% needs revamping from the ground up. The AI will ram you off the track regardless, they will not go around you, just try to go straight through you, they brake early which often means they exit quick, if your like me and your a late braker, but slower exits, enjoy the carnage that follows your rear end.
3802	0	a	This game could of been great, but to me it is far from worth the money. You are DLC'd for extra cars, then as I ahve a AMD card, my fps is great game looks amazing, in the middle of racing random stuttering. I would highly reccomend not touching this game unless it is on major sale as you will need to buy DLC for the complete game.
3803	0	a	If you have a amd card/crossfire setup and use a force feedback wheel. You'll be just like the studio who made it. 'Slightly mad' and most likely extremely disappointed..
3804	0	a	Dont buy this game for racing it will let you down hard
3805	0	a	Why is this $15 for Xbox one ?
3806	0	a	The game looks great, good potential, but that's it. Unfortunatelly the driving is quite frustrating as there is a stupid steering dead zone that makes impossible any fine driving.
3807	0	a	I NEED HELP. I can find no way to get help from STEAM. THere is NO PLACE to simply contact you people.  Your crap program will not run project cars from my new TIKI computer using Oculus Rift. It used to run just fine on a different machine but irt will not run the RIFt on the new computer.   HOW THE HELL DO I CONTACT YOUR USELESS SUPPORT PEOPLE????  As a REVIEW --- I am looking for any and every way to getr STEAM off my computers and NEVER NEVER USE IT AGAIN FOR ANYTHING. There has to be a way to escape you and if so, I will find it.
3808	0	a	Eh, it's a fun game no doubt. Kind of wished they included a way to modify your own car to make more of your own instead of just picking what car you want to drive and thats that. I mean you can tune the tire pressure and mess with the brakes and etc but it would be a nice feature. Another thing that was rathe frustrating was the sound bugs. If you played the game you might know what Im talking about but its pretty annoying.   I would pick up the game if you have a controller or a wheel. Using a keyboard will not be fun whatsoever (I kept spinning out at the slightest turn of the wheel.)  I might buy the game again in the future now that I have a controller but for now I would watch some youtube videos before you get the game haha I made the mistake of using a keyboard and it ruined my experience  (I also put no for recommendation but I do recommend since its probably one of the best racing games for pc)
3809	0	a	I rarely write reviews, but I felt obligated to for this.  It's not very good. The graphics are great, but it plays like a game straight from an arcade. Isn't it supposed to be super realistic?!  Meh, 4/10, do not buy
3810	0	a	This game has great graphics and the simulation aspect of it is extremely well done. The cars feel realistic and are very fun to drive.   That said, there really isn't much to do in this game. I thought the whole 'sandbox' racing idea sounded fun, but by 'sandbox' I envisioned having lots of cars to choose from, from many different eras, and the ability to tamper and upgrade them etc, without having to grind and earn money to do it. You know, like jacking up a 1975 280zx to 800 HP or something...  The money aspect and grinding is removed, which is nice, but there's nothing really in its place, and so the game just feels kind of hollow. You get a handful of cars, that you can't upgrade or mess with them other than 'tuning' which in itself isn't that complex or fun (i.e. inflating tires to different PSIs, brake adjustments etc). And, having no money, the 'career' mode is just racing through tedious championships with ONE car that can't be modified, just to move to other leagues and other cars. (hours mastering a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Clio??? why???). But since you have access to all the cars from the start, there's no real incentive and it feels pointless. You're free to move the difficulty setting around, and from league to league, and all the various settings, but why even bother...The only thing somewhat fun in this game is the online racing against other people. But again, it feels very limited because there are just so few cars, and the only way to have a fair race is if they are all the same.   I suppose the trade-off is that the cars that ARE there, are very realistic and true to life. I imagine it took a long time to program that level of realism, and it's impressive. But, if you are just a casual gamer and car fan like me ... then who cares?...I'd rather have hundreds of slightly less realistc cars to choose from, because personally I would never know the difference anyway. I haven't driven but the few ♥♥♥♥♥♥ station-wagons and sedans I've owned in my life, so I have no idea of what a Huayra-whatever is SUPPOSED to look and feel like. If this game had MODS allowed, well, then that would be a different story...but apparently that's not happening either.   The moral is to do your homework before dropping 50$ on a game. I think by 'sandbox' they are misleading people...all that means is no unlockable content and no REAL career mode. It's a nice idea, but it takes away the 'game' aspect of it, and just makes it something to ♥♥♥♥ around with for a few hours when you're bored. ..BUT if you are hardcore about realism and all that, and you love to drive for the sake of driving, this might be your game.
3811	0	a	Project Cars is by far the most buggy racing game I've seen.   The game is taxing on even the most updated rig. My rig: ASUS Crosshair-V Formula-Z, 9590FX, R9-290X, 16G RAM, 250GB Samsung 840 Evo SSD. Inadequate. And after reading the posts about AMD GPU performance, I bought an Nvidia GTX 980. While the performance was better, it was far short of what I expected running FPS anywhere from 50 to 110 FPS with Ultra settings.  The menus are terrible and don't flow logically. In order to change your car livery, you have to drill down several levels of menus. No custom liveries.  Entering your friends online race room is prohibited if the race has started. So you have to wait for your friend to finish before joining.  Lots of game crashes. It makes getting friends together for racing difficult and arduous when one friend and another crash at random times.  There’s no retiring but you can look at a grayed out “retire button. This is especially bad if you've lost a tire and can't get to the pit. You not only have to wait till the end of the race but you and your friends have to wait for the race timer to expire because you cant make it to the finish line; I believe it's two minutes. Speaking of which, there's no way to customize the long wait timer.  The list of things wrong with this game goes on and on. A single patch wouldn't fix something that needs an entire rewrite. Sorry SMS, this is a fail.  *edit* After patch 1 came out I thought things would get better but they didn't:  If you want to use no HUD, be carful because your LCD will say your in a different gear at the start of the race than what the HUD says. Many times the LCD on the car would say I was in 1st and I was actually in neutral.  Some cars now will not let you change to neutral if your car's moving but others will. That makes no sense, because every other game will let you change to neutral- if you downshift too far its an added element of realism. This was not the case before the patch, so in my opinion this patch broke something.  One thing I thought would get fixed but didn't: If you have Steam overlay enabled while an online race is loading, you'll lose all input systems- no keyboard, mouse, or controller (G-25 here). so you have to ctrl-alt-del and kill the game from Task Manager. I've verified this bug doesn't just effect me, it effects my friends as well.  Another problem is that tracks disapear in multiplayer. A friend and I have noticed that Mazda Raceway and Oulton park simply are not in the online list one day and the next they are. This has happened several times.
3812	0	a	It's a good 'game' but I think Assetto Corsa or iRacing is better for your money if you're looking for a good sim.
3813	0	a	Not recommend if you are using gamepad/keyboard to play. Not sure about steering wheel. Didnt have one.
3814	0	a	Really disappointed. I have a 3,000$ PC yet the graphics are ♥♥♥♥. Controls are clunky. VERY little car choice. 2/10
3815	0	a	Usual boring driving.  Over sensitive controls, twitchy movement, inhuman AI abilities. Exactly what I've come to expect from driving games.  Dont belive the claims of DK2 ready, its rubbish and shouldnt be advertised the way it has been, actual races yes have a somewhat sluggish dk2 support but menus certainly do not.  If your buying this for VR like I did, dont bother its bearly usable without all the usual eye bending work around crap!  Being an non driving game enthuisiast I felt it was time to give this one a go, I have Assetto Corsa and that is the same deal as this game essentially but with less realisim in Porject Cars.   I wish I hadnt listened to Mack now to be honest, I'm 0 for 2 both recommended games from his you-tube channel. Great comedy not so great recommendations.  The steering wheel deadzone area is screwed, using my wheel I can bearly control any car properly and consistantly, the FFB is some of the most unrealistic I've ever felt.  £40 that I could have spent on something I would have enjoyed. Time for me to never get another car game again.   So in short if your like me and can take or leave car games dont waste your money.   If you like car games why not add yet another snooze fest to your collection.
3816	0	a	♥♥♥♥. thats all that needs saying really
3817	0	a	Paid $50 for this today. Overpriced to say the least. Essentially unplayable.   My Setup:  - SLI GTX 780 + Intel i7  - All generic no overclock   List of bugs:  1. glitches if you go too fast while scraping walls 2. if you crash too hard into wall you flip over or through side walls. Once on other side you can drive back through, however pretty major glitch. 3. the chat interface will censor random words like 'what' 'i' 'type' into **** * ****. 4. the chat box in game is positioned off to the side and doesn't wordwrap so it cuts off more than five words typed.   Pros:  Not much currently. Suppose... - I liked the music n promo videos. - The gameplay set up is better and more open feeling than other racing games like Grid AS. - Though the chat box has glitches(see below) I liked that it had a chat box vs only allowing mics like Grid AS.   Cons:  - UI is difficult to navigate, example:   &gt; the home screen has huge single button links for no reason.  &gt; the scrollbars don't work like standard scrollbars, they do some weird auto scroll glitchy movement. - Right away the audio for engine sounds is generic and has no variation, every gear sounds the same through the entire range of rpm.  - Graphics even at Ultra and High, etc (as high as I could put them) were as plain as any free game you could download. Grass was non existant, no shading or shadows, cars look plastic. The game literally looks nothing like the promo videos or screenshots. - Physics are broken, glitchy, unfinished, not working. It looks like they're on the right track for a more realistic type feeling, however currently they're just broke. - $50 is way too much for this game in this state. Should be $5 or free, especially after however many years they've been working on it for it to still be this unfinished. - Cars don't generate damage, instead pieces just fly off randomly, glass doesn't seem to break for example.   Summary:  Seems like this game should've been way more finished by now or priced way cheaper than premium pricing. However I do like some of the general characteristics of the game. Wouldn't recommend if you're used to getting some level of quality for $50.
3818	0	a	Very dissapointed in this game, the handling is very very bad compare to other car simlation game i played before.
3819	0	a	Long story short. If choosing between iRacing, Assetto Corsa and this: go with iRacing.   Graphics are fake and all the lens flare and god rays etc etc are trying to take away from some bad/jaggy AA. Not to mention the HORRIBLE AI.
3820	0	a	This is by far the worst drivers expirience i had in a game.... in a corner (lots of tries) i am the only car that get the effects of a collision even if we are about 6 cars that time in the collision!!!! where the f.. is the reality in this???? Seriusly who did this game without any kind of proper realism??? someone told me this is a great game and i run to buy it and then this !!! no reality what so ever ...only to grab the money out of your pocket
3821	0	a	Crashes everytime I play and is a known problem. as soon as you touch grass you've lost the race. called a simulator but you can slam the brakes/accelerate while turning 100% without spinning out. Progression is not rewarding, no cash and you can still advance through your calendar (?) just by racing. no background music while racing. you can choose your starting car type (gokart, f1 or whatever) in career but have to make your way through the tiers, rather than saving up money and buying an R8 with your terrible car/gokart winnings, like other racers. I heard about this game like 2 years ago and im so disappointed, gran turismo 3 (a ps2 game) is better than this.  I waste my money buying stupid things and this tops it.   
3822	0	a	Terrible, Terrible game. For the price you pay, you'd expect the cars not to handle like they would in some £5 arcade game. The graphics are good, but in terms of racing quality and sim, I'd go for the F1 games ten times over before buying this game. I completely and utterly regret my decision to waste my money on this.
3823	0	a	Horrrible broken game, would not reccomend. Wish I could get my money back.
3824	0	a	Unfinished/buggy as hell apart from that awesome when you can play the game.   I would recommend this game but not in this state  
3825	0	a	Really not the 'SIM' people say. They must be used to forza or something because this handling is pretty bad. I would save your money and wait for a sale and try Stock Car Extreme, Assetto Corsa, Iracing, Rfactor and Rfactor 2 before I would suggest this great looking console port. I mean some of the daily challenges online have gamepad users holding the fastest times... WHAT? That's a bad sign and in a real solid simulation that just wouldn't be possible.  5/10 PC sim score  9/10 console game score
3826	0	a	ok.. This is what i wrote on one of my forums for others to decide. i have given it a not reccomended mark here, because of the price.. AND if you read my review you will see why, although at £25 or less i would reccomed it with a warning.  So my oppinion...  pcars is a game that is more like forza than asetto corsa. Not always a bad thing though.  I would not go ahead and call it a sim i dont think, but im not sure if i would call it an arcade game either.  if this was 6 years ago with this sort of handling then i would call it a sim.  the physics dont seem quite right for a car and a bit more of a scripted thing vs actually calculating grip. Although this does seem to work relatively well for the cars and tracks i have used.  the FFB settings will have to be tweaked with as out of the box they dont really give much feel, Although that is true for every racing game on the pc with ffb support. Thats why you have the sliders..  Only tried a couple of cars and a go kart so far, but i am not convinced it is calculating grip from simulated physics vs scripting something like ( if power &gt;75 in % corner then..)  performance seems pretty good. my system is not state of the art, i have a HD 7870 8GB of ram and my i5 2500k right now is at stock clocks. and with most things on medium/high 1080p i average about 75fps (i would imagine) i get over 80 but less than 90 for pretty much all of it and some lower dips that never go below 60fps.  Also it does not seem to have mugello as a track.. 'this is an abomination'  so i would say..  I think ac is a better simulator  I think pcars is more polished  I dont think PCars is actually simulating via physics calculations, but scripting the physics is being done pretty well.  PCars does look nice, although when you are hammering down imola with zondas all around you i dont think you can see the diffference between it and AC, it also seems relatively well optimized for pc. although i do think there will be some tweaks along the way.  I would say the game is on par with forza/gt. but not comparable with AC if you are comparing just the driving aspects.  if you take in to consideration the single player career mode.. PCars is probably better than AC, and not as good as forza 'obviously depends on your own personal preferences'  SO I guess I would recommend the game, 'even without mugello in the track selection' but i will play AC the most. and probably would add some caution to my recommendation, some thing like: 'I recommend it. but its not a serious racer. its just a fun MP game'  So for the ~£25 i paid think it is worth it.  i would carry on with more thoughts and opinions but this is not a review lol.. I cant review a game i have only played for a while.  EDIT.. Played a bit more and did some mp. I liked the method of inviting friends who are in pcars As it easier than the asetto corsa method 'which has a lot to do to fix it) but the more you drive the less of a sim it is. And it really is forza.. if this game had been released before asetto corsa im sure i would have been happy with it. AC has just set the bar so high now that PCars simply could not reach it.  The graphics as mentioned really arent that noticable when you are concentrating. the FFB really gives you no warning of impending traction loss.. the cars dont seem to handle at all how they should do.. They do handle differently to each other, but that does not mean that they handle like the car they portray. Some give way to easy at the rear. some just seem to grip and grip.. And combined with the limited feed back from the wheel this just makes for a confusing racing expirience.. If you put the aids on and drive like you would drive you will smash your opponents. so that is just a no go. If you have all the aids turned off then you just cant feel when you lose traction. and this is something assetto corsa does very well.  Really its just a fun game for casuall racers. if you are a serious racing sim fan this is not for you.  I also forgot to mention before the edit.. i would not pay more than £25 for it.. and if i was giving it a score.. it would be 67%-73% (depending on my mood) Playable, fun with friends, Not a serious racer. On par with forza or Grand turismo. Not even in the same league as AC or Iracing.. Career mode is not really anything good at all its just tacked on, But the same is true for assetto corsa.  I would say that this PC Gamer reviewer is possibly paid to give such a high score. and claim it is a sim.  I do think asetto corsa is a much better simulation of driving. so if you want a sim just get that. PCars is ok for casuall racing. but i dont think it will be fondly remembered by the racing simulation croud. casual and console gamers... I think this will be a hit. but its not better than forza or Grand turismo.. All it really is is a forza/GT game that is available on pc. so i dont see why console owners would buy it either. And if you mostly play single player on your console. just buy one of the other 2 depending on your console.  For those who claim its a great sim. please stop the hype now.. the cat is out of the bag, and the game just is not what it was built up to be.
3827	0	a	Junk, G25 doesn't work correctly, graphics are glitchy and handling is poor. I want a refund
3828	0	a	Junk, G25 doesn't work correctly, graphics are glitchy and handling is poor. I want a refund
3829	0	a	I dont recommend this game...yet! This game have a potential and its like 80% finished.  Pros Great graphic Car physics OPTIONS! so many tracks!  Cons Menu... There is no cars classification Not enough cars...theres many race cars but not enough cars you really want to drive! No ferrari, no nissan, no VW, No stock bmw m3, m5 etc.  force feedback on my g27 is just awful... There is some options which are coming soon so this game shoould be in beta not finished yet.  EDIT: review of Project Cars/17.8.2016  Since it was released Project Cars have improved it self very much also new VR system gives you better feel just like you would drive car of your dreams  I have swapped my G27 for G29 since my original review and I must say its not wheel it self but Devs improved force feedback and general feel of a car when using racing wheel  Game optimalization have been noticeably improved but also graphics and detail of cars and world it self have been improved too  Project cars look, feel and smell(if you are petrolhead) like a real racing game that can compete with game like Forza, NFS or Gran Turismo.  Theres still some improvements to be made and a lot more cars and tracks to add but...  This game is still ♥♥♥♥!!!!!! WHERE THE ♥♥♥♥ IS NISSAN GTR?????!!!!!  WITHOUT NISSAN THIS GAME IS ♥♥♥♥, Dont waste you time and money! -9/11
3830	0	a	Doesn't work iand its buggy. I own over 750+ games and this is the first one I've ever requested a refund on. Says something. I'd like to be able to comment on the driving physics since people seem to say they are pretty good but can't play it enough to say consistently. The graphics are nice when not glitched out however, the sound is pretty good although pretty much the same for various vehicles (which it shouldn't be) and there is a decent selection of tracks and cars. Can't recommend however due to its poor optimization.
3831	0	a	Full of promise but ultimately it falls short.  AMD users should be the first people to stay clear from this game. Even with the latest 15.5 Beta drivers, Nvidia much weaker Nvidia cards still laugh in the face of an R9 290X.  On top of that, despite all the delays, there are still massive, massive rudimentary AI bugs and gaping holes in optimisation. When the studio head, Ian Bell, comes out and starts blaming the performance of the games engine on 'not up to scratch' quadcore i5 processors, then you know you might as well talk to a brick wall for more sense and less patronisation.   It then makes your head spin when the game is still in the state it is and SMS immediately starts talking about a Project CARS 2!! Well, good luck with that one... but I certainly won't be buying it.  Everything included and then the whole Wii U on-ice thing (after previously bragging about how well Wii U version is shaping up) then Slightly Mad Studios isn't a trustworthy studio whom I would choose to support with a financial vote of confidence.
3832	0	a	I don't really enjoy it, going to get a refund ^^;  Pros: + I like the helmet view + feel of the cars  Cons:  - Most the tracks are same realworld(read lazy) ones ive played to death in other games very unoriginal and boring - Graphics are just ok even on max, I was expect much more, Forza 5/Horizon 2 and Drive Club both look better overall - Glitchs, like it wouldn't even count me as racing for 3 of the races i tried in the hour and a half I played - lacks customization, no one likes look of logo filled cars it's ugly
3833	0	a	ATTENTION: Game is more immersive and playable with a steering wheel.  Pros: - Pretty visuals. - Good optimal performance. - Good sound effects. - Suprising amount of immersion. (found myself laughing at your 'fans' tweeting about your progress) - Suprisingly amazing physics. - Good model detail. - Love how almost every single car handles differently.  Cons: - Fair amount of bugs to still be worked out. - Lens flares and other lighting effects could use some work. - VERY Difficult to play with a controller and even more so to play with Keyboard+Mouse. - You most likely WILL need a steering wheel. - If you play with a controller/gamepad, you will have to optimize it. (Please don't even try it, most confusing menu I've ever seen) - Your 'fans' tend reptitivly to say the same things, ergo losing some immersion value. - Some menus are confusing, step-by-step tutorials would be nice for new players. - Multi-player is riddled with bugs. (Invisible cars? WTF??) - I found it hard to race through rain/storms/fog. (Hard to see, sliding into every corner barrier, hard to keep up with mild difficulty NPc's) - Pretty disappointed that you cannot customize vehicles. - Really weird approch to this title. (Is it simulation or arcade? it feels like both...? wtf? It has a very strange/confusing vibe)  VERDICT: Despite all the negatives, this title still have a fair amount of fun. It's not exactly what I expected due from all the hype, but it certainly isn't terrible. However, you will be annoyed by bugs, some weather effects, and the weird controls setup for gamepads/Keyboard+Mouse.  Should you buy it?: I'd say to wait until it either goes on sale or the developers get a chance to patch it up; which ever comes first. But as the game stands right now, it's not worth the $49.99 price tag.
3834	0	a	i was really excited for this game until i played it. I think it still has a lot of bugs and they should have just waited to release it. To me it still feels like its in beta.
3835	0	a	Unbelievable.  One of the poorest vehicle selections I've seen from a racing game in many years. I bought this game expecting something to improve upon FM5 and GT6, both in terms of control and experience. It's just awful. The engine noises are recycled from NFS: Unleashed 2 and the soundtrack appears to be as well, at least in terms of genre (but that's nitpicking).  What isn't nitpicking is having 2 manufacturers from the US and Japan combined, while having many from the UK; Ridiculous. The controls are frequently praised but it has no option for clutch and it feels like NFS unless all the assists are off, and even then it's just needlessly difficult without being rewarding. Lot's of tracks though which is nice. However, the visuals are either on par on below FM5, especially in terms of interiors (again, which seemed to be ripped from NFS UNleashed).   Overall, don't buy this game unless you're some sort of PC-exclusive ♥♥♥ who hasn't played FM5 or GT6 and clinging to your only option for sim racing this gen. It's highly overrated and I really regret dropping 50 dolars on this without doing my research first.   Don't make the same mistake I did. If you're in the mood for a decent PC racing game I would actually recommend NFS Unleashed 2 on PC, the car selection is superior in terms of breadth, just turn off the loud ♥♥♥♥♥♥ who talks to you.   GO GO GO! YOU'VE GOT THIS!  ♥♥♥♥ me. And while you're at it turn off the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ who talks to you in the game too.
3836	0	a	This not a sim at all. You either have grip or have none. FFB is pretty god awful. Basically every car feels like you're driving a mid engined car with a 2 foot wheelbase and infinitely stiff suspension. That's the way it feels from the wheel.  FFB options are convoluted and nothing at all like ANY other sim I've played.  The devs are totally unprofessional ♥♥♥♥♥ and this game is truly a terrible racing sim.
3837	0	a	Was looking for something similar to Forza Motorsport for PC. Unfortunately was disappointed with the handling model and sounds. Graphics were good and I liked the way the game was setup, but overall underwhelming.
3838	0	a	Not worth downloading even for free, doesn't launch at all.  EDIT:  Got it to launch, driving mechanics are incredible when the game works but it is too unstable and buggy to recommend at this point.
3839	0	a	Complete Garbage nothing like what they promised do not buy! Wait for Forza 6 or new Grand Turismo
3840	0	a	I pre-ordered this game, and the first 4 hours of gameplay were good. Shortly after that. I ran into bug after bug. Bugs that literally completely delete your etire career progress without any warning and you have to start the gamplay from scratch all over again. Cars go through mandatory pit stops, and come out with FLAT tires!! I am not making this up guys... Over 70+ hours in this game. I regret ever purchasing this overhyped epic FAIL. Online gameplay is terrible. The paddle shifter in some cars just rotates like its broken during gameplay. Huge mess, these guys don't know how to write working code, or fix any bugs. Every patch they release makes the game much worse NOT better. Don't buy this junk. Get something better. Trying to replay a saved replay video of a race causes the game to crash every single time. Lightly Mad Studios should never attaempt to make another game. Truly pathetic fail. Epic though.
3841	0	a	This game runs like **** on AMD cards. Waiting for fix but might never get it. Lesson learned, never expect to play new games with AMD GPU.
3842	0	a	I love both the GT series and the Forza series If you love either of the above, I think you will dislike this.  Especially from Forza, the customisations (and sometimes stupid) of engines / turbos etc is gone and this game I find is too hardcore for me and I find it not to be fun, it feels like a real effort to always stay on the track 100% of the time. Controls (using an xbox one controller) were terrible and after some customisations from suggestions on reddit make it feel atleast playable (way too twitchy with stock setups imo)  I might leave it for a few months, but overall Its not for me, maybe I expected something different and it's no fault of the game / developers.
3843	0	a	simulation my left nut. the grip characteristics are entirely wrong and im not talking out of my ♥♥♥ seeing as i drive a 1990 300zx twin turbo on 22 psi 400 hp to the wheels and it handles like an animal with just coil overs and these 'GT' cars have less grip than my street car. massive waste of $50. also no customization whatsoever... not even paint scheme? seriously? to think i actually thought this game would be better than forza 4 which is by far the most accurate 'simulator' i have ever played seeing as i made a 300zx nearly identical to the one i actually own and it was pretty damn spot on. so save yourself the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and dont waste your money on this trash 'simulator'. so angry. end rant.
3844	0	a	Simply awful.
3845	0	a	pretty bad game/// i dont recommend to any one. graphix=bof driving=bof fun= not much cant customise cars... you dont get any thing for completing races. if you wanna drive and nothing else i guess youll like it. carrer part of game is really bad.
3846	0	a	This game is awful. I feel like the DLC content is garbage and the sounds for cars in the game arent correct. Worst purchase for a racing sim. Go get yourself Assetto Corsa or Stock Car Extreme. Much better sims.
3847	0	a	Low tier cars SO BAD!
3848	0	a	Not very happy with this game. I tried to set it up with my mouse, and the input is simply laggy.  I spent more time in the menus than actually playing it, because the controls are not comfortable at all, i don't feel like i driving. I don't get why is it so difficult to solve mouse control like it is in LFS.  
3849	0	a	What a rip off. ! Is there a chance for a refund ? Please make sure that you manage to test demo first somewhere otherwise you'll be very disappointed. Also make sure you at least own 980 GTX for low details and GTX Titan X for medium details. Impossible to play on full without SLI solution. Game/race mode is also bad. Waste of money.
3850	0	a	i can't even play this game i have a logitech steering wheel and the whole game just spaz out and keeps going up in the menu and when i try to drive the car it just has full gas the whole time without me touching the gas padel i tried everyttthing nothting worked
3851	0	a	- Cripples AMD cards - AI in most series are just unplayable - Tyre model issues - Missing basic functions for a Sim (Saving multiple setups, tripple screen support list goes on) - Lobby lack features  Only thing good about this game at the moment is that its look pretty. Until these fixes are fixesd don't buy this game.
3852	0	a	game sucks requested a refund
3853	0	a	Just tried this with my HTC Vive. Instant nausea. I been looking forward to a decent racing game but this won't cut it. Cabin view is wonder and crisp but the track view is unplayable. You can barely see into the distance, it's almost impossible to know where you going. Extremely disappointing! I have also tried LFS and it's way better in that regard but the graphics aren't nowhere near project cars. I am requesting a refund at this point.

3855	0	a	UNTIL THEY FIX THE HANDLING AND PHYSICS THIS GAME IS BASICALLY TAKING UP SPACE ON MY HDD
3856	0	a	I wish I would have torrented this game so I could have seen how incredibly dull the 'career mode' is. Basically just a bunch of single player missions with absolutely no goal.  It's pretty, sounds good, and the physics are meh.  Powersliding isn't possible; and when brought up in the forums the entire dev team and all their slaves and minions  jump on you for even mentioning that it's unrealistic.   This game has serious issues and anyone who says otherwise (according to SMS) should just go somewhere else.  PC2 will definitely be a torrent first game.
3857	0	a	Assetto Corsa is much much better.
3858	0	a	it takes long time to start it up
3859	0	a	Will stick to NFS and Dirt sadly.  EDIT: First game Ive ever requested a refund on...
3860	0	a	The game crashes so often its ridicoulous. ive barely been able to do a few laps. Hell even monitors going so sleep when im away for a bit (window mode) causes the game to fail.  Even need to restart the game to change graphic settings in 2016, Wow!  This has been out for how long?  Maybe you will have more luck than me but i need my graphic driver version and such for other games too, cant keep testing loads of different versions for a super buggy game where you cant touch your controls when the car is computer controlled coming out of the garrage, it will crash!
3861	0	a	NOW IT STARTS TO NOT LOAD... BUT WOW STILL WORKS DAY IN AND OUT... STEAM ARE SELLING STUFF THAT MESSES UP AND WON'T FIX... WHAT A RIP OFF... NO MORE BUY FROM STEAM
3862	0	a	Stunning game. Stunning graphics and stunning game play, but after spending about $70 on a game, then having to download another 8GB in data and then having to spend a crap load of money on extra DLS's, then getting 0 online games. Not worth it!
3863	0	a	I cant play it.The max fps that i saw was 25 and i putted all the settings in low.
3864	0	a	Boot up the game, try with few different cars. Not impressed. One may argue that you need to speed time to setup up the FFB before you can ' feel' the car. But IMO you should be able have a ball park idea how the phyics and FFB is like even with the default setting. For Project CARS, they 'all' feel the same. The FFB is LAZY. Honestly the default FFB feels like SHIFT with X2 center spring, it just feels heavy with lots of clipping. Control profile option is non-existence. You can remap any pre-set profile, but are only allow to remap one at any given time, which means you cannot have more then one custom profile. Guys who have multiple input devices (e.g. more then one shifter) and try to setup different control profiles for different type of cars will be outta luck. Clearly designed for console and didn't even bother to add this option for PC users. A glorified Gran Turismo and Forza, nothing more.
3865	0	a	Just got the game during the fall sale and it's freaking crashing. I can't even finish 1 race. This game is like over a year old, it should not be crashing.

3869	0	a	CARS = Community Assisted Racing Simulator = lie. Slightly Mad Studios says: 'Project CARS is not a GameWorks product. We have a good working relationship with nVidia, as we do with AMD, but we have our own render technology which covers everything we need.'  Liars. So they put GW code and nVidia banners in the game for free ?  'NVidia are not “sponsors of the project. The company has not received, and would not expect, financial assistance from third party hardware companies.'  Again, Liars. So they put nVidia banners in the game for free ?  'The MADNESS engine runs PhysX at only 50Hz and not at 600Hz as mentioned in several articles The MADNESS engine uses PhysX for collision detection and dynamic objects, which is a small part of the overall physics systems The MADNESS engine does not use PhysX for the SETA tyre model or for the chassis constraint solver (our two most expensive physics sub-systems) The MADNESS engine does not use PhysX for the AI systems or for raycasting, we use a bespoke optimised solution for those The physics systems run completely independently of the rendering and main game threads and utilises 2 cores at 600Hz The physics threading does not interact with the rendering, it is a push system sending updated positional information to the render bridge at 600Hz Any performance difference with PhysX would not be reflected with differences in comparing rendering frame rates. There is no interaction between PhysX and the rendering Overall, PhysX uses less than 10% of all physics thread CPU on PC. It is a very small part of the physics system so would not make a visual difference if run on the CPU or GPU'  This junk word says that this game still don't work properly on AMD hardware after plenty of time. I wish you all the best with pCars2 and I'm curious how will it goes sale
3870	0	a	I was banned from posting in the forums for calling Ian Bell a p r i c k. Meanwhile he is free to call the players every name under the sun. Dirty dev.  Oh and the game is rubbish, I put pleanty of hours in to it, go for assetto corsa instead.
3871	0	a	Good game ruined by overpriced DLC
3872	0	a	This game constantly drops my USB devices. The VR compatibility is garbage. The physics are flat and boring and do not even come close to the competition. Get Assetto Corsa or Dirt Rally if you want to have fun.
3873	0	a	Empty in south america. Refunded.
3874	0	a	I was really looking for a game similar to GT6/Forza 6 but alas, this game is nowhere close. The amount of cars is only about 75 compared to forza's ~500 and Gran Tourismo's 1000. That was something I liked about Gran Tourismo, you could race everyday cars as well as super cars. This game is lacking some major cars brands that I think should be a staple of any racing title such as Ferrari and Lamborghini, but aslo brands like Dodge, Chevy, and Nissan. From a control and physics standpoint, the game feels sort of clunky and like everything is over exaggerated. What would be a mild loss of control in other games turns into a full on 720 degree spin-out in this game. Using a keyboard is useless for this game and a gamepad is not the best. I havent tried using a wheel/pedal setup as I don't have that but a game that can only be played using that equipment really limits the customer base. The graphics are nothing to write home about, but they are fairly good. Thankfully I haven't experianced many of the game breaking bugs other users have reported but this game still isn't what I was hoping for.  Overall, its not a terrible buy, but I would never pay full price for it. 2.5/5
3875	0	a	Keyboard and keyboard/mouse controls are horribly done. Not fun at all to play with. Who assigns turning to mouse movement?  I'll give this game another try when I've got a controller available, but the devs should really try out the keyboard controls for other car games. Several of the other games I've played have had much nicer keyboard experiences, like TrackMania or Need For Speed.
3876	0	a	Just a heads up, if you use a gamepad, this game is unplayable. I understand that in-depth adjustment of settings may resolve issues, however should you have to do this throughout the game on a constant case-by-case basis?
3877	0	a	The game was working, The screen resolution changed now I can not get to the options menu to make changes.
3878	0	a	I simply can't recommend it. It seems unfinished... if you like tweeking with your tunings, and your steering input (wheel or pad) for HOURS until you get to something useable, feel free to pay the money. I had the highest hopes for this, i thought, finally something Forza-like for the PC Gamer... but nope, not nearly Forza-like.   The mechanics: are unbelievably inconvenient. You have to (or at least i was to stupid to figure out otherwise) LEAVE the race to change your controls! The Menu itself is inconvenient too, it wants to be different and it is. And thats the problem: the navigation is utter rubbish!  The looks: its a good looking game really, it has some nice cars too. But that is all.  All in all: i am still trying to find a acceptable setup because i really want this game to NOT suck... but i guess that won't happen.  So my suggestion: watch some letsplays and see if it fits your likings... then, if you see what i mean - DONT PAY A CENT for this. I regretted it pretty fast.
3879	0	a	don't buy this piece of ♥♥♥♥ if you got no steering wheel this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t is unplayable with a controller even with doing some configuration paid 20$ like 7 months ago and still salty about it
3880	0	a	I will play this Game if they get Nissan Cars... especially the GTR... until then... nope
3881	0	a	Didn't work for me as I only have a Vive and so couldn't actually drive the car. Maybe better if you have a keyboard/mouse or steering wheel?
3882	0	a	I will play this Game if they get Nissan Cars... especially the GTR... until then... nope
3883	0	a	If you dont have a steering wheel for this game. Dont buy it, its screwed up!! Constantly oversteers and Steam would not refund me the money because I was an hour over their return policy. WASTE OF MONEY DO NOT BUY IF YOU ONLY HAVE A CONTROLLER.
3884	0	a	Great game! But no, in game MUSIC! Really! It's a simulation for crying out loud!  At least give people the option! I look for one.  You have this great intro music, then when you play the game, no music. that's a let down.  
3885	0	a	WHAT A MESSED UP GAME!!! I know I only played it for an hour but here is the thing if you like Racing sure go for it. If you hate racing well don't get this game I really wanted to try this and it was beautiful in VR too. The only thing is that I really am dissapointed with the Driving system with this game it is absolutely terrible it ruins the whole game and it's really hard to steer like that. I do not recommend this game even in VR it really is junk and only worth about 7.99 to me. Save your money and buy better Racing games out there or something else you enjoy.
3886	0	a	I only recommend this game if it's no more than $15. I won't go over the pros since you will see that on other reviews. What I will share is what I think of the AI.  The AI stinks. It doesn't play well. On some races, the AI will pit you. You lose control and spin out into the grass or sand. It's going to take you a while to get back on track.  Now, should you decide to pit the AI, don't bother. You can NOT do it. I was attempting to pit the AI numerous times. There are instances where just when you're about to ram the car, it somehow magically accelerates and moves out of your way and you spin into a wall and lose control. There are times when the AI hits the brakes to avoid you pitting them.  There have been times where I succeeded to knock the AI car out of the track. Guess what, it didn't lose control and remained driving flawlessly and did NOT slow down one bit despite driving over SAND!  You try driving over sand in a race car and it would take you forever to get back on tarmac. Not the AI cars!  This game is supposed to be a 'simulator'. Ha!
3887	0	a	Cant drift this game sucks.
3888	0	a	this game is buggy when racing it fast forwards sometimes someone please help me when i play by myself of track its fine but when i race with other cars sometimes it fast forwards itself and then stops can someone please help me
3889	0	a	VR sickness makes this impossible to play in VR
3890	0	a	Here's the thing: If you like Gran Turismo, get rFactor. If you like Forza Motorsport, get Project Cars. If you hate both rFactor and Project Cars, get Assetto Corsa because you don't deserve true simulators.  However, i can't recommend Project Cars over rFactor.   Most of the physics have been redone from scratch, but the gravity physics were took from Need For Speed Shift 2, and thanks to that, oversteering and countersteering is weird and twitchy.  Really the 3 main reasons you get Project Cars are these:  Sound (I'm not kidding, the cars here SCREAM) Career (Start from the bottom of kart racing all the way up to F1, or start right from F1 for monumental challenge) Online (Didn't survive the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ community disease but netcode and matchmaking is stupid quick and it's very easy to create rooms with friends)  Also this 'Project' started as a Wii U equivalent of Forza Motorsport and Gran Turismo, but then it got released in ALL consoles except Wii U. *clap* *clap* *clap*  If this game gets official mod support, with Workshop or another mod downloader, i will finally be able to recommend this game.
3891	0	a	Terrible, I cant even open the game. Do not waist youyr money on this game.
3892	0	a	This game feels great to drive, really challenging and responsive. I'm don't usually play car simulation games, but I felt like this would be a great buy. I like goals. Things I can achieve by getting better or progressing through the game. This has none of that, that's why I found myself wondering in the menu, what to even play? Shall I choose a random track and a random car while I admire the graphics and physics of the game. Or should I play against somehow really annoying AI. This game just wasn't for me and if you're someone who enjoys a game like Forza for its goals and kinda boring progression system, maybe this game isn't for you either.

3896	0	a	pad for to play online wish i didt bother
3897	0	a	As much as I personally dislike this game you might like it, but that depends on how good you are at driving with a keyboard or have a racing wheel, because I am extremely incompetent when driving in this game engine with a keyboard, and when I use my Xbox 360 controller everything slides all over the place, and is uncontrollable.  Other from the fact that it is uncontrollable, the game runs beautifully and looks AMAZING, and along with that there is a lot of cars (better than Forza in my opinion because of variation of cars) and a lot of DLC that unlocks a lot more cars, and there is a lot of maps and customizable weather, and time. If you like a 'career' in a racing game go forza or something because personally I dont think it is very good at all because of in forza it goes you are racing here and there are a few different classes of cars you can do this race with where this game goes select what kind of car do you want to drive for example there is go karts of formula 1 cars or stock cars or regular sports cars, but you select one type of car and you are locked to only go-karts, or stock cars, or formula 1 cars, or whatever you selected.   There is online that i have no opinion on because I have really bad internet so it would lag all over the place so I didn't bother. And one last thing if it matters to you it is that Project CARS is the first game i have ever refunded on steam just because of the controls put me off so much and I would have kept it and left a positive review if it controlled well because it is amazing otherwise
3898	0	a	Good:  Looks nice Runs fine on Ultra at 1440p (60-90fps here) Good car selection Some good tracks FFB is not the worst Engine sounds  Bad  Engine sounds on some cars (overdone) AI Cheaters on leaderboards already pCARS 2 announced already meaning this will die  Online multiplayer seems pretty dead for a newly released game    So you have 2 options if you want to avoid racing against the stupid AI. Either hotlap or find a racing community to race against.  Overall underwhelmed and the news of pCARS already on the horizon and with the crowdfunding for it starting very soon I feel cheated by the devs.
3899	0	a	This is not a fun game for me. There's a lot of issues with the actual game client itself that's not system related but game related. There's some options missing that are sorely needed and every change to the visual settings requires a restart of the game. There is no default settings option at least none that I could find which was a pain when I just wanted to get above 40FPS and set everything to high.  The driving is just so incredibly boring. It's stiff. Really stiff. Messing with the sensitivity just results in oversteering(You actually have to lower your sensitivity as the default is way too high at 50!). Using a controller the steering just isn't smooth at all. It's like it's emulating mouse key presses and locking them at degrees to where your controller stick is. A little bit to the right this game isn't a little bit to the right in most racing games but it's as if you're quickly tapping a key on your keyboard. It feels janky...  The multiplayer just sucks a fat one. I really can't explain how incredibly disappointed I am with it. All you have is Short or Long races. Long races can last a freakin' day but default to two hours! There's even practice rounds that are default to two hours! The MP browser is just terrible by any stretch of the imagination. You can't sort by ping, you can't sort by name, you can't sort by length, you can't sort by map unless you use the filters. The only way to find things is by using the filter options but there is NO sorting options at all. Even at that the filter options are extremely poor at best which makes finding the right lobby needlessly hard to do.  MP is basically drop in and drop out from what I could see. You don't start a race with everyone else. You just kind of load in... take off from the pitstop... and drive around... you just keep driving. It seems incredibly pointless especially when races can last over an hour at a time and no one sticks around for that long. It's like paying for a drive around Mondello Park; it's you just driving around a professional track seeing how fast you can go. There may be other people on the road but you aren't racing them, you're not even competing against them. You're just driving. It's just so sorely lackluster and so unfun.  I was expecting a good RACING game. I didn't get one. I had to refund this... Knew I definitely wouldn't get any enjoyment from this. Maybe you can but from what i've experienced, if you're in it for MP(Which I am), it's not worth the money even on sale for €20.
3900	0	a	Interface is complicated and non intutitive. Game is frustrating to play
3901	0	a	This game feels unfinished, unpolished and cheap. It feels like a free to play or budget game even though it has a AAA price tag. The graphics are not nearly as good as we had been led to believe, but even so, the game does not run very well even on decent systems and is very demanding considering how below average the graphics are.  Very little content, few cars, everything is unlocked from the beginning, single player career is bland and pointless, no feeling of progression or achievement. No Steam cloud support.  I feel that this game has been massively overhyped and I would go so far as to say misrepresented by the developers and its 'early access' supporters. Buyer beware
3902	0	a	♥♥♥♥--------------------ing hate it cu-----------nts scamming wan----rs
3903	0	a	Seriously should have been called Project Bugs. Many of the first problem have been solved but it creates tottally new ones. Don't expect to find good solution or explanation on forum.  I have many hours on it only becaus of my friends playing it, otherwise I would have been refound - Looses FFB in races for no reason -several connection lost in multiplayer - game freeses and crash to many times - totaly stupid presentation of the menus ( steering settings have no explanation and are spread trough more than 5 pages) - screen freeze in replays - Poor A.I. - Still no tires sound But when it works ( 1 on 3 times) its a good sim racing game Arm yourself with patience - Multiplayer is littered with stupid ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s that destroy cars of other player. I only playing it when my friends are online - Host don't have control of their rooms: no kick/ban option they put a stupid vote to kick option that nobody cares about so you get stuck with trolls and other anoying players -Your car sound great but other cars sonds like moskitos  Seriously, this game had been delayed for more than a year and came out incomplete. 2 patches later, the problems just moved in other places. I'm really desapointed  Graphics are great and good choice of cars and tracks. I only would recommend it if you can buy it in discount (50% off or better) and if you have a REALLY POWERFULL computer. If you are looking for a great game to play try Asseto Corsa or other games that are 100% finish product.
3904	0	a	For a more proffesional review visit  www.pretendracecars.net   I really wanted to love this game... I wanted it to be the best car simulator, the one to write history,  more awesome than shift 1 and 2... And since this was the same developers of the shift, I had high hopes... And found high hype instead.  So, the pros:  Variety of kinds races Pit stops Weather Graphics Sound*  Cons: Gameplay (not arcade nor sim, between) Broken AI of opponents on single player Unrealistic driving, either by joystic, or steering wheel Cheaters on online (already) Missing the agony and feeling of competition on single player (due to AI) Tires not as awesome as mentioned ( nfs shift 2 imagine ) And no ability to paint your car ??? (on this maybe I am wrong, but can't find how.) AI off road is acting same as on road. Fanboys try to shut you up if you say anything bad AI doesn't change tyres AMD has serious problems. After 1 month and game still have major issues and glitches Few car brands Track not laser Scanned You need a really great system to run it smooth and without stuttering No pit crew (although they said that it has pit crew) Lot off blind sectors that you can go off track and drive unpunished. Car can not crash totally (yes tyres can fly, engine blow but thats all, not a sim after all, huh? ) Wheel and joystick needs heavy adjustment before playing. Most of the WMD members have bad attitude Ian Bell (Head of Studio) Dictatorship  http://forum.projectcarsgame.com/showthread.php?29559-2016-Assetto-Corsa-coming-to-Xbox-One-and-PS4/page19  *Sound of tyres almost not exist.   Result: It is a broken arcade sim, nothing more and nothing less...   Buy it when it reach max 20 dolllars.... And if all future dlc are included in these 20 dollars...
3905	0	a	Huge Force Feedback issues.
3906	0	a	These guys should of delayed release a few more times and finished the ducking game!!!!
3907	0	a	I'm sure the game is great, but I bought it on the basis of it having Oculus Rift support. There is no support for VR headsets in the menus, so to get yourself into the driving seat you have to fire up the game on a monitor, remember all the keystrokes to get you from the main menu to the race, then restart the game through the head mounted display and try to playback those keystrokes.  If you're looking for something to try out with a VR headset you might want to hold onto your £39.99 for now.
3908	0	a	The visual are nothing spectacular and people have said it runs like crap on amd HW i have a 290x and i can confirm nvidia got the ♥♥♥♥ right in there on this one and i wish i could get a refund for it. #nvidiasucks
3909	0	a	Hi, I brought this game for 30 euro in sale and I sad, It will be the dreatest racing game that I played... I sayd it becoulse photos was amazing, gameplays was positible, AND THAT HYPE! but, after that I brough, It isn´t like on thge photos... It´s one big crap, it is ♥♥♥♥, so dont buy it wait for Forza Horizon 2, it is planed it go to PC :) And dont buy this, this is ♥♥♥♥ :)
3910	0	a	This game did not live up to my expectations and I'm going to have to caveat emptor this game until optimization improvements are made.  The Good  -Looks gorgeous  -Plenty of tracks -Tracks are laser scanned from the real counterparts -Handling is excellent  The Bad   -Very poor selection of cars(Needs more american muscle cars) - If this game had a better customisble cars it would be much better
3911	0	a	This is a waste of money. It has a very nice look but the gameplay does not back that up. I wasted $50 on this game but was lucky enough to get a refund from Steam. I would not recommend this game to anyone unless they like to drive cars that handle like they are on ice. This game is horrible
3912	0	a	pile ov crap plays terrible and looks no better than any other racer if not worse
3913	0	a	Nice graphics, needs fast machine for maximum details. Drivability is the problem, steering is console-like with steering in game lagging behind your steering input. Simply undrivable. Tried hard for 45 minutes and gave up. Ran back to live for speed.
3914	0	a	Pile of garbage overrealistic ♥♥♥♥. Wasted my money thinking it was grand turismo for pc but i got grand kart racer xDXDXDXDX.
3915	0	a	This game does not work on AMD hardware. On a r9 290 cant run the game at 60 FPS on medium setting @ 1080p (framedrops under 30fps even runing alone, shame on you SMS)

3918	0	a	For someone who knows nothing about cars, this game is very difficult. Talking about bars and pressure with no tutorial teaching you how to play. Yes the game looks pretty and nice, but playing it makes me frustrated becuase I don't have a clue on what I'm doing.
3919	0	a	Installed the game on Friday last week and since then; I can't just launch it! Uninstalled, re-installed a couple of times; checked via Steam the cache integrity and all these stuff. I just don't get why it doesn't want to launch... This is a shame really!
3920	0	a	Worst physics... far from realistic controlability. Lots of tunning options. None however overcome the other problems.
3921	0	a	What a crap game! Force-Feedback is a joke. Granted the graphics are good. That is the most positive thing I can say about this horrible game. Even on sale it was a fukkin waste of money. Tried to get a refund and the A-holes at Steam refused. True customer Support you have there guys.
3922	0	a	Do NOT bother with this game, especially if you are only trying it for the VR.  The audio is terrible, and the visuals are even worse
3923	0	a	DON'T BUY IT! A racing game without split-screen? what's the point?
3924	0	a	If you're after online races, look somewhere else. Pcars is a dead game. Handful of players can only be found on the weekends. 75 lobbies, zero players.
3925	0	a	What is Project Cars? Is it worth your money? Are there better competitors out there to invest your time and currency in?  A watered down version of Forza, maybe, and hell yes.   The main problem I have with this game is that for the last two hours I've spent maybe ten minutes playing, and 1:50mins messing with the settings just to try to A) make it look anywhere near what they advertise it looks like(GTX 970, FX-8350 OC'd, 16GB Ram, see what I'm saying?) B) run at all smootly. I mean what is the single most important part of a racing game? That you can ♥♥♥♥ing control your car while you race!   In a time where the animosity towards a game like the Witcher 3's performance lead me to upgrade and run it like silk I have to say it is a little unacceptable for the dev's to choose such an archaic graphics menu, and I'm assume coding for their game. These are sttuering issues I used to get with Dirt, and Need for Speed, ie other gar-♥♥♥♥♥ ports from the consoles to PC. And like those games, I am at a complete loss for how to fix them, or achieve a balanced state of performance and visual fidelity with the game, nor do I feel it is my obligation to spend so much time on configuring ♥♥♥♥ for a game, its not the late 90's anymore, and even on the PC, I atleast have an assumption these days there should be a certain level of drop in and just play the freaking game with no issues. Sure maybe you'll want to tweak the graphics afterwards, see how close to get to maxing it out without performance loss etc, but come on almost two hours? It is just annoying.   In short, the game runs like garbage, and from looking at the forums, its a general thing not a 'Nvidia specific' issue or anything. I have stuttering, and 'teleportation braking system' with controllers, keyboard and mouse or even my G27, so buyer beward in that category.   the game also falls short in its categories when compared to various competitors. Graphics? good(or barely playable for a lot of us), but not as 'high res' it seems, or smooth as Assesto Corsa( a game I should mention I've never have input or stuttering issues with), though it does have some cool effects like water etc. Car selection? Not bad at all, but no Forza or Gran Turismo, AI, realism etc(from what I can stand to experience for the point of this review), seems pretty legit, but again nothing compared to any of the top existing realism racers on the PC.   The last thing I will say in support of this title is that the presentation is the one area where it blows almost any other game(maybe not Forza) out of the water. Every menu option is narrated, appealing interface visuals, music is great, career mode for the game seems fun and like it has a lot of replayability/tons of game time to enjoy on its own.   Due to performance issues though I have to stick a huge WARNING on this game's recommendation, look into other options if you have that need for digital speed for now, or otherwise hope and pray the devs/community admits the poor state of this game on the PC and attempts to fix it...or when the sequel comes out :P
3926	0	a	All in all I like the game for just the occasional drive. But to be called 'most authentic and technically-advanced racing game on the planet' is lacks the ability to save multiple setups per track. Come on guys, it should not be to hard to put that in. You can do one 'wet' + 'dry'. A very bad and serious commission from the start. Note I backed the game from day 1 when 'historic Spa' was still in and the statement 'most authentic and technically-advanced racing game on the planet' was still something to be believed. All is put on PC2 now. Really disappointing and something to be remembered when considering PC2. So recommend Yes for the drive, No for the sim.
3927	0	a	If you liek to drive and thats it this game is great.  If you like to customize or tweek the exterior like colors sticker etc then this game sucks
3928	0	a	i dont really like this
3929	0	a	♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI nice graphics meh gameplay  Does graphics matter much? if not i dont recommend this
3930	0	a	Overrated graphics, primitive collision physics...
3931	0	a	After all this time, still no Steam Cloud Save? Have to use Game Save Manager to sync progress between 2 machines.
3932	0	a	i just dont like any of anything
3933	0	a	this game sucks it is impossible in the rain and the steering is so hard. i've messed with the settings and i've won alot of races but the more powerful cars you can t even keep them on the track. sorry but 60$ down the drain here!!
3934	0	a	Great performance on desktop but abyssmal performance on the Vive with all settings on low on a 1080. Do I have to say more?
3935	0	a	Pretty much, this is  Gran Turismo for PC.
3936	0	a	no wheel, no fun;  btw. project cars. a good name since this 'project' isnt finished yet. poorly optimized and as i mentioned, if you have to play this on a controller, no fun, no fun at all! also i dont know about graphics, good car model no question but the rest is just....well it a car game, trackdetails are meh and if you havent the power to play this in 4k its just another racing game with rain. dont get the fuss about it also because its engine is a joke (restarting if you alter a graphik option)   buy it if its on sale otherwise ignore the hyped product that cant live up to its hype....not even close
3937	0	a	School Project Cars  Project Cars is supposed to be a simulator, but it fails to achieve this. The game is definitely hard and people often confuse this with it being a simulator. There are so many aspects which make it unrealistic it can only ever be an arcade game in my eyes. Why it’s not a simulator:  Remove the driving aids and the higher power cars become un driveable even with steering wheel and peddles. It’s not easy to drive a Ariel atom but guys it’s not impossible either.   No pit crew.  Pit lane traffic light normally red, AI control drives you straight through it.  No penalties for crossing pit exit line.  No parade lap.  No checkered flag, (or any coloured flag for that matter as no marshalls.)   Unrealistic damage, smash head long into wall at 100mph and car just seers to one side.  AI driving is of the 1990’s era, AI cars often just drive in a parade around the whole race behind you. AI hardly ever tries to overtake you unless you’re on a straight.   At 100% difficulty some series you will be faster by 2 seconds a lap others you will be 20 seconds a lap behind.   Allows ridiculous corner cutting. For a start…  The graphics engine is lame, even on 980GTX you get micro stuttering in corners. The colours and lighting are also very unrealistic. It is a detailed game graphically but not in a realistic way. It’s also behind graphically with other games of this generation. If you compare it to Driveclub or Forza 6 although arcade games they do have a much more realistic look about them.   It can’t be that bad as I’ve played 66 hours, but I generally just load up play 30 mins and get bored. I don’t regret buying Pcars but I wouldn’t bother with project cars 2.  You only have to scroll through the reviews to this how appalling the development team are at addressing bugs, they seem to have contempt for anyone who has purchased the game. On the forums people are banned for raising bugs or for asking questions that reflect project cars in a bad light.  For the reason I’m giving it a thumbs down.  
3938	0	a	The game is very pretty, the driving is very good.  The problem is is that there is no content for this game, the multiplayer is horrible and dying, you never know what the AI is going to do, runs considerably worse on AMD cards, they expect you to buy DLC for things that were promised befor released. On top of all of that the next game is currently being worked on and a Kickstarter is out while this game is still a buggy mess with no content. If you want a racing sim go pick up Asseta Corsa
3939	0	a	I'm sorry to say that as beautiful as this game is, it sucks. Sorry. :(
3940	0	a	This game started out good. However this morning it will no longer support the mouse during play which makes the game uncontrollible. Very very unhappy as there is no way to get help.
3941	0	a	Don't like this game at all, even on sale for 20 euro i think it's to much.... PLEASE FORZA COME TO PC!
3942	0	a	Trash game dont even buy it
3943	0	a	Graphics didn't look good on HTC Vive.
3944	0	a	I got this cause I wanted to race with people, but it just isn't that fun. I mean once you're on the track and you are going it's alright, but to get to that point you have to deal with a lot of nonsense. It's about as interesting to drive as grand theft auto. It doesn't require much skill, but you can make it hard on yourself if you really wanted to. Anybody can pick up this game and win easily, which is pretty much the only reason to like it... but it's not very rewarding. Meaning, you just don't have much of a reason to play it. If you like casually racing it's cool, but if you really wanted a hard core racing game you'd look elsewhere.
3945	0	a	Does not work in vr with G29 do not buy there is no support for this game! WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME!
3946	0	a	How do change the screen size ? it show far to big on my 28i screen , on start up ???
3947	0	a	This game is unplayable on an Oculus Rift. Wish there was a way to return a game.
3948	0	a	Throthle sensitivity is a scam! 0% throttle sensitivity will still be 100% GGWP dont buy this scam
3949	0	a	Will not run great on AMD R9 290 even with overclocking. Cars do not have any 'feel' on a controller. I also prefer to race for money or credits to purchase new vehicles or upgrades. Sadly, all vehicles are unlocked from the get-go and no upgrades are available for purchase. I miss Forza 4.
3950	0	a	I really want to like this game but using a keyboard and mouse makes it practically unplayable. Firstly there is no option for panning with the mouse to look around so that threw me off at first. Secondly, the steering with wasd is unsensitive (I have tried adjusting it) and so often I found myself spinning out uncontrolled. Finally, with a keyboard, the throttle maxes out as soon as you press a key, so the track is more like an ice-rink most of the time. In short, I would not reccomend this game unless you have a steering wheel and pedals. Other than that, the graphics are great and the selection of tracks and cars is superb! Great design, but I feel as though is is optomised for console rather than for PC.
3951	0	a	well i have the minimum system req, and even on full low i can get max ~20 fps. LOL. (maybe because i have amd? ). I also tried with laptop which has gtx 650 card and i7 processor, but the same, maybe A LITTLE BIT better (30-35 fps on very low lel).  Also, unplayable with controller, and no proper force feedback for wheels (g27). No settings option during races, no tuning like in assetto corsa.
3952	0	a	This is one of the worst racing sims i've ever played. Not the worst but definitely down there.  Pros: -The tracks and the car look fantastic. The details and the asthetics are top notch. -The sound of the cars is brilliant. Other sims somewhat lack a decend liquid dinosaur burning soundtrack. PCars has nailed it with the sound of these cars.  -Pretty good selection of tracks available. -Has good steering wheel support. I.E easy remapping tools and defaul setups for many steering wheels. Even though you have to tweek the deadzones and senstivity quite alot. -Game Menus look pretty good.  Cons: The game has been out for over 1 year now and STILL suffers from instant game crashes, unplayable tracks, bugged car tuning and the worst mulitplayer in any car racing game.  -Car handling is all over the place. Some cars will stick to the road like glue, others are like driving on sheet ice. Regardless of track conditions. Any input from you, whether brake, throttle, or steer, you will end up spinning out of control and smashing into a wall. Even when you are going slowly, high gear and low revs to reduce tyre spin up. Doesn't make a difference. -Frequently insta-crashes when starting a single player race. I.E You select a car/track, click start, once past the loading screen and into the pits, game crashes. Only way out it to task manager end task. This also happens with multiplayer. -About 70% of the the time when you load into a multiplayer game, after clicking 'Drive', AI will take you of of the pits, revert control to you and suddenly you have no control over the car, it will slow down, hit a wall (because you cant steer) and the game will crash. -Some players get randomly kicked out of multiplayer games when they are just trying to join. -Pits system seems like it was forgot about until the last minute; confusing and buggy (say you want to change your tyres, nothing happens and you get sent out of the pits with the same worn tyres). -After setting up a multiplayer game, after the loading screen and being placed in the pits, on certain tracks your car will just fall through the floor. This has happened to me in single player too. Thought I was playing PCars not FSX. -Single player AI seems to based upon that 14 year old that only wants to ram every single car of the track. Sometimes they are good at 'shutting the door' on you and actual competitive racing. But only sometimes. More like, 30-40% of the time.    My average PCars day: Load game up. Fancy a bit of multiplayer. Find some active lobbies, most being compeletly empty, some with 3 people in, the odd one with 10+ in. Select a lobby, choose car, join session, game loads, into pits...game crash. End task, re-start game. Repeat above, get into the pits this time, AI drives out of pits, maunal control, nothing. Watch as a huge crash barrier gets closer and closer with no way of controlling my car, hit it, game crash.  Repeat above about 2 times more, actually get into game and start racing. no further issues. Unless you want to change your car which you can only do by completely exiting the session and re-joining, and having the same issues as listed above.  Needs alot of improvement. Wish I didnt buy the game, thought it would be alot better.   5/10
3953	0	a	♥♥♥♥ game .. hope for a forza ... no tuning ..... no modification .. no simulation ... want to get refound isnt a forza for pc dont buy ..buy asseto corsa ...
3954	0	a	For some reason, 20 VR games in and this is the only game to give me motion sickness.
3955	0	a	Piece of crap, constructive criticism - yes , because i described what they gave us, a piece of the biggest ♥♥♥♥ they made, the other pieces we have to buy over DLC ;)
3956	0	a	Nowhere close to the GRID series, tracks are just static settings, no barrier interaction, no tracks in sand, nothing.
3957	0	a	wanted gran turismo pc edition got sim racer with 'story mode' that is bad and not a story mode  come on people just make a game I can put a supercharger in a 60 year old mini cooper that's all I ask
3958	0	a	I really wanted to play this game for a long time, now i've got it, n waited even longer to download it (slow internet) aaaaannnd it didn't work. It kept on crashing everytime i started it.  I read multiple reviews and tried several ways to fix it, from updating the drivers, removing them and reinstalling them, switching to another gpu, fixing the voltage received by every single peice in my rag and many others... still didn't work!  What a shame, lost almost 50$ just like that, for nothing :/
3959	0	a	I HEARD THIS DEVELOPER WAS WORKING WITH REAL DRIVES AND WANTD TO MAKE A REAL GAME WITH REAL LIKE CAR CONTROL BUT NOW I REALIZE IT WAS ALL A LIE.   I OWN HONDA ACCORD AND I TAKE SWEEPING BENDS AT 140KM/H WHICH I AM UNABLE TO DO ON THIS GAME. THIS GAME IS SO USELESS I WASTED MONEY ON IT.   DONT BUY THIS GAME IF YOU ARE EXPECING REAL LIKE CAR HANDLING. I DONT KNOW IF IT IS THE FAULT OF STUPID DRIVE WHO IS HELPING THIS DEVELOPER OR IF ITS THE DEVELOPER.. END RESULT IS ITS A USELESS GAEM.   ALL CARS HAVE LOSE REAR END WHICH RIGHT BUT THE AMOUNT OF GRIP YOU HAVE ON REAR TIRE IS BAD.. ITS NOT REAL LIKE.   CAR SETUP IS ALSO USELESS. YOU CAN TRY ALL OF IT AND IF YOU HAVE LUCK, YOU WILL FIND SOME GOOD SETUP. MYSELF A AUTOMOBILE ENG AND WHEN I LOWER REAR TYRE PRESSURE AND ADJUST BREAK BS.. IT ALL HAS COUNTER EFFECT TO WHAT YOU SEE IN REAL LIFE..

3966	0	a	to sum it up, its one of those games where they tried too hard to make it seem realistic, but just made it bad.
3967	0	a	Nice cars, nice graphics. But the worst FFB i've ever seen ! Guys you did nothing and we must tweak the game to get something of it. Do not recommend this game because of that...
3968	0	a	Dont buy!
3969	0	a	Do you want a headache? If the answer is yes then this game is for you. You will have joy in learning what every little controller variable in the set up menu does as you try to get anything close to a realistic feel. You will expeirence the absolute joy in trying to get even a basic gamepad (xbox/ps) controller to work with this game. And you will have to do this for both a game pad and steering wheel everytime you start up the game, it's especially fun when the game crashes in the middle of races. Enjoy.
3970	0	a	I have bought this game only for VR experience. And this game very often brings headaches with customizing it each time that developer update it. Sometimes it doesn't work at all. Additional, when I am buying any game in Steam, their developers without any questions giving special Oculus Home key. But Developers of Project Cars give no reactions at all. It's too much for game that cost a lot. Looks like I will ask take my money back.
3971	0	a	Hell i can go around coners faster in my Chevrolet Silverado 3500 Duramax 6.6Ldual one ton and i am a real car car driver too so i know what i am talking about. i drove the m3 BMW in the game it drove like ♥♥♥♥ dont handle good and i have a m3 BMW i drive every day it handles good and drives great in real life. The cars in the game drive bad dont handle good. You dum programs need to drive real cars then drive the cars in the game u can see the diff mybe. Cars dont handle good like in the race games dirt 3, f1 2014, grid or Toca race driver 3, Need for speed Hot Pursuit, dirt, they have the cars driving like ♥♥♥♥ do not buy this game they need to fix it.
3972	0	a	About me: - The Project Gotham Racing games (1 and 2) on the original xbox were my favourite ever driving games.  - I find full race weekends tedious. - I hate 'Endurance races'. - I like to have fun when I play games. - I get a sense of achievement from expanding a minimal roster by spending 'kudos'/xp points. - I enjoy Grid Autosport. - I use a gamepad.  Project CARS bored me. Returned for refund.
3973	0	a	Beautiful game, handling with a gamepad makes the game almost unplayable.
3974	0	a	Not as fun as i expected. i first looked at the review on iGN before bying but i geuss you cant really know if you love it or not till you have tryed it. Play the game with a Razer Onza gamepad was just awful. The Cars felt way to heavy and even after adjusting sensitivity and dead zones ECT driving was still unpleasant and annoying. Maybe on console the game could be enjoyable. I wouldn't recommend buying.
3975	0	a	The most buggy game on earth, IT WONT EVEN GO FULL SCREEN FOR MY 3 DISPLAY SETUP!!!! ONLY WINDOWED
3976	0	a	Pros: Fantastic game great graphics even at lower settings amazing gameplay feels real fun af good online community great career mode HELMET VIEW tracks cars KARTS  Cons: unhandled exception error no fix for unhandled exception error unhandled exception error unhandled exception error crashes game at random times unhandled exception error sound is eh unhandled exception error

3978	0	a	This game..this game... at first it was the best racing game to date, but when i got further into the game i ran into an isuue.   This issue was that this game is far too complicated for a regular racing game fan. If you understand a lot about cars, this is the game for you. But for me its too big. There are loads and loads of configurations and options that i cant simply wrap my my head around. When i got to my second racing series, or whatever you want to call them, my car was uncontrolable, it was all over the place, i searched online for solution but ended up empty handed. when i say uncotrolable i mean it was all over the place, i couldnt even move forward, i was spinning circles and running into the terrain which got my frustraited enough to quit the game for good.   Short story short, if you know a lot about cars and theyr configurations, this is the game for you, otherwise DO NOT BUY THIS GAME or atleast get a cracked version first, just to try it out because this game isnt for everyone.
3979	0	a	another broken,buggy,overhyped garbage i think im gonna change my hobby
3980	0	a	It's pretty ♥♥♥♥.
3981	0	a	 I didnt find this game very fun...      There arent many cars    Career mode is boring    Not worth my money (sorry gaben)  
3982	0	a	Game hits 60fps at 1080p on a normal monitor but in VR it is almost unplayable on low settings.
3983	0	a	Nothing special here EDIT: I feel like I should reiterate - there is nothing original about this game that would warrant its purchase if you have played literally any other racing game since Gran Turismo 2
3984	0	a	For anyone who wanted this game for its hyped up realism, please just walk away. However if you enjoy difficult racing games whether the cars handle like ♥♥♥♥ or not then this might be the game for you :)
3985	0	a	Turned to ♥♥♥♥ at midpoint. Too bad.
3986	0	a	Solid racing game with realy bad AI racers and A LOT of bugs and i mean A LOT. (Piling up AI on start grid, steering ratios changing mid race, magically fuel dissapearing. Total physic ♥♥♥♥ups. etc. etc.)  Pretty crappy with controller. Funny with wheel.   Bug infested racing game with so much potential. Sad.   No honest person could recommend this game at this stage.
3987	0	a	Not even an full hour of gametime and i am already done with this. this game is impossible to play if you don't have an expensive steering wheel set.  You want to enjoy this game, buy a racing wheel set. with a regular controller it is simply impossible.  Kartracing is supposed to teach you the basics, all it does for me is when i hit a kart, my Kart angles up and loses all control.  I don't know about you but i have done karting myself and that is not supposed to happen.  this renders any gameplay absolutely impossible, i get penalized for everything that is out of my control.  Being pushed of the track costs me points.  this sucks.  Waste of money for me.
3988	0	a	DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!. It is not worth it, I have 200 hours in this game... i have tried to love it so hard, but it is imposible to love somthing this bad.  I can say it is pretty, but then so is watching motorsport on TV and you get far less issues with that and much more enjoyment.  This game is nothing but a buggy broken mess of a game that the developers seem to have no care for long time.   I am pretty angry writing this, because for the 2nd time in a row a race i competed in was lost because of a bug with refuling. I was doing the best i could do in the car i was in, actually bette the second time. both times in pit stops when i asked for 40L of fuel i got none. I have encountered nothing but bugs, the AI is hopless and just drives into you, the actual feel of the cars ir off most of the time, and well the online comunity racing? yeah i tried three times and none were good. do your self a favour buy a copy of the 2002 F1 championship Review on DVD, It will give you the same enjoyment you will recive in this game at a much lower price, that enjoyment factor being none.
3989	0	a	 iracing.com  is still the best
3990	0	a	
3991	0	a	This game is broken as F and the developer will tell you 'shut up you idiot' on the forum if you give constructive critisism.   Plus the lead dev (Ian Bell) looks like a potato with a face.
3992	0	a	not that great
3993	0	a	if you do not have a racing weel do not get this game it is crap with a 360 usb contraler same with mouse and keybored go to turn and the weels just stick even going slow and its always to the left for me i know its not my contaler i use it with my 360 no problem might be fun with a weel not sure just stay away if you want to have fun
3994	0	a	This game SUCKS! Not only does it keep crshing, but the game play is terrible. Worest driving simlator I've ever played. I WISH I could get a refound.
3995	0	a	Now I know I am not recommending this game, but that is solely based on personal opinion.   This game is beuatifully made, has excellent graphics, and its simulation engine is second to none. The reason I am not recommending this game is solely because I was looking for an arcade racer and this did not fit the bill.   Pros: Excellent Graphics Very realistic Great community  Cons: Not what I was looking for Doesnt have steam cloud, so i recommend using Gamesave manager
3996	0	a	This Angry Man Sums Up My Project Cars Frustrations So Far
3997	0	a	Not a fun racing game. Save your money and time dont buy it.
3998	0	a	zero support. what a joke. still haven't turned a single lap
3999	0	a	Don't buy this if you don't have a steering wheel. I tried it with xbox360 controller and it just s*cks and there is no way to fix it. Just google 'project cars countersteer' or 'project cars xbox controller' and see how many people got problems.  The user interface is the worst i've seen in the past years.
4000	0	a	They should have called this game RACECARS. Please tell me where the project is... There is no building or tuning.
4001	0	a	Simulator YES BUY IT! Racing game NOPE!  Really Really good simulator, stunning graphics and probably the best part of the game is the sound that comes out of the god damn cars, however nothing like i expected. boring and repedative gameplay with only about 20-30 cars that are all race spec cars and no customization or anything, just tuneing on an advanced level. I was expecting a game such as Forza or Grand Turismo with a collective gararge to obtain but you own everything on the get-go and career mode is the same. hense refunded however i was 50/50 questioning to hit yes or no on this recommendationg.  as for a simulator review, this is a MUST GET! it supports even playstation and xbox steering wheels!
4002	0	a	Absolute rubbish. The cars are competly unstable like you're driving on ice all the time.
4003	0	a	I really really was waiting this game! the game is not done yet!! a lot of problems! online racing SUCK BIG TIME.  the selection of cars very poor! I mean pffffffffffff....... a lot of stuff wrong!!! ASSESTTO is better BUT the father of simulator always will be GRAN TURISMO 4 . 5. and 6.   safe your money!   
4004	0	a	Project Cars has the best graphics to date for a racing game and the physics are just as amazing but for a high dollar game theres almost NO CONTENT! The amount of cars and tracks in this game is Despicable for the amount of dosh they expect you to throw at them.
4005	0	a	I regret ever getting this game. Too realistic. However, this game is very appealing visually, but not my cup of tea.
4006	0	a	This pice of crap doesn't work for me. It crashes and says some EXCEPTIONAL ACCESS ERROR and never crashes. I cant play it. I just bought the game and my pc is i5 6600k nvidia 1060 6gb and 16gb ddr4 ram. I mean WTF

4017	0	a	How project cars was made. 1. hire the guys behind shift 1 and 2. 2. strip off the tracks and cars from shift 2 game. 3. add some tracks and cars to the game. 4. change menu. 5. release unfinished broken game. (it has sections in the game with title 'coming soon', maybe if u pay more for dlc)  6. dont fix anything via 3 major patches. 7. sell dlc to cash more money. 8. rebrand project cars into project cars 2 and sell it again.  Sorry if i offended the fanboys but this is true.  Edit: 5 months after it has been released many bugs are still present in this game but the devs are only interested in hyping the next dlc. shame.
4018	0	a	It doesn't drive like Assetto... although it looks great the simulation side of it is not what I'm looking for, feels particularly arcade like after spending so many hours in the better product. Sorry fanboyz
4019	0	a	Want to not learn how to drive a car? Want to smash your keyboard into a million pieces? Want to imagine throwing your computer out onto the street and running it over with you fat mom? Well then this is the game for you! For only a rediculous amount of money can you play this STUPID game!!! Probably the worst game I could of ever spent that amount of money on. NEVER BUY THIS GAME!

4021	0	a	you cant buy cars, this is why game isnt so fun
4022	0	a	This was one of the worst car games ever because the cerar mode is very bad and the game is very buggy. I completly recoment The Crew
4023	0	a	Quick buyer's warning:  The game looks NOTHING like the screenshots on Steam. I was looking forward to this title in the hopes it would be a high fidelity racing game I'd enjoy on my stupidly overkill gaming PC. With all settings maxed (aside from AA) it looks like something you'd find on PS4 or Xbox One. Textures outside the car are sub-par. The crowds are immobile 3D sprites. The quality of the shaders is average at best. The shadows inside the cockpit were not looking too great.  As far as performance go it's good on my machine (i7-5930K/GTX 980 SLI/32GB DDR4) in 1080p which is no surprise. I keep a steady 120 to 140fps most of the time with all settings maxed (aside from AA). That's probably the best thing about this game, it runs great (so far).  For anyone intending to play this game with Keyboard &amp; Mouse you pretty much can't. I have found no options to customize my keys. You don't use the mouse at all. As far as I can see there are some options missing when you using a keyboard. After trying every single key on my keyboard twice I can confirm there are no options to change the camera view. The customization menu offers me controller controls, yet I have none connected to my machine.  I'll continue to play the game. I'll try my Logitech F310 controller and my Xbox One controller later when I have the chance to. Perhaps a patch will fix most of the issues, but as of now, this is looking close to a Watch Dogs. Show some pretty graphics to hype the game, but never deliver on them. All that's left is a modder unlocking them from the files.  So for the moment I can't recommend the game. Perhaps that'll change as I play. Perhaps it'll be much better with a controller, which is a shame because I love driving with my keyboard, as unreal as it might seem to some racing fans.
4024	0	a	Almost no customisation options, apart from some tire, brake and traction tuning stuff.  Serious lack of cars, like really, so bloody few cars it feels like I only got half a game.  ...but the worst thing is the terrible controller handling, it's 2015 for gods sake, could you not at least have gotten something so bloody important right ?  I mean really, one of the most important things, especially considering there's no realistic keyboard control options either (g'luck with that even if there was).  The handling of the Karts is a mess too, the 125CC's are fine but the 250CC's are a joke.  Wouldn't mind but the AI controlled karts in the 250cc bracket handle amazing at super top speed but you'll find it hard yourself to even keep yours in a straight line if using a controller and they end up flying all over the place when taking some corners, literally, flying, up off the ground, in the air, flying !  Meanwhile the computer controlled cars have cornered at top speed flawlessly and zipped past you.  Meh, I still like the game, I've a decent PC built and it looks great imo, real sense of speed when racing.  Just fix the controller handling, 250cc Kart handling, add a lot more cars and at least some basic customisation options apart from the under the hood tuning - would be happy enough then.
4025	0	a	Do not like this game at all, limited to track races only and cant customise cars like wat u could do in forza, recommended for a racing sim but not recommended as a casual racing game
4026	0	a	The game sounds and looks like ♥♥♥♥ DONT BUY IT
4027	0	a	Good grafics and all, but sucks
4028	0	a	Graphics are ok But the game has terrible controls,the cars do not respond or they turn of their own accord NFS Hot Pursuit,Dirt Showdown and Mario Kart are all better this is boring
4029	0	a	dont by it
4030	0	a	WHY THE ALT+F4 DONT WORK IN THIS GAME? CAN YOU ADD IT ?
4031	0	a	Don't launch with the project cars desktop icons and by Steam library on window 7 64 bits. Don't know which has tested this game but works is not well done.  4 years to do that LOLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL 
4032	0	a	This game is great, it really is. The driving is great. Wide variety of cars. Heaps of tracks. Deep career mode. Car tuning. Statistics. Multiplayer. Community Events. Time Trial.... and more to come in the future !  There is just one problem here, it doesn't feel as amazing as it is. Not as in the feeing of the cars(which is very good) but in things like how information is presented. The menus are just messy and confusing. It doesn't make you feel like a race driver. You really have to try and ignore the presentation of the game and imagine how much better it could be to make the game feel great.  I played the game during early access and always thought they had just never quite have the greatest user interface and menus, something I thought would be overhauled by the time. The full release is here and nothing has changed. It is a strange thing because it HAS all the features and everything in the game already; there is nothing missing from the game. It is just waiting to be unleashed.  This is what I think will put most people off the game because they won't realised how great the game is hidden behind the bad visual presentation(again the graphical visuals are crisp and clean and very well done)... The thing about this is that I can see signs of a great presentation all of the place, I just feel if SMS took the time to redesign how the game was presented they could have really made this the amazing game that it is.  It's like the room got messy and they didn't bother to clean it up, everything is in the room but it is just jumbled around everywhere and all you can see is a mess if you don't know where anything is or what it does.  For any game trying to make it with a mainstream audience the presentation is much more important than the gameplay, in fact presentation IS gameplay. It's like when you go to a expensive resturant and everything is expertly cooked and everything about the taste is perfect, but if made it to your table and it just didn't look very apealing you probably won't enjoy it as much simply because it didn't look that good. You would feel a bit ripped off. With such a great game you need great presentation. I just couldn't recommend the game in the state it is and I don't know if it will get better with time when the problem is so fundamental. I couldn't imagine SMS doing such a big change to the presentation.
4033	0	a	Some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ran me off the track on the last lap of a race. So I tried to go the oppisite direction on the track and get in a head-on collision with as many cars as I could but the game ended the race and discualified me, ruining both my fun and my immersion.  Isn't that good looking, for a car game.  Controlls feel weird, and somewhat unrealistic at least with a controller.  I don't understand who this game is for. If you're looking for realistic get Forza. If you're looking for arcadey, get Burnout Paradise.
4034	0	a	Before you rate this down with 15 alt accounts, and spampost below, I would like to tell you something.    - Pre-Introduction -
4035	0	a	Stupid game, you can't even get out of the car lol. Were they even trying? Also the game is an unoriginal GTA copy
4036	0	a	28 mins of gameplay and i already broke my xbox controler cause the cars would just go straight in the ditch or do a 180 turn. (no its not my gamepad i tried with keyboard and my wheel as well) 0/10 would not recommend this game to anyone
4037	0	a	Cars handle like sh*t on a controller.   Lack of cars.  Looks nothing like screenshots.  The difficulty of actual racing offline is too easy with assists, but the cars still handle like crap, must be super easy when it works.  Your car will slide about doing 30 MPH and and heading in a straight line.  Overall really crap controller support, GFX no where near screenshots and pre rendered stuff. (i have everything maxed out) Poor amount of cars, lack of actual car editing like weight, and engine stuff.  The physics are wrong. It feels like a development build with a lot of work left on it.
4038	0	a	Review: ------------------  -Trash- ------------------ End of review.
4039	0	a	It's full of bugs and all you do is pointless driving without clans or leaderboard
4040	0	a	I had the game longer than 2 days , i'm banned on project cars forums than after that they deleted my game from my game inventory do not buy or support these devs. 
4041	0	a	Screenshot Simulator 2015  EDIT: Saying as how NO major changes were made to the game in order to improve it in any significant way, I can only assume this game is still in the same broken state as it was at its release. The constant influx of positive reviews is indicitive of how rabid the community was for shilling the game before it even released, as most of the reviews talk nothing about the actual content of the game or what it does well.  Abandon all hope yee who enter here.

4050	0	a	'it's a no from me.' - simon cowell
4051	0	a	Don't....just don't even think in buying this if you look for a simulation...this is far from it... The bugs turn this into a pile of manure! There are no physics present..or Earth physics for that matter.. Drive in game the same car I own in real life...and no...just NO! not even close, because my car can make turns at 50kmh...in this game, you just can't!   WORST CAR SIMULATION EVER!
4052	0	a	Great game, Driving is very realistic, Damage is very realistic. Only thing I don't like is lack of customizing cars, buying and owning your own cars, I hope they add a DLC that adds customizing.  I don't recommend this game because of the lack of customizing options. They have allot of tracks but not the most like they promised. If you like to just race realistic this game is for you. I am glad I did not pay but half price for it.  The graphics are alright, Nothing like the screenshots though, I have everything on ultra and its no where near as good as the screenshots.
4053	0	a	I do not like this game because of the lack of vehicles. I would not reccomend this game to anyone who wants to be able drive almost any car like forza.  
4054	0	a	if your not a veryyyyyyyyyyyyy patient person dont buy this game .
4055	0	a	Drifting in this game suck... If you want gr8 sim you need to buy assetto corsa, not this one. Graphics ain't everythin
4056	0	a	Not enough cars. 
4057	0	a	Very very limited Oculus Rift Support! Most feature are completely Unavailable when using VR! Unfinished Product!  Game absolutely horrible without the help of third party sofware on the Oculus Rift! Not too mention all the features that are completely Unavailable when using VR No Telemetry, No Lap info, Split/Delta, Speed, no Map and no Gear info etc. Nope not if you use the Oculus Rift not to mention you have to open and close the game to set things up can't use menus while using VR and too think these a holes advertised Oculus Rift support well that's BS! Where is the integrity great game but Very limited VR and no support or even a simple paragraph of info for the Oculus Rift. The game does work in VR but again most features don't so why advertise that it does? Once you set up third party software and read forums on how to setup, game play with the Oculus Rift DK2 is great but only after hours of adjustments! But not so great seeing I just payed $50 for a game that has 'Oculus Rift Support' in big letters on their website. So yeah great game false advertising! This is an UNFINISHED PRODUCT! I have filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission (and many other agency's) I hope Slightly Mad Studios gets Fined!   Note: review is for VR other than that I'm enjoying game would give it a rating of 8.5 or better as far as the game itself goes!
4058	0	a	I am looking for a game similar to Forza, and this has to be the closest. This game needs one thing to be fun, a rewind otpion while racing.
4059	0	a	Negative because it's not Crossplatfrom.
4060	0	a	Call this suck ♥♥♥ game slip slide racing............... I want my money back
4061	0	a	its a bad game there is no point to the carrer you already get the very little cars that are in the game and there is no custimization what so ever the controls aren the best i say its not worth the 50$ and looks like more of a free to play game
4062	0	a	So, although I've only driven for 10 minutes I can already tell you that this game is just not worth the money. Assetto Corsa, a game that costs less and is not even finished feels far better over all, has better graphics and is a game that I actually like to play. Project Cars feels like a console game in regards to the graphics and the way cars handle - Unless it's a bug, any car apart from an LMP1 car is impossible to control and is just plain unrealistic. Although it may seem small, the sun rays and lens flare effects when in first person are almost blinding and glitch through decals on the windscreen every few seconds (plenty more bugs like it appeared throughout my 20 minute experience) - I really didn't expect this from a £40 2015 'driving simulator'...If you're not willing to purchase Assetto Corsa however, Project Cars is almost certainly the second best option for you - It is up there when it comes to PC driving games (due to the very low number available), but due to the cost and high anticipation I had for it, I'm incredibly dissapointed - Assetto Corsa is just a better game overall. It is very early days however and so I'll give it time but for now, back to Assetto Corsa.
4063	0	a	GRID Autosport is far better when it comes to handling the car and how it actual feels to drive. The graphics is not good either. Feels like playing a 5 yo game.
4064	0	a	I wanted to update my review on Project CARS as I can no longer recommend this title.  Why? Because it's a boring game. For a racing game, it is so god awfully boring to drive or race. Racing is more of a chore than it is fun in this game, especially do to the awful AI that essentially ramps its speed up or down depending on the 0-100 slider. The way that AI is leagues faster in the rain, has incredibly erratic pit schedules, and just overall seems to be driving a different race than you, is frustrating. For those who have played Civ V in great depth, it's reminiscent of how the highest difficulty AI doesn't necessarily outplay you - it just plays a different sets of rules than you.  The physics in the game are good to me, but it falls in this strange area of not exactly sim, but not at all arcadey. I (somewhat controversially) prefer it to Assetto Corsa, which feels like cars on ice skates, but it still isn't 'fun' to drive. Many of the cars are just plain awful to drive, and on top of that, they don't feel fast. It's a strange sensation to be going down the Mulsanne at 180+ mph and not feel any sense of speed. This makes free lapping feel bland and doesn't drive me to try and beat my times. Coupled with few cars/tracks and numerous cars/tracks locked behind DLC, and it's awful.  Online is particularly dead these days unless you get involved with some sort of league, which are still small.   From a technical standpoint, graphics are outstanding, sounds are very good, and setting up controls were fairly simple for me.  In short, it's a pretty game with nothing fun to do inside of it. Racing the AI is boring, being alone is just useless, and there's so much cut content that you'll be paying $50+ to hotlap for 5 minutes and then go play something else.
4065	0	a	Nope, not even after 7 patches the first year (!!) can this game bring any joy. Buggy physics, crappy AI (worse than Assetto Corsa) and the dev just keeps pumping out DLC like once a month. Don't buy this game, not even during a Steam Sale. The game causes more frustrated than joy, and fails at every point possible except for graphics. But a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game that is beautiful is still a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game.
4066	0	a	EDIT: Since the game has been released... Nothing much has been progressed. It still misses a lot of tracks, it still misses a great car roster and it misses modding options. The worst of it all is that PCars 2 has already been announced with all features that were promised during the crowdfunding to go in to Pcars 1 untill they suddenly changed the entire feature schedule!  They also add a few cars per month via a paid 'On Demand' system. With some cars in them that should have been standard in the game already or atleast made free. This is just ridiculous.  So yeah, stay away from this game unless you fancy graphics, physics and a few cars that you can race in. Nothing much else really.  My previous (naïeve) review:  --- Where to begin... well, lets just name all the positives and negatives for now:  Positive: - Absolutely amazing sounds, music and overall sound quality per car - Graphics are something never seen before in other racing games and every track still amazes me in how much detail they have put in it - Rookie to Pro career, IF you want! No strings if you go from F1 driver to Kart racer - Online with a massive options list for you to shape your own online session - The physics! YES! - Helmet cam immersion - Amazing weather effects  negatives: - Low track count. Coming from Forza, Gran Turismo and a heap of other racing games, I find the tracks to be on the 'meh, It works, but I miss some of my and my friends' favourites...' side - Low car list, really nothing much. Nissan GTR fans, sorry, its not (yet) there. List will hopefully improve as time progresses!  And thats about it for now! ---
4067	0	a	This game is crap compared to Grand Turismo 5!
4068	0	a	After what is something like almost a year after release the game gives the exact same feeling: an unfinished product. What really strucks my though is that SMS rather than concentrating in completing the game are releasing DLC's with a few cars + tracks each. This is simply ridiculous. I am not planning to invest neither on this game nor on the upcoming PC2.  Now as far as it concerns the gameplay itself: If you drive a real simulator such as Assetto Corsa and then jump in the same car-track combination driving on Project CARS you will immediately realise why this game simply sucks. It's almost like half the driving experience is not there (needless to say both games require a steering wheel). In a couple of words this is a NFS shift re-release for god sake...
4069	0	a	hmmmm This game is arcade
4070	0	a	Nope. The game itself is good but that's not the point. I don't like a game which does work really fine on a certain hardware, and doesn't on the other. This is not fair, I don't like this kind of acting. Devs say all the opposite but when you try it, when you see it how it works, when you read many facts then you get that this is not a fair treatment on both sides. Just no. Shameful politics, that's it.
4071	0	a	Compared to Assetto Corsa this is arcade racing.
4072	0	a	I've played about 6 hours (2 were AFK) but these are my impressions so far.  I've been told this game is excellent with a wheel, but I cannot confirm this as I sold my racing wheel a while back. I'm playing with an Xbox One controller. The default settings for the controller are absolutely TERRIBLE. Steering is WAY too sensitive, brakes are not sensitive enough. You have to adjust deadzones and sensitivity for nearly everything. And even then, they are still lacking. The game doesn't punish you for using assists like Forza does but the developers unfortunately have still not gotten past their NFS days of LOL OVERSTEER and cars are too subject to loss of grip from any reasonable amount of acceleration, even in a straight line. With TCS on, they behave much more realistically and only oversteer when they should. Unless you have a wheel and pedals, you're going to want the assists on.  That said, there's a good bit of content and realism, and there's interesting stuff to be seen in the singleplayer seasons. There's tons of disciplines of racing, tons of goals to reach and different vehicles to master. I'm doing kart racing right now, and aside from a few very annoying mistakes made by AI that ended up in me going from first to last place (2nd Place Driver: WHAT ARE BRAKES?) the races are fun, and you can set the length depending on how patient you are and how much time you've got on your hands. I've also done LMP2, GT3, Road car racing, and Clio touring cars. Everything seemed to handle very well with assists on (as I said, the game issues a huge '♥♥♥♥ you' to anyone who doesn't have a wheel and turns off the assists)  There is presently an issue with online racing where it's very unclear what to do after qualifying. There's a countdown timer but all options other than Quit are greyed out in this menu. One would assume you are supposed to press 'Quit', since it's the only option, and then you'd be put in the lobby to wait for the other players to finish their final qualifying lap and then prepare to race. However, Quit kicks you out of the session. I figured it out before pressing it luckily but I've had several sessions where we went from ~7-10 players to ~3-5 players because they hit 'quit' after the qualifying lap.   Car Selection: All cars are unlocked from the start, which is a huge plus because you don't have to start from the bottom with some slow car and work your way up, you're free to race whatever discipline or spec you want from the second you start the game. However, the car selection is rather lacking. I hope you like European cars, because pretty much everything in the game is European. There is ONE Japanese car. One. And It's a Lancer Evo road car. There's one American Ford, everything else is Ford UK. There are no Lamborghinis or Ferraris, no Toyotas, Nissans or Subarus, no Corvettes. It's missing so many cars. Developers say they are adding more as DLC and more for free, but seeing as Forza Horizon 2, a game which had a severely cut down car list from even Forza 5, which had a even more severely cut down car list from Forza 4, has 225 cars without any DLC, I'm going to have to complain about this one.
4073	0	a	Good game. Was hopping for a more realistic carreer simulator like having to worry about repairs and money ect ect. but still more reason to play than just good graphics and unlocking more pointless cars such as forza and GT. Problems are all over the place though. controls are way to weak at times, unplayable with high power cars in the rain. Played 30 hours or so and uninstalled it.
4074	0	a	Was an excellent Racing simulator. Stay from this game! nothing but trouble! seriously! Career mode save gets wiped clean from out of nowhere..
4075	0	a	As a Gran Turismo player since 2012, I'm glad that I tried something new. Deep and demanding but user-friendly, it's Project CARS.  Well, it's been over a year and I have to admit, I expected more for the 50€ (Previous base price), let's have a summary what the simulator does like before, the praise and critics.  You can either start up with a career from kart till Le Mans, or go straight to your desired races with a big selection of tracks and cars, weather and competitors. Multiplayer is included too of course and you can compete with the whole globe during online time races. What I most liked are the graphics, especially the weather effects impressed me. The textures, sounds, everything. As long as your hardware can take it. It's 'alright' optimized for AMD cards, while Nvidia cards can run it much better seemingly because of PhysX effects. In the other hand, the physics are not as good as Gran Turismo and I could barely adapt to it. All racing simulators I play are controlled with a gamepad and I'm fine with that even without driving aids like on Gran Turismo. Unfortunately, Project CARS is another case. I tried to adjust dead zones and sensitivity here and there and it's just not comfy enough. Sometimes I don't feel guilty for an accident, some scenarios just aren't understandable so I have to use plenty driving aids to barely enjoy the game. Especially the AI gets me nuts sometimes, when the 2nd placed driver spins my ride fabulously right at the end of the race, and so on.  So what have we got now? Loads of unnecessary expensive DLC? Most of the ongoing online time races are DLC restricted? A new base price of 30€? Already working on Project CARS 2 and leaving the first one behind that fast?  Project CARS had so much potential to me. But at the end, I just feel ripped off. I pretty much respect the developers that they created a simulator with their own preferations, without the dependence of EA like on NFS: SHIFT which I also liked. Still, my expectations werent met at all.   Since refunds are possible, I recommed you to make your own idea of Project CARS. However, my thumb turned to a red one.
4076	0	a	Overall it's a really good game, with amazing graphics (no other racing game comes even close), amazing sounds and models. Car physics works really well too. My only complaints are 1. Bots are incredibly stupid, they ram you at every chance they get and 2. For some reason SMS don't believe in saving your controls (if you switch between wheel and controller like I do you're gonna have a bad time) and saving your hud settings. But overall the game is awesome and most of the DLCs are worth it too!  Update: This game is largely unchanged, same issues still exist. Bots still don't acknowledge your existence, and the problem with the HUD's settings is still there. But they have no problem in putting out more and more DLCs. They give us an Indy car and stock cars but no oval track, yep makes so much sense. And so I will no longer play this game, the visuals and the sounds are polished very well but that's it. I'd much rather play Dirt Rally, a much much more realistic and enjoyable driving experience.

4079	0	a	Overall a very well rounded product at release and will only get better with future updates and support The good FFB/physics Career mode and the best ive seen in any racing title to date Multiplayer net code Very good ai compared to the majority of racing games Sounds great, maybe not RRE good but still very good Graphics......No other racing title compares Modern easy to use UI Leaderboards and community events dedicated servers The bad No current triple screen support at launch but word is its in the works  alot of ffb sliders with little info on what each do BUT....once you you do some research and figure them out it brings every car ingame to life and becomes extremely enjoyable! I would have liked to see some more cumminty/club features like what was in forza 4 where you could form a clan, have a clan prefix infront of your gt, share tunes and paints etc aswell as a private league support like iracing where you could create an online series and track the point standings. sadly amd gpu on multi screen setups dont perform all that great and need to lower some settings, but still looks great. SMS have done alot of optimization and now claim its up to AMD to optimize there drivers for this title.  Overall an excellent well rounded product that every racer will enjoy be it hotlappers, offline or multiplayer!

4081	0	a	I am a long time player of Blood Bowl, starting with the 2nd edition of the tabletop game, through to the nineties MS-DOS computer game, to not-Blood-Bowl-honest Chaos League and finally Blood Bowl 1/Legendary/Chaos. The thing I loved about Blood Bowl 1 was the single player options, from creating a custom league, to participating in a classic competition from Blood Bowl canon, and of course even playing a proper full career, clawing your way up the rankings over the years, up against all the famous classic teams of Blood Bowl lore, winning cups and trophies along the way until eventually, hopefully, winnng the Blood Bowl trophy itself.  Now comes Blood Bowl 2; the graphics are prettier, but graphics aren't everything. The part that matters to me, the gameplay, the thing I loved in Blood Bowl 1 is... gone. The single player campaign is a shadow of what it was before. You can create a custom league, but there are no proper tournaments from Blood Bowl canon, and certainly no proper career. You play a few games in a single tournament, and then you are done. And the classic teams don't even appear in these leagues anymore. The whole thing is clearly obsessed with multiplayer, to the point that even in single player games the game still looks, feels and plays just like the multiplayer version, with randomised AI team creations clearly trying to pass themselves off as player teams. But it doesn't work. To take examples, the Broad Axes team might have the emblem of a Bugman's tankard, while Bugman's Faithful might have the emblem of an axe. Eh? It's randomisation gone mad. It makes no sense. And as I said, there are no Reikland Reivers or Gouged Eye or Chaos All Stars. Unless you play the introductory 'tutorial', or single one off matches without continuity, you will never see the classic teams of Blood Bowl lore at all. That's just not good enough. For me, without the ability to play a league or proper career with your own team against the classic sides of history, the appeal just isn't there.   And there are other disappointments. You can't improve/modify a player's armour any more. Many of the other options of old just aren't available. The font is - to my eyes - some horrible thin eyesore - and the UI just ugly, literally not pleasing on the eyes. Meanwhile the commentators Jim and Bob now insist on actually appearing, but just get in the way. In short, while this game might be a multiplayer's paradise, it doesn't work for me. Maybe Blood Bowl 1 spoiled me, but to my mind Blood Bowl 2 is several steps backwards.  Now this might sound like I'm some kind of hater. But I am a fan of Blood Bowl and for the sake of the franchise I sincerely hope that people out there are enjoying this, and I wish the game very well. I do want this to succeed. But the single player aspect desperately needs work. The single player game is an opportunity to offer players content that multiplayer content cannot provide - such as a proper career. But it simply doesn't. For me personally, Blood Bowl 2 is a big disappointment, and until the single player game is improved I will be sticking with Blood Bowl 1, because unfortunately, for solo play, Blood Bowl 1 remains far superior.
4082	0	a	So much promise!  Played Blood Bowl Legendary edition extensively.  All the things I loved about the first one is gone.   Now we have: -Clunky menus fit for a console. -Mysteriously vanished options for saving ingame. -No visual progression on your players as they level up -A total lack of faces for your players. Twins or even triplets in your lineup is a must it seems. -Tiny, no info log. -no singleplayer campaign except for the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ tutorial 'campaign'.  You done ♥♥♥♥ed it up Cyanide!!!
4083	0	a	Blood Bowl 2, Learn to salt again.  Played several games now and I don't know what to think. It's sure prettier than Chaos Edition (Blood bowl 1, all add-ons), and the client seems more usable. But there is so much in it that just irks me. This product doesn't seem to deserve its price bracket:  -Fewer teams, I know more are coming, but I also know they are going to be add on DLC at an as yet unknown price. At £35, thas a bitter pill to swallow. It also makes some teams indirectly weaker, with all but one of the current teams being relitively tough, or having easily available tough units, this makes a block/injury focused team less affective.  -Lack of assets, there are only 2 spectator models, ork with drum and human in armour. Stadiums are all identicle until leveled up with small differences that have nothing to do with their starting theme. Players have only one model and sometimes an alterable face (per unit type obviously).  -Poorly thought out UI. For the most part better than BB1 but with a host of new flaws that I'm hoping will be fixed dispite being identified early in testing and still being there now. For instance, team purchasing, in which you ask players to purchase units without allowing them to pick extras. This means that new players will end up spending all their ingame cash on units without getting vital re-rolls, because re-rolls are purchased later.  -Poor single player experience. Yes it is a 2 player board game, but we were promised a decent single player experience. But the 'Campaign' mode is a drawn out and frackly dull tutorial, while league mode doesn't even attempt to hide the fact that its just a bot game generated at your teams current point value. Combine this with a bafflingly inconsistant AI, and I can't see why I should play this over Chaos Edition right now.
4084	0	a	Well, this game is the definition of one step forward, two steps back.  So, this is what we get after almost a year of delays. Well, let's get to it, then.  Stepping in the right direction: + Better UI. + New Race: Brettonians. + Better Graphics. + Easy to invite Steam friends to a friendly match of Blood Bowl.  Retreading same old footsteps: = The announcers are back, and they are just as fun to listen to. This time they even come with subtitles that don't match half the time and can't be turned off. = Solo Old World League seems a solid replacement for the original Campaign, albeit with a penchant for fielding as many as 4 same race teams in its divisions. = It's Blood Bowl. = Customization ups the ante with choosing uniform patterns instead of just a single colour, but scales it back again by letting you only change the players' heads.  And, of cousre, the backsteps: - No mid-match 'quit and save' option in single-player, except in the campaign. As clumsy as the old SaveBetweenHalves/Drives-&gt;AbandonMatch-&gt;QuitWithoutSaving routine was, there was, at least, a way.  - The Campaign (Story Mode) is just an extended tutorial utilizing the Reikland Reavers (Human).  - Blitz Mode is gone. No more custom gear for you. - Back to 8 teams? Are you joking? Chaos Edition had 23. 23!  - No team-specific cheerleaders. Human cheerleaders for everyone! - Very limited graphical options (Resolution, Quality presets, Grass, Spectators).  - No full screen option. What is this, 1995?  So, in the end, yes, I would recommend the game, but only if the following conditions are met: 1. You don't own the Chaos Edition of the original Blood Bowl. 2. Blood Bowl II is on sale for $30 or less.
4085	0	a	Traded out quick gameplay for gimmicky graphical ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Otherwise it's identical to Blood Bowl I, with most of the races cut out to be sold as DLC and a completely gutted single player campaign.* It's actually a lesser game than its predecessor in every single way other than graphics, and even the UI is klutzy and awkward comparatively.  *You can make a league, which is a 40 team elimination tournament. There's an actual Campaign mode, but it's like playing a tutorial for eight thousand games, where your team is selected for you and cutscenes can't be skipped.
4086	0	a	Promising but unfinished...where are all the teams?....the crowds are all one human guy wearing differant colours and all the pitches are grass.. to name but a few problems.  Largely unfinished and releasing it was a mistake, all the negative press and reviews could of been avoided if they'd just finished the game....... Currently i can't recommend Blood Bowl 2 for the price its technically still a beta, give it 6 months to a year, DO NOT buy it now play BB1 and save your money for a while....  A year later is it since i wrote the above?.... and the crowd are still generic humans, cheerleaders all the same, ok more races but the content is coming at a snails pace, i'm still not changing to recommend sorry. For some only known to Dev's reason they have also removed the few females there were from the previous game and made it even more of a sausage fest...There is NO logic in Developer World, its just raw imcompetent money grabbing chaos.
4087	0	a	An awful let down, the developers haven't listened to what the community wanted. They've delivered a console-centric game that's currently, and likely to remain, inferior to the original version and not a patch on the board game or FUMBBL. The list of disappointments is too long to go into, though amongst the worst offenders are the console-centric cut down options and UI, the AI that (despite devloper claims) is exactly as bad if not worse that in the original, the treacly performance on decent machines, the lack of visible levelling on players, lack of star players and the temerity to change the rules of an established and hugely playtested game. Suffice to say i've tried to get a refund for this and would not recommend it to anyone in it's current state. 
4088	0	a	So, I can't recommend this game for several reasons. Although Blood Bowl is a really fun blend of strategy and RNG, the implementation of this is poor. Single player is OK - the campaign is just an extended tutorial, and not actually challenging. Although the commentators are mildly entertaining and most games the AI has some gimmick to keep you interested, its clear the game is geared towards multiplayer.   Unfortunately, multiplayer is awful. Matchmaking times are ridiculously long, and the longer you're in queue, the less the game cares about an even matchup. Using petty cash to even out the odds is inadequate to really level the playing field and allow a fair competitve match. Furthermore the game doesn't use MMR - matchmaking is determined by you're teams gold value, not winrate. So player skill isn't taken into account and experienced players with low TV teams destroy any newer players. Also since there's no real incentive to win, and no penalty for conceding, the leagues are infested with Chaos teams whose sole aim is to kill and injure your players. If you try to injure their players back in return, they'll just concede. Also, the main league - NAF - has ageing on for some reason, which is a stupid rule. All your prized players you spend ages levelling up will eventually retire.   Other complaints include a shoddy UI, a distinct lack of teams compared to the previosd Blood Bowl, and the devs being very slow to update the game or add new content. They also seem unwilling to actually balance the game, and allow CPOMB teams to run rampant in every league, which is completely anti-fun. The game itself also runs very poorly, with low framerate and really long animations that are unskippable and leave you unable to do anything while the animation plays out. Often you will run out of time each turn because the game runs so badly. Games also last too long - 16 turns each at 2minutes per turn is 1hr 12mins for turn timers, however ONTOP of that is time for animations/cutscenes ansd kickoff/events/injuries. The entire game feels like it needs to be sped up. For the full price its definitely not worth it. If you're a hardcore Blood Bowl fan and don't mind playing against Chaos/Nurgle every match then maybe pick it up on sale.
4089	0	a	I was really expecting great things from BB2, but I'm sad to say I'm rather disappointed. I can't give it a positive review for now, even if I hope that if some issues are corrected and more content injected to the game, I will gladly change my review.  The Good: - Nice graphics - It's Blood Bowl... It's brutal, it's fun, it's challenging. But well, that's thx to the board game rules, the videogame adds little to that. - Cool multiplayer with permadeath: it adds a sense of danger everytime you play, it's fun. - Cleaner HUD. There has been a lot of complaints about the 'player cards', but I find it not so annoying, it's rather clear and nice.  The Bad: - The campaign is crap: you only play 1 human team, with false rules. It's utterly boring, not worth your time if you already know BB1. - The solo content is mediocre: the solo leagues are just multiplayer leagues but with AI. It all feels too generic for me, games are chained without other things to do inbetween apart from the rare level up. It feels really empty. - No player stats: that's the major complain for me, what's the point of playing games after games when you have no player stats (how many TD, passing, blocking, etc...) and leaderboards between all teams?? That's the basic feature missing that is the cause that I don't want to play anymore: I just don't see the point. - No visual enhancemnent when players level up: it's not major, but the lack of all these little features makes that you don't care for your team players, because they stay the same even if they are über strong. - Games are veeeery long: solo or multi, one game lasts in average 1:30 hours... It's too long! For just one quick game, when you don't have that much time to play anymore, you know you must reserve 2h of your time to play just a little game... - In solo, you can't speed up turns like you could in BB1: it made the whole thing a lot less repetitive. - The commentaries from Jim &amp; Bob become repetitive very quick.  The Good to Have: - It's not major, but watching the same hit animation over and over when you block someone become really dull after a while, considering that you block A LOT during a match. I would have launched this animation only on big hits like injuries. - Where are the women? There's only 1 female player type + the duplicates pom pom girls. A strong lack of variety here, it's not made to help making women play this kind of games... - Eye candy: different pom pom for each race, a real spectating crowd, etc... What I don't understand too, is why making a big solo campaign with a lot of animation and what not, but for kick-off events you just have one poor line of text where you could have cool animations? (like, spectators trampling players...)  SO that's that, my major complaint is that in solo, the content is very thin and don't want to make you take care about your team and see it to the top, and in multiplayer it's good but the matches are very, very long so it's a strong barrier, for me at least.  Hope the game will be updated and devs will listen to the community! It can become very cool.
4090	0	a	Revised: 12/12/2015 They started selling currency as of a recent patch. This is harmful as that currency can be used to gate access to competitions, the fact is, they could change the games economy in a number of ways, addng a real money tap on the back end gives them alot of freedom to slowly tweak things, look what Konami did with 'insurance' in MGSV.  You might say, but it's not objectively dangerous, it's just pretend money used to buy cosmetics, but IAP was not in the game I paid money for, its a feature I never asked for and do not appreciate, they are only suggesting skins will be gated behind 'cyan' coins. But you get 1000 for £40 if you get the largest pack 20 for £1.49 with the smallest. 20 cyans gets you one skin for one team, and I imagine, it won't be enough to get a other 'fun features' when they are added later.  I do wish there was a 'level thumb' because I do have mixed feelings, the game has a few teething issues with skills not being implimented and the optionality of skills not being in game and a few stupid rule tweajs Cyanide made which are mandatory and unwelcome, but the real sticking point they are already charging £5 a team, they have their ongoing revenue stream to support development, cyan coins are just farming 'whales' for money.  BB1 set a precident which lead to me buying BB2, and they are falling short of my expectations, they might well fall short of yours too.
4091	0	a	In it's current state, I see very few reasons you'd pick this over the Chaos Edition of BB1.  The graphics are significantly nicer, but that's about it. Rules have been changed, bugs are still present, the single player is an absolute joke of a drawn out tutorial, but the killer is there's only 8 teams. I don't think it's so much a problem that you don't have access to more, rather that when playing online, you're only going to be seeing those 8 teams. It gets very stale, and without some of the more 'fun but garbage' teams, games just play out the same time after time.
4092	0	a	The controls are clunky and the game constantly misinterprets your desired actions without the ability to correct them ruining any strategies you try to play, the campaign is drawn out with long, uninteresting and unskipable cutscenes and you can't even choose your race for it.  Stick with the first one and the Chaos Edition, they are far superior!
4093	0	a	The lack of races make it not as good as BB1: Chaos Edition. The new animations are awesome and everything looks great but it lacks the variety that BB1 has and as such I find myself going back and playing that. When more races are out, definitely will recommend.
4094	0	a	The game is ok, but give it time to stew this game still requires more work and its slightly over priced for what its worth, pick it up on a sale etc but for now i would not recommend this game. Underneath i put some points i liked and disliked  other players are voicing their issues with the game on the discussion boards i'd like to point this one out as being a really good example with problems in the current build    http://steamcommunity.com/app/236690/discussions/0/523897204944724525/     The good     The UI is much better than the previous game displaying the percentage chance on rolls and popping up cards showing the stats of the characters in question are really nice and easy to understand.  The commentators are on point with great witty banter.  The musics good.     The not so good     The animations are pretty sweet but still very limited, seeing your teams march out at halftime with a low camera is an epic sight to see but there is not much difference in the way characters tackle, so each time your characters makes a tackle regardless of who is around and what direction they're coming from the tackle is the same. Goblins do tackle different from humans etc, but as pointed out, the goblins tackle is its only tackle with no variaton.  The graphics have improvmed on the original although not by that big of a deal. Its 2015, the game looks to be on par with Dawn of war 2 and other games that came out about 5 years ago, not a big deal for me still id of liked it to be better.     The bad     There arent that many teams on launch, even the Pre-order bonus teams arent available on release.  The graphics options are extremely limited with only preset settings such as Very low, low normal high and very high, enable grass and spectators and resolution. Thats it.  Volume is the same with 3 options on 3 fixed sliders: FX Music Comments all going from 0 - 10.  The Tutorial is once again sorely lacking for any new comers to the game with no showing of how the calculations are done.  The campaign mode is a huge step backwards from the original, i prefered where i could pick my own team and lead them through a campaign rather than a single story mode.
4095	0	a	I am a HUGE Blood Bowl player, starting with the tabletop game in the '90s. I played the original PC edition years ago and really enjoyed it. As far as I can tell, this is a fun, faithful recreation of the Blood Bowl I enjoy. BUT. I bought this so I can play against the AI. That's all I really want to do-- I don't want to use this to play other people online, because I don't want to be tied down for 2-3 hours at a time to finish a game. And what do I find out? Against the AI, there is NO SAVE GAME feature. Meaning, even though I'm playing a solo game on my own terms, I can not stop a game and restart it at my own convenience. I think this is a huge oversight. I hate to do it, because it does seem like a good, fun game, but I can not recommend this for other people like me.
4096	0	a	I like the graphics and the new format, but mostly play single player which kind of is a joke for now. There is no real campaign or offline mode, and the AI is really, really stupid. It is hard to overstate how stupid it is.  I can live with the AI being stupid since it can just get other advantages if I can just have some form off offline campaing.
4097	0	a	I've played both BB1 and BB2 a lot.  I recommend you to stick with BB1. BB2 is full of bugs and the AI is a joke. The campaign is kinda fun, but extremely buggy, and only playable with humans...what a bore. And where are did all the races go?  And worst so far: many players, myself included has a problem with the screen going black for no reason. Despite many people reporting this on the forums, no response from the publisher is seen.  Maybe the game will be fixed to a playable level in the future.. for now though, save your money, keep on playing BB1.
4098	0	a	This is a no purely because I like playing against the computer. If you like to play PVP instead of playing against the AI the game would get a thumbs up. If however the idea of a long campaign and single player storylines is what you are after, this is not the game to get. I purchased this game (after owning Blood Bowl 1) because I read in a review that the AI had been improved. Sadly that is not the case. I played the entire campaign, over 15 games, and did not get scored on at all throughout the entire thing. If you like playing against other people and miss the leagues that were in BB1, there are leagues going on here, and you can get some games in that way.
4099	0	a	I love blood bowl since the boardgame, but this version of it has so many bugs that it gets frustrating. I have had players get KO'd without being hit. The game forgetting to put my ogre on the pitch and worst of all not adding those precious star player points that my team have earned.   This does have slightly better graphics and the UI easily better than the first version but the bugs have made me quit in frutstration and concede games on multiple occasions. The AI also has issues by making non-sensical moves, for example, when the opposite team has chance to score but doesnt, even on the last turn of the half.   Additionally the menu UI (not the game) has taken a major step backwards from the previous game.   As a huge fan I am sad to say give this a miss until either the bugs are fixed or it comes down by at least 33%. Or play the previous version.
4100	0	a	Better graphics and animation, and its nice to see the announcers now. Other than that? An entirely inferior game to the original.   There are still bugs, there are vastly less teams, there seems to be less in-match announcer dialogue, there're no team-specific cheerleaders, the slow-mo tackle animations don't need to be for 'every' tackle, tournements just 'end' without any sort of victory scene or trophy.  If/when the game gets a few major content updates, it may be worth it. Til then, stick with the original.
4101	0	a	Another attempt. I'm not sure why those involved in converting GW titles believe they need to recreate a new experience, when folks already enjoy an existing one. Unless you believe digital gamers today are that different from their traditional gamer counterparts? No.   Guy and gals - the game's been designed and tested. All we want from you is some lovely visualisation (which this title does give) and for you to use our computers to aid our play. Team managment. Customizing models/painting. Organise leagues. Customise leagues. Learn to make the computer support and expand on the existing play experience. Make it work for us.  A virtual table-top for GW fun.  Instead we get poorly implemented league management tool. Feeble customisation options. No tools to aid play, such as a grid. And a terrible camera. That cannot be rotated. Because...?  Oh and some rule/skill changes. Let's fiddle with the player costs (Orc Blizter) and the human catchers's AV (Now 8). Because the years of itterative testing and feeback are obviously not as valued as the opinions of Cyanide's so-called game designers. Good call guys/gals.  Those lovely graphics? While certainly pretty, they suffer from form over function. If you were a fan of Chaos Edition's visual graphic changes as each player levelled (for example, Chaos Warriors would get more impressive armour) then tough luck. The models don't reflect the player's level - where once you could simply look at an opponents player and get an idea of its level/power, now a rookie looks the same as legend.   And racial cheerleaders? Ha! Humans for everyone! Yes, no more race-specific cheerleaders.   Finally, you can't choose to NOT use a skill - and some skills simply work differently to the actual game rules, that this mockery is meant to be representing. I'd like to believe it was another attempt at Cyanide trying to 'improve' the game, but its mostly probably just poor implementation.   I swear to the RNGods - whenever/whoever makes a Necromunda game, if they follow the logic of Cyanide and those chumps that did Mordheim, we'll have a narrative-driven multiplayer FPS shooter....      Edit: Update the info on the grid, which was added after launch. Added additional details on changes to orc/human, inabilty to rotate camera and no option to not use a skill.  Edit 2: Orc prices changes have been reverted. It seems they realised that their in-house data may not have matched over a decade of real-world play testing and development. Camera still locked.
4102	0	a	They took a game, rereleased a prettier simple version with customisation and leveling aesthetics removed and are now selling back to you what they took out from before - equal+ to the initial cost of the game.  I had HOPED, that BB2 would end the constant rerelease of editions from the BB era. I was HAPPY to pay for the DLC races as I actually felt there was some value. Had I known there would also be microtransactions for simple player shirts and other features REMOVED from previous games, I would NEVER have bought it. Thanks Cyanide, you just made me add another game to the list of things I refuse to support. I realise the game has not sold as well as you had hoped, but if it hadn't been released halfarsed and incomplete in the first place things would have been different.
4103	0	a	This game is probably fine if you are mostly interested in playing multiplayer. However unfortunately this game revealed how much AI's struggle with situations like Blood Bowl. I played through the entire campaign and conceeded one touchdown in the entire series. Now some of this was due to the fact that the campaign gave you a TR far in excess of your opponents without give them inducements but most of it was due to the fact that the AI constitantly made stupid plays. From running their throwers away from the ball and picking it up with someone else, random one square moves and just having no understanding of how many turns were left in the half. The storyline was fun and the random events were interesting but in the end if I could get my money and time back I would.
4104	0	a	6 months, not a single additional team. ♥♥♥♥ing Joke.  Game was reasonably good out of the gate, but the Dev team really are the essence of drag your ♥♥♥♥. It's either a really small team, or a really bad one, but for a AAA price, a AAA game was not supplied. The previous versions of Bloodbowl were better. Buy one of those, if you want a complete product.
4105	0	a	Overall, unless you want to play online, I recommend folks grab the Chaos edition instead - it's got the complete teams, and other than that, the game is almost identical. The AI is somewhat improved in this version, but it's still quite poor, and rarely poses a significant challenge.  The game isn't bad, but certainly not something I'd recommend non-BB fans play at all.
4106	0	a	Lacking races and there is no single player, just a boring tutorial they call single player.
4107	0	a	I wouldn't recommend this at any price over the original.  For all it's faults BB1 beats BB2 in almost every way.  +BB2 has the shiny graphics. Sure.  -Less teams. WAY less teams. -It also has a terrible UI (even worse than BB1). -Much less stats. -No player names. -NO PLAYER NAMES !? -The camera is dreadful. You cannot plan your next move while your opponent plays as the camera keeps moving. -No scrollable log of the dice rolls. BB1 had a horrible little text log but it was scrollable at least. -League creation is a joke. BB1 had far more options when it came to creating leagues/cups.  Shocking stuff.  Super 'game' wrapped up in a stinking mess of a product.
4108	0	a	Inferior to the prior version, basically a cash grab with micro transactions thrown on top of it. Unfortunately I passed the two hour mark for a refund.  Seriously, how do you make a game worse? Hell, the same game with improved graphics would have been nice, instead we get a worse version, with paid limitations, but better looking.  Disappointed.  Graphics and animations: improved Solo gameplay: bad, campaign feels highly scripted and the AI are terrible. Multiplayer: Not sure if I'll bother.  I suppose if this was just marketed as a multiplayer experience and offered no single player, I probably would not have bought it. (which is probably why there is a 'solo campaign' *rolls eyes)
4109	0	a	Bretonnians and graphics are the only real advantages to this game over Bloodbowl Chaos Edition. You can't save and exit from a single player game, and get penalised for quitting against AI. I don't understand the people who think the UI is better: inviting people to leagues is decidely more fiddly and sometimes it is infuriating that you click on your team wanting to play with them, only to remember that you have to exit out of two menus, and then go back into a completely separate menu just to play with them. The control system is worse than the original, though you can switch it back to the other system. The cutscenes get boring and samey. There are less teams, and ironically less graphical customisation options.
4110	0	a	Chaos edition offered a much larger variety of things to the game. For a start more races, and no micro transactions. Everything worked smoother. The only real upgrade are the graphics which are not that big of deal since it is game of tactics not gameplay.   An expensive price or a mediocre game, if you want to play Blood Bowl, get Chaos Edition, the player base is still there and it you pay less for it than you would for one of the DLC's in Blood Bowl 2.  [EDIT]  So a developer actually replied to my review.   A few things i wanted got added which is nice. No DLC in 6 months though. The pricing is still too much in my opinion. Will keep this review negative for now.
4111	0	a	The control system is better than previous but the campaign is basically a tutorial and dlc is unables to be used on it which is rubbish, hopefully they remove the online only aspects allowing full control of teams for main game  23/12/2015 update  Played again after recent update, they have added an offline mode that is similar to the short games in BB1 but it is still missing the offline campaign element where you can use your dlc team if you want in it, so this game still is governed by the online side which will only last as long as there is server support which sucks, tbh there is better development and play on the Mobile game on android or apple you just have to suffer the touch screen side of things or the xbox arcarde version which is very good for playability and offline content
4112	0	a	Now with a 'Year After' review added.  What BB2 still currently lacks...is the Ability to allow Sportsmanship. Continuing to Lack the Tools for Players and Especially League Admins to fix 'issues and glitches' in order to keep things fair and right is a problem. The game STILL isn't worthy of the people who play it.  Granted it looks and sounds nice, but there are so many things wrong with this release.  Price Point. Far too high, especially in light of just how much content is missing.  DLC teams. Again Price Point much too high, Seven Ducats for EACH team is practically criminal, the first Blood Bowl is far better value for the money.  Lack of Starting Teams. Seriously? Where's even the basic Undead team? No Amazons? No Norse? The list goes on and on for just how many teams that came with the starting Board Game of Lore. Goblins? Nope. Halfings? Nope. And it goes further and further. Elf variant teams? One is DLC and the rest are missing. Chaos Dwarves? Not here. Necro or Khemri? Triple Skull.  Bugs and Stupid AI. Well the AI is still no shakes of a stick at like in the prior game, and some of the bugs are really bad. They have promised patches but these appear to be slow to follow.  Seriously, if just really need to get this one, wait for a sale at least. It is NOT worth the full price at all.  July 2016 - Is it any better after a year?  It's STILL not a recommended game at full price point. Gradually we have more teams coming out...Norse finally, and Undead e-v-e-n-t-u-a-l-l-y. But at this rate we're looking at YEARS if ever to have a full complement of teams. No Amazons on the Horizon...Goblins or Halflings? Nope...Chaos Dwarves? Not a peep, etc. There's 'whispers' of Nurgle but suspect we're looking at 2017 at this pace. I've seen Mummies shuffle down the field faster...  Glitches...oh yeah. They continue to be an issue. Play the campaign? Better not score with a player with Kick when it gives that mission to unlock (spoilers) Griff. Griff with Kick is enough to make Jim renounce his Red Wine...  Badly coded Overtime? Still there, and saw that even in the World Cup recently. Team wins a flip yet 'gets his drive picked FOR him' if he wants to be offence or defence. Seriously? Cost a World Cup game to the unfortunate coach, and yet STILL no Admin ability to 'correct and wind back the clock'. If you're going to be serious about wanting this to be a 'major multi-player supported game with leagues and tournaments' you NEED those tools in place.   The 'concept' of the game is STILL brilliant to this day. And the opponents and wonderful casters out there Sage, Fantastic, VG and all the rest keep me coming back and just enjoying myself.   Someday...this game might be worthy of the quality of people who play it. I dare to dream...
4113	0	a	It's pretty, I'll give it that. And I imagine in a year or two it will be solid. But much like BB1 was at launch Bloodbowl 2 is far from a complete game. Putting aside the fact that they don't have goblins or halflings (which is sort of a dealbreaker for me right off the bat) the lack of fullscreen (You can play borderless window at full resolution, but that overtaxes some hardware) makes it almost unplayable and little things like no armor upgrades and lack of a true solo campaign (you can play in a solo league but it is noteably less awesome than the solo campaign in 1 where there was a map and more of a sense of a world and story) make the game just lacking in gameplay compared to Chaos Edition.  So here's what it comes down to. If you're a hardcare blood bowl player and you want to support the studio so they can continue to imrpove this game and utlimately have 2 as full featured (or hopefully more) as one, then buy it. It definitely has promise and my family bought 3 copies for this reason.  If you don't already have Chaos Edition it really comes down to what's most important to you. If it's graphics then by all means, get II!  If it's gameplay... well I honestly can't bring myself to recommend II over Chaos Edition... yet. Chaos has had years to polish things and has 23 races compared to 8 here. Which is really frustrating for me because I have friends I'd like to get into BloodBowl. But since I myself will be sticking with Chaos Edition until they've added some key things like fullscreen, more races, and a better single player experience, it's pretty hard for me to recommend this over Chaos, particularly given that Chaos is cheaper.
4114	0	a	Highly recommend Blood Bowl 1. This sequel functionally adds some fun additions to the play and fixes some multiplayer annoyances. The game content is fantastic. But there's no reason to spring for the newer version. Normally I'd support the switch to a more open platform with some purchasable mods in the interest of the developers making a few honest dollars from some colorful content (along with vastly the multiplayer community.) However...   Unforgivable Sin:  Must now Purchase Formerly Free Content (Wood Elves, and Lizardmen Races)  Bad Things:  1. Much Increased Loading Times 2. Increased AI Thinking Times (The 4 minute countdown timer doesn't apply to the AI.) (On my computer about 2 minutes for anything more complex than a kickoff or the first turn after.) (Totaling to double the time for me to finish a game, although admittedly, my computer isn't so great.) 3. % of Success posted not modified by auto-reroll skills such as catch and dodge. (Essentially they're showing the odds of a single dice roll. Yay.)  Good Things:  1. In-Game Save. 2. Players have modifiable appearance. 3. Interesting Campaign 4. Modifiable Locations (Including some really fun stuff.) 5. Funnier commentary. 6. % of success posted for risky moves.  I don't resent them for trying to make money off a great game. But I bought the game for the content. Now there's additional charges for races I can play in the old version for free? Sorry. I'll play the old version. There's just not enough difference for me to care.
4115	0	a	a lot of promise, no delivery  cyanide game  7 months not enough to release 1! new race .. i guess game might be complete by 2030?  do not buy
4116	0	a	Absolutely no balance in the online play. Unless you have 12 friends that all want to start a team together good luck finding a league to start a fresh team. The matchmaking system has no ranking filter and will put you up against seasoned teams in your first match, making it not only almost impossible to win, but also not the least bit enjoyable.
4117	0	a	Here are my taughts after playing trough 90% of the campaign and trying out a bit of multiplayer.  1. If you are a player experienced with the tabletop go buy BB1 Chaos Edition instead of this unless you prefer the better looking graphics. BB1 CE is still way superior to BB2 if you want genuine gameplay.  If you are a player new to Blood Bowl it's an awesome game however I recommend you buy this game on sale since in my opinion it's just not enough bang for your buck.   Pros - Beginner friendly, Better graphics, slightly better AI Cons - Expensive in comparison to the content that you get. Being beginner friendly comes at the cost of many functions from the original game not being available (see below). Gameplay isn't optimized for PC but rather for console.  As a genunine fan of the tabletop and in general I very much enjoyed BB1 Chaos edition I must say that i am in general dissapointed with BB2. This game still feels like it is in beta 1 year after its release. There is no option but to have your skills forced upon you, there is no passing template from a potential possition etc.  Perhaps one thing that realy bugs me out is how much the adaptation for the console verision shines trough in the PC release, it makes the playing experience feel alot wonkier than BB1 Chaos Edition. Despite BB1 having its fair problems with bugs I still prefer that verision so far. Positives in BB2 are definelty graphics and so far I havent encountered as many bugs as there were in BB1. I'd also like to say that it's probably a lot more beginner friendly than BB1. There AI in singleplayer is also somewhat better.Maybe I just had to high expectations from this game since ive loved the game for more than 15 years. However at its current state I simply cannot recommend the game unless you buy it on sale.
4118	0	a	Do not buy this game. I bought it in December with the promis of the next 3 dlc races being free. It is now April and the first race was suppose to be released by the end of February. The game is lacking content, and the devs refuse to release the promised content. Skip this and pick up BloodBowl Chaos Edition if you really want to play.
4119	0	a	Let me start by saying I LOVE Bloodbowl. I really enjoyed the board game and later the first Cyanide release of the PC game.  Unfortunatley they somehow managed to epically F@#k up BB2.   The good things I will say is that they made the graphics better and more polished, and thats pretty much the end of the 'Pro's'  There are too many cons to list so I'll just name my main ones.  1. Your players look the same FOREVER, they dont get better looking gear as they level up, so your noob lineman ends up looking like a pro level 6 lineman. Those who play BB will understand how lazy and lame this missing feature is, it was in BB1.  2. They just made up some random rules, so the BB game that has been tested for 20 years apparently was no good so they just made some tweaks withouit checking with the community. BB rules are like scripture to BB players, dont mess with them.  3. You have to do about 10x more clicking than in BB1 to do your moves  4. Leagues need fixing  5. They dont listen or respond to the community on their forums  6. There are so many issues yet they hardly ever patch the game, in its current state you wouuld expect a patch a week.  I never write negative reviews (I think this is my first ever) but they really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off. I would have been over the moon with all the features of BB1 and just improved graphics (you would think that would be the minimum). Instead you get half the features of BB1 with random new rules and no updates/patches in sight. Stay away for a year or so until (hopefully) they complete the game.
4120	0	a	Better interface in Blood Bowl: Chaos Ed. Better everything. Only nice animation you will enjoy for maye 2 hours..
4121	0	a	I am very disappointed that I cant play a solo campaign with whatever race I want as in the previous editions of BB. I do hope that this feature will be possible later on.
4122	0	a	A long time fan of both the Table top and computer editions. I don't really see the niggly problems of the game, other than it isn't finished....is it? My main gripe comes with Steam putting on a sale barely 1 month after release...come on...this shows no respect for the fans who are gonna buy DLC's etc..... I was gutted to pay the full price, but did it to support the game......it's not got content for the SP to match this price tag, and MP doesn't interest me ... wait til the next markdown to buy...I am now only going to buy steam on sale..
4123	0	a	Bad interface, can not tell players apart, mismatch on TV's so you end up playing TV's stupidly higher than yours and big guys hide other players from view. stadium upgrades are utterly unfair. clipping on visuals is lazy of producers of this game. very over priced and it seems it a DLC money farming game as many races are missing . total rip off!!

4125	0	a	This game is a shame, I love Blood Bowl. I have owned the table top Blood Bowl since 1986 and have avidly played Blood Bowl Chaos edition and with the graphics, the smoothness of play and the promise of a better AI and more management tools this seemed like it would be the best thing ever. IT IS NOT.  Blood Bowl 2 is at best ready for an extended beta-release, the number of game play bugs pile up by the day and Cyanide seems to have abandoned the support forums. There is no word on any of the many,many,many too numerous to fix bugs are being worked on and there is no acknowledgement from Cyanide that anything to fix Blood Bowl 2 is happening.  Add that to the inexplicable changes to races/players, beefed up human catchers that have no cost increase, impotent Chaos Warriors and an AI that can only win if it stacks the die rolls impossibly in it's favor and this game is a sham that shouldn't even be called Blood Bowl.  Add to that Cyanides ignoring of the LRB and their seemingly pointless tinkering at minor rules and gameplay instead of focusing on fixing the numerous bugs and this game mystifies as to why it was released.  I want to love this game, but I don't and I find myself frustrated at something that could have been so good so inexplicably ruined. I think the only thing that could save this game is to take it out of Cyanides hands, they have completely lost the script.  Unless you have never played any other iteration of Blood Bowl, or if you hated the other versions do not buy this game.  UPDATE: I'm really, really trying to love this game, I've added another 22 hours of game play and if anything it is buggier last week and this week than it was before.  Unlike other players I've never had crashes, just annoying game play bugs, but now the game is 'Black Screening' about 45% of the time. You can hear the game going on and see the cursor but the screen is blank and windows shows the game as 'Not Responding' it's been happening to lots of players and the BB2 support forums have multiple multi post threads about it and SURPRISE! No input from Cyanide at all.  Game Devs: Read these reviews closely, this how you destroy a uch loved, highly anticipated game.
4126	0	a	Right now, blood bowl 2 is in a bad state. Not graphically, or in the sound department, both are pretty well fleshed out for what they are. Gameplay holds very stable, especially if you arriving from the first one. The percentages that it now displayed is unchanged from the old system Blood Bowl chaos edition did with the dice to a much easier to get d6 that was confusing to many players first starting.  The issue primarily plaguing this game is its meta. This is a very well rough spot, for its role as fantasy football. You play based on defined styles from the race you choose. Currently, one aspect of the team in question here has reached a nasty point of contention within the community. The defenders of this are going to tell you 'Play a different team.' when you encounter this team makeup. Normally, this is a fine aspect. The team in question has a means to do this, and its used to deal with certain persisting aspects of your team after the game. And losing half to three quarters of a team you spent time and energy into because of this matchup.  Death happens in this game for some teams, death happens alot more for others. But when you get roaming kill teams to face that exist to ruin your game, rather then win, is it a good thing? And that is the big problem right now to why I can't recomend this game. Cyanide is starting to give the tools to make sure you can avoid losing your team to this, but you cant avoid it fully yet. If it goes through, i'd gladly change my review to positive.   But anyhow, have a good day.  If you are reading this, then you've either crawled to where it was vote bombed down, or looking to reviews. In which case either way, thank you.
4127	0	a	Everything Blood Bowl 1 did right i.e. Customization, real time leagues, playing with a friend in leagues, ect. they ruined or just took out altogether, and everything Blood Bowl 1 did wrong they made even worse i.e. Broken dice RNG, team pros and cons not mattering at all, play styles that don't focus on the ball just lose, ect.  I would stick with the first one, it has about the same amount of players and is simply the better game. Not to mention it's cheaper.
4128	0	a	wait for the legendary chaos ninja edition...
4129	0	a	I played 70 hours with BBCE and like 100-150 hours with my non-steam BB and BBLE. So let's cut to the chase....  It is an absolute rip-off!   If you have Blood Bowl LE or CE you shouldn't buy this. They sell the same game basically the fourth time but now we don't get a proper selection for races, but we get clunky controls and playability, irritating menu and worst handling I've ever met in in a 'tabletop' game.  I go back to BBCE and will try a refund on this. I was lucky it was on sale. Shame, this game really shouldn't exist!
4130	0	a	Could be a great game... at the rate of development, it might be done in 5 years...
4131	0	a	Only visual and multiplayer improvement over the first title.Single player is almost non-existent.
4132	0	a	This is exactly Blood Bowl 1, with far fewer teams and slightly better graphics.   The only time I would recommend this over the original game is if you're a multiplayer enthusiast and want to be able to play against strangers over the internet. If this is the case, be prepared to pay a fee to enter a league and/or wait ridiculous amounts of time to find a match.  I am a big fan of Blood Bowl as a game. I am not giving this a recommendation because the first version of this game is cheaper and has 3x as many options for teams with no changes to gameplay.
4133	0	a	I gave this game a fair go, really. I understand it's a dice game, I understand its random. However today this happened.   My LVL6 Witch Elf, with sure footed, on elf turf to mitigate injury, died while going for it. Yes I had 2 Apothecaries because I was playing against Dwarves, however.  Before I had the chance to use the Apoth the game crashed. Because this game is an unfinished pile of trash (and that's being kind). You still can't, in twenty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ fifteen, log back into a match after disconnect. So I have uninstalled and will never play a BB game again.   Even ignoring this situation, the game has a plethora of other problems, bugs, compatibility issues, connection stability etc.  Currently as of the time of this review only 1200 (as if that isnt already an indication not to buy) people are playing BB2 at peak time. I dont play at peak time, neither does the majority of the planet. I'm forced to play EURO and US players from SEA and wait 20-30 per movement while the server catches up. Also if this causes a DC, you cant get back into your match. That is unacceptable.   I'm not even going to get into gameplay and balance. Suffice to say all you need to do is check every single league leader board and see undefeated Chaos and Lizardmen on every one. Most of their victory's come from concedes by the way (you can check). Since nobody wants to struggle keeping players alive rather than playing the damn game. The perma death and injury system has driven away the entire player base.   I enjoy an amount of randomness in my gaming, it is exciting. However this game is over the top. The amount of chance involved takes away all notion of a skilled player having an effect on the outcome of a game. You always do the most sensible stuff possible to succeed and still get ♥♥♥♥ed over by rolls.   IF this game were more along the lines of X-Com, where a skilled player can have an actual impact on keeping important pieces alive, then I would continue playing. This game does not give you that chance. Your best players can die from the most simple and likely to succeed action. That is ridiculous and makes this game feel more like a chore than anything else.  All that is left here are the bash team trolls. 'Can't think so we just hurt stuff.'   See ya never.
4134	0	a	[Updated oct. 2016]  UPDATE: I find myself going back to the game once in a while, when I'm not in the mood for anything too demanding, and I found it was time to update this... Because... I've given up now. Can't deal with my issue 4 (below) not being dealt with. Just totally inexcusable in my book.  Still disappointed. Love Games Workshop worlds and games. Really liked the updated graphics, but the interface is the first disappointment... It's NOT intutive. I think it's fine with some experimenting or letting people choose other setups, but you shouldn't be forced to 'learn' their new setup. UPDATE: I've gotten used to the interface, still not sold on it.    Single player campaign is... very stretched out... and too short... How is that possible? Well it introduces one rule per game pretty much, which means that to players who know Blood Bowl you're basically playing one extremely long tutorial. And then short; because after the campaign itself you can only make single player leagues. No progression or different tournaments as in the first Blood Bowl.  Then the REALLY big letdowns: 1. 6 or so races? WHAT? And extra races at around 1/6 of the full price game per race is just outrageous?! When I found this out, I tried to get my money back, but you can only do that after playing a max of 2 hrs... So having played a bit more, well... UPDATE: More races are comming and free for all now... Ok... Should have been this way all along...  2. Extremely counterintuitive setup of leagues. Why is there only one way to do everything. I mean... It's horribly set up. Really. Never seen a setup I had such a hard time figuring out how to get through. UPDATE: You'll get used to it, but still... really annoying interface :-)  3. WHY can't you set up more than one player managed team in an offline league with computer teams. A lot of players asked for this as an update to the first game and they didn't introduce it in this sequel. UPDATE: STILL missing. Biggest letdown along with the next one!  UPDATE: 4. No saves in single player during a match... You HAVE to finish an entire game in one session. No save at half time. I honestly didn't write about this in my first review, because I was sure it would be implemented in one of the first updates. So if you're not single... forget it. This game is not for you... Kids. You need to get rid of them if you want to play...  The choice must be because 'they' don't want people to hack save files, but... jeeeez. This only affects those that do not cheat. Cheaters will cheat. Those who have a life, can't play... Thanks a lot...   In summary: Don't buy unless you are single, have no job, and don't mind starting the same match several times...  So disappointed...

4136	0	a	As a long time player of tabletop games related to this genre, I was drawn into this game by some fun videos on YouTube.  I wish the general community was as fun as the people who play on YouTube...  Pros - GW has a real knack for a sort of gallows humor and tongue in cheek style that somehow manages to be both dark and silly at the same time. It lends itself well to games that actually grew out of war simulations. The two narrators are entertaining, as GW characters are wont to be, and Cyanide I feel did a wonderful job capturing the flavor of the game.  Cons -   1. The UI is clunky. There is no entirely safe way to plan your moves. Misclicks result in anything from having to start all over to having your player throw the ball across the field when you did not intend it.   2. The teams are not particularly well balanced. This goes back to it being a GW game. GW, for those of you now aware, stands for Games Workshop. This is a company that just abandoned a decades old wargame franchise seemingly specifically to spite a sector of their customer base they apparently considered harmful for their sales.   We'll see how that works out. Meantime, Blood Bowl 2 sports a handful of the teams available in the semi-official (I.E. not at all supported by GW for decades now) tabletop rules. Skaven are all but unplayable. Chaos seem to rule the leagues based on the fact that they have access to an entirely separate set of upgrades that other races can only rarely access (mutations). Skaven can get them fairly easily too, but Skaven die in higher levels in truckloads with an armor value of 7 even on front line players. As the game rewards survival of multiple games heavily, Skaven and other low armor, high finesse teams find it hard to compete at higher levels of play. At least one private league now invites ONLY finesse teams into its league to avoid the devestation the high armor and high strength teams visit on their weaker cousins.   There is no cure for this imbalance in sight. My experience with GW - players and designers alike - is that making the game balanced and competative is not really high on their list of things to do. Wonder if Cyanide can break that trend? So far, the answer is no.  3. The graphics are pathetic. This game offered little in the way of graphics to begin with. It is a standard sort of top down view with very clunky camera control. But to make matters worse, players move about stiffly, often ending up somewhere other than where you aimed them only to slip into place like a loose block, and the handful of full screen animations that pop up typically sport part of one player poking through the other player because of bad positioning of the camera and/or models during the animation render.  At one point the game reversed the team uniforms between my Skaven and the opposing Skaven team...?  In short, just old fashioned sloppy graphics and animation work.   4. The community is not nearly as friendly as the YouTube videos that seem to be the main marketing arm for the game would lead you to think.   Summary: Nice idea, but the execution is predictably pathetic as GW tends to just pawn its IP off to whoever is willing to fork over the money and let the chips fall where they may. There has never in the history of GW been anything remotely resembling quality control as far as their game rules go. They make wonderful miniatures and great game fluff, but horribly horrible games. And their company is quite obviously struggling because of it.  In any event, I would definitely not recommend this game. The lack of balance between the teams and the clunky UI have left me entirely uninterested in continuing play, and like so many GW fans, the player base seems to be a bunch of rabid dogs whose main function in life is to convince people to play games with them by treating them like crap and pretending there's nothing wrong with the game's design or execution.   Caveat - There are those who accuse me of being 'Sausage fingered'. I seem to do well enough in pretty much every other video game I play though. I'm pretty sure this is just the typical GW fanboy reaction to anything negative you ever say about their games, but in the interest of fairness, there are apparently people who just LOVE the UI. I can't imagine why, and they are none too communicative as to WHY they think the UI rocks, but there you have it.   Maybe my fingers turn to sausages specifically for GW games.
4137	0	a	I got the game and i loved it (only got to for a few hours), however, now the game is simply unplayable on my laptop.  this is due to not being able to change the resolution settings and save because for some reason, the lower my mouse goes on the screen, the further out of calibration the pointer in the game becomes and i can no longer click on things such as the save button in the options menu to change the resolution to even fit my screen. (also the only program i experience this with)  I really want to play more of this game.....if my issues are dealt with in future patches, no complaints.
4138	0	a	I was pretty upset there was no offline/hotseat leagues. And there was quite the lack of creativity available for league customization despite them talking it up. I pre-ordered, then refunded the game and just bought it for xbox one, which now I have to convince my friends to buy it to play a a league.... it's pretty sad, but thats kinda what I expected after the first blood bowl. As long as you don't mind losing the pretty art etc, you can just play Fummbl online for free. (it even has a hotseat league mode) but you will need to know the rules to bloodbowl for things like leveling etc.
4139	0	a	The game, while tactically very fun, is slow; opponent AI turns take between 1 and 2.5 minutes; end result is that I find something else to do while my (AI) opponent takes its turn.  But that doesn't make it a bad game, it just makes it a slow game. The negative recommendation is related to saving.  1. You cannot save in the middle of a match. Period. Combine that with the aforementioned slowness of the game (call it 4 minute rounds, and 16 rounds in a match), and you're looking at losing up to an hour of gameplay if you have to leave before the end. 2. Having just played an aforementioned hour-long match (which I enjoyed very much!), the game simply did not record the progress. I was taken back to the Solo League screen, with the same opponent I had just played, and none of the gained stats.  Such a simple concept should not be simply not allowed (saving a game), nor should it straight up fail to save progress in the rare instance that your progress is recorded. That's pretty silly.
4140	0	a	After playing an Old World League Season, having a human team that managed to survive the never fail blocking, dodging and picking up of the AI, with only 2 losses and 3 deaths, my first game in the post season is against a Dark Elf team that supposedly won 9 games yet still has a fan factor of Zero and has 5 linemen with Guard (strength skills that they require a double on level up to get), and three other stat adjustments in the roster. My Ogre got a double and has block , I have a lineman with strength 4 and only two of my blitzers have guard.  There is something seriously wrong with the level assignments of the AI teams and the always Zero Fan Factor means that supposed parity of the teams is achieved by giving the AI more skills and stat rolls to achieve a closer team rating which completely unbalances the game as they recieve up to 100 points in team rating and stats as against your up to 10 points of fan factor which gives you nothing.
4141	0	a	This game needs serious work. The whole system is flawed. There is nothing intuitive about it. Playing the game is cumbersome and, for the most part, boring. The selection of teams is confusing. The inablility to see what your players do makes them useless. This is not worth spending your money on for at least two patches. A bit it sucks is not sufficient enough to describe it.
4142	0	a	I, like many, was looking forward to the release of BB 2 for a long time. I didn't care about the marketing strategies being used with DLC/teams etc, thats just how games are sold these days, it sucks but uunless we all stop buying nothing will change. Anyway the game came out and i started playing and just felt deflated.....don't get me wrong, it looks great, the animations are fun (you'll turn them off after a few games!), the AI seems improved, the campaign is awful, so everything i expected from BB2. Thats the problem though, its exactly how i thought it would be, its just BB in video game form, nothing new or exciting, the continuing lack of 'random events' and 'dirty tricks' continues to frustrate! Within a few hours i just got bored......would i recommend the game, yes if you like BB you'll like this, but otherwise.....
4143	0	a	The following are the ONLY two features that aren't a step back from Chaos or Legendary edition:   - Direct steam invites for multiplayer  - Better graphics   That's it. EVERYTHING else is a big step back from Chaos &amp; Legendary. Tons of little things from the interface to the feedback to the camera that really start adding up (especially the announcers, holy crap did they become unfunny in this version).  But most of all, the roster is a joke. A grand total of 8 races compared to the 20+ you get out of the box with the cheaper previousi games. New races are slowly being added...as DLC for $6 a pop. Maybe after 2 more years and $150 this game will be as good as Blood Bowl 1 is right now for $10?
4144	0	a	Well as a huge fan of of the original game it saddens me to not be able to reccomend BB2.  Pros:  Graphically much improved from the first game. Entertaining dialogues in the career mode even if it is over in a blink.  Cons: Game is hard for the wrong reasons. The first one was hard because you were taking a bloody 900 rated team and bashing it into a 1200 rated team. This game is hard because you take your 1400 rated team and play a 1000 rated team and you watch as every.single. roll. goes thier way. I'm all for RNG and it adds a lot of complexity to the gameplay but whatever bonus there is to the ai rolls is absolutely infuriating at times. Its annoying to watch as your player gets tripped twice and you waste a re-roll, and then have the ai Magically move 6 players with no problem with a 33% chance or lower each move. To me this kills the original base for playing the game. Whats the point of spending time strategizing how to protect the carrier when the 1 opponant who magically gets by the 4 defenders ko's him and when i have the ai carrier completely surrounded, lone behold its like 50/50 if he actually goes down. There is an astounding lack of content for the price. Customization is at an all time low. Individual player customizations are only a handful and team customization is almost non existent. What could be considered 'customization' is procedural stadium upgrades and additional dlc.   If this title was 15$ I would say yeah give it a go, but as it's currently priced its a massive dissapointment.   Some Ideas that would make me feel like I actually spent my money well. 1. This game has a huge cult following.Open up the game to the steam workshop and let the players help you create the customizable content for the teams,players, and stadiums. Heck even have them be able to create entire teams and leagues as playing versus generated bot teams without a real world impact feel is something thats seriously missing from the first. 2. If you do the above, run daily leagues that provide a chest or package depending on your final position that gives you epic loots to customize your teams/players
4145	0	a	Step 1. Make Chaos Team. Step 2. Take Claws and MB on ever player Step 3. Take Pilling on on a few players Step 4. WINNER  3 out of 4 team you will play against are the above. All they are after is to kill your team and they only win when you Concede to them because you dont want your team destoryed.  Dont waste your Money and Time with this game. Unless you are following the above.
4146	0	a	The game isn't BAD. But it's not Blood Bowl. Not in the shape that Blood Bowl players of decades know as Blood Bowl. Cyanide has made their own little uneccesary changes, because they know better than the rest of us. Thus creating a Blood Bowl that is gorgeous to look at, but it's not the Blood Bowl most players recognize. Not only have they done this, but they've done this without ever ONCE trying to explain WHY they do these things. Nor do they offer the ordinary fan an option to play with the standard rules of the game.  So.. I regret having given my money to Cyanide for this 'almost but not quite BB' game.
4147	0	a	This is my first time ever reviewing a game. Like previous posters have stated the dice rolls are completly in favor to the AI in the game. So bad to a point I could almost tell what my dice rolls were going to be. I understand the dev control difficulty level in this game by controlling the dice rolls, but my gosh this is bad. Be prepared to rage quit many many times while playing this game.
4148	0	a	I do not recommend this game at all in its current condition. Where to start... Firstly the game is missing 14 teams compared to blood bowl chaos edition. 14 teams! That is more than half. There are multiple bugs. The developers have no idea what giving updates to the blood bowl community is, they are pretty much radio silent always! MatchMaking is unbalanced and the only teams you come across are Dwarf, Chaos and Orc (all Bashy teams). They is a campaign but nothing compared to blood bowl chaos edition where you got to manage a team from the start and progress them through many competitions till you finally got to the blood bowl! There are alot of minor issues that dont effect the gameplay but are still noticeable... like the fact i cant rotate the camera all he way around the pitch or that the only races that watch blood bowl are human peasants who all bought there outfit from the same store, and orcs who like to beat the life out of that drum! Until alot more content is added, being different teams, a proper campaign, more league options and bug fixes then i would avoid. The only improvement is the way the game looks.
4149	0	a	what I have played of it i don't like it as much as I did the first one.
4150	0	a	Currently have a team with 4 boguth re-rolls. In a match they only have 1 re-roll available. Just one of many bugs.
4151	0	a	Can you fix the game so i can play in full screen else i want my money back and will send you hate mail every day until it is fixed!!!!!  This is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t!!!
4152	0	a	Crash'tastic, get the original it works!
4153	0	a	Cyanide is the developper. Took about 12 expansions for the first blood bowl to make a good game. Will need about the same for this one. Cyanide, release unfinished and buggy content and they almost never communicate. All in all they are very semi competent about what they do. The ONLY reason this game is semi popular is because its bloodbowl. ANY other generic IP or theme and this game would (and the first one) be a flop.
4154	0	a	crash after crash in solo campaign  requesting graphic driver updates, cant get any later drivers than whats avaliable right now only play one race in the offline in campaign no tournament offline  online works fine, except for players conceding on the smallest injury so many games lasting 5 mins but take 10 times longer to wait for another to begin  bloodbowl1 is so much more for so much less.
4155	0	a	  Great, fun game with a lot of customization and variety in terms of players and teams.  So why is it not recommended? Because from experience it's Bethesda levels of glitchiness and whilst Bethesda generally has the courtesy to fix bugs and glitches post-release, Cyanide has neglected to fix the 'black screen' crash where the game after running perfectly on a relatively old but powerful machine (i5 3570, 8GB RAM, GTX 670 can run Witcher 3, ArmA 3, Overwatch, Fallout 4 etc. on high settings very well) crashes to black yet you could still hear the game going on yet you cannot interact with the game. Whilst this is not an issue in most games, due to a lack of a midgame save feature for singleplayer and bot matches this results in you losing the progress you've made in the game AND the experience points (or in Blood Bowl terms SPP) you've accumulated throughout the match. This is incredibly frustrating and is not helped by the fact that Blood Bowl is a game based around dice rolls meaning that you may not get those rightfully earned experience points again during the rematch.   Also noted is that against the bots, the bot's AI timer sometimes gets stuck on 0:00 meaning that the game is unable to progress as there is no way to force the bot to end their turn. Again it may not sound like a big deal but imagine playing a game of chess where after 30 minutes (and still waiting), your opponent hasn't made their turn and it just so happens that you were winning that game. Sounds frustrating? That's Blood Bowl 2 for you and it's unexcusable. All of these problems have been well documented by the community and reported on the forums yet these bugs remain unfixed despite over a years worth of bug reports. As it stands, as great of a game as Blood Bowl 2 is. I cannot recommend it due to its bugginess being on the same level of Bethesda's games at launch, and this is a turn based strategy game and not an open world RPG.  tl;dr game is buggy as hell, fix up your game Cyanide  EDIT: As of the 26th of December, even after using unofficial community methods of 'fixing' the game such as  http://forum.bloodbowl-game.com/viewtopic.php?f=90&amp;t=8004  or deleting config files as well as official methods of fixing the game such as updating drivers. The game still black screen crashes frequently. Again using Fallout 4 as a benchmark since it is a game that is widely known for stability issues. My experience with Bethesda's open world RPG was not as crash happy as Blood Bowl 2 (which is a turn based strategy game) and that was after I loaded the game with a lot of unofficial mods which affected the stability and performance of the game.
4156	0	a	I love this game bought it on the ps4 and on PC if you know what bloodbowl is then its the best version of the popular board game. However as much as i like to play this game its based on an online community which is difficult to join. It has no lobby to chat to organise games which is so important for this game, even on the ps4 the community opened its own chat room to organize games. They have in effect ruined their own game by removing this function their previous game had. To add to this i often find myself waiting for 10 mins plus for a game only to find myself giving up looking!
4157	0	a	I love blood bowl but sadly this is not worth it at the moment. Play the first game, much more content.
4158	0	a	I absolutely cannot reccomend this game when it costs nearly 50 bucks while the original is far better and has F-A-R more content at well under 1/4 of the price.
4159	0	a	Fun game with stability issues  While the game is very entertaining, and a big improvement over the previous verison, sadly it is extremely unstable. I have finished the last match of the campaign 4 times now, and every time it crashed during a cut scene. Sometimes the game just becomes so slow it is unusable - only restarting the game solves this. Saving games is hit and miss, sometimes it works, some times you have to start again. And sometimes it randomly crashes. This is with recent game and video drivers, and on supported OS and hardware.  I would recommend not getting the game now, but wait till they fix these problems.
4160	0	a	Graphics issues endure until today. Whenever I write about it in an AMA or tech forum, it gets deleted. I imagine this review will get deleted as well. Extremely disappointing game. Unfinished.
4161	0	a	I played the Blood Bowl board game a long time ago with my friends, and we had a lot of fun. Because of that I later bought and played Chaos League from Cyanide and enjoyed it.  The A.I. was really bad but in multiplayer matches the game was a blast.  You could switch between RTS and TBS, and the commentators where funny and a novelty for me. When BB2 came out, a friend besieged me to get it and play with him. In the end he gifted me this game when it was on sale.  Before that I mostly bought and played videogames in stores or online on GOG and so I had to reactivate my steam account, which was 5 years dormant (I initally wanted to play Dark Messiah in multiplayer back then). I downloaded steam and reluctantly had to accept the terrible eula and allow intrusive data collection to be able to play BB2 in multiplayer. The Blood Bowl Board Game is good. Maybe be the best and most fun system GW ever brought out, and luckily they abandoned it for a time so there is a great GW-independent community which kept the board game alive and some of them played the digital blood bowl 1 and jumped on blood bowl 2 when it came out. The BB2 videogame however is not that great.  The Sound is good and the commentators, one of the trademarks of cyanide sports games I suppose, are ok(they soon become a little repetitive). Music is pretty much forgetable on the rare occasions it comes into play.  The graphics are, compared to modern standards, mediocre at best. The 3D models in your team have variable heads but for some races not enough to avoid clones in your team. Speaking of clones, it seems the spectators in the stadium all come from the clone-factory on Kamino, ... recently I spotted some ork drummers in the audience, which could mean we arrived at two models? Yeah? Same with the  cheerleaders...why?  Animations are a bit clunky and there are a few glitches when models interact. The game-menus where you manage your teams and play in leagues are just awful and counter-intuitive. I would think, since the rules pre-existed, the developers only had to adopt those without the need to create a game concept from zero and could focus on the polish. They failed in most part imo. The programming is worse than in all low-budget indie-games I encountered. The dynamic camera gets stuck very often in animation scenes (if you havn´t turned them off) so the game continues elswhere without you seeing what is happening. The randomization routines feel off the charts, and seem inplausible after (superfical) testing.  There is a single-player campaign, meant perhaps as a tutorial(?), which is grotesquely awful in all aspects: bad tutorial, bad storytelling, no fun. Another negative aspect of the game: From the time of purchase you get all supsequent released races, but pre-Release they cut the playable races down to eight, to sell the single races later for 6.99€ if you don´t buy the game early (for 45€ without discounts). The undelying game mecanics are good as is the community for the most part (both no achievements from cyanide). The execution of the game is sloppy if you phrase it mildly, a piece of stinking s*** if you phrase it harshly. Since further support of cyanides BB1 will be abandoned there are not that many alternatives if you want to play blood bowl in online matches, though I suppose you could build a online 2D board, adapt the rules and cnace dice better than cyanide and play with icons and the numbers and have fun, or you could pick up the board game with your local community, though GW threatens to reprint BB which could mean no offical tournaments outside of GW-Shops anymore and no custom-miniatures in your team which are not from the overpriced GW-catalogue *sigh*. If you are a die-hard blood bowl fan you probably already own this game if you are interested in getting into it, I cannot recommend to buy it at its full price. Considering the overall quality of the product with all the effort the developers did not put into the game 44,99€ for the core game and 6.99€ for an additional race you want to play is rediculous. If you cannot relinquish, wait for a sale &lt;15€ or let your hardcore blood-bowl-fan friend gift it to you.  Edit 29.12.2016 (After playing some more): So, I continued playing since I signed on to a german league, and ... I had fun most of the time. But... there is still so much to improve and the possibility that the review will become a positive one. Why not yet? Aside from the still existing clone armys in many teams (My 7 dwarf lineman have only 5 different heads to choose from), in the spectators (every one has the same head) and the cheerleaders (only one human model, always blue) there are still many bugs some a nuisance and some really game breaking. The zoom out after many actions does not work properly so the game continues whithout you seeing it because the camera is pinned to a tiny spot on the field. The worst thing happening was accidentally signing off instead off quiting the game after playing and not remembering your password. There is a password retrival button but nothing happens after confirming my e-mail. nothing send, not even in the spam. Why isnt there an automated function implemented? In the forums many other players expierienced this. The support at focus-home did answer my direct email, requesting to give them a new password. Now I´m waiting that it will be set. I will continue following the game and it might still be possible that coming improvments will tipp the balance to an all around positive expierience.
4162	0	a	This could be a really enjoyable game. Great concept, great artwork, interesting and fun gameplay with dynamic characteristics. But once again, sigh, we have a developer releasing a buggy game before it's ready, rife with widespread graphics issues and reproducable errors.  So what to do? Honor your customers' investment and release a patch? No, instead the 'solution' is blaming end-users and suggesting upgrading graphics card drivers, rather than fixing the problems.   A potentionally great game ruined by poor attention to details, lack of oversight and quality-contorl.
4163	0	a	This game is being left for dead, back to the old ways again.   I really, really want to LOVE this game.. and I think that goes for everyone else who's a long time BB fan. But it seems the developers/publishers are doing the best they can to make us all disappointed. It could be so damn great, but alas, always coming up very short.   Bucket list: - No armour upgrades (building your team is a big deal, you want to love your team!) - Some player animations look re-used from BB1 - All teams should have their own stadiums.  - No hall of fame screen for past or dead players - they just retire and never be seen again - Team UI screens is horrible, lacking stats, looks thrown together by a developer. - Cheerleaders are the same for everyone - Lacking in team logos/team colors (why can’t we pick some colors, add a logo perhaps, more customization) - Blood bowl is all about customization.. add as much of this as possible! silly hats, extra weapons, team colors/home ground advantages.. - Does not feel like a complete game without goblins and halflings. - Adding pitch hazards to your games like the broken helicopter in the campaign - dev’s excuses are not great, I think that after 2+ years of development this game would be so much further down the line.  If another developer had made this game, I would imagine that at launch the customization for teams and players would be huge. Almost too much! You want to own the team and make it yours, not just another chaos team with black color like everyone else..
4164	0	a	hmmmmmm... got some problems, seems to be re-accuring in the BB games and the reason i stopped playing the last game. just played a custom league against npc coaches, lotsa fun, some tough games in a knockout but then i get to the final, had 2 nights of great fun up to now.... i fail every role, my team gets knocked down every turn, i had 3 injurys by turn 2 and my best blitzer dead and 2 other players KO'd in the next turn, even after re-rolling the death it came up death, now if youve not played the BB table table game then this might seem resonable but if you have then you would know that in order to get a death twice in a row thats like 6 6's on a D6 in a row, oh and busting there armour twice, yes that can happen but in a game where i loose every role it seems weird. also i spent 3 turns atempting to pickup a ball, in fair weather , with an agi 4 player with safe hands and he shook the ball around like a tool before being flattened and the npc scoring.  Now this used to happen all the time in BB1 because it was a cheap to make game and i was hoping that the difficulty level in BB2 would be defined by coach skill and player abilities not by the blatant and almost obvious dice swindling. several of my mates have flat refused to buy this game because they knew it would be this way. Dont really care about the price, the lack of teams, the medicore UI but really, this level of shoddy development is just poor.  I really wish i could get my money back for this game and am currently trying. if this was your problem with the first game then DO NOT BUY THIS GAME

4166	0	a	There is absolutely 0 reason to buy this right now. Chaos Edition has all the races and features, while this has HD grass that will make your computer lag. There is NO DIFFERENCE between the games themselves outside of cosmetic and stupid ♥♥♥♥ because at the end of the day the tabletop Blood Bowl rules are what they are, and that's what you are craving to play. You aren't craving HD graphics or all this fluff... Oh and the races that are in the game are the most generic ones, but to each their own I guess. Just know as far as actual features that relate to the actual game of Blood Bowl go, this is a complete downgrade and the price tag is a JOKE considering what you'll have to pay to get the rest of the races.   If you buy this now, you will have to buy every expansion they will milk over the next few years... And in 2017 you will have paid a stupid amount to get what you could've had in 2013 for significantly less $$... Of course without the features you were dying to see such as: the camera annoyingly zooming in for no reason, the UI being worse, the players themselves looking just as wonky as they did with the old graphics, the game being significantly slower...   Go directly to the Blood Bowl: Chaos edition page and purchase. The only actual downside is this game obviously has a lot more people playing online, but still I really only have to wait 3 minutes max to find an opponent on Chaos edition
4167	0	a	'Not Responding' The Game.  After spending an hour messing with launch settings, and having followed all of the relevant FAQ troubleshooting advice, I gave up.
4168	0	a	TL:DR - Compares poorly against Chaos edition of BB1  Pros - It looks better than the older version - Online play is alittle bit more stable now compared to the launch of the game  Cons - Lack of teams that are slowly being filled with paid DLC - Single player mode is hollow and pointless compared to BB1. This is the biggest miss. - The UI is buggy and poorly thought out - Sometimes your player will randomly throw the ball, sometimes it won't register clicks and other times it will do random things in game. It's incredibly frustating in a game with a small margin for error. - The animations getting a bit dull after a while - A few random crashes  I was hoping after coming back to this again after a few months they'd have fixed the problems, but after playing one game I've noted they certainly haven't....   Would only be worth it on a very good sale (or when the chaos edition equivalent comes out with all the teams included)
4169	0	a	This game is a joke, wanna play with your controller? To bad, wont recognize it or let ya change the settings. The one and only reason i bought this was so i could sit back on the couch and play but wont let me. Think ill just stick with chaos edition lest they are not making me pay for evey fricking race.
4170	0	a	I loved this game but with DLC coming no where in the near future and a nonexsist communication from the devs this game has really gone down hill. With no new content for the past 6 months the game gets stale very quickly. I would wait if you are thinking about buying this game until the devs show a little more commitment to their product...
4171	0	a	Same deal as the first version of Blood Bowl 1, missing a bunch of features but still a fun game.   Tl;dr Do not buy it &gt;&gt;&gt;YET&lt;&lt;&lt; unless you're a diehard bloodbowl fan. It is completely unfinished and as buggy as the first iteration of Blood Bowl PC, and is a straight downgrade from chaos edition in a lot of ways aside from # of teams. That being said, it will almost certainly be improved a lot in the long-run, just as Blood Bowl 1 was, so if you don't buy it now get it after a few patches for sure, in a sale. It's just a shame they seem to have not learnt much from BB1.   The Bad:  - The league system has been downgraded heavily in choice of options for organizers in almost every way possible, there's no excuse for ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on the only thing that keeps people playing your game. - Very buggy/some mechanics and skills just flat out do not function as intended (almost as bad as the first game). - No grid still - Hella expensive - 8 teams and it's hella expensive for 8 teams, they're also very vanilla teams, none of the fun/abnormal ones. - No aesthetic change on player level up anymore - Chance of some dodgy things with Cyans (their in-game currency) - Wave goodbye to cool and varied pitches. - Game is literally unfinished, still no team specific cheerleaders, only two models in the crowd etc.  - Can't view opponents team during inducements anymore. - Mouse click functions are reversed from the first game. Maddening.  The Good - Good quality spectating, probably the absolute biggest upgrade. - Bob and Jim are back, kinda. - More new player/idiot friendly. It displays the end % chances for actions as well as the dice. - It is prettier. - The proposed DLC model for teams is better than expansions and offers far better choice (imo). - Better UI (I hesitate to put this here, since the UI is def better in design, but they removed so many features from it to simplify it). - Dark Elves look ridiculously more fruity. - It's still Bloodbowl, and there's no substitute bug yet. - Possiblity of some neat things with Cyans. - You can access the options mid-match - Lots of small quality of life changes. - Praise the sun memes.
4172	0	a	I sure would like this game if my game breaking crashes weren't a consistent and pervasive problem or if they'd ever been addressed by the devs.
4173	0	a	I have 3 Bloodbowl games in my Steam Library. I bought BB II, thinking they finally added all the goodies that Chaos edition lacked. But alas. The game play is unbalanced, slow and sluggish. The new player cards they use make it harder to manage and view your team than the old list, the market to buy and sell players does not work. There is no usable community hub in game to challenge other coaches or chat about a match afterwrads.   All the teams from the Chaos editon are missing, and the player vs AI mode is lame compared to older versions. I feel like I got completely ripped off buying this game and I am super angery at the dev's for marketing this pos. I love Bloodbowl, this game could be so, oh so awesome, but it's not. It sucks to play, load, communicate, do basic anything, you can't even view a full picture of your entire team. Its just plain stupid and annoying.  
4174	0	a	So, even tough the review is marked as negative it's not gonna be a rant on the game. The game, even tough it's far from complete, is fine. Let's do a quick pros and cons before the analysis:  PROS - The game is as we always knew it, no big changes in the rules or anything - No blitz mode - Visuals are nice (even tough they are not last gen nice) - The cabalvision thing is well implemented and funny - Stadiums are awesome - Races are released at a good pace  CONS - The pricing model is aweful - Very few team and players customization (major con to me) - LOTS of leavers online for no real reason - Developers really don't seems to listen to the community - Major Races haven't even been announced (Khemri, Goblins, Vampire Counts) - There's a in-game currency, but you can't do much with it aside buying team colours - Overall feels incomplete  That pretty much sums it all up. I've been playing BB since the first game came out, and always had a blast with it. The reason why I'm giving it a bad review is because, at full price, right now it's not worth the money. I just got it on the 66% sale and so far I'm happy with it, and I also got the Lizardmen DLC (always been a fan of them), but at full price plus a 7 bucks DLC? No way man. They made some improvements from the last one like the 45 degrees camera angle, the HUD being flashier and telling you the dices results, some thing are still kinda the same (like the AI, like seriously? They said getting a better AI was one of their main focuses and it's still the same crap), and some are worse, mainly the Players not getting new gear as they level up, the Season mode il less captivating, and the AI still ♥♥♥♥s your dice throws pretty clearly. Overall I'd say: if you are a long time BB fan and you've played the past games, wait for a good sale and get this; if you never played BB and you don't care much about graphics get Chaos Edition
4175	0	a	I love Blood Bowl, but I cannot recommend this game in good conscience.  It is a dumbed down, stripped to the bones version of BB1 with a lot of fluff and glitter.  Good: - Nice presentation - Nice commentary  Bad: - Ridiculous excuse of a single player campaign. To me this is a multiplayer-only game with a fake-pretend single player mode - Why not include all races from the Chaos Edition? Of right, DLC. Shame on you for trying - AI still dice cheats. Improve AI and you do not need this drek.  All in all a perfect example that presentation is not everything. Buy BB1 Chaos Edition.

4177	0	a	This game is so messed up, I don´t even know where to start... While the first Blood Bowl was at least made with some appreciation of the Boardgame, this version is missing any depth, detail and content. The campaign is to introduce you into the rules and the game, a tutorial. Nothing more. The Solo leagues are boring as hell. In BB1 you had a nice map with different places and you needed to achieve stuff to play the next tournament. Level up your players and buy them equippment. This one here? Nothing. Just a roster.  All of this could be ignored if the basic game would be at least bug free. At this state right now, the game could still be a beta. On top of that, its a really bad console port. Just click into the graphics options and you will see it. Not even an option to go full screen or windowed.  I will get my refund via Steam and leave this dissapointment behind.
4178	0	a	Too many negatives, and just not enough positives.  Negatives:  * So few models, fans all human, cheerleaders all human, etc...   * Only player faces can be changed (and there is like 3 per type).  * Saving setups is useless, the players are not placed in same positions.  * Woeful AI (it still can't pass the ball using passing teams).  * Dice stacking, always in favour of the AI to ensure that it remains even moderately competitive.  * Performance, at best substandard, but its clearly very poorly optimised.  * Campaign, utterly terrible, the fact its only humans, even worse.  * AI leagues very limited.  * Game centred solely around multi player  * No additional features (new skills, expanded skills, skills or skill sets made more balanced).  * etc...  Positives  * None really. I feel ripped off in every way.
4179	0	a	OK, so the premise for BB2 is pretty simple. You have a great, tested and proven game system to translate into a decent UX/UI experience and add some 3D fluff to. And while BB2 looks nice, the interface is clumsy, the gameplay a bit unelegant and there's little bugs everywhere that ruin the experience;  - Why does the AI keep taking down random players rather than defending? - Why does the game sometimes fail to recognise a player standing in the end zone for a TD? - Why is it so frustrating trying to work out how to buy team assets the first time one plays?  It's a pretty bad rendition of BB guys, sry. Not recommended.
4180	0	a	 Take a chance elsewhere.
4181	0	a	This game has potential but there are a lot of missing or broken features, game breaking bugs, a poor UI both in game and out of game, no chat lobby, virtually non-existent league management, no player customization when they level up which means your stars look just like your rookies, no player statistics, just 3 Star Players available for each race instead of 6 for each race, and there are currently only 8 teams available instead of the full 23-25 races it should include and those additional races will be DLC that must be purchased if you want them. It is really shocking how incompetent Cyanide/Focus are at adapting a board game. Some of their balance changes like increasing the Orc Blitzer cost to 90k are also ridiculous and completely unnecessary.  Essentially this game is a vastly inferior product to Blood Bowl; Chaos Edition the previous version of the game which has 23 races and more features. How Cyanide released BB2 with so many critical features of the game completely missing is incredible.  Check back in 6-9 months when more teams are available and see if they've added a lot of the features they should have had in game on release day. The game will probably be on a 75% off sale by then and might be worth buying at that point.  Edited Oct 7: Cyanide/Focus just held an AMA on Reddit and unfortunately they validated the worst fears of those who were skeptical of Cyanide/Focus. Most of the missing features are not coming due to cost restraints or in some cases conscious design decisions and the same is true for many of the broken features. It's absurd but they claim it's too costly to do the art work to have player appearances change as they level up but they are fine with charging over 5 euros for the DLC on each new race. The wood elf and lizardman stars have their heads cut and pasted onto the bodies of generic players of their respective races. It's beyond belief.  Edited 4/17/2016: Tomorrow will be 4 months after that Dec 18th announcement about the next four races and none of them are released yet and Cyanide has gone back into their shell of non-communication. Amazingly, the 5 minutes of work it'd take to correct the Orc roster still hasn't been done even though the game released over 6 months ago.  I've about given up hope and that's sad because I love what this game could be if they'd just communicate and put some work in. This game deserves better than Cyanide/Focus as its developer.
4182	0	a	Want to play with Wood elves or Lizard men? You better pirate the game then! Because they are pre-order exclusives and not available to buy as DLC.  I used to think that release day DLC was the worst business practice that drives people to piracy and kills the PC gaming industry, but now I think having exclusive pre order bonuses that's not even available as DLC is even worse. Piracy is not a criminal issue it is a service issue, is it really that hard for games companies to offer a better service than the pirate?! I would certainly don't mind throwing money at games companies if they can just get their act together.  For the record, I did buy the game on steam, but I don't want to play multiplayer if I can't play my favourite team (Wood Elves). I would recommend any potential buyers to either wait to pick up this game at the christmas sales when it will be bundled with more playable races, or to pirate it to play in local leagues.
4183	0	a	First time I'll leave a recommandation on Steam. Played countless hours on the board game, and on the precedent edition. I'm really ashamed to have supported this fraud with already enough time, and money.   -Metronomic boredom. Here's what I keep in mind from the gameplay (still resonates in my ears) :  '(...) Puf puf puf puf puf puf puf, huf. Puf puf. Puf puf puf, huf. (...)'  Its goes on for more than an hour.  Also, no pause (obviously), can't get away for a minute. Such irony for a turn-based game, game was judged already too slow to allow it to waste more time.   -Marketing depht of cereal commercials.  'Hey coaches ! Welcome to our wondeful user-friendly world, and please check-in with your credit card'. (check the Mighty Quest for Epic Loot for the exactly same approach, get the idea).   I hadn't the patience to finish an entire game. I spent most the time looking in all the features, trying to find some customization that would allow me to immerse myself in some team.  Well, everything is bland, and such an anemic content. Figured I can't play solo (no true compaign that is, and by this I mean : create a team, play matches, get experience, win cups. Silly me, such high expectations for Blood Bowl..).  Learnt I could refound on Steam. Felt robbed and stupid when I saw that my playtime was beyond 2 hours. Joke's on me. Hopefully not on you still.
4184	0	a	I've been playing with a friend within the same room now for weeks on our PC's, and we have both given up playing each other one on one within our own league. We both own a copy and I was really looking forward to playing Blood Bowl with him and showing him this game. I used to play the actual board game for years back in the day and loved it. I was so excited to see this game at first.  However, it soon became apparent that the random dice generator was not so random at all, worse, it actually was baised towards the team with a lower team value for example, or if we set up a best of three competition and I had won the first round and he needed to win the second match or lose. I did alot of reading to see if others experienced this issue. Many have with rergards to playing the A.I and some within multiplayer, however they came under fire alot from fan boys. However the problem does exist within multiplayer. It's just harder to see if you play loads of different players. It's got to a point now were me and my friend can't enjoy this game between the two of us.   It's mainly based around TV (team value). Once I start to climb above my friend, the dice rolls start to become ever more biased towards the lesser team. Worse, deaths and injuries bringing his team closer to my level. We have started over a new many a time with new teams and the game becomes fair as in equal bad luck good luck and it's great fun. It's only once I being a more experenced player, start to get a better side we start seeing really silly fake dice results.  It's like the games trying to keep it even and will ruin your side at times sending many of your team into your K'O and injury box just to level the playing field. Even though I'm a chaos side and he plays elves and is leaving himself open to block attacks with skills like mighty blow. Your try and go for it needing a roll of 2+ on a D6 and fail at crucial times even with re-rolls while the underdog pulls off multiple go for it's and crazy 33-50% odds with ease. That is until they level out around your team value or they push it to the stupid level within a turn beyond the crucial aspect of getting a touchdown.   Your be shoving the underdogs players around with puch dice while they crack out blitz after blitz, unless it's a non critical target that has no real bearing on the attempted touchdown, it's very disheartening for both of us. And when we do start again with new teams, it's laughable how different the rolls are! Suddenly my team start hurting his side, and he starts failing rolls like I do when I'm ahead of his team value by a fair bit. I don't have to eat through re-rolls to pull off 2+ roll on a apparent D6 dice, don't get sent off everytime I attempt a foul and can use the block dice without multiple skulls showing up.   Often I'll still win even with the heavely biased rolls against me, and still gain more SPP (skill points), which adds to my team value, which in turn makes the game perform ever more lame fake rolls. Stuff like death results followed by death results on key players even after re-rolls on the damage table. The underdog picking up the ball within multiple tackle zones at 33% then racing off to pass the ball with success across the pitch. While I can't even pick up the ball on a 67% chance and with re-rolls to boot. That is until both teams are more balanced with regards to me gaming with my friend.  With years of playing the board game, using real dice, you just don't see this, and it's a real shame because it truly ruins the experience for both players. My friend gets touch downs and it's like he donsen't feel like he even tried or deserved it, the game threw it at him to win. Then when we start a new, he gets totally owned until I start to take a team value lead, or it's a match which if I win, I win the small competition we set up.  I also play online aganist the public, it's much less obvious there, it's really only when just playing my friend and seeing our teams grow apart team value wise you really see it, but it does de-value your overal outlook, I mean luck is one thing, but fixed matches is another beast entirly. Often, players just quit when facing apparent bad luck. But it just shows that the dice rolls are toatally fixed, nothing at all like acutal dice.   This really is not just a rant about having some bad luck. I have a great chaos side online, and I still have fun though knowing the dice are not only fake, but will favour your side or the person your facing based on certain factors just takes a massive chunk out of the very essence of blood bowl. It's like your trying to find out what the programmed odds are going to let you get away with within a match and has very little to do with the % shown on the screen.  It's such a shame.
4185	0	a	The server for the game is soooo sloooow. Many matches are unplayable and result in dissconnetcion. Very frustrating!
4186	0	a	No amazons  No female wardancers  No player customization  Lack of Races ----------------------------- until the above is fixed i cannot recommend this game
4187	0	a	Bloodball should be a game of skill and numbers, I have alwasy played to percentages in both the table top vertion and orignal games, this one it dose not work.  The random genenerator need a fix, the computer cheats on the dice like mad. My roles are 80-90% worse then the AI's. Rather than trying to counter the other team I workign agenst the fact that I can not roll.  Added: Save and Exit game dose not work and knocked me back a game. I had one player die but two where removed from my rosta.  This game just feels unfinished or compleated by poor programmers.
4188	0	a	Let me start by saying my system exceeds all the recommended stats for this game. So you can imagine my surprise that in order to make the game stop crashing (well to be honest, the screen just goes black, but you can theoretically still play, you just can't see squat) I have to turn off the crowd and grass visualizations.  And then there are the times the opponent times out their turn and... nothing. yup, nothing. Logic would dictate that my turn would follow theirs, but sadly, no.  There are many other little annoying problems with this game, but the rest are fairly livable, but then why would you buy a game that runs like crap? Oh, and don't get me started on the really dumb 'new' AI.   Buy Blood Bowl Chaos Edition if you really want to play Blood Bowl. Wait until this pile of steaming Grobi droppings gets fixed. (Or more likely, seeing as it is Cyanide after all, the next version comes out. You know, Blood Bowl 2 The Pickpocket edition!)  *Edit* I also just found out that in single player if you lose connection to the internet you lose the game you were just playing. Of course it doesn't disconnect you during the game, just after the game it says 'Trying to reconnect to the internet' which I was connected to the internet (I'm not sure at what point I may have dc, but by the end of the game I was connected) and I waited 15 minutes of the game trying to reconnect without success. Another great idea by Cyanide (and yes I am aware it is not their original idea, but what a stupid idea)
4189	0	a	After playing eight or so hours of Blood Bowl 2, I was faced with nothing but losses for nothing but bad rolls. This game is nothing but luck based. You'd be better off going to a casino and spending 45 dollars of your hard-earned money. At least then you might get something out of it. The only reason I'd recommend this game is if you're already a hard-core Blood Bowl fan. It includes no races. The races are all extremely similar and it doesn't really make any difference which you pick. (Pick dwarves either way cause they always win.)
4190	0	a	Graphics up grade and ui up grade   The AI is terrible in solo play. Dice rolls are Skewed to add difficulty to the AI  You will roll skull almost a full 10% more than AI.
4191	0	a	This is a great game; alas... it is missing some vital features, that a BB game simply must have.   - It is not currently possible to see playname/playerrole above your palyers in game. You have to click every single player to find out exactly which of your linemen that player is. When you have 16 players, half of which have levels granting new abilities, then this uncertainty gets real tiresome. A must for afuture update and I would not get the game before it is out.  - Likewise, there is no way to see tacklezones constantly when you play, as it were in BB1. You have to start planning a specific move to see them, and you might have missed a tacklezone while moving all your other players, making the grand plan impossible in the end.... too late to reverse it. Togggleable tacklezone grid is a must!  - And lastly, it is really annoying that you can't expnd the dice roll log. This is not a must, but it would be a mayor Ui improvement if you could browse back and see all the rolls of a turn just passed; in order to calculate the total cahcne of some amazing move happening. A minor thing, but it would be nice.  Before at least the first 2 are in the game, I can't recommend buying it. Instead get BB1: Chaos Edition   ** It's been confirmed that they are working on a 'tactical view' and an extended dicelog. Sit tight! the changes will come eventually
4192	0	a	Its Blood Bowl 1 with better graphics, but its less 'complete' than Blood Bowl 1 was. There are just a lot of little things that are lacking. For example, there are no cheerleaders and no fans on the sidelines.   One of the new features is that you can build your own stadium, but the camera angles make it impossible to see if upgrading the stadium actually results in a visual change, and each race doesn't get their own unique stadium like in Blood Bowl 1. There is also a feature where you can build addons to your stadium, but the overwhelming majority of them are things you would *never* build. In fact, I can only think of three that you could ever want, and even then two of them you would only want as an elf team and the other as an orc or maybe dwarf team.  The singleplayer experience is also lacking compared to Blood Bowl 1. I liked how in Blood Bowl 1 you had the league system and there was a visual representation of progression for your team in terms of which league you were allowed to join. Blood Bowl 2 also has a league system for single player, but its just a single league that seems to *sort of* scale with your team. Plus there are no difficulty settings (at least that I could find).  Oh, and there is a game breaking single player bug where the other team just passes its turn without doing anything that is quite frequent.  And on the topic of bugs, the game is quite buggy. Other than the afformentioned game ruining single player bug, a lot of them are just minor interface or visual bugs that self correct. But its just annoying to have to deal with them in a $45 game.  The game also feels like it was designed for a controller and the mouse/keyboard controls are fairly hamfisted. Navigating the menus is more difficult than it should be, and I have a lot of instances of my players moving to the wrong square. I'm not chalking that last one up to bugs though as, again, I just think its that the mouse/keyboard controls are bad and imprecise.   I think that maybe in a few years, once the bugs are fixed, the interface is cleaned up, and more races are added the game is probably worth buying during a steam sale. But right now, unless you're a hardcore blood bowl fan, I would pass.
4193	0	a	I can't recommend the game until they at least get some form of real matchmaking in place. It's entirely too frustrating to try and play a game with a new or new-ish team only to get matched with an opponent with 500+ more Team Value than myself. This has happened consistently, with one of my Chaos teams having gotten no less than 3 opponents with team values in the 1500-1850 range in a row. While I was sub 1300 for at least two of those. Game is fine if you've got a group of friends and do an in-house league where you start off on the same foot and keep relative pace with one another, but trying to play in any public league is maddening for the reason above.   Once they fix that, I'll change to recommending the game as it's not a bad revised version thus far even if it has less overall content than BB1: Chaos Edition at the time of this writing. It shows promise, it just needs some kinks worked out. The most major of which to me is the matchmaking.
4194	0	a	♥♥♥♥♥♥ game full of bug with half the content the last one had... ♥♥♥♥ the game crash or bug every time im about to win but work well when i get my ♥♥♥ beat, it was funny the first but seriously because quickly enraging anyway can't suggest this for it price + it well probaly got a bunch of costly little dlc that will come soo just done waste your money on that.
4195	0	a	Wast of money. If you own the old one, just play that and save $50.
4196	0	a	It's just too reliant on RNG. The game punishes you for attempting to do something interesting by chucking more loaded dice at you. Just plain infuriating playing the AI and only fun with friends because you're laughing at it. Not to mention it's overpriced, and that's not even considering the wallet-vampire DLC plan they have planned. Don't recommend buying, try a game that requires skill, not praying that the game will allow you to enjoy yourself.  Also, idk if this is a bug, but a few times when blocking I've just been straight up knocked over. No cinematic, no dice rolled, just a turnover and an immediate alt-f4. One was a ratling thrower playing with my friend, the other was a human lineman with block, and my player was a dark elf witch lady with block as well. Just thought I'd add that.

4198	0	a	not the best game i have ever played. frankly i have played better
4199	0	a	To costy for what it is, you'll have your fun with it the models are somewhat good looking.   So... lets go for a PLUS and MINUS observation to be as objective as you can.  Plus:  There is a story mode that is MORE OR LESS a big tutoriel for the game. Online matches. An IA that will ocasinaly be really smart about Probability crunching. One totally new race for bloodbowl fans to descover. Finelooking models. Allright animations. The game is updated from time to time. If you buy it you can get free access to future races. Jim and Bob are Back with a fairly high amount of commentaries for your games.  Now... the Minus...  There are a LOT of cult teams that are missing and NOT anounced, Halfling teams, goblin teams, Chaos dwarfs teams, regular elf teams, Vampire teams, Kemry teams, Slaan teams, amazones teams and even ogre teams... are nowere to be seen.  There are a LOT of Race that are included into costy DLCs if you did NOT buy the game before they were added: Wood elves, Undeads, Norse, Necromantics, saurus... wich limits furthermore your gaming experiance.  The Races included in the base game are the most basic and/or uninteresting Ones: Humans, orcs, Dark elves, high elves, skaven, dwarves are basicaly what you are gonahave to play with.  The game is costy as BALLS.  There are a LOT of really experianced players online making newplayers   The learning curve is really steep and the tutoriel won't help you in your first decision makings.  There is only 4 stadiums in which you can play with 4 variants in each.  I do recomand to take it... if and ONLY if there is a big promotion on the game... or that you are offered every bonus things for free... it really looks like a Beta game.
4200	0	a	Just not enough new content, to charge for a full game.
4201	0	a	Just one thing : DLC...  Go play BB1, don't buy this one. That's a shame. From 20 races to 8. If you want the full game, you'll have to wait and pay more.
4202	0	a	Quite a few annoying bugs. Like you have to use your re-roll if other team only get good options when they choose dice for you. Grew boring fast. Also it is too much alike Blood Bowl.
4203	0	a	Blood Bowl 2, like Blood Bowl but... Shiney.  So, i'm speaking purely from the perspective of a casual player of the first game. I have no interest in playing in online leagues except with freinds, and i'm not looking for super hard AI like a machocist. Call me a scrub or whatever, thats fine, but with that in mind I can't recomend this game.  I'll start with what I like/love. The UI is soooo much better, I don't have to look through the rulebook anymore to determine whether or not I can make a dodge, the game will actualy give me PERCENTAGES on actions like that. A little thing, you might think, but it's a huge improvement on the first. The graphics are lovely, as are the brutal animations, that i've yet to get tired of watching.  Campaign basicaly serves as the new tutorial mode from what I can tell (Have yet to play it all), and it seems legit. The first game had a 'tutorial', where the first part of the rulebook for the board game was read out and it asked you to do a few basic things before dropping you in and letting you figure out the rest. This seems like more of a lengthly, in-depth afair with some neat narrative and story built in, so thats nice.  Can't really talk about online, as I said at the start. But the solo leagues give you plently of options. Make a team and take them through elimination style cups or round robin modes, and your team will remain consistant with injuries, perma-deaths, level ups and even retirements of players when they get too old (Though very few blood-bowl players make it that far).  Annnnd now my biggest problem with the game: The AI. Outside of freindly matches (Pick teams, have one match with no consequences afterwards) YOU ARE NOT ABLE TO PICK THE DIFFICULTY OF THE AI. Solo leagues all seem to feature random AI difficulties. I've heard somewhere that they scale, but for me it's seemed totaly random.  As I said before, I am a casual player. I can face easy/meduim difficulty AI and still have a challangingly fun time. But with this system on AI in solo leagues, no matter what, I am guarenteed to hit a brick wall of difficulty. I could play through 2 rounds of a 3 round elimination tournament and have a nice level of AI, but the third match will suddenly be a ♥♥♥♥-show where the AI has suddenly shifted to either hard or brutal difficulty.  It's all good having a scaling system, but it seems to alienate players from both worlds. People looking for difficulty will steamroll through boring games regularaly, whereas casual, new players will always encounter matches that will frustrate and put them off the game. It would be much better for both sides if you could set the AI to whatever you want, or have something of a fighting game system, where it scales in a concentrated way, say from easy at the start to meduim at the end, or from meduim at the start then hard at the end.    *deep breath*  That aside, I don't have any other problems with the game. I'm not even bothered about the lack of teams compared to the first game (The first game had 23 teams as of Blood Bowl: Chaos Edition, whereas Blood Bowl 2 has 8, with lots of DLC coming). It has all the races I want to play (Orcs and Skaven) so I don't care. But unfortunately thanks to that issue the enjoyment I get out of the game is far outweighed by the frustration and salt.   TL;DR version (I don't blame you): Blood Bowl 2 is great, but because of the way the AI is scaled/random in solo leagues (The only mode i'm interested in playing), I can't recommend it to people looking to play casually. Unless they patch it so that you can set the difficulty, I won't be continuing to play except with the occasional friend perhaps. Shame.
4204	0	a	Can't recommend this if you own Blood bowl chaos edition.  All this game is at its core is a UI and graphics overhaul of the original with far less teams, less player customisation (no armour etc to buy on level up) and the same dull single player experience.   I was hoping that in this game they would flesh out the single player league games but its still the same affair. This may have been made by a small studio but in my eyes they should have expanded on what the original offered, not made it smaller and prettier.   Typical sports 'sequel' that isnt value for money and offers virtually nothing over the original. 
4205	0	a	BB2 vs BB:Chaos edition. + Graphics and animations are better. + AI is better, but who cares? This is multiplayer game. + Only ONE new race- Bretonnians + Tutorial for new players  - WE HAVE ONLY 8 RACES INSTED OF 23!!!!!  If you want to play Blood Bowl, it's better idea to buy Chaos edition.
4206	0	a	Probably better to just use your money to buy blood bowl 1. If the price on this comes down to $25 or so it'll be an ok purchase. Updated graphics on this but it's the same dicey garbage it always was. You'll find yourself highly annoyed by the AI's ability to micro the hell out of each and every single move.  Edit:  After my review I installed it again and played through to 75%. You will find it highly annoying watching the dice roll against you in the single player campaign. Again, I'd wait for a sale. I think that people who enjoy this game have a high frustration tolerence - an admirable trait. I don't have that. I hate watching my best strategied get stifled by 'elven tap dancery'. .cant counter them either with the humans in the campaign on 1 blitz per turn.
4207	0	a	For me, Blood Bowl 2 is a disappointment. Many years ago I had the tabletop Blood Bowl game and until now, I had forgotten how little I actually played it. Essentially, I think the problem is that sports are usually fast paced, and this is not. Involving dice rolls slows things down to the point that the excitement disappears. Playing Blood Bowl 2 on the PC is frankly slow and dull. Moreover, the graphics aren't particularly amazing and the commentary has more life than the game, although you wish they would shut up and let you get on with it.  In game, the team members have a limited range of actions, and much of the time is just spent knocking over the opposition, or being knocked over by them. The feel of the game is rather like a graphically enhanced version of the Windows classic 'Minesweeper'. I was expecting the action to feel a bit more like XCom: Enemy Unknown, but sadly it doesn't.

4211	0	a	Blood Bowl 2 is a lemon wrapped in nice graphics.  Wait till it hits the discount bin.  First the positives. The graphics do look pretty, especially in the trailer. Their graphic assets are a lot better than their first blood bowl game.  Unfortunately, that is where the positivies stop.  The game feels broken. Not buggy but rather suffering from poor designed.  The random dice rolls do not feel random.    The graphic animations are on repeat and get boring very quickly. The camera keeps on zooming around the field making it hard to see what is happening. The matching system is still a joke, although a bit better than in the previous game.  So overall, you once again have a set of great board game rules wrapped up in a second rate computer game.  On top of that this company has very poor community management. Servers go down without notice, forum postings seem to be random... etc.   Not recommended.
4212	0	a	One word springs to mind with this game .... Rigged.  I know this is a RNG game, but there just seem to be too many occurances of AI rigged rolls to be ignored. Some players claim to have played through and never lost a game, or conceded a point, fair play to them. However there are also a large number of players that like me are frustrated with failing every dodge or go-for it. Failing to pick up the ball when you have a 80+% chance of picking it up. While seeing an opponent who does not seem to be able to fail to dodge your tackled zones, and gets a knock down on almost every block.  I got his game when it was reduced recently and I still feel like asking for my money back. The game itself looks good, and runs smoothly however the game lacks any feel of a campaign. The solo player campaign is a tutorial, which again seems to be rigged to make you lose by about the 4th match, and the solo leagues are just multiplayer against an AI. My advice would be to check Ebay for a copy of the original Bloodbowl board game, get some mates round, a few beers (age permitting) in, roll some real dice and play the game like it was meant to be played. It was a brutal game, but at least it was a fair brutal game. Not one that seems to delight in throwing you to the ground then grinding your face in the turf with an ogre boot.
4213	0	a	More of the same from Cyanide Studios....but slllooowwweeed doooowwwnnn..dear God, it takes about 10 mins to make a 2min turn and taking into account that there are now eight turns per half, prepare yourself for 90 min matches. For me, this is simplty too slow, there are never any chance to have a feel of continuity with a team when it feels like about a week between coaching sceens. The main thing I loved from the first Bloodbowl (which I was a sucker for, buying all DLC etc) was the way your team grew and improved itself over time. This now takes so long that it is hardly a factor. I now find myself too bored between turns to properly focus, leading to a lack of tacticality and so lose more matches, meaning Im less into it, leading the whole experience into a death spiral which inevitably leads me to reach for a different game.  Overall, slow, not much new, just a moneymaking re-hash from a studio that has lost the original meaning of the bloodbowl...a shame.
4214	0	a	Probably one of the worst and most infurating games I've ever played. Just watch the Crendor League on YouTube and it'll tell you all you need to know. This is a game entirely based on chance/luck.
4215	0	a	When you are a console gamer than you would love the user interface. For all pc gamers, who dont play online leagues, I would give the advice buy the old Blood Bowl -Chaos edition, BB1 has the older graphics but is the better game in every other aspect. As single player I loved the campaign in BB1 but in this game even if I play a normal match I press ALT+F4 during the first half time. The UI and camera perspective is so bad it hurts. The attention to the details (e.g. cheerleadres) which made BB1 so great and I loved it are missing, this game make for me the impression that is half designed and programmed and thrown to the market. I am realy disappointed about this game. If you need an example that graphic is not all this game is a perfect example for this!
4216	0	a	I've played a lot of Blood Bowl games, and while this is nearly the worst one at least it's not the very worst digital version. It is a bit better than the very original vanilla version of Blood Bowl (PC or Xbox) years ago. However, Chaos Edition BB1 is still much stronger.  BB2 suffers from poor stability, a terrible UX, stripped down team lists, and frustrating decisions from Cyanide. It does look better than previous versions, but like Debbie in 10th grade just because she looks a little better doesn't make her any less of a soul-sucking disappointment. Stick with BBCE and you'll be much happier.
4217	0	a	I feel this game is not playable for anyone who has bad luck with dice rolls. If I could get my money back I would.
4218	0	a	This game is terrible, boring, slow and extremely lack lustre, i reccommend grabbing your money and burning it as that 30 seconds of buring your cash will bring you more enjoyment. first time i ever requested a refund!

4220	0	a	Don't buy this game! then maybe they'll fix dice in BB3!!!  I played 1097 hours Chaos Edition. BB2 and this game has no dice, only dice animation. AI calculates risks before every turn and you have to play in that risk order. there is no dice, only 'yes' or 'no's. This is an 'arcade' game not a board game 'simulation'.  I hope Games Workshop cancels franchise agreement with Cyanide. So we can play this epic board game online. I shared lots of videos about dodging Minotaurs and opened threads on forums about injuring 8 dwarves in a match with skaven, Guess what happened. they supressed or deleted my threads with their forum guard dogs. Because they want to win more money without earning!  (sorry for my bad english)
4221	0	a	Disappointment... The game is a faithful adaptation to the board game but does not improve from BB1  The good: graphics and animations The bad: UI is painful, in solo there is no possibility to save during a game (and if you quit because you don't have 1 hour to finish then you just forfeit), IA is poor and doesnt represent a challenge, there is no real long term interest to play solo, RNG extremely suspicious from time to time, DLC fest if you want to have all the races  So yes the game looks better than the first one but that's all for the improvements, there is still no real solo game where the only challenge will be how lucky you are with the dices, so unless you are planning to play with friends I don't recommand this one.
4222	0	a	Before you buy this game look up on line what 'RUBBER BANDING' is. The game is rigged.  I would like to recoment this game but I cant. Purchase with CAUTION I want to like this game but like the last one it is the hardest game I have ever played. IF you are going to buy this game get ready for a lot of frustration, a lot of frustration.  The game looks great but everytime I play it feels like the computer is at a advantage. The only way to really improve this game would be some cheats to even out the playing field.  I mean in one turn the computer can level my intire team. GOOD LUCK.
4223	0	a	No way near as good as the first one, and yes the graphics are slightly better but still feel very outdated.....  the game unfortunately, in my opinion is terrible

4226	0	a	People can just cheat and give thier teams the level up attributes they need. so what is the point. Also the leagues are stupid you have to join 1 of the big 2 right away or good luck getting games without long waits
4227	0	a	This game is incomplete. The original Blood Bowl does a better job of asking if you want to use a skill, has more available teams, you can visually see the level and mutations on on players. Until these things are updated/fixed, I cant recommend it.
4228	0	a	It's still the classic fantasy football board game, but with half the teams to choose from.  If you want the other teams, you'll have to pay extra for them (DLCs).  The newest features would be the mircotransactions...  Bad industry! Give us finished products to consume or go sit on the time-out-chair.
4229	0	a	what a complete failure the AI won't even score if it is the last thing in turn 16 that it can do, just walk into the endzone without any dice rolls buy this game only if you want to play against other players the single player mode is a 100% rippoff not even worth 5 euro
4230	0	a	An upgrade to Bloodbowl 1 which is long overdue. I am very happy with the game except for the lack of teams, but they will come in DLC eventually. Game is good IMO and I love Bloodbowl.  An update to my review months after release. Cyanide has squandered time and have not released any new teams. The game is all but dead now. I really hate Cyanide for ruining digital Bllod bowl. They are terrible French developers that do not listen or communicate. My recommendation is now a thumbs down.
4231	0	a	Quite annoying really, For £34.99 i expected a lot more. I loved the original game so much i bought it twice but this is a real step back, no real single player campaign game (you can play as one human team in a basic tutorial) and problems with the resolution (no fullscreen) on low graphics settings, for such a basic game this is unacceptable.  The multiplayer was fun but swamped with chaos and orc teams which limits variety.

4233	0	a	Let's face it you probably watched the trailers and said this game looks awesome! The screenshots made you drool...  Well the advertising is overselling as usual.  What it doesn't show you is: - The impossible AI with no level selection. Yes, that means you will always be fighting an uphill battle even against the AI. The AI isn't that smart, but the developers made up for that by rigging their dice. - Brute force teams; Dwarves, Lizardmen, Chaos, Orks, etc... are the only really playable teams. As long as you use the standard cage formation you will basically never lose the ball nor break through their cage. So much for creative strategy. How to use: 1 cage per game, rinse and repeat as needed. - Elves and skaven are highly underpowered (This presents a problem if you are an Elf lover like myself). Maybe they don't have strength but they can pass and run. However, what good is that when they can barely beat or avoid brute force lines and then run only half way (skaven; full way).  - That all actions in the game are luck based (obviously as all actions are based on dice rolls) but certain basic actions you would assume a monkey could do are possible to fail (eg pick up a ball). I understand that this is a way the game progresses. However, when a guy fails to pick up a ball two turns in a row, it's not unfortunate, it's a form of mental disablity. (Note: not an actual issue, just something that ticks me off, and believe me you will be too) - The money system used to form teams is unfair to newer players. You are given just enough money to make a basic team and then plus a little extra to buy 'staff'. However if you don't buy the better players to buy more staff you're at a disadvantage to almost all. If you buy better players and can't buy as much staff then you are a disadvantage to more experienced players (who usually have a lot).  - Finally, minor side effect: The cutscenes that make you fall in love with the game in the ads will become redundant and tiresome fairly quickly (You can diable them, but its cutting out a great cinematic feature that you would like to watch but don't want to see repated five times a half). For more understanding of this watch and rewatch the trailer for an hour and that's just sums up one game.  Finally, on a personal note I bought this game thinking it would be a fun strategy game I could play while relaxing after work/college. It's anything but relaxing, it is agravating as a any Call of Duty multiplayer. As I mentioned, it is luck based and when everything goes right, it feels great. But that's rare. Usually, you'll find yourself at the corner of Unlucky and Not Skilled Enough. When you are 5 steps from a touch down and that's when things go wrong, it's almost enough to just quit the game then and there. It's a fun game if you have patients for the BS you'll have to wade through to become good. I however, do not.  If you decide to buy it, I wish you the best of luck.   Thank you for your time and I hope I was of some aid in your decision.
4234	0	a	its a good game and all but its match making is absolute trash, youre as likely to go up against a extremely well seasoned coach and team as you are a brand new one. they need to fix it
4235	0	a	Single Player only lets you play one team...
4236	0	a	Its not a bad game but its not good either. When this game came out it was great because almost everyone was on a even level now the game is completly unbalanced because you NEED TO WIN to get money, leveling of your team. playing anything remotly squishy like the rats are very prone to die btw death means no matter how much you leveled  that character or how key he was you need to get a replacement because you'll nerver see him again. This makes all the tanky teams really broken because they get to stay leveled longeur.  
4237	0	a	Blood Bowl 2 by Cyanide should not be anyone's first experience with Blood Bowl.   Blood Bowl has been around since 1986 and its third edition won an Origin Award for best miniatures rules in 1994. I will say the bulk of the rules work after Death Zone was done by amateurs and not properly play tested. I have been playing since second edition but quickly adopted the third edition upon its release. I have also successfully studied probability, statistics, logic, and programming at the collegiate level. I apply statistics, calculus level math, and light computer programming in my daily job.  The probability, logic, and programming of BB2 are all broken. They have failed to monetize it correctly, missing out on a substantial sum, and instead are gouging the few players they have on DLC that should be included. They fail to police their online play; resulting in free range for cheats and hacks. They also ignore their own support emails. The community is largely apathetic to these issues and typically respond with the chorus of, “find a private league. Either this or they openly attack the person broaching the issue with nitpicks or failed math. Please read on statistical sample size determination, standard deviation, and confidence interval, don’t stop with high school probability. It shows a failure of opportunity.  The only people who should purchase this game are people who truly understand what Blood Bowl is and are unable to sit across a board with friends. If you know what Blood Bowl is and your work, life, gaming balance is such that you cannot play in person; buy BB2. Keeping it alive may convince a good publisher to pick up the torch and do it right. A person who has never had the fun of rolling the block dice, please avoid for your own good.
4238	0	a	The complete lack of in game tutorial for this overly complex game makes playing it an utter waste of time. There is a reason the phyisical game comes with a ♥♥♥♥ING RULEBOOK
4239	0	a	♥♥♥♥♥♥ upgrade from previous games, no real campaign, destroyed rules in turoial, mismanaged online legaue play - this sucks so much I'd like to get a refund immediately. 
4240	0	a	Honestly it just felt like the developers didn't give a rat's ♥♥♥ on this one. Single player options and a general lack of choice for what you want to do is completely gone. Instead they give you one ♥♥♥♥♥♥ team and no option beyond that. Online is online and it just isn't as fun with what little they give you. This game overall is very lacklustre and overpriced for what it is. Not worth the $50 I payed for, not worth the 10-15 FPS, and not worth having only 10 playable races (2 are DLC). Just get Blood Bowl: chaos edition instead.
4241	0	a	This is the one of the worst games ever made, save yourself money and buy something else. Anything is better then this tripe that their trying to pass of for a game. The AI is absoloutly terrible and the random dice are just a joke, the game favours one side before each match and if thats not you your stuffed. This comming form someone who wins most games. BB2 is a massive step backwards for a game that showed so much promise. The single player campaign is worthless with team options being dictated to you and you having to play an already created team unlike bb1. Graphics are disgraceful, Ive expirienced that many blackscreen crashes its not funny, and with recovery of match in Multiplayer non-exsistant, it results in a loss, its downright terrible game. As I said the game picks a winner before the match begins and if thats not you then you'll be pushing ^%&amp;# up hill to do anything productive in a match. Randomness their is no randomness in this disgraceful piece of programming. The concept of the game is great, football with extra violence but all this game does is leave the user wanting for possibilities that may have been! -10 out of 10. Repeat - Dont waste your cash, PLEASE DONT WASTE YOUR TIME, YOUVE BEEN WARNED!!
4242	0	a	Fewer races compared to the original (from what I heard there were a LOT more options), still a bit buggy, deffinetly not worth £35   Races don't feel ballanced , I've been told I have to accept that - sorry, no - the developers should work on a ballance.  It s fun but frustrating game, considering the quality of the game and the current price, I would not recommend it at this point.   
4243	0	a	I have mixed feeling about this game. After about 12 hours of playing the campaign, studying strats and starting team builds, I went multiplayer and got handily taken apart. Most of my opponents were at least a few hundred points higher level.   In my experience, considering how long the games run (about an hour) the game does a poor job of making you feel like you are actually having fun or working towards something. That being said, I think particularly intelligent people or people who are talented at strategy games may find this game quite fun. In that sense it's very niche.  Not sure whether I would recommend this to my friends or gamer coworkers. I'm just not sure they would find it fun.
4244	0	a	To Long Didnt Watch: Great for new players and those who have never played bloodbowl before. A bit dissapointing for fans of the original game or hard core players of the table top minitures game. Blood Bowl 2 features water down rules which significant effect the risk management decisions, to the point of near elimination. I recommend caution, for fans of the series, but new players should find it much easier to pick up and play with the simplified rules. Plus the tutorial really holds your hand. (Yes you have to go through the hand holding if you have played 100+ games of bloodbowl and could write the rulebook from memory) P.S. You also have to play as humans, which sucks if you dont usually play as humans.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-ePLuN6MKI&amp;list=PL3g25GfHOMYdA9Nvn6wr6lQ21LWW9Wa7U&amp;index=55 
4245	0	a	The most painfully RNG dominated game on the planet. The concept for Blood Bowl is awesome, but when the best strategy is to try to do nothing so you dont have to roll the dice and have a chance to get screwed something is wrong.
4246	0	a	I really wanted to like this game, but this game seems unfinished. There are only 8 playable races out of the 20 from the first game. You cannot choose your race in campaign, only in multiplayer, and the graphic for every single knockdown is exactly the same. You literally watch that clip 20-40 times per match. I got this game on sale, so im not too sad, but this game had the potential for much much more.
4247	0	a	absolutely not Worth the $50 CAD it's put up for. Should have listened to the reviews. The game is incredibly unfair since there are no ranks and a max level player with amazing players can play against a begginer team with absolute ♥♥♥♥ guys. The community is even worse. Even if you're living in NA you're gonna have to play against russians, french, and chinese guys. This isn't good since I don't get to have a conversation with the other guy.        DONT EVEN THINK ABOUT GETTING THIS GAME IT MAY SEEM GOOD BUT ITS ACTUALLY BAD PLEASE LISTEN TO THE REVIEWS AND AVOID THIS GAME AT ALL COSTS.   Sorry crendawg : /
4248	0	a	I have to say, I don't normally write reviews. Mainly because you don't know if the person is just being whiny or not because he/she loses. Well I can honestly say that this game seems to have more potential than most. I want to LOVE it so much. But I can't. Its broken. The rules it places for the game, it doesn't honor them half the time. It doesn't balance a team of your lvl as your opponent, Unless you play solo and select easy. DLC Teams are overpowered, which is all I fought in Multiplayer. and 9 times out of 10... RNG WILL not let you have a chance in H**L of winning. This CAN be great, but isn't in it's current state. They need to fix team balance issues, multiplayer match-up balancing, the rules need to work, and work on making RNG not F**K up your day EVERY TIME YOU PLAY. My opinion is unless you buy more(DLC) RNG will hate you. It shouldn't be P2W if it's not a F2P game or an MMO at all. Thank God I bought this on a SUPER discount or I would have been more upset then I am. And this is a Prime reason I don't buy games anymore unless I can try them out 1st. When/If they fix the game... I'll write a more positive review. Oh and No I havn't won a game yet... but when RNG makes you're whole team stunned or knocked out or DEAD by Turn 3 it's hard to do, while the other team has 1 stun. I hope they fix the game soon.
4249	0	a	I've been playing BB1 Chaos Edition for over 200 hours - often friendly matches with a friend online. I knew that the rules, the abilities of the players as well as the team rosters would not change in BB2: I was nevertheless really looking forward to the new version:   the graphics looked great, the commentary seemed fresher (maybe even with more variations?), the transfer market sounded like a good feature.  After playing the first matches I cannot recommend to buy this, but rather to stay with or try out the BB1: Chaos edition.  Some reasons for this recommendation are: - As usual many races (teams) are missing from this first version of BB2 - Even less pre-generated teams than in BB1:CE (only three per race) - The options for customization of graphics and controls is limited / non existing. - The language selection is limited to english and french (not a point of major critics but still less options than in BB1:CE). - Some other features from the 6 year old BB1 are missing: most prominient the team editor - I cannot customize a team to use e.g. in a friendly match by adjusting its team value, its players skills and equipment - no possibility to change camera perspective during the match.   Wait for the game to be patched to completion or to drop in price.
4250	0	a	The game is more luck based than anything else. The only strategy comes from trying to minimize the amount of rolls you do. The game also seems to randomly pick someone at the start of the match and give them all the bad rolls which leads to some very frustrating instances where you are forced to lose to others. It can be fun occassionaly but the game is mostly just frustrating.
4251	0	a	I really wanted to be able to write a positive review about this game but I can't. The short version of what could be a long review is that the game is fun, but it is completely lacking in long term playability due to the multiplayer matchmaking system being absolutely horrid.   This game is not fun for more than a few matches against the AI. If there was a human element, it would be far more enjoyable but I refuse to sit and wait in a queue for 10 minutes to play one game that the opponent will drop out of 75% of the time after 5 minutes.
4252	0	a	The campaign is alright... frustrating but fair....  The multiplayer is complete garbage at low levels, ALL of my games have been ended by forfeit.  Strategy on offense is the same with every race, make a box and push until you break through or push through enough to handoff. The outcome is entirely dependent on RNG and who has more rerolls because the strategy is so stagnant.  Some games start with random events that effect the initial play. Once I had 6 players stunned on the field before kickoff and my opponent had only 1 stunned.  If you enjoy the card game War, where the strategy is always the same, the outcome is dependent on luck and randomly someone gets punched in the face for no reason, then this is the game for you!  
4253	0	a	Bloodbowl original was so playable. Opponent's turns were able to be speeded up and was full screen. This is great on graphics, but too slow. The fights are great the first time you see them... the fortieth time they wear very thin. Given the choice of playing this or the original I am going back to the original. One good thing, the AI seems better. Put this AI in the original game and you have something worth spending money on,

4255	0	a	The expectations from the board game played 15 years ago kinda killed the feeling for the game. Maybe if the actions where visualized with the dice-rolls involved would bring more to it? 
4256	0	a	This game is the digital embodiment of salt. The RNG is the worst I've seen. Play conservatively? Nah, you still roll ones. New team? Cool! Let's put you against the most skilled bashy team in the league! No SPP for you!   I should have thrown the money in the garbage, I'd have enjoyed that more.
4257	0	a	Just buy BB1: Chaos Edition
4258	0	a	Pross: 1) Good graphics and animations, looks much more like a show Blood Bowl claims to be. Just watch it on youtube, no need to buy it because of that. After a couple of days this impression will diminish, and what will remain is below.  Cons: 1) Almost zero singleplayer value. AI still is pretty bad, short campaign is nothing more than a tutorial. What left is a generic random matchmaking, without any elements that could add some variety (that were proposed by fans, btw, like add custom made weather/regional conditions and random events, that are not in the officail rules, it would be okay for single-player) That's not a big problem, for me at least, but this does not differ from the previous game (Chaos Edition), so no reason to pay for that. 2) Changes to official rules being unconditionally enforced by Cyanide (aging, changes of players' costs, many skills are now being used without your consent thus limiting tactical options). Wouldn't have been a problem if that was optional changes and you could create a custom league where official rules are in place, but in its current implementation it's untolerable. 3) Unintuitive, inconvinient console-oriented UI. Some its design flaws are imported straight from the previous game, what means that Cyanide does not learn, and does not care about feedback from their players. No grid, no player names/classes on the field atm, quite irritating approach to visualization of team during setups (those long waits when they run from position to position). Horrible league management UI atm.  Update: Last patch indeed introduced some major improvements to the game. !Some! skills at last became optional (not all that should be), and they made better design of the setup phase, no long waits anymore. Still, they haven't yet reached conformance with the official rules, neither they offered option to create a custom league with such rules.  Updated verdict: still refrain from buying it at least for now, or wait for a huge discount. Unless you have some faith in Cynanide and their ability to listen.
4259	0	a	I do not recommend it, because it is less polished than the Chaos Edition and it is much more expensive and a little bit Pay to Win because the best races has to be bought per DLC. The leage system is less adjustable, for example if you do not want to have player aging you have to play online against real people because it is only then able to turn off. It has although to make an additional account which has to be online. If you just want to play online buy it at sale if offline buy better chaos edition.
4260	0	a	Bloodbowl is bloodbowl, caging, breaking cage and screening, if you are a fan you will like the game. But the game itself is very poor (no team customisations, no racial cheerleaders, no skin upgrade per level (what ?? seriously in 2015 no skin upgrade on players, bunch of lazy devs !) solo is a joke, multi config non existant), and badly designed (console UI, TV is ok but in replay you can't go back or forward ... all seems so amateurish,there is no graphic options !!). The game itself is not bad (animations are great), but lacks of polishing ( stadium are just jokes) and are far too long ... 1h30 - 2 h per match isn't correct. The ratio time given/ xp earned is too high.. graphics are ok but not amazing at all (again for a bloodbowl 2015 game, its far too low, it's not like they had to create a complete game, the rules are the same since 35 years...) But the most important is that the number of teams available (8) is so small you get bored really fast...how in hell can they thought 8 races for a modern 50 bucks game would be tolerated ? the game had bad reviews from players mostly because of this and it's totlally normal. BOREDOMBOWL 2...To finish, on 10 matches today , i had 7 times a match against Lizard Men who at this stage of the game is the team everyone plays because it's OP and that's one of the consequence of all this lazy greedy (dlc..) décisions of Cyanide..it's a game of our times, fake work for quick cash.
4261	0	a	So the game concept is good the art is fun and the matches can be interesting... However sometimes it comes down to sheer dumb luck. It can be frustrating and enjoyable depending on which side of the ball your on...  With all that being said I am going to post one reason alone not to get this game which is the actual match making functions... Several times now I have been matched up against teams over a thousand points ahead of me. When my highest guy is level four and his lowest guy has more experience then my entire team put together...  Yes the game then gives you inducements in the form of petty cash. However if the person your going against is that high ranking he usually has some freegold to buy his own as well. That and even with what you can buy those basic skills the player has leveled up are better by far then anything you can buy and your regular team becomes just targets...  So why not to buy? Because against those teams that the computer matches you your only option is to quit out. If you play them they will literally just kill and injure all your players to the point you have to delete your team.  I understand I am not going to win every match however until the matchmaking system has a cap limiting such a huge imbalance it is simply not worth playing. Investing 20 hours into a team then having it wiped out because the computer thought your level 3 and 4 guys can take on another team of level 7s with full inducements...  This game does have potential it needs to have some serious looks at certain functions of it as it stands though.
4262	0	a	Be aware even in a solo league against AI if it drops connections at the end of the match your game won't count for your league.... but it wont tell you just nothing will happen... much like FIFA's servers... sort it out tbh
4263	0	a	Eh, a mac alternative to the other blood bowls, but definitely not as good. do not get this. Less races/diversity. 
4264	0	a	I have reached my limit for trying to get a game to run. I have not even been able to start a game despite updates, driver updates, having to go in and rename and delete files to even get started. This all seems not ready for prime time. I have no other recourse but to let it age in my library. Save yourself the money untill all the bugs have been worked out. Don't pay to be a unacknolegde alpha tester for these guys. I was a big fan of BBCE and will continue to play it. I was hopefull, now my heart is full of woe.
4265	0	a	errrrm, I changed the resolution and now the cursor is out of calibration with the game and I can't click anything in the lower half of the screen. As a result I can't even change the resolution back. I've tried reinstalling twice, but no dice. I've even tried to change the resolution in the config.xml file but it reset when I opened the game. Fix this bug as I can't play this game. Money totally wasted!

4267	0	a	I have reached my limit for trying to get a game to run. I have not even been able to start a game despite updates, driver updates, having to go in and rename and delete files to even get started. This all seems not ready for prime time. I have no other recourse but to let it age in my library. Save yourself the money untill all the bugs have been worked out. Don't pay to be a unacknolegde alpha tester for these guys. I was a big fan of BBCE and will continue to play it. I was hopefull, now my heart is full of woe.
4268	0	a	The server issues are unbearable. Why can't we get a game that does not require 1 minute worth of server errors each players turn? I thought your company was a professional buisness and not some second rate organization.
4269	0	a	I purchased this game on sale since it looked interesting, upon launching this game for the first time it immediately crashed and would not get passed the first few seconds of the opening logo. Upon research it appears as though this is a very common issue; the developer has made efforts to try and walk people through running the game as ADMIN; but since it did not work after I ran the game as the devolper requested I will be returning this for a refund.   Be careful what you buy, I ignored the reviews and they seem to be pretty accurate.
4270	0	a	errrrm, I changed the resolution and now the cursor is out of calibration with the game and I can't click anything in the lower half of the screen. As a result I can't even change the resolution back. I've tried reinstalling twice, but no dice. I've even tried to change the resolution in the config.xml file but it reset when I opened the game. Fix this bug as I can't play this game. Money totally wasted!
4271	0	a	Playing this game is like sticking yourself in the eye with a fork. . . repeatedly. Has anyone told the developers that games are supposed to be fun.

4273	0	a	Honestly I bought this ignoring the press round it. I hoped that it was just people being picky, I hoped that the animations would make up for the early flaws, I hoped the graphical updates would distract me from the missing teams.  In short they didnt. Dont get me wrong its pretty and if this is your first taste of blood bowl it will be a nice experiance for you. But over use of the same animations will have tou turning them off quickly.  The devs have watered down the game or done something very wrong because this game lacks something, someone in my chat called it the soul of blood bowl and I have to agree with them.  The lack of teams The lack of game modes The lack of a stadium for each team The Campaign is human only No new kill/injury animations Block animations are incredibly repetative  and these are only the beginings of a list of flaws but some of the most glaring  In short I hope these issues and others are resolved in forth coming patches but as of right now,  AVOID THIS GAME! Go back and play chaos edition till this is worked on, it currently seems rushed and not at all worth it's price I had high hopes for it but honestly its left me with a sour taste in my mouth
4274	0	a	Still not worth it. Cool graphics and all but not even worth it with 60% off.
4275	0	a	The matches can be entertaining but just from a single-player perspective I'd put this down as a miss. The AI is not capable at all of putting up a fight, it can occaisionaly win due to the heavy focus on RNG but it is worthless at even the basic blitz attack never mind any of the more advanced tactics.  Never tried MP, I'll let others judge wether the game is worth it for that aspect.
4276	0	a	Would be awesome, if the game was polished and not crashing to desktop with no reconnect feature... what a sad excuse for something that could have been awesome.  If they get around to fixing bugs and making it more multiplayer friendly it will be epic, for now it is utter crashing ♥♥♥♥.
4277	0	a	I just feel like its not worth the money plain and simple. I wish more people would just play bb1. Requesting a refund at this point.
4278	0	a	Completly new player unfriendly game (not the community, the game) Cannot recommend to anyone but people who like to torment themselves with a game based on skill but mostly on annoying RNG. If you have the patience for the RNG and stupendously slow gamepace (animations are slowing the game pace down amongst other mechanics) then this could be the game for you.  Oh and it gets tediously boring when you know you cannot win, because you can just sit there and take it for x amount of turns or concede and get no rewards at all...fun. Why isnt there a feature where both agree the game is over, that the game ends and players get their respective rewards (the loosers obviously diminished but still get something). Adding to that ageing players, and low customization.... On sale its decently priced...but i wouldnt really recommend it anyway, i sort of regret my purchase but now its to late.  Edit: Atleast i got my fair share of gametime for the money spent, most of it frustrating but still. So if you get it on sale and count your entertainment at 1$/hour or there abouts, then go for it, you might actually get decent value for your money (dont buy all the dlc thou, read up because you might never use certain races.)
4279	0	a	You are better off sticking with Blood Bowl: Chaos Edition. Other then upgraded graphics there is no reason to buy this game.
4280	0	a	complete trash waste of money.Complete destruction of a pretty good table top game made into a farce .nuffle the god of dice is the program ♥♥♥♥ing with the dice rolls of the game.There is also numerous hackers so prepare to get killed buy hackers that never fail dice rolls.
4281	0	a	FIX THE GAME OR DON'T SELL IT, SO TIRED OF BUYING GAMES THAT DON'T WORK RIGHT OR HAVE BUGS THAT MAKE IT NEXT TO UNPLAYABLE, THE LOGISTICS OF THIS GAME SEEM BROKEN, PRE DETERMINED DICE ROLLS, NOTHING RANDOM ABOUT DODGE , WOOD ELFS ARE JUST VICTIMS, CATCH AND RUN DOSEN'T WORK IF YOU REROLL ECT ECT, ALOT OF THESE TYPE OF GAME LABELS SEEM TO RELEASE GAMES BEFORE IT'S EVEN WORKING RIGHT, SO i THE SUCKER BEHIND THEIR FORTUNE GET A BROKEN GAME AND GET TO WAIT A FEW MONTHS BEFORE ANYTHING GETS FIXED,IF AT ALL. i WANT THIS GAME TO BE GREAT BUT IT HAS ALOT OF PROBLEMS WITH THE RANDOMIZER OR WHATEVER. THIS IS ALL IN CAPS BECAUSE i ONCE AGAIN FEEL CHEATED BY A BIG GAME LABEL
4282	0	a	Don't buy this game if you don't normally game at the native resolution of your display. The text becomes far too tiny to read and this limits your ability to tweak graphics settings for perfomance.   My XB1 controller cannot be used because for some reason the triggers are always on, that's weird.  I'd love to comment on the gameplay but I can't read anything on the screen to tell you about what's going on. If they can patch the resolution issue then maybe I can start playing.
4283	0	a	The bad:  1)turns takes forever, game could last for 30-45 mins,  2) passes are very lousy and rarely get made, 3) players only pick brawlers and teams that injure and that would be a couple of teams,  4) tutorial is very short on details, you will fail an 83% for an action,  5) passive block actions doesnt seem to work or its chances are minimal.  6) specialisation skill dont seem to matter, passers get 63% or less on pass actions, catchers get 63% or less on catch actions. The game seem to want you to only line up brawlers and take tunr punching each other hoping for stun,kill or injure roll.  the good: 1) the commentators 2) voice acting 3) animations  it seems like they got all the cosmetics right, but failed in making the game balanced or fun;; stupid game dont buy it.
4284	0	a	Welcome to the game of rolling dice, a simulator where it doesn't matter who you picked or what you do, because every decision you make comes down to whether you can roll 1d6. I played 12 games of this 'game' and let me give you a rundown of how each turn plays out. You get to move your players into positions to give them strategic advantages then fight the other team to knock them down. The most common 'advantageous' roll you'll get is 2d6 to pick one depending on what you want.  So you roll 2d6.  Double skulls. Skulls knock down your player, not theirs.  So you use one of your 'team rerolls' to change the outcome.  Double skulls. Your player falls over and your turn ends instantly.  You haven't moved anyone, or done anything. Your turn is done. The other guy then takes his turn, knocking down every single one of your team regardless of the odds. Heck, he can roll 2 dice disadvantaged and he'll 100% of the time score adouble knockdown that you can't avoid. Half of your team will be injured or KO'd in the first round and unable to play for the rest of the game which is IMPORTANT, as he now outnumbers you 11 to 5.  Now it's your turn again. Somehow get 2d6 to roll.  Roll double skulls.  Use a reroll?   Double skulls.  You're saying to yourself at this point 'wow, this guys just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥tting. What a moron this never happens to me'. I played 12 games and this happened at least once in EVERY SINGLE GAME. Did it happen to my opponents? NO. If they tried to make plays where they needed to dodge twice, each time at 17%, would they make it? 100% of the time, yes. Not a single person I played against lost more than 2 rolls in the entire match. By the time it got to game 10, I was so sick of this rng nightmare that I was conceding on the third turn after most of my team were dead or had broken legs and missing limbs while his players were at the line with not a single penalty.  I was under the impression that thinking about this game mattered in some way, but trust me, it doesn't, If I could go lower than 1/10 I would for this, but for the sake of it, lets just leave it at 1/10. Without reducing my settings to the lowest possible on quite a high end machine, the game crashed out constantly or took so long to register an action that a quarter of my turn was already wasted by the time people moved. On the first day I played, the servers were so broken it was disconnecting people midway through the match which forced both teams to concede a loss.  This game is -not- playable in its current state and I would not recomend any of you spend even £5 on something you could replicate by buying 3d6 and shoving them down your friends throat while their young children watched. £35 is like asking a poor man for 3 of his limbs to give him a cup of water, not even slightly worth it.  DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.
4285	0	a	Looked awesome. Plays out incredibly bad. Worst buy last six months at least...
4286	0	a	Does not feel like this version picked up where the last one left off as their aren't any improvements and the game is actually buggier (feels like an early beta).   After 30 hours of playtime I went right back to playing the older version which had smoother gameplay and more teams.  Avoid this version.
4287	0	a	It's amazing how the developers (Cyanide) could have only one job (translate the board game to the virtual environment), and yet still fail ... over and over and over. I mean, how many times are they going to take a shot at doing this game? For god's sake, the rules are already done--the player base just wanted a stable game. Why is that so hard to friggin' understand? WHY? WHY THE HELL DID YOU FEEL THE NEED TO CHANGE THINGS?   It defies understanding how this dev team just feels the need to stomp this IP in the dirt, repeatedly. Change the rules for no good reason? Uh ..... Add stupid things, like stadiums, and stupid rules changes? What? LoL. OK. Hell, why don't you just go and mess with the optional skill use rules and add ageing, or something ... Oh, you did that already? ROFL.  This game ... such a huge letdown. The ONLY way you could enjoy this game is if you had never played it before. Keep that in mind as you read through these reviews; you'll see a recognizable pattern emerge. 
4288	0	a	Results are very random. Too random to have have fun. Great idea, though.
4289	0	a	Runs horrible, and crashes on startup for me after changing graphic settings a bit. Poor optomization, would seriously recomend avoiding.
4290	0	a	I like Blood Bowl 2 in some respects. After investing 70+ hours into the first game, and having played the real life Blood Bowl, I pre-ordered the game. Played some people online, played the campaign, and more. There are some things to recommend about the game as well. The gameplay works as expected, and the graphics are well suited.  But there are a few things that irk me. First of all, the campaign was sold as this major ongoing plotline with new stuff happening. But it's not. First of all, the campaign is actually a tutorial. The first few games don't have certain thigns enabled, and since it takes around an hour to play a game, it's not until 4-5 hours into the game when the campiagn actualyl opens up. But then it doesn't, becuase many things happen to help you win. There are things that will kill your foes, and people that will join your squad mid game, and you are almost always given sigifcnat advantages. Also, as my team increased its BV, the opposing team never got to purchase things to make things a bit more even. With all of thse advantages (easing into the rules, various things given to you to beat your foes, and no assistance if you outrate your foes, no spirling expenses, etc) I finished the campaign after 15 hours or so, and never conceded a goal. It was never close. Therefore, the campaign, a major selling point of BB2 was a total and abject failure.  What else?  Well, I created some teams, went online, began to get some games on. Made a league for games vs the AI as well, and even released from the shackles of the campaign, the AI is poor. It can be severely exploited by knocking players into the crowd, and doesn't learn from mistakes. If I send one player into the crowd in round two, they should protect the sidelines more later on, but they don't.   While I like that I get both Lizardmen and Wood Elves from launch (Thanks!), games online are getting very repetitve very quickly. You have a 30% chance of running into an Elf team (if everyone plays all teams equally), and then Skaven are really run-ny fast too. And then you have a handful of bash teams (Chaos, Dwarf) with some middle of the road teams to finish. There's very little diversity.   One of the great things about real Blood Bowl, playing on a webiste like Fumbll, or playing in the first BB game from Cyanide is that you can play against enough teams that you never get bored. You can run into Halflings and Goblins, Undead and Norse, Ogres and Vampires. The choices for which teams made the cut staggers me a bit. Why are all three 3 core Elves (only the Pro Elf team is missing) added when not one Undead team is included? The only good thing here is the new Bretonian Team.   And with games getting very redundant, and with options to head to AI also so, and with a campaign that was a joke, I simply cannot, in good conscious, recommend this game.   Everything that's wrong is fixable. More teams, fix the campaign or add a real campaign, and such. But until that happens, Blood Bowl II just can't punch high enough to overcome it's challenges.
4291	0	a	Call it what you will, one thing you cannot call Blood Bowl is a strategy game. When the push comes to shove, this game is about little more than dice rolls. Yes, there are things you can do - using a player with X skill to attempt a particular action instead of player with Y skill, so on and so forth - ultimately though, nothing matters but the randome result of a dice roll.  Long time players tell newcomers all sorts of things ad nauseum about risk management and smart chance taking. Those players remind of the gamblers who believe they have 'a system' for winning at craps, or roulette, or keno, or slots.  There may be things you can do to slightly nudge the chances of success of failure in your favor but, in the end, nothing but the end result of the dice rolls matters and games can be won or lost on a single good/bad roll.  While that certainly fits the description of a 'game of chance' it is definitely not, a strategy game. And the dice roll essentially renders pointless any actions taken by the actual player(s). You could eliminate graphics, teams, stats etc. and just roll dice at each other for an hour or so and tally up who had the most 'good' rolls. Then have one final roll to see who won, and that's your winner.  That's Blood Bowl.
4292	0	a	First off the game takes anything good from the first game and removes it. Second the AI cheats a lot in this game. The play will always get terrible dice rolls. While the AI will get good rolls for most of the time.  The teams have some poor balance as well. With the two DLC teams being far better then the standard teams. Making the dlc feel like they are pay to win.  Good luck playing MP. First you have to sign up for a league. Then spend the next few hours hoping someone in the league will want to play. I tried many times to get into an MP game and got bored after 2 hours waiting.  I am hoping someone mades some dice mods so the game is at less playable. As right now it just a waste of money.
4293	0	a	Game is terrible. Dice rolls are ridiculous. I am convinced that the game decides a winner on the loading screen. In every single match one player gets nothing but good rolls while the loseing team receives attacker down rolls over and over and over again, regardless if you stack your players logically. One side gets steam rolled from start to finish, no matter what. The laughable random number generator isn't the only problem. Where are all the races? Oh yea they are going to charge you 10 dollars a peice for them, so be prepared to shell out at least 100 dollars for access to everything that came with Blood Bowl: Chaos Edition.   Summary: They cut half the game, forgot to test the dice, put a paint job on it, and hoped no one would notice.
4294	0	a	Forced to play out of necessity. Story is great, but other than that game sucks. Matchmaking is terrible, the 'balance' arround team level sucks, extremely random in the worst way possible.Just poor overall.
4295	0	a	Firstly, let me say that I love this game, even with it's buggy RNG, game crashes forcing you to lose and other glitches that people have pointed out already.  Or at least, let me say, I love what this game COULD be.  The most game breaking bug is with the 'Random' Number Generation which dice rolls are based on. If you play as it is now, you will lose even if you have made all the right plays and calculations simply because the game gets 'hung up' on rolling failures while the opposing team RNG is 'stuck' rolling successes.  As long as you don't mind losing a game that you by all accounts should have easily won, you'll have fun.  But if you expect the game's RNG to be accurate and reflect true statistical probability, you will probably kill yourself if you try playing it.  TL;DR  There is fun to be had leveling, but the game RNG is significantly broken. Play at your own risk.
4296	0	a	Forced to play out of necessity. Story is great, but other than that game sucks. Matchmaking is terrible, the 'balance' arround team level sucks, extremely random in the worst way possible.Just poor overall.
4297	0	a	I came into this game expecting it to be a pretty fun strategy game. It is fun, but a majority of the game just feels like dumb luck. it doesn't really matter how you play, so long as you play competent. My biggest issue is how much of a big factor RNG is in this game. It makes and breaks everything. Sure you can control some of it, but the presence of it will determine whether or not you can even have hopes of winning a game.
4298	0	a	Huge let down. I've played the first Blood Bowl 324 hours, and I loved it. It had a few bugs, but it was great. This new version is a disappointment, but it does have good things: it's nice looking and has awesome slow motion views of the hits. That's it.  And now the bad things. The user interface (generally speaking) is terrible: in many cases, you can´t tell some positionals apart (eg. dark elf linemen, blitzers, runners) and it's really annoying clicking through all your players to find the one you're looking for... Then, when you are getting hit, you sometimes don`t know which player it is, making the use of your ability Stand Firm, for example, a game of guessing if you want to use it or not. And it's terribly annoying to have to put you mouse cursor over every ability icon on the player's stat card to know what abilities he has (why not have it be text like in BB1?).   Also when playing, you don't have the sound cues you had in BB1 to know when it's your turn. It's easy to not realize, the opposing player has finished his turn and the timer is running against you...  For some strange reason, you can no longer see your team's stats (or your's as a coach). You can only see games won.  Also, for some strange reason, the rules aren't the same as in the first game (or the tabletop game): human catchers don't have the same stats, you don't have to declare a pass at the begining of the players action, etc.  And then: 7€ per race?! Come on...  Oh, and I'm Spanish but had to change the language to English; the translation is terrible.
4299	0	a	This could have been such a good game. My biggest complaint is the fact that the AI cheats. They win a majority of die rolls and the player seems to lose most. Maybe multiplayer is better, but based on the single player I have to give a thumbs down.
4300	0	a	Fix the stupid bugs. Also, the AI takes forever to make it's move, so annoying. Finally, allow us to turn off the annoying, repetitive commentators. Cannot recommend.
4301	0	a	It's pretty and fun at first until you learn the game is biased towards bashy teams and coaching an agility based team is a literal death sentence for your players.
4302	0	a	Jesus Christ, what a mess of an user interface. Another failed attempt to produce a game for console and pc, thinking pc users wont notice the obvious focus on forcing to play via controller. And even with a controller the ui sucks really bad. Anyway the people responsible for messing with controls, menus, button etc. should be ashamed. I played Blood Bowl before and loved it. This is a rip off.
4303	0	a	It's hard to recommend this game. The gameplay is great and way easier to get into than the first one. But the full game just isn't a good deal. You're paying close to full retail for 8 races/teams. Each team feels different but there aren't enough of them in the base game. Then the extra teams are coming out as DLC, which initially wasn't a big deal but it is when they cost $8 each (and the first two were pretty much day 1 DLC). So for 10 teams you're paying full retail at $60 but the game’s lack of content just doesn't warrant that. Not to mention it now has micro transactions that shouldn’t be there.   The campaign is a good way to get familiar with the game and it helps new players learn quite well, albeit slowly. The matchmaking system isn't great if you just want to play a random team, with specific match options. Then new UI is great and the animations are cool but it's just lacking too much content to justify its price (and it's DLC's). Being able to plat a local game is great as playing with someone else on the same PC is really enjoyable.   It’s fun to play and can be picked up by new players that are willing to learn but there isn’t enough here to justify the price. The full game price, day one DLC and micro transactions just shouldn’t be encouraged. I love you blood bowl but you did this to yourself. 
4304	0	a	Probably the most buggy game I ever played. Balancing is ♥♥♥♥ and even though it is based on the original BB rules, the game does not work online overall. People quit every game when they have a bad roll, and that does not really give dem any penalty. I bought the game to play online, and it just does not work...  One of the worst online games I have ever bought.
4305	0	a	Like frustration? Want to go 10 games with double skulls? Rolls are generated before the game starts, picks a winner. But give it a shot and prove me wrong. Waiting....
4306	0	a	So I bought this game over a year ago, played it for a little while and tried to return it in frustration. (I was unable to do so, due to the exceptionally long game times.) So now a year later, the bug to play again has bit me and I've given it a try.   The interface is still shoddy, glitching at times to select a command other then what you wish (IE. Stand-Up instead of Blitz when your player is on the ground). Icons on the screen bug out and repeat across the screen making it a jumbled mess at times. Finally, unless you customize skill use system, the game becomes just a bunch of random dice.  Speaking of dice, lets talk about the RNG of the game. It's utter ♥♥♥♥♥. I have spent, five turns with re-rolls (10 attempts) trying to pick up a ball on a 3+ chance (that's 67% in game terms). I own the board game, this NEVER happens in the board game. Why? Because real dice don't do this. The probability of this happening is so minute that in 25 years of owning the board game I've never seen it happen.   But if Cyanide's RNG is to be believed, it happens every game. But only to players. In a player vs player game this happens often, but vs. an AI... Well the AI never suffers such horrendous dice rolling and always gets what it needs. This is called 'Artificial Inflation of Difficulty.' Bad programmers do this rather than find a way to increase the AI's ability to play. It's a short cut used since the days of the Nintendo Entertainment System and Atari. It was used back in those days due to the size constraints on program files being what they were. You couldn't program something that complex because you on had a few MegaBytes or so to fill. This game is over a thousand times larger and more complex. Why resort to such shoddy programming?   In the end, if you want to play Blood Bowl, buy the boardgame if you can find it. Or by the original video game, the RNG is still bad but at least you won't feel like you were cheated out of $45-60 for the game plus DLC costs.  Don't buy this.
4307	0	a	It's blood bowl all right. The rules are there, and it has the fun of the board game but not much added. The commentators start to feel repetitive and not really funny after a while.  Graphics are ok, but not great at least on my rig. They seem to be quite heavy though. The single player is quite barren. You can choose from a number of league types, but there is just a series of games, not even ranking boards. Then the league just ends, no demo no trophy, just a text 'you've won'. The AI is not very good, all teams seem to just hold to the ball and they never make passes, only running touchdowns. Even an elven team will not attempt a pass, even if there would be a player free to score on the same turn. There are not too many animations, just one or two attacks per player type but no injury animations. When I played against lizardmen and they could not stop a player that was one move away from touchdown, the AI froze. Even when their time ran out their turn would not end, and I was forced to quit.  Although I like Blood Bowl, I would not recommend this game for full price. It is simply too unfinished, although I enjoyed it. I have not tested the multiplayer, it might be more fun against a live opponent.
4308	0	a	They Patch and many people cannot play and no dev responses on any fixes. Left totally in the dark, would not recommend getting, too much frustration.
4309	0	a	could not get the game to launch. constant crashing and errors. even tried uninstalling the game, and reinstalling. computer meets requirements. just aweful experience trying to get it to work and launch
4310	0	a	First one was perfect, second one needs some work. Namely a grid overlay, visable tackle zones, better camera controls. All things that the first one had. Save your money until they fix this one, or buy BB1. You'll be happier.
4311	0	a	what is the difference between BB1 and BB2? except for the the online game making. This is a bit of a scam imo...

4315	0	a	This game is not even close to being as good as the other two Blood Bowls. The interface is crap and hard to get the players to do anything even close to a correct play. Also the randomization is as bad if not worse than the previous games. On average 'go for its' fail 75% of the time or more instead of succeeding 83% of the time. Also played three games in multiplayer where my opponents never had a bad roll and with the exception of one kill I had poor to crappy rolls. Do not get this game until the Devs can make a game that is playable to both sides.
4316	0	a	To sumirze the game in one sentence.. well, 3- stebs back 1 steb foward, it improves the core in the game yet makes the dawrfs only race that is certain to survie, Skaven become almost unplayable if you want to go far with your team not to mention the irritations within the game, constant need for some odd connection to X or Y , Camera issues... and very few races are planned DLC    
4317	0	a	Missing a good portion of the teams from the first game. Just download chaos edition instead and save yourself the money.
4318	0	a	a ruff diamond in need of a lot of polishing.  update: it appears that if received both DLCs for free. i was only expecting to be getting one.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ edit; i'm still not ready to give blood bowl 2 a positive reviews simply because it is a sequel that as been released in a wurst shape than the original game. with quit a lot of basic fetchers dropped from the game like the grid and visible upgrades on your players and little details like the only cheerleaders appear to be human cheerleaders. were are the unded. orcs and skevan cheerleaders :&lt;.  still for a new players that has not played the board game ore BB1. this is certainly not a bad game. the game is fun my problem is with the lack of polish.
4319	0	a	I really wanted this to be an improvement to the first game(s), but so far, only the graphics have improved. The AI and player customisation are actually worse.  8 races is not enough for a varied experience. I'm sure more teams will be added as DLC down the line, but releasing a game at full price and adding essential elements for more money is just not okay.  Note: I have not had a look at multiplayer yet.   General comments on the AI:   - The AI still doesn't know what turn it is. It'll risk players Going For It to get closer to the End Zone in turn 8 or 16, even with no chance of scoring.   - If the AI manages to pick up the ball in an opponent Tackle Zone, they'll stop moving. No atttempts to dodge out.  - The AI will dodge out of the enemy ball carrier's TZ in order to make irrelevant blitzes or assists elsewhere.   - The setup is randomised. Yes, really. The AI doesn't set up according to your setup, it just picks a random formation. Furthermore, setting up your players is a very slow and dull affair; you have to wait for each player to run to the designated spot, one at a time. There is no need for this whatsoever.  - The AI really likes standing (or setting up) next to the sidelines. Jim and Bob are talking about why this is a really bad idea, but apparently, the AI programmers didn't listen to them. On that note, Jim and Bob look like they've been dubbed from another language; their mouth movements are just generic animations that go on while they're talking.  - Even with the improved graphics, it's harder to tell the difference between the players. The only difference between players in the same position is the head. With identical helmets, this does very little to make them stand apart.  I am very disappointed. :/

Why?! its not like they had to design levels, just a little commentator banter.  The extra Races giveaway is a step in the right direction for this game. Esp if you want it for Multiplayer.
4321	0	a	Support is dead half way to full release
4322	0	a	Someone needs to teach Cyanide what the meaning of entropy is because its apparent that this game does not implement any of it in its rolling function. Its literally laughable how nonrandom it is in its roll results. Its an epic fail second only to the poor match making that results in a higher level team decimating your squad through injuries, literally breaking it to the point of non recovery. You will purchase this game and rage quite within 10-20 matches. Sadly it could have been a lot fun and solid to play if they just let random be random rather then the crap they produced with all the rule changes from the board game. Its simply not enjoyable in its current state. I wish I could return it. Pass.  So after additional time in game(80+ hours) my review stands...this game is trash, steer clear.  update: installed agin to see if anything had changed...nope, still trash. When the rolling of a game can be so one sided that 10 player out of a 13 player team are eaither injured or KOed all with armor 8 or better...you know something is broken. Whats worse is when all of the other teams (2) KOs come back and not 1 of the 5 on the other team recover...  By the way this is an undead team...to even get 5 injured past regeneration rolls is obsurd.  Deleted this game once and for all...will never return to this trash.

4325	0	a	Okay, so people will dislike this review because it's pretty negative.  Games Workshop understands table top gaming. They know what goes into rules construction, game design, advancement methodology. But table top games don't always translate well to computer games when you make it literal.  REMOVE THE SIX-SIDED DIE. It isn't accurate, it isn't honest, it isn't true, period, the end, so long, goodbye, we're done. There are too many interconnected pieces of design, too many items that need to be weighed for this to possibly be accurate. That die is weighted, with intention, in order to reflect the other character additions of opposing teams. So stop pretending some random shmuck is going to have a 1/6 chance to get a 6 and rough up an 1800 team rank. It's complete garbage. I played 8 games as various low-level teams, maxing at maybe 1050 or so. I played another 8 games in the 1400 or so rank, and well, I declare, my rolls dramatically changed. There was a teensy tweak of strategy, but that's about it.  Remove the die. It makes people think they actually have a decent chance on plays they don't. Use a counter, a dial, something that goes to 100. That die is the most infuriating thing about this game - so infuriating, that yeah, I will give an awful review, because it acts as a carrot but is really just a big stick. Fix the die, remove the die, replace it with something that makes sense IN A COMPUTER GAME. This is a statistical game, make it some blue LED powered by Bloodweiser.  I'll likely continue trying to get better at this game, though the learning curve is not crazy, because it can be fun. But like cake, the die is a lie.  After this little deception is the artwork, which in general is great. But many times, too many times, due to the artwork meant to warn users of potential pitfalls (such as multiple dodge warnings) being opaque, they'll be hidden behind one another. You may be willing to risk an 83% dodge chance, but it's hiding a 17%. And that's when all the warnings actually appear. To say nothing of the dice rolls glitching and not displaying. This isn't a 'bad' game, but it's definitely still a buggy one.
4326	0	a	This game is not about having skill in any form, it is just about RNG, I would say if you are skilled at games then this is not for you. However if you enjoy getting rewarded for being the worst player in the world then by all means buy this game!! as it will be like heaven for you.   As a public service I will pour more hours into this game to see if it can gain a thumbs up from me but for the moment it does not.  P.S DO NOT PLAY WITH FRIENDS AS DUE TO SALT GENERATED YOU WILL HAVE NONE LEFT!!  
4327	0	a	One of the worst games I ever did play. I would share more detail but suffice to say the graphics are average, the gameplay sucks really badly, the dice rolls are really not random whatever program they used seems to not work. I think it's another game that simply hopes die hard warhammer fans will play and put up with it's medicore gameplay and styling.
4328	0	a	DO. NOT. BUY. THIS.  I was interested in it from a few videos, saw it on sale and said hey why not? Ignored the mostly negative reviews I foolishly bought it anyway. and played over 2 hours. I hope you like neverending BS and bad RNG every single game.   The playerbase is also tiny, so you'll be going up against the same OP chaos team multiple times. And if you want to play a team on chaos level that isn't chaos? Sorry the best teams like lizardmen and wood elves are behind a paywall! (Spoilers, everyone plays chaos/lizard/welves they are broken as hell!) At most if you think it looks cool, watch some videos.   Game isn't worth a dime, and the devs seem intent on being as un-userfriendly as possible with day one DLC as well in in-game mico-transaction currency.  Avoid, avoid, avoid! Do not waste your money on this trash!

4330	0	a	i have BB 1 chaos for years and i love it, time for an upgrade i thought.....BB2, 60$ with dlcs. ok lets try.....  ________________________________________________________________________________ SP: THERE IS NONE! its just an extended tutoriel  TEAMS: BB chaos have 23 teams....bb2 have 8 + 4 dlcs(at the moment, im sure they will sell you more)   MP?  i try to find a game for 30 min with a YOUTUBE TUTORIEL, because i was thinking i did somthing wrong. no game!   GRAPHICS are batter and i liked the tackle animation.   SOUND the crowd is to loud, and you cant turn it down unless you turn down all the sound effects   TY STEAM for refunding my money, its the first game i refunded ever and im a BB fan. this game is a scam.
4331	0	a	Your turns are timed even against the AI.
4332	0	a	This is nothing more than a reskin of Blood Bowl: Chaos edition. Sure, the interface has improved *slightly*, but using skills can actually be more cumbersome.  There are less teams, and any further teams that are going to be added are going to be DLC that you have to purchase.  Worst of all is that the Random Number Generator is just as ♥♥♥♥♥♥ in this as it was in their previous 3 editions of Blood Bowl. Unless you are rolling blocking dice, expect to fail about 30% to 40% of the rolls.  Complete waste of money considering I already had the Chaos Edition. Even worse was that I had to pay extra to play my favourite team: Wood Elves.  ♥♥♥♥ Cyanide, I am done with their ♥♥♥♥♥♥ games.
4333	0	a	This game would be great, if only you could turn off the slow, boring animations. It has tactical depth, good role-play elements, and an art style that appeals to me. Unfortunately, it takes maybe 2-3 times longer to play a match than it should because youre stuck watching the same boring, agonizingly sow animations play out again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again... Virtually every other turn based game ever made gives you the option of turning unit animations off because it slows the game down so much as to be unplayable. I like Blood Bowl 2. I really want to play it, but i just dont have the time or the attention span to sit through hours upon hours of boring filler animations.  The developer and fanboys are lying to your face. You can only turn off 'CUT-SCENES', NOT ANIMATIONS. This only stops the camera from zooming in on the animations, but instantaneous movement (as can be found in civ, endless legend, and HoMM) is impossible in this game. STOP LYING
4334	0	a	BB2 is a fun interactive story game. Considering how it was designed it would be inaccurate to claim it to be a strategy game considering that any strategy goes out the window with any of the numous kick off events that can literally kill multiple people on your side of the pitch or seriously effect the outcome of the game. If you want to play a game where your decisons mater, then this isn't a game for you. The best way to describe BB is that its a gambling game and no mater how well you understand the mechanics in far too many suitaitons any element of player control will be stripped from you entirely.   This paticually Blood bowl game isn't worth buying. If you have read the top and think it sounds fun then you'll want to buy Blood bowl Chaos edition, which has literally 3 times more teams and a far better UI. If you really want blood bowl 2 I'd suggest waiting for it to go down to 10$ or less, because due to the sheer lack of content in the game its not worth more then that.

4336	0	a	This game is not friendly to newbies and the matchmaker is so messed up you will be constantly paired against people considerably better than you.
4337	0	a	As much as i want to play this game i couldnt becasue i loaded into the game and it wasnt on full screen so i went into options and changed the resolution saved the game and the restarted it now i cant play the game because the mouse cursor isnt aligning with the buttons properly therefore making the game unplayable i cant even get into the options menu to change it.... yes i know you can change it in the documents but why should i have to do that? they should fix that bug and im going to get a refund on the game
4338	0	a	Just to play the obviously card - for those that haven't seen this franchise before - this is NOT a sports game - it's a turned base strategy game.  That being said and done - awesome in multiplayer - useless against the AI.  RNG against AI is set up against you - I lost a COIN TOSS against the AI - 24 times in a row.  That's 24 50/50's I 'lost'... which is statistically practically impossible (99.9998%)  So either I'm going to win the lottery or you might be better avoiding AI games.
4339	0	a	Bought it January, never managed to get it past the loading screens.   I'm running a brand new PC with up to date drivers.   Focus support is hopeless; their turnaround time for a reply to technical support queries is about one to two weeks. I think it's borderline fraudulent to relaese a game that simply doesn't work, TBH.
4340	0	a	played 3 hours plagued with endless BSOD after playing useless can't refund Blood Bowl 2
4341	0	a	AI is given too much advantage, so much so it takes any enjoyment out of the game.
4342	0	a	This game is 100% about RNG's, I've started a match and had a player instantly killed... I've had random start events where 'random players will be stunned' where all my players have been stunned, I've played an hour with 3 as the highest roll... Yes.. They you can get a advantage through level, but the RNG will ♥♥♥♥ up your game horribly. So if you're looking for something that requires skill, Go somewhere else. This game is about rage and RNG's ♥♥♥♥ing you in the face. Buy at your own risk.
4343	0	a	Constantly crashes. Not worth the hassle.
4344	0	a	An 83% chance on a 'Go For it' means chance of sucess, right? Then why does it feel more like a chance for failure?  I want to like this game FAR MORE than I do. I want to LOVE this game. I want to write a review that says 'You should go out and buy this game NAOW! o 3o '... BUT...  The RNG (Random Number Generator, used for dice rolls in this game) will make you rage something awful. This game is in an AWFUL need of a rebalance. And I don't mean the rules that the mechanics of the game follow. I mean the fact that the AI habitually gets far better rolls than you do and does so on a consistant basis. I mean that the Lizardman race is OP. And this isn't the only beef I have.  Positives: + Decent Graphics + possibility of carnage on the field + For some reason, I keep coming back to the game....  Cons: - Emotionally dead cheerleader clones. - RNG HATES YOU!! - Where are the Amazonians and Valkyries? You have icons for them in game and yet NO WORD on release date or even if you're planning to release them?  - RNG HATES YOU!!  Honestly, my main, heart breaking complaint is how unfair the RNG is. I know it doesn't sound like much, but when EVERY ASPECT of the game hinges on it? It becomes a gamebreaker. When I'm failing 8 out of 10 rolls that have a 83% chance of success, that is NOT a chance of success! And I use this as an example, but there are FAR MORE examples in the game. Players can talk all they like about positioning, skills and what not.  The only winning move is not to play.  I would recommend this game ONLY in the vain , vain hope that the RNG is addressed in the future (which is NOT likely) and that the races I am looking forward to make it to the game SOON (as of this moment, 3 new races have been announced, but none of them are Amazonian or Valkyries)  For now... get this game on sale, if you must.
4345	0	a	Constantly crashes. Not worth the hassle.
4346	0	a	Don't buy this game until it's on sale. I got it for 66% off, or something like that so it's not that bad. The base game is ok but damn dlc prices is just trying to milk us for more money. It should have been released along with the game. Damn bloodsuckers.
4347	0	a	The game is ok, good graphics and all, but the commentary is very repetetive and in campaign the dice roles are VERY stacked. I cant get past the second/third match in the campaign because my players fail ALL the roles, they fail to dodge, tackle etc. EVERY TIME. If they could make dice roles more balanced then i would recommend the game. Dont pay full price for this. I bought it in the sale for £10 and I think its not even worth that.
4348	0	a	To little strategi possibilities because the comp is to lucky
4349	0	a	Inability to run Full Screen at lower resolutions made this game unplayable on my High Res display. I could either run the game in a tiny window and squint or run full screen High Res with stuttering. Seems like a simple fix.
4350	0	a	The game feels unfinished. The graphics are updated which is nice, but otherwise I can't really say this is an improvement over BB1. Maybe in six months if they add in some of the desperately needed features, like a viewable grid/player names, toggleable skills, a working Stab for DE's, the ability to see the opposing team when buying inducements, actual graphic options where I can change my settings, the list goes on.
4351	0	a	Pros:  - it plays like Blood Bowl  Cons:  - interface is absolutely atrocious (made for a gamepad, thus megaclutter, either huge icons or microscopic text for action selection, forget about dropdown menus/scrolllists etc) - gimped team editor (especially the inability to create a team with any amount of points just to properly try out each race - like it was possible before) - inability to save the game during the match in SP, not even during kickoffs. And if for some reason you have to stop playing in the middle of the game - the game will be considered automatically lost and there's no way to replay the match. Yeah that means you auto-lose in whole leagues. - no fullscreen (seriously) thus quite possibly worse performance - graphics settings are almost non-existent (overall detail level + grass and that's it) - combat looks way duller - surrounding teammates do not throw punches anymore when close to the attacked player. Cutscenes for combat get old fast (a single animation per player class) so they don't help. Even minor thing like running across the touchdown line when you have moves left before scoring is out - it's instascore. - there are only human cheerleaders, thus no race specific ones and their number does not depend on how many your team has - only 5 stadiums. You can upgrade them visually, making them bigger - but since camera controls are gimped (only zoom in) you can't even check them out right. And since all of them are covered with the same grass - you can't even tell them apart most of the time. - only 8 races. Yeah I know it's a total remake with completely new assets yet the fact remains - Chaos Edition has 23. And 10 stadiums.  Basically - avoid until fixed (if ever) and get at a 50% discount.  TL;DR: WHAT THE F-
4352	0	a	First off this is a 20 dollar game not a 44.99 game. he price point is INSANE for what they have to offer.  Want to see the grid like bb chaos edition? nope  Want to see your player names or xp etc to help you see what player you have where? nope  Want to be able to easily tell players apart? Nope  Want to get inducements before you spend to much money on team or go back and fourth easily to construct your team? nope  Want to not have the game forget to display a dodge you have to make? Nope  Want see your opponents team before you buy inducements because he has a higher value team? Nope  Want league play to mean anything? I mean anything at all? Nope (18-0 first place, dude that has 35-1 20th.. ummhmm).  Want to see detailed stats on your players (blocks, injuries, scores)? Nope  I could go on but i'm tired. This is a downgrade from bloodbowl chaos edition. They only upgrade is the graphics are a little better and they have an online component. And honestly, zoom in to your characters to see just how crappy the skins really are. Hair is one piece that doesn't move a clips, skin is just wierd when zoomed in, players do not really look much different (dwarves in particular), player doesn't look any different as he levels up.  On a steam sale for 20 bucks this is a solid buy. for 44.99 no way it is worth it.
4353	0	a	The game is not ready by any stretch of the imagination. Horrible interface, really thin campaign mode, lack of features in-game such as useful stadium upgrades and sponsors that do anything. Not to mention the awful server issues that causes you to lose everything you gained from hour long matches. Even if you manage to level up players in your team, you need to beg that you'll get connection with the server back, or else you'll have to start all over again.  Why even release it at this point. It's far from polished, I've seen early access games that are better.
4354	0	a	While the graphics are terrific and the gameplay itself is fun to watch, there are multiple issues around actually PLAYING the game itself. I won't go over the issues with multiplayer as they are better described in other reviews. I want to focus on the 'single player' game. I have played Blood Bowl the board game since second edition. I am a Wood Elf player and was really looking forward to practicing with the solo league play. The problem is that the AI is so unbalanced that it is beyond broken. In my first four games, my team has suffered FOUR deaths! I have seen repeated successes for the AI on rolls of 33% or less while receiving a losing streak of no less than 8 fails on rolls having an 83% chance of success. And this is after I started tallying rolls for both sides. I happen to HATE games where unbalanced die rolling compensates for lazy AI coding. It is quite obvious this was to be a multiplayer only experience as it is equally obvious they gave the AI coding minimal effort. DO NOT BUY! Instead wait for the 5th Edition to be released by Games Workshop later this year and play the game it was meant to be played.  *edited for typos*
4355	0	a	Game is fun but unfortunately ruined by the fact there is basically nothing but Chaos teams. Perhaps when Balancing is actually implemented in some way the game might be worth playing  Lizardmen Edit: 6 Linemen with 4 strength, Worse than Chaos
4356	0	a	A graphics job on the original.  Interface is less usable and the camera is just clumsy at best.  Campaign is human and on rails. You don't even get to choose your team. Seeing Jim and Bob is a nice touch.  8 teams only, this feels like a late beta or something.
4357	0	a	Graphics engine needs some maturity. Poor\sluggish performance on new HP Omen system. May likely be fixed via update, but till then the game is unplayable in multiplayer mode. In addition, the single player mode is very limited compared to Bloodbowl 1.
4358	0	a	Annoying as hell, the computer cheats and no in the sense of roll's and such i believe is just luck but when you play a league...the computer is supposed to have a team value of say 1000 the same as you...except they have waaaay too much for this to be the case. They will always have a higher value team as the computer seems to have limitless petty cash and hires star players and always has at least as many rerolls as you. The further you go on, the more out of hand it gets.  Original was fair, this is just meh.
4359	0	a	WORST GAME OF THE YEAR!!!!! I love how it calls it self a strategy game with no real strategy component in it, its like playing chess and having your queen, as she is taking a pawn be crushed because its raining........ the pawn then turns into a second queen for the opponent. No game coder to date has written random code worth two ♥♥♥♥♥s. It's a flip of the coin game, the difference is you have to wait 50mins to see the winner. No real AI, the coders have written in comp ability to rig the dice when needed, what else can be said for the greatest let down of 2015  Get this, i start a team, the kick off happens and a 'RANDOM' event happens which Stuns 8 out of 11 from my team, then the other player knocks my blocker out and kills him, so not only do i loose the game but loose the best player as well, the GAME IS COMPLETE GARBAGE! random chance my ♥♥♥........................................................................................................................................................................................ Im so angry at steam for letting this ill conceived SH%* stain of a game be sold and Games workshop for allowing one of FFSboard games to be brutally invisioned. A sign of the times, a complete waste of time.....
4360	0	a	If you can accept the terrible RNG then maybe you'll like this game. Half of my turns were all forfieted because of turn-overs.
4361	0	a	Issues:  Game claims to have controller support...it has ♥♥♥♥ poor controller support at best. Idk about you...but when i pick up a controller and collapse onto the couch...controller support means I can get everything needed done...from the couch...with a controller...I should be able to launch the title from big picture...play it, exit it...without any issues causing me to use the keyboard and mouse.  Also is it me or is it impossible to run this full screen?...I cannot get this game to launch full
4362	0	a	Performance is awful,  Creating your own campaign is gone , instead your forced into an online league with bots or other players.   You can't even turn the camera to see what your guys look like.  No graphic options  Just a failed wannabe console game .
4363	0	a	I would say this game is about 80% luck and 20% skill. I understand you can take steps to minamize your risks, but it doesn't matter what your strategy is if the dice decide to f**k you. Cannot recomend this game if you are into strategy games. If RNG based results are your thing then go for it.
4364	0	a	4 teams as dlc in almost a year to slow.
4365	0	a	In a nutshell: 1 step forward (graphics), 2 steps back (everything else which was already available in BB1). The typical downgrade in order to please the Console crowd. Cheap money grab...
4366	0	a	There really should be a warning on the store page for games that rely on micro-transactions.
4367	0	a	Having suffered through the terrible interface and non-intuitive controls of the blood bowl chaos edition, I was looking forward to using a cleaner, newer, improved client. However, what we got is this pile of half polished turds.   Dissapointing. I'd pay $5 for this, and even that is pushing the limits.
4368	0	a	to much rng=bad review
4369	0	a	What they cannot make up for in gameplay or programming they just out and out screw you when you play. I loved the first edition of BB. Don't waste you time with this one.
4370	0	a	Same problems as always. Game looks good but as expected so called random dice rolls are always in favour of one team. You can tell within 2 turns who will win a game which makes it no fun. Loved the table top game as it did require tactics and and bit of luck with this you need none. The one sided rolls takes all enjoyment out the game. Quite possibly the worst blood bowl game I have ever palyed plus no sportsmanship from most people that play it. NEVER BUY this game!!!!
4371	0	a	just too much rng... it's pointless to plan ahead because every single turn rng will most likely screw you hard. so hard that it will give your opponent a free win for no reason at times  no thanks.
4372	0	a	I really want to like this game, but as it stands the graphic options and graphics card support isn't quite on the mark. optimization does'nt seem up to par for lesser pc's and since their isn't really anything special happening on screen, I wonder what exactly is taxing my lower end machine!
4373	0	a	Played for less than 6 hours, and very disappointed - too many hours to get a refund from Steam...  Win or lose, it's random. Like playing Monopoly. Also slow. Graphics are nice, sure. Commentators are irritating ad nauseum. Really wanted it to be fun, cool... but just slow, tedious, fail a dice roll, lose. Table top might be fun, with your mates, a bag of chips, a sixpack of your fav brew, some laughs. Not on PC though.
4374	0	a	Cons ! Percentages of action success means nothing, You very often fail on Ball Catching when is 80%+, chance, Pass 80%+, Shadowing 70%+, Dodge 80%+, Tackle 67%+ and 80%+. Abilities when it comes to % are completely broken and everything feels so random! Along with the dice rolls which begin to go against you the moment you get a break (score or have the upper hand in player numbers) make this game really frustrating. Either fix this % issue or display actual percentages.  1. Game crashes/freezes very ofter, on campaign and on league. 2. Complete absence of difficulty level on the 'story mode' : Campaign. 3. Dice rolls seem to go against you when you got the upper hand (when you got more players on the field or winning) 4. Game seems to be laggy between turns and certain actions. 5. Funds are extremely limited on league. You often end up with teams full of linemen just to get by. 6. Annoying the fact that you have to pay extra for the dlc's. 7. Campaign is on the whole linear, it is actually a a tutorial. The absence of other scenarions or campaigns makes thos game easy to get bored with. You may only play that one human team and you haven't got any variery of options. 8. Dice rolls tend to go against you when you start having the upper hand, down enemy players or scoring. 9. Resources are clearly not adequate on League, you can have 2 dice reroll cards sacrificing better team players only to go against teams of equal strength with 4 dice reroll cards... Team players on many teams are bit expensive (10-20k off each player would ease the discomfort.  Pros 1. Beautiful designed teams, but your are limited on how many types of players (team setup) you may have on roster. 2. Commentators are really funny and it is the most pleasant thing in the game. 3. Interesting gameplay, sadly it is the only one of it's kind and frankly I am forcing my self to like it more than I should. 4. If you compare this with Xcom2 then this game should be sold about 15 bucks.
4375	0	a	BB2 is not completely bad especially is you start learning to play. But for others player who were already on the previous version, BB2 is very frustrating. I can understand that there is not 23 teams they have to sell their game and make money but there is so many useful options missing from chaos edition. And it is difficult to understand why they remove them?? As a lot of players I think I miss stuff like: the grid, display name on the player, create your team more easily (buy re roll), stats of the team player easier to read, free camera, ability to look the composition of the opposite team before choosing inducements, chat lobby... Also personally missing cosmetic stuff like: more colour option (I want to do my All Blacks team), more option for create player (not just head), level up change appearance like in BB1, specific cheerleaders, crowd in stadium more diversity (not only one type of men and ork), in-game chat commentaries of the IA (it is nice in BB1CE)... So if you are a hard core player of Blood Bowl stay on BB1CE which is the better version until now!  Cyanide faite des patchs pour ameliorer le jeu, qu 'il soit au meme niveau de contenue et option que le precedent, s'il vous plait ! Sinon le jeu est tres jolie, ingame et l'interface.

4377	0	a	+ Looks/sounds good + Fun concept  - The campaign is the tutorial which is too long to get to know everything - Apparently it went from 22 teams to 8 teams between the previous game and this one. Want more teams? Buy the DLC lmao - Sponsors have no effect? Is this unfinished or intended?  6/10 -24/10 if you dont like RNG  
4378	0	a	So many bugs spoils what looks too be a good game. So frustraiting
4379	0	a	my screen displayed my mouse in a position it wasnt and thus couldnt tell where to put my mouse and couldnt get through the opening kickoff of the tutorial or change the game resolution (1/16/16)  UPDATE soon after I posted this review netheros helped me fixed my problem, I had refunded the game and have not yet purchased the game back yet will update again after that happens(3/24/16)
4380	0	a	I would not buy this game. most of the time it doesnt even open, and when it does no matter how strong of hardware you own, it still only opens as a small minimized screen. The game is great on console but I would NEVER recommend to anyone that they purchase it for PC online. 0/10 worst steam experience ever!
4381	0	a	The game wont even go past the main title screen, as the Enter button doesnt seem to work in the game. Anybody else have a similar problem? A shame really and a waste of money. 
4382	0	a	in my opinion you shouldnt be giving every damn race a 3 for strength, if one race is supposed to be stronger than another, MAKE THEM STRONGER, a scaven lineman should not have the ability to run 2/3 of the field and be as strong as an orc, ive had back to back games where all my roles where complete ♥♥♥♥, and even using my 5 reroles, they got even worse. orcs are the strongest and are slow, chaos injures easier but cant play the ball as well, skaven should be weak and very fast, and so on, as an avid fan of Warhammer and warhammer 40k thiese stats are nowhere near what they should be (if you couldnt tell im saying the skavenneed to be nerfed, because if i have 3 guys surrounding him and then blitz him, i should not get skulls both before and after the rerole)
4383	0	a	Keep an eye on this game but at the moment it honestly feels unfinished, as many other commenters have put, its got some good features, refine UI better graphics etc. but the weirdly lacking options menu, the inability to have a campagin with a team of your choice (humans only), and lack of effort like all spectators being the same model with the same face in different coloured vests, there aren't race specific cheerleaders anymore either, just feels like a great game is in development but was rushed out the door, even the preorder bonus teams aren't available. And an example of why I (really hope at least) that its going to be updated, is its even lacking things as simple as animations on grounded playered, Blood Bowl had it, in this as soon as a player is knocked down they become a totally unmoving 3d model, which is suprisingly noticable.  Bottom Line its ok like a 6.5/10 would be a 9 with some polish, currently not worth it vs buying the chaos edition of blood bowl 1 for considerably less money last time I checked  But for me its definately put me off pre ordering anything from this studio again.  Mid April Update. The developers promised the first of the additional races, out at the end of Febuary, then end of March, we are now into week 3 in April and not only no new teams but not even an update since 7th March. This game feels more and more like abandonware and I'm starting to think it will take the release of all 4 teams along with the resignation and suicide of all those involved in the delays will be required to ever make people forgive this joke of a studio. I will revise my statement from my earlier review I not only will not preorder anything from Cyanide again. I doubt I'll even buy anything by them.
4384	0	a	The game sadly came out with a lot of issues I'll list the good and the bad  PROS:  *The game runs smoothly (How ever requires DX11, despite system requirements saying otherwise *The UI has been vastly improved since the first game *It's fun  CONS:  *The AI on all races is horrible. They play terribly, even a new player (Which I was) Can annihilate the AI, even when they have a better team. *There's near no dialogue in-game, despite a heavy focus being on the commentators of the game. *The animations are very repetitive, on the starting line-up you will often see everyone in the exact same pose, barely moving at all.  *The animations are repetitive and aren't indicitive of anything in-game. *The art in-game is very low poly and low-res, yet the game forces you to be direct x11 compatible (Which means Windows 7 users can't play this game) *The game sells each pack of characters at around $10. It's a blatantly bad way to handle dlc, especially so early in. *The campaign is extremely short and half-♥♥♥♥♥. *Multiplayer matchmaking is added terribly in this game. Your opponent is random, there's no shaping to skill. You can only battle people within your own league, which is basically a group you join. It's a horrible system that makes the game terrible to play if you don't have friends, or good luck on who you fight. *The game is basically the first game again, I usually don't have this complaint about this, but I'm upset in this case.
4385	0	a	Much worse than Bowl Chaos edition. The UI is terrible and prone to missclicks. You can't blacklist players, so If a players gets angry because he's losing a game he just has to leave the chair and make you until every turn ends. You're also exposed to insults.  Graphics are mediocre (all expectators look the same) and you have too few races to begin.
4386	0	a	no proper fullscreen mode. i have 4k desktop but game at 1080. it's unacceptable to force people to change their desktop resolution for 1 game or run game at 4k for no good reason.
4387	0	a	Crashed as soon as it loaded into start screen.
4388	0	a	Blood Bowl 2 is good for what it brings you but i still cant say it was worth the price now this is comming from someone who owns and has played the original game and i must sadly say that there is less content in BB2 the the original the campaign has a Intro that is way to long compared to the small size of the campaign at 40% complete it finally lets you play whitout telling you new things so tutorial finally over i am currently at 60% done at the time i write this and the one thing i dislike about the campaign the most is there is only one team why give us 7 save slots for one team i cant recomend this game until more content is added there is some good PvP but no PvE witch was fun and intresting to do in the original i play the PvP and the PvE but sometimes you just cant deal whit running into hardcore players that cant enjoy the game and just act childish but sadly there is nothing othere then the campaign   i am not saying that the whole campaign is ♥♥♥♥ the story it has is poor but the actors comments are amazing and realy well dont
4389	0	a	BB1 was better in every single way. No visual upgrades in BB2 Less races No more cheerleaders 
4390	0	a	On balance it is actually better than the previous versions of Blood Bowl, and I have been playing it a lot, and enjoying it. The problem is it's not MUCH better.  The UI is improved in many ways, but in some ways it's also worse. The whole thing feels like it's two steps forward but one step back.  I could not recommend this game to anybody who is not a hardcore Blood Bowl fan.  Most glaring issues include (but are not limited to):  Key re-binding menu is grayed out and currently un-usable. Game still feels like it's in alpha.  Has nothing like the level of player, rule, and UI customization that Blood Bowl Chaos Edition had.  I really, REALLY miss the old campaign mode. Single player 'Campaign' is a tutorial where you can only play as the Reikland Reivers, which is fine for what it is, and fairly well done, but the old Campaign mode let you make your own team and play seasons and was actually my preferred way of playing the game in Blood Bowl Chaos Edition.  With graphics settings all at full game looks very nice indeed, but will ♥♥♥♥ing murder your PC. With graphics settings on anything but maximum the game looks worse than Blood Bowl Chaos Edition. Demand on hardware seems excessive for the end result, suggesting little to no optimization.  For more information see this youtube video by cKnoor, King of Blood Bowl:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WhKiQF0PL8   Issues that have now been fixed (I will extend this list as development continues, and change my thumbs-down to a thumbs-up when it seems good unto mine eyes):  Now option to display player names and other information over the players heads, like you could in Blood Bowl Chaos Edition.  Now able to turn off subtitles for commentators.  Now option to turn grid on, like you could in Blood Bowl Chaos Edition.  The 'End Turn' button is now in a slightly less ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ place.  There are now more than 4 teams to play as, and all have been free, no DLC charged as of yet.  Lizardmen and Wood Elves have both been added to the accounts of those who pre-ordered.  The 4 new races currently planned for DLC are going to be free if you already own the game.  Kthanxbai.
4391	0	a	Wait till the game has a 'Chaos Edition'. And the removal of Blitzmode is a huge insult to the playerbase!
4392	0	a	I want to like this game, but it is so frustrating. Been playing all day and this game is very frustrating.   I've probably failed 90% of the times the game told me I had a 83% chance to succeed. In almost every game I played, the RNG determined that I would lose in the first 3 turns. Either from failing to pick up the starting kickoff 3 times in a row, having 3 injuries and 2 KOs on my team by turn 2, or from players tripping on the grass and dieing.  I tried starting a lot of new teams in multiplayer but almost every single game it thought a fresh team would be great to match up with someone about 200 points higher with more abilities and experience.  Glad I bought this elsewhere for $30 instead of paying $45 for it on steam. Not worth that much, wait for a sale unless you're really into Blood Bowl.
4393	0	a	As someone who has played Blood Bowl since the late 80's and actually loved the 'Chaos' edition, I thought this game would be can't miss, so I pre-ordered it with no doubt that it would be great. I was wrong. Despite wanting to love the game, it's awful. If you aren't already a Blood Bowl fan, avoid this game at all costs. If you are a Blood Bowl fan, and feel you must buy a Blood Bowl game - Buy The Chaos edition. That 4 year old game is much better than this.
4394	0	a	Wow. Just... wow. Worst AI in the history of AI. The AI has absolutely no code in place for any of the basic premises of BB, with the exception of the occasional cage. Absolutely horrible. On top of this, they removed the flexibility to set your own rules... and they try to make up for their pathetic AI by just gifting the teams in solo leagues hundreds of thousands of coins so they can buy top Star Players for every match against you, even if they don't have the money. Yay.  Truthfully, I cannot ever recall being this disappointed by a game. Cyanide should hang their heads in shame.   &lt;edit: I've continued to push further into the game, in hopes of finding redemption. I find little. While I still will play because I love BB, it is an almost entirely mindless exercise now. I've had the AI score a total of 1 (yes one) touchdown against me in now about 25 games. The only positive thing I can say is that it doesn't appear to cheat. Huzzah.&gt;
4395	0	a	I have 3000+ Hours of Blood Bowl 1, more then 2000 matches, i run several succesful leagues.   I really can NOT recommend this unless they improve several things.  I could argue why but honestly iam to lazy and after 4 years watching Cyanide/Focus doing their work they clearly dont care about their users at all. They dont communicate, they implement rules oit of the blue without involving players who have been accumulating data from thousand of matches. They never finished one of their previous THREE Versions. All buggy all unfinished. Same thing with Dungeonbowl and dont get me started about 'BB Star-Coach'. I hope they start communicating with their customers and they really implement features from BB1 THAT WORKED GREAT and now they cut them for no reason (Leaguemanagement, Grid, Enemy inducements scouting ect!!!)  GO BUY BB1 (legendary edition or Chaos edition) cheaper, more teams, less bugs more fun.  I ran a league with almost 150 coaches now if you really imrove some of those things mentioned iam gonna be your greatest advertisemnt champion til then good luck.
4396	0	a	I bought the game a while ago and have now had two periods trying to enjoy the game, but I just can't. I like stratergy games and building things up and mastering things and enjoying it alomg the way, but it's so frustrating that your tactics and choices along the way all depend on one thing only as to wheather they are sucessful or not, and that is a dice roll. luck of the dice. keep rolling double skulls your tactics fail and your turn is cut short leaving you exposed as you were unable to counter all the moves the opposing team made, keep rolling hits or what you need and you'll be successful. no skill just luck of the dice.
4397	0	a	I am basing this review on my own experiances, because I understand that there are those who may not have had such a negative time with this game as I have. First off, This game is truly an amazing and fun game when, well, it wants to be. Matches only have two turnouts: Either the opposing team gets COMPLETELY screwed by 'rng' or your team gets COMPLETELY screwed by rng. There is such a low level of strategy and skill in this game that such a brutal rng system really hurts the game at times. I am talking, turn 1, You injure two of your enemies immediately and stun another and knockdown the rest. While that will be fun for you, the other player is probably bashing their head against the wall. Vice versa, turn 1, your strongest player has a 3 dice roll, and gets 3 skulls. Reroll and get 3 MORE skulls. Those rng chances seem like they would only happen once in a blue moon, but they truly happen essentially every game. At this point you are probably thinking, 'Man you probably just suck git gud'. Well, maybe you are right, but rng aside, the games teams aren't exactly balanced either. The game basically consists of Chaos, Elves, and Lizardmen. Any other race stands no chance against their versatility and stopping power. Norse are a heavy contestant but just not good enough at times. The matches are either incredibly long winded or instant concedes. I have had this game since launch and only recently reinstalled this rage fest, to discover, I am uninstalling it again. Your only chances of enjoying this are if you have a HIGH HIGH tolerance to rage, or you are an extreme masochist and enjoy the agony of devastating rng. But, for me, it's a no. I'd give it a 6/10. Buy it on sale to try it, but never full price.
4398	0	a	Purchased the game with high hopes as I thoroughly enjoyed the previous edition, sadly this was a disappointment as the gameplay is so drastically different from the original, and from the board game that I know and love, that this shouldn't have the name 'Blood Bowl' associated with it at all. From no visibility to what block dice you rolled (for those times when maybe a both down is better than a pushback), nor any option to either follow up, nor pick where your opponent goes, this game may have potential for fun, but it really isn't Blood Bowl.  What's a crying shame is that the graphics are an improvement, Jim and Bob are vastly improved and the campaign mode felt like it had a real story to get going but being forced to play humans, with no option to change to a different team, nor pick things like re-rolls (or at least no obvious way to do so!), it will get dull really quickly.  Frankly, if you like Blood Bowl, avoid this game and get the previous edition instead.
4399	0	a	I complained about the game too but its fine having fun with it miss nurgle   heres somethings wrong wth it   the ui is terrible  no freecam ????????   No armor upgrades! WTF my guy looks like a lvl1 at lvl 3   Bugs sometimes u dont see the dice  sometiimes game crashes blah blah check if your grapics card is upgraded    END TURN BUTTON WTF IS IT ON THE FIELD   Sometimes u get a 1 dice when u should be getting 2.............................................  Names pos on players i have to click on all of them to see which is which   No nurgle   Quiters most games punish people that quit ....... so 2 ppl got KO i quit!  Dwarfs op   people using hacks seen 1 so far   No dice chat like bb1   No grid   when u go for a run and pass u cant see what % u got for pass until u do  it...............WTF?   No chat in lobby   probably more but thats it for now!      these things seem like they will get fix but u can play bb1 which is better atm say i say NO IMO    well i came back fater a couple of months minor fixes only    and yet it somehow feels worse with less players playing this game you will now match up with alot higher teams that you will not have a chances against.  the suppose fix avoid this is to join a private league that a casual new player wont.
4400	0	a	I felt a strong need to review this game due to the fact I feel live I've been ripped off yet again by games workshop. Yes I enjoy playing against my friends when the seldom opportunity arises, but I find that playing against the computer - the dice are rigged against you. I've read a lot into this and consistant contradicting arguments have arisen. I personally find that the computer AI is really bad, so I always win games. But my players seem to get knocked down, injured, and just about every negative aspect - all when it should have a high probability of success. And then the computer succeeds on really low chances. Also they always seem to have more re-rolls than I can ever work out how to get!? So yes I can win the matches quite easily against the computer AI, but it's not enjoyable to play. Just because of the sheer price of this game - I would highly NOT recommend just for the multiplayer function. Literally you're just paying for a graphics upgrade really... and less teams. The grass doesn't make up for gameplay. Sorry.

4403	0	a	- Can't save during matches, god forbid that you can't sit on a game for 2 hours to finish a game without interuption, or if the game randomly crashes.  - Players forced into retirement because of Online balancing in multiplayer or some such, even if you don't want to play online. Basically your players will be lost forever after a certain amount of games and you will have to rebuy new ones with no levels.  - AI has suspiciously good dice rolls pretty consistantly. No doubt this is deliberate as to make the game more 'challenging'.  Infuriating pretty much all around. Buy on sale if you buy at all, definately not worth the full price. Alternatively, play Blood Bowl: Chaos Edition. Same dodgy rolls but far less of these idiotic new mechanics they have added in.
4404	0	a	Game looks good and campaign is fun with lots of humor and a good buildup to learn the mechanics of the game on the acctual pitch. However, the multiplayer system with leagues and teambuilding is extremly poorly constructed and with little or no help for the player to understand how it works or with suggestions on how to play multiplayer.   I also personally dislike the part where your players can die, not just die in a game and respawn later, die, for real, gone forever. There's too much of that in the real life, in this sence I prefer games to be unrealistic with at least options to resurrect, or whatever.  If you have some extra cash and like this type of strategy game you might wanna buy this but in my view this game is not worth the money they charge for it, I'd say it worth a maximum of 10 USD.
4405	0	a	Every single dice roll and random occurence will go in favor of the computer at all times to make up for terrible low quality A.I.   Terrible programming and lazy design at its finest. I regret this purchase.
4406	0	a	Like the first one but just more expensive
4407	0	a	This game can not be recommened because Team Value means nothing. Purely nothing. A Chaos team can have a TV under 2000 with a level 5 minotaur, 3level 4 goats, and not a single level 1 team member? Hell the chaos warrior was level 3. No balance to this game at all. ZERO BALANCE. CAn be lots of fun but gets ruined very fast with unbalanced ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.   THE OTHER BIG THING is that there is no real incentive to win a match. Losers get paid only slightly less than the winner. And they both only get one MVP. So there is nothign to stop bashy teams just standing around trying to kill you. And at higher team levels, that is a real problem.
4408	0	a	Bad control system. The camera is so bad you literally can't see all of the necesary playing space without zooming it all the way out. Full of bugs (or bad programing, I'm not sure). The 'random' dice rolls are anything but random. The game sends you on WILD wining streaks and then just as wild loosing streaks.
4409	0	a	I've given this game so many chances, it's pure frustration every time. There's just nothing fun about getting beaten by a dice role. The concept is fun and compelling but the crushing weight of the luck factor makes actually playing it feels like being the victim of some kind of hidden camera prank. You'll get ♥♥♥♥ed over time and time again because your players are incapable of picking up a ball lying on the ground, then see your opponent scoop up the ball, dance pass all your blockers, then chuck it down the field for an easy touchdown. Then once you've lost, feel the magic of playing a game of equal or greater difficulty with half of your players injured or dead. I seriously regret paying money for this game, it has provided an exclusively negative gameplay experience.
4410	0	a	I can't recommend this game at this time. I felt like this is one review I had to do. I love Blood Bowl. This game however is nothing to love. Games Workshop makes money and produce games that look like they were made ten years ago. No camera controls, no full screen options. Hell most common options aren't so common in this wireframe launch. Average game length is close to two hours. You gain injuries and deaths faster than you gain the money to replace players. Most of the 3 dozen or so games I've played end after only a few turns because the game has already thrown one player everything they need to win while killing off half the oppostion team. Since it's less expensive to delete your team and start fresh there is no incentive to continue playing if anything at all goes wrong for your team. Just start over and hope the game decides to give you everything that round. The very few games I did finish scored 2-1 or so but the difference in SPP from those games was more like 25-4. So if you're not winning by a lot you're gaining nothing while wasting almost 2 hours of your life.   I did say I love BB and I do. But not this game. I want more ppl to be playing it so I'll have less down time between games, but I don't hate anyone enough to actually recommend they pay money for this turd. It's a joke that looks like GW kept it in the closet ten years too long.
4411	0	a	Where are my lizardmen? No rebindable keys on the main menu and mouse or gamepad for the pc? Gamepad? Sorry, I'm on a PC. Sure, some people use a gamepad for more action orientated games, but seeing how this is a... oh, right. It's a port.   No configurable graphics options. Heh.   So many other glaring issues or missing things from this compared to Blood Bowl. Yes, it took DLC for Bloow Bowl to have all their races and such, but that is a ♥♥♥♥ poor excuse to use as a crutch for not implementing at least what was in latest version of Blood Bowl. I'm not going to bother listing what is missing or what I'm specifically unhappy with as Cyanide Studios doesn't have much of a rapport with their community as it is.   First game refund for me. Where are my lizardmen you dirtbags!?
4412	0	a	Compared to Blood Bowl 1, this game feels painfully slow.  The UI and field visualisaion is horrible, even for an experienced player. The cut scences (which can be toggled off) become tiring after 2 minutes and even Jim and Bob's commentary started repeating after a couple of plays.  
4413	0	a	All the game seems to be is about luck and even then you dont seem get any of it. its a rage indueing game, not one i could consider fun
4414	0	a	If you would like to rip your hair out at this broken RNG, Try blood bowl :)
4415	0	a	looks good but thats all it has going for it. gameplay is boring!
4416	0	a	High price for mediocre sequel
4417	0	a	Game is a step backwards for the franchise. The graphics were improved, that's about the only 'pro' compared to the last game. The rest are 'cons.'   The 'campaign' is a glorified tutorial where you can play one team in a series of tutorial matches, most of which are tedious. Major clipping issues, pointing to lazy animation work. Customization of players is still a joke (choose from 9 heads for 16 different players, et cetera), star players share the same exact models/heads of your line players, no difference visually. That's unacceptable. The voiceover commentating was repeating itself wiithin the first 15 minutes of the game.   I'm really scratching my head, wondering what Cyanide spent their development time on, because I just don't see it.
4418	0	a	what the hell have cyanide done, this game is full of bugs and is clearly not finished, why release something in this state. The controls are clunky and akward the camera is useless there is so many little bugs i'm not even going totry to list them and for some reason its in a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ little window and i can't find an option to change it.  plus side graphics look good i think im going to return this game and maybe re buy it in 6 months when its actually finished
4419	0	a	High price for mediocre sequel
4420	0	a	I really cbf going into detail why I don't like this game, so I'll leave it to just that- I don't like the game. Nice graphics though.
4421	0	a	Fancy graphic's don't make a game  Unless you simply must play the official e-sport leagues, I wouldn't bother with BB2 it's a classic example of making a game worse for the sake of fancy pixels and loosing a lot of what makes blood bowl great
4422	0	a	Single player campaign's WAY too diffcult and frustrating. The AI very obviously cheats the rolls. Failing three 87% rolls in a row. . . yup. . . done.
4423	0	a	Single Player was pointless, multiplayer wasn't much better.
4424	0	a	To parrot what most people are saying: The game looks and plays well. The campaign is a joke and restricted to humans only. There are only 8 races available. Wait a year when it's on sale/has more content.
4425	0	a	DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF EPIC GARBAGE  Absolute trash. The rolls are complete and utter garbage. No matter what, against the AI, you always roll like trash when you need to at least roll something! It never fails, and then the AI will roll and pass all these silly things over and over and over. Do I recommend this? H E L L no. I wish I could refund this garbage. I would rather play any other game besides this. The RNG is by far the absolute worse I have ever saw in ANY game I have ever played. HATE this game  -----EDIT-----  I have now played this game even more and besides the sh!t campaign (that is just basically a tutorial on how to play and is utter garbage), I am yet to win a single game against the AI. No matter what I tried, no matter what team I used, it was pointless. Why? Because the AI and its bull sh!t rolls non stop.  I had games where I would get my turn, move, get a sh!t roll, and end my turn before I could do a single thing (this is what usually happens). Then, when I was able to do something, I would get stupid rolls and only be able to push the AI around and on their turn, they would knock my @$$ to the grouond, stun me, or injure me every time. The game favors the AI so heavily that it is just stupid-silly. 'Well then don't play the AI, play a Human!' No thank you. I do not like playing online games against other players, especially since to compete you would need to have a team with some experience... well, you can't get experience if your team gets slaughtered every f*cking game.  This game is so aweful and I am so p!ssed that I spent money that I can not get back. This is by far the worse RNG game I have ever played. I though World of Tanks and Mordheim City of the Damned were bad. HA! Those games are childs play compared to this piece of sh!t. If I could, I would GIVE this game to someone.
4426	0	a	Frustrating and poor gameplay result constant screaming as 1:32 chance for a player of rolling snake eyes never happens for the AI but happens frequently too you. The game as a result of cheating will turn your almost certian victory into a defeat in single turn. How does it cheat:  - Real probablities not correctly reported - Real probablities not even correctly observed by AI, pre-cacluates success and failure and will occasionally not even make the move in failure knowing the future. Would you still take the move or undo if you knew it was going to fail? - Pre-Match, AI spends money it doesn't have - Rules of Turnover extreme to the point that AI exploits to get out of losing or securing a win  Unfortunatly it take's more than the 2 hour refund policy :( to figure that out and is not from a lack of skill. Avoid this game
4427	0	a	Game doesnt feel finished... got refunded. :(
4428	0	a	Like most reviews have already said this is not an upgrade from the original. So much content is missing. Not just the other races but the visuals are lazy. The campaign is a tutorial and a really boring and bad one. Its unwatchable. The commentators repeat themselves over and over after the first 15-20 mins of the match. Got to a point where i just turned it off.  Overall don't buy this product unless they really make a show to improve the game. The lazyness of its release and what looks like a money grab with its price and DLC ...well BEWARE TO BUYER
4429	0	a	No (fun) single player options  -You can play Campaign but all this is is a tutorial and you HAVE to play humans.  -Can't play single player ladder.   As crisper as the graphics are this game is a HUGE step back from BB1 and was simply developed as a money grab (they only released a handful of races, you'll need to buy the rest as DLC).   PLEASE DON'T ENCOURAGE THEM BY BUYING THIS GAME, PLAY BB1. By being fooled into buying this game you are essentially promoting this money grab tactics by gaming companies. I'm submitting for a refund and you should do the same.
4430	0	a	So is this it? the create a campaign in blood bowl chaos edition was awesome. i could make my own team and play in different leagues single player. i dont want to play online, please fix this asap. other then that i do love the graphics and gameplay, I did read through many discussions and for this game to be built towards what the fan base wants... a good 70% want a better single player not multiplayer and i defenitly don't want to play a pre build, one pathed campaign. This is the most expensive game i have purchased in a long time hopefully i dont have to regret it because now it is going to sit on my computer barely played until you fix single player
4431	0	a	It seems like a step back from BB1.
4432	0	a	Unplayably terrible UI. Just total crap.
4433	0	a	1) The newbie barrier to entry is rather big. NO TUTORIAL. There is no tutorial for this game. The game rather assumes that you are a competent BB player and know pretty much all the rules.  There IS NO TUTORIAL FOR MOVING YOUR UNITS, TACKLING, BLOCKING... well, there is no tutorial.  Many (most?) games have a tutorial which show you, with help text, how to.  You watch/play this tutorial once or twice in your life (or more, up to you, until YOU feel comfortable with the UI) to learn the mechanics of the game and then you move on.  But then again, the same mouse action has DIFFERENT results (double clicking on a piece to stand up either stands it up or pops up an extremely small popup where you must click 'standup' and not misclick 'blitz' which will lose you time as you try to deactivate your piece by fiddling with the mouse so you can click again meanhwile 0:20 left flashes on the screen...   A simple 'how to' tutorial with basic concepts for this game such as * how to make piece active and how to deactivate it and activate another piece -what exactly do you need to click * how to move * what are tackle zones and what can happen * how to play the odds - make the enemy roll more dice (crucial concept this, game is basically risk management) * pass the ball - how to pass, what are the odds and what are the ranges that you can pass to  2) The matchmaker is the worst I have seen in any other game. Bar none.  Starting up, you make your team (by recruiting players) and your team value (TV) is howevering around 1000. Teams gain value (again, TV, team value) by skilling up their players/pieces. You skill your piece by getting points for either passing the ball or hurting or killing (yes, it's a thing) an enemy piece.  Teams are balanced to play at their starting TV, but in an open league in the game with hundreds of players, you will meet teams which are much higher TV than yours. Who will kill off your team. And skill up more. While your team will get nothing, because they CANNOT accomplish anything due to the mismatch. And they are player by someone vastly more experienced than you, with many more BB2 games (matchmaker doesn't take player experience into account, neither.  You get incentives which 'balance' the game: get extra rerolls (which still fail ALL the time) or a doctor (which may heal your hurt player... or kill him, it is RNG hell).  So basically the vastly superior enemy team skills up by killing off your starter team.  3) No online pause. Game takes, say 40 minutes no breaks... you want to pee? Too bad.  4) Display of crucial information on pieces is horrendous. BB:CE has actual words on player cards which showed up when you moused over a piece. Words like 'Block' or 'Loner', which you could then mouse over and get a text description pop up.  While I could read with no problem the actual words on player cards in BB:CE, the PIXEL SIZED icons on player cards are very hard to read. I have never seen a smaller icon with crucial information for a player in any game.  5) There is a two minute time limit for your turn. Which I guess works well for people who have played BB as a boardgame and have logged many more games than me but for me, the 2 minute turn is NOT ENOUGH.  I feel rushed, I misclick, if you have animations turned on the camera changes to a player running and/or player attacking an enemy piece, which zooms into the action and gets rid of the overhead view which allows you to see what happened where and pre-plan your moves (which you must do - remember, tik tok 2 minute limit, think fast newbie).  Most people turn off the cool animations - so why have them? Why 'upgrade' from BB1 to BB2?  6) The interface is the WORST I HAVE SEEN IN ANY GAME. Let me give you an example - I moved a player with a ball, my thrower, and then wanted to check to which piece I wanted to pass the ball. I moved the mouse over to another of my pieces, and clicked it... Now, by doing so:  I have ended the action for my passer/thrower and activated the other piece... and I am pretty sure I still had moves left on my thrower.  Example 2: To stand up a player in BB:CE, I left double clicked on a piece to do so. In BB2, sometimes left double clicking works for it to stand up but sometimes it does not - and a tiny pop up with 'stand up' and 'blitz' shows up and you must then click 'stand up'. Same player action, different results in game.
4434	0	a	No graphics options present No Fullscreen mode No options for setting up campaigns or leagues Next to no teams with expensive future DLC No names/numbers on players, makes it hard to see which is which Lots of unnecessary time-consuming cut-scenes Multiplayer matcher apparently broken  Doesn't adhere to Blood Bowl rules and no option to make it so.  Get BB:CE instead.
4435	0	a	♥♥♥♥♥♥ MP, bad gameplay, stick to the first game.
4436	0	a	Just terrible... You win if you are the least unlucky player..No good tactics works. All based on dicese. You get points when you're oponent is unlucky and you rage alot...  About as entertainig as flipping a coin for hours on...   Don't buy this game. I wish the money I paid for this would fly out the window instead... It would be more fun.....
4437	0	a	The game is upsetting and bad. There is no info to be found. Beginner unfriendly. Dice decide everything. Dont try to play smart you will get punished. The dice and events that occur make it impossible to plan anything. The referee say the same things all over and arent funny. My first steam review. Tought this piece deserve the first attention out of my 100 games.
4438	0	a	Worst purchase in a while ... Better graphics ? ... I'll give'em that ... but that's mostly it ... Remember how in the first installment, the computer almost never failed any dice roll ? ... guess what, same **** going down again ... Not worth 50$ ... 10 $ at christmas sale. 
4439	0	a	So, I have not played this game in a year and I have next to no information about it and yet I am writing a review because im bored and I felt as though this would be a productive use of time. This game has orcs and ♥♥♥♥, if you like orcs and ♥♥♥♥ buy the game. The humans have wings on their helmets, I dont know if thats badass or gay but either way, im into them. If fantasy football is the kind of thing you're into, go play fantasy football. If you like orcs and different types of races, go read a J.R.R Tolkien bolk. If you like playing videogames, go outside and get a life.  -Sincelery, your mother.
4440	0	a	Nearly no Single player. So its a big no no for me.  Will buy it back when Single Player is back.  The rest = Thumb up !
4441	0	a	♥♥♥♥♥♥ customization options, clunky menus, stupid XP system. They learned nothing from the first game.
4442	0	a	Blood Bowl is originally a board game, and Cyanide once again fails to come up with a 99% correct simulation of said board game. They mess the rules up and toy around with changes and new features in some arbitrary attempt to spice the game up in its digital version. That would be interesting if they had ever managed to get the starting point right, which is the latest release of the board game rules. But they didn't. So those changes are not based on any analysis of actual game results but on personal taste of the guys in charge of this project. That makes Blood Bowl II a house rules game.  The game plain sucks as a video game, its way behind its release date regarding technical aspects like graphics, and as a Blood Bowl game its just sad. Buy it if you want to give them some cash for a third try, but don't waste your time playing Blood Bowl II competitively.  If you are new to Blood Bowl, this is sadly the prettiest video game version as of yet, and Blood Bowl still is a fantastic game concept. So give it a try to get a feel for the game. As soon as you are really into it, you will find this version to fall very short in many ways and you will probably google for other places to play the game. So you might as well do that now...
4443	0	a	Woodelves have male Wardancers now, Its a dream come true!
4444	0	a	currently waiting on my refund , was a terrible experiance
4445	0	a	console port  barebones not many teams  overpriced day 1 dlc
4446	0	a	The game is good. But multiplayer sucks. I dont know what wrong with developers maybe they are braindamaged, but matchmaiking is stupid. Why as a noobie Im playing against pro team I dont understand.
4447	0	a	Worst realisation of Blood Bowl.
4448	0	a	To expensive for what you get and it the games are too long so they get boring ;$
4449	0	a	SO BIASED. I have played the real version of this game for years and have many friends that do ive only know 2 people to get 3 attackers down dies in a roll but apparantly trhis game thinks getting 3 attackers down 4 turns in a rown with re rolls is completeley possibal. this game is so biased it makes it impossibale toplay properly feel gutted ive waisted my money and time on this willo not reccomend and will be veering clear of any game that produces of this style u8ntill theyu sort the ♥♥♥♥ out
4450	0	a	5/10  Would not play again until 10 more races
4451	0	a	you would think they would have learned from their mistakes but they didnt. the game is still so unfair its broken, it isnt fun when the game purposefully makes you lose unless you like losing. dont buy this.
4452	0	a	not the game the add said it was
4453	0	a	 Failed to pick up the ball 7 turns in a row then the half ended with nothing happening
4454	0	a	I went into this game coming from BB:TM (a boardgame) and hoped I could get some interesting games going with heavy team building, but this seems like a game where most of the time is in the matches and the rng there just isn't for me. I dislike wasting an entire turn because my player failed to pick up a ball.   I'm sure if you're down to playing long matches, limited team building and like punishing rng rolls, then this game could be really fun. Just isn't for me.  I tried the campaign but got bored of playing the match before it finished, then I tried making my own team and got bored playing that. The failing of rng is too severe - and I know you can get stuff to reroll failed attempts, but... the matches are still too long and that's not what I was looking for.
4455	0	a	Why did they cut out women? I had lots of fun playing blood bowl 1, even though there were very few female characters. But now the wardancers are suddenly male in blood bowl 2?? And I can't even make an Amazon team.
4456	0	a	Terrible port to PC: I'll stick with C64 Graveyardage (which was what this was stolen from anyway) circa 1989 - Will not use system mouse settings - Not optomized for PC at all - Slow, repetitive, boring, cannot skip useless animations and slow AI - Terrible AI will often not even try to get the ball carrier - Animations are repetive - for example cheerleaders all have one animation and they are played at the same time. - A truly terrible game
4457	0	a	A game based on luck, sometimes is just to pathetic the way the team fails play after play. Also, it takes too long between moves, so it gets very boring, the amount of races is very low, poor customization.. don't recommend , waste of money if it stands as it is... if I could, I would ask for a refund.
4458	0	a	This is my biggest rage game in my library. The dice will hate you. Players take way too long to level up. MAJOR balancing issue between teams. I know the game kinda addresses this by providing a 'skill' gauge with a 1-5 star system, but it's a major let down for players like me wanting to enjoy playing certain teams. I wanted to like the High Elves. The player models are boring. I don't know why anyone would want to play as the humans. The only interesting thing about them is their ogre player. And leveling up your stadium takes even longer! Features that could make the game more interesting via stadium upgrades require a lot of time and effort. And there are less than a dozen different staduims!!! Why the F@#$ is there not a stadium for each team??? There is so much LESS content in this game than in the last game.  Honestly though, I'm not suprised in the least. I HAD high hopes for this game. But this has been the GW bull@#$% practice for the last couple of decades. Save yourself the money. Especially now. If you had gotten this game a while ago, at least you saved yourself some heartbreak by getting the 6 last dlc teams for free. But if you were thiking about it, each additional team is a bout 7 bucks.
4459	0	a	2 boring and weird moments of all game: you rising your characters, pays attention to their skills and stats, put tons of time into the game, but as result after 8-10 games all your team will left you, so if you palyed over 1 week to create 'dream team', just forget about it and start once again! This is so stupid to permament lose you team characters because of 'years' that they spent in game and than start again with noob no skilled players at your league. Second stupid thing is rent for star players, that cannot be lvl'ed but can be hired only for 1 game...  If you like to create every day NEW team, just because stupid developers wants it - this game is for you.   По руки - в игре еть огромный мину, то 'возрат' перонажей. По факту, чаще вего, поле 8 игр вы терете почти вю команду, так как игроки уходт на 'пению'. Это неверотно раздражает, когда ты только прокачал игрока и взл ему нужное умение, перонаж покидает команду навегда (а получить умени поле долгих чаов пота над игрой прото так не дадут - ввиду рандома идиоткого на кубики). Мало того, что перонад может анвегда рандомно быть травмирован и потерть чать татов переход в разрд изгоев, или умереть прмо на поле, то ещё и та идотка итема 'езонноти' 8-10 игр против ботов или реальных игроков и вё, начинай игру заново. Ели вам по вкуу такой 'портивный реализм', то игра дл ва.
4460	0	a	I'm not a football fan, but the game looked like fun so i gave it a try. I should have listened to the reviews, it sucks....  Edit 9-25-16 Apparently people think i'm being too vague, so im here to clear up the confusion. This game has major flaws that ruins the gameplay. These include the turn based system and 'combat' between the players. Winning a game is almost impossible unless you devote hours into the game which I don't intend to do.
4461	0	a	This has got to be the most frustrating and stupid game I've downloaded in a LOOONG time! The players constantly fumble the ball (one match the ball was on the ground for 6 turns in a row with around 5 players fumbling every attempt to pick it up), the game has players simply fall on the ground for no reason at all (which forfeits your turn instantly), the game allows the other team to kick off and then have an AI fan cheer that allows them to catch thier own kick off while your player stand and can't move (oh, then they run for a touchdown).  I could go on and on and on with the stupidity that happens in this game. It has potential but with the stupidity that happens (which I think the Devs were thinking it would be funny) it simply ruins any aspect of tactics involved and turns the game into some wierd form of constant dice roll chance and unforseen mishaps that ruin the play.
4462	0	a	Good game untill you rerol into skulls 50% of the time.
4463	0	a	Game breaking bugs that they have apparently fixed for the multiplayer game but still haven't fixed for the campaign. Avoid.
4464	0	a	No level Customization! What!! This is so bad! Pure lazyness from the devs and very disappointing! I had much bigger hope for this game, but sadly.. Every model looks the same, dispite starplayer lvl, this should be changed.  The looks should change as the player climbs in lvl.  And the stadiums and cheerleaders should be race specific! Hope the devs realize their mistake and do some thing about this!
4465	0	a	I literally yelled in rage at this game
4466	0	a	Yawn.  Incredibly slow moving game, even for a turb-based stratgy game. Seems like it was made as an excuse for the cut scenes, and that's NEVER going to be a good idea.   I picked this up on sale for $6 and I still feel like I got ripped off.  
4467	0	a	Do not buy this game on steam, or at all really. The gameplay i guess is okay, but the rng is horrible. Plus this game is way overpriced on steam and they will not refund you. i played 2 matches in this game about 30 minutes each, but when opening the game it had to configure for a hour so i accidently went over the allowed time to play for a refund by 30 mins and they denied by refund 4 times. Do not buy trust me, just buy a console version for 20 bucks
4468	0	a	This game is not about the skills but about luck in dice and procentage. Its actually almost full random. Which means quite frustrating.
4469	0	a	I bought this game on release (or before? I remember I had Lizardmen back then which I don't have now). After playing just an hour, I got a refund because the dice-rolls were so off it's just not funny. Recently I got this game in a bundle at ~75% OFF and that's the only pricetag I would start to recommend it to casual players.  I'm not a big review-writer, so only one example which frustrates me the most: - Picking up the ball Like seriously, it shouldn't be that hard to pick up a ball as the thrower which is right besides you (after kick-off). I only logged the last 8 trys and (including re-rolls) I managed to pick up the ball 1 single time while the chance was always at 67%. Like a lot of others have written already, the odds/dice are way off because the AI lacks the I(ntelligence).  It's fun to watch the short scenes which are pretty brutal to me since I'm more the strategy type of gamer (Paradox titles mostly) but that's it already. I might play it every now and then when I need a rest from real strategy games because it doesn't involve much brain to play since strategy isn't helping you much anyway when the next roll is off again.
4470	0	a	Disappointingly straight clone of the boardgame with little to no single-player options other than a stupidly simple tutorial.
4471	0	a	Having looked at this game on the market for over 6 months and seeing it was reduced for Halloween I thought I thought hey why not.  Well that was a mistake, RNG is massively sided when playing against the AI, I think I'm missing the numbers 4-6 on my dice, yet the AI doesn't appear to have any number less than 4.   Having spent an entire 2nd match on the campaign retrying after 4th dodgy roll, I think I'm now on my 6th restart, does the game nto want the human player to win any rolls?
4472	0	a	I have 88% chance to doge. I fail, oh well i will just do it again. Does it again, 88% chance, i cant fail this again i have to get it this time but NOPE i fail again. This goes on with me giving up and startign a new game to have around the same percent (always a high percent) and failing over and over again untill i wonder what the ♥♥♥♥ it thinks a chance is. This game takes no skill, you just have to be lucky and if you are not lucky adn your game ♥♥♥♥s you over every single time it is impossible to win this stupid ♥♥♥♥ing game.
4473	0	a	tot it was a football game, dang
4474	0	a	This game makes you hate your friends. All MP is competitive. Strategy is worthless when the dice are constantly bad, you get to wait over an hour while the sands of time fall away. I don't generally want to play games to have a bad time, but it seem the more I play this game and encounter this situation of bad dice it just makes for a horse-♥♥♥♥ experience. Ohh, and when you're through suffering watching your buddy kick your ♥♥♥ into next week the ♥♥♥♥ing announcers make fun of you. So you can take flak from your buddy and the AI. My recommendation is don't play it, don't buy it.
4475	0	a	not really fun im not a fan of turn based games, though i do like football, so i thought id give it ago and it turned out to be something that d&amp;d would have done to football. something im not really happy with getting
4476	0	a	Game is absolute garbage. Poor graphics and the teams are nowhere close to balanced. The RNG is terrible. Constantly role improbable odds that result in losing a game. Had one player role 9 1's in a row, which is roughly a one in a million chance. Also, game is completely based on luck. If a player gets lucky early in the game the other team gets crushed. Not worth the money. Complete waste of time.
4477	0	a	this game is boring as ♥♥♥♥. dont recommend.
4478	0	a	Game's ♥♥♥♥. They forgot blitz mode.
4479	0	a	this is the ♥♥♥♥iest game ever created
4480	0	a	Alright..uhhh...where do I even start? Oh, wait...I know. Where's Thrall?!  Draenei, Blood Elves, Gnomes, Goblins, Pandarians?!?! Where are they?!  Not a single mention of The Emerald Dream.  Honestly, what the ♥♥♥♥?
4481	0	a	you really gota like chess to play this game
4482	0	a	This gave me herpes in a soccer field
4483	0	a	game sucked. 
4484	0	a	Do not turn your nose up on this game because the reviews say mixed. This game looks extremely better than all the previous titles, it plays smoother, its way more user friendly than any other Blood Bowl title. All its missing is the teams from all the others which Surprise, they didnt have at launch either. The Devs are responding to us for the first time ever and have promised the first 4 teams (Which launch in Febuary) for free if you own the game before they launch. Buy this game, and Praise Nuffle  I'm leaving the above review for reference and scope on what I have to say now. It has been 5 months since the release of the game and we got our first new team today. 3 monthes after what was promised, even if it was still free. Most of the fans have died off and wait times for a random matchmade game is ludicrous. Unless you have enough friends to make your own closed league I wouldn't bother anymore. The only option to play anymore really is to join one of the communites that has set up leagues and get into them. The Devs have killed their own game by taking 5 monthes to make one race that should have been started the moment the game went live. GG Cyanide. GG
4485	0	a	New Races WE DONT NEED THAT TOTALLY RIP
4486	0	a	This is a great game killed by bad pricing.  The graphics upgrade is nice, but not worth the cost or bother of climbing paywalls and buying overpriced DLC portioned out in meager servings.  I want to buy Blood Bowl....not stock in Cyanide.
4487	0	a	*Disclaimer* I have no interest in multiplayer-leagues, so this review is about the singleplayer-mode only.  Blood Bowl 2 has the potential to be a great game, but its major fault is that the RNG heavily favors the AI. Which was also the problem of Blood Bowl 1. As long as this isn't fixed, I cannot recommend this game, especially if you own any edition Blood Bowl 1.  *Edit* Incredible, almost one year after release, and the AI still has 'the lucky dice'.
4488	0	a	This was my old review: Less content than bb1 but better quality overall, I'm sure they will implement everything is missed, bb1 was incomplete too at launch.  NOW: what I said at launch was totally wrong, I'm sad to say Blood Bowl 2 it's a fail, specially for people like me who bought it mainly for the single player portion. Not even close to the depth offedred by BB1, the only better thing it's the graphics but I honestly don't care, not if I have to say bye to the features that made me love this game.  Maybe my expectations are just too high, but what I really expected was a BB1 IMPROVED, means same content, better graphics, better netcode, better RNG and so on; nothing revolutionary, nothing really 'new', still, I was disappointed.  This review goes from positive to negative, at this point I'm sure that this game won't go even close to blood bowl 1.
4489	0	a	Gets on to try new race:  -Ball gets 'high kicked' so i can move a player under it to catch it.  -Fails, falls 3 squares away  -Moves another player to the ball to pick it up off the ground  -Fails, Ball falls 3 squares away... Turnover  -An enemy player runs through my team dodging between 2 players, does 2 going for it roles (extra movement with a chance of falling), and then picks up the ball next to my player.  -I run 2 players around him to surround him and get 3 roles, tackle him with the player that fumbled.  -The 3 rolls are all skulls, he knocks down that player ...Turnover  -The enemy runs through the other 2 players dodging both of them and gets a touchdown.  TL;DR: The games RNG is extremely frustrating. The entire game really comes down to a few roles. Other than that it has a very light, simple strategy for running the ball. Simple things in any football game like passing the ball, handing the ball off, or even picking up the ball off the ground, are nearly impossible with a new team. This makes setting up plays impossible and not worth it. (Which is really all the fun of strategy games.)
4490	0	a	It is a fun concept and I enjoy the basic idea behind the game, but it needs a lot of help before I would recommend it. The game play is very clunky; moving the players us a total pain as is trying to play any 'specials' of the players. The interface really needs work. The dice engine is ridiculous. Playing against an online player the dice rolls are not too bad because both sides get equally messed over. If you play against the AI it seems to very rarely miss a die roll no matter how ridiculous, and you will seemingly miss the majority of your dice rolls no matter how good the odds are for you. The player development is also very clunky.

This review goes from positive to negative, at this point I'm sure that this game won't go even close to blood bowl 1.
4500	0	a	So, I like to play this game, but I've been waiting to play a game in match making for hours. And yes, I picked the largest one displayed. Other than that, the campaign mode has some obvious tendancies to favoring the AI rolls. Seeing them get a skull happens less than 1% of the time.
4501	0	a	Really enjoy this game, mainly because it is identical to the table top in every way....except one, and it ruins this game. It claims to use RNG and dice rolls to determine outcomes, which it does, but it is not random. 50+ hours playing this game and I can say the dice rolls favor the AI 100% of the time. Just played a full game where my team was rolling successfully on blocks maybe 1 per turn, which is garbage. The AI on the other hand went an entire match without rolling a single fail on blocks, im talking defender down results on every, single, roll. I do believe in probability, but with the kind of results of seen I would have better luck winning the powerball than seeing this again, and I have, multiple times. When im playing against a human opponent, the game is much more enjoyable since the dice seem to roll like they realistically would, with all results being hit. I know some people are gonna say 'thats just the dice', which normally I would agree, but the non-stop crap results for me/great results for the AI just kills the experience. For the time being I cannot recommend this game with the current state of its 'random' number generation.
4502	0	a	I would really like to recommend Frozen Cortex (FC) to everyone, but sadly I cannot. The game still feels as if it's still in Early Access, or at the very least missing some main features. People who enjoy strategy games, don't really care about graphics. Frozen Synapse (FS) would be a prime example of that; the graphics are very simple, so Mode7 spent most of their resource on the gameplay and mechanics; which turned out great. However, for this one they spent more time on graphics, effect, and cinematic camera. The 3D view at the end of a turn is terrible; half the time it's facing some weird direction, and you'll end up watching the results again almost always, there is also no way to turn it off.   The gameplay is pretty decent, there aren't as many options as FS, so it's more newbie friendly; rules are few and straightforward, within few games you'll get them all. Although, it's missing basic options like, ability to wait a few secs and then throw, or ignore the ball so some other unit could pick it up. Which can be so annoying, because it can be so useful deriving a better strategy and it would also deepen the complexity. Also if you are familiar with the FS's clocks feature, then you'll dislike FC's, it's very inaccurate, and basic. There are also some odd incidents where game doesn't play as expected. I’ve also had times where units would just let an other team’s player pass right through, or not do what I tell them to. Sometimes the turn wouldn’t end even if the ball carrier’s plan is finished, then he would just go straight to score, and get tackled. The procedurally generated maps can be faulty at times. I've had few times, where the offence would be closer to the ball, but they would have to go around some block as their path is blocked, so defence can easily get to the ball earlier and score.  Single player campaign is well done, and different AI do play differently, hence it's not repetitive. The good thing about the multiplayer system is that it's the same as in FS, but that's the bad thing too because it's lacking features it was in FS. Even though they may not be that important, but you would think that Mode7 would learn something from their previous games. Mode7 is quite famous for their terrible community involvement, so that was kinda expected and I won't hold that against them. I have never seen them actively respond on the forums.  Sound wise, nervous_testpilot did it again, it's fantastic. I'm sure you've heard in the trailer, and don't need any convincing. I do notice it breaking when I try out my turns, but that’s probably a bug and might not be the case for everyone.  To wrap it up in a pretty bow or whatever, it is a good game but it's not a complete game. You'll probably enjoy it, if you like the idea, or this genre. If you enjoyed Frozen Synapse, and can live with the bugs, then it’s your game. But if you cannot decide just yet, I'd wait it out and see how Mode7 responds. Hopefully, these issues are solved in the future, I wouldn't hold my breath though seeing Mode7's track record.
4503	0	a	Before you read this review, let me tell you that at one point I was number 4 in the world rankings.   It's an awesome concept, but never lived up to it's potential because the devs abandoned it waaaay too quickly and relased an unfinished product. (in terms of what was promised in the kickstarter) They haven't even updated in over a year. Maybe if they didn't change the name and aesthetics in the middle of development, things would have gone differently. MAYBE.  They then have the BALLS to advertise their another game in the news section. (smdh) I don't think I'll be supporting Mode 7 anytime soon, what if they just abandon it too? (which I doubt because it has a bigger fanbase, but STILL what IF? do you want to support what ifs?)  I want to recommend this game so badly because it's actually really good.  The gameplay, graphics, and music are wonderful. Single player is alright. Muitiplayer works fun but it hardly have people online  (http://steamcharts.com/app/237350#7d)  they should've already done a price drop on this game, but I really think they don't want it to strive.   And before you say oh well maybe its the community. No we all really wanted this game to do well. here's the proof  http://forums.mode7games.com/viewforum.php?f=35&amp;sid=55072932fb8abf1c7197722346601e2e  they haven't even post on their own forums in over a year.  So at the end I leave you with this  Good game, terrible execution.  edit - 6/23/16 at $3.74 wouldn't hurt to try it, maybe it'll finally have people playing.
4504	0	a	Multiplayer is dead.  Has a decent single-player if you dont mind some bugs, which really should have been fixed on release and it doesn't help that the devs have abandoned this game. 
4505	0	a	This is a decent idea that could have been so much more. If it only had some small details like the ability to train your players in certain attribuites and/or level up your players. The basic gist is that this games lacks customization and control over your team and players. There is also next to nothing in terms of help. There is nothing at all that tells you what the equipment you can buy even does, if anything.
4506	0	a	Game has great potential but too many serious breaking bugs and missing features. During the 5 hours i played i encountered 2 game breaking bugs (AI players running through walls and players stuck in impossible situations where no move is legal). The team editor is broken so you cant change the nema or stats of your players. Some times the game fails to render icons during the matches. There is also no way to affect the starting positions of your players. That means that custum players are meaningless because you migh end up with your blockers on the end sides and runners on the scrimmage line. This game is not finished and should not have left alpha stage.
4507	0	a	I have been looking forward to this game for a very long time and it finally went on sale and I grabbed it. However, I'm so late to the party that this game is pretty much dead. The single player campaign has potential as a team manager-style game but if you want to actually direct your players you'll be in for a long wait because the AI takes forever to make a decision. This is especially frustrating when the only move is to pick up the ball that's two steps away, but it takes three minutes to come to that conclusion. The online multiplayer seems to be this games primary way to play, but at this tail end of it's life, there's noone left to play against. The match finding system tells me that I should be playing a multiplayer game in the next 60 seconds, but has so far failed to find me a match EVERY TIME.  Would have been a great multiplayer game in it's day, now there just aren't enough people wanting to play and it's just too darn slow to play single-player.
4508	0	a	I want to recommend this game, but I can't. I want to LIKE this game, but I can't.  A deep, rich strategic experience in a novel format (i.e. future sportsball)? Practically auto-sold on this game. After playing through the tutorial, I get the basics of how to plan turns and such, so I move on to the Basic League.  Here's the thing, though: this game does a terrible job of explaining itself. I know how to move my bots, but not why I should. It takes me a couple games before I realize that the goal of the game is less 'get the ball in the end zone,' and more 'figure out what your opponent isn't going to expect or counter, and do that,' but I STILL don't know how to reliably gauge what are good options or plays. Half the time it feels like whatever I simulated during the Planning Phase doesn't work out -- bots don't block like I expect them to, or (more importantly) chase the ball carrier like I expect them to. The bots have half a dozen stats that aren't even mentioned in the game tutorial/help (nor shown in the tabular Free Agent view). I still don't know what the hell 'Halt' does.  Undeterred, I move on to the regular League, hoping that will give me more options for managing my team between games. But then I discover that I have the worst bots in the GCL, and my salary cap goes up by a paltry few hundred dollars per win while the free agents' 'expected' salary shoots up by over a thousand dollars per game week. So, I'm basically stuck with my starting lineup of losers and mostly-losers, facing off against teams with all green (positive) stats -- my bot tackled an enemy bot who literally shrugged it off and walked past because his RESIL was maxed. I'm playing a game that appears to be about outmaneuvering/out-thinking an enemy when I am unable to estimate the outcome of a play and don't even really know which plays are good ones, AND my guys are the worst bots in the League? The only way out appears to be to grind losses until I get better at understanding how to make the best plays possible with my awful lineup, and after 15 losses I don't think I want to play anymore.  I think part of this could be made better if there was a better strategy guide to the game, but I didn't see anything like it online. There was a section of Mode7's forums devoted to Frozen Cortex, but there was nothing useful there. It's a shame, the game seems like it has a great depth of strategy to it, but it's too obfuscated and inaccessible to new players.
4509	0	a	Strategy was actually rather lacking. Most of the novel features don't seem that novel or important to the core gameplay. The core gameplay itself is rather boring or poorly executed and confusing. The window dressing of managing your team and its repair could be a saving grace, but is not in this case. Game does not succeed at being a strategic game, nor as a management sim type game.
4510	0	a	Well thought out. Simple. Easy to understand, decently complex. Matches are short, but the planning is long. For the first few hours, then Frozen Cortex becomes obvious, easy, and dull. No personal investment in your team because you just buy better robots instead of developing ones you have. Once you've basically figured out what to do the AI is too easy. Playing human players really doesn't change the level of engagement, at least for me. It did not feel satisfying to win or frustrating to lose to another human being.
4511	0	a	The single player game is just punishingly difficult to start with, by design as it sticks you with trash bots against much, much better teams. It's depressingly un-fun. You can grind for a long time and finally upgrade, but again, not fun.  The story seems irrelevant. There are no story choices.  The core gameplay is good, but there's a lot of 'he knows that I know that he knows that I know I can't run here or...' You cover the most options you can, but outguessing seems to rule the day.
4512	0	a	I actually bought Frozen Cortex on accident prior to Steam's newer return policies, and was stuck with it. I put off trying it for months (definitely DON'T consider me part of this game's target audience.)  I finally booted it up today, and enjoyed learning how to play the game. I actually was a fan of Frozen Synapse (despite not being particularly interested in a sports translation of that game) so the mechanics were a bit familiar.  I'm trying to stick with it despite throwing my hands up repeatedly. AI seems frequently to (A) run straight in to your guys, thus giving up the ball or (B) hurling the ball in to some far distance of the arena (even straight in to the end zone quite frequently). This kind of nonsensical lack of actual strategy heavily impacts the game as you really have to constantly think about what bizarre things the AI will do to try and take advantage of the sport's lax rules. It's not even really the AI's fault; this is simply what the rules of the game lead to as it's better to take a chance flinging the ball towards your goal line when things get tough.  In short, the sport they've invented here is missing some rules. Watching it isn't exciting, and playing it feels more like a test than a game as you're fighting to keep it from degrading in to just throwing the ball huge distances and seeing who picks it up first.  You could do worse it seems - I think the team behind it probably worked very hard - but an element of fun seems to be mostly missing. Just seems like the title they used to kill time until Frozen Synapse 2 is in full swing.
4513	0	a	It's a good game, but there are too few players.
4514	0	a	Feels like an incomplete mini game. Not worth even half the money. Going back to a real game; Blood Bowl.
4515	0	a	FAO: Mac users.  THIS game is deeply broken in OS X.  I've tried it on both my macbook (i7, SSD, 8gb RAM, just pre-retina) and my iMac (2013, i7, SSD, 1gb GFX, blah) and both have encountered the same problems.  The game crashes so frequently that it's utterly unplayable.   Moreover, team rosters cannot be edited - mousing over any players who might be 'replaced' wipes them blank, and wipes any potential placements blank, too. Meaning that you end up with a team of blanks every time you try to edit.  I've tried blitzing gfx down to minimal, running it in a window, rebooting, having nowt else going in the background, turning wifi off, turning wifi on, ermmmm... verifying game cache... But, basically, it's knackered. WILL NOT RUN on OS X.   Big disappointment, particularly (duh) as I spent my food money on this! OOps. Bananas for lunch tomorrow, then.  Both my machines are running Yoesemite, fwiw.
4516	0	a	There's so much wrong with this game I don't know where to start. -Blocks only work if you're standing still, so you can't 'tackle' other bots. -AI will always move to counter to your plan, no matter what you do they will predict it. -Interceptions are the only way to stop a catcher standing still. If your bot moves in to stop him, he'll be kicked away. -Interceptions only work when they want to. Sometimes you're not in the path of the ball and you intercept, sometimes you have 3 guys infront of the catcher and they let it past. -The AI will hail-mary as soon as they pick up the ball and because their bots are so much faster than yours, you will never be able to stop it. -No team development, just replace old bots with better ones. -You can't afford better bots even if you win every game. Which you won't. -Can't pass after making a run. -The only way to win singleplayer league is through passing onto point zones. Any run you make will be blocked. -You won't win singleplayer league anyway.  +Playing against a human might be fun, at least their bots will be as dumb as yours.  Seriously, buy Blood Bowl instead. It's got more depth, actions work how they're supposed to, you develop your team instead of just replacing them, RNG may be a factor but at least you know why something didn't work.
4517	0	a	I've got to be honest, I love turn-based strategy games, but I don't like this. I simply don't have the patience for it. It's Words With Friends meets American Football.  The client user interface is clunky. There's an IRC chat room frame. You can't quit games. Only the pre-rendered cutscenes are fluid. Everything else is actually quite clunky. There's also no time limit on turns, so you're waiting around a lot. It can also take a while to find a multiplayer game. In single player, the AI takes a good while to make up its mind about what to do.  There's a reason the basic tier included a copy for a friend.
4518	0	a	Conceptually, the game is very cool and innovative. It's interesting enough to have a decent single player experience. However, because multiplayer is simply a dead/dieing community (most people I have seen online at one time is 6-7 people), I cannot reccomend this game, as the replay value is very limited. If you think you might enjoy it, pick it up on sale (50% discount or higher).
4519	0	a	I'm a big fan of Frozen Synapse and FS Prime so I thought I'd give this a go. It's the same kind of gameplay but my immediate reaction was that it looks like american football which instantly leaves me cold. This may seem like an unfair reason to give a thumbs-down but that's my personal opinion. It's like Mode 7's ginger stepchild, I see no reason to choose it over FS, FS Prime or the upcoming FS2 (which I'm very excited about).  And no trading cards?
4520	0	a	 A Rather Frustrating PVP Experience
4521	0	a	This game is not worth the money. On the Pro side it is a cool idea with a sleek polish that makes you think a cross between football and robot wars. What you get is actually an AI who will always guess your moves, ALWAYS. Even if you wait for it to finish it thinking and change all of your players to different patterns and plays the AI somehow is never left at a disadvantage and more likely than not will come out on top thanks to its superior omnipotent guessing skills. Also starting off you are given bots(players) who are 4/5 all negative in skills....negative. So prepare to play season after season of losses or barely scrapping wins until you get enough to buy decent players and actually enjoy any sort of gameplay.  I thought hey maybe all this is just because the AI is terribly coded and the online play will make up for it. Well here is to 3 days in a row logging on and searching for a game to be told no one online wants to play. For the price of decent mid range game I expected a lot more. I would not recommend spending money on this game.
4522	0	a	This game was a lot of fun for the first 10 hours, but it did not have the necessary variation to play it any longer. It is a very creative idea for a game, but one simple strategy would win every game against the computer
4523	0	a	Frozen Cortex is an interesting concept game, but it is far from a fully realised management experience. So much is missing from the single player league part - from a proper, nice interface to any kind of sensible development of players.  If you want to try the concept and perhaps have a go at multiplayer, go ahead and buy it. If you want a fully fledged single player experience, don't.
4524	0	a	'Hey guys, what if we took a radical far-future setting and aesthetic which we've already developed extensively through our previous game, the intellectual legwork done to create a convincing yet unique narrative context, aswell as a more refined persistant faction-type upgrades system and oodles of customization options, and made it about    SPORTS   .'  I'm glad to see they'll be returning to Synapse for a sequel, and I think a lot of the things they tried to do here are actually pretty cool if a bit cringey, and hopefully they'll be able to develop them into full-fledged and functional features for the real game. Bought for OST, do not buy without extreme sale unless you like robot stop-motion football, in which case   jump off a bridge   go nuts.
4525	0	a	- No hot seat mode to play with my family on my minix tv box (Windows 10 + mouse).  - The game runs too slow (minimum graphic settings). - Too many options I can understand when I try to start a new custom game. Settings for custom game looks like was made for programmers. - The game crashes when AI player is thinking. I didn't finish any game. And the AI thinks up to 5 minutes. - I don't think turn preview is good idea. I spend too much time to test my turn before prime and that calculation is annoing. - This game was made for Frozen Synapse users whos spend hours for each turn and it's not funny when you have family and just want to relax with beer and to play legue with friends and family. I mean one does turn and the rest of players can't see what he doing. We play Civ and Heroes in the same way.  So this game need to be reviewed and improved if it have to be attractive for most of people.
4526	0	a	When connected to the Server, the games crashes Windows all the time after about 1h of play (under Windows 8 Professional 64 bits), forcing my computer to reboot.  Offline, the game crashes after about the same time. Windows stays up this time.
4527	0	a	I will admit that it is a very unique concept. Simultaneous turn based ... robot football. Which I believe is a great concept that worked well in their other game Frozen Synapse (simultanous turn based strategy game). But I felt it didn't work too well in this format. The animations are nice but everything still felt slow and outdated. Also I felt the camera control and angles are not the best.
4528	0	a	Community is dead, and overall the game is very barebones, although it's a fun take on strategy . blood bowl, the first one, while not the same game (you take turns simultaneously in cortex), is a much more extensive package for less money.
4529	0	a	Good aesthetic, good UI, but there just isnt enough to it to make me play it.  The bots stats seem irrelevant. There arent enough turns in a game or enough options to make real tactics viable. Cant help but feel they should have stuck to updates for frozen synapse, which is a much better game.
4530	0	a	Frozen Cortex is a very pretty game but beyond that there isn't much to like about it. The soundtrack grinds on you, and the in game sounds aren't that great either.  The AI seems to have terrible balancing with it either being ridiculously easy or completely at the other end of the spectrum being impossible to beat.  The level design is a nice feature to keep things fresh.  Pros: Graphics, Level Editor and Multiplayer Feature Cons: AI, Sound  I would have liked to play a demo before buying this game as if I had, I wouldn't have bought it.
4531	0	a	What little I have played of this game is fun, but a warning I wish I had known of before purchasing is that the game has a serious bug preventing me from booting it up again. Other than what I played in my first sitting I cannot get the game to boot up, and unfortunately i'm going to have to give this game a 0/10 until said problem is fixed. Avoid like the plague if you want a functioning game!
4532	0	a	A more buggy crash filled game I haven't purchased in a long while.
4533	0	a	This game is absolutely terrible. The computer takes 2-3 minutes to think every single turn, and the games are short and boring.   Do not buy.
4534	0	a	What a complete waste of time. This game is like football, only one tenth as fast and one tenth as interesting.  ...seriously, what were you guys thinking? Go get some sleep and try again.
4535	0	a	awesome idea but computer counters 90% of what you do also the computer knows how to score on you 100% of the time.
4536	0	a	solid concept but poorly optimized, I got an i7, 12 gigs of ram, gtx 580 and it struggles to load a game that has no complex shapes or high poly count.  few bugs and a clunky interface keeps this game from being the great game it could be.
4537	0	a	I was fooled into buying this game by the publisher, not realizing it was early access at the time I jumped at buying a sequel to Frozen Synapse. This was before steam refunds so I was stuck with a buggy empty 'game'.  Not really saddened to hear that nobody is playing it and that it was a commercial failure despite the fact they're trying to sell it for almost one hundred euro.
4538	0	a	Out of the 3 hrs that it said that I played. I was only able to play for 15 mintues . Multiple crashes to desk top and system reboots I guess that counts for playing time. I hope they fix the problems its seems enjoyable game when I was able to play. Do not recommend.
4539	0	a	Very poor... Don't let the minimum specs fool you. I tried to run this on an i5 3Ghz latop with 8GB RAM and a GeForce 825 - the game is unplayable.  Graphical options are Ultra, High or Low - that's it, nothing else...  
4540	0	a	 Early Access Review
4541	0	a	Only English language is supported. Multiplayer requires you to create an Account and doesn't make use of Steam features avoiding this. You get Emails when others challenge you? No thanks! If I knew this before, I wouldn't have bought it!
4542	0	a	It turns out when take the clunky, annoying simultaneous turns gamplay of Frozen Synapse and make a 5 on 5 footbal game with it, you get a clunky, annoying football game too.
4543	0	a	Various crashes make it unplayable. In its current state, I would recommend to stay away from this game.
4544	0	a	I should love this game and if I gave it more time, maybe I would but the very tedious and long tutorial made me give up beofre I had even begun

4550	0	a	Single player in this game is a lacking. Matches only last a certain number of plays. I would say they last maybe 15 minutes a piece. IDK.   This is a very niche type of game watch youtube videos of it if you are thinking of buying it.   The game is bug free as far as i could tell. I just don't care for the game itself.
4551	0	a	Game play is a great experiance, navigating the menues is not. Never worth £18 Maybe worth £5 in the sales
4552	0	a	The computer cheats. It's ridiculoiusly hard to play. This game has potential but seems like it lacks depth in so many small areas that could really make this game the killer of Blood Bowl.
4553	0	a	Compared to MotoGP 06 on the xbox 360, this game is terrible. Seven years on and the MotoGP licensed games have not seen any improvement.  Poor gameplay, poor graphics, poor sound  Avoid....
4554	0	a	Phenomenally crap 'photo realistic graphics' - videos that show far far far better quality than available in game. I'm running everything on max settings, Game play is clunky, messy and looks awful. Huge waste of £9.
4555	0	a	Online doesn't working any more because of low server storage :))))) funny reason
4556	0	a	After trying many,many different setups the responsiveness in turning still sucks. Its like a two wheeled tractor. Wish I would've saved my money. I give this game the finger!
4557	0	a	Could have been a lot better. Graphics are quite good, but all the riders look the same. Physics are quite good, but again, could be better. The game feels sloppily and quickly made. For example, there is a 'team management' type thing after every race, where you can check emails and social feeds from other riders and team managers, but they all say the same thing every time. Utterly pointless. My other gripe is if you have a crash or slide out, others riders behind you just ride straight through you like you are a ghost, wtf? This is a very rushed game, and corners were cut everywhere. 4/10
4558	0	a	I really can recommend this game only for a big fans of MotoGP and only because there is no other option. For others it's not an option. First of all, it has some critical issues which lasts for months without fixing. You can find occasionally that your career is no longer saving or the game isn't starting. But even without this it's far from perfect. AI is too easy to beat (on some tracks even extremely easy) on the higest difficlty level (with semi-pro physics), graphics was great seven years ago, it's almost always rainig, AI has cheat lap times in qualifying and a boy, who beats everyone in Moto3 and Moto2, winning almost every race, is only welcome in CRT teams (which makes your career looks pretty strange). But if you're ok with that, go and buy it right now! In fact, you don't really have a lot of choice in moto games, do you?
4559	0	a	Do I think this is a good game? In some respects, yes. The bikes are fairly hard to handle as you move up the classes (as it should be) and the tracks are actually kinda fun. However, they need to put the difficultly up to a point where you're doing well to be midfield on a midfeild bike. The AI drops around 1.5-2 seconds in race trim, while yourself can keep the same laptimes. Takes away from a lot of good battles. Frustratingly, in the wet, the game is horrible. No realism, too much grip (even on pro mode) and not enough sliding. Ruins all the positive points.
4560	0	a	Won't load at all; i should have read the forums before buying. WIndows 10 64 bit isn't supported? I can't tell...all forum recommended fixes don't work....reinstalling C++ no good; my version is newer. Copied .dll to game folder and still no change. I'll change this review if I ever get it to work...
4561	0	a	I was a bit dissapointed with this game from a visual level and also from a game play level. Its 2013 and the graphics for this game are just really really basic. Also everytime you lean into a corner it seems like a life time, especially when you go through the twisty parts of tracks. There is no visual damage at all and if you do fall of the motorcycle it dosent even break.
4562	0	a	Sorry, I even refunded this game to Steam after 2hours of gameplay.   The handling felt not real. I couldn't control the bike even I setup the bike exactly the same with the settings in MotoGP 14. I can win the race easily in MotoGP 14, but here I can't even control my bike. I don't know why, but the bike skidding too much.   So despite all the negative comments, bugs, &amp; all the minus of MotoGP 14,  MotoGP 14 is still the best! Much much better than the 13!! It brings out the rider spirit in you!!!  Can't wait for the 15...
4563	0	a	Milestone doesn't care about your feedback !
4564	0	a	This game is really glitchy! it gets really bad an screws you up!!!
4565	0	a	I usually give games at least 3 hours before I write a review about them. I could barely stand this game for 30 minutes. The graphics are out of date even for 2013, the sound of the motorcycles are terrible and the physics are F-ING HORRIBLE. I have driven motorcycles too. This is not even close to a motorcycle Sim. This game isn’t even realistic to how a motorcycle reacts. I got this game for 5 bucks and 5 bucks is nothing. This game isn’t even worth 5 bucks they should pay me to play this game again. Avoid this game. 3/10
4566	0	a	Worst MotoGP game of recent time...  Had that feeling from watching online gameplay vids.. only brought it because of the sale and ended up even worser than i thought.  Any of the last 3 MotoGP games are better in pretty much every aspect including the last one that milestone themself made back in '08... Yes the game made by the same company 5 years ago had better visuals, audio, gameplay, simulation... it even had better controller feedback.  The 1 thing that this game does better then other MotoGP games is the near crash/saves animations but seriously feels like that was all they spent their time on as everything else was comparable to motorbike games of 8 years ago  uhh hope they step it up for 14...
4567	0	a	Having played MXGP by the same developer, I was really REALLY looking forward to this game, must have hell good graphics I thought as I waited for the 5.5Gig install to download..........well what a surprise...with EVERYTHING set to maximum, it looked to be something from the mid-late 90's at best and as for the sound, well...how can I put this....imagine a very VERY p@#ssed off wasp trapped in a megaphone, underwater, inside a submarine, under a rock...that's what the sound is like. In fact what it actually reminded me of was a sound my OLD acorn electron used to make when I was playing Mars Lander (written in BASIC, by hand, one rainy Sunday afternoon) way back in around oh, say 1980! As for the rest, good physics but yeah, presentation killed it for me after only 37 minutes of playing, I just couldn't deal with it...........it looks NOTHING like the screenshots and they aren't that flas for a game that's only 2 years old! OK, so having had another loook, the graphics aren't QUITE as bad as I made out.........
4568	0	a	I used to love this series and assumed that not having played it for some years it would be so much better now and if I got a Motorcycle controller it would be more controllable. I don't usually put much store in reviews as they are always subjective and based upon the individuals experience, likes, dislikes, skill level etc. However, I wish I had taken notice of all the negative reviews on this one. Clearly the console version has been given all the development funding and the PC version left to rot and just there as a token gesture. graphics were better on my Amiga (may be pushing it s bit) but clearly not designed around PC Platform, mouse doesn't work as you would expect on menus etc. it is just horrid. Don't waste your money, I'm going back to my PS3 for this game.
4569	0	a	Good Good graphics.  Bad The game feels cheap(subjective).  Bike control are clumsy.   Verdict I was expecting newer Moto GP 3 URT. But Milestone are not Climax. And great Moto GP games are the ones made by Climax.
4570	0	a	This game is made by milestone, the game have less option for graphic settings and it is also the same for other racing games made by them. This make the game harder to play on moderate PC. The graphics quality are mediocre and it requires better graphics card.
4571	0	a	I auctualy ride, and feel the designers of this game have never even seen a real motorcycle before, otherwise they may have been able to make it auctualy handle like a real one. These bikes have no ability to turn, and you will spend more time on the ground then in the seat. the visuals will feel like your going maybe 10mph at most, and should be able to take a corner fine, but the speedo sais something like 130kph, and you will lay down the bike in almost every corner. WTF?!? I bought this game a few months back when it was on sale for about 3$, I finally was able to take a few minutes to play it. and spent most of the time trying to set up the bike to auctualy be able to take a turn. I regret even spending the 3$ on this pile of garbage. I played this searies Way back when i was a kid, I think their first or second game. And I remember having a blast playing it then, I guess they just lost their touch. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! it is a complete waste of money. I wish Steam had a refund program that went further back then a few weeks.
4572	0	a	Game crashes at track loading screen. researched the problem as much as I could and could not come up with any solution other than disabling audio, which playing a videogame without audio seems totally stupid. I am running Windows 10 with all current drivers and the high-end Nvidia graphics card. All of my specifications exceeded even the recommended level for this game. It simply would not work once you got to the track loading screen. To make matters even worse you cannot control alt delete to get out of this. I had to actually log out or force a hard power restart. With such little information regarding this problem and how to fix it I cannot in good faith recommend this game though it seems like it would be a very good one if I could get past this issue. I will likely be asking for a refund.
4573	0	a	seems i can not change controller deadzone and sensivity.....in a racing game.......oh dear developers. *facepalm*
4574	0	a	Well this hasnt aged well at all... Personally I wouldnt pay any more than a few £ for it and I cant really see myself investing any more time into it.
4575	0	a	Worst game ever... Basically the same as all the other motorcycle games where you can't control you're lean angle. You just CAN'T steer the bike properly due to the way the game is setup (no manual control over this either!) I have tried KB, game pad (Logitech rumblepad II) and a wheel. Nothing can overcome the lack of steering control.   The issue is... When cornering, your either on full lean angle or no lean angle.. Nothing in between is controlable, so holding the racing line or any line for that matter is impossible. Basically it's like driving a car around any angle of corner with either no steering lock OR full steering lock to choose from!  The game is impossible to exit too, you MUST finish your race before being allowed to exit. I needed to restart my computer on each occasion to exit the game fully. My computer is a top end self built machines and has no issues with any other programs including all the others in my 400GB+ Steam folder.  Wish I hadn't wasted the £9 on the special offer now!

4580	0	a	Why are you looking at the bad reviews? This game is awesome!!!
4581	0	a	Ugly graphics (a DX9 engine in 2013!) and jerky controls make this game eyetorturing unplayable, just give this one a pass.  Strangely, I have Superbike 2000 on cdrom from the same devs which looks and plays better considering it's a thirteen years older game.
4582	0	a	Well, if u look at the pictures, the graphics look nice, but they are actually ♥♥♥♥, im not saying the game is bad, but the graphics look 10x better in the trailer. + u cannot use ur mouse, what is anoying af, and the control settings are weird af.  i do not recommend it, its a reason why its 85% off.
4583	0	a	This is by far the worst game I have ever played there is no tutorial, you can only select items with arrow keys and enter. The controls are strewn through the entire key board and I couldn't even get 30 seconds into a race before the game crashed. On start up the controls we're broken and everything went wrong. But by far a complete waste of money and time. You'd be better off playing bear simulator.
4584	0	a	Critic: The game it's a little bit hard to control, I am always falling off the bike. Graphics are not bad for a 2013 game. The tracks are good too.  Rating - 35/100  Conclusion: The rating was bad because the critic doesn't have good things in it, so I'm not recommending this game to you guys.
4585	0	a	Dont buy this game, it is waste of your hard owned money. Using arrow keys as steering makes it impossible to manouvering the bike naturally. Absolutely waste af hard owned money, and you time. Paying 40 Euro for this game is a joke ! 
4586	0	a	bad/10  * Bad controls * Bad Physics * Bad price (even on 90% off sale it is a rip) * Old game with a little paint on it * Not fun * Trainer does not work properly * Controler uses only 1 stick for leaning and steering. This is not a motorcycle simulator. It is not really a n arcade game either. * Sounds suck * Bad PC port   If you like bad games , you will love this one.  If you like motorcycle games I suggest MX VS ATV unleashed. You have one stick controlling the steering, and the other stick is for the riders weight shifting.  If you want streetbike raceing, Grand Theft Auto 5 has much more realisti controls, and physics than this 'game'.
4587	0	a	I'm using a laptop so I can't really play a lot of games. And I didn't know anything about refunding games when I bought this game.  I wanted to play the game even tho it was lagging (and I put my video settings on the lowest but it didn't work). I didn't have a controller so it was hard to control the vehicle.  then the next month my friend told me on how to refund games then I got mat because I can't refund it.
4588	0	a	The game is fun, but the user base is very small. And they keep dividing it even more with Stadium and Canyon. Better have a look at Nations Foreve, a free game. Edit: It freezes a lot too.
4589	0	a	the game is fun but the servers are dead, also its an over priced dlc.

4591	0	a	game is fine .. but not as good as canyon .. car controls is very tight for the game as loosly controled like this one ..  graphics and surrondings are nice .. but some blocks in mud areas seems to be difficult to get that they will hit u or not ..  i will prefer to go with stadium or canyon than this one !!
4592	0	a	When compared to its predecessor 'TrackMania² Canyon' ... this game falls short for me on so many levels. The gameplay and handling are nowhere near as tight. The cars look like they were designed in lego land. The stunts and tracks do not have the same 'awe' factor. Environment visuals are pretty good. But the fun factor just isn't there for me.
4593	0	a	FFS, UBi. Really? So my acceleration bindings have mysteriously disappeared. No problem, right? Just reassign it. Oops. There's bug there. Trying to reassign a key causes the program to crash so hard that only hitting the case power button can get you out (which also obviously causes Windows to shut down).  Head to Steam forums. See a thread where somebody is having issues. Solution is don't rebind keys. There's a bug at the moment. That thread was from February. *Looks at calender* May 31st.  Gee whiz, thanks Ubi. This is why you're so beloved. Thanks for this worthless POS I now own.  Why am I thanking you? You say this wasn't a gift? I paid money for this? Damn, you're right. I guess that makes me an idiot then.
4594	0	a	Maybe my opinion is coloured by nostalgia but didn't the older trackmania games use to be a lot more fun? The key gameplay mechanic on these games is to retry the tracks repeatedly to find the perfect line through the course and beat set times. This is fun when the cars are easy to control but in this game when driving off road the handling is so twitchy you just have to fight to keep the car on the track and you can't think about improving your line. This increased difficulty means there is a significant number of tracks that I will never be able to play. Even despite that this just features race events and none of the other types of event from previous games. With that in mind the price tag is quite hefty for what you get. In my opinion the pinnacle of the series was Trackmania Sunrise eXtreme but good luck finding a copy of that and getting it to work on Windows 7 so my recommendation is to get Trackmania United, it is much better value. The only positive this has over United is that the graphics are better.
4595	0	a	  English:    I would prefer half a thumb up for TrackMania ² Valley, as it is not worth it if you have already played another Trackmania ² (as I Canyon). It differs only in the location (and that is even worse), so I think it's rude of Nadeo that they make it into three gameplay-equal cash investments (I'm obviously an idiot fell for it). However, for those who have still played no part of the series, it is recommended with 5 out of 10. Anyway, I would rather play Canyon: The reason is in the review of that game!     Deutsch:    Ich würde Trackmania² Valley am liebsten einen halben Daumen geben, da es sich nicht lohnt wenn man schon ein anderes Trackmania² (so wie ich Canyon) gespielt hat. Es unterscheidet sich eben nur in der Location (und die ist sogar noch schlechter) und daher finde ich es unverschämt von Nadeo das sie daraus gleich drei vom Spielprinzip genau gleiche Geldanlagen machen (Ich Idiot bin natürlich darauf reingefallen). Für alle die allerdings noch keinen Teil der Reihe gespielt habe ist es mit 5/10 Punkten zu empfehlen. Ich jedoch würde eher Canyon spielen: Der Grund steht in der Review dazu!
4596	0	a	Ubisoft purchased Nadeo on the back of Trackmania’s steady success. And it was never the same since then. They just need to make a new Trackmania United-like game with many different environments (at least 3), ditch Maniaplanet altogether and release the thing as one game, it isn't that difficult ...
4597	0	a	I loved trackmania for many years, but with this new mania planet system they've had for a whie, it just frustrates the hell out of me. The amount of stuffing around just to get something done. I just want to join a quick match... gotta wait for mania planet to load.... wanna change my settings ... gotta pay planets, BUT my account isnt validated yet so I cant spend my planets. HOW THE HELL is it not validated?! I'm on steam, I bought it through steam and signed in with my mania planet login ages ago. How many gates of authentication do you bloody need!!!  Theres no quick easy way to get a validation code either, I gotta go digging through all my old emails to find it, OR gotta get a new one sent.  Stuff it. I should have never bought this game. Nadeo's current mania planet system is just added busy work when I just want to quickly and casually play their game. Won't be playing any more.

4603	0	a	I dont enjoy this game based on my multiplayer experience , 20 second tracks played all the time i really wodu liek to see tracks that are like 3-5 minutes long not something banged up together in 5 minutes and it looks pretty much ♥♥♥♥ 90% of time. I made my own tracks in singleplayer its ok bud meh when you create it , it doesnt feel same.
4604	0	a	This game is terrible. I can't see my friend's times, can't add them on my list, can't play online because of infinite update loop, I can't even get my money back because I bought the key from a different site, I wasted 6 euros for this terrible and broken experience. Everyone, please don't buy this bugged game.
4605	0	a	  Why should you care about my review?    I am a father of two boys, ages 3 and 6 and hold a BA in Game Design (although I work as a database admin - tough to leave a job of 15 years to pursue the 'dream' of game design with a family to support.) That aside, we use a HTPC with Steam in Big picture Mode launched from XBMC. With a wife and two young ones, everything has to be remote and controller friendly. The games also have to be kid-friendly. If you find yourself in a similar situation and trust the opinion of a trained game designer (but not professionally working at it) - then read on.  edit: since I bought the Trackmania three game pack, I am posting the same review in the other two titles as the pros and cons are the same for all (except for Valley, which has a Con unique to itself - see below.)    Pros    -- The game was cheap. $20 for three games (Stadium, Canyon, and Valley) during the Steam winter sale made this something worth trying out.  -- Despite not having an ESRB rating (that I could find anyway), the games are kid friendly. Physics are loose, no bodies are flying out of cars, you can restart at a spawn point on the track, facing the right way (important for the three year old!) at any time you get stuck. I can start a split-screen game and choose a 'playlist' for the kids to race at the same time. They're happy, I'm happy.  -- The game is fun. Stunts, fast cars, loose physics, respawns, tricky tracks, loop tracks, various difficulties, time trials, medals, rankings. And I haven't even tried actual online multi-player yet. I'm not too interested in that part so I won't review that part of the game at this time.  -- Game runs smooth. I've experienced no crashes (the game software, not cars!), no jerkiness, graphics are decent, controls on a 360 controller are easy enough for the three year old to win races against his big brother occasionally.    Cons    -- The interface is severely lacking. Poor design choices abound. To launch the games, Steam launches another launcher (ManiaPlanet). In this new launcher, you see all three games you purchased (after you installed them all). However, if I click on 'Stadium' from Steam, then decide to play 'Canyon' in the ManiaPlanet (MP) launcher, it says I have to restart the game I want from Steam. What's the point of this extra layer of launcher then? Stupid design.  -- The MP launcher is not controller friendly. This means I have to get the keyboard out just to be able to arrow down to the 'Start Game' button. You can't hit it with ANY button on a controller. Once that's done, you can use the controller in game, but not in this MP launcher.  -- Selecting items using the controller is poor design. Blue text turns a bit 'more blue' or slightly brighter. Arrows that are white turn slightly brighter when selected. The wife and kids can't tell what the heck they're navigating. I know about this and I can barely see this on a 42' screen. It's clear the interface is designed only for mouse. The controller does work, but it's not easy to see the navigation. This means I have to setup the game for the kids. I have to get them into the tracks, I have to change playlists (or games if they want to play Stadium for instance.)  -- Kids can't get their own profile. I tried setting the game to use 'multiple profiles' but the feature is nigh-useless. I attempted to create a profile for my eldest so he can have his own rankings or even just his own car model when playing split-screen. I didn't want him to access online so I created a local profile. Now none of the games launch. They say 'You must connect online to launch the game.' I did say LOCAL account didn't I? Again, stupid. So I tried to create a new profile using my already created online account (cause I couldn't get the games to run even by myself before doing this.) The game wouldn't let me do that. Only one key per account it says. I tried creating a new account to the same effect. They want you to buy the game again just so you can use multiple profiles. So to recap, you can't create a local profile without connecting it to an onlne account and you can't create multiple users under one account and you can't create multiple online accounts without buying additional licenses. Stupid.  -- Due to the above, the simple feature in almost any racing game, choosing a car skin, can't be done except by the online profile. So my kids playing in split screen have to settle for the plain gray cars and my eldest can't keep his own records and scores.  -- Car engine sounds disappear when you select High quality Audio (you have to keep it at normal).  -- Some of the tracks are way too difficult for really little ones (not a knock on the game, just something to be aware of.)  -- Controls are not consistent between solo play and multiplayer. For example, the respawn button by default is the yellow Y button in solo play. In split screen, you push down (click the button) on the left analog stick. I'd like to remap it as the respawn button on the steering control leads to accidental respawns However, it doesn't seem to 'take' as it looks like it's tied to profiles, which as mentioned above, I can't create.  -- the in-game HUD is awful. Everything is so small it's pointless on a big screen from across the room. Thankfully the kids don't care about this info, they just want to race. Worth noting.  -- this Con is unique to Valley. In the other two games, we can begin a split screen game by selecting a playlist of tracks and the game starts, We can race each track until a player gets 30 points (3 wins) or whatever we set it to be. In Valley however, the playlists don't work - it dumps you into a script programming screen which is blank. I don't feel I need to spend time figuring how they screwed up programming the install of this game just so we can play multi-player playlists like the other two games. Frustrating.    Conclusion    There is just too much stupidity in design to overcome for me. So if you find yourself with a media center that also serves as a game machine for the kids and are looking for a fun racing game the little ones can enjoy. I'd consider this title at rock-bottom prices otherwise I'm recommending you go elsewhere. You simply can't do simple things other racing games can, nothing is intuitive, the interface is awful (both menu and during racing). Despite that, once you get a race going, it is fun for the kids. So the core gameplay is ok, it's all the design elements, the spit and polish that surround the game that is severely lacking good design. If you want fun big-screen family room entertainment, local split screen multi-player, racing game - go get Sonic Transformed.  If you read this far and are just looking for a single-player or online, match-making, stunt racing, beat the clock game - why did you read my review? Didn't I write at the start this wasn't the perspective? Go check out other reviews that are more your demographic. Since you're still here, all the flaws mentioned above still irk me as a designer, so I'd look for a more realistic racing game than this one if it weren't for my kids and split screen wasn't a factor.  Get it on sale, avoid it otherwise.
4606	0	a	A little disapointed with this game. Have been a fan of TM since way back in the day and this just feels like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ reboot. Menu layout is annoying and driving mechanics/physics are terrible. The tracks designs dont feel as polished compared to earlier versions of this game. I cant recommend this game, although if you are looking for a mildy entertaining time killer go for it!
4607	0	a	The game never asked me a account to play i think, but now it asks me so i create. But, after creating a account with my email the game says that my serial is in use. If i already created one account i wouldnt let me create another one with my mail. WTF?????????????????????? HOW ???????????????????????
4608	0	a	the one that noone plays
4609	0	a	this sucks
4610	0	a	Awful piece of ..... And wasn't even able to make money back.
4611	0	a	Waste of money! Got bored after 5 minutes. Really silly physics take away from a good looking game. It is too arcade for my taste.
4612	0	a	Where are you TrackMania spirit ?
4613	0	a	Pros: - OK graphics - Good for a quick game when you have little time - Ability to customize bike before each race is cool  Cons: - Extremely short - Nothing to do besides the main stages and the challenges, which give you nothing in return - Bike customization is very limited - Cheaters topping the leaderboards for every track, devs seem to not care about it - Bike sounds are repetitive and out of place, it never feels like a true engine   Overall 4.5/10  Grab it if it's in the Humble Bundle, otherwise don't pour 10€ into it, wait for a sale.
4614	0	a	Not hard enough for seasoned trials players. You play every map in 5 - 7h and are left without any replayability. Customization doesn't do enough. You can pretty much play through the whole game with just buying the best engine. Was ok for 1$ in the humble bundle, but I can't recommend paying the full price. 
4615	0	a	Remember when Trails came out? It was super hard, yet entertaining in their use of physics with tight controls and well thought out maps and levels that were hard, but managable once you mastered the controls!   Urban Trail Freestyle is just like that, if it was the same game with ugly textures, floaty controls, damn near impossible obsticles and your roommate kicking you in the beans periodically through game play.   For $.99, I got 45 minutes to an hour of playtime out of it. It's not unplayable yet it's not really enjoyable either. They tried to spice it up with a half ♥♥♥♥♥ trick system that you have absolutely no control over. The controls are sloppy at best and will lead to much swearing and teeth gnashing. I would have played through it, except for a near impossible obsticle half way through world 4 (I think) and after 15 minutes of retrying that, it dawned on me I'd have more fun going to chew tinfoil  But hey, at least it's got cards!
4616	0	a	Controls could be better. Dont like that only need to opperate with arrows, could have added jump option too. Maybe need more outfits and upgrades to bike. Simple game, nothing uber cool.  Recommend only for low price of game or if you like trial type games.
4617	0	a	It's like playing those flash bike games. A really bad copy of Trials. Don't waste your money in this game. Only if you want to have another piece of rubbish on your library, but don't pay it full price, it doesn't worth it
4618	0	a	I can't believe it has so many positive reviews.  The game mechanics are so simplistic and unresponsive. The Trials: Fusion and others of that series are well constructed games, incredibly enjoyable and challenging.  This game feels like the old school In browser Flash games. It should never have the reduced price tag of $10 / £10. The effort that was put into creating this game should leave it at only costing a maximum of £3.99 like other games that have this much effort put into them.  Unless you get it for that price or below, do not bother with this game
4619	0	a	The game seems quite fun at first, but turns out to be completely and utterly boring. Each and every stage can be completed by pressing 'up' arrow constantly, game is repetitive and visually unimpressive. Oh, and the leaderboards are populated by cheaters, so you can't even compare your score to other players. Got it from Humble Bundle, paid $1 for the whole thing, I still think I wasted that money.
4620	0	a	I was torn whether or not to recommend this game. In the end the constant/random crashing put me over the edge.   Urban Trial Freestyle isn't too bad of a game. The core things are there. The physics, upgrading your bike and the tracks are all good.   I'm running Windows 8.1 64-bit and the games stability was marginal at best. Sometimes it would crash once and then play fine for an indefinite amount of time. Other times it would crash at random over and over again and I just had to give up that day.  Not fun.   It also crashed every single time I got a Steam card for the game while playing.   I feel like the graphics engine wasn't optimized very well as I had to lower shadow settings and turn off AA. I have a GeForce GTX295. For the level of graphics in this game... it shouldn't be struggling at the max settings. I was able to get a constant 60FPS by lowering the shadow detail and turning off AA but i had to run it in 1920x1080.   Speaking of resolution. I have two 1440p monitors and i seemed to get slightly better stability when i set my resolution to match what I’d launch the game at.   It took me 10 hours to beat all the tracks, get all the cash bags and beat all the challenges.    Pros  -Nice looking graphics -Good physics -Entertaining levels   Cons  -Poorly optimized -Random/Constant crashes -Listening to the same, UNSKIPPABLE intro every time you start the game  If you get this on sale for a dollar or two, it'll give you a bit of entertainment for your money. Anything higher than that I can't recommend due to stability/performance issues.   3/10  Poor
4621	0	a	Just like all the other angle and physics racing games. This one is a bit easier than others due to track layout, and you can take a beating without falling off the bike. Fun for a little bit then gets old fast. Not as fun as the other types of similar games.
4622	0	a	Poor man's Trials - Trials is love, Trials is life.  Urban Trials on the other hand is a cardboard cutout, lowest common denominator, hold on for dear life to my superhero cape, bathe in another man's excellence, Brain Aneurysm of a game.   The physics destroy it from the off and without that theres nothing left, easy to pickup / difficult to master is replaced by hold A / RT to win. Visuals ran maxed at 1080P are 1up on a PS2, main character looks like he plays COD Ghosts.  Buy Trials Evo Gold or even Trials Fusion.
4623	0	a	All the frustration of Trials HD, none of the fun, and with added shaky screen. Just no.
4624	0	a	Trials Evolution exists, Trials Fusion exists, ♥♥♥♥ this game.  Yup, the Trials games (the real ones) are made by Evilsoft, but they are at least good games, this however is a mess that has you replaying (I'm taking a not so wild guess here after having played just over half of the game) 5-6 levels over and over again. Atrocious checkpoints on each one of those levels, and when you're racing a cpu ghost, which makes almost no mistakes, those checkpoints tend to ♥♥♥♥ you the eff off when they send you back 30 seconds. If you have this game already, let it chill in your library looking all pretty and adding that +1 to your overall game count, because that's the only thing it's good for, or torture yourself like I am, and get some playfire money if you're reading this brilliant review within a week of me writing it.  Let me paint you a clear picture, if there were such a thing as an insult chart, 'go play Urban Trial Freestyle' would be rated just above 'eat s#!t and die'.
4625	0	a	This is just a souped up polished flash game. It doesn't even come close to the Trials series. I did get it on sale for $0.99, so I'm not too disappointed. More glad I didn't shell out the $14.99 or whatever it costs regularly...
4626	0	a	If you want fun this game is not for you then,i was expecting something alse my sugar lvls jump every time i play it.But i keep coming back,so if you are noob like i am stay away from this game...
4627	0	a	This is pretty much the worst racing game I've ever played. Most of the negative reviews I read focused on the game being a Trials clone, which wouldn't offend me in the least. In fact, I found it to be more reminiscent of Trackmania. The real issue is that the bike physics are garbage, the courses aren't well designed, doing well doesn't feel rewarding, and the player's character is a dope. I'd also ding it for having your character start off naked instead of having at least basic protective gear - having to win races before you can wear a helmet is nonsensical, like so much else in this game.
4628	0	a	I can't rate this game, since it doesn't run on my PC. My pc meets the minimum requirements, but it gives up and gives an error on startup.  I just wish luck to others. Don't buy it if you don't like trials games nor cheap bad games. It 'looks' fun, but I haven't got to play it.
4629	0	a	If you are going to play this game with a KEYBOARD, chances are you won't be able to. 5 minutes into the game and the keyboard stops responding. EVERY TIME. It's a known issue, and devs apparently haven't done anything about it. It seems it was designed with gamepad (consoles?) in mind, so PC controls and settings are a mess. I would have loved to write something about the content of the game but I haven't been able to play it.  In short: UNPLAYABLE with a keyboard due to technical issues. If you find it for free you might want to grab the cards and run away
4630	0	a	To those saying that this is Trials but without uPlay: How about you actually play a Trials game.
4631	0	a	Urban Trial Freestyle is a fun little game, but compared to Trials Evolution - which it is obvious that Freestyle tried to mimic - it simply does not hold a candle. Here you have no multiplayer mode or custom track creator, the amount of tracks is disappointing, the customization system feels borderline meaningless and the gameplay feels too simple and casual. It’s not a terrible game, but it adds nothing new to the table to weigh up for its lackluster features. With better alternatives around that do everything better, Urban Trial Freestyle ends up being a pointless purchase at its current price.  2.5/5  Read more:  http://pixeljudge.com/en/reviews/urban-trial-freestyle/ 
4632	0	a	This is probley one of the worst games iv ever played!
4633	0	a	Where do I start with this game? I had purchased it during the Steam summer sale for only 99 cents. In my mind I thought 'Hmmmm how bad could this game actually be for only 99 cents?' and man, is this game bad. I loved Trials Evolution, that game was a masterpiece, but this game is nowhere near sharing the name Trials.  When launching the game and arriving at the title screen you see the hip rebelious biker dude and hear that the police are after him for tresspassing with his bike.(zZzZZZZzZZzZzz)  The gameplay of this game is not fun. Repetative levels and annyoing characters that say the same lines over and over during the levels. 'FREEZE POLICE' says the police officer as you cruise by the 10 different groups of them each level. But the funny thing is if you stop in front of the police, they dont do anything. They just roll around and act like they're going to do something as you are at a standstill.  While playing the single player, the goal is to collect the stars from each level and using them to unlock the next level. BUT, you have to play the same level 2 or 3 times playing the different 'modes' to gain the plentiful amount of stars needed.   The handling of the bike is way too easy. This game has no challenge what so ever.  I'm surprised that this game is being sold for $10 now (even at $15). If this game were still 99 cents, I would not recommend it to anyone.   In the end, this game screams of a iOS or Android game for your cellular device. How did this game make it to consoles and even steam?
4634	0	a	nope HELP ME GRAPHICS CARD NOT SUPPORTED AND I HAVE AN AMD RADEON 4200 AMD ATHOLON I MEET MINIUM SPECS HELP
4635	0	a	Won't start. Nothing to indicate that it wont work on x64 bit machines, unless I've missed something. Have tried running Steam as Admin, flushed Steam from browser, deleted the 'appcache' folder, verified integrity 100%, but none of these tasks make any difference. To add insult to injury, Steam reckons that I've played the game for 19minutes! Huh? How about 'Have tried running game for 19minutes, more like!!!  Damn, blast and a whole lot of booooooo's!!!!!!!!!
4636	0	a	Unless it you have a controller it is not gun to play. No mouse support. Graphics are horrible. Bad PC port.
4637	0	a	Doesn't even support XBOX360 Controlles.   Do not buy! Not recommended!
4638	0	a	Feels poorly ported from consoles with sluggish responses. No in-game video settings and it's going offscreen on my pretty standard resolution (1920x1080). Didn't really like the feel of the controls. Got the Humble Bundle just for this, normally like Trials. Oh well.
4639	0	a	So-so game. While i like leaderboard integrated into the track itself (you can see best results for special activities on each track, like longest jump will be shown as bar on the ground). All other aspects of game are not polished enough to enjoy it.  Gravity Defied is still the best for me (yes that old j2me game from era of phones with rows of buttons).
4640	0	a	Don't buy this game! The single player part is not in any way better than what you'll get in the Trials series (Trials evolution, Trials fusion, etc.). Also, the single player campaign in this game is monotounous and short - took me about 4 hours to complete. While the Trials series then let's you play thousands of user made tracks, for free, this game doesn't have that option. This means that you're basically spending your money on 4 hours of not very fun gameplay. Buy Trials fusion instead, it just came out, and it doesn't cost that much more.
4641	0	a	This game feels like a quick little cash grab when you compare it to Trails Evoultion Gold. It is was shorter the with no where near the same amount of levels. With no good difficulty curb for the levels as you unlock them they are all rather easy. Worst is you can tell they cut corners with repeating levels, you do a time run in a level then 2 levels later it is the exact same but with a different task. The contorl of the bikes also feels a lot less challenging making the experience less fun. No custom level maker (that i could see) shortening the life span even more so. If you're going to buy a Trails game your money will be better spent on Trails Evoultion Gold.
4642	0	a	Even though I got it knowing that it would be a very simple and very casual game, I still can't recommend it.  The gameplay is somewhat what I expected. I played the heck out of those free 2d bike trial browser games. And I expected the gameplay to be similar, and I wasn't wrong. But despite the graphics and fireworks, Urban Trial Freestyle manages to be more simpel and to dumb down the 2d free browser games.  One of the main problems, imho, are the levels. They are too simple, too short, too unchallenging. Yes the random challenges are cool (highest jump, longest jump, whatever), but truth still is that you spend most of the (very short) level pressing accelerator and watching the fireworks.   But the main problem for me was: It gave me massive motion sickness. I've made sure to have 60hz stable, vsync, I've played with other settings, no joy. I'm not sure if it's the 2.5d concept or if it's something else in the graphics or optimization but the bottom line is... I just can't play it. And I'm actually a bit glad about it.  I've asked for a refund but I doubt I'm getting it. At least it was dirt-cheap.
4643	0	a	Even after buying this on Summer Steam Sale, I now wonder 'why'? This is the typical balance-your-vehicle-across-the-ramps type of game. There are so many like this, only this might look better. If you are not a hardcore fan of these kind of games, avoid if you want to keep your calm and save your keyboard from getting thrown to the wall.
4644	0	a	What I expected: a third person driving game, much like ATV: Offroad Fury, but dirt bikes on rooves. What I got: A side scroller arcade style driving game with boring challenges and even more boring gameplay. But hell, it was $.99

4646	0	a	Worst game ever! You will die at least 25 times on each map to take 2 or maximum 3 stars from 5 stars.
4647	0	a	Useless copy of a good game. Bugged and glitched as ♥♥♥♥. Spend your 0.99£ on some other crap. Jesus
4648	0	a	i don't know why do i have to collect the stars and unlock different maps like what i'm doing in the mobile phone games. Can i pay the money to unlock these maps? Actually this game is just a mini game, you don't have many choices on choosing the style of your motor bike and your cloth ( maybe you can unlock more, because i didn't finish this whole game ), so i don't know why do they call it 'Freestyle'.  In other words, it only costs 99 cents, and has awesome graphics. it was really cool as i thought when i was playing it at first time. But then, i started getting tired to play the map again, again and again and still can't get enough stars ( damn skill ). i was impatient and hoped to play every map in this game quickly. it's vain, and it's why this game had low rating. If you are a stubborn warrior and want to beat these hard challanges, just try it. Me? Just surrendering.
4649	0	a	You like Trials HD? Well, This is not like that. This is terrible.
4650	0	a	This games controls make me sick. When I purchased this game I wasn't expecting another Trials but I was hoping for a similar experience. This game just feels like a flash game. Thank god I only got it for $0.99.
4651	0	a	Don't be fooled by the glamorous graphics and the shiney levels.... This game subtly reminds me of one of those crappy ps2 games that you are so siked for and end up becoming disappointed after the first few levels. First off the levels make no sense... you ride on a pipe and jump to a platform that launches you into a container that either A. ends up killing you, enabling you to hit the spacebar ( this becomes your friend ) or B. exit out of the game in a furious rage. The upgrading abilities are far from satisfying. You can upgrade your engine at the price of having worse handling, or you can upgrade your chassis at the price of having slower speeds. There is always something for something and there's only 3 upgrades per area. Getting money to upgrade is far from 'fun' ( not sure why fun is quoted ... maybe because that's more fun than getting money in this game ). I digress ... the money is located in bags throughout each level. You can only collect them once. That is the only way it is obtained. You can spend your money on helmets and clothes, but then you won't have any for engines, tires, or chassis. Some areas of levels are impassable unless under some freak of nature miracle that you hit something a certain way to do something to get you passed it. The constant reminder that someone online has trumped your score and that you keep getting either 3 stars or 4 stars average is also very demeaning and makes you feel like the whole game is an unsuccesful attempt to have fun. It's almost like you are excited to go on vacation with your family and they end up just making you more miserable than your 9-5 job. If you think I just don't like the game because I can't play it then try it for yourself. You'll realize...
4652	0	a	The physics utterly suck. Make it nearly unplayable. Going up a hill, you'd think you need to lean forward? Nope. Not leaning means you'll flip backward, and leaning forward means your bike will flip forward suddenly and *very* unnaturally, forcing a loss of all grip immediately. Trials does this too, but WAY more natural and physically believable.  Coming from Trials Evolution, the physics here are a joke.
4653	0	a	DUMB AND EDGY  I picked this game up on humble, because I like the trials games from Ubisoft. This is not like a trials game from Ubisoft. You basically drive in a straight line through edgytopia, where edgy things happen all around you but don't really affect you driving straight. There are few upgrades, and half the levels are the same as the other half, except that they add ghost drivers. The motorcycle noises are annoying. It's just all around bad... not worth the dollar I paid for the bundle.
4654	0	a	TL;DR What a terrible game.   Got this on a Humble Bundle, and thats the only time its ever worth considering. It starts as a simple 'bike balance' flash game, but sadly manages to mess up what hundreds of flash games seem to pull off.   The backgrounds are too busy to say the least, Barely a level goes by without a helicopter crash, a tanker explosion or some part of Michael Bay's wet dreams. With all this going on, focusing on you non-descript rider (who looks like Techno Viking straight out of the box) becomes challenging.   The graphics themselves are massively dated, and wouldn't look out of place on a PS2 or original Xbox, which make the aforementioned backgrounds even more of an eyesore.   Then theres the sounds, with the bike sounding like an irritated wasp in a tin can, the tin-like explosion, and the 4 soundbites of 'cops' (which are purely backdrops, serving no actual threat to the player) shouting 'freeze' or 'hey you'.   All in all, if you want to play a balance game, find a flash game. It'll be a lot cheaper, a lot better, and not have you reaching for headache tablets.
4655	0	a	Well, yeah, ok. You might want to punch your monitor or your keyboard sometimes but it's ok. Games like this do this to you, right? Got it in a bundle for 1 euro along with 2 other games. Totally worth its 33 cents. Not a chance I'd put 10 euros into this.   TL;DR: Buy it if it's ever on discount for like 1 euro. Do NOT buy at full price. Ever.
4656	0	a	If you buy it for 0,99€ it forth it but not for 9,99€. This game is rly not intresting, grafics its greait but you can't see when you playing any of it so it becoming rly shity expirienc. But as i said if you wan't to have not that intresting game for 0,99€ you should buy it. I both and not playing.
4657	0	a	Blatant ripoff, leeching off the success of the Trials series. Awful controls, leaving you feeling not entirely in control and a general all round feeling of cheapness. Avoid, unless you're a masochist with too much cash.
4658	0	a	4/10
4659	0	a	Don't bother with this game. It could be $0.00 and you would still be getting the short end of the stick. A game with poor graphics, minimalist controls and sub-par general gameplay. You use 4 keys the whole game and I am quite sure that you could go through the whole game using 2 keys. No real story is present within the game and you are just left to run over obstacles through a city all day. 100% do not reccomend this game to anybody.
4660	0	a	Says trials, not trials, would not freestyle again  2.5/5
4661	0	a	this game is utterly ♥♥♥♥ never buy it nor play it the creator obviously have no ♥♥♥♥ing clue what physics are as the god damn game has the ♥♥♥♥♥est of them. This game is so terrible that the customization to the bike is liquid ♥♥♥♥ as all you do is make a bike that is the fastest as 99% of all the stupid ♥♥♥♥ needed to get stars require a ♥♥♥♥ load of speed to even get enough poitns to do.the frotn wheel has 0 weight which si ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ as ♥♥♥♥ sicne you end up flipnig over more times then anything and cant go up hills for ♥♥♥♥ sicne your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game designer buddy didnt know how to ♥♥♥♥ MAKE THE FRONT WHEEL USE THE ENGINE! may aswell have made the bike not evne have a god damn frotn wheel sicne 95% of the god damn tiem you goto move you pratically flip off the damn thing backwards not to mention they add ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ puzzles and hazards that make this games ♥♥♥♥ mechnnics even worse! 0/10 don't buy it its seriosuly soemthing you could go get out of a freebie flash game

4663	0	a	Doesn't work with Xbox One controller (constantly accelerates when connected) so have to power off the controler and switch to keyboard as controller takes priority.  Unplayable with Xbox One controller...
4664	0	a	I played this game for a while. While i like this type of games this one is just boring.  The art for this game is dark and a bit boring. The maps itself aren't very different or entertaining.  I can't really type anything more about this game. Just boring. I recommend you Trials Fusion more than this.
4665	0	a	At the time of this writing, does not support 4K under Windows 7 (see  bug report ).  Quite fun for the rest.  Not recommending until 4K issue is fixed.
4666	0	a	Inferior clone of the Trials series. Unreasonable goal times, crappy bikes, fuzzy graphics, unmemorable music. It's just bland all around.
4667	0	a	A less entertaining version of trials that manages to be completely uninteresting in every way.   
4668	0	a	Feels like a very cheap immitation of the Trials series. Don't really recommend this one.
4669	0	a	I got the world record in platform madness and they reset it. WTF URBAN TRIAL?
4670	0	a	this game is awful 10/10 -IGN
4671	0	a	This game can't work properly with both xbox 360 and xbox one controllers. The game keep registering the right trigger. Both controllers worked perfectly with other games so the issue is not caused by the controllers.
4672	0	a	Simple fun, simple game for simple mind. Not worth 10€ unless sale -90% 
4673	0	a	Worst 99 cents ever spent.

4675	0	a	Urban Trial Freestyle is a poor mans Trials HD/Evolution the general feel of the motorbike make it seem quite heavy whereas although Trials felt sometimes like you were bouncing all over the place at least that was useful for harder obstacles. This game offer just like 6 different stages that don't seem to get any harder so there's not really a learning curve which is quite disappointing froma game that wants to compete with Trials, its just getting from point a to b  Its incredibly easy and doesn't explain the objectives very well which are scattered around in certain levels. It hides moneybags around the level to improve your bike, because thats a great system find the collectibles so you can accomplish the objectives to a higher degree. The level design isn't fantastic either where some obstacles don't properly align with others.   There's alot going on in the background but when you're trying to focus on what your bikes doing the background action can a little jarring and distracting. Graphically its pretty much the same as Trials. Really the only benefit is at least you don't have to use Uplay but this is such a mediocre game, get Trials really get Trials its not a very good port but its still better than this.
4676	0	a	no remappable controls. terribad physics
4677	0	a	Okay concept combined with cool dynamic maps, held together by a horrible PC port and rubbishy vehicle upgrade systems.. the game doesn't really hold any explanations of how to play, it has the absolute WORST feel of any game I have ever played (no decent background music, just the horrible tinny sound of your bike, which sounds like a nitrous buggy that has been burned out), and to top it all off the game is quite short. Definitely would not recommend, even after buying during a sale for $4.
4678	0	a	I bought this for 99c thinking it'd be the dollar store version of Trials. Well ... it is, but it's actually worse that that. It's kind of like playing Trials if they hired the physics dude from Bad Rats to design the bike contols. Some levels have some interesting design, but it doesn't matter becuase of the 'Absolutley Terrible Gameplay' feature they added, but forgot to mention on the store page.  Stay ... away ... seriously.
4679	0	a	just... no. please. listen to me. do not buy this. please. do not play this for free. stay away. just... avoid this forever. dear god. please. i'm beggin you.
4680	0	a	what is this even
4681	0	a	This is like Trials, minus everything that makes Trials fun. The graphics are decent, and the level design is kinda cool... but the bike physics are terrible. That pretty much ruins everything else.
4682	0	a	Worst biking game ever. If you want a good game, get any Trials. This game is worse than the worst game in the world. It is a dark motorbiking game that has to be backed up with a 'Child Friendly' piece of ♥♥♥♥.   DO NOT BUY THIS, it sucks ♥♥♥♥.
4683	0	a	Rather buy trials fusion this is a husk of a trials game. Repeats levels over and over. Graphics are meh at best. No multiplayer.
4684	0	a	mite b fun if it didn't stutter so severely every few seconds that it ♥♥♥♥s with your eyes  eye-strain/10 would play if i wanted a migraine
4685	0	a	Not terrible, but the older titles of the series were more fun. Can't figure out specifically why, they just feel better and more responsive. Even went back to play an older one to make sure it wasn't only nostalgia, just can't reccomend this one.
4686	0	a	Cheap rip off of Trials. Do not buy.
4687	0	a	this gam was ver good but no alot of game play i 100% gam in 7 minot but i had god time
4688	0	a	Steer clear. One of the most badly built games I've ever seen. Where is the refund section?
4689	0	a	I thought it was a new Trials game. I should have researched more... Don't get this game. Just stick with the real Trials games.
4690	0	a	Gave me special person DLC. I am not special. I am offended
4691	0	a	Really trash. The screenshots look cool and all - but it's a 2D game. UP and DOWN to move. Left and right to lean (forward or back). Not challanging. Really bad game.
4692	0	a	Let's start with the only pro that I have found: The dynamic level design can be interesting at times.  Now on to the cons : Graphically lacking, gameplay is stiff and unresponsive, the levels may be interesting but you need to play each one twice, childishly easy, virtually no customization, not fun.  I bought this game expecting it to at least resemble Trials Evolution: Gold Edition (an infinitely better game of the same style) and was sorely disappointed. The $3.74 that I paid for this game was too much. All around a bad game. 3/10
4693	0	a	Worst ♥♥♥♥ing game ever. I bought it in 75% sale but I still want my money back you ♥♥♥♥♥♥. Buy Trials Evolution instead.
4694	0	a	worthless. The feeling is completely wrong. You actually have better feeling in the bike on the facebook game Trial Xtreme 3... Hope the guys who made this feel embarassed. Not worth the money even though it was very cheap.
4695	0	a	What I just played was one of the most insanely idiodic things I've ever experienced. At no point during play was this game even close to anything that could be considered fun. I am now dumber, having played it. I award this game a 0/10 and may God have mercy on my soul.
4696	0	a	I bought this because it was on sale and i love the Trials series, but this is is just crap, you cant costumize for ♥♥♥♥. Tracks are OK but its overall bad. Trails Evo is superior compared to this. I dont recomend buying this game.
4697	0	a	Shoulda bought MX vs. ATV.
4698	0	a	Not as good as excpeted.
4699	0	a	Constantly crashes to desktop
4700	0	a	I would never buy this ♥♥♥♥ for 10 bucks. Thank god it was on sale. Cause this is really bad.
4701	0	a	WOW... this is one BIG old pile of buggy S-HIT!   Buy this if you like feeling ripped off and unhappy.
4702	0	a	No, this is absolute ♥♥♥♥♥. Solid bad-quality rip of the usual Trials games.
4703	0	a	Uninstalled so fast
4704	0	a	Until you're a lover of ridiculously difficult 2D flash trial arcade games, stay away from this game.
4705	0	a	It is just a bad console port
4706	0	a	Errors. Errors. Errors. on 3 different PC-es. with really high specs.
4707	0	a	Expected this to be a Trials HD clone, got a poor example of a trials HD clone instead. Lack of analog throttle/brake controlls shows a vast inferiority to what the game claims to be. Audio was shoddy at best. Only pro to this was I picked it up basically for free in a humble bundle.
4708	0	a	it sucks
4709	0	a	This game is compared to Trials a lot. And it is very much like it with a few changes. But these changes, in my opinion, are bad. In some tracks you are supposed to go for points by doing things like getting the highest jump. It changes things up which is nice. You do the next track and it's either getting points or a time trial. Then after that, you repeat the previous track doing a time trial this time. It's like the developers think you're three years old and can't notice you're playing the same track twice.  You would expect the bike to control well. But it doesn't it's very hard to turn correctly. You can upgrade your bike but that just makes it even worse. Some obstacles in the game are incredibly hard to pass. Some of the obstacles hardly ever work. And sometimes a car that it supposed to stop in a certain spot wont stop there making you fall. Or a car will stop in the middle of the road when it's not supposed to. This is completely random and you have no way to control it. The hard obstacles combined with the horrible controlls make the game extremely frustrating to the point where you quit.  The game doesn't let you progress very easily. Each track has 5 stars to get. The number of stars you get depends on your performance on the track. By the time I was halfway into world three I had three or more stars on every track. But I still didn't have enough stars to unlock more tracks. It is very hard for players who aren't good at the game to progress.  I payed 99 cents for this game and I still feel like I was ripped off. Don't buy this game. It's a waste of time and money.
4710	0	a	worth what you pay at the summer sale but you only will get about 10 min of enjoyable playtime out of it.
4711	0	a	I was expecting it to be like trials hd. 3/10 Would not reccomend
4712	0	a	1 word! shocking! glad i only payed 0.69p even then its not worth it
4713	0	a	The physics are just average and the controls are sluggish. And it only has 47 levels, half of which are unique, because each level has a Time Attack and Best Score mode in the level select. After a hour of playing I was already at the last world. Buy only if it's on a sale or if you're a HUGE trials fan.
4714	0	a	I normally don't really care that much when a game draws a LOT of inspiration from another, but this is just abysmal. It's essentially a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ version of Trials, some of the tracks are decently designed but the actual physics of the bike (y'know, that thing that the entire game is based around) are heavy, clunky, and awkward. I got this game on sale for a buck and I still feel ripped off. Do not buy this game.
4715	0	a	its  a poor mans Trials  a very poor mans Trials...........but for 69p you get what you pay for. Controlling the bike is not that challenging and takes a lot of the fun away, if you cant/have not played Trials you will enjoy it otherwise give it a miss
4716	0	a	♥♥♥♥ it was 99 cents. and total crap   0.1/10
4717	0	a	Play Trials for free online.
4718	0	a	Go download Uplay and get HD/Evolution/Fusion because this is not worth your time nor your money.
4719	0	a	The 'race against a ghost of the record holder' feature is kind of cool for aspiring D-list Steam celebrities, but this game will become repetitive and unsightly to anyone other than the most die hard of motocross or Trials fans.
4720	0	a	Don't buy this game! It locks up randomly and the only thing you can do is shut down your computer. NO support, in fact they delete bad reviews and any forum posts that say negative things about them. Again, DON'T BUY THIS GAME!!
4721	0	a	this is just a terrible entry of an awesome series. no track editor what the hell. also very few levels almost not worth the 99 cents i paid for it
4722	0	a	It's more or less the knock off Trials game....
4723	0	a	At first this game was good but then I noticed some really bad things about it. Pros -Challanges like highest jump or farthest flip lots of fun Middles -Interactions with the environment are cool but can be worked on Cons -ONLY ONE PRO -Graphics pretty bad  -no skill required just up arrow and right arrow holding -attempt at story but comes off as cheesy cliché and boring -not much customization -only 12 achievments Overall Just give me my trading cards and leave
4724	0	a	I paid .59 CAD for this. Got what I paid for.
4725	0	a	This game isn't fun to play. You will be better off saving up for Trails Evolution.
4726	0	a	For a game I paid 0.99 for its okay, anything hogher then that your just wasting your money
4727	0	a	Looking for another EPIC tilty bike game? Look somewhere else. This game isn't about skill or tilting, it's about fancy backgrounds and holding down the acceleration. You may occasionally need to tilt but thats in very specific and obvious places. Oh but there are so many levels! Except that every few levels are exactly (They ARE and look 100% the same) the same as the one you played 3 levels ago. You are playing an identical clone to the same level! SO MUCH FUN. And don't forget the baddass things your character says every couple seconds! 'Feel my wrath! Not!'. Eergh I feel hardcore just typing it. And the customization... Oh dear god.  So why should you buy this game? You shouldn't unless it's on sale for $2 and you really enjoy not having to do anything in games. Otherwise skip it.
4728	0	a	I wouldn't buy this game full price. I got it for 99 cents, which isn't a bad deal. However, the game has bad fps lag which really takes away from the gameplay imo. Other than that the game is exactly what you expect. I bought this game as a substitute for Trials: Revolution on the xbox. I thought I would get a game similar but of a little lesser quality so I didn't expect alot.
4729	0	a	It reminds me a lot of free flash games of the same style with less features, to me it wasn't worth buying as it doesn't have half the features you would expect from a game of this style no jump, no upgrades etc... the graphics are not entirely overwhelming either, the game levels remind me of some platform games from the 80's and 90's.   It also doesn't register that i've completed several levels and no steam achievements have been earned for playing the game.
4730	0	a	Horrible physics, horrible graphics and horrbile game play. Biggest waste of 70p ever
4731	0	a	Not to be confused with the more enjoyable (and more expensive) game in the Trials franchise.
4732	0	a	Decent graphics. The game is just borring. You can find similiar games for free that are much more enjoyable. Levels are uninspired and quite a bit depends on pure luck. Do not recomend to buy for full price.
4733	0	a	Average game. On my oppinion not worth 10€. But anyways, i got it for 1€, so i don't care :P
4734	0	a	Sorry but if you think this game understands momentum then you should probably seek help. It's not an awful game no but it's nothing special I'll say that right off the line. If you want to be infuriated because of the lack of momentum then this game is for you. Not awful but not great. Worth 69p like it's being sold for in this sale.
4735	0	a	poor mans trials game level design and mechanics are worse then trials way worse this game is like one of those android ripoff trials games
4736	0	a	Urban Trial Freestyle is a very bad port with terrible performance issues and no reboundable controls. You can't use the mouse on anything which would be nice to use instead of the control scheme that isn't well thought out (function keys to navigate). Despite stating that, the game definitely feels a lot better with a controller which shouldn't be the case considering I am playing on a PC. The level design seems to get distracting sometimes due to objects blending in making me miss a crucial jump. The bikes feel very unnatural which also ruins the game for me. All this being said, the only recommendation I can make is the price it is on sale for and for a dollar, you get a game that you can spend short amounts of time on but for full price, Urban Trial Freestyle is 100% not worth it.
4737	0	a	I was hoping for some kind of freestyle dirtbike game on par with DiRT. This is a lot more like Motocross Maniacs for the Game Boy, except MM was a little more open about how you could attack a track. This is linear--it's literally linear, you cannot steer left or right, and most tracks have three or four score zones and that's about it. So much for freestyle when you're only scored on how well you score in each of the designated zones, and how quickly you get through a track.  The environments do look cool, and the interactions are kind of fun, but in general I feel like something's missing from the game, like it's a minigame from a much bigger, better dirtbike game.
4738	0	a	this game can be fairly frustrating, alot of games are trail and error and let u experiment with different strategies for winning or in these types of games u expirement with different ways to approach each obstacle. But in this game alot of the time u gotta make the right choices straight from the beginning of the level or your whole run is going to be bad. there has also been many times were i die on an obstacle over and over and when i finally get passed said obstacle i don't even know how i did it most of the time. Or if u buy one or two things in the store that you werent supposed to ur not going to be able to afford the biggest engine. and if u don't have the biggest engine u dont have a chance at beating this game. becausealmost all of the challenges depend on speed. thers straight up speed tests, highest jump tests and flip test and u need speed for all of them. and the worst part is if u made a few bad investments at the start of the game getting money will be very difficult later on because you will need speed to even reach the money bags to unlock more parts. i give it 4/10 atleast it did'nt cost much...
4739	0	a	was only priced at $0.99 and i am still sadly disapointed it cost me that much, not nearly as satisfying or technically designed and developed as the game Trials. very singular gameplay. dont even have the option of changing your controls, i knew i would not be able to hook up a controller but not even being able to change which buttons i wanted to use on the keyboard seems like big thing in such a simple game
4740	0	a	One of the worst Trial games, honestly.
4741	0	a	dont buy any of the DLC's cuz they just make your character look awesome with no work
4742	0	a	I got this game free from my friend and tried it, it really sucks lol Bored game, just bike all around and there are mission that are too hard to pass for beginners I do not recommend this.
4743	0	a	not good at all i would recomend trial fusion if you want a trial biking game =[
4744	0	a	I'll be honest, it's very basic, and I don't want to spend any more of my time writing about or playing this game, get Trials Evolution, whilst I have no major issues with this game other than the physics feeling a bit amateur. ultimately it lacks fun!  3/10 At a push
4745	0	a	game looks nice but if works correctly .. it hangs every time i ran it .. keyboard stops responding .. game video is running but no key input from keyboard .. even ctrl+alt+del dont work .. only solution is to press reset button to restart PC ..  dont know what is the problem .. but this kingd of basic thing not working for game cant make me recommend it to anyone !! .. buy it at your own risk !!
4746	0	a	glad i got it from bundle and didnt waste more money on that.. simple, stupid and pointless :P
4747	0	a	grind to make enough to upgrade one part only to find that upgrading your engine downgrades handling. and upgrading handling downgrades the engine. and upgrading top speed downgrades handling. the levels are garbage and i'm pretty sure the simplicity of this game will make me worse at actual trails games. thanks for costing me money and downgrading my abilities in other games. never had to pay for that before.
4748	0	a	So, it's alright, I wouldn't lay 10$ on it.... Good thing I didn't. It's pretty funny, but the tracks themselves are way easy, the difficulty comes in beating the high scores. Sadly it's pretty obvious that cheaters are in the leaderboards, since their replays show them taking forever cause they're pretty ♥♥♥♥ at a pretty easy game. Pick it up while still on sale, otherwise you won't be to satisfied.
4749	0	a	game keeps going to desktop when launch bruh
4750	0	a	it is worth it if it is .99 but not 10.00
4751	0	a	Even on sale it doesn't make up for the fact that this game still SUCKS!
4752	0	a	I tought it was in multiplayer :/  
4753	0	a	Not even worth the 99 cents. It's like 5 of the same stages played over and over with different tasks.
4754	0	a	wtf is this
4755	0	a	i dont recomend it. Not fun. i played for a couple minutes and hated the controls and hated how the game was designed.
4756	0	a	Meh. Came reccommended, but It's no excitebike. Physics are too real (weight) to have fun with it. If you don't start a flip at the right speed, you will not be able to complete it, no matter how you fiddle the balance control.
4757	0	a	While you can still have fun with this game is undeniable that it has a lot of problems. Starting from the stars progression system to the way you're supposed to earn money to buy bike upgrades that do not seems to have a real impact on the game. The level design is good in general but sometimes you come across certain spots where it's only a matter of luck, resulting in extreme frustration.   I can't recommend this
4758	0	a	Edit: Oh this is lovely, like all indie developers who get bad reviews, the two for this game both gave me 'did not find this review useful' then now told me that the reason I found the campaign to be repetative was because I hadn't played it enough yet. What total nonsense. They claimed that playing death matches or capture the flag would make the game more fun. I played both (specifically where I said 'Multiplayer games against bots') and they were still not fun.   Edit 2: I've checked the steam page for Gas Guzzlers and there's not one negative review with over 50% of people who found it useful.Huge redflag. Out of a 100 negatives reviews there's none with constructive criticism deemed useful ? I call BS.  I'm giving this a thumbs down because I don't believe its worth the $24.99 price tag.   At first, the game is a lot of fun and its really satisfying when you blow up your first car. The problem is that this is one of the most repetitive games I've ever played.  You'll end up in first most the time, trying to decide whether you should slam the breaks to kill people and break the monotany or just go for an easy win.  The 'campaign' consists of  1. Race with no weapons  2. Race with weapons 3. Race with weapons, but whoever is in last place gets taken out at the end of each lap.  4. Play multiplayer games against bots when the game decides its a special occassion.  You'll play dozens of these races and feel like you aren't getting anywhere.  New cars don't unlock often enough to keep things interesting, a sponsorship insures that you'll have about 5x as much money as you can possibly use, and its just agonizingly boring to win 5 races and be told CONGRATULATIONS! YOU UNLOCKED....1 NEW RIM AND 1 NEW STICKER!   This game is fun for about an hour or two, but around the time you reach the first championship, you'll start to ask yourself why you're wasting your time driving in circles (alwasy in first place) when you could be playing Twisted Metal, Mad Max, or any number of car combat games.
4759	0	a	Don't trust the preview videos... This isn't the no-holds vehicular combat game it's made out to be: it's a racer... and a bland one at that.  There is no real choice of vehicles, since each new car is a straight upgrade to the former. There is no real choice between maneuverability and speed -or any other factor, for that matter, like armor or weaponry.  Gas Guzzlers isn't a bad game, but it doesn't have enough to it tobe interesting past the first 15 minutes.
4760	0	a	I can't stand this one. At first I considered giving a detailed point by point, but this title just isn't worth my time. Not worth it to play, not worth it to go in depth. I'll skim the surface.  Gas Guzzlers Extreme is what it is, a brainless party racer with boring/unrewarding controls, poor track layouts, and a consistently tasteless sense of humor bashing users over the head at every turn. It's a game where gently nudging somebody off the track is far more effective than pounding them for half a lap with automatic weaponry. More frustrating than fun.  That said, the game does look pretty good, has a decent number of race modes, and the career progression seems pretty well put together. Even though it's got those premium ingredients, Gas Guzzlers Extreme is let down when they come together and provides a below-average experience overall. I can picture the game having an audience--everything does. For some, there is surely fun to be had here, but it isn't for me, and I wouldn't recommend it.
4761	0	a	Initially quite fun, but it gets dull fast. You quickly unlock most of the useful stuff, and after that it feels too repetitive. I imagine multiplayer would give it a significant boost, but it was dead whenever I tried.
4762	0	a	Actually it is 50/50 game. It got cars and gunz, is should be fun! Yes ? Nooo! Unfortunately it's booring. Cars look similar and handles identically. There are few useless upgrades. Nothing stands out.
4763	0	a	Massively overrated and overpriced game, even in a steam sale. After playing the grid, gt, burnout game, this game feels tired and washed out after 5-10 minutes of gameplay. The action is just monotonous and repetitive,   I mean the graphics are kind of nice, 8/10, but it just lacks style or artistic quality. It just feels like, the entire game was written to do the minimum amount of work to please a manager. It just doesn't feel like anyone's soul went into this game.  Basically this is wipeout 2097, but wipeout 2097 had better style, concept and art. Even though wipeout's graphics is far more pixelated than this, it's a far more enjoyable game.  It just feels like there is something central missing from this game, and I just can't put my finger on what.
4764	0	a	A bad racing game. It's a fun combat game but the driving is so floaty and janky that it's borderline unplayble.  Real shame since it has quite a bit of content: - Normal Racing - Battle racing (racing with weapons) - Knockout racing + weapons - Capture the Flag - Battle Arena  But because of terrible car handling the game is pretty much unplayble. Just go get flatout 2 instead.
4765	0	a	I thought the game was great for the first little while, but then I just started blowing up for no reason. I would be winning, full hp, no cars around me and the game would just blow my car up and say 'KNOCKED OUT' continually through all levels after a certain point in the second series. After not being able to figure out what was going on, if it was some glitch, I tried using the godmode cheat I found online. Even still, my car would randomly explode for no reason and I would lose races. I wouldn't recommend this title because of this game breaking and incredibly frequent glitch. Really, really disappointing. I will probably never finish it because of this.
4766	0	a	Bought during holiday sale, was very interested to try it since it's a developer from my country. Turns out, the game is extremely laggy even on the lowest settings, the cars are absolutely uncontrolable and while they look pretty shiny and all, the enviroment looks very low-poly and bad. Flatout 2 is a much better game even though it's older. The 'humor' is forced and on the level of a 5 year old.  And to think I could have bought The Talos Principle for the same money instead.

4768	0	a	Game was bought and installed from a disc but will not play it will not let me get pass the profile screen. it states that the microsoft visual C ++ is 2010 and clearly my laptop is of a higjer version. was so looking forward to playing this game.
4769	0	a	Was expected way more fun with this game. Gamepad support (Xbox 360's in my case) is next to non-existent - can't drop mines you use any specials :( Also, the gamepad works awfully in the menus, and I have to reach for the mouse. Gameplay is very repetitve and after you have flawlessly lead for a few laps (pickin' and usin' all the nitros) competitors suddenly start gaining on you by the end of the game. WTF???
4770	0	a	Bad game to me and friends.  We experienced broken physics, questionable mechanics, poor ping on the available servers (officially hosted), races were not fun at all due to the lack of smart racing mechanics mentioned above), multiplayer interface (and interface in general) is poor as well.  Best part about it appears to be the singleplayer which is extremely cheesy but has nice a nice flow if you accept and like the simpleton style.  It does have bots in multiplayer - which is positive since even though multiplayer was relatively dead (only about 2-3 players at prime time on the level relevant server) it can be played.  Co-op though? Not even close. It's your typical team based multiplayer (CTF, TDM) and there is no co-op option anywhere in the game. Seeing how the devs interpret co-op explains the overall lack of quality in the game. It's your typical 'we've made a team multiplayer, let's call it co-op' thing. Also not enough players to fill up two teams. In conclusion it looks and feels like a poor mashup of Blur, Flatout etc. Only recommended to genre fans.   Recommended price point: 5$ 
4771	0	a	This game isn't all it's hyped up to be. The FPS drops every time I start a race. It goes back up but keeps fluctuating. It even lacks a split-screen option which is one of the main reasons I play car battle games. There's nothing particularly bad about the gameplay, overall it's solid but don't expect anything groundbreaking, it's all been done in other games before.   For the price, I certainly would'nt recommend this game to anyone. For avid fans, I'd say the game might be worth 20$ with all DLCs but if you're just a casual gamer you might want to look into something else.
4772	0	a	It does NOT have local couch multiplayer, despite the video showing 4 way split screen. Whal the hell... The gameplay itself is sluggish
4773	0	a	Driveing controls suck Fix turning!!!! 
4774	0	a	I don't even know where to start, this game is just ♥♥♥♥ing awful in every single way possible. +1 point for x64 support tho.
4775	0	a	Bought it on sale and I still regret it. Total garbage. Ammunition is EXTREMELY scarce, the AI cheats...
4776	0	a	Open game. Watch opening. Create Driver. *CRASHES*
4777	0	a	i didn't get it. bought this game, because of the very positive reviews. but i dont get warm with this game. for me, it isn't any fun.
4778	0	a	Just couldn't get into it. Terrible controls. Uninstalled after about an hour. Very shallow, and not nearly as fun as it would seem.
4779	0	a	No australian servers  No players  Horrible driving physics
4780	0	a	A truly great game made by a great developer, however i cannot give this game a thumbs up from the experience that i have had so far.  Sadly the game uses direct x9 which is fine, however despite it being a game produced in 2013, direct x 11 doesnt exist exist for the game.  This however is nothing in comparison to the games stability as it constantly crashes no matter how hard i try, the 64 bit version of the game is very unstable and sometimes crashes on launch and the fps of the game is sometimes woeful for its age and graphics, the game can often feel very sluggish in reguards to the gameplay and the frames can suffer realy badly.  If you dont believe me, just search it up. The community have posted about this for years and the developers seem to be either ignoring the issues or taking way to long to fix them, especially as they have only just released a christmas match which is a sad sign that this wont ever be fixed :(
4781	0	a	GOD AWFUL CONTROLS!!!!!  Super Mario Kart has way better controls then this, and that game allowed you to move straight down the track. this game is nothing more then bobble heading all the way through(left, then right, repeat), it basically does it the way I had to do in order to slowdown/stop my snowmobile when going down a hill with no breaks.   Not recommened.
4782	0	a	WARNING: Do not buy this game if you want to play in split screen . The video game gives the impression of being local multiplayer with split screen, but actually is not . The game looks good, but just bought to be able to have fun in family . I made the return of the same .  ATENÇÃO: Não compre esse jogo se quiser jogar em divisão de tela. Pelo vídeo o jogo passa a impressão de ser multijogador local com divisão de tela, porém na verdade não é. O jogo parece ser bom, mas só comprei para poder me divertir em familia. Fiz a devolução do mesmo.
4783	0	a	this game when try launch game gave you black anytime you try play this game and you have turn off computer get windows back you guys need fix this problem
4784	0	a	Doesn't work with steam controller. Tried top 5 configs. Got the game plus all the DLC and was a total waste of time and money.  EDIT: Devel team says its steam keeping them from supporting the steam controller. Not sure whats going on here, but the end result is I can't play the game. I hope steam and the devel team and figure out how to make ♥♥♥♥ work. The game looks great and I want to play it.
4785	0	a	The problem with this game is when the levels get harder your car stops work correctly and yet all the AI cars can turn and get grip. Its not a level field and when your car doesnt do what it has been doing you get frustrated . The game is not programmed smartly. Half ♥♥♥♥♥ attampt at at shooter driver. Even with the 4 gig upgrade this game is just frustrating
4786	0	a	It's unfortunate that a game which seems like it is tailor made for playing in the living room with friends simply refuses to work with Steam Link and controllers.  I bought the game because it promised 'full controller support' but nothing I can do will allow me to use my XBOX wireless controllers while streaming the game to my TV via the Link box.  Yes, I have used this set up successfully with multiple other games.
4787	0	a	I've give this game a 'meh'.. Luckily I only paid $5.60 CDN as it was on sale. The reviews for this game were so compelling, I had to buy it, but I feel ripped off, eventhough I only paid 5 buks.  I give this game a 60/100. The graphics are ok, the driving feel is not that great. A game similar to this with better graphics, better driving feel, and overal realism is Flatout: Ultimate Carnage.  I dont know why this game is given such high reviews, honestly its just not that good.  Don't buy it, unless you are dying for a new game and only pay next to nothing.
4788	0	a	for me it constantly lags. Not happy with it but if you want to get it, by all means try it out. Maybe it is just my computer xD 
4789	0	a	Buy Flatout ....
4790	0	a	It gets boring after getting all cars. People compare it to mario kart and say it's very similar but with guns. I agree, but they left out something very important: the replayability. I remember having countless hours on mario kart after I unlocked everything, but for this game I just can't replay it. If you haven't noticed, most people who vote positive and compare it to mario kart have less hours than me in this game. I only have 6.9, imagine if you played more.
4791	0	a	The handling of the car is weird. Not as much fun as Blur, Flatout 2, or Split/Second. Just play the demo before buying.
4792	0	a	absolutely NO controller support
4793	0	a	This game is a cool idea just ruined by the makers They have made the AI so stupid: - Travel faster than you - have unlimited ammo - Suddenly have a large acceleration period if you are slightly ahead - You die so fast to them - Follow you around an arena when you are low on health - act like coward when they are low on health - In arena just sit still when attacking someone Then the gameplay: - Just the same thing over and over - you don't have a large of things to do - If you press FIRE, FORWARD and LEFT at the same time your car doesn't turn left VERDICT: Don't buy
4794	0	a	Nothing special.
4795	0	a	Literally ♥♥♥♥ do not waste your money.
4796	0	a	Steering is horrible. Graphics are horrible. At least i got it on sale.
4797	0	a	Another game where you oversteer and lose all the time. There's no reason to make an arcade driving game next to unplayable except to hide the fact that the gameplay actually is shallow and routine.   
4798	0	a	This is quite possibly the worst multiplayer interface i've ever had to deal with, it's basically based on the minecraft system, and acts as seperate part of the game, so you can't make a server and play on it with friends unless you have two computers with each having a copy, absolutely terrrible!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4799	0	a	I have pro PC and is go lag
4800	0	a	I bought the game on Dec 20 for 38.69$ and now on Dec 21 the game is 7.73$  Steam doesnt want to refund me because I ''played'' 12h (game opened afk)
4801	0	a	very much lag i cant play the game
4802	0	a	It's ok... but the question of why is the republican party so prominent in the USA? Can't be that many people that benefit from 'the tax cuts' because most americans are broke as ♥♥♥! HA! (c is omitted because murican society seems to enjoy their panties in a bunch up the cavity) Poverty breeds poverty in that female dog! LAWLZ
4803	0	a	a buggy, poorly optimized mess of a racer with dlc that splits the already small multiplayer community
4804	0	a	Just don't buy it. It isn't similar to Twisted metal, its a crap not worth a penny. Co-op is a tragedy.
4805	0	a	While I had high hopes for this game, and it IS a pretty solid racer in its own right, but the multiplayer is a joke (multiplayer being the main reason to pick this up).  1. There is no peer/client listen server option. The only way to play a private match with your friends is to run your own dedicated server. Yes, the devs believe it's 1998.  2. The peak number of players in the WORLD at one time is 200-ish people, right after the Steam Xmas sale. This will drop back down to a dozen on a busy day in a week.  3. Even if you want to bother setting up a server, opening up ports, and MANUALLY GIVING YOUR FRIENDS THE IP TO CONNECT TO (that's right, it's a quakeserver!), there's no steamworks integration. Seriously.  It's like the devs decided they wanted to make a game with zero future.  If you can get this for $2, it's worth it for the singleplayer, but not much more than that, as by the time you can pick it up at that price, there will be no one in the world playing (that's 2 weeks from now btw), but maybe you can sucker a few of your friends to pick it up and you can pretend it's the 90s again and feel the nostalgia of setting up and running an external dedicated server that you give the IP to your buddies to play for 15 minutes and then never play again.  Pretty sure we'll never see another game from this developer. That's a good thing. 
4806	0	a	'Not recommended' with caveats.  It's fun. The driving mechanics feel good. There's a lot of grind to get to the better, faster cars. You'll need to win a lot of races to unlock them slowly, one at a time. The punny humor (racer names like 'Jack Kass', 'Alotta Fagina') wasn't my thing, but it doesn't ruin the game. The announcer, in particular, sticks to the essential information. Things you actually want to hear. God knows how many racing games have been made less pleasurable experieces thanks to blathering announcers.  But bear in mind that Burnout Paradise is $20, and the first GRID is $15 these days. Compared to the $25 price tag here I'd say you're getting a lot more content with either of those games. But, there are guns here, unlike either of those two, and that adds a Mario Kart-like dynamic which can dramatically affect how racers will place or if they'll finish the race at all. If you love racing games and want to pick up another for something new, Gas Guzzlers isn't a bad choice. Look for a sale price or find it in a bundle.

4810	0	a	I would'nt have complain for a 10$ game but seriously a game that crash every now en then in the menu after a race...Over that, there's not much to do. After 3 hours, i'm bored. And dont buy it for the multiplayer option, the server are often empty.
4811	0	a	This is just Mario Kart plus Death Race 2000 with all the interesting parts filed off.
4812	0	a	not very good. races are extremely monotonous, you will be using only few weapons, and unlocking new cars/races can be quite confusing. with big sale you may buy it, but for full price? no way
4813	0	a	I didn't like it, but the game was not bad. And the devs listen to the players, and that is cool.
4814	0	a	This game sucks i dunno who is out there reccomending it to ppl.   The AI is dumb. the customization is pointless. I bought the zombie vr, never saw any zombz. Theyre only seemed to be 3 typesof modes and they didnt matter cause either it was racing (sucha joke agaisnt AI) deathmatch (suffers from the DOOM problem of one weapon too OP makes everything boring) n i dunno just save yourself the money.   If your looking for a coop racing game like mario kart on steam id go with sonic all stars and if your going for like a twisted metal type game, this aint it.
4815	0	a	actually thats a bad copy of the game BLUR True value of the game is 2.99$ 4/10
4816	0	a	graphics are ♥♥♥♥ so ya
4817	0	a	The videos, screenshots and reviews painted an entirely different picture from what we discovered in this game.  Good ideas, but it feels very negleted to the point where we only saw a total of 3 players online, it felt more like a mini game from UDK or similar, not a full production.  Pros  - Nice graphics - Nice design idea - Quirkly, off the wall   Cons  - A total of 3 people showed online - should have raised suspicions then! - Cannot fire with mouse, ENTIRELY reliant on keyboard controls - Boring gameplay - no real sense of satisfaction in weapons - Repetative after 2 races  Luckily it was on sale but IMO not even worth £6
4818	0	a	Not particularly enjoyable. Poor controls
4819	0	a	this game is crap far to slow coudent get even racing hopless game i will never play this game again
4820	0	a	playing the first race, was awesome, not perfect drving but, slick graphics and engaging battles during a race.   but then  I get done with the first race and I have to drive a slow, mini cooper look a like or a 3 wheeled car??   this is such a slap in the face to racing lovers, hate it when games do this waste of time, very low level crap.
4821	0	a	the game sucks so hard
4822	0	a	Unoptimized to the point of being unplayable. Stick with Blur, or maybe Wipeout; they're much classier games, anyway.
4823	0	a	car is all over the place and the ai dont now what the hell they are doing
4824	0	a	This game compare to 'Wreckfest' or other racing types, this one has low quality graphics, small rate of cars, and a bit ♥♥♥♥♥♥ gameplay to beggin with! Sure, it takes back the time in 2012th, when the Beta version came out, but the point is, that this game is weak with short story line in it. Just *bleh* xq
4825	0	a	A waste of money and time!!
4826	0	a	Gets boring and repetitive very rapidly.
4827	0	a	not as dank as i wanted it to be
4828	0	a	Avoid. Simply broken, no idea whether the game would be any good after all: it won't load.
4829	0	a	the came sounds and looks awsome but can i please get my money back my computer doesnt quite run it the way i thought it would. sorry for being a hassel but i would gratelly appriciate getting a full refund.
4830	0	a	new patch full bulshit now game is ♥♥♥♥
4831	0	a	I dont know why i have spent 19.99€ for this game.
4832	0	a	Jolly multiplayer, functional bots, and there's ye olde standard SP thing too. The SP races have great names.  You can choose between racing, full on deathmatch, a variety of modes blending those, customise how much rubberbanding there is, and so on.   Some rough edges and some rather curious dev stances ('you want to disable permanent voice broadcasting? pull our your microphone or disable it for all Steam games, easily fixed!') though. It's not unknown that criticism is met with thread deletion, especially in cases where a dev is called out on any of the frequent questionable statements.  This was a 'Yes' review before I noticed the disappearing threads.
4833	0	a	I've taken 2 years to finally write a proper review of Assetto Corsa, to try to like it and write a positive review. But I've been let down, so there goes a thumbs-down review.  Assetto Corsa came out almost 3 years ago as an Early Access release for a reasonable price taking into account the amount of bugs, lack of content and everything that an uncompleted game brings. The title got a quick nice response from users for its remarkably detailed physics and the absolutely superb work on cars and tracks modelling, being the tracks laser-scanned. Another positive point well welcomed by the community is the full mod compatibility, which extends the possibilities of the game in terms of content and personalisation to amazement.  Kunos though are a very small developing team which has worked so hard to release new tracks and circuits, all of them officially licensed by brands, and refined the game architecture to add capabilities, fix bugs and improve and optimize graphics and performance. All this work is released slowly, drop by drop, long time between, but at least they release it. This year though they decided to get the game out of Early Access, and with a nice full-price tag of double the initial price. The game itself works smoothly, quite well optimised (don't trust the minimum GTX460 required, you can run it with a GT540 easily) and with full compatibility with any wheel or pad. Where's the problem then?  As said before, the amount of content is alarmingly low. After some years the number of cars and tracks hasn't increased much and the variety isn't quite wide really. You have the full Lotus catalogue and most Ferraris, and then a few other cars like a McLaren MP4/12C and its GT3 version and some other road cars. Don't misunderstand me, having such fleet of Ferraris and some of the fasterst road cars is rather coool. But the problem is that they end up being all the same. All the Lotus cars are similar, Lotus cars are similar to some other featured cars, Ferraris are similar to the other high performance cars... After all, you have an acceptable amount of models, but you can summarise them in a few. There isn't a car that outstands among the others, or different types of cars like go-karts or more motorsport disciplines. In fact, you can differentiate 4 categories: F1 cars, Supersports cars, Sportscars and Abarth. I've driven every single car released and it's like that.  Despite that, with the first non-beta release a DLC came out, which adds the Nordschleife and ten cars, which again you can summarise in 4 new real additions. And for a price of 14,99€, right after having paid 49.99€ for a game that seriously lacks content. Unreasonable.   The game is limited to hotlapping. AI is just unraceable because it will just stick to the racing line. Make a move and they'll bump into you as if your car wasn't there. Rival cars will never make a mistake nor get corner-cutting penalties, which you get every time you put a single wheel outside the tarmac and that slows you down to 50kph.  Practice and Hotlap sessions are fun though, they feel as if you were actually there driving on a client run. The entire circuit for yourself, just you and your car. Actually it's fun, especially using a wheel. It ends up challenging yourself to beat your lap time, but after some laps it gets boring... Although it's been announced as out of Early Access, the game itself proves it is just the same as before. Only fully playable mode is hotlapping and you can only play on dry track and not at night. The fun part of this game is pushing against the clock to beat your lap times, but if you can only race in the same weather and light conditions the challenging aspect of the game is lost as soon as you have lapped a few times every circuit.  Online was released in mid Early Access and it was reasonable and justified that it didn't work at all. Later updates made it more stable and raceable, but nowhere near from easy to use. It worked with a 'booking' system. There's a server list with the race info (players, ping, track and cars allowed). Those which are post/pre-race are open for around 5 minutes for people to join by 'booking' an entry on the race. There's not even a matchmaking room, you just click the 'booking' button and wait 5 minutes to play, although most times when the countdown ended the server would just crash and force you to book again. If you manage to enter a race room, it is most of the times empty. Bad part of this is that despite being claimed '1.0 version, full release' the multiplayer keeps just the same.  Mods are more or less easy to find. There are portals and forums which have the Mods and Download sections and uploaders generally have a decent knowledge on the matter, so their work is usually nice although don't expect to find everything you're looking for because most of the mods get banned for copyright and licensing. The game though isn't very respectful with mods. After an update you may find that none of the mods you downloaded are compatible, and as they're mods they don't auto-update. Annoying stuff if you have a large collection of mods.  In the technical aspect, Assetto Corsa is close to brilliant. It may not have rainy weather, or night racing, or a proper damage system, or headlights that actually work or breathtaking graphics effects, but the attention to physics has no rival. Aero effects, weight balance, force feedback... Absolutely amazing. If we take a look at updates changelogs, most of the updates have to do with these things. Handling then will be completely realistic, tricky as it should be. It is not at all playable with gamepad though, but this game is a simulator so it's rather 'dumb' to play with anything different from a wheel, which works perfectly once set up.   The base is solid and really promising, but the lack of content is a fact to consider. Not only that, the gameplay is limited and lacks basic functions. I don't want to compare this game with another one because it's not fair and every game is different on it's own, but Assetto Corsa isn't the best option for a race simulator right now. I'd say it's better to wait until more content is released, but I've done that for a long time and it's becoming hopeless. It's not fair to double the price of the game when it has almost the same things that you had when it was Early Access. Not to mention the DLC...  *PATCH EDIT*  2 more DLC...  4.5/10
4834	0	a	So finally this game came out of early access and is finished and there can't be any excuses anymore. The game didn't changed much. Kunos simulazioni are still really bad at communicating and are very arrogant banning you if you criticize the game or ask something. I'm not talking about childish comments like 'your game sucks'.  The game has a big potential. The physics are good. It has great force feedback. You feel the car, you feel almost everything through the wheel, the driving feel is really good.  Developers keep adding new cars and the game gets better and better in this department, but still i want to see subaru, nissan, ford, audi, peugeut, opel and many more. It‘s a racing game so we need more cars. Of course i don‘t want fake 1000+ cars like in GT series, where you get the same 50 cars in different colors which counts as different cars. But i think ~100 different cars is a must and it's going the right way. Yes there're mods, but i want professionally created cars/tracks, not by some amateurs. There's no auto updates for the mods, so if you have like 50 of them you must update them manually every time. And some mods for this game cost money. I don't approve such behavior and will not support it.  The track selection is not very good at the moment. Still there‘s no famous nurgburgring, but it is annouced as DLC. It‘s not like i‘m against DLC, but i think such track must be included in the game from the start. Especially seeing how good the game sells they should have the budget now. I think Kunos did not expect such luck. It would be cool to have some fictional tracks as well.  AI. It's bad. AI is not aware of you, they just trying to drive trough you. So racing against AI is not very fun. At least they've sorted the difficulty so it's possible to beat AI now even if you make mistakes. Penalty system is absurd. It punishes you every time you go out of track, no matter if you cut the track or slide off the track. Where's the logic behind this? I'm already punished myself by going off the track and lost time and stupid system makes me go on 50kmh for 5 seconds and lose more time.  There‘re challenges too, but they‘re so hard that there‘s no fun playing them, it feels more like a hard work than playing a game so all the challenges are pointless. The best times should be achievable to all players (after some practice of course), even for those which are playing with keyboard/mouse or with a controller, not only for aliens. Online leaderboards should be the place where aliens rule. Oh and forget the game if you're playing with a controller. This game must be played with wheel only. If you're looking for something similar to forza or GT, know that this game is nothing like this.  Multiplayer. It's a joke. MP is boring and pointless. There's no leaderboards or player profiles, no statistics. Most of the time there're too little servers, you just can't find a game. You can join the league, but it's not fun for a casual player to compete with pros. After releasing the full game only tools for kicking people were added. Of course now every mod can ban/kick whoever he wants or dislikes without any reason.  Community is one of the worst. AC fanboys are the worst, you can't say anything bad about AC or criticize it. The game is perfect for them.  What year is it? Almost 2015! And there's still no night racing and no weather conditions. Even GT5 has this and it's some old game made for an old console.  Graphics. The cars looks really great, but everything else is just bad. Like from 2006 but enhanced with hdr and bloom.  No leaderboards. It is really fun in raceroom experience to see the times from all over the world, find your country and try to beat the time.  There are few game modes.  Career which consists of races and time attacks, It will take some time for you to complete it and you'll try the cars. Time attack. It's some broken game mode which makes you go slower. The slower you go in the first couple of laps the more points you get. Drift and drag racing which i'm not interested in so i can't say anything about them.  Another small annoying things: When in photo mode you can't hide the racing line.  Mouse pointer do not disappear while playing.  Can't pause the game and check apps. Racing line is completely broken.  You can have some fun in career mode and in MP with friends, but besides that i can't see how this game could be fun for a non hardcore sim fan. I'm still trying to like this game. It has some really attractive things and hope Kunos will improve the experience for non hardcore sim fans.   Pros:   Great physics Good graphics Good performance Setup sharing   Cons:]   Lack of tracks Lack of cars No workshop support No leaderboards Shallow career mode Challenges are impossible for a normal human
4835	0	a	Solid game but in dire need of more content and better fleshed out multiplayer. Still gets a thumbs up.  EDIT  After a long time I feel the need to edit this review. The price it is going for right now which is about €45 is NOT WORTH IT.  No nighttime Nurburgring is in a DLC pack Barely any car brands to choose from.
4836	0	a	Here we go with the dam DLC. I bought this game when it was still brand new, beta (Early access). now after waiting for MONTHS finally some good cars, updates and tracks come and I have to pay again? that's total BS. so sick of buying games, and then having to buy more stuff to get the full experience. sigh, what a complete fail. I will not buy your DLC. I'll wait for Project cars, thanks.
4837	0	a	Bought this game 7 months ago, physics are great and its a fun hot lap simulator. However its far from finished and Bringing out DLC for 15$ for a few cars is ridiculous when the base game barely has any cars to begin with.
4838	0	a	It's an excellent hot lap simulator. Unfortunately that's all it is. And It's not worth 60 dollars.  Kunos continues to be opaque with development, and throw tantrums during any criticism on the forums, banning people that complain. I'll sum it up.  Online: Netcode is garbage. It's extremely difficult to join a race. Server browser sucks and doesn't have enough options. It's not as though that matters, because there's nobody playing.  Single Play:  The AI is nonexistent, so racing offline is a no. They simply don't recognize the fact that you're there. Smashing in to you in an attempt to stick their pre programmed lines. The penalty system is absurd. Two tires off the track and you'll have your speed cut. Get rammed by the braindead AI? Speed cut. Forced to swerve and cut a corner because the AI doesn't acknowledge you as 'there'. Speed cut. The Career mode is a joke. It never feels like you're doing anything or progressing in anything.  There's a time attack mode that is...odd. And pointless, since there's no leaderboards.  Simulation: ALMOST peerless. Everything feels super tight and realistic. The only thing that's lacking is the sound design and force feedback. The forcefeedback is absurdly high by default. You can fine tune this pretty easily, it just takes time. But the game doesn't seem to want to save my settings. I come back to the game to find my degrees of rotation back to a full 900 despite what I have set up in the in game profiler, and the stand alone one I have.  The UI: Terrible. Everything feels extremely wonky. Once you have everything set up and are ready to drive. I'd say race but again, its a hot lap simulator, it opens it in a SEPARATE INSTANCE. Which makes streaming a nightmare.   Even out of early access, and being out for a full year it's worth 30 dollars at best. There's not enough tracks, and not enough cars. There was dlc announced before the game was even released.  The cars themselves look superb, but everything else looks last gen at best, ps2 era at theworst. This is mostly a problem with usermade tracks so its excuseable.   Because the PC is starved for sims that have the latest roster of cars, this game is basically a must play. But buy it on sale. It's not worth full price. It wasn't when it was in EA, and it's not worth it now. I wouldn't spend more than 20 dollars on it. Almost every aspect of the game besides the driving feels incomplete or lazy.  Edit December 2016, hope you like DLC.
4839	0	a	This game does an excellent job as a racing/driving simulator. The physics are good, the cars are fun to drive, and its overall very realistic. The reason I recommend you not to buy this is because of it's lack of content. A lot of the cars feel the same. There is very little difference between each car, and there are not even that many cars to select from. The track selection is also mediocre.   The real fault in this game is the lack of good multiplayer support. The multiplayer in this game is just a series of community servers. Its very hard to find a server hosting a legit race. If the game ever introduces a matchmaking-type multiplayer, then this game would definitely be a must-buy. But as of now, the multiplayer sucks. You run out of contect quickly with singleplayer, and after about 10-15 hours you lose your drive(haha) to play the game.  Overall, the game does an amazing job at capturing real driving, and makes it super fun to drive the cars. This being said, there is very little content, and will bore you very quickly. Not worth at full price, maybe worth at half price if you REALLY want to drive some realistic cars.
4840	0	a	Great for hotlaping. Iconic cars. Great Force Feed Back and car handeling. Laser scanned tracks. Modable.   Terrible Ai and bare-bones multiplayer.
4841	0	a	TL;DR: The following review is inaccurate (because it is now a year old) and although the game has goen through huge improvements on the points criticised and other things, I still do not recommend this hotlap-simulator.  Update: a year after, it seems like the netcode and AI have been updated and make the game become playable with other cars on the track. They added 4WD support and a few free cars next to the DLCs to show off this new feature of the physics engine. DLC #3 has been released, with some Lamborghinis, nice to see them deliver that promise. One of the Lambos in the game however is community content that has been promoted to be part of the official game (if I remeber correctly). All in all, if you are searching for some fun driving cars around track with great realism and don't care for AI or online multiplayer, you might want to try the game. Beware though, it is a simulator, so it is best played using a steering wheel, preferably a 900degree, so you can use the full lock of the cars.   With the announcements of the Dream Pack #1 DLC I felt like I needed to warn potential buyers of this game. So here it goes: After having pre-purchased this game and having early-access being able to play the beta, it was a pretty good experience, the physics are okay most of the time and feel incredibly good with lower power rear wheel drive vehicles (eg: BMW M3 E30, BMW M3 E92, BMW Z4 E89, BMW 1 Series M Coupe, KTM Xbow, Lotus Evora SR, Lotus Elise SC) The front wheel drive cars do not feel that great to me, but as I am not a fan of these I will pass the subject. Now for the gameplay aspect: Menus are reasonably well designed and constructed, the options menus is very big with a lot of options (very nice to see). Just a little side note, menus are a seperate process from the game engine so you can let your PC cool down a bit between two races which is a nice segue to bring you to the graphics engine part of the game... Graphics, well oh boy... The optimisation... the obvious lack of thereof... The graphics look good but it's nothing extremely spectacular and yet I struggle to max out the settings and get a decent framerate (my system: 2-way SLI of GTX 680s, an i7 4770k @4GHz and 16GB of RAM) The in-game UI is very minimal and is not very well optimised for the multiplayer aspect of racing in my honest opinion, but Kunos has THE answer, modding... Yes, like the rest of the game, you can mod, and the UI is coded in Pyhton so you can either make your own or download one from someone else. I will not comment on multiplayer as my experience was sub-par to all the other simulations I've played but it was about 8-9 months ago so it might have changed. The AI is horrible absolutely not aware of you the race on rails they are not braking when you are and thus bump into you and thow you off track, the difficulty of the AI is also something strange... You, well I at least, can't keep up with the race leader, if you don't overtake the AI in the first 3 to 4 corners well the cars in front of you are going to vanish into the distance and you'll never catch up, interrestingly, if you turn the scenario the other way around, if you are the race leader, even if you don't drive that well and don't set lap records they'll never catch up (assuming you don't crash of course). So finally Assetto Corsa becomes a solo player hotlap simulator with... not a lot of content. 37 cars of which probably half are just variants of the same car 10 tracks where 3 of them have a second shorter variant A drag strip for quarter and full mile A dedicated drifting playground 'track'  But this not a lot of content part will change in the same horrible fashion that game developpement has seen fit to go towards... Yes you guessed it, they have at least 1 DLC planned.  Regarding the controls also very important to note, if you do not have a steering wheel... well do not try the keyboard and the controllers are a nightmare to use and to make it worse... You have to have a 900 degres steering wheel because the game supports it but also likes to map the 900 degres of rotation to a 270 degre steering wheel making the force feedback way too powerful and the steering way too sensitive and imprecise.  Also apparently 45EUR (or your regional equivalent) is not enough... they want to add content but also fill their pockets because yes game devs also want to live they do not work for free, they are planning to release a DLC in the coming weeks... months...? but thanks to its naming scheme we know that it is far from the only DLC that is planned... What the F is wrong with game devs nowadays? Why DLC? Whay not wait to release the game for full price when the game is ready and finished, when there is content that make the game worth buying?  At this point I don't know what I should do with it other than poke it with a really really long stick to see when new content is going to be added, and see how much the DLC will cost... As I generally do with any game that does include DLC in its roadmap... look at blizzard people please, they have a roadmap that says: 1-dev 2-bugfix 3-release 4-make sure everything is stable 5-dev DLC* 6-Bugfix DLC* 7-release DLC* (8-repeat steps 4 to 7)  * In Blizzard terms, DLC means expansion that is downloadable, your game does not tell you all the time 'this content is part of a DLC to unlock it buy the DLC', no instead it doesn't show anything of it in-game, it does show however a nice thing on the  Battle.net  Launcher saying that there is an upgrade available for this game. A Blizzard expansion is typically more expansive than a DLC and for a good reason, it add a butt-ton of content and updates and patches and additional balancing and new awesome Pixar-like quality animations for cutscenes... PLEASE EVERYONE STOP BUYING DLC...  And here isa little bonus (yay more text). It's the comment I left on the Assetto Corsa facebook page regarding the announcement of the Dream Pack #1 DLC: Not long ago they made something 'very fun and appropriate'. They released a video teaser of the contract deal they signed with Lamborghini in which they show 4 different cars that are not part of the game, and obviously advertises the game as having these cars in it when obviously no one has seen them in game... They're part of the upcomming DLC (not the lambos, these are clearly coming later)  The modding aspect is great, allowing and encouraging modding is great. But making an engine adding 10-15 cars plus a racing variant of some of these cars and another engine another racing class (essantially the same model but with 300 HP instead of 350 and weighing 1100kg instead of 1250kg doesn't make it that different), 10 tracks and asking the community for their money and hard-work to make the game worth a damn by making mods, and asking to please not upload poor quality mods because it's an elite game, we want to have good content... (The please do not port is a genuine thing on the modding part of the assetto corsa forum, feel free to go and check it ot yourself)  I am not happy about the money I spent on the game, it was too much for the content provided... I would prefer for them to remove their branding for the game, because frankly 'Your racing simulator'... Well it bloody hell isn't mine...  Thanks for making it this far :)
4842	0	a	This game refuses to let me play a race, and the developer refuses to offer any support. Whenever I start a game it asks me to install Steam, which is rather odd because I launched the game from Steam. If I click install, it makes me quit Steam which makes me quit Assetto Corsa, and it reinstalls Steam; but will do the same thing if I try to start another race. If I click cancel and dont install Steam, it just takes me back to the main menu in Assetto Corsa.  I emailed the developer about this, and their response was to post my question to their forum, and hope that another person who paid money for this game will tell me why this game refuses to acknowledge I have Steam installed. I sent a response saying this was unacceptable, and the developer refuses to respond to that. Are you serious? You're charging $50 for a game, you refuse to fix bugs which are worse than game breaking (i can't even start a game for it to break), and you refuse to offer any support at all. Dont waste your money on this, the developer has essentially abandoned the product, and is simply defrauding Steam users purporting that this game works and is actively supported.
4843	0	a	Assetto Corsa is a half finished game and I cannot recommend it. AC works fine as a hotlapping sim. You'll ohh and ahh at the graphics but that's largely all there is here. For something to be called 'your racing simulator', there actually has to be racing involved. It should be called 'Your Hotlapping Simulator'.  - No Single Player Pit stops - No Rolling starts - No weather - No Night racing -The Single player portion is largely worthless. The AI is not worth running against. They run off track, run over each other, and run into the back and sides of the player.  -Each time Kunos 'improves' their game, it breaks some other part (sound for modded cars, graphics, etc - The force feedback is far over exxagerated - The tire model is laughable compared to other sims and thus the reason it is changed with each patch. - you'll cringe at the CPU Occupancy errors stating your CPU is at 99 percent when while running a CPU monitor, it shows 60 percent usage -If you have Windows 10, forget about running this sim. Devs on the official forums response is to reinstall windows or DDU your graphics drivers (in other words, they can't fix it).  Wretched game In my opinion. Had the refund option been in place when I purchased it, this turd would have gone back to Kunos.
4844	0	a	Although very well done as a simulator, Assetto Corsa still lacks content and features that it should have had long before they even thought about releasing a dlc. For me to come back to this game 6 months after purchasing to find it in almost the same state I left it with the only difference being half the cars required me to buy a dlc to use was aggravating to say the least.
4845	0	a	As a simulator this game is absolutely incredible. The physics are a bit unforgiving if you drive beyond your limits, as it should be. Furthermore, the graphics look wonderful (Use the Glide filter to prevent brightness adjustment, by the way) and the selection of cars both mod and official are pretty decent.  As a racing game in today's market, it's not that great. Single-player AI is pants-on-head stupid, the track selection is incredibly small, and multiplayer is almost entirely unplayable at 200+ ping. Official leagues don't exist, public lobbies are filled with idiots, and you'll rarely ever find a good room of people using any of the more interesting disciplines, like the Lotus Eleven.  If you are a racing simulation enthusiast, this is a decent choice for you. I love driving the Mercedes 190E DTM around the Nordschleife, right where it belongs. The tracks are all very well done, and some of the mod tracks and cars are unbelievably fun and/or to AC's laser-scanned standards. Lake Louise is a fun loop around the Canadian Rockies, and Bridgehampton is just as bumpy as you'd expect a race track situated in Long Island to be. You can drive a Supercharged Cobra 427, but you can grab the mod with the Competition and Street versions as well. There's also a very good NA Miata mod.  If you are anything but an enthusiast, maybe hold off until there is a bigger selection of cars and tracks, or find a different sim to play. I can't recommend this game because SPR is almost broken and MPR is unplayable, if not frustrating.
4846	0	a	EDIT: Ok, so i have lightened up a little since last time. Since the 1.5 update i have been playing it sporadic, with so much love that i almost cant explain it. But it still misses out on rain wich i think it's a disgrace to the Ayrton Senna legacy, if they continue to let it out. Monaco too.... So my thumb stays down until further notice. No rain no gain.    'The waaaiting is the hardest part' Tom Petty once sang. I think it describes this sim perfectly since there are lots of promises but no will of doing them justice. Green hell with DLC cars was kinda expected september this year but we still havent seen it. It's a good racing game but the waiting is the hardest part as said before. I will certainly never buy an early access game ever again.
4847	0	a	So as far as realism goes, Very good. Looks over all, Very good. Online mutiplayer, garbage. Carreer mode, meh at best.   PROS: Looks very nice while playing. The driving aspect is good through controller and a wheel is best! (DUH) Tracks are fun, and the variety of cars is great.  CONS: I started out with Career mode. Let me tell ya. Borin as hell. No realistic feel what so ever. They are dumb AI. Single line race and easy to predict. Easy to get first place. Dont even have to finish the race. Get in first place and just stop in front of the other cars and watch them retire. Then you can retire and walla.  Mutiplayer: (sigh) This is where it all goes wrong! I was hoping for a very fast pace join in and race game. This is not it. Join in and watch peeps screw off is more like it. Trying to get the feel for the track/qualifying is a problem simply due to the other people. There are always people crashing into you for fun. Starting a race can take up to 20 mins before any magic starts to happen, and when it finally does start, you got those peeps that are not serious and want to crash. I thought thats what GTA is for. Over all It doesnt take long before I sign into a another game and have a dissapointed view of this game.   THE FIX: Dont play this game, Play a different one. (For me at least). My friend who convinced me to get this game say's otherwise.
4848	0	a	 Early Access Review
4849	0	a	I have change my mind about this game for several reasons. This game is NOT complete, if you have brought it wanting and expecting a £35.00 (At the time of writing) game, then you are going to be dissapointed. Don't let them fool you this IS still in early acsess. A list of things that are broken:  Most conserningly for a 'complete' game, the A.I is the worst I have seen in a racing game in along time. They do not know where you are on the track, and will in effect ram you off the road by overtaking in the worst points. This also means that the career is only possible if you are on easy and some kind of God. Also it makes any race very annoying. I may not be the greatest driver, but getting more than third in most races in impossible.  The down-shifting is broken. It will wait untill the car is at 3000 RPM untill it changes down.  You need a wheel, otherwise it is unplayable, meaning it in NOT a relaxing game to sit down and play.  There are some, good things, one major thing is that the handling physics ARE good, but you will only get 20 hours gameplay max from hot-lapping.  My outcome is that this game is to damn expencive.  (P.S I do relise that the dev's put alot of hard word into this game, and I think that this game, whilst in my OPINION is not the greatest at the moment this COULD be an exquisit game. It just not worth £35.00 yet. I will continue following this game and I will change this Review when the next big update comes out)  Also my wheel's rotation sensor is broken, but this is the ONLY game in my Steam game list that does not fix this temporarly, meaning on this game, 90% of the time I have to go through long lists to get force feedback working properly, taking sometimes upto 30 mins to fix this, EVEN GTA 5 DOES THIS!
4850	0	a	I love this game. I really do. But I can not recommend this game at all. I bought this game when it was in early access for about $35.00. I have watched this game grow into what it is today and now you can just see greed taking over the developers, I have spent 120+ hours waiting for new cars with every update but now they have DLC. It would be even worse for the people who bought this game now for $55.00. So on top of the original price tag of $55.00 people still need to pay $17.00 for the dream pack. What an utter display of corporate greed.   (They also say that it is their first dream pack that came out and implying that there are going to be more. I'm sorry but no. I just can't recommend it.)
4851	0	a	After years since early access even if is has been launched the game still feels incomplete, the game engine is good but lacks more cars variety and race-tracks, single player experience is minimal, the AI is Broken, and with all this DLC garbage it is just the opposite as i was expecting for a racing sim game, not worthy for the price. and after the latest updates they just broke the game for me and now it doesn't even start anymore.
4852	0	a	I'm not sure why I bought this game... maybe it was that little shinning hope that when it does come out of early access it would be a brand new amazing game. Every time I play this game I remind myself how bare bones and awful it is. I honestly don't know why the community holds this game up in such high regards.  Not all is bad I mean there's plenty of things to like the number one thing being the physics model it's fun amazing and engaging. There tonnes of graphics and user options to mess around with which is great, there's also plenty of support for controllers and wheels. There's a decent single player campaign and a fun multiplayer but that's as far as it goes for me when it comes to the good stuff.  Now the bad considering I paid around $40 back when it was in early access and it now has only like 16 tracks and about 40-50 cars... an embarrassing line up of cars at that too, not to mention half the cars are just the same damn ♥♥♥♥ anyways and the rest of the good stuff is behind paid DLC. The menus are clunky and more often than not you run into bugs. There is still only 3 good modes more like 2 good modes hot lap, time attack and *cough* 'shitdriftmode' *cough* and to top it off this game doesn't even try to add Steam Workshop considering its only saving grace is ♥♥♥♥ing mods.  I'm honestly shocked how people actually want this... is this what the community wants? Just a nice physics driven game with a huge lack of content? I'm honestly ashamed to even own this game, if the only thing this game has going for it is the physics than I rather look elsewhere for a game with actual content.
4853	0	a	I really want to like this game, great driving, good mod support, good graphics, just lots of good. But the game is yet to feel finished, they realised the first DLC recently, and I was thinking to myself, 'what? That's absurd! You can't release DLC for an Early Access game!' So I went to the store page and found that the game wasn't in Early Access anymore.  And this is the meat of my issues with this game, it's contentless. There's a miniscule number of cars, and a tiny number of tracks, and this would be ok, if the game was $30 dollars, but it's $50, almost full price, yet, there isn't enough to warrant the price.  I feel jipped when I play this game, yeah, there are mods, but when a game's best feature is something someone else has done, then there is a problem.  This asking price is also annoying for those of us (like myself) who have a limited budget, when I first purchased this game for $30 dollars, I felt a little ripped off, but I thought to myself, 'don't worry, they'll add more content.' Yet they haven't, and I still feel like I've been had. Despite me paying almost half then the current asking price, I still don't feel like I've got a good deal. If I'd purchased this game for $50, I'd probably be ripping my hair out currently.   Yes, this game has a lot of good points, but due to the fact that there is a laughably low amount of content in this game, I simply can't recommend this game to anyone who has respect for their money. If you have money coming out of your eye balls, then go ahead, buy it, enjoy a very good simulation of driving, but if you don't, then move on, because this is simply a waste. 
4854	0	a	Before you read the rest of my review please understand i would love to give this a recommendation but at the current time just dont feel i can.  Since i purchased this in the early access stage i have tried repeatedly to enjoy this game, yes i believe there should be some enjoyment in playing a simulation and not just tedium. Unfortunately i cant recommend this game except to the most hardened driving simulation fans and even they will suffer at some point from the absolute perfect driving of the A I . This isnt even mentioning when the AI wish to pass you on a corner etc the answer seems to be quite simple - rear end you , this leaves you ( not them at any point i noticed ) careening onto the grass / track edge for a penalty or slow down to 50kmh ( something you would expect to find in an arcade game with catch up enabled! .  Unfortunately this games just feels like an exercise in stress. I will commend the team for improving the overall driving experience since the early access but the A I simply hasnt been well adjusted.   Another unusual presence in this game is the career mode choices , a time trial just for 'the fun of it' seems to be thrown into career mode, whilst i can understand this gives you chance to practice the track before engaging in a race so does practice ( thats kind of what its there for ) .  I think ultimately the developers need to understand that whilst there are many hardened sim racers out there who will thoroughly enjoy most of this experience they have ultimately sold themselves short by not creating a particularly enjoyable experience.   If you are willing to invest a lot of time of the steep difficulty curve and love racing sims then get it. If you like racing games in general this probably wont be your cup of tea.
4855	0	a	This game has been great the handful of times I have been able to get the the non-early access version to run. The support forums are dismissive and downright clueless and why on earth does a game need external python to be install outside of Steam (thats the advice I get from their tech support when I post about my issues, they seem to think it is a cure all for all the games issues...)?  Save your money and buy something else!
4856	0	a	Game has a paulty selection of cars and tracks, menus feel undone and most of the game feels half ♥♥♥♥♥. I thought the game was unfinished and so i was withholding my review until the final product but the inclusion of 15$ dlc has me believe otherwise. The nurbergring is paid dlc btw
4857	0	a	Do you enjoy Forza? Looking for something similar, but that you can play on PC? Hoping to use an Xbox 360 controller or something similar because you don't have $300-$1000 of disposable income to buy on a racing wheel? Look elsewhere.   I bought this because I have played all kinds of racing games over the years, but hadn't really found a good PC racing game. This looked like the answer, but after a little over a half an hour of skidding into walls while trying frantically to saw at the wheel in a vain attempt to regain control of my vehicle, I realized that this is not the game for me.  Realistically, in the 'Requirements' section, a racing wheel should be listed. If you're going to say that you support the Xbox 360 controller, then I shouldn't have to futz with the settings just to finally get it to a point where the most minute of movements doesn't have the driver spinning the wheel frantically from side to side. Honestly, this problem has been SOLVED. Turn 10 obviously is aiming almost exclusively for the 360 controller, but these developers basically just shoved in some nonsensical presets and called it a day. It appears to respond as it would to the analog input of a wheel, which is ridiculous. A wheel has wildly different affordances than a 360 controller, yet the default presets make the game unplayable with said controller.  Not to mention the fact that the game crashed multiple times on me in various settings menus. I'm very disappointed with Assetto Corsa. As a racing fan, I was hoping that this would be the answer for my craving for a solid racing game to replace Forza. What I received was a buggy game that only appears to be enjoyable if you've got a racing wheel. Which is fine, but I wish I had known that *before* I dropped $60 on the game. Now, because there is no refund policy for games that you instantly regret buying, I get to look at this game resentfully in my library every time I open Steam.  If you've got a pro racing setup already in your home and you're a racing sim veteran, then this review really isn't for you. However, if you, like I was previously, are looking for something to fill a Forza-sized hole in your PC library, look elsewhere.
4858	0	a	Game is okay - controls and response from my controller seem sluggish and delayed, which makes it hard to play. My biggest complaint? The fact they just released a $15 DLC pack, and the main game itself has such a tiny collection of cars. on top of that, there is no menu music, the buttons don't clearly state what they are so you're kind of left guessing in some parts, and the controller support only works during a race and not for any of the menus! Why would I want to put my controller down and grab my mouse/keyboard for navigating the menu?   In conclusion - game has a lot of potential, but come on AC team. Get your prirorities straight, and deliver us a good complete game before you go fishing for more DLC money...
4859	0	a	I wanted this game to be good. But its just not a good racing game. I hate to say this but simraceway is far better. Simraceway has things I dont like about it, but at least the racing is fun.
4860	0	a	I'd be happy paying a max of 25-30 dollars for this game but no where near what I paid for it.  Pros:  -fast load times make it easier to quit the game -An idea to bring a 'simulation' racer to the PC  Cons:  -Limited cars, can't believe it's been out this long and theres only that many to choose from -Sound effects are great on some cars and absolutly terrible on others -Every windscreen in the game is dirty apparently, funny this because it's based on tarmac, they're all dirty, so enjoy when you're driving towards the sun, over done linear glare that makes it impossible to see anything, this is NOT a simulation feature, this is just poor practice -Lousy textures on scenary, seriously terrible -Game play feels far to linear  It just doesn't feel exciting enough, it feels so boring (Is it lacking atmosphere?) and I'm basing this off the price I paid for it which was $75AUD   I think perhaps if they stick with this and knuckle down it'll be a decent game in a couple years time, however by then we'll have alot more out hopefully, so I'd probably skip on this if you enjoy the forza series and GT series. It's nothing like them, it feels less than one quater of what those games offer.
4861	0	a	Honestly i had so much hope for this Sim... the Problem is that its nothing more than a hot lap sim .... the Career mode sucks, no pit stops, no quali, the damage model is a joke, no night racing, no endurance (nothing more than 30 lap race), NO WEATHER and news that the game is going to be ported to console. The game isn't even ready on PC let alone porting it over to a console. Get a grip Such a shame because as i say it has got a lot of hope going for it. Why on earth they made DLC is madness in my eyes. Also there hasn't been a patch since April.... we are in July now. I pray to god they get there act together. At least the game isn't as bad as Project Cars. Its nowhere near as good as ISI or Reiza Studio games.
4862	0	a	The actual driving of the cars is good, but this is about it. The game is NOT fun at all, and I mean in the sense that everthing is so frustratingly complicated, Menus, Multiplayer, settings etc. Trying to host a server is a pain in the butt you need to have a degree in IT. I have come to the point that I am not playing anymore due to the fact that I cannot have a proper racing session with my friends. Project cars is more simpler, even though not as realistic, but at the end of the day it does not matter.
4863	0	a	Do not buy if you do not have a wheel and pedals.
4864	0	a	I thought it was quite awful, to be honest. Worst 25 bucks I've spent in a long time. It lacks polish and has a cheap feel to it. Buy Dirt Rally or Forza or something. Graphics are meh too, even at ultra. I got this game refunded.
4865	0	a	The controller support was a nightmare, I could not get it working and ended up spending 90 minutes looking it up solutions. I refunded it after that.
4866	0	a	Il explain my experience here. And a few absolutes. After switching on most games you get to play them However that was not thecase with AC. I havent managed to play it yet. The General User Interface (GUI) is in one word... Diabolical. It is set up like a website and not very clear what you have to actually do to get it to work. I set the screen at 800x600 because that is the only way I could get it to display the whole thing. (its usually 1280x900/720).  Then when I get on the actual track its not clear how to get the car to actually move... Then when it eventually does move, its undrivable with massivve oversteer (not very realistic at all). But if that was the only problem I wouldnt have commented here. I would have sorted it but to be frank this game will never get played. The whole experience of it is as mentioned Diabolical.   I like to pick up my controller and press the buttons and play. This requires constant use of a mouse which to me makes it unplayable. If I could get my money back I would. Its terrible. And will never play it.  
4867	0	a	Game is completely lacking in content: few cars and very, very few circuits.  Their idea of a single-player campaign is so half-arsed they needn't have bothered putting it in.  To make things even worse you have to reinstall your video drivers everytime you want to play. Otherwise you load into a black screen.  I can't wait for Project Cars.
4868	0	a	A half finished game that came out of early access a year too soon.
4869	0	a	Update November 2015: ======================= As of the newest version 1.34 the game still has the most annoying flaws I mentioned in my original review. These are jaggy shadows, really bad anti aliasing, moiré effects on the guard-rails, flickering polygon edges, only basic skin variations for some cars and so on. So I still can't recommend the game until you can grap it for 10 bucks.   Original Review: ======================= Missing content that is normally standard for a racing game, incomplete features, bugs and texture as well as shadow flickering are the reasons why prolonged fun is difficult to come by in this game and why I can't recommend it as of now (v1.04). By my mind this game is as of v1.04 in in a beta state and should not have been released like this.  In Detail: I expect from a racing game that advertises fully featured single player modes at least one thing and that is that I will be able to race against AI opponents with a field of at least 20 cars that are of the same racing league and where every single car has its own livery. However, this is as of v1.04 not the case in Assetto Corsa!  Further, some of the skins that come with the game are very basic like the ones for the RUF Porsche or the Fiat 500 Abarth. They do not have any numbers on them or stickers, nothing, just plain single- or bi- colored paintjobs. Makes it difficult to drive in a pack of say 20 and differentiate who is who without turning on hovering driver names over the cars.  Besides those missing basic features this game has other serious problems with flickering shadows and moiré effects on the guard-rails. Unfortunately no configuration settings so far could fix it and the devs do seem to ignore the issue on the official forums so there is no help for it there either. By the way I am playing on a GTX 970.  Other problems are related to performance issues specifically the game displaying a warning about the CPU occupation above 95% but when I check the performance records in the Windows 7 Resource Monitor I can see that my CPU shows just 50% usage. Again no help in the official forums could be found even though several threads for the issue exist.  On top of that a lot of small bugs are very annoying like brake bias that sometimes will not adjust when I press the button for it or the game crashing when I try to assign a function to the ^-key on my keyboard and so on.  So as of now the fun, even so it sometimes is there when the game works for some time as one would expect, goes away very fast because of the small anoyances that in the sum are just to much to keep it going.
4870	0	a	Wow. No music, no controller enabled menus, resets your tv unless you choose an option?  True, its one of the FEW racing sims on PC. Thats all its got going for it. If youve got a Sim setup, great for you, else wait till this drops to 5 bucks. Thats all its worth to anyone else who doesnt drop $1000+ into a sim machine (wheels, chairs, etc.). This is an application - very far from an actual game.  For 50 bucks I'd expect a much more professional approach and appeal.  
4871	0	a	Every time i click on 'drive' the game bothers me with opening his DLC-Site. It totaly deserves a negative assessment just for that f... behaviour.
4872	0	a	The best Racing Sim/Hard+software engineer RPG ever made.  Want to race beautifully rendered high powered cars around outstanding laser scanned tracks from around the world? Hells yeah! Want a really excellent car set-up ability that really feels like it makes a difference? This game really does have all that in spades. Okay the career is a bit boring, but online racing is good. The cars really handle very differently to each other and the laser scanned Nurburging Nordschleife is an absolute joy to drive.  Then a couple of times a year a patch comes along +/- DLC. This is where the game suddenly becomes RPG.   You've proved your metal on the track, you've fine tuned those racing machines to your perfection...now have you got what it takes to do the same to your PC and the software? Before you can get back out on to the track you must cut your way through another field of hopefuls, all floundering in the sand trap cos the FPS drop sent them there, desperately trying to find the fix to get them out of the techno babble hell they've been sent to. My fellow hopeful asked a simple question on a forum (the guy had about as much knowledge as me...not a lot) and got this reply....'26% total core load, yes but what are your individual core loads? You might have one core being hammered to the point that it affects the proceeding cores causing a bottleneck.' FANTASTIC! Possibly the worst good point I ever saw on a gaming forum.   I've been stuck in this RPG phase of the game over a week. Sure I've learnt some stuff about hardware and software, but really I just want to drive a racing car in a video game. I don't want to be going into game files and changing numbers or spending 20hrs in forums after every patch.  If I was to score out of ten, 5 for the drive sim, 0 for the RPG. 5/10.
4873	0	a	instead of fixing multiplayer or single player gameplay (engine sound, physics,model etc.) ,they just keep releasing DLCs  edit:they even copy exact same physics from other cars and put them in recent DLC. Think twice before you purchase.
4874	0	a	I love driving in this game. The physics are difficult but once you get over the learning curve it's very rewarding. The graphics are outstanding, as is the sound. But that's all this game has going for it.  The career mode could not be more dull. It's a very simple, linear game. And since there are hardly any cars or tracks it gets repetitive. There is nothing to work for. No currency to buy cars, no 'tournaments' that you can only enter by meeting certain qualifications, no licences. I'm not even sure why they call it a career mode. The experience of being a carrer racing driver is not there.  Coming from console gaming, and in particular playing the Gran Turismo series, this game is a huge letdown. I am hoping somebody comes out with a decent sim eventually because there's not much to offer on PC right now.
4875	0	a	- good simulator - nice textures, ok shaders - game engine supports 1 light source, which is dumb in 2015, this mean NO SHADOWS, NO REFLECTIONS, NO NIGHT TRACKS, etc.. - lack of CONTENT (car/tracks wise) 
4876	0	a	As a big fan of rF2 i have to say that i dont like AC, the FFB has gotten a lot better than it used to be, but its still bad, the cars physics are, alright but their quality varies widely from car to car. The UI is good and terrible at the same time, not having possibility to do any settings changes without leaving track back to menu is very frustrating. Kunoz now started presenting DLCs for which you need to pay extra, something you will never see at rF2. AC simply does not offer what i am looking for in a simulator, that is the reason why i wouldnt buy it knowing what i know, and definetly not recomend it. There are far better simulators. Sorry
4877	0	a	First of all, i sould say i've never played a Racing Sim. I was hoping for a PC Gran Turismo, but it's a lot more hardcore. I can't seem to even corner properly, i just go straight most of the time. I need more practice :)  Update With a bit more practice right now, i can corner a bit. It doesn't do me much good at the moment, i'm stuck on the second career challege (the Fiat 500 Abarth SS race). Now, here's something i've noticed in most racing games: the fixed pattern your opponents will follow and can't be moved from. I crashed into another car, which left me spinning, but the other car just kept driving in his fixed pattern.  Normally this isn't much of a deal, but here a wrong corner will make you lose the race. Assetto Corsa is that kind of game. One mistake, you lose the race and hit the reset button. Which is what i have been doing for the past hour; hitting the reset button. I'm beginning to fear that this game is not for me.
4878	0	a	This game should still be in early access. Great physics, no content, you get bored after while.  You can have millions of cars and tracks, but that alone is not enough to make full featured game.  This is a missed opportunity for a great racing sim. Hopefully they will make it into a full game one day. I even have Oculus rift and not even that saves this.
4879	0	a	Nordschleife is a DLC? In a racing simulator with so little content? FOR TEN BUCKS? You must be joking. Or insane.
4880	0	a	This is the best damn burnout, crashing and super overpowered unbeatable ai simuator i have ever wasted 50 bucks on. I want my money back. Dont buy it unless you have a 200 dollar steering controler. And a lot of patience. Neither of which i have.
4881	0	a	i think this is ridiculous... not only are the greedy people now charging for dlc packs on an unfinished game but now all modded content is useless... wtf people this is such bull**** its not even funny... i want a refund
4882	0	a	Unless you're a true racing sim fanatic and have a racing set up ie; steering wheel, pedals and all that, I'd avoid this one. I found it pretty boring. The only reason I bought it was because it was on sale (hardly), and I was looking for a good racing game. Unfortunately I didn't find it here.   4/10  Bring Forza to PC Microsoft...
4883	0	a	DOESNT WORK FOR WINDOWS 10 WOULDN'T EVEN LOAD THE GAME AND WHEN I HAD WINDOWS 7 IT GAVE MY PC 40 FPS AND ON PROJECT CARS I GET 100...
4884	0	a	There's nothing particularly wrong with it, but at the same time there's nothing really fun about it either. Assetto Corsa does nothing at all to distance itself from the current crop of racing games. It lacks any sort of spirit or identity, and ends up feeling far too sterile and almost mechanical in nature. There's just not enough here for me to recommend this game.
4885	0	a	can you please fix the start engine button not working. i spent good money on the game and even a car pack and every time i click the button to start a race it just loads for 5 seconds then goes back to the menu
4886	0	a	Great racing simulation but the lack of content and a competent career mode makes this game unreccomendable.
4887	0	a	I was looking for a bit of a change from iRacing, boy are we spoiled over there. This was trerrible.
4888	0	a	Not worth owning unless you have a wheel.
4889	0	a	This is a really good game and probably the best in terms of driving i've played. However the lack of features in this game makes it really hard for me to recommend it, it feels like it is still in beta. However the modding community for this game is spectacular. So If you are ok with loads of modding etc then go for it but personally i was looking for a more complete game which for me this wasn't
4890	0	a	This ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game doesnt even work since the last patch
4891	0	a	Great mechanics, horrible UI and seriously lacking content. Everything is DLC. A racing sim with DLC that is more expensive than the base game.  Nurburgring-Nordshliefe - DLC Brands Hatch - DLC McLaren P1 - DLC GT40 - DLC FXX-K - DLC and so on...  I supported this game back when it was early access because I liked how realistic it was and wanted more cars/tracks. Turns out you get very little without the DLC.
4892	0	a	Worked great for a while, started crashing instead of loading races. Multiple attempts over several months to fix it (repl. drivers, settings, uninstall/re-install, etc.) still won't load a race. Black screen then crashes back to the launcher. It appears the only thing that stands a chance at fixing this god awful product at this point is a full re-install of Windows. I have neither the time nor the inclination to bother with that. Broken game can ♥♥♥♥ right off.
4893	0	a	I really want to like this game for its physics and overall driving experience, that i give 10/10. For the game overall i give a 6/10, as i beleive there isnt a game there. You just drive around tracks with these nice cars, which i give them credit for the cars are done really well. The ai has no character about it at all, they never make mistakes, and when they do its predictable on the same corners, like its programed. The career mode is terrible. Not really any incentive to keep going in career. A career to me is something you can work toward, with proper races, and incentives to win the next race. This career mode basicly gets you to try out all the cars, as you progress through it. This game is a simulator, it definetley simulates a driving expereince, just no game part. If you enjoy just going for a cruise in exotic cars doing hotlaps its awsome. For the game part it gets boring. Multiplayer i have not played, so i dont know and cant comment on this aspect.  There is just no decent depth to the concept of Driving in this simulator (game). For example Dirt Rally, F1, Test drive. Using seasons, having a time concept to the game, getting attached to the competitors, a background to why you are racing, maybe even having a money system in it. To make you earn that exotic car you love. To make a car simulator great its the little things over and over that make something big. In movie terms there are some good actors, and acting in Assetto Corsa, but just no plot. Movies are uninteresting with no plot, as you know, and so can games (simulators) be.  I think mods are good in games, simulators, but when you buy a product you would expect it to be good in its own right, we shouldnt have to rely souly on the mods to make the game good. If the game is good by itself, mods would only enhance the goodness of the game.
4894	0	a	Sadly i love this game... But i can't recommend it to anyone...  The main reasons are as follows.  -Horrible AI (The AI drive like you don't exist... You will get pushed off at every opportunity.. I race mostly offline and when a car is right behind me i can't race the track anymore i just have to push beyond all my braking points just so that i avoid the AI ramming into me or taking an inside turn when one doesn't exist. I don't understand why this is such a problem for assetto when there are games out there that do pretty good with AI i mean.... atleast the AI is aware that you exist... As for AI vs AI it's non-existent. They just drive the line and that is it... )  -Kunos doesn't listen to their customers as to what they want in this game and consistently release DLC's that no one really asked for and are priced terribly high.   -I tried a g27 a TS500 and a Fanatec. Sadly they controls are just too senstive. I've tried everything to reduce them from within the game or outside and it doesn't reduce sensitivity. Other games easily have this problem solved by allowing you to change sensitivity of your pedals and wheels but this doesn't exist in Assetto. The closest thing they have to sensitivity is brake gamma which really has a set curve that you can move along and with nothing for steering or for accelerator settings... I do not drive any car with TC or ABS even if it comes as factory. For me that kills all the fun in braking with the right pressure and actually preventing your car from spinning out when coming out of turns or braking hard. Some people like just pushing down on the brakes and letting the abs do the work for them.. To me that isn't racing if all you have to do is accelerate to full and brake to full... It makes no sense to me and i don't see any challenge or fun in that.. I've asked Kunos many times to simply add settings for sensitivity but alas as you can see they just ignore everything even though Kunos well knows it will help alot of people out. You can go and type in sensitivity with assetto corsa in google and see for yourself.  -Very bad multiplayer setup. If you want to host a server for a simple race with some friends be prepared to do your homework since it isn't anywhere near as easy as other games where you just click on setup server or custom server or start an internet game. Kunos has almost willingly made it very tedious to run a server of your own.  -No crash damage... You do see a diagram of your car come up and turn different colours as you damage certain parts but as for visually don't expect to see anything apart from perfect cars... Makes no sense to me....  - Nothing to do with weather or nighttime racing.  - No pit stops....  - Basically this game simulates a car i guess really well... That is where it stops. This isn't a racing game its just a car simulator. Please don't get mistaken before or if you buy this game.   The only reason i love this game.  - The physics are great.  - FFB is great and you can feel the car really nicely..   I'm sorry to anyone that wants this game so badly. I just find it so upsetting when Kunos has such a great game and there are very clear suggestions put to them from many people as to how they can really help change this game. But it is beyond me and this doens't go for Kunos only but it is beyond me why devs don't listen to their customers and tailor the game to what they want or need just like any other seller of any goods. It's usually a demand or a niche that people try to provide to which Kunos fails to do everytime. I mean simple things like allowing additional settings has nothing to do with whether most people will like it or not. Just give people the options to race anywhere with any opponents to have all steering and pedal options available... I really don't see this as hard or challenging in anyway...  Lastly and sadly... Assetto Corsa is the only game i know of where i had to do so much research and reading just to even find information that is important. I've got this game during Early Access and i've seen it grow but i'm sorry that Kunos decided to go this way because it saddens me that they really have a rough diamond in their hands... I just wish they would cut and polish it the correct way and the way it's customers want... I still get confused till today as to why devs don't do what their customers ask...
4895	0	a	I have played assetto corsa now for about a day and a bit, and i have to say that i do not recommend it. Why? Yes, the graphics may be really good, and the mods you can get are amazing, the reson that i have to thumb this game down is because of the AI. It is pretty bad. They seem to have magical powers of speed when they're in front of you, but, if somehow you manage to catch them up, they are the slowest thing ever, and not to say, at the start, they will take you out 9.5/10 times. This makes the game really aggravating for me and I can count on 2 hands how many times i have finished out of the at least 40 races i have started. Yes, everything else is pretty much spot on, but if you can't get one of the most important things right in a racing game, it becomes worthless. I really hope that the devs bring out an update for this, as I really like every other bit of the game.
4896	0	a	For anyone wondering PCars is way more fun.  I like this game alot but I cannot recommend it to others for a few reasons. If you decide to buy it it will not be your loss but it seems that racing sims have been plagued by a few but significant glitches. Asseto Corsa is no exception to the palgue that is destroying racing sims lately. Maybe developers are trying to get fans to fall out of love with the genre and create a generation of non- drivers. IDK  The game has absolutely beautifully rendered graphics. WOW just WOW. Impressive. The cars , the tracks, amazing! Ignore the pit crews and fans and it is a 10 on the graphics chart. Cockpit view, frame rate all the above gets high marks no doubt about it.   The down side is the game play itself. How can I say it? It is unplayable. Even with the G920 Force feedback wheel it gets super low marks on the fun scale. No fun, just frustration. I will go into detail for those like my self who desparately want to believe that is must be some terrible mistake.   Physics. On track contact goes like this. I am driving a balloon the AI is driving a Mack truck .I get tapped and all hell breaks loose, that simple. I can ful speed rear-end an opponent and they might wiggle a little before recovering and driving off. That is no way to play but the AI will run you right off the track and you can do nothing about it, including drive away. They pin you and you are stuck together like two magnets. WTF?  Realism. Ok guys so lets race. I have played a score of racers. Sims and arcade. This game asserts itself as a sim no doubt. The AI runs a perfect line everytime. Accelerates perfectly every time. My car however has no consistency in its handling. Tire wear ? Whats that? Keeping the RPMs up? No such thing. Drafting? Nope. Rules? Who needs those , just drive across the grass because that is the only way you can win a lap.  Ok so lets turn the difficulty all the way down and set opponent strength to it lowest. Now it becomes like a Sunday drive. Try turning even one of the difficulty features up to make it more realistic and once again it just become unplayable.   It is really sad because this game had so much potential from appearances. It makes me sad because they come close but miss by so much. Just another beautiful game plagued by zero fun game play. The jokes on me.
4897	0	a	Uhm , recently assetto corsa does not load , i have updated it , while going on play button does load screen and goes back to menu , ALSO whenever i am in the menu le wild steam page with assetto corsa dlc page comes up in my browser wtf
4898	0	a	This game looked promising while it ran, but constant crashes and troubleshooting ruined the experience. I deem this game completely unplayable.  I am sure it works for some people, but I have reached my limit for trying to get a game to work. There are lots of other race games on Steam that don't require dozens of workarounds.
4899	0	a	- carrier is joke and its is pretty much pointless / but hey u can mod'it. - A.I its another joke / yes sometimes they leave you space on the road... just to ram u on next corner xD -game crushing sometimes &lt;for no resonable reason&gt; -not much content / ofc u can buy DLC or mod'it. -no ingame setup for DFGT &lt;yes im not so pro im driving without clutch&gt;  -/+ graphics +running nice on older PCs / ingame presets changing colors,saturation etc.-yes u can mod'it2   - not as nice as pCars  + multiplayer track days and events ( -kinda unclear menu what 2 at begining) + good game for Hot Laps fun      
4900	0	a	Graphics are not even CLOSE to what shows in the videos in the steam page. VERY disappointed since the only reason that I bought this game, which is JUST standard racing game with very standard graphics. VERY DISAPPOINTED and feel that the game was sold based on the graphics (check the videos on the steam page) and they aren't spectacular with everything on ultra (TITAN X here).  BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
4901	0	a	Pro's:  - graphics - sound (better on some cars, worse on others) - amount of options  Con's:  - quantity of content - polish - no weather options - AI - Anti-Aliasing  I had bought the game previously, right after the game went retail, and now I bought it again. Honestly, this game still doesn't feel close to being retail at all. Yes, it's stable and won't crash or drop you back to desktop easily. But that's about it. There's only a handful of profiles so you'll most probably have to setup your controller from scratch. Some functions don't even work, like the joystick on my wheel (normally used for looking around or navigating menus), or are the wrong way around by default (Fanatec pedals).  The default FFB feels artifical and leads to heavy jolts of the wheel now and then. It never feels like a real tire though. The default setup of pedals &amp; brakes (gamme curve) is very nice though and allows for some spectacular feathering. The graphics are nicely detailled and the framerate is rather high, yet the game never really feels smooth and fluid. No matter how you set up the AA, the screen will still drip with jaggies all over the place apart, and that may be funny, the cockpit itself.  I'm sure this game will improve further any maybe in a year or two it'll have the content and polish of a true retail game. Right now, all I'd recommend it for is the Ferraris and, of course, the laser-scanned Nordschleife.
4902	0	a	Well, after wanting this game for some time, and paying £40.00 and now its £23.00, its not even worth £3.00, total crap, every time i launch it, the tracks are that bright its un-playable, i have to keep pressing pg up and pg down to adjust the brighter than the sun brightness, then that starts to take away the eye candy, so no point in having the graphics on max because by the time you`ve turned the ultra brightness down, its to damn dark. Now, the handling of some of the cars are such a pile if sh#i#t#e, i have driven some of the cars in the game at speed around the Silverstone F1 track and the cars DO NOT handle the way they do in this game. Wished i had saved my money and brought a proper sim, like mario kart. Utter sh#i#t#e, DO NOT BUY.
4903	0	a	not recommended for anything but singleplayer!  worst multiplayer driving i ever encountered anywhere. out of the box there's no point joining multiplayer at all.   looking for a league now to get my moneys worth (i'll appreciate a pm if you have any suggestions)
4904	0	a	Paid full price for the game and got dlc for 5 bucks. It's a great sim from physics standpoint, but what troubles me is the countersteering. It's not right. It's very hard to recover a car when you lose the rear end a bit.  There also are not enough cars in the game.
4905	0	a	I understand this is a racing simulator, and yes the way the cars handle is better than anything you can buy on a console only game, but for this price (even the sale price) I was expecting a much prettier game. Not the graphics of the cars, but of the interface. It looks like something a highschooler threw together the night before it was due. It feels sluggish to the point where every interface just isn't natural. I found myself clicking things that weren't shortcuts but very much could have been. There are too many points missing in this game and until there is a massive overhaul in graphics and in layout, I will consider this a waste of money.
4906	0	a	Game was great in Early Access. The bugs and poorly developed features were understandable at that point.  Then they decided to release the game, while it still is inconplete...  In terms of feel I would give a 9/10. Best feel I get from any racing game.  Globably I can't give more than a 4/10. Severall features are too incomplete for this to be a released game.  Hope they improve in the future, instead of focusing on DLC's  EDIT as of 15/10/2015:  As I feared, game is still looks like an incomplete mess. Still not worth the full price if you want a solid experience.
4907	0	a	I have had some fun with AC, but the last twelve months have seen development slow to a crawl and the tyre model get worse and worse. It's clear that their efforts have gone into developing the console version which I have no interest in. All the while they keep pumping out premium DLC that only serves the splinter the community. I should be able to compete in a race against vehicles I don't own in a car that I have purchased instead I have to purchase that content just to get on a server even if I don't feel like buying the car. The AI in this game is also terrible, some of the worst out there, they can't get around a lot of the official tracks without having huge pile ups and will happily run you each other off the track.   I much prefer rfactor2 as an online platform, not to mention it's far and away the best sim out there right now. I mean it rains and a dry line forms based on where cars actually drive and rubber builds up where cars actually drive. AC uses a script that just seems to make the whole track grip up x amount p/lap. I have got rfactor2 outside of steam although I will be converting it to steam soon. I would have thousands of hours in rf2 by now, in some ways I'm glad it hasn't been counting all that time.
4908	0	a	this game will not let me play it because when i start it it does fine but when its time im done choosing my car and stuff i click start and or start engine and it just goes straight back to the customisation screen.... i do not recoment this game............. right now atleast,when they update it so it works, sure i do reccomend it. For the time being i dont reccomend it. 
4909	0	a	Way too hard on single player.   Is it realistic that you'd need to have a lap time ranked in the top 1000 worlwide in order to beat the very first race on the lowest difficulty setting?
4910	0	a	it's a great game don't get me wrong, i just can't get into it like i did forza on the 360... i don't know what it is. just not giving me 'the fizz'
4911	0	a	No car in the world oversteers this ♥♥♥♥ing much. Turning the wheel 1 degree left makes you spin and no matter how hard or fast you countersteer, it will act like you aren't even countersteering, or holding the steering wheel at all, and the spinning will go on until you either crash the car or the game.  EDIT: Now Assetto Corsa won't even start at all because it keeps redownloading the same 6.8 GB of update over and over and over. I even tried deleting Steam and all the games i had, including Assetto Corsa. I had to download a cracked version of the game. Get your ♥♥♥♥ together, Kunos.  EDIT 2:  https://np.reddit.com/r/pcars/comments/35xzjz/a_question_for_those_quick_to_trash_pcars_physics/cr8xlgo   ^^^^^ This guy said everything. I am ♥♥♥♥ing done. I can't even get a refund. This game is a scam, and immediately needs to be removed from steam. No wonder it's made from italians. (I'm italian, i know how italians are.)
4912	0	a	Horrible car selection even with first DLC theres just no variety everything is european with the exception of one single vette and you get about 10 tracks total so imo 30 dollars was a ripoff..and the a.i. is in serious need of work..really bland game
4913	0	a	I think i am a mediocre to decent player at racing games but when you can't even beat the first race against AI in career mode something is seriously wrong. Other than that the game just simply offers little content with tracks that could have been more interesting.
4914	0	a	I bought this in Early Access, and liked it, but was expecting a lot more content. I couldn't belive this was rushed out as a complete game, and now you are going to charge for DLC? Complete the game first!
4915	0	a	Before I start this review, I want to point out I am no stranger to racing games, or actual racing experience  Unless you have a top notch wheel, 144hz screen, and a sense of racing, this game can be considered a bummer.  I first played this game with my friend's amazing setup of a dual motor Thrustmaster, custom bracket setup with a Bride Zeta II, 27' G-Sync monitor, as well as a computer that allows for a constant 120FPS. The game was honestly a hundred times more fun than Gran Turismo 6, Forza, NFS Shift 2.  I myself have a Logitech G27, my computer chair and a 27' 120hz monitor, and a computer that allows for a constant 120 FPS, a far cry from what he has.  The game is incredibly unfun unless you have a fantastic setup, I'm struggling to even finish one lap before I quit out of boredom/frustration.   The game feels like it's still in it's beta phase with the mouse/keyboard menu, as well as the very lackluster ambient graphics.  The potential is there, but the execution is definitely not.  TL:DR: You MUST invest in a proper racing setup unless you want to play a game of struggles.
4916	0	a	I am running an FX8350 and r290, but the performance in the game is terrible for me, just juddering and laggy and unplayable, and the graphics are quite dated to be honest despite an evening trying to tweak it. I spent half an hour trying to setup my Fanatec wheel with it, but as soon as I restarted the game it forgot all my settings. The convoluted menus are far too mouse centric, I have to jump put of my cockpit just to load and start and race, and then try and jump back in before the green light. Why it doesn't have some basic wheel support for the menus escapes me...  I understand this is supposed to be a hardcore sim, but lacking those basic player focused elements just killed any desire to play with this sim any further, at least until another patch comes out. I've been obsessed with Dirt Rally instead...plug and play works fantastic.
4917	0	a	Save up and get Project Cars instead.  I can only recommend this game if you REALLY like the cars that are in it. As Project cars is far more polished, and has alot more content. (and a bigger playerbase too)

4919	0	a	I review this game as single player as I do this most. I have most racing sims at the moment from everyone there’s something to enjoy, I have seen a lot of mixed reports about this game but I thought I would give it ago, I haven’t played this game from early when it was released. I also got the dream packs awell   i started the game I have to say I love the graphics I think it’s about right for a racing sim and the reflections and effects I thought looked great, great detail on tracks, cars and cockpits. so graphics are great in this game. The sounds are good in this game not as good as race experience.    The cars selection is ok not as many cars as I thought in terms of racing cars but it had a good selection of gt3 cars. the track selection I thought was poor really not as many tracks as it should be for a game that has been about for a while. Really thought this was lacking.    When playing the game as a single player I suppose the ai has to be good for the experience and this is where the game for me goes down. They seem to be lifeless and stuck on rail, when beside them I had a lot of contact and damage. Even when I kept to my racing line. They just don’t seem to be aware of you, when I compare this to rfactor2 ai there is such a difference in the experience had when racing.   They call this a simulator I wasn’t really getting this when driving I felt safe all the time I could put the car through the limits and never really crash and burn. I think the driving has been simplified and that was disappointing takes the fun away from the experience of driving a high powered gt3 car.  The damage model is terrible, I can crash into a wall at 100mph and yes obtain some damage but still able to race, if I did this in other racing sims I would be out of the race. The visual damage is well a few scratches on the paint work.  Overall I was disappointed in this game with the ai and the driving experience, I think this game has potential but it seems that it’s never going to have these things changed or the extra simulation to make this a worthy racing simulator  
4920	0	a	Needs more cars and a more dynamic career mode.
4921	0	a	Game doesn't work. After setting up your race it says loading and then just goes back to the same menu.
4922	0	a	Don't bother if you don't have a steering wheel.
4923	0	a	It was fun until it started crashing every time I started a race.
4924	0	a	Meh. Assetto Corsa was near the top of my list while in development. I thought the physics were top notch and the tracks were amazing. Sadly that's where AC's amazing features end.   The game is great if you just like hot laps. Otherwise it's pretty meh. Clunky interface, limited cars, horrible AI, horrible multiplayer and pathetic career.   Get Project Cars for a better PC racing experience.
4925	0	a	I think Assetto Corsa has very realistic physics, good simulation, good graphics, but the game its a bit dull, its missing content. Its bad when you have to get mods to make the game enjoyable, and now I have to pay for the dlc to get a few more cars and Nurburgring. This game was a disappointment :(

4932	0	a	if you want a racing game, there are far better options out there. if you have a racing wheel and you like to play a racing sim, then this game is 'ok'. the graphics is not that good, there is no 'full' support for your gamepad and menus are very complicated. before buying, you may want to check some gameplay footages first.
4933	0	a	Imagine you purchase an elaborate cake from a bakery for your wedding, your kid’s birthday, whatever. The bakery has lots of customers and examples of their cakes you see in the store are impressive. You bring the cake home, take it out of the box and it looks fantastic. Then you cut into the cake and find that it’s literally half baked.  This is what it’s like buying Assetto Corsa.   Pros:   Looks good. I’m not usually an eye candy guy, but wow this is definitely pretty.  The amount and variety of car content is commendable. Both official and mods.    Cons:   Automatic pit lane speed limiter.  When a race weekend session ends, the screen just fades to black and places you back in the pits at the beginning of the next session.  No apparent way to review your individual lap times after a race weekend session has ended.  No way to do standing starts dumping the clutch with the car in gear (well known).  No assignable control to place the car directly in neutral. Race cars have had this for over 20 years. Amazingly, there’s half a dozen assignable controls for MGU-K and MGU-H hybrid power, but nothing for the simple task of putting the car in neutral.  Car will not roll downhill when in neutral. It doesn’t matter how steep the hill is or what the surface is. It can be off-track grass or the track surface itself. If the car is sitting pointed uphill, it will not roll backwards once you place it in neutral. Spin off uphill and you have to shift down through all the gears into reverse and power yourself backwards. You can’t just simply roll back.  Different behavior entering/exiting instant replays. To enter a replay you hit Esc which pauses the action and brings up a small dialog with a menu. When you exit the replay, however, you’re returned directly to live action in the car. If the action is paused going into a replay, it should also be paused coming out of a replay. This could be placated with a simple assignable pause control but alas, like selecting neutral, there appears to be no assignable control for this basic game function.  And the worst flaw...steering!  The way this game handles steering is an immature and absurd mess. I'm not aware of any other racing game for the PC that makes dealing with the most fundamental vehicle control (steering) such an arduous and complex task. Maybe it actually is technically more accurate. I don’t know. But this is still a piece of entertainment software not a commercial engineering simulation. New owners of the game should not have to spend 2x-5x as much time researching steering and getting it configured than they do actually driving anything in the game. And that’s just to get to the point where it’s possible to physically complete a lap on a track.  There is no steering lock adjustment as part of the car setup. None. You’re stuck with how you have your controller configured. Now couple this with the fact that cars have steering lock ranges from 360 to over 1,000 degrees. Which, by the way, are not visible anywhere from within the game. You have to find the values for each car online or activate a developer tool and measure it yourself while sitting in each car. Either way, you’ll probably need to keep a notebook or spreadsheet so that you know what values to configure your controller for  before  you select the car you want to drive. Had your controller configured for a car with a different steering lock value than what you’re driving now? Too bad. You’ll have to exit your session/race to either load a different controller preset or leave the game entirely to access your controller’s profiler software.  It’s quite possible you’ll enjoy this game if you have a wheel controller with 700 – 900 degrees of rotation and profiler software to control it. If you don’t, however, be prepared to put in an extraordinary amount of effort just to make the game drivable.
4934	0	a	i was excited to see a racing game boasting about graphics AND physics engine, however the car selection is nothing short of disappointing. im not about to pay another $10 so i can enjoy a game i just spent $30 on.
4935	0	a	Can't even force myself to play this game anymore. It just finds a way to ♥♥♥♥ me off everytime. Feels so dull and unpolished overall. Community is obsessed with it and think it's above god for some reason but really this game is ♥♥♥♥. Buy Project Cars instead it actually gets proper support from the developers and is WAY more fun to play.
4936	0	a	its as good as the manual ... what manual ? thats right the designers were to busy counting their cash before they got to this part of the game . and it starts off so well .
4937	0	a	What a massive pile of ♥♥♥♥ this game really is.  This game is constantly broken, and when i seem to fix it some how, it then breaks in a diferent way.  After finaly givng up on trying to make the game START on Windows 10 (as well as other games not working and the whole 'Microsoft sees everything incase your a terrorist' thing) i went to 8.1 adn the game worked once, letting me drive the newley added GT86.  Came to it today to hopefully finaly make a video on it, and i cant load any cars or tracks and it said some sort of .ini file was missing, after some digging around and finding ♥♥♥♥ all support and the forum being useless i decided to download a mod car to see if i could find the missing file in that. Guess what i found. The whole 'Data' folder in all of my default car folders is missing.  ARE YOU KIDDING  Even better, in trying to fix it, i have verified the cache in steam, completely reinstalled the game, deleted all the tracks and cars, verified it again and let it redown the tracks and cars through that and the 'Data' folder still is not there.  I would ask for a refund but due to the purchase date and how long steam thinks i have played i can't steam thinks i have played the game for 6.6 hours when in reality, its only about hour, maybe a little more, and the reason it took so long for me to play the game was because i spent so long trying to make the game start on windows 10!  Dont buy this game, should still be early access, and it would be one of the poor ones at that.
4938	0	a	The little bit I've played has been amazing... but there is absolutely no reason a game that supports Xbox controller inputs won't let you use the controller in their menus...  You literally have to walk to your computer to manually start races between races or even to scroll through the pause menu. The input's already there... just allow it to navigate menus!  I do not recommend this for controller people for that reason.   Given that they said they'd be working on this in 2013, I gave this a negative review:  http://steamcommunity.com/app/244210/discussions/0/666825525106158137/  ... and then disregarded more complaints in 2015...  https://steamcommunity.com/app/244210/discussions/0/492379159717320215/  ... and even more complaints...  http://steamcommunity.com/app/244210/discussions/0/46476145623035468/   https://steamcommunity.com/app/244210/discussions/0/598198356169749509/   I'll change my review to recommended if they fix this issue.  If you're a keyboard / mouse and Wheel guy, then this will work great for you.  Game plays amazing.  NOTE: Before you Flame me, I like OPTIONS. Sometimes I mouse / keyboard or Wheel at my computer... other times I use my controller on my couch... depending on the mood I'm in.
4939	0	a	Overall the driving is good, everything else is not good enough, no where near enough cars or tracks, the car list genuinely looks empty, the dlc is alredy mentioned in the list also,. Feels alot like this game has succumb to cash issues or just plain Boundry pushing devs when it comes to the margin between a finished game and DLC time, A.K.A operation cash rake (although everyones doing it these days)
4940	0	a	Its not good enough by supporting these games before they are fully released, they also want you to pay vast amounts more on DLC packs. I am getting tired of a promise of a game, only to be stung later just because i want to drive a different car around a different track, No i have to pay extra for that priveledge. Why cant we just buy a game anymore without all these extras I thought this game had promise, thats why i invested in the development of it. Now if i want to drive around another track i have to pay another £10 ... NO THANKS !!
4941	0	a	I support you during early access and then you have the nearve to charge me for DLC right after it goes full release????   Is it too late to ask for my money back?
4942	0	a	I really thought this was going to be good, bought it early access, awaited every update with anticipation. Then 1.0 came and went, no nordschlief full course, no integrated skin customization, still feels like my tires start two inches in the ground, extreme audio glitches, and minor physics glitches.   Then Dream Pack DLC comes out... theres all the stuff we teased you with that was 'coming soon'. Turns out they would like $15 more of my money...  All this coupled with cars that have no... i don't know what to call it... feel i guess. I can't feel the road change under my car, i can't feel the g forces in the corners, none of the visual effects in this game give me any sensation that i'm driving a car, in any of the views.     I really wanted to like this game, but unfortunately I cannot recommend buying it for all the flaws  After some more updates, they're at 1.6.1 or something like that, this game has become completely unplayable. I cannot load any car on any track, it just crashes to the front ui, and many of the cars that came with the game have no preview thumbnail.   Hopefully it at least uninstalls okay and I won't have to look at this garbage title at the top of my steam library.
4943	0	a	Assetto Corsa  I expected a lot about this game, the sheer number of positive reviews is astonishing, the high ratings from magazines, so much positivity, but I was kind of sad when I bought the game + the dream pack DLC and I booted it up to get my own impression.   There is a lot to say about this game and I have a lot of negativity to report. First of all, the launcher. As my desktop runs in the 4K resolution, it starts in 4K as well. There is no way I can lower it for the launcher at all, it just keeps running in 4K. Thats okay, it kind of adapts to the resolution, but a small portion of the screen is used, a lot of wasted space. Also, I cant seem to get it running windowed, it just MUST stay in the desktop resolution. Okay, I can look beyond that, although the launcher runs very sluggish. And when I witnessed the first launcher crash, I thought 'oh dear, I hope its just a one-time only crash.'. Unfortunately I was wrong there, the launcher crashes often.  So I'm gonna do a practice round, with any car, I want to see the enviroments, testing it out, getting a taste of the in-game atmosphere. Monza '66. Sounds good, lets see what its all about. I'm taking the old alfa romeo out for a spin. It loads up, ofcourse not windowed and in 4K. I specifically said that it had to run windowed, but it doesnt. Okay fine, lets see what you got then. I'm happy to report that the game itself runs smoothly in high settings on 4K resolution. Its running between 50 and 60 fps on my rig. Thats very smooth in my opinion, well done, thats a good start. The car handles well, the sound is great and the Xbox 360 controller does its work well.  So far so good! Now for a lower speed lap and look around a bit. Well what can I say .. Everything looks very static. The cardboard crowd, theres no breeze through grass and/or trees. Nothing lives in the game, except for the pit guy .. well he just keep standing there with his sign in his hand. It feels as lively as Race 07, an old SimBin racing/simulation game, but with slightly upgraded graphics (not much!). Also somewhere on the track, the road splits up, which makes me think 'Oh, the next round I try the other road, this can be fun!'. So I do that, at high speed I enter the other road and my car slams into an invisible wall. Yeah .. very realistic. Then dont give me the frikkin' option to enter that  road!  Okay nevermind, lets play the Nordschleife touristenfahrt, my buddy was all excited about it, yeah its laser scanned! Whatever that means. I thought .. oh its scanned, it must be VERY accurate and the graphics must be top notch then. I'm disappointed to say, it doesnt gets me woo'ed and excited. Again, nothing lives in the game, okay that ofcourse does the framerate very well, but the enviroment is all stiff and dead. First thing I try, is taking a blocked off entry gate to the green hell. Theres a wooden barrier blocking my way. No match for my sportscar! So I run into it .. BAM! The car is damaged, bounces off, the barrier stays up. Wow. Amazing physics, yeah in the real world, that would happen too huh ? Surely, they would see you like a prick in the real world, taking the wrong gate thats blocked off, but I'm very sure the barrier would break or fall over.   Again the car and controls handle very well, but thats where the good stuff ends. The rest of the game is mediocre and feels old. Real world physics are non-existent. Theres no change in weather. There isnt a single breeze. Its like the nuclear holocaust has happened and everybody and everything was frozen in time.   Theres a railway track next to the drag race enviroment. I havent seen a single train there. Its dead as anywhere else in the game. I have no idea how this game got past version 1.0. It surely still feels like a beta. Running into the end of the track does 'BOINK' again, no bits fly off the car, everything stays on, there is no damage model, I ran into the wall with 250+ km/h, nothing broke off the car, except for the textures that look dirty and wrickled a bit.  Fine fine, its all fine, lets do an online game with my friend. Lets start a custom game! Just us on the Nordschleife touristenfahrt, good idea, lets do that. Its impossible to start your own session. You must have a dedicated server for it, and you cant start your own online session. Okay, whatever, lets join a server then. Ofcourse we both picked a car thats not on the servers car list. Sorry, doesnt work. You have to use one of the listed cars or you cant enter. Really .. this game .. it doesnt make me happy. In the end, racing together was fun however, you just have fun anyhow when you're on voice and chatting about it. Just those launcher crashes ..   So the conclusion ..   I dont understand any of all the exciting positive reviews. This game feels mediocre. Definately NOT worth the amount of money they ask for it. You still have to have a gaming console for the best simulation game, like an Xbox with Forza, even that lives more in-game. It must be the lack of good, decent, racing simulation games on the PC that makes everyone so super excited about it. I'm disappointed. It doesnt add up to my expectations. Try again and back to the designing board.  Pros: + Runs smooth + Good car handling + Good car sounds  Cons: - Lack of number of cars to choose from - Enviroment is static and dead, no physics there - Multiplayer custom online games are a huge hassle - Launcher crashes on and on - No weather changes or wind  My PC: Intel Core i7 @ 4 Ghz, 12GB DDR3-1600 RAM, 256GB SSD, 2TB Hybrid disk, GeForce GTX970 OC 4GB, Iiyama Ultra-HD monitor @ 4K 60Hz.
4944	0	a	Worst AI in any racing game ever I literally have a video of an AI pit maneuvering me because it wouldn't alter its preset line because the AI in this game just has like 3 preset lines for each track that aren't even interchangable they just ram you if you are in their way (which you should be because their preset lines are racing lines) tl;dr if you take the correct line you get thrown into the wall by an AI with a better car than you and if you take the incorrect line you loose because the AI have better cars than you. Apart from that great simulator just ♥♥♥♥ everything else besides the physics and cars, glad I got it on sale ♥♥♥♥ paying full price
4945	0	a	I'd stay away from this game if you are here for Oculus Rift support. The game seems awesome when it works, but there are too many missing features and crashes in VR mode to recommend this one.
4946	0	a	I bought this game for the realism and multiplayer. The multiplayer is not good because it feels like you just keep driving in an infinite track. There is no sense of achievement in this game.
4947	0	a	I love the graphics, physics and force feedback in this game. But I hate that there is no real single player component. No real career mode (yes, there's one in there but it is not good, just a bunch of unrelated races with no real sense of progression). And the AI, though improved over the last few updates, is not good enough to race offline with. There are also issues with multiplayer and this sim, in general, just is not a good 'racing' sim, as it has been advertised. It's a 'driving' sim, not a racing sim and for me, that is a huge disappointment.  While I don't necessarily regret buying this (I bought it through early access, so at a reduced cost) I can not give it a recommendation. At the very least, I would only recommend buying it while on sale ($25-$30).
4948	0	a	I think it's disgusting to start milking money out of everyone who bought the game in early access.. No new tracks or cars have come in a while and when they do we should pay? If all the upcoming tracks and cars are dlc-only I think I'll just delete the game.
4949	0	a	I'm really disappointed with this game, it looks amazing in the videos, but even with everything turned up to ultra it looks awful, it also feels really clunky to drive and not natural at all.
4950	0	a	Release a game that isn't finished so we can release a DLC pack that contains content that should have been released with the game.  Top work Maxis/Ea Games  I do not recommend buying this game until its less than $10.  
4951	0	a	Still the best sim BUT Kunos have just decided that many of the features you need to set up a reasonable server with all the cars you want and a track rotation. is not needed.. They also just decided That if you want anything even resembeling a working multiplayer system You pretty much have to write it your self..   This has renderd the game pretty useless, because single player is terrible. and now Multiplayer is basically drive arround 1 track all day in a selection of 4 or so cars...   Do your selfs a favour and buy project cars. No project cars is not a sim like AC is. It really isnt, But aslong as you dont play asetto corsa you wont know the difference so you will be happy with project cars..   ME?? I cant play project cars because the feel of AC was a million times better so i cant go playing it as it just does not feel right or feed the information back to you that you need.  And i cant play Asetto corsa any more because 1.2 just killed it..  
4952	0	a	This review has been heavily edited. If you found it useful or unuseful before, your opinion may have changed.   I haven't re-written this review to say that, now that i have a slightly higher amount of game time, i fell in love with this game and i'm ready to recommend it. My overall opinion on Assetto Corsa hasn't changed: i do not recommend this game for a whole series of reasons. I just wanted to change the tone of the review and some of my pros and cons. Let's see.  PROS -The driving model is probably the most convincing out there right now. It is not 100% perfect, but it sure manages to give the player the feel and thrill of driving a fast (or VERY fast, depending on the model) car. Without any TCS, ABS and stuff, the cars react to every imput in a very plausible way, blocking the wheels when you brake too hard, losing traction if you try to go pedal to the metal at the wrong moment, and generally making a mess if you're not capable of handling them. Learning to drive decently in Assetto Corsa can be a tasking challenge, and it's very fun and satisfying, though sometimes frustrating. There are some slight flaws, pointed out in the cons, but globally it's awesome. -The magic triangle dampers-tires-track is depicted extremely well. The vehicle is realistically influenced by every bump (and with Laser Scan, you can only blame the track for being like it is), the grip is extremely realistic and you can select various asphalt setups (i.e. perfect, dirty, old etc.) that influence the behavior of your car. Very nice. -Online is taken very seriously by the community, and has nice races with qualifications and so. -Career mode is vast enough and as varied as the small car amount can allow it to be. -Adjustment to your car's components is extremely precise and well-crafted. -There aren't many circuits, but it's a rather good selection: iconic raceways (Silverstone, Monza, Spa), modern raceways (the Nurburgring GP), some italian tracks (Magione, Vallelunga, Mugello) and a curiosity (the challenging 17 km mountain climb from Trento to Bondone, also good for relaxing). Few but good ones, i'd say. And the Green Hell is coming. -The sound effects are excellent. Full stop. People say this or that racing game has realistic sounds, then play Assetto Corsa and drop their jaws to the ground 10 seconds after the car accelerates. -The game is very open to modding, to a certain degree (read: it has to be GOOD quality modding, otherwise go away. Kinda classy, but assures a high average quality).  CONS -The current lack of value for money. As i've basically said in the pros, the core game is there and works magnifically, but there are few cars (43, a large part of which are variants of the same car, like GT2, GT3 or such racing modifications) that don't quite represent what sport cars are today and/or were yesterday and few tracks. I understand buying licenses and scanning tracks is all but for free, but the game isn't for free as well. Its price is rather high. More cars and the notorious Nurburgring Nordschleife track will come, and DLCs are said to be planned up to 2018. But... -...they will be payed DLCs. No surprise, after all. The willing to cash in on a game through downloadable extra content is common. Kunos is somewhat justified because what they'll offer isn't already finished and ready to ship but is being actively developed, but i'm ready to bet these packs will be excessively expensive. The only hope is a lifetime season pass or the fact that i'm wrong and these packs are cheap. -I am forced to hit this nail a little harder. Stop being such elitist a-holes, please: not everybody can afford a steering wheel and/or is willing to buy it just for you. I have a different kind of problem, for example: it doesn't fit in my current room layout. Assetto Corsa can be as better as it can get with a good wheel, a full pedal set and maybe a gear lever/paddles layout, but you can't just shoot in the legs the users that don't have a steering wheel. Joystick controls are broken: accelerator and brake can't be remapped, thus forcing the player to revolve around the frontal triggers while the right analogic lever is also a good choice (i prefer it, for instance). Steering sensitivity is also way too obviously steer-like even while playing with a joystick (read: way too histerycal to allow the needed precision, because levers are way less accurate than a dedicated peripheral). So please please please, take 15 minutes of your developing time to improve those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ controls. -The racing UI is highly customizable, and that's good, but it has some flaws. The rankings can't be moved from the bottom of the screen, an uncomfortable location, and all the adjustments can only be done while in the middle of an actual event, a very annoying and inexplicable fact. -Now a quick summary of minor cons, not very serious but still annoying: 1)Having an automatic clutch, which even many steering wheel users have no choice but to accept, makes the car start in a very unrealistic way, unless you start revving the engine in neutral then insert first gear suddenly. Kinda annoying, sometimes. 2)Some technical issues (questionable optimization, anisotropic filtering having an inexplicable as severe performance impact, some out-of-the maps clipping bugs in Trento-Bondone and a generally last-gen quality in background and scenarios, needing some improvement). 3)Incomplete localization. The game is made in italy, but the default english text isn't fully translated (cars descriptions are still in this language). For an italian, that's quite a ♥♥♥♥♥slap.  Summarizing, i like how this game handles (though i'm limited by the controller i can still 'feel it') and i find it fun, but lack of content can be a problem on the long run and the very likely DLC spam feels depressing already. The game has quite a high price now, and though it has been officially released (current version is 1.0.4 when i write this review) it feels unfinished on some sides (dynamic weather will arrive in a future update, and don't come and tell me that's not a feature worth being inserted at launch, in a Driveclub fashion). So do i recommend this game? There isn't a 'meh, it depends' button, so i'll go for the no. But my judgment isn't negative. If you find it at around 20-25 euros, then spend them: you'll have fun, if you like the genre.
4953	0	a	Great game, IF it was a beta. Still needs a lot of polishing. Also, Steam Workshop support would be a HUGE improvement.
4954	0	a	Game wont even initialize when you go to tracks aparenlty common problem for lower spec yet still direct x 11 compatable graphics cards. But seeing as ive run poorly optimized things like day z and run gta on mid settings running direct x 11 50-60 frames and low temps so id try the game out as my graphic card was only thing on minimum list. As i said game didnt initilize when you went to start race common problem loads of diff things it could be tried em all nothing the games menu and actual game are seperate exe aparently. went to original forums and told rudly they wouldnt help and banned for slandering graphic quality of the game. all in all tried it on my friends pc not even worth it with all the bugs if they dont apeal to community they have now the game will fail good luck.
4955	0	a	10/10 WOULD NOT BUY AGAIN.  I really wanted to believe in this game but time after time of updates breaking mods it's not worth the money.  Okay let's say you buy it and play with every car in game. Great that's like 10 cars and it gets boring. I bought this game in beta and I know this game isn't even finished but yet you see it here with DLCs not minutes after the 'Official' release.  If they took the time to write the code correctly the first time they wouldn't have to change the sound files with every update.   Oh and let's say you like drifting like me, great no car really has enough power to have fun. Yes you can just throw it into the corner but not keep it without putting 10 degrees of camber.   This game had so much potential but they threw it down the drain. 
4956	0	a	Only enjoyable without AI racers. Career mode is not enjoyable at all. I was having trouble winning a race, went online and one of the strategies is to start off slow and gradually speed up your laps so the AI won't be tuned to run so fast. That's a strategy? It actually works too. Pathetic. I guess the multiplayer is good and the tracks and driving models are impressive. I just can't enjoy any sort of story, only driving. It's racing for no reason. I'm not upset that I bought it, but I can't say I would recommend it unless you just want to try some car or track it offers. Maybe some mod or later update will make it better.
4957	0	a	This game is essentially Project CARS but worse in every single way  worse graphics less fun expensive dlc boring boring boring. Do NOT Buy this game it is awful I had to refund it it was so bad
4958	0	a	Not a abd ddriving game but generally not that exciting either. I would say its 'middle of the road' lol!   Good driving experience whilst on track but no pits, controller settings dont work well with my joystick (no views using my hat), once you set manual gear change the car doesnt enable you to auto gear change.   Good force feedback from the road.  Project cars has more tracks and cars and is a far better experience all round. And I would say rFactor2 is also a better game if you can handle the slightly lower standard of graphics beause that game is very customisable and has ultra realistic driving conditions and tyres etc.  Also the career is a bit lame compared with other driving games you cant do Championships it seems only race weekends.   But the glints on the tarmac are nice which is probably the only thing I could say this game does better than the others. I tehrefore dont recommend it because there are other better games out there.
4959	0	a	I tried solution problems reinstall windows 7 &amp; 8 same problems this  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=At8UyXoYe90   Assetto team support no solved problems and no reply me only left me. projectcars are better than you f*****g right now uninstall your game goodbye
4960	0	a	This is the only game which I think is a complete waste of money!   Cannot get it to work. Carreer mode has never been able to work. I have a high end PC which can run witcher 3 on high settings, but this game is full of bugs and makes my PC shutdown every time I start a race.  Looks like it could have been a great game but I've been waiting for a long time for the bugs to be sorted and still terrible....  xbox 360 controller doesn't work in the main menu...again..this game is not finished and should have never been allowed to launch full of bugs.  Will never purchase an early access game again!
4961	0	a	Excelent physical simulation and good graphics. However, it lacks content (even with mods, there aren't that many). Sound, while detailed, is a bit of hit and miss (some cars sound really loud while others really muffled). AI is competitive but they just can't handle properly around you. I'm being constantly tail-whipped or rear-slammed as I brake into turns. It's downright frustrating.  Unfortunately I cannot recommend it in current state and definitely not for this price tag. Unless you're a hardcore racing sim player and don't mind paying more for less you're better off with Project Cars.
4962	0	a	I wouldn't recommend this game to my worst enemy. 17 hours or so of just trying to get my G27 to work. The clutch serves as a nice decoration and my 900 degree turning radius miraculously reduces itself to roughly 100 when 'playing' this game. Absolute worst force feed back, ever! Just a little bit of resistance. Wow.
4963	0	a	After prelaunch testing and many many attempts to like the game even past 1.0 I've failed. I don't like the physics, there's much to be desired from the car and track selection, the career felt uninteresting, the suggestion line appears to be static and brakes feel really inconsistant so it's really hard to go a whole race without accidentally understeering straight off the track. And of course it doesn't work with my racing wheel, and configuring a controller may give a lot of options it seems to give too much chance to ruin everything over actual functionality (like letting me configure my race wheel).  I know I'm not the best at racing sims but I've spent a lot of time with GT2 as a kid, and Forza 1-4, ontop of many unsatisfying hours of EA's various racing sims. So I'm no noob but I'm nothing special either. I could see this game really being enjoyable for some, the level of customizability on many levels is appealing but for someone like me who wants to play something close to Forza 4 on a PC (seriously Microsoft?) this game just can't fill the void.
4964	0	a	Great game I mod my own cars and have every car you could ever dream of. Thats the problem tho. Kunos really hasnt done much of ♥♥♥♥ for this game. don't blame them though it's the way of the gaming industry these days. The only way to stop them is to stop buYing, For instance gta 5 what a laugh you have to peorder like a month in advance to get some pay to win cash and the games a piece of ♥♥♥♥. I wish i could go back in time and never buy axc but i cant. so that being said i wont be buying many more games. this has become a snowball effect of early acess rip offs and dlc ♥♥♥♥♥ boxes,
4965	0	a	Not bad...not blow your mind amazing but it has its moments. I have a slighty bad experience, I use a controller (cant afford a wheel) and it is hell for the first hour trying to hone your skill but after that I was pretty impressed. I've played forza, gran turismo, dirt...etc you get the point so maybe i put it on a higher pedistal then I should have. After all it is sold and advertised as a raceing sim. I bring this up because there isnt much in the way of objectives or a story of any kind. I mean I wasnt expecting much but you litteraly start out driving a fiat...and thats it, no tutorial of the menu or start out objective...you basicly just manuver around the menu and start your career.    Other then the lack of a game feel, wonky controler feedback, and honestly a little more mediocre graphics then I'd like its not bad. Now beggs the question is it worth the 55 bucks (cuz trust me your gunna want the dlc). No....not really, like i said its not a bad game really its just not really worth the money...it has a pretty empty feeling. 30 bucks I would feel comfortable but right now I feel like I over paid honestly.
4966	0	a	essentially no customization or tuning, no weather. career is mostly tedious, boring and very repititive. multiplayer is a mess of servers forcing you to drive whatever cars the server wants you to drive. and now Kunos has decided to make me pay more to get content for a game that, in my opinion, isnt even half done.  and where is the GT86, nevermind.
4967	0	a	God awful UI.   God. Awful.   This game lacks the polish of a great title. I would steer clear and purchase Project Cars.
4968	0	a	God awful UI.   God. Awful.   This game lacks the polish of a great title. I would steer clear and purchase Project Cars.
4969	0	a	Currently I have to not reccomend it. I loved this game when it first came out but currently it fails to load the game, I press start engine and it begins to load in the cars and the track but then right when it looks as if its about to load into the race windows pops up and says that a problem has caused Assetto Corsa to stop working properly and that if they find a solution they will notify me etc etc.... However this is one of the most prestigious in its category and who knows my problem might only be in the unlucky %5
4970	0	a	Was so disapointed with this game, Multiplayer is dead only two Aussie servers up and career mode is iffy and boring as anything, AI non stop rams you and doesn't look anything like the screen shots (R9 290 Reppin with 12GB of ram) Car customization is weird too, some car settings you change have little to no effect like camber adjustments ect, which in the real world make a whole load of difference, I'd love to recommend another game but iracing requies you to get a bank loan.  
4971	0	a	Very difficult to control the vehicles (I'm used to Forza, with nearly max difficulty). I did not enjoy this game, and stopped playing after 5hrs. I'd only recommend this game if you wanted it to be EXTREMELY realistic, i.e. more realistic/less driveable than you might expect.
4972	0	a	Currently I have to not reccomend it.

4973	0	a	Be aware the AI in the game has some issues. AI cars have a set driving line and crash into you with catistraphic results to you but with no harm done to them. They will do pit menuvers and run you off the track just to stay within thier line. There are many other great things about this game but the AI nees some work.  There are limeted cars and tracks as well, however this may be resolved in future patchs. I would recommend this game if the AI worked well and there were more cars and tracks. Until those issues are resolved, buyer beware.
4974	0	a	I was expecting a lot from this, as reviews where so good, wel I found very very average. It's is not awfull but far from great, even the feell of driving is just ok. If I compare this what simbin has done in years or the wonderfull Rfactor, then they are miles away. Even the menus are just not slick enough, It had an unfinished feel. So got a refund. maybe i get this back in a year or so and at 5-10 bucks when the game will actually be finished.  Update January 2016.  Maybe you should call this game Early access alpha mode. There is still so many things that doesn't work, try a 920 wheel, it shakes, it is oversensible and more, in career mode i can't even click on the races anymore, in challenge mode you get errors midding cars or saying unavailable even if you have the cars and tracks. and seriously this game comes with 6 base tracks! hahahaha.  yes fanboys keep voting this down, The thruth must hurt so much!
4975	0	a	I was so excited about this game until I progressed to N-1 in career. Never before have I needed to play a racing game with stability control enabled. The KTM ( or whatever) still cant make it around the track without oversteering. If you really want a laugh, look at some of the default vehicle setups. I have set up cup cars, road course cars, and I am also ASE certified. I have played every single big name racing sim, and I think by now I should be able to get a baseline setup on a vehicle on an Xbox controller. Not so with this game. Maybe I will come back after I get a real steering wheel, and edit this review. I can't suggest this game as a racing wheel only game, seeing as I have no experience in that area.  6/10  Gives me the Rage  uninstalled
4976	0	a	The game, technically, is pretty good. But if you want to play a sim racer online avoid this title...unless of course you enjoy being punted off the road, at turn one, at every race, by people who qualified poorly and dont know what a brake pedal is for. Seriously, once or twice, you don't mind...it's online racing after all. But with Assetto Corsa it's all the time. Seriously ALL THE TIME. It's rubbish, honestly.
4977	0	a	I really wanted to like this game.... The physics seem decent, but don't cooperate with a controller (waiting to afford a good wheel) but I spend more time facing the wrong direction than I do on the track. This should be looked at and at least taken in consideration for those of us who don't have wheels. My main gripes have to do with the menu and poor graphic performance. In Project Cars, I can run Ultra graphics with rain and 24 other cars without a problem with my Nvidia 860m, but this game lags even with medium settings with just my car doing practice laps (which make it look like a racing sim from 2010) . The loading screens take forever, and it is overall just completely inferior to Project Cars. I bought both games hoping this one would be better with its modding community, but it is just thoroughly disappointing.
4978	0	a	+ Good simulator + OK graphics + Good looking menu (albeit a bit slow)  - Bad AI - Bad controller support - Bad multiplayer  Gonna try the new refund function
4979	0	a	If it wasn't for the AI in this game it would be awesome the sounds the cars are awesome but when your driving in a stright line and the other cars constitly hit you for no reason it makes it unplayable if you mess up slightly and slow down a bit they act like your not there and ram into you DO NOT BUY THIS GAME
4980	0	a	Sounds are awful and physics are just screwed up. IMHO there are better options
4981	0	a	The engine in this game is very good. Traction and realism feel very realistic. However, I feel it lacks some sort of progression to it. I would like to upgrade my vehicles rather than just tune them. Not into it quite yet, but it's not a bad game.
4982	0	a	Good: Very realistic physics, beautiful world and cars  Bad: Doesn't deserve the price for the amount of content the game has, despite having mods. And very boring to play in single player.  Verdict: 7/10, buy at sale.
4983	0	a	Took oculus' money and left us vive owners in the dust.   Revive works, but its far from perfect.   Paid dlc for devs and still no Vive support.
4984	0	a	Took oculus' money and left us vive owners in the dust.   Revive works, but its far from perfect.   Paid dlc for devs and still no Vive support.
4985	0	a	This game is not really enjoyable without a steering wheel and pedals, if you plan to play this with mouse/keyboard or gamepad, you'll have a bad time.  I think the game have good graphics, can't really say about the driving dynamics since I tried to play this with a gamepad and the steering was horrible (if I touch the analog stick the steering wheel does 3 turns instantly) so couldn't even complete a race. You can't remap controls if you select 360 gamepad config and with a custom config the steering is completly wrong.  Saw a lot of bad things, the sounds are terrible, there's very few cars and tracks (not even complete nurburgring, only the GP version.  Wouldn't recommend it unless you have a complete sim setup with steering wheel and don't mind driving only a few cars.  Also blur effect is everywhere, everything is blurry.
4986	0	a	I cant believe that the only reason that i bought this game (Nurburgring) is now being sold seperately as DLC, very poor show, wish I could get a refund :(
4987	0	a	This game could be great, if they would just fix the UI menu's. You can't navigate the menu system without a keyboard and mouse! I play this game from a sim rig in the living room and sometimes use a VR headset, what a major pain in the ♥♥♥ to break out a keyboard and mouse just to play this one game! Come on it's almost 2017, why is this game using such a dated UI that requires a KB and mouse? Sticking to Project Cars, and all of the other racing games untill they fix this one.
4988	0	a	The wheel support is annoying and the game lags often :I
4989	0	a	This is actually my first review for a game on steam. And I have to say my purchase was a big mistake. I had really enjoyed Project Cars and had generally enjoyed racing games for my whole life but having bought a G27 I thought I would get what most people called the 'best racing sim' around the old internet.  Put simply it is beautifully accurate, but really lacking polish in its presentation everywhere, to the point where I can't enjoy it. I am running it on a 4K monitor, and all the menus are in this tiny box in the middle of the screen. I had to scour forums just to find out how to use my G27 to it's full (900 degree) extent. There are games that openly call themselves early access and I know what I am getting into when I buy one of them. But Assetto Corsa feels like early access and didn't warn me as a consumer. It's graphically ok, the sound is excellent, but the menus are so ugly and unintuitive, and in some cases broken, it ruins the experience.  I absolutely love Dirt Rally, love Project Cars, love the Forza series, but honestly this just lacks any of the charm they have. I know it's a small studio, but it just isn't a game ready for release.
4990	0	a	Bought this to support the developer since they were planning on implementig VR support for it. Just found out that they decided to drop it. ugh.
4991	0	a	Game has a myriad of issues and does not work half of the time.
4992	0	a	Gameplay: Awesome with a steering Everything Else: Straight garbage.  Like everyone said, it's a hot lap simulator. i regret buying it early access, not that any early acces on steam was ever good...
4993	0	a	Bought this game today on discount. I simply don't like it in many ways it's done. Most tracks linked to DLCs, which have to pay. no way.I will stay at rf2.
4994	0	a	Touts itself as the 'The most realistic PC racing simulation' where it is in fact not even in the top three,  Besides the multitude of missing racing features standard in other titles, the features that are there all feel sub-par.  Specifically speaking after the 1.2 update these are the things that prevented me from enjoying the experience. -No feeling of tyres. Suspension, Steering and bodyroll but nothing at all for the tyres. -Slow inputs. Countering oversteer was too fast for the sim on most occasions. Very unsettling to have to slow down in this regard. Also had the consequence of feeling disconnected from the visual experience. FPS@160 RR@144 -Graphic fideilty actually shocked me. It's the first time I've played the sim since upgrading to a 1440p monitor. At 1080p, it could be argued that it is one of the better looking sims. Howver at 1440p, it is damned ugly. Textures seem very low res and the lack of fidelity caused a headaches.  After waiting since early beta for a decent experience with this sim, I'd have to say, it ain't gonna happen. I'd personally go back to FPS/RPGs if this was the best simracing could offer. Very Dissapointing i5/780gtx/GT2/CSR/R3V 26 year simmer.
4995	0	a	I echo many of the other negative comments on this. They released an unfinished Alpha as a full game and this game lacks many of the basic features you'd expect in a racing game. This is not worth the full price as it stands.  This game has all the gear but no idea.
4996	0	a	Its a pretty good game, but being told now that i will have to buy DLC for nurburgring, after supporting the game early, thinking it was going to be included with my early purchase, is a massive kick in the balls. It doesnt really work well with controllers either which is annoying as sometimes i cant be bothered to set my wheel up. Really dissapointed.
4997	0	a	A lot of things that the game has just igrored by 90% online players that fapping only couple tracks and couple cars, so if u don't like gt u'll get bored to play alone
4998	0	a	very dissapointed. asseto corsa call it a game its not even a sim. DLC'S all the time no updates to the core. if i can give my copy away let me know how and someone can have the piece of crap. stopped me from buying other titles to support at early stages. my hard earned $$ could have been spent on better than this crap would recomend not to buy it if looking for a SIM.
4999	0	a	The devs made us beleive it will be Vive optimized 5 months ago.  (the truth is on a flat screen, it's sooo boring, with 0 speed sensation, so we all expected a Vive support) BS, they justdon't do anything except lies, bans and delete posts on forums.  Bad company, bad support, and false accounts on forums for their own ♥♥♥-licking. Just hate these guys and their overhyped old game.
5000	0	a	Very big dissapointment for a super hyped game. Bad optimization, bad AI, sub standard multiplayer. The cars are nice and the physics may be great but that's not all it takes to make a good sim. How can I enjoy great physics if the game runs like ♥♥♥♥? cpu occupancy 95% message when my cpu is almost on idle? random fps drops in the middle of the race? no thank you!
5001	0	a	Be wary of this dev. They sold this game in early access and promised more features and proceeded to make the vast majority of them paid DLC. Shifty as all get out.
5002	0	a	Good:  - Nice looking tracks and cars - Most tracks are laser scanned - Great selection of cars - Driving feels good - Nice force feedback - Great options menu - Frequent updates and DLC  Bad:  - No weather - Game engine only supports one light source so there is no night - Tracks are very static - No dynamic grip build up on the racing line - Career mode is basically some random events slapped together - AI is mediocre - This game is a oculus rift timed exclusive - Slow development because it is a small dev team  Overall not super bad but not the holy grail like some people make it out to be. There are better options out there (iRacing, rFactor 2, RaceRoom, Automobilista).
5003	0	a	I am very disappointed about the game, the developers. I bought the game when it was in early access. Now, 1 1/2 Years later, it just feels unfinished. Sure, they keep adding content, the physics are great, but its far from beeing a complete game!   No options to edit the grid No Flag Rules A way too less cars and tracks in the main game, so that you have to buy DLCs  And did i mentioned that there is at the moment no slipstream beeing simulated in this game?!  It started so good and development was very quick in the early stages. But for that money and that less content after the game was released, its just a big disappointment.
5004	0	a	I have only 22 minutes on record, and I even asked Steam to refund the money i gave for the game... It wasn't like I expected to be. Very hard unrealistic control (played with Logitech G27). I have only 22 minutes on game, that's why I can't say no more about the game. On the all videos the game looks insane with nice graphics nice engine, everything, but before buy i recommend to download &amp; play the game 'pirate' and see if you like it and even then buy it. 
5005	0	a	Game is less than what i expected, which is not much considering half the time it does not work. Almost as bad as DayZ in my opinion. Looks half thrown together and quite frankly I reret this purchase entirely. Forza Motorsport was a much better driving simulator.
5006	0	a	The physics are great. The graphics are good, but not compared to Project Cars. Another nice thing about AC is that its efficient enough to run on my 11' laptop. The reason I don't recommend it is because the car and track selection is too small to keep me happy. I really hate exotic/hyper cars and thats just about all you'll find here. Put in some classics and some 'every day' cars and it would be much more exciting to play.
5007	0	a	This isn't saying I hate the game. That's far from the truth. It's a fun game/simulator that has a lot going for it. Laser scanned tracks, fun cars, realistic looking graphics. It just falls short of a true simulator.  Pros:  Fun cars.  Fun laser scanned tracks (THE RING!) Easy to drive, hard to master Great Graphics Modding! No Monthly Fee!  Cons:  Physics are not terrible, but not right. No simulated aero, fudged tire data, etc. Even on lower track levels, this feels apparent.  AI is ♥♥♥♥. There is no other way to describe this. I mean, it's gotten better. Certainly better than the Kamikaze cars in Project CARS, but compared to rFactor 2, this AI is by no means good. Modding! = Fractured Community without auto-download tools like PlayWithSix or built in tools. Horrible Netcode  I'd describe this game as a hotlap simulator. It's great for driving. It's great for doing time trials. But when it comes to dealing with actual 'racing', it falls incredibly short.   If you want a decent offline racer, go for rFactor 2 as a great simulator or Project Cars if you want a more arcade styled simulator.   If you want to race Online, rFactor 2 still has some great leagues. Also, iRacing has some of the best pick-up racing you can get (excluding the low Strength of Field rookie races. Ugh), and recently released the amazing Aston Martin DBR9, which is awesome.   Also: Stock Car Extreme is pretty fun too! :D
5008	0	a	If youre looking game like Forza or Gran Turismo, this ain't it.  -Only few cars -Only few tracks -No night time -No rain
5009	0	a	Multiplayer is still not working very well, no servers with low pings at all for west coast usa, rubber banding and disconnects prevent enjoying multiplayer racing. Posted on forums negative comments and was banned, now i cant look through the posts to fix game issues or even make another account for support since it is tied to the game key ,,,,  support sucks, mulitplayer is a joke. force feedback racing is great otherwise. going to give thumbs down becuase they do not allow reading of froums for support issues if you get banned or do not buy a copy of the game.
5010	0	a	So the game Is finally out, feels unfinshed with a small selection of cars and now they dump DLC on us for $15 ??!? Not to mention the DLC tracks, why are the DLC tracks the only tracks with the longer distances with them??!?? ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.
5011	0	a	There are already hundreds of reviews detailing all the things wrong with this game, so simply put don't buy it.
5012	0	a	I feel ripped off ...
5013	0	a	cheap game, way behind the competitors, no good wheel setup, dash setup and so on, no sim, just arcade game
5014	0	a	do not buy unless you have a full racing sim set up!
5015	0	a	it so bad, first it has like 5 cars and it is very expensive to have more i really hate this game is a waste of money
5016	0	a	If you can get the thing to run, it's fantastic! A wonderous racing simulator with emphasis on the Simulator aspect.  But that's a very big IF.  Latest update has made the game completely unable to even boot for me these days, even on a clean install, a clean install alongside a clean install of windows, verifying cache does nothing as it reads everything as a-okay.   tl;dr if it works, it's great, but never ever trust italian software or electronics to be reliable.
5017	0	a	In Assetto Corsa there are many different cars to drive. But some of them are only driveable when you have bought a DLC. The negative part of this game is that there are not many maps to play. About the graphics is nothing to say because they are really well made. The online mode wasn't really funny to play. The main menu is really confusing to find the right option you want to choose. I wouldn't recommend to buy this game because for me it was no fun to drive in the maps.
5018	0	a	Not fun at all, unless you have a racing wheel.
5019	0	a	I liked this while it was in early access, but now it's being marketed as a finished product.  This game is horribly incomplete. Career mode is a poorly-made gimmick, multiplayer doesn't work half the time, there are numerous bugs, and AWD isn't even complete yet. I find myself just driving around in singleplayer.  What pisses me off more is that they have the audacity to release DLC for an unfinished game. When did they become Ubisoft?  It's Gran Turismo 6 all over again.
5020	0	a	there's not enough content, simple as that.  why pay 35 pounds for a game when you can buy a much better racer for 15?  I'll admit most of the simulation is pretty incredible but without much content to usse it with this game becomes tedious and un-intreaging so I have to advise you not to buy this game.
5021	0	a	I thought I would give this a try because of the Summer Sale deal, but I have my regrets. On some of the tracks the sun is so bright. It's like a super nova. The colors are washed out it's ridiculously bright. It needs fixed. On the driving model. Yes it's good and the cars for the most part tend to drive differently which is nice, but it's very shallow, there's not much to do other than time attacks and over taking the car in front of you. The AI is simply put, stupid. The other cars drive on rails most of the time and will run you right off the road. Sure you can tweak a ton of things, but you can't setup a realistic race weekend with practice, qualifying, fuel managment, tire management, and pit stops let alone a realistic racing season? Racing games had all of this stuff and more twenty years ago. I don't see much more to do in Assetto Corsa than what's in GRID which is a sorry state. Skip this and try iRacing or RaceRoom. They're more expensive but better games.

5023	0	a	Graphics are decent, but thats where it stops. Too much dlc and not enough off the start. I bought it really for nurimburing but thats dlc... Controller compatibility is poor and hard to use. My mouse randomly jumps up and right constantly in the menu screen which is really annoying when setting up controllers. Adjusting controllers constantly to get proper setup. I spent over an hour just trying to get my controller to work right
5024	0	a	Game doesn't work correctly and by that, i mean it only worked once! Everytime I click on DRIVE the loading screen comes up for a few seconds and after that it goes right back to the menu! Without ANY explanation. And that's it. I can click on it as much as I like. It's always the same result.
5025	0	a	I was hoping for the game to be this amazing racing simulator. I read the reviews and it seemed hopeful. so I bought it and the dissapointment sunk in. Firstly....what the hell is the point of this game? there are no unlockables, upgrades, rank, or money. second...the campaign is totally unfair as the AI seem to be way to good. Not to mention its repetitive and you race everyone in practically the same cars. thirdly....This game gets boring quick, because there are no ♥♥♥♥ing goals, and no ♥♥♥♥ing unlockables , there are no reasons to play this game!!!!  This game has pros however; first...the sounds are easily 10/10 second...the physics feel real and feel good third...the cars feel almost real do to the looks and the cosmetics of it all  If I rated this game I would give it a 4/10 
5026	0	a	Bout this game a while ago.. It has a great feel to it and the cars and tracks are great, it just seems to lack the content of other racing games.   My main issue is that everytime I step away from the game for even a few days to a couple months and come back, I have to go through hoops trying to get the damn thing to run again. Most of the time I just get an error on start and it just won't launch.   My other issue is reading their guide provided no help. Go to their forums to get help.. Nope.. you need to register just to view the damn threads.. Seriously? Just let me read the troubleshooting threads at least.  Pretty tired of doing all this run around just to put in a few laps.. Its not a fair comparison but I'm just gonna wait for Forza on PC
5027	0	a	Bottom Line: In my opinion, Project Cars has this game beat in every aspect. Glad I got my refund!  Reasons include:  Extremely limited content, very few tracks, even fewer cars, no music, lackluster graphics.   Additional evidence of a poorly made game: garbage UI, no weather effects, no track map overlay, no useful telemetry... basically all the items Project Cars has is missing in AC. And where the F is Laguna Seca? What racing game leaves out such a major international track?   The only advantage I see to AC is the sandbox modding you can do. Why pay for an unfinished product that you have to mod to even function the way you want it to? Think RPGMaker for a racing game sounds cool? I did too until I saw the lack of polish even for top-tier mods- for example the 'community made' Laguna Seca track was horribly glitchy on top of being incorrect for the iconic corkscrew turn. Where are the fan made R34 GT-R's and C7 Z06's? Not worth waiting around for someone's pet project to turn up while you pay for this barebones game that the devs left to the community to support.
5028	0	a	I only bought this for the apparent NATIVE oculus support ok here is a list of appalling faults  Firstly Its not native otherwise it wouldn't need to have the *.ini files to be mucked about with or the screen priority's to be changed.  secondly it will NOT exit whilst being played and can only be pushed back to the launcher using crtl+alt+del. hitting the esc key does nothing but remove the sound but the game keeps running !!!  after doing the above the game will crash back to the launcher every time you try to race even after restarting steam and the game, only restarting windows then allows the game to run ; i also completed a race to see if it then sends me back to the launcher..... nope it just sat there staring at the car in the pits so... force quit and the cycle restarts.  the controls won't reassign, i hit a button when prompted and it just ignores the input even though it can SEE the input on the indicators in the setup screen   the track is nearly invisible due apparently to the exposure levels and has to be adjusted each time the game is loaded (and the game won't pause) so you cant get off the line and adjust the exp' at the same time and adjusting the exp' of course then makes the cockpit incredibly dark and is unusable    
5029	0	a	♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥ game worst piece of ♥♥♥♥ simulator ever seen don't buy.
5030	0	a	Filled with menu bugs, bad UI and now you get alt-tabed out to Steam Store DLC page every third click or so in game menu. Game turned into worthless crap thanks to this...
5031	0	a	Overall, I'm disappointed in this game. It's got great physics, well-optimized graphics, and awesome sound. However, the gameplay falls short and that's what we're after, right? Not as many tracks or cars to choose from as there could be, sure there's a modding community, but I still feel like it lacks native content. The menu is buggy, and the enviroment isn't all that fantastic. They could get away with small graphical details not being the best on console. I'm looking for a game that has gameplay features on par with something like Forza, but utilizies the resources availiable to us with PC, such as 1080p 60FPS with fantastic detail textures and models, and then going beyond the typical console racing game with the gameplay, because you can. Real PC gamers typically don't want simple quick gameplay like you see in console games, they enjoy more in-depth micromanagable type things, because the PC can handle that. It's a good game that's decently put together, I'd just like to see more out of Assetto Corsa. Especially with the price tag.
5032	0	a	PROS: - Awesome looking graphics - Nice sound - A lot to do  CONS: - No gameplay experience for low end or mid end users  (A GTX 650 Ti, AMD FX 4130 and 8 GB DDR3-1866 RAM is way too less to play this game. Only had 15 FPS on 1080p, 20 FPS on 720p and even on 480p only 27 FPS. Even with overclocking to the masximum I only had 20 FPS on 1080p, 24 FPS on 720p and 30 FPS on 480p no anti aliasing used, else the FPS will drop to 5 FPS.) - No NVIDIA 3D Vision support  (screen stays black) - Controller works only partial  (menus still needs mouse and keyboard) - The controls feel strange  (played Forza, Gran Turismo and GTR. But those feeled way more realistic) - The racing line is static or doesn't work with my hardware. - The AI is definitivly made for pros, never had a better placement then 5th. (finished GT 1-6 a 100%, Forza 1-4 &amp; horizon series a 100% but this is way harder.)  RESULT: If you have a high end PC with i7 4xxx / i7 5xxx / FX 8xxx series, an R9 xxx / GTX 9xx series give it a try. But if you have a lower end pc, don't even try. You will not get any decent FPS here. I can play Metro Last Light 1080p on max settings, including the 4xMSAA with 24 FPS on lowest, but here my PC can't even run the game on lowest!!! settings. The gameplay and a bit strange driving physics are learnable. The goals from the carrier can also be solved at 80% AI at least. But the performance is so bad on low end PC's, that it makes absolute no fun. And to play this game in overclocked mode isn't really possible, because it crashes every 15 minutes, Metro Last Light does not, with same configuration. It could be a really awesome game, but only for high end gamers, mid and low end can't enjoy it. Too high system requirements. I will probably give the game another try, when I get my new INNO3D GTX 970 Hybrid card and i7 4820k with DDR4-3200 RAM, but before it will be unplayable for me. :'( (\s/)
5033	0	a	Its Hard even with the settings on what should be the 'EASY' settings its not easy I have played racing games for years and never in a game before have I not been able to take 1st place. Also while you can play the game with a controller it doesn't help much at all the game is still ludicrously difficult.  The menu before the main menu won't allow me to go into career mode from there it won't load it.   I will say however that the game is absolutely gorgeous and seems fairly well optimized so long as you have a DEDICATED graphics card. I broke the new RUF car that was added into the 1.1 update somehow snapping off my rear passenger wheel? I didn't have the mechanical settings in effect but I have a screenshot to prove it.(not sure how to report bugs)   Pros: Stunning visuals  Extreme challenge for those looking for it Very detailed Tuning aspects for those who what they are messing with  Cons: Its Insanely HARD for the more casual racer  To really get the best experience you NEED a racing wheel
5034	0	a	For all the control options, they won't let me just shift with the triggers and gas and brake with A and X on my gamepad. WTH? Why do control freaks always end up in charge of game menus? This unfortunately makes the game unplayable for me.
5035	0	a	needs car customizations and all cars mode in online race so any car is available at least,wheres all the awesome cars??
5036	0	a	If you're heavily into simulation games, sure, give it a go, but only if it's on sale for like 5€. As it is right now, there's too many things lacking to call it a proper game.  Pros: + nice engine sounds + nice sense of speed + quite stable  Cons: - woefully bad AI - lack of tracks - lack of cars (six different Lotus', BMWs, etc doesn't count) - no weather effects - no night driving - mediocre graphics - career mode is, well, bad to put it nicely
5037	0	a	I really feel like this game is not complete. also the controls are not the best and there are not that many cars. it is very pretty thought.
5038	0	a	Looks terrible. Incredibly simple ai. Very disappointing.
5039	0	a	I bought this game and was really excited. Unfortunately it came up short, as the career mode is lacking and the whole game is lackluster. Get Project Cars
5040	0	a	I hate it how steam said that it was compatible with my graphics card and then all of a sudden it says its not compatible in game get your game specs right steam
5041	0	a	Its pretty bad unless you have some kind of controller/wheel. Even then... $50???
5042	0	a	Physics are ♥♥♥♥. I honestly don't know why people are giving it good reviews... Cars handle NOTHING like they do in this game. I kinf of feel like i wasted money on this game. I'd like it if the physics were correct. It really takes away from the experience.
5043	0	a	Absolutely disappointing game. Unrealistic driving, crashing with 200mph only scratches and broken windows and so on. Pitting also very bad.
5044	0	a	I don't like it. I have triple monitors and I can't change the viewing angle, so some cars im viewing from the hood and feel like im driving a semi. Some of the cars feel great and others are like driving a marshmallow. The cars feel like they are floating to me. If you want a real racing experiance Iracing is the only way to go.  There are not very many cars to choose from, half are lotus. The graphic quality is not what I thought it would be either. I have two GTX960 sli and 16gb of ram running this thing full out. The trees and track look good but the car interior is nothing better than iracing.
5045	0	a	i wouldnt know, it has major issues with my logitech G27 wheel so i havent sspent any real game time with it...
5046	0	a	Game doesnt work, I cant even start a race as the loading screen for the race shows up and nothin happens, then it returns to the menu again and again.
5047	0	a	I bought this as a replacement for forza 4 when my xbox broke. I was hopnig for a game i could do some drifting and this SEEMED like a good game. I was wrong. The car selection is a shard of what forza has. The track selection is about the same as forza. As for the actual gameplay i was VERY disapointed. Trying to get all the settings to work correctly with a usb/xbox controller was awful. Not to mention you cant operate ANY menus with the controller, which is really stupid. You cant adjust the settings in-game either so i spent an hour going in and out of a practice race to try and get all the settings right. As for the drifting, it just doesnt work correctly. Evertime i tried the car either understeered into a wall or it would just do a 360. This was with multiple attemps using different settings and different assists. As a racing game its alright but for drifting dont bother, it garbage.
5048	0	a	Sounds lag and not much to do anymore since multiplayer is dead
5049	0	a	Good game with great physics but lacking a polished career mode and does not have a great car list and subpar graphics.
5050	0	a	Very uncomplete game, is selling DLC already! clearly they had the files ready was waiting for victim to buy the game expecting more content only to be shafted! Avoid like the plague and focus on project cars.
5051	0	a	I bought this game in November 2015. It has NEVER worked. I have a number of other racing sim games which all work fine. Unfortunately I waited til after Christmas to sit down and take a hard look at the problem. I still cannot get it to work. I asked for a refund. Valve/Steam refused. I again asked for a refund, pointing out that Australian consumer law requires them to give me a refund if the product is not fit for purpose - without limit to how long before I ask for it. They again said no.   I am not averse to trying any reasonable technical steps to fix the problem. As a career computer professional believe me I DO know what is reasonable. I could not get it to work. What I then found was a long list of UN reasonable steps to take. Taking those steps could make other programs on my computer malfunction and it's just not worth it.  If you buy and it does not work ask for a refund STRAIGHT AWAY. It's not worth the grief.
5052	0	a	Good game with great physics but lacking a polished career mode and does not have a great car list and subpar graphics.
5053	0	a	Sounds lag and not much to do anymore since multiplayer is dead
5054	0	a	Very uncomplete game, is selling DLC already! clearly they had the files ready was waiting for victim to buy the game expecting more content only to be shafted! Avoid like the plague and focus on project cars.
5055	0	a	More DLC than base game content, oculus VR only.
5056	0	a	This is a review for testing it out in Oculus Rift. I guess maybe because it's a sim, but it's nothing like dirt rally or forza. I was hoping to get an other great racing game for VR. But it was just awful. Having to go in and setup the controls to try get it work properly. ugh. and having to use the mouse while in vr and not the controler is a buzz kill. Note you can only use the headset when you start the race, other than that, you are constantly taking the headset on and off. Hope this helps others with VR looking for an other racing game.
5057	0	a	I've tried playing this game a few times and never really had fun. I picked it up at launch to play with the Oculus Rift. The support was very glitchy but I wasn't expecting much and it was kind of neat for a few minutes after the couple hours it took to set up.   Aside from that, the menus in this game are TERRIBLY laid out. There is an overwhelming amount of options but it's all sort of thrown in your face without any sense of presentation and it feels very alpha. It took me too long to figure out where to begin, what the first challenge was, whether or not I finished the first challenge, and that I was supposed to open the menu on my own and manually quit the course when I felt like I was done. I tried setting up my G27 wheel using the included settings but I could never get it to recognize correctly and gave up after 30 minutes of fooling with the menu. A few times the game has crashed from menu and I've had to reboot my computer to get it to start again.   As for the driving, I can't say much as I've quit after the first couple challenges. I know this game is a racing sim and I have played a couple other racing sims before so I know what to expect, but I don't find the racing enjoyable enough to play further. I wish I had waited until this was on sale.
5058	0	a	Disappointed with the poor support for the popular Xbox 360 Controller which I have used and tried different settings with, which games like Next Car Game already have good settings without changing anything.
5059	0	a	Like others have said its good, kinda a hotlap simulator becuase the online racing is terrible. I perfer iracing all day but if youre not into real competitive racing and just want to turn some laps its fun.
5060	0	a	First off, this game does not work at ALL with gamepads that aren't specifically an Xbox controller.  Not only can you not rebind any of the buttons, you can't bind them period. All the buttons remain completely functionless with no way to change them.  And the game automatically makes the wheel spin at insane ranges of degrees, even though there's an option that's supposed to set how many degrees your analog stick should map to the wheel, it doesn't work. No matter what you set it to, it always acts as though you have it at the highest setting.  Also, the game does not allow you to change any options while actually in the game.  Don't buy this if you're hoping to play it with any gamepad other than a 360 controller.
5061	0	a	 Early Access Review
5062	0	a	Too bad Kunos aren't interested in OpenVR support. Hopefully they will rethink that.
5063	0	a	I am so disgusted with this game. Don't bother trying to just go in and race for fun with a friend unless you want to spend hours browsing multiple websites for various 'workarounds' and 'fixes'. I have spent the last hour trying to set up a simple server and it's still not working. Having a game in early access and then moving to an official release without even offering a simple way of creating a multiplayer match is ridiculous.
5064	0	a	With every update your wheel config gets deleted
5065	0	a	Game doesnt work with win 10, and they ban you if you mention it. Oh and now they are telling me to remove my anti-virus program that has worked perfecty for 10 years, but their game needs it removed... sound pretty shady to me. Avoid at all costs, you have been warned!
5066	0	a	 Early Access Review
5067	0	a	Not that much fun in 2D. Also, if you intend to buy this for use with your VR headset don't hold your breath. They tweeted in March 2016 that they had no plans to implement it. Too bad, it might have been fun with the extra immersion.
5068	0	a	I bought this while on sale and all I can say is that I deeply regret it. Support for the Logitech G27 isn't up to scratch. Gameplay, graphics, physics etc are all sub-par. I've put over 100 hours into Project CARS and it is 100x the game that this will ever be!
5069	0	a	i am not sure what developers are going to do next, i was going to hold off buying till this game gets in final polished state, but it dsnt look like it, Graphics are frankly horid, was expecting good graphics...store pics and videos looks crisp but in game graphics are far from it! only bonet cam is good for playing, and the cockpit one, but honestly speaking cockpit looks not impressive, Project Cars have way cooler graphics compared to this,  handling is really good though, like it allot! but graphics are let down!
5070	0	a	The single player career feels like an afterthought with thrown together races and time trials. They bring little excitement or feeling of progression, leaving you left wondering why they even bothered. Then there is the AI that leaves allot to be desired. There is no penalties or rules for any poor sportsmanship like ramming other players (or being rammed) other than being punished for driving off track with a slow down to 50KMH / 30MPH. For anyone looking for a awesome racing experience, steer clear of Assetto Corsa.  The physics and force feedback are very good and the only reason I get any enjoyment from this game is running hotlaps. I think that is the only real selling point of Assetto Corsa, as I can think of no others to speak of.  Had they produced a proper career with structured racing guidelines, I would have recommended this game. There is allot of potential with Assetto Corsa, but the developers need to work on the racing aspect to make this a successful racing sim. Instead they have moved onto producing DLC rather than improving a game that feels like a work in progress.
5071	0	a	Unless you own a racing wheel stay away. It tries to be a pure sim racer but allows no grace in controls. You'll lose speed in nearly every corner compared to other racers unless you can be extremely precise in your steering.
5072	0	a	Just another racing game that relies on pretty visuals and not on realism. Pass if you are looking for something decent.
5073	0	a	Half-♥♥♥♥♥ racing simcade on rails  -Terrible slip angles -cars snap on turns -Still no pitstops during races -Beta form at best -lack of varity of car classes and tracks -mods ripped off from other games GTR and rF1 and the devs let this slide  If you like hot lapping this might be the game for you. Terrible AI really makes solo racing pointless and career mode is a joke. If you want a traditional simulator look else where namely rFactor 2 or GSCE. I might also add this game is releasing in April of next year on consoles. Which in the current half-♥♥♥♥♥ state of the current game I would steer clear of the console port too.
5074	0	a	I'll say the same exactly as in Project cars for this game  The more I play it, the less I like it. The dynamics are way overdone beyond simulation. Without a wheel, don't bother. Without perfected throttle and steering control, theres absolutely no skid pad or room for mistakes or fun beyond simulated driving in this game. Looks great, sounds great, all the options are amazing, lot's of neat positives in this game and all the cool race trakcs as well. Decent game all around, just dosen''t have the fun handling.
5075	0	a	Assetto Corsa is extremely challenging. I cannot recommend this game for casual racers.  I've played many racing 'sim' games like Gran Turismo, Forza, and Grid. All of which I would highly recommend over cheaper more arcade like racers like the Need for Speed Franchise, Burnout, etc... With that said this game makes games like Gran Turismo feel like the cheap arcade racer games they actually are. This is definately a true racing sim for the hardcore fans.   Playing career mode is punishing. I managed a gold on the first time attack stage but was blown away on the second stage when racing a full grid of AI racing opponents. Even if you scale the difficulty of the AI back to 80% (lowest) it's difficult to finish in the top 3 positions. The AI makes no mistakes and follows the racing line perfectly. The only change the AI slider seems to make is that the opponents drive marginally slower, enough for you to win if you drive flawlessly around the course. After numerous attempts I was able to secure second place.  If you're like me and don't have the patience to master every single event in the career by practicing it over and over then this game is not for you.   The physics, graphics are as good as everyone is saying. In Multiplayer I'm sure this game is a real blast. I really wish I could vote this game up for the hardcore and down for the casual.
5076	0	a	i won't recommend it because its too hard to understand. In-Game UI are very messy. I bought this game while it still in beta... for way more then right now, when the game is finished. I'm sure many will agree with me, all user that buy this game on its beta stage should get all DLC from now until ever for free, because we pay more than standard game fee. Its like you pay for game with season pass.  for people who is looking for a very technical game, this one is very recommended though. I can give 8/10 for all aspect but i will not recommend this to a normal person. only a hardcore enthusiast will get this game and enjoy it.  for the last time, WE PAY MORE FOR THIS GAME DURING THE BETA VERSION, WE SHOULD GET MORE FROM THIS GAME FOR THE FORSEEABLE FUTURE!
5077	0	a	I play this game at a friends house so i have more than 30 min on here. I love this game but with xbox controller it sucks. The wheel is so much nicer. Also I had never realized how complacted it was to set up everything from scratch. And to be honest the graphics are very disapointing. I have been a PC gamer longer than iv been playing Forza. If u like Racing sim and have xbox just get that b/c this to me is a crap sim. But like i said i am a forza guy. If you want any custom cars u have to get them online and put them in this isnt a problem if u know how to do somthing like that. I just hate the fact that i got this game thinking i would be abel to do alot more from the start. I have hours of downloading and modding to make this game like i have always played it at my friends. This kinda upset me mainly b/c my dude told me to put stuff in the wrong folder and gave me crap links to get the cars. So i had installed and reinstalled like 3 times in one day. But After all that at the end of the day it is a very fun game. Just be prepaird for lots of frustration on navagation threw menus and having to go back and forth so much just to change settings and controls. Honestlly This game out the box is not any where close to worth what it cost but after hours and hours of downloading and changing stuff up it can be awsome. I am going to Not Recommend this game just b/c of that reason pretty much. There are not much for updates and from everything iv read the company has no plans to ever try and fix any of the navagation problems with the game or any of the little bugs. But if ur a die hard pc guy and want a sim to me this is the best u can get still not worth 50-60 bucks tho.
5078	0	a	Since most people here have their nose parked up the behind of these people, ill help provide some balance. I'm not a hardcore sim-gamer, but i've played racing games since the mid 90's and i'm a big fan of track racing. This game managed to really get on my nerves, and this review was written when i was still in a pretty foul mood.  - Yes it's a fancy looking game, but still nothing not better looking than titles released 10ish years ago .. its not FANTASTIC in any way. I would have looked great 10 years ago, today it simply takes more ...  - The sound is mediocre, cars sounds lame (are the sounds even recorded in stereo?). Again, theres nothing 'amazing' or 'fantastic' about it.  - The gui is confusing and the configuration not very intuitive. It took me 10 minutes to find where to disable raceline and all the stupid driving aids, i mean; 100% ABS, 100% traction control and gear shift help as standard .. really?? There's no feedback when selecting anything, no 'activate setting' and '[x] settings activated', just click the 'go back' button and hope it works (which it didnt). Two 'start'-buttons to start the race ... why? And two buttons almost next to eachother, that takes me to the same car properties screen ... It had my G27 (what is a 'G27 900'?) in the wheels list, so i guess thats a plus .. but once i clicked and 'activated' it, it wasn't highlighed anymore. Confusing.  - Tripple screen support is a joke (in my case, im sure others have got it working); it lets me select it but it never worked (i never got more than one screen in 'race mode'). I cant select resolutions because theres no 'drop down' where theres supposed to be one, just a white square that does nothing. Even Farming simulator 15 have better tripple screen support. When trying to resolve it i find a link to  assettocorsa.net , but to read it i HAVE TO LOG IN .. are you kidding me?? By this time (1 hour later), i'm so ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at the stupid company there no way im giving them anything else, they already robbed me of 45 Euros. - I tried editing the video.ini and triple_screen.ini-file in the game folder but nope. - I have 2 ASUS and 1 Dell monitor (all 27' 1440p, GeForce GTX970), and nVidia wont let me do spanning in nVidia settings, but i've managed to get triple screen working in all other games i've tested so far.  As you can clearly see, i've had a really bad experience from this game and my review will reflect that. It obviously isnt all bad or it wouldnt get 85/100 ... but i didn't pay 45Euro for a beta or early access, but thats what i got. It also feels like thats what's what most people have reviewed it as. I dont think they will mend the confusing gui, but i could get used to that. If they continue to release fixes for everything else, i might come back to this game some day and get my 45 Euros worth ...
5079	0	a	Lets just start with saying if you not own the correct sterring wheel then you cannot play this game! Since the default button layout are made by aliens and same with the reaction for buttons, and nothing can be changed in game menu all buttons are locked = not worth a buy (not even for free you should take this)  ps. Never have i felt so cheated and scammed as i did with this game thought it would be one of my favorite games but instead i can only rate it 0.5/10  (remember to read the link i have posted since this explains evrything)
5080	0	a	The game keeps crashing and posting the following message: 'launcher stopped working.' I've tried to fix this in many ways but still, the game crashes. Hopefully someone can guide me the right way. All the best. -H
5081	0	a	The difference between lowest settings @720 and highest settings at @1440 is 10fps, specifically those that occupy the space between 40 and 50. This game does not run well, and if like most people you consider 60fps to be the minimum playable framerate then you will be very angry with this console peasant simulator.
5082	0	a	the game is quite fun with a wheel, complete fail with a controller (360) i dont recommend because of the lack of tracks and cars for a racing game there really isnt much to it. very short career with set cars you have to use. glade i got it in a sale this game is quite dear for what it is
5083	0	a	Giving AC a try every 6 months since I got it in early access and it didn't improve much. But what makes me more hopeless about this game (not going to call it a sim....) is Kunos interviews. I just can't say the guy want to do a simulator whenenever he talks in any interview and this is being proved in the game... So if you are more of a casual gamer and not exactly a sim racer buy it. It will worth every cent. But as a simulator you got better choices out there so as I'm judging something that calls itself a simulator I can't recommend it.
5084	0	a	It's ok, but it is no iRacing
5085	0	a	This game is a good one but if you are looking for a better games for FFB wheels IRacing is a better way to go because i do not feel when the tires come off the grond or can i feel the bumper strips and nurburg has a rougher roads than they depict
5086	0	a	I reccomend this game to people who are big into really realistic racing games cuz i got it and im not very big into it and im bored of it cuz its hard sometimes
5087	0	a	♥♥♥♥♥iest mp in history of racing games. Otherwise quite decent.
5088	0	a	This game is lagging on my two gt 210's, how the hell is this possible.
5089	0	a	♥♥♥♥
5090	0	a	Terrible VR support. Wouldn't even call it supported at all. Still haven't updated to 0.7 runtime and Rift is already on 0.8. DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU WANT TO USE IT WITH OCULUS RIFT!
5091	0	a	Pros: Very well made driving simulator Somewhat realistic damage to cars during race Uses real cars  Cons: Too difficult Unlocking cars is too easy Not enough cars
5092	0	a	I've played everything from the Microprose days through TOCA, GTR 1 and 2 all the way to RBR and the like.   I've spent months just with data logging on GTR 2 for the perfect setups.   I can not get what the fuss is about this game. I've tried but this is just not value for money to me. Thank heavens Dirt Rally is available and in a few hours Project Cars.  Sorry, but I can't recommend this.
5093	0	a	i tell them why they should not bother if you like multiplayer: i was blacklisted for loosing controll of my (fictional) car and crashing into others.....i was hit in the back along the straight at Monza....French servers again.....nothing was done.....excellent game online baby's race against....
5094	0	a	Dont bother buying this poor excuse for a racing game. Its still real buggy, not complete and the devs are already adding DLC for an unfinished game. That is what is destroying the gaming industry already and this is just taking it too far.  Plus game, what little there is of it, is not even fun.
5095	0	a	Firstly had difficulites getting the actual game to work. Then when I did was disappointed with the handling and graphics in the game. Haven gotten into Raceroom I found it to be a lot more fun to drive using the G27 steering wheel than this. Not just from easiness point of view, but the way the cars handle in this game dont really remind me of how my own car handles.
5096	0	a	For a driving sim, I didn't like agree with anything about like this game in early access. I put it down for months hoping it would become equal to Forza but PC. Playing it now, it's basically the same thing with less bugs.   There isn't enough content to keep interest. What is interesting, is DLC. Its like that 'Next car simulator' game, it'll hold your attention for about 10 minutes.  Its still an underster simulator. Most of the time your wheel is maxed out to a side, and you slide forward but don't spin out. Its a poor simulation of how a real car handles.  The multiplayer server browser is such a bad and frustrating system.  VERY MUCH REGRET THIS PURCHASE!
5097	0	a	I wish I could get my money back. I have been trying for a week to get it to run just ok. Iracing took me only 3hrs to get it to very good.
5098	0	a	Get Iracing its a real driving sim not this arcade game. I see reviews saying perfect game perfect sim maybe with a gt force or thrusmaster/madcatz but with a real sim setup this game is garbage. This game is just Gt6 polished for pc its pretty and sounds good but thats where it ends. Tried in beta form and it was terrible and have now tried fullversion which is an improvement but still feels like a arcade racer with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t lap times and corner speeds. This is a game so don,t call it a simulator because it will teach you nothing about really driving a race car. And yes iracing was not very good about 2 years ago but in the last year has been redesigned a few times and is now the one to go for. It didn,t win Best Pc Driving Sim ever made for no reason.
5099	0	a	Do yourself a favor and find something else if you are looking for awesome graphics and driving experience. I played about 30 minutes and could not stand the graphics quality. I had max settings on and it looked like trash. Requested a refund already.
5100	0	a	Shaun Cole was right all along, this is an arcade racing game. Don't be fooled by PR talk or fanboys, this is no SIM race title, and it never will be, think a cross between the Forza series and the Gran Turismo series, but without the fun of having many many cars and tracks... Truth be told, it is abit of a bad joke that this is branded as a 'next gen' SIM, much like how Gran Turismo is marketed as 'The ultimate driving simulator'   - engine supports only 1 light source = this game will never feature night time driving... - changeable weather? i haven't seen any in any case... - no timed racing, only option is to set x amount of laps - no rubbering in of the track - no damage model - press escape during an online race, and you end back in the pits with a new car, ready to go out (and wreck) again - tyre model? i doubt it - ridiculously small amount of input options - community - BIGGEST deal breaker: racing online, when someone finishes it sets off a timer, if you don't cross the finish within that time, your screen just goes black and are taken to the results page TAKING AWAY ANY INCENTIVE to even start a race !! what's the bloody point in driving x amount of laps on any track, if you can't finish your race because you are not in P1 ?? Or close to him?   All in all, nothing in the game is geared towards beeing a racing SIM, eyecandy and stupid showrooms are the order of the day in this title, wich is fine if you are looking for that kinda of game (and don't have an Xbox to buy the much superior forza series), but not so much when you are duped into thinking this is a propper SIM.  background: 10years + of SIM racing on titles as FIA GTR, Rfactor, FIA GTR2 and Rfactor2
5101	0	a	you better have a monster computer, this game needs alot of work. i could be the next GT. wait till it is on sale!!
5102	0	a	As much hype as this game got, it still feels stale and dated. It's an okay game, but that's about it. A racing game without a good AI is not a good racing game. Even Gran Turismo has AI that can overtake slower cars. Even Gran Turismo 1 had that.   If this review gets me banned from the official forums, then it just shovs that they can't take any critique. (It's not even harsh.)  5/10 - It's okay for hotlapping. If you can get your settings right.
5103	0	a	unplayable. cars spin off at the first corner and some even when going in a straight line. xbox config wont let me have the triggers as brake/gas like in all other games. joke of a game. and all the good tracks and cars cost extra!   DLC WARNING! BAIT AND SWITCH
5104	0	a	Thought I was buying a game on par with Iracing. This is not. Iracing is leagues in front of this. Shame.
5105	0	a	To be a real simulator, it needs lots of improvements.  - Clutch button does not exist - I cant assign mouse buttons for shift up/down nor anything but accel/brakes - Mouse stering configs very poor (no dead point, tolerance, etc) - With G27, many functions needs very much work and calibration to get working  Resume: - The game looks good, but dont worth the price
5106	0	a	'Oculus Rift Early Support' = Supports barrel view but good luck getting through the menus and actually into the car. Tried a long time ago, wrote a bad review and got hassled by a fanboy. Well, here it is nearly a year later and still no support.  I bought this BECAUSE it stated it had support but clearly this is unsupported.
5107	0	a	After many many many months of knowing the cause of the problem, the resolution switching bug has not been fixed, nothing has been done about full controller support for menus, and any and all fixes have been for the gameplay and not the game itself.  Once you're racing, assuming you're not cursing at your screen resolution configuration being ignored, the game is fun. It's the closest I've felt to Forza on something other than an Xbox, and definitely feels better than any Gran Turismo. But why is there DLC for a game that still doesn't feel complete? Moreso, why is it shoved in your face while going through menus? 'for only $25, you could be using this car on this track!' I'm sorry, no. If it weren't for that I bought the game well over a year ago, I'd be looking for a refund at this point, because it feels I'll never get my money's worth, especially when the game keeps asking me for more money.  I really really really wanted to like this game, and the potential for me to do so is very much there, but I feel like it will always keep me at arm's length, at best.
5108	0	a	I love a driving game, and I love realism, but this is not a game. It's a simulator. How is it a simulator and not a game? It has a career....?  Firstly, the XBOX controller support is poor. If you want an axis-based control mapped to a button (i.e. clutch), you're screwed. And vice versa (i.e. camera look). None of the menus support controller navigation and there is no optimal configuration.  Secondly, there's no music library to add fun to driving in the program. No background tracks meant to improve the experience, catered for the buyers to enjoy.  Thirdly, some of the stuff doesn't work. The driving lines that are meant to tell you the best way to drive for a fast time are very often wrong, and by disobeying the lines, you can shave several seconds off your time on even a small circuit.  Assetto Corsa had the possibility to be what Gran Turismo and Forsa Motorsport are for consoles, but it fell short by JUST trying to be a simulator.
5109	0	a	not a bad game not the best sim out there but its close enuf its good how you can add mods but i personaly think project cars will be better over all tho AC still good game i recomend it but i dont think full price is worth it   id say wait for project cars to be fair.  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ was before career was put in DO NOT BUY utter rubbish the devs distroyed a good game i for one want a refund of this game dont waste your money!!!  ive played allsorts or sim racers forza race 07 f1 to grid need for speed moto gp..  and this assetto corsa utter bull cod please do a favour do NOT BUY IT ITS CRAP!!!!!
5110	0	a	Can't start a race after update... woohooo
5111	0	a	Visual quality is low for the fps you get. Physics and mechanics feel like an arcade game. Forza 4 seems better on the xbox 360 for physics and traction (more realistic (actually takes skill)).
5112	0	a	sucks
5113	0	a	This game is horrible, AI is too good, it never makes mistakes, no point in having damage on because you will just be in last place. There was no point adding controller support because obviously this game will only work well with steering wheel, which must give you super powers because sometimes the AI can overtake me in the same car as me when I'm going top speed.   The game still feels like its in early access. very barren and boring.
5114	0	a	Could be a great game, but the modding community just isn't there. It exists, but not at a level to be satisfied with.  Not only that, but the community doesn't seem to care about realistic car's at all, on many of the older car's posted to RaceDepartment, you see idiots bashing the modders of slower/older car's, saying ♥♥♥♥ like 'This car isn't realisitc' 'Too slow' and etc, because the game is corrupted by Gran Tursimo, Forza and Need for Speed, idiots.
5115	0	a	Maybe its me but the steering is uncontrollable, the slightest input is magnified beyond any reasonable expectation, The graphics are nothing like the video adverts either. Very dissappointed. Not a patch on any of my other racing games.
5116	0	a	The game is very buggy and is incomplete. i was really looking forward to playing a game that would be close to forza but this is complete trash in comparsion. the cars are very limiting and now they are trying to sell little bonus packs like wtf, there is only 50 or so cars in the game and they are already making people pay for more... The AI is sh*t and how the cars act on the road is unrealistic. it makes you wonder if the devs have ever driven a car before. On top of all the sh*t the game appears to have died for me as i cannot start races. The only good part about the game is the graphics  spend your money else where
5117	0	a	Bit of a kick in the nuts from Kunos, this game is cheaper Retail than Early Access. Kunos you control the discounts not Valve, stop disrespecting your early adopters (unpaid testers) and undervaluing your game just to chase sales. No wonder people are buying the game from foreign Key Sellers - you only have yourselves to blame!!!! Get your pricing structure and timing right FFS!  As for the game..... I will update when I have played 1.0. SLI performance was terrible during Early Access, in order to play you needed to have static reflections and very low smoke generation, selecting anything else would result in 20-30FPS. Additionally playing in NVIDIA 3D wasn't the best experience. The clouds and mirror reflections were all wrong and this issue was addressed over a year ago and wasn't fixed during that duration, since nothing has been mentioned in the changelog about this then I guess it still has not been fixed.   Until I test this game further tonight I cannot reccommend this yet.
5118	0	a	Only aspect of this game that is actually good is the driving mechanics. Graphics are descent. Nothing remarkable, just ok.Everything else is laughable.   The cars that come with the base game are very limited. The UI, although functional, is poorly designed and often feels unresponsive. The AI is a joke and never does it give you the feeling that you're competing in a race. The game in general is full of rough edges. There are no pit stops, no weather effects, no night races. It feels extremely dull and empty. But the icing on the cake is the sound. That godawful sound. The engines' sounds are so flat and soulless. You can find games from the 90s that have better sounds and, to be honest, I'm not even sure if the audio is stereo. I mean, stereo should be the absolute least one would expect in 2015. I swear that not even once did I get a sense of space. Everything sounds awful. And on top of that, I experienced a cracking sound bug that took me a good two hours to fix.  This game is by no means a racing simulator. A driving simulator, maybe. If you don't care about jumping in and driving alone then you might enjoy the realistic car handling. But if you want anything more than that, you're more than likely going to regret spending your money on this one.
5119	0	a	If it dosent work after 2 hours, ♥♥♥♥ it.  I currently own a Logitech G27 and this game does not support it.  The steering wheel works fine, but the game does not support the H-shifter, for a game that claims to be a Real Driving Simulator this is pretty lame.  I tried everything to make it work and it still will not work, i know that my material isnt defective because it works on every single other racing games that i own.  If you don't mind playing with a controller i guess its fine but this is not for me.
5120	0	a	I want my money its sucks
5121	0	a	♥♥♥♥
5122	0	a	I am a big fan of racing games but this wasn't my favorite. I don't know why, but it did not feel very real for a simulator.
5123	0	a	If you ever consider buying Assetto Corsa just know that it is the buggiest game, that doesn't launch races and leaves you stuck in menus rendering it useless. You're better off donating the £34.99 to a charity instead.
5124	0	a	Best driving simulator out there - 10/10 Worst racing simulator I have played in the last 26 years (most frustrating AI in AI history) - 0/10
5125	0	a	Not nearly enough content  Edit:   Jesus Christ they just keep ♥♥♥♥ing adding dlc when the base product isnt even ♥♥♥♥ing finished. Do not buy this game they will jew you to death.
5126	0	a	This game is overrated.  Sounds are terrible, the exact same tyre screech regardless of car or speed or angle or whatever. The UI is made of 2 parts, like 2 separate programs - you set up what you want to play and then launch the race in a separate instance. This means you can't fix any settings on the second one, you keep needing to exit, reload etc. The cars look decent, but the tracks, trees, pitstop is very basic. The simulation is mostly decent, but it's very synthetic - the asphalt is perfecty smooth, tyres either grip or not, not very organic. And when you get off track the game adds the wobble many arcade games do - at least it doesn't do the complete slowdown when you touch grass. Car and track selection isn't very varied, There appears to be many dozen cars, but lost are slight variations of an other.
5127	0	a	cant say yet if game is good or bad but it took 9 hours to download and another 12 euro worth of GB wifi  iv a bran new steering wheel works fine on f1 but wont take a corner on this game cant get force feed back to work either so just a heads up if you think ur gonna jump straight in and drive you most likely are gonna spend hours just setting it up il add to this review if i ever get to ply it
5128	0	a	£35 it looks like a beta game and now doesnt load any tracks after spending hours configuring a controller. Dont bother
5129	0	a	Bad game. Waste of money. There is no simulation of this at all.
5130	0	a	This game needs a dynamic racing line and more cars and tracks that are not downloadable content, otherwise it simply can not compete with Project cars or Forza 5. All and all, a good game but not worth the thirty dollars I spent without the fore-mentioned additions. I would love to buy the Nurburgring Nordsliefe DLC, but it is simply not worth it without more of a game. Another case of pre-release being hyped. I would recommend this game for about fifteen dollars, and that's it.
5131	0	a	Force feedback feels feels wrong, physics are not really good.
5132	0	a	This is the singulary most obtuse starting menu I have ever had the displeasure of trying to start.  Buy the time you get the game working you are out of the mood to play.  Thrustmaster T500rs works VERY good everywhere else except in this frustrating piece of garbage.  When you are lucky and get to play after 2 hours of set up, the game is fantastic with very good ffb,  It just isnt worth the time to get there.
5133	0	a	it sucks, just dont buy it, thank me later
5134	0	a	crashes every time WTF
5135	0	a	DLC-simulator.  How do these devs justify putting out two barren DLC packs when the game itself is barren of content? They've padded the car selection with lotuses that are identical to eachother.  It needs more free cars, not more DLC.  I really can't recommend this game unless you get the base game + the DLC (two as of writing this review) for 15 bucks.
5136	0	a	Two words for this. Buy iRacing. I'd even go so far as demanding my money back for such a ♥♥♥♥ product
5137	0	a	It askes me for a Sever password when i have played on the sever before without using a server password. PLZ help
5138	0	a	This game has a ton of promise, but it's too barebones to be worth anything over $10. It comes with almost no cars, almost no tracks, and a TON of ads for things that you NEED TO BUY RIGHT NOW BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT!  The modding community is kind of garbage too. Everything has a billion horsepower, everything is a drift car, everything is a hillclimb, maybe 1 in 25 tracks have a working minimap. The best track as of yet is the C1 loop made famous by wangan midnight and tokyo xtreme racer, but it's in the day time, and with the weak selection of cars, there's not much point.  Things like that aren't really Kuno's fault, but shipping with around 10ish? cars? then releasing a TON is. If you bought this any time before V1.0, you got robbed. Don't avoid this game because it's good or bad, Avoid this game because of bad business practices. Kunos needs to learn that skalping is bad.
5139	0	a	May be it is a good game, if you can get Logitech G 920 wheel to work. I had to ask for refund Could not get it to work
5140	0	a	I bought it for VR as a replacement for Pcars... ohhh boy, worst decision in a long time. It's unplayable in VR, especially if you have a racing wheel. Simply because all the menues aren't visualized in VR. Not even badly... you have to take off the headset, select something, put the headset on again, take it off, navigate the menue, and so on... And the developer seems to refuse to patch this simple thing, but rathers push more car DLC's out. Unbelievable, half a year is gone and still nothing...
5141	0	a	Great if your happy battling against useless AI or hotlapping, online is a joke! More sim than most but still quite aracdey, cars can be saved too easily and have far too much grip. Looks nice.
5142	0	a	i just buy this like 2 hour ago after i start game  i try to understand how to play, i find a car that i want to play iwant to drive mazda rx-5/rx-7 so i have to buy dlc for that it ok i buy japan pack i got mazda BUT WHAT I DONT KNOW IS I CANT DO ANYTHING ON THIS CAR - NO CUSTOM AND WHEN I FIND A SERVER THERE ARE NO SERVER THAT ALLOW ME TO DRIVE MAZDA  VERY SHAME MONEY IS NOT PROBLEM FOR ME BUT IM SAD . I HAVE TO BUY DLC FOR A CAR THAT I CANT DO ANYTHING AND I CANT EVEN PLAY A CAR I BUY DLC FOR IT  37 MIN OF PLAYTIME I REQUEST A REFUND THIS GAME IS VERY BAD AND THIER DEVELOPMENT SHOULD HAVE SOME SHAME ALL I SEE A REVIEW ON YOUTUBE IS LIE  THIS GAME IS LIE   I WANT MY MONEY BACK THIS IS NOT A GOOD GAME FOR ME
5143	0	a	Unfinished product 40% finished.   If you're looking for a real sim look elsewhere, arcade at best, waste of money, -2/10
5144	0	a	Dont let the videos fool you. sucks...... needs lots of work. very few cars.
5145	0	a	This game seems to be always broken in some little annoying way. There is no polish and doesn’t feel like a complete product despite always needing to download updates.
5146	0	a	IMPOSSIBLE to drive a car. looks great cars handle like a bag of potatos - forcefeedback more like a forced slap in the face. i played forza GT6 and the likes and very much enjoyed them, downloaded AC and have just struggled to even control the cars using a logitech driving force pro, you expect grip from a race car you do not get that you just get a racing drift car.  £30 + £7 for the dlc pack 1 and what a letdown , i have more fun playing eurotruck sim and american truck sim at the very least feedback is not trying to rip your arms off. the haters will hate but speak to the wall becasue this hand aint listening.  career mode is impossible , the AI is way to strong even when dialed down to 80% ( yes thats it no lower) and even then one tiny mistake and your out , some of us are not pro drivers ( i do not own a real car or licence but i can drive) and to be honnest it does not feel like driving a car more like trying to wrestle a 15ft 350lb salt water crocodile.
5147	0	a	Worst game ever. It gives me freeze screen whenever i move mouse 1nm.
5148	0	a	Don't get it. It's still buggy and isn't worth purchasing right now!
5149	0	a	Game doesn't work and still should be in early access. waste of $55 ...
5150	0	a	Oh dear.....  Looked forward to this for a year, finally got it.... oh dear.  Maybe ive ben spoilt with R3E's sound and transmission/ engine/ tire model..... but Assetto Corsa has none of these.  The sound is terrible, cockpit and chase cam use the same sound???? There is no excitement changing through the gears like you get in R3E.  Again the sound plain sucks. I will note however, it is VERY WELL optimised, Im running it on a laptop in medium settings and it looks very very pretty..... sad thats all you get with this, lots of eye candy.  Drifting is good, i think they got the physics spot on there, but if you want to drive actual racing cars the physics are terrible. Gear changes are boring, there is no feeling of mechanical parts working together what so ever, i honestly get more excitement playing TOCA2 Touring cars on a PSX emulator than i did from this.....  Such a shame really looked forward to it  Summary.  sound sucks tires dont feel like there are on tarmac lovely visuals very good for road spec cars and good for messing around in them very very bad for stripped out racers  If you want real racing in real racing cars then R3E (RaceRoom Racing Experience) has this beat in every way by miles!  5/10
5151	0	a	the physics for this game with modern wheels is bad compared to other games out there. If you have a g27 its ok but newer wheels are not supported well. FFB feel really bad even after using LUX
5152	0	a	-cars feel like trucks to drive -constantly under steering  -car doesn't know when to stop steering -changing steering options doesn't help because then the car becomes even worse going round corners. -impossible to control any skidding/drifting. -most cars struggle to get out of 1st gear when going up a hill. -annoying external camera, shifting alongside the car when turning a corner. -1st person view not bad but the steering wheel is annoying because its impossible to adjust the steering sensitivity so the steering is actually good. -no reverse gears.  absolute disgrace of a driving game. ToCa Racedriver 3 is a better racing game than this.  Never trusting the Steam Community reviews again.
5153	0	a	This game is not Forza. I was lied to. L
5154	0	a	bad game for beginers, un-said but you need to be amazing at racing to get far and it helps to have a $100+ race controler too. if you don't have these then geting lucky is how you get far game is still to hard in my opion, in career there is no clear 'start' i still just guess when it really starts. once you mess up once there is no way to catch up so one bad turn and its time to reset the race.
5155	0	a	Cars dont handle good like in grid or Toca race driver 3 they have the cars driving like ♥♥♥♥ do not buy this game they need to fix it like Toca race driver 3 where u can pick slim or pro slim driving.
5156	0	a	ai just recentley bought Assetto corsa and its giving me this launch error anyone know how to help me thanks!
5157	0	a	Not only is this game not modding friendly it also limits the different ways you can set up a car. For most cars the tuning options are non existent. Changing gear ratios to suit the track? Forget about it. Different tyre compounds? Who needs it? More horsepower for the ring? Are you crazy?! /s This is weird because there is a save slot available for every track and car in the game. This also means u default to the standard setup every time you change track or car (this includes the POV setting).   I can't recommend this game because having arcade levels of tuning in a simulation game is unacceptable. 
5158	0	a	It's not a casual racer. So if that's your bag, I couldn't recommend this game to you.  On a brand spanking new machine made by the lord of PC gaming himself, this game looks FANTASTIC.  And if you like driving around doing time trials or just watching the world go by, it is excellent.  But if you're anything other than a hardcore sim racer, you're going to have a real hard time with the career mode. It starts off stupidly hard. And by about half-way through, even with settings set as easy as they go (which isn't far btw) you will struggle to keep up with the last placed car by the end of the 1st lap of any race.  + Looks fantastic. Buy it to impress your friends and family with that new PC of yours.  - Not so much a game, as a visual display of racing.
5159	0	a	Very nice racing sim, runs out of steam quickly though.
5160	0	a	Wow. This game feels like it's only 30% finished. AVOID. If you want a good racing game, get Project CARS.  The menus and UI don't even have controller support...
5161	0	a	♥♥♥♥♥♥ UI, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ in game redirects to pull money out of you, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ career, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ car.  Game is ♥♥♥♥♥♥.
5162	0	a	I really wish i could give a better review. i really do. It's a fun game, very realistic in SOME ASPECTS  Pros -  Great wheel optimization  Great physics  Great laser scanned tracks  Good graphics  CONS.  HORRIBLE clutch support  HORRIBLE sounds  Not many cars are H shifter compatible  Have to use flipping flappers to change gears, without the option to change to Hshifter  Compared to real MANUAL cars, this is horrible  I did enjoy this game a tiny bit, not enough for me to recommend or play anymore. Needs to update more. I've been backing since day 1. The Physics and wheel support are really good, just not the pedals.... or Hshifter support. AT ALL.   Did i mention the cars sound like toasters

5164	0	a	Doesn't work on my system. Requesting a refund as I am already at 53 minutes of play time all from troubleshooting. I can't get any type of race session to load. I am just taken back to the race settings menu. I clearly don't have enough time to mess with the settings and I don't care to. The game should just work really. But it doesn't and I want a refund, because I straight up don't have the time to fix your product. On top of that, this problem is a common problem. Alot of people seem to be getting it. So be warned. This is what you could be getting yourself into. You can't have anymore than 2hrs playtime to request a refund.  Looks like a good game though.
5165	0	a	Totally UNREALISTIC cornering; only loads and loads of understeer until you come out of the corner. So you better not buy this game until they fixed this...
5166	0	a	this game would be awsome if it worked.... when im done choozing mu cars and maps i click the race butten then it loads than goes back to the screen i need help!!!
5167	0	a	I was really excited to play this game using my G27 racing wheel, brand new high power windows gaming machine and oculus rift DK2.  First time I ran the game, the graphics were all messed up, the mountains were drawing over the track. It was a mess.  I noticed that the steering wheel was rotating way faster onscreen than the physical device. Considering this is the most popular driving wheel you'd expect that to be working out of the box.  Ok well no loss, maybe it will work better in the rift? No such luck. After following rather painful instructions on the forums, the game just crashes when you load up a race.  It might just be this version and things will be fixed soon, but I really cannot recommend this game right now if you are looking for a VR driving experience. My setup is not finge case so you would expect the developer be a bit more focused on providing the VR experience it is touted to have.  I would say hold on to your money until they fix the game.
5168	0	a	I listened to the community, saying 'It has realistic physics' And 'The physics are so great'.. So is that why grass behaves like ice? Why cars bounce uncontrollably when only hitting minor bumps? Why your car stops instantly when you grind a barrier? Why your car goes skidding for miles when you get bumped by someone else?  You can either listen to the troll community and buy this crap, or use £35 to buy project cars.   -Graphics are sh*t -Barely any content -Overpriced DLC which should have been in the game already -Laughable physics  But what can you expect from an indi game eh 
5169	0	a	Short and simple - the sims/simarcades that are out right now, are much better. Assetto offers weak car selection, decent physics, poor graphics, just plain bad audio quality, and a whole hell of a lot of DLC. Even with the DLC, the car selection is very low. Head over to the DLC section for this game to see what i mean. Cars the the R34 GTR, Mazda RX7, Mclaren P1, Porsche 918, you know, the basics for car lovers are DLC. Sure you can have your F1 cars, 458's and 12C's which have been the standard for 6 or so years, but any of the loveable 90's classics or the modern badass super/hypercars are pure DLC. So what, you pay $60&gt; for a good car selection for a game that at its core is weaker than old sims like GTR 2 and Rfactor? Cmon.
5170	0	a	Doesn't look merely as good as the rendered screens. Bad physics, feels like driving a floating carpet. I'd buy an Xbox One solely for Forza5 rather than playing this torture.
5171	0	a	this ♥♥♥♥ feels like it's still in ♥♥♥♥ing beta.  hosting a multiplayer game takes an external DOS executable and configurations to be made via editing a cfg file. what is this, 1993? it's also barren. not a lot of content. not to mention fugly as hell, but that's a minor complaint.   anyway, get automobilista instead. if stock car extreme is anything to go by, it's probably a better buy.
5172	0	a	Buyer beware, avoid this like the plague. Biggest pile of steaming horse manure I've witnessed.  False advertising, Misleading claims  -Claims to be a Sim but in reality its a glorified keyboard/pad racer habited by arcade racer fanboys who have ego issues. eg : ' SeriousSpy 1 hour ago You're right, TDU2 is so much more realistic.' - Keep them coming guys.  -Claims to have G27 support but ♥♥♥♥, the FFB model is as shithouse, tweak it all you want theres one fixed ffb curve and a few sliders, forget the silly ffb plugin toys, just fluff that doesn't contribute towards addressing actual issues.  -Toxic Community :   Originally posted by   mr munkee  :
5173	0	a	Call it a sandbox, call it a masterpiece, call it simulation, but it's still a Game, that should be made for fun. This one gets  boring , maybe too serious, you have to repeat a path over and over until ... you miss by 0.1 sec..  Really?  No  open world map? Hats off devs  24/100
5174	0	a	Don't buy this unless you're wanting to spend hours trying to figure out how to play with someone you know.
5175	0	a	Feels like an ice skating simulator if you try using an Xbox 360 controller.   DLC for a game that felt like Early Access is lame too.
5176	0	a	Buggy game. Actually very bad!
5177	0	a	Multiplayer is garbo, DLC / Updates are lacking, and little to no support for VR.  
5178	0	a	The developers have stated directly that they aren't interested in VR for Assetto Corsa, and that was the whole reason I bought this game. They can do whatever they wish of course, but I can not reccomend this game if they are going to ignore the die-hard sim people, especially for something as excellent as VR.
5179	0	a	This game is just fail. Physics is nice but lack of cars and tracks makes it boring very fast. Wish I bought project CARS instead...
5180	0	a	I dunno if im playing a different game to everyone else but this is awful, bad physics, terrible ai, graphics that wouldnt look out of place on a ps2, barely any cars or tracks, most mods dont even work properly, terrible sound effects, complicated menus,glitches galore and its extreamly boring i was expecting much more with such good reviews.
5181	0	a	No HTC vive support ....... prefer money over anything else ...... so you have low content with teh game and need to pay tons of DLC to add few content .....   ban without good reason people and post on the forum (not me). ..   and this is the racing game with the worst sound design i ever try !!!!!!!  RRRE for example have a good sound design  run away
5182	0	a	cant use my wheel
5183	0	a	Does not play in windows 10. Wasted my money
5184	0	a	Dissapointing handling, could do better.
5185	0	a	Looks and plays nothing like advertised. Textures are bad, AA non-existent, sound quality poor, and the UI is a mess. The fact that the game relies on filters to make the game look pretty is shocking. This should of stayed in Early Access where it belongs.  Played on an i7 4770k @3.5Ghz with a GTX 780.  I'm happy that Steam have refunded me full credit. You have been warned!
5186	0	a	When I first experiense this, It was an Early acces.   1 Month later it was call a full game and you have to pay for every update. EVERY. UPDATE.  Yes it is F*******g good and realistic.   Am I going to continu supporting this fashion of ''let call this game done and charge for every content we originaly plan to put in'' ? Absolutly Not.
5187	0	a	this game will make you feel cheated from time to time in certain races. Some cars DO NOT handle as a car should when turning a corner at 20mph... why is a bmw slipping so much at that speed. graphics are getting dated.. the only enjoyable races are with the faster cars. It's NOT the most realistic racing game out. 
5188	0	a	I know I am going to get flak for this but I will say this, it is still a really good game hell one of the best racing sims on steam.   Pros: -Sound (oh god the engine sounds :)) -Optimization -Graphics - All the cars drive uniquely  Cons: -Crash physics is eh compared to other AAA games (improving though) -THE BUSINESS MODEL  I am sorry to say even though I love this game, I cannot reccomend it solely on the fact that the devs (or publishers) thought is was a good idea to sell DLC for an early access game. Now if the game was 20-30$ normal price this could be bareable, but it's base price 50 FREAKING DOLLARS. Now if you add the DLCs DP1 and DP2 this game is a whopping 75$, which is MORE THAN A AAA GAME (Forza, Project Cars, Gran Turismo). Bare in mind that right now even with all the DLCs the there are only 60 cars and 18 tracks.  So sorry I really don't see why I have to pay for DLC in an early access game that is 50$ base price (maybe 30$ for sales) where not some but all of the content is added later on for free.
5189	0	a	This game isn't fun. I spend the rest of my Christmas money on this game and it doesn't even work with my wheel, which is a Logitech Driving Force. I have seen several people use this wheel for this game and it work perfectly fine. I assigned the throttle for throttle and the brake for brake and the brake ended up being the throttle and the throttle pedal was the brake. What the heck! The game is super laggy even though I am playing on a 2 year old computer. I tryed to adjust graphic settings and nothing helped. Super big disappointment. I had high expectations for this game and it doesnt work. I want a refund. I will try this game again if the developers fix these ridiculous problems. MAKE IT RIGHT THE FIRST TIME!
5190	0	a	i dont know if its so realistic or physics are wrong, u can barely go into a corner 50 kmh, these are sports cars  beside the f1 car its very hard to go into a corner also the steering wheel always shift lil bit to the left, dnt have this issue with any other car games  list of cars is very short
5191	0	a	This has very limited (only few) cars and few tracks, you have to buy everything, when you click none of them works. i made a mistake buying this.

5194	0	a	dont buy this game. it's good for hotlapping but the devs couldn't give less of a stink about multiplayer or the community in general. if you must, wait for a sale.
5195	0	a	This game is so Bad,cant belive i payed for this crap.
5196	0	a	i was not very impressed.. its no good unless you#ve go a steering wheel. and there are way too few cars and tracks. also i tried some custom key binding and saved it so, but it did not function properly.   but the graphics and style of the game was cool and an interessting idea.
5197	0	a	A less than desirable rate of release on updates compared to what was expected and comapared to current market competitiors.   Also the updates you have change menial stuff to do with the single player or adding more cars so the multiplayer functionality is still hideously limited. Also the fact AC is on steam means when MP does work long enough to complete a race you get smashed off in turn one by some moron keyboard jockey.   AC looks pretty and runs well. The cars feel off and the tracks are laser scanned in the very loosest sense of the word.   If you want a serious sim to race in go to iRacing or rFactor 2. If you just want to muck around with some morons on a (just about) working multiplayer then get AC... but on offer because £30 for what you get now is laughable.
5198	0	a	Sorry guys, but from the looks of all the reviews that I've seen of the game, and after playing it myself, they don't match up at all. I felt strongly enough about this game to post a review, which I practically never do.  This is not Gran Turismo. This is more like Live for Speed, and an unfinished one at that. Car sounds (The Fiat 500 Abarth that I tried) are tinny Xbox 360 controller steering is cartoonish at best (very digital. Turn right, it's immediate right, no give, no play on the steering rack, just immediate right.) No menu music No atmosphere The main game switches from an almost website-like feeling menu system where you go through the career and choose your track / objective etc, and does a distinct directx window switch into 'the game', which is even a seperate executable (acs.exe). No game does this any more; and if they do, they hide it with menu music or similar. The AI are unrealistically impossible. They make no mistakes, they follow the perfect line at the perfect speed and it's impossible to catch them if you make a single mistake. There is no track directional audio, no pit-side audio telling you where everyone else is on the track, how well or bad you're doing. No mid-lap time notifications to tell you how far behind or ahead you are compared to the next car.   Am I asking for a lot? Yes. Is it unreasonable? No.
5199	0	a	This game has the worse AI I've ever played against. They just sit on the racing line and won't give you space when you try an overtake even though you're half a car length ahead. Completely brain-dead AI Go buy rFactor 1 and/or 2 instead
5200	0	a	Good game let down by poor graphics.   In short: AC's graphics look dated compared to many other modern driving games out there, especially when you pay attention to details. AC's cars themselves look very good but that's it. All the (laser scanned) tracks in AC look very sterile and dead. Just compare the graphics and the livelyness on and around the tracks to games like Dirt Rally, Project Cars, F1 2016 etc. and you will clearly notice it.  There is hardly any movement on and around AC's tracks (the static trees and bushes are completely motionless, no wind effects, no leafs, grass, birds, planes, floating or flying in the air, no animated effects next to the tracks, etc.) and the spectators are some of the worst looking you will ever see in any game: they are just paper thin static cardboard figures! AC's ambient sounds are lacking as well.   There is no way around it, AC looks dated, no matter how many more car packs they will release for it! What's the use in getting them? You'll still be driving around in a very sterile and dead looking environment. It's almost just a hotlap simulator while it could be so much more!  As long as they don't improve AC's graphics I will not play it anymore, which is a shame because I own all DLCs for it,  excluding  the recent Porsche packs because that's when I lost interest in playing AC because of the sterile and dated graphics and the lack of graphical improvements. What's more, I have completely uninstalled the game at the moment because of this.  I wish AC would take note of what other driving games are doing in this area: Dirt Rally, Project Cars, Raceroom, GRID Autosport, F1 2016 etc. all these games have much better graphics, more lively tracks, animated 3D spectators and better ambient sounds and are way more fun to play and much more immersive.  The excuse of 'AC is a sim, it's focused on physics' (and therefore it's okay to look like crap) is just very poor, it's 2016, it's okay to expect and ask for more! Yes, AC has excellent physics, however good physics alone is not enough, I expect and want more. A perfect example of this is Dirt Rally: it has become more or less the de facto standard of rally sim racing and it has great physics, beautiful graphics, solid damage model, different weather conditions, day and night tracks and plenty of atmosphere and immersion, proof enough that the really great games get it right on all fronts.  Thusfar I have not even mentioned a dynamic day and night cycle, weather system or (visual) damage system yet. But you guessed it: these are all absent in AC and there are no night races either: the headlights don't even emit light on the tracks when it's dark. steambored  Just imagine AC and its excellent physics with the beautiful graphics of Dirt Rally/Project Cars and the fantastic audio of RaceRoom Racing Experience: then it could become the best driving simulator ever!
5201	0	a	I came back to this game after putting it down for a while when it was on early access. Picked it back up again after they added carer mode, then put it back down again due to the over the top dificulty level. I have completed precicely one time attack, that's it. You have to be a god dam pro racing driver to be able to complete anything on this game.
5202	0	a	Career mode seemed to be incredibly limited. No feeling of accomplishment or advancement at all. Dated graphics looked more akin to a late PS2 title than a recent PC title. AI was terrible. Vehicle physics felt like every other recent racing title.  Overall this game does not feel anywhere close to being finished, let alone justifying DLC already.
5203	0	a	Nice sounds and nice graphics, if you like cars because of the looks or sound..Great this game is for you. If u want a great all-rounded racing game, look else where, in short; This is a Dad game.
5204	0	a	The game won't even go past the initial load screen for me. When you go to the support forums they have a huge checklist of items you are supposed to complete before posting your issue. I got through some of them like the typical 'cache integrity check', deleting the folders in My Documents. Then there are a list of things they want you to reinstall, like DirectX, Visual C++ redistributables, .NET frameworks.  Too much work when every other game I have on Steam 'just works'. I've had issues in the past with games that get glitchy and you have to update your graphics drivers, or disable a certain setting, or even the cache integrity/reinstall option. But this is just too much work when I just want to play the game. I'm not building my own Arch Linux machine here.
5205	0	a	Fantastic program with OK graphics and extremely poor synthesised sounds which ruins the game grately. You address a few of the issues with modding but would have been nice to have basic things out of the box.  Simulation is 8/10 (Force feedback is great) Graphics 6/10 (pretty much 4 years old engine) Sounds 3/10   Modding 10/10  Overall 7/10: good but could have been way better  
5206	0	a	I would not recommend this game due to the lack of controller support, unless you like driving with triggers its right up your ally!  Game uses that same progressive driving for these types of games you can't play what you want to play till you play all the other disciplines. Plus not getting any feed back from the developers is another common issue with this game. Been with them since early access and wrote to them that they needed to have the ablity to change the xbox gamepad controls and never did add that feature to change throttle controls. Players will gun you down if you mention anything of the sort.  Never got a chance to play multiplayer because of disconnection issues or either very bad lag, but happy to you if your able to play online. Plus I would ignore these paid to review companies as they always sway towards certian games.  Plus game still feels unfinished since last time I played and never had any fun because I was fighting the controls the whole time I was playing.  So if you don't mind using a wheel, this game is for you. But if you want 'Your Racing Sim' well thats not going to happen. I just wasted money on this game and thought it was going to be fantastic ended up being a controller nightmare.  so in conclusion: If you play with wheel = good! If you don't = tough luck! I recommend you check out Project CARS, more content than this game from day 1.

5208	0	a	Would buy again 9.1/10 Best game of the year  PSYCHE   Bought this game in Early Access. I thought I would wait until they added better cars, since thier variety was really limited. Waited, then DLC came out with cars that should be in the normal full version. This is not acceptable. I rarely spend 50$ on a game, and I saw that this game has potential. Also, graphics don't really push my system and are not the greatest. Also, my fps gets capped at 30fps when I turn at corners, causing lag and stutters. With all this aside, I truly believe this is one of the best simulators out there.  Conclusion:  Wish the car choices were better at start, because no one likes DLC, and fps related issues were fixed. Would play this game more if there was more then 3 cars I liked.
5209	0	a	Should have done a bit more research into the game: was hoping it was going to be kind of a 'collect-a-car' type of racer, like Gran Turismo. After switching to PC I was looking to find such a game. This game is amazingly beautiful, but the driving isn't what I was hoping. All in all, not a game I really enjoyed playing all that much.

But, there is almost always an issue getting this game to run properly after updates for PC and I've tried all the usual fixes for 4 hrs today. i'm done...not worth the trouble. Was fine 3 months ago ; with updated graphic drivers I still get no farther than the menus. The old 'start button' issue. Guess that's why most folks go console these days---less complicated, same hardware.

I have to say this was the biggest mistake of all my life. What a shame. Most peopple on steam write negative comments about project cars how ♥♥♥♥♥ game that is and how good assetto corsa is. You know what peopple, you don't even know what you are saying. Project cars is far better than this poo and more realistic, etc. This asseto game is crap. what a shame, I couldnt play it for more than 10 minutes.

Absolutely no reason to buy this game compared to other racing titles.  And for all the people who follow this game like a cult try playing project cars it blows this ♥♥♥♥ out of the water. It has a better menu layout, far greater capability of cars, infinitely more cars and tracks to drive and the audio and visuals are actually up to date with it's release date. Assetto Corsa seriously looks and feels like an unfinished project, not a complete game that sells for full price and has DLC

5245	0	a	It's missing some of the most basic features that others have had for over 10 years, Kunos is constantly messing with it, the physics are dreadful, the AI is still too stupid to have a decent race with, the sounds are terrible and require mods to make it sound good, some of the cars are copy pasta (for example, the Mercedes AMG GT3 is just the SLS AMG GT3 underneath), and it has very little base content which requires mods to make it feel like it has some substance to it.  On top of that, Stefano Casillo and teh people who work for him have zero ability to take any kind of criticism, construcive or not, and the fanboys who defend all this crap are some of the most idiotic people I've ever seen.  It's billed as 'Your Driving Simulator', but it sure as hell isn't mine. At least the first 3 letters of the title let you know what this game is.  AC has good graphics though.

5250	0	a	Pretty game, but physics suck for the casual gamer coming from consol, im sure they work great if you have a steering wheel setup, but that not how i enjoy racing games. DO NOT BUY!
5251	0	a	I am a new comer to racing games, but compared to Project Cars, this game is not very good.
5252	0	a	This simulator has excellent graphics, good force feedback and excellent settings for triple screen I have ever seen. Unfortunately I am still not willing to dedicate myself (and not recommend it now) on it as it feels and behaves as an eternal 'beta'. It is taking too long to really feel as a finished and developed simulator. Although improving tire physics, there is no change in time, no night races, no rain, few selection of tracks. AI behaves only on pre defined 'official' tracks and it is a disaster on any mod installed. Door to door contacts and crashes are still poor.  It is far from Rfactor in terms of online races, accidents and bumping controls, replay, broadcasting tools, AI behavior and mods acceptance. Automobilista is developing really fast and I believe it will take over Asseto as things are going on so far. Other simulators just need to evolve to a newest directX in order to improve graphics and beat Asseto.
5253	0	a	Technical difficulties review: Game would load, but can't get to race/ events aka driving. It just says loading and returns back to event selection. I had to ask refund.  Edit: And yes. The resolution was correct.

5267	0	a	On the surface everything about AC sounds great. Nice looking DX11 graphics, amazing dream cars. However when you spend enough time with the game and get past the initial gloss the cracks start to appear.  When it comes to the content of the game this area is seriously lacking, there are very few tracks and cars. Also it is strange why the Dev’s decided to bulk the game up with filler cars like having multiple lotus elises/exiges and BMW's. I find as well that the street cars in the game are just not very fun to drive and a bit pointless. DLC is a gripe for me as it just gets very tiring that game developers will not include enough content in the first instant and then make you pay for more. For me it somewhat represents a gaming existential crisis. I keep asking myself why do I keep putting more money into something that I don’t get enough out of and why am I supporting this financially, when logically I should just walk away from it. The cost of the DLC alone means I could just go buy another sim instead.   AI is akin to driving against basic drones that follow a line, they have no real life to them at all. This is a massive blow to this game, As it becomes not worth racing the AI. Which then leads you to just hotlaping all the time. This takes away a very core element of a sim racing game being a big source of the fun.  Car physics which compared to rfactor 2 are lacking quite a bit. In rfactor 2 the tyre model overall physics are amazing. AC does not come close to rfactor 2 in this regard.  Sounds have improved but are still lack lustre. When you have low quality sounds it takes away a lot of the immersion.  Something I have noticed and other people may have as well is that the scale of the cars and tracks seem to be quite small, which I find weird.   In summary I feel like this game simply has no soul to it. It just has an allure of flash but as the old cliché goes no substance. If you are a hardcore sim racing person who values more the racing experience rather than having dream cars to drive, I would recommend you avoid the game and go for rfactor 2 instead which has loads of free content and is much more of a true to life racing experience and is a lot more fun.

5270	0	a	This game is a perfect racing simulator. Good car mechanics, good graphics, good everything. BUT! I think that those developpers are so money oriented that they dare to make not 1, not 2, BUT 3 bloody PORSCHE DLCs. You want a 911 and a Cayman spyder? Well you have to buy two seperate f***** DLCs.   /*/*/*Edit1: I can give it a negative review because of their dlc pricing policy. Since the number of cars in the original version is not much(!)  No laguna seca, no hockenheim ring, no brno circuit, no magny-cours, no circuit paul ricard, no suzuka and so on. This game lacks content. But the physics, mechanics, graphics are great. Renault: no check Dodge: no check Volkswagen: no check That f***** Maserati SUV: check omg such car, much italian, very new.  /*/*/*Edit2: Okay, so if PORSCHE is notorious for their pricing thing, maybe they could add more other brands than PORSCHE, like the examples above. And this still doesn't certify their 3DLC policy. They're not kind with their DLC pricing policy, that's all what I'm trying to say.   /*/*/*PS: I WILL RECOMMEND this game once the amount of content is adequate (tracks, cars)

To put this into context, Automobilista has a similarly lacking interface but it is worth it due to the driving experience and AI. If you want better driving, try Automobilista, iRacing, rFactor or even Project Cars.

But then I went through and had to set up all the controls for my Thrustmaster T150 Racing wheel which was a pain. But I was still excited until I started a event... The HUD layout is very... outdated looking. Graphics are poor. But that is nothing until you find out that the price of the DLC's are more than the game its self. I bought the game with all the Dream car packs dlcs included. I was suprised when I saw how little cars there were. So I will stick to Project cars  BUT if you are the type of person who likes ok graphics,mediocre force feedback, controls that are hard to setup, and dlcs that will make you go bankrupt then this game is for you!

5285	0	a	well... I tried to find something good in this game comparing to iracing, rFactor, f1 2016 and project cars and i literally failed.  -graphics (on my taste even iRacing have better graphics) -damage model (hit the wall on 300 kmph and yeah ull get a scratch on ur bumper) -interface (its like the ♥♥♥♥♥iest i ever experienced) -Singleplaer Career (what? I need to get enough points to switch to another 'series'? Lol ok. worst campaign ever) -suspension work  +- Physics are ok. Sometimes weird sometimes bad sometimes good. Bad when it comes to bumps and suspension work good when it comes to slides. FFB helps to feel it but i had MUCH BETTER FFB experience in iRacing FULL MONZA Course for example)  + yeah its cheap. U dont have to pay subscription fee as in iRacing but u still have DLC's to buy. + tracks looks legit  overally i would give 6.5/10. When 10 is unreachable at the corrent state of racing sims 8 is a stronk sims like iracing and 4 is a good arcades.  History: i bought this game once and requested refund. Then i decided to give it another try and i really did but still i dont like it and probably wont play it much  
5286	0	a	It's a great simulation of a grey screen because you can't get past the menu  --- update ---  Got the game working but kind of wish I hadn't. There is no sensation of speed, cars are pre-selected for you in career races, it's boring to play, I'm relieved I got it in the sale and didn't pay full price.  Might give it another go if they finish the game off.

5298	0	a	Not much to this one. Nearly all the cars are just sports cars you can go out and buy and drive in real life if you want to, I'd like to see a lot more cars that aren't just street cars that are available to buy, and be able to drive some real racing cars that are not able to be bought on the open market. The idea is to be able to drive a car that you couldn't drive in real life, not just drive the same cars in a game you drive in real life, that's just boring.  Graphics are sub par for a modern racing game, the tracks are basically without any texture at all and the cars don't have the details and sharpness of other games in this genre.  I'll wait until the graphics, physics and cars are worth playing and try again.  I wonder when or if the AC team will give the organic shapes some love. The trees and natural features in the game look like old 8 bit crap from days gone by, please do some engine modding to get this fixed, it ruins the realism.

5302	0	a	I'm just not enjoying this game.   I guess it's because I like arcade racers rather than simulators.   The main thing that is ruining this game for me is the menus. They are so frustrating. They are hard to read, not really obvious what each button does and no clue as to what they are by hovering your mouse over them either. I am sure you will get used to them after time but it's little touches like that which are missing. The game just doesn't flow very well and it's the menus that cause this.   The career mode is a bit boring and I just don't feel like I'm having an exciting race.   There is just something missing from the game that makes it less enjoyable than it should. Yes it looks great but the playability and user friendliness is missing.  If you like simulators and enjoy looking and driving around in different kind of cars then this is a good game for that. If you are looking for high action arcade racing with intuitive menus and a great career mode then I would look elsewhere.   I wish I had spent my money on a different kind of racing game now.

5305	0	a	I feel like i wasted my money buying this game, i saw such good reviews, saying the handeling was good, so i bought it and i was seriously disappointed, the steering felt so stiff, in a BMW M3, you go 30MPH (it looks about 5MPH) and you start to turn, and the wheels start screeching, and you arent doing anything, in the pagani huyara the steering feels so stiff, i breaked down to 15MPH and start to turn and its stupid, nothing happens you just go off the track, even though you are going slow enough that it feels like you should corner no problem, wasnt for me, which i could return it.

5308	0	a	Holding a $45 USD Price, this game is utterly dissapointing. I gave it a fair chance but it failed me and the hype it had built. This game is definitaly not worth the hefty price tag and is a complete waste of money. It has performance issues and UI issues. It's campaign is slow starting and boring. Non of its good reviews lived up to it's claims and match each and every bad review on this game. For a simulator its probably one of the worst; High price tag, good reviews, good previews, but when it comes to playing its complete garbage. I spent 10 hours downloading, Spent $45! USD which is $58.95 AUD and that is ridicoulus. Sure if i didnt like it why did i spend over 2 hours playing? That's because 2 hours isnt enough time to completely make up your mind for a hardcore gamer like me. Such thing enrages me and I'm not a happy camper.

5315	0	a	I wanted to love Assetto Corsa, I really did. After spending most of my Steam wallet on this I started playing. For a simulator the game feels 'cheap'. Graphics are horrible compared to most other racing games (I know that graphics don't sell a game, but it doesn't do this game any favours), sounds are weak (not as bad as Gran Turismo, but close), menus/UI are clunky and unintuitive. One good thing is that the driving physics feel responsive and grippy. The game feels like some sort of steam greenlight release never to see it past alpha, but the price tag says 'super serious simulator guys'. I don't recommend it, but if you want a sim racer you might want to check it out.

Also does not scale, if I lower settings to 1920x1080, or whatever the 1280x720 or any other dimension, it just uses a smaller portion of my screen.
5322	0	a	The driving is really bad if you don't have a wheel, and the graphics suck too, this looks nothing like the videos. I cranked my graphics as high as they would go and was still always getting well over 100 fps and the game looked Bad. It's impossible to drive well with mouse and keyboard on this game I do not recommend it.

5328	0	a	Okay, it's a simulation. Wow, great, so you can only play it with a steering wheel, not a chance with a gamepad (well maybe with all the driving aids on, but there's no simulation in that). There's a very, VERY limited choice of cars, if you want more, you need to buy all the DLCs, but you will still only get different skins for cars you already had. Does it even have good graphics? No. I mean I saw some pretty decent 'ingame' screenshots, but what I'm getting while playing is far from that. Nothing better than MEDIOCRE. Sounds? Pathetic, there's not a single car that sounds even remotely like a real one, engine sounds at low rpm remind me of games I played 20 years ago. Sorry, I had more fun playing GRID Autosport, which might not be a simulation game, but the car choice is better, it's perfectly playable on a gamepad (even DiRT Rally is, and it has a better driving model than AC) and when you crash, you can actually see it on the car. And when talking about dirt rally - that game can be really challenging when playing on gamepad, but you still enjoy it. That doesn't apply in this case.  EDIT: you can get other cars and tracks as mods, of course, but the range of cars included with the game is just too narrow.

5334	0	a	Not even close to being worth the price it's sold at. I wouldn't have gotten my money's worth if it cost $20. Limited car list, no vehicle personalization, tuning is miserable, very limited track choice, interface is an atrocity, graphics extremely poor compared to competition. Only upside is the C7R exhaust note. Which is part of a $15(!!!!!!!!) DLC. Save the money, buy NFS Shift and call it a day.
5335	0	a	The reason I bought this game is because I heard it was similar to Project Cars. They are often compared and sometimes PC comes out as a winner, sometimes AC. So I decided to give Assetto Corsa a shot after having played Project Cars.  Now I am really dissapointed.  The game just seems amateuristic, menus aren't nice, no controller support in the menus, there's no background music and the graphics (unlike what some people may think) are not good in my opinion. At least not good compared to Project cars. The car models are good, but the environments look really dated, and even with the highest AA settings, there are still quite some jaggies. Also the lighting is better in PC in my opinion.  I did quit the game after 2 races, so maybe I should have given it a little more time, but the races, the career, it all seems so bland and uninteresting.   The gameplay, physics, etc. may be good, but these things really bother me. It looks and feels like an early access racing game from a small, new developer.   Maybe I'm just too spoiled with Project Cars.

As raw as it can be, cars don't turn (I have to go around 60 kilometers slower than the same car on Project Cars) and if they turn, it's because they oversteer like crazy, AKA you are going to spin out. Honestly, I probably need a tutorial JUST for this game, but WTF - going STRAIGHT is not an option?

Dissappointed with the adapted Vive experience of these two sims, I bought pCars yesterday with native Vive support. Purely with the Vive mind, I was totally surprised by pCars. It feels and plays great in VR. AC and others should be ashamed of themselves for siding with Rift. Great job, pCars! You gave me my best VR sim driving experience on my Vive. If you're like me looking for the best VR racing sim on the Vive, I do not recommend AC.

5357	0	a	I dont like this game  i give you 1 reasson why  i expected to be a game like grid autosport or other race games  but i was wrong and this is a simulator where you can change everything what you want.   This is not something for people who play grid autosport or other race games. This game is very advanced and very different what you expected.   Still, maybe im gonna try this game a few months later but for now i stick with other games like grid and nfs.  but this is for me, if you like simulators, like grand turismo, then this game is a must have. For me its not a must have at the moment.
5358	0	a	How can a racing sim be so nearly good yet so far off because of a very poor, unintuitive user interface, ridiculously over the top visual effects and some very basic things missing in car handling? It seems to me that Kunos is somehow trying to compete with the visuals of Project Cars but the result is a complete mess of over-the-top lighting which on any setting makes the sky look blindingly bright but most of the interior of cars so dark you simply cannot see the needles or gauges.  The contrast is so high that with almost any manual exposure setting the track (from the cockpit) is unclear, especially with the sun glaring at you and the other cars look so dark the only way to see them clearly is to up the exposure so everything else is literally blinding. Even with post processing off it is still way too contrasted, and cutting down your monitor contrast so the whole screen is a bland, washed out mess hardly helps. This attempt to make the sim look more appealing has backfired badly. There are some post process mods which slightly improve things but the fundamental flaw is still there.  Controls ----------  The Force Feedback is potentially good but the general wheel/control adjustments are poorly explained and poorly implemented. For example, just a tiny increment in speed sensitivity grossly restricts the steering movement unless you are going very slowly, which means there is not enough lock to catch a slide. On the other hand if you switch speed sensitivity off you can barely turn the wheel in a fast, straight section because the steering then becomes too sensitive. When I say the speed sensitivity control is too coarse, you have to understand that a miniscule 0.02 increase in speed sensitivity makes the steering impossible to get full lock unless you are so slow that it cannot possibly catch a slide.  Understeer ---------------  Some cars are decently designed with reasonably convincing balance, but many of the default cars (Lotus Elise) have terminal understeer. In fact I could not even get the tail out in 2nd gear on full lock with full throttle! Yet the Elise is notorious as a tail happy car.  Other cars - particularly the Lotus 25 in Dreampack 3 - have an inexplicable and quite unrealistic tendency to wander while going dead straight. This interpretation is something cooked up but it is not accurate at all. In fact single seat cars of this era were, and are, not unstable in a straight line and the assumption that they are is a complete myth. Other basic flaws with the Lotus 25 is that the 'auto-blip' to match revs to a gear change-down is insufficient so changing down results in the rear wheels locking and the car spinning. Why have an 'auto-blip' if it does not work? The Lotus 49 also demonstrates an inexplicable tendency to wander while in a straight line.  Sounds ----------  These are mostly good and in some cases, very good. However some cars have poorly implemented transition between power on and power off. You can hear the 'join'. See GT Legends for absolutely brilliant sound design.  Shadows -----------  AC has the worst shadowing in any sim I have seen. Just to indicate how bad it is, GT Legends, a decade old title, has much better shading and much better shadows, and at maximum detail hardly impacts on frame rates and stability. The shadows in AC are a horrible collection of annoying and disturbing, over-contrasted, jagged, swimming and shimmering blobs of darkness. They, and the reflections, when turned up to a half-decent level, ruin frame rates and impact badly on computer performance. I recommend using the frame rate restrictor unless you have a stella computer system. I lock mine at 50 fps and this improves the stuttering which is evident particularly at Brands Hatch (Dreampack 3).  AI ---  I'm told the ai has somewhat improved with Version 1.5. Well, in that case I wonder what it was like in earlier versions. The AI cars regularly wander way off the track yet carry on as though they were being driven perfectly.  Good parts ------------  It's not all bad. Some of the cars are well presented and drive reasonably well. When the FF is adjusted it can be quite convincing. This, and the ai, still does not approach the quality of rFactor 2 and rFactor 1. There is great potential here for a sim to be a pleasure to drive and there are many qualities which with sensible presentation (The dire UI needs an overhaul) and concentrating on the driving experience rather than things like over-the-top lighting effects does reep rewards.  The tracks that are included are quite well done, but there are too few of them for a full priced release. Missing out of the box are some classic tracks which should have been included, although so far the DLC is at least reasonably priced.  Maybe this sim will improve further. It could be so good if Kunos looked at the basic flaws and stopped trying to make AC compete with Pcars. I fear that might not happen however, at is looks as though recent updates are preparing this sim for arcade use with xbox etc. That would be a pity as AC has the potential to be a great simulator, and already the modding support hugely surpasses that for rFactor 2.  I'd be happy to recommend this title if Kunos pay more attention to the fundamentals of making a good racing sim which at the moment are trumped by a seeming obsession with grossly impractical lighting, poor shadowing and unnecessary bling at the expense of a convincing driving experience.

5363	0	a	No HTC Vive support. Got my HTC Vive and G27 sitting here, can't make use of it.  There may be many positive things about this game, but for me personally, no proper VR support kills the game and I thus do not recommend this game to anyone else who has the HTC Vive.
5364	0	a	good racing game... a RWD having bad understeer and a AWD behaving like a RWD with a very lively rear end.  My only point of reference is my driving experience and my years of playing Grand Turismo. By that view I would say the simulation isn't quite on point with that I was expecting and as such, I cannot recommend it as a Racing Sim.
5365	0	a	In short - if you want a game which is realistic in almost every regard, this is for you. If you want a 'racing game' you will be disappointed, as it's truly awful for the casual user.   There's no denying that this game looks amazing. Running at maximum resolution and detail the cars look absolutely stunning and with some screenshots you'd be hard pushed to decide whether it was the real thing under some artsy camera filter.  I am a huge car fan, and after getting a taste for it in NFSU2 more than a decade ago, I've been searching for a game where it was possible to customise your car. Modify, upgrade and tweak and then test the difference on the track. This game allows you to adjust practically any feature of your car you could in real life, and the descriptions of what you're altering (camber, return rates etc) will be handy for anyone who's not as into cars.  However it falls into the same trap that all 'technically correct' racing games do. They forget that when you're driving a car through a pad, or through a keyboard there is no feel. You can't feel the back end slipping, the suspension doing it's job or any number of other cues that you'd get driving in real life. This game tries to faithfully recreate real life handling, but seems to forget in doing so that it's supposed to be a game. I don't want complete clown, cartoon handling but at the same time I don't want to learn to drive over again except this time without the aid of any feedback from the vehicle and based on what some programmer thinks physics is like. It's simply not enjoyable - I haven't got hours upon hours to practice getting a feel for it. I just wanted some a game with excellent graphics and lots of cars to play around with - not someone's attempt at creating the worlds most beautiful, technically accurate but fundamentally dull physics simulator.   
5366	0	a	Pros  amazing support for wheel and all accessories inc 3 pedals and shifter. looks good career seem big  Cons A.I is hard A.I is better than you A.I cant be turned down unless using file manipulation  i played this game for an hour. setting up wheel, gear shifter and pedals took 10 mins. i spent a bit of time in time trial getting use to the cars. i bought the dlc just to get my fave car The AE86. Once i'd done in time trial i moved over to career and thats where everything fell to ♥♥♥♥.   The A.I is amazing. I cant keep up i did 3 races coming 8th twice and quit once i got lapped in the last one. With no way to turn A.I down a few pegs to make it fun i gave up.   
5367	0	a	This game honestly feels like it should still be in early access. Vehicle models are nice but sounds are messed up. Plays absolutely horrible on a controller (plays kinda ok but who have to spend waaay too much time finding what works) if you don't feel like hooking up a wheel (making it pretty much necessary). Lack of music really makes the game seem stale. Car roster is very limited same with the tracks. Overall i would say buying this on sale of less than 60% is a waste of your money. I'm going back to Gran Turismo.

5370	0	a	When Forza Apex gets wheel support on pc this game will be obsolete. Low detail tracks (even after they improved them), screenshots look better than the game itself, many car variants are just copy-paste so not many cars overall, no fun in career mode, the game is just a big practice mode without real racing feeling.  If you want a complete racing game get Automobilista or Forza Apec rather than this expensive physics simulator.

5377	0	a	ok, so time has passed, I have an i7 now, graphics card is a G980 and everything looks great(ish). Development has progressed and the game is GA. So I thought why not take another look. I failed to configure the G25 steering wheel properly (so input of 30 degree gets interpreted as 360 degree, I got interrupted in my off-line practice session by the game trying to connect to the internet after running for 15 minutes (no, not steem, that game did) and ontop of that I had 0 fun.  I am not sure if its fair to call this a real issue (although these are issues for me), but I can't be asked with it. The menus are badly organised and poorly implemented, the automatic steering configuration stops working when I try to center the wheel, The driving is completly unrealistic (I can drive a lotus elise around Imola for real, but fail to do so in the game) and I have come to the conclusion it is just nmot for me.  I am sure someone will point out something obvious like steering calibration, but I tried that in the game and it failed. No doubt this is all my fault again, but I am a user who paid money for this. I wish i hadn't.  ---- original review  It seems that the trend of early releases continues, in line with other toxic internet trends. If you are looking for an enjoyable experience this game is n0t it. If you are looking for quality, look somewhere else. Aparently releasing limited, buggy code is ok. Asking for money for this is just laughable, yet I fell for it. Simply put, stay away unless you want to pay for testing privaledges, because that is what you are becoming, a paying tester. The driving is sluggish, the code is buggy as hell (I keep getting video setting alert from windows, that interfere with the code so everything stops working, there is no code optimisation to create a high performance race game - at least my 8 core computer, NVDIA 2GB, 8GB of RAM are not fast enough to make it past basic settings). To boot there is no racing, just trying to get good lap times. It is still a mess, and that is ok for a .5 version, but pleease don't make people pay for playing it. If you can't fund a development program, don't start it.

5379	0	a	While this game seems to have an avid fanbase, and lots of people who swear by it, I can only speak for my own experience.  I bought this game a long time ago, and I bought it because it had VR support. Imagine, a beautiful racing game with VR support. At the time, that was fascinating.  What I didn't know was that they had 'temporarily' removed VR support from the game, in the same week that I'd bought it. This meant that I would never get the chance to try it in VR, as they never added it back in, even months and months later.  I can't tell you how the game works, how pretty it is, or how great the physics are, I've never actually played it.   My 'not recommended' is simply because they advertized it as 'SteamVR' when I bought it, and it's never actually worked for me.  Is the game good? I've heard it is. But, for me, this will remain on my library list as a sad reminder of a VR experience I was so excited to try, and never got the opportunity to.  :*(

5389	0	a	TL:DR - It had frame rate problem even on my 10k pc. Sad.  I bought this game to drift on my race wheel, which worked great! It had tons of settings, but that game frame rate was just horrible. At that time I had a 760 GTX overclocked and a I5 4670k overclocked, 8gb of ram and I was getting a max of 30 fps on all setting. Forcing the game to 32 bit helps but still was getting a max of 30-32 fps. Fast forward about 1 year, I purchased a VR headset and wanted to try it on this game. I also upgrade my pc over that year or so. I am running a 980 ti and the same I5 and 16gb of ram plus 23gb of page memeory on my Intel 720 ssd (CRAZY FAST) and still getting around 35 fps which sure is an improvement but that still not playable for me, and vr sucks below 90fps  Extra info - This was done on solo play with no AI, I did change mirror relfection a known fps eater and still nothing help, was on lowest, medium and highest setting I could get still poor fps.  I'd not recommand this game for any price other then if it was free or below 10$ and you are will to play at 30 fps.

Edit: also charging this amount of money, then adding expansive DLC that add such small amount of content.
5395	0	a	The only 'game' i've ever asked for a refund on Steam, this thing needs to be advertised as a physics sim and not as a game, whoever designed the UI has zero idea about designing an interface for a videogame, the people who made AC seems to be pretty strange to videogames, let alone racing videogames, nothing on the menu is where it should be and you can't use a gamepad on the settings, menu or start screen, it forces you to use mouse and keyboard like this was 1997, the software also performs like crap giving no more than 30 fps on a machine that can easily max actual racing games like project cars at silky smooth 60 FPS.  This thing is not a game it's more like a software to test and tune expensive PC racing wheels, if you want an intuitive racing game, got project cars or wait for forza to be released on PC.

5415	0	a	After playing the game for over an hour, I personally think that some of the cars don't handle like they should and it makes the game very difficult to play.   When I bought the game, it cost £29.99, which I think is too much for what it is. I am aware the price has now gone down but even now I think it is still too much.  However, the graphics are pretty good but overall I just feel it isn't worth the money it asks for, mainly due to the fact that some cars are pratically uncontrollable with my G27 and the game is just the same thing over and over again.  Tried to refund this game but steam decided not to let me.... :(

5424	0	a	1 hour Assetto Corsa was enough to request a refund. wow, I am so disapointed by this overestimated game. the tracks a looking so cheap, the enginge sounds are generic like hell. I dont get it why this game so overestimated. My Fanatec wheel did not work the way how I am used to it from Raceroom. Steering rotation ok, but where is the steering lock? I dont wann hack files in the programm folder. The engine is allways running in the garage!? what? how can yoou focus on setting up a car while you hearing this generic engine sounds?

5437	0	a	I had to correct my initial review. This game is a good DRIVING game. It has a good stack of various cars available from the start, very accurate tracks and beautiful engine. Its also modable, so there is a lot of 3rd party content out, some even have AAA quality.   The AI is very bad. It is either very slow or alien fast. Their speed is very inconsistent, they go very fast through one corner and very slow in the next one. They will never(!) race you. Put your car beside them and they will let you pass, they will never try to pass you back.  The multiplayer is not ready for release. The netcode is terrible, small contacts will often cause huge crashes. There is no flag system. The damagemodel does not make any sense(your front windscreen shatters, when someone hits you from behind).  Conclusion: It is a good driving game, nothing more. If you want to get some seroius racing done, wether online or offline(against ai), then this is NOT the game for you. Better stick to GSC or iRacing for that matter.  Why did click 'not recommended'? This game is advertised as a racing sim, but it isn't. There are a lot of core features missing (flagsystem, proper racestarts, rollingstarts, penalties,multiplayer ui, etc.). Last year the Nordschleife was announced to be released in fall 2014. Its not here, but they already annouced additional content. Despite being no longer 'Early Access', this game is not finished and for the current price of 44,99€, I cannot recommend it.
5438	0	a	This game, however awesome the first few days, is stuck in development for AGES. And now they are finally adding some content, they´re making people -who were kind enough to actually BUY the unfinished game (not ♥♥♥♥ing cheap either)- PAY for it? They must be having a laugh out there. Absolutely outrageous. Never buying anything from this rank amateurs again.
5439	0	a	I do not think this is a good game. I do not consider it as a simulator, it does not has race flags, you can't start in first gear, the UI is horrendous, and the pitstop is more than worst. The AI is really bad and both circuits and cars are few.  They started to launch DLC to cost the console version, and doesn't look like they will add more content. The current price of 45€ It's a steal.  Worth 10€ if you need to purchase heach DLC at 8€, don't pay more.
5440	0	a	Mix: As of March 13, 2015. It is so hardcore that an average player will be spinning all time, they need to improve the sensibility of the throtle control for gamepad users as the R3E has done.   Pros:  Handling is good and steering is perfect Force feedback is excellent,  Cockpit view is the only that gives the feeling of speed Graphics are not bad (Raceroom and SHIFT2 have better)  Cons: - A lot of cheating, Cheaters manage to bypass the checksum file -Yellow flag rules are not enforced, some players overtake under yellow flags or crashes into a player that is careful because of the accident ahead and/or at the next turn - Lapped cars under a blue flag are not forced to slow down and yield/ give way or they should make them invisible - There is not a cause a coallition penalty system - There is not a reputation points, that it could be linked a driver with the number of race incidents and/or penalties that could help filter/prevent bad drivers from joinning clean racing servers  -Very limited car selection -Very few tracks/circuits -During qualifying putting all wheels off the kerb and/or white line at some corners do not disallow the lap,  -There is not ping cap for online multiplayer races. it is difficult to avoid laggy players on track - Servers badly configured, it should be 8 mins of Qualifying and 6 lap race the lower standard, practice should be assigned for offline single player. -During qualifying in the out lap 2 wheels go over the white line, and then on the 1st hotlap, it gets disallowed. -Sometimes, online racing will display a 'WARNING CPU OCUPPANCY' making everthing laggy and frozen -Schedule/table sector times are missing, it could be helpful to see where time is being lost -Lack of tracks/circuits on public servers -Game pad - sensibility need futher adjustments throttle and brakes (check Raceroom Racing Experience) -Brakes Damage setting is very fragile, which makes the game unplayable. -Lack of more filtering options on online servers lobby -Online Multiplayer is unbalanced a lot of cheater manage to by pass the sumcheck file -Breaking is not precise and it feels laggy.  -Engine sounds needs more development. (Raceroom, SHIFT 2 and Dirt 2 have better sound quality) -Sometimes sound is lost during gameplay  -Chase camera jumps and shakes alot even after adjustment.  -Lack of feel of speed, it is not accurate in the other camera views, except cockpit view
5441	0	a	I would give Asseto Corsa a passing grade, the multi player sever setup is a ♥♥♥♥ing joke. The days that you had to setup a server to game like this has long passed!!!! The menu's are setup poorly.  THE BEST THING TO DO WITH THIS GAME IS TO DELETE IT !!!!!!!
5442	0	a	game is terrible with a pad awesome with a sterring wheel game is over rated , menus are dull no music feels unpolished . its unispiring stuff. the game suffers from the syndrome of *we have a bit of a cack game so weel make the handling over the top to account for it* some cars feel good some are shocking. get pcars when it comes . cant wait to unistall this 'gt' of this generation
5443	0	a	Very disappointed.....worst online multiplayer system I can remember in years....its ancient and clunky. The game looks great, but I was really let down. I'd suggest saving your money unless you're into hard-core realistic simulators. I was looking for something more like Gran Turismo and this fell way short. Pretty game though... :P
5444	0	a	5 months after the release of the full version, it still isn't possible to control the menus with a gamepad or racing wheel. That's just pure lazyness, and can not be excused. This game is meant to be played with a wheel, and while I do have a fancy wireless keyboard with touchpad, it's annoying as hell having to grab it after each race.  Don't get me wrong, it's a great racing game, and the physics as well as the force feedback (G27) are the best I've ever seen. But releasing payed DLC when you haven't even solved the most basic UI issues just screams for a bad review.  If you're a racing game / simulation enthusiast and own a decent wheel, grab it while it's on sale, but I can not recommend this at full price.

5447	0	a	The game is realistic, but the grapichs and tracks makes the game boring very fast.
5448	0	a	Version 1.9 -  The Graphics:  Porsche's... amazing, but the tweeks to the Audio in the game ruins the inclusion of these cars.   The Audio:  Wow! its Horrible now! what are they doing to this game? During play, its ok, but it sure lost something with these 'improvements' 'tweaks' theyre doing. What a shame.  The Replays:  Dynamically adjust from 16 ms/60 fps or 33 ms/30 fps, its a jarring and ugly transition.  To fix this, Uncheck 'Full Screen Rendering' in the Display Options.  The Audio during replays, sounds OFF... and very odd at times. It was more intense, directional and immersive in 1.8  Version 1.8 -  Assetto Corsa is shaping up to be the best Racing Game on any platform. Each update shows improvement.
5449	0	a	this game is bad dont waste ur money on a dumb game like this yes it looks nice but thats the only + for this game   driving feel swampy and all cars somhow seem to be hovering above track. also all cars lean over a lot as do they all seem to have major understeer.  hopefully they get to fix it cause the game it has potential   a lot off nice cars altho id like to see even more special cars  car brands i miss are lamborghini, tvr, lancia, and there surely wil be even more i didnt mention  and you can use difrent kinda controllers stil the settings keep messing up  steeringspeed as steering angel the game has also lag no propher replays ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ car setups  fwd tend to understeer rwd tend to oversteer ai drives flawless at unreal speeds  even the feeling of speed has total lack when you drive 180 kmh it stil feels like 40 kmh  also cars dont steer and real life cars like youre granny has are faster around the track then those cars they stuffed in here !!!!!!!!
5450	0	a	I have to give this game a thumbs down for the fact that it will not load regularly. Since purchasing the game on March 24, 2015, I have not been able to get the game to play consistently. I have an open thread going on AC's support forum but nothing seems to work for my situation. I have reinstalled, updated, refreshed, and tried everything on their FAQ page and the issue still isn't corrected.   http://www.assettocorsa.net/forum/index.php?threads/wont-start-through-steam-or-desktop.22672/ 
5451	0	a	was a backer and well they now want to milk me again to play or i should say as some think this is ok ... to add new cars  way too soon so to you a goodbye ...
5452	0	a	I give up. This game has so much *potential*... the developers put an amazing amount of work into making the physics right and the handling great.  But all that effort is wasted, poured out like water on the ground, because the AI is horrible. Pole Position, from 1983, had better AI than this game. Every race you enter, you'll restart a dozen times trying to make it around the first corner without being run off the road or spun out by a clueless AI driver and their monomania to be exactly on the racing line, even if you're already there (and ahead of them). One touch from the AI car, and you go spinning down the track, while they proceed uninhindered.  If that wasn't bad enough, the penalty system is an insane joke. If you exit a corner too fast and drift a bit too far over a curb, you are suddenly 'cutting' the track. So you have to slow down for 10 seconds. As you watch the clock tick down, and your opponents speed past, the clock resets itself back to 10 if you accidentally touch a control. The upshot is that if you drive one pixel too far over a curb, the race is over and you must restart.  AI drivers, on the other hand, are blissfully unaware of these penalties, and will drive over the same spot that gave you a penalty and suffer no ill effects.  I'm amazed that the developers would spend so much time an effort on a game, and then ignore these fatal flaws. All of these things have been pointed out, repeatedly and often, in the comments, but nothing has changed.  This game is unplayable. Worse, its not fun.
5453	0	a	I primarily bought this game to drive the Nordschleife, which I now don't want to pay another 15 Euro for. NO car handles that crappy. They all drive like ♥♥♥♥. Understeer or oversteer to the extreme no matter what you do. Waste of money.
5454	0	a	Great game.  But you will never see it became a real final version game, It will always be in a kind of beta state. No weather changes, online mode is very poor... things like that.   R$90 On that sh..it ! The menu of the game crashs all the time!!! If you wanna host a online server you ´ll have use a external software, extremely difficult to use, and I have never see it working.  There are worried about making more DLC and new sales, even with the game as incomplete and full of bugs  Consider the actual state if you´ll buy it. But is an awesome racing simulator, maybe the best one.
5455	0	a	I expected so much about this game and it really disapointed me :(. Dont buy this game for 50 dollars, theres nothing much to do in it, rare updates, lots of buggs and small amount of cars..... If you like racing games definetly get The Crew....
5456	0	a	Current state 6.5/10.  I bought this game on sale ($20) and was a little uneasy at first because  there wasn't a demo  I couldn't find the demo and I almost never spend that much on games (praise GabeN), in the end, only worth what I payed.  The developers inconsistant, but it has a great fanbase (including rFactor, iRacing and LFS) who develop maps, liveries and cars (aprox. a LOT of maps and 40 cars released but HUNDREDS in development).  The stock game has 31 cars and 13 tracks (though only ~15 unique cars due to racing variants).  At this moment, the game is not easy to play with a 360 controller but I use a G27 racing wheel and it is good.  The physics are OK but are pretty inconsistent and the cars are pretty low polly, the only real beauty in the game is the shaders.  Pros: - Good simulator - Beautiful looking game - Good community  Cons:  - UI can be difficult to learn and still lacks 'easy' navigation - No keyboard mapping in-game yet (though I'm not sure if you can change the config's) - HUGE CPU load with AI at the start of races (my 4.5GHz 3770K runs @ 95%) causing 3FPS for roughly 5 seconds - Unintelligent AI, they know you're there but will hit you in turns - THERE NEEDS TO BE IN GAME CONTROL/VIDEO/PROFILE EDITING, I do not want to have to wuit the race just to change the 'chnage view' button.  Overall 6.5/10 - I had to rewrite my review to give the game a much lower score... The developers hardly release anything and when they did it was DLC, there are barely any tracks, all the cars that come with the vanilla don't match up in races so 1v1 can be very difficult, no native servers so good luck finding one in your area with decent ping and anyone in it... The price is absolutely stupid and 100% would not buy it for half that. AT MOST the game is worth $30 including future potential, the devs always say they are working on new content or are signing manufacturers, BUT IT NEVER COMES...
5457	0	a	After an initially positive review (made during Early Access) it has been all downhill after 1.0. (a reminder of why Early Access titles shouldn't be seriously reviewed, I've learned my lesson). It seems the goal in the physics and force feedback department since launch has been to make the game increasingly less serious. Then again, how serious can a 'racing simulator' be taken when there are so many missing features that decent racing is pretty much impossible?  There are so many missing features that this game still feels very much like an Early Access game.  No enforced flag rules. No pit stops. No Races longer than 10 laps with AI because the AI is too stupid to add more fuel.  Longer races are impossible anyway because no pit stops. Did I mention it's a racing sim with NO PIT STOPS!!?? Multiplayer is a broken pile plagued with net code issues and so many missing features that serious league use isn't possible.  What we have here, then, is a somewhat pretty (if you can ignore the terrible aliasing even with the highest levels of AA forced on in the drivers) car physics sandbox for hot lapping and monkeying around with mods. Funnily enough, none of this has stopped Kunos from asking for money for 2 (soon to be three) DLC packs. And nothing stops the parade of fanboys who are ready to bully the hell out of anyone who dare utter a single negative syllable about the game. Seriously, the community behind this game sucks. They have become not much better than a gaggle of Call Of Duty squeakers.  Lesson learned. I shall never invest in another Early Access title. What sounds good in theory has become an excellent way for developers to get paid to break promises. If you like racing, don't waste your money.

5459	0	a	So dissapointed in this title.  The dlc was just pure moneymilking from the devs, the content never delivered on what they said in the pre-orders.  Support for it has been ♥♥♥♥♥♥, to non-existant.  Multiplayer is the worst racing experience I've had ever.  edit: originally I had said it was good and recommended it, it's a good game, it just didn't deliver and leaving a lot to modders isn't the way to go.

5463	0	a	It's an ok driving simulator but the car physics are unsatisfying.They look kind of unrealistic.The graphics are ok but not really anything special.It gets boring after a certain period of time.
5464	0	a	The game is amazing, superb. More cars and we are up and running   *EDIT* The inclusion of DLC for most cars and tracks with barely any updates otherwise has made me thing twice about recomending this game to anyone
5465	0	a	in 2014 this was the best driving experience going, great FFB and driving feel with a few holes in the racing experience. Sadly those holes still remain whilst the FFB and driving feel have gone backwards since August 2015 there's been a sharp decline in quality and standard simulation features that have been in racing simulations for decades now are absent, such as stalling your engine, overheating the engine or brakes, false starts, pit stops, even tyre expansion is not simulated.   On the plus side there's a lot of content for hotlaps, many cars that driving in real life would be a dream, outside of hotlapping these cars there's really not a lot on offer for single player as the often broken career mode follows nothing remotely resembling a real life championship and the AI at anything other than full track grip are unable to stay on track, whilst the multiplayer side has been sadly woeful for a long time with pings needing to be much lower to avoid comical crashes and lag events, and even then the crashes are still anything but realistic.  It's very hard to see a positive future for this title unless there is major attitute changes by the developers themselves as repeadted constructive critiques of these issues on their own forums has led to multiple bans to members shining light on these issues...  Bottom line for Assetto Corsa is do not take the tagline 'Your Racing Simulator' seriously, you will be sadly disappointed... If you want to test drive some high end road cars on a track all by yourself, then this might be for you... Otherwise, check out one of the many alternatives...

5468	0	a	What a wonderful game, but the sad fact is the community didn't stick around for too long.  Epigenesis is a very interesting title. It's a sports game mixed with fast paced parkour FPS. The goal is simple, you go to the center of the arena to capture a ball which you need to take to the opposite side of the arena and score goals, after each goal you get a seed which is used to set up boosters, defense systems and turrets to fight alongside with you. When you plant the final seed on the opposing hoop the game is instantly won.  The title looks alright for the most part and maxed out it runs almost perfectly, apart from some slight FPS drops when the action gets too fast.  The arenas are built so you have to jump around platforms to get to where you need to go and sometimes the jumping is really tough to control, sometimes you miss your mark and sometimes you go overboard.  The game has a single player mode which has five arenas to play through and you can choose how many bots are on the arena on your team and on the opposing team.   This game is great and is a ton of fun too, but there is one major flaw and that the game is completely dead. Unless you have a friend to play alongside with you except to play solo only.   The game alone is still pretty fun, but with people it would be even wore fun.  I would love to recommend this game to everyone, but unless you have a friend willing to play this with you, there's no point in buying just for solo play as you will play through every arena in an hour.  Final Rating: 5/10 - Buy it if you have friends who play it  If you liked this review please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you disliked post in the comments on why you disliked the review.

5469	0	a	I selfishly want to recommend this game just to try to get more people to play to actually experience what it could be because I really liked the idea and feel. But, I cannot.  I became enamored with the game over a free weekend. The sparsely populated servers with people as new and clueless as me made the game seem fun and the three-something dollar price tag appealing. I bit.   Over the course of the next week or two the population disappeared. But I was able to learn the nuances of the game and navigate the not-steep, but completely unexplained, learning curve thanks to spotty appearances of other players. This made the game seem fun all over again. Over the following weeks I became comfortable with the game and really enjoyed the few times another human was actually on a server. Some players were better, a lot were as lost as I previously was.  But in the end, I never witnessed a game larger than 2v3. Morning, noon or night. Any day of the week. Any server from West to East to Europe to Asia. There just isn't people playing this game. Perhaps some games just shouldn't be open betas or 'Early Access'? People were done and bored before it had legs.   Or perhaps other issues are really holding it back.  The learning curve isn't hard but requires other players to actually learn. There's documentation of what items do or how to prime your two jumps. But nothing about the useful ways to use the items, tactics to employ, using momentum from items/jumps/enemy fire, etc. All things you can only learn with a live enemy. And I still feel like I only really learned how to play 1v1 and what tactics to use in that situation because that's all I ever got to regularly.  The devs have an idea of what they believe gameplay *should* be like if you read around the web some. In the perfect world all the servers would be 5v5 and somebody would be playing 'goalie' and people would pass the ball. Combine those Ideas with the game that really does feel smooth and man that sounds great!  But the dead community means you'll rarely see 5v5 or in my case; never. I tried to play 'goalie' in a 2v2 after I had read about the concept on a forum. But it's just not a logical choice to do when you aren't realistically going to stop many chances.  And passing? That would make the game that much more interesting but the speed of the players (especially once powerups are planted) makes that a colossal undertaking to time correctly. And because of this, nobody ever expects a pass. I never witnessed anybody else even attempt one.   I could go on and on. Its a great concept that is fairly polished and fun in theory. But has a dead community and suffers from a multitude of other problems. I could never recommend it even at the price I paid much less it's regular price. My twenty-plus hours of play consists of maybe five with other players and maybe three of those five hours was 'competitive' play rather than goofing around. The vast majority of my play time was spent alone achievement hunting. The bots are awful.  If it gets lots of people suddenly, better maps (another issue I didn't delve into), and one or two other things I forgot to whine about... And it's like $0.99USD. Consider it.
5470	0	a	Good game if you have social anxiety because all the servers are empty.
5471	0	a	Game is great, community is non-existent
5472	0	a	+ Sci-Fi version of Quidditch, with awesome guns and boosters.  + Amazing concept. + Sweet visuals / aesthetics.  + Can be played with BOTs.  - Bad implementation of the Idea. - Chunky controls. - Dead online community, hard to find players.  Rating: 5/10 or maybe borderline 6/10 ~ 5.5/10  It's one of those titles which I'd like to give a 'NEUTRAL' rating, but since that can't be done.  I'll 'NOT' be recommending the game unless you can get a couple of friends to play it with you.

5519	0	a	  I got a free copy of the game years ago through my then-bf, and was supposed to have played with him against the developers, if I recall correctly. They cancelled the match on us, and I never really got a chance to fully experience the game as it was intended to be played, and since then lost interest in it.  From what little I did play, I thought it could've done well, but seeing that there's virtually no community here, I can't recommend it.

5523	0	a	Comunity is full of scumbags but if you got for free with the razer thing you can't complain about the the game because it's fun and you get that card profit

5538	0	a	Great gameplay, awesome devs, and a nice art style. This game should be MUCH more popular than it is. I recommend the devs do more free weekends. During those the servers are almost always full. When theres not a free weekend however, there is not a single person playing 99% of the time. You may catch the occasional 2 people on some russian server. I really really want to recommend you buy this game, but I cant knowing that there is virtually no one playing ever. If you are to find this game on sale and or during a free weekend PLAY IT.

5558	0	a	i cant understand these positive reviews.. this seems to be a 2hs game, cause is the time that u will farm the Trading cards and unistall it.
5559	0	a	Problems of this game:  1. FIRST AND MAIN: very bad quality of graphical engine, because of which I had about 20fps - obviously coding issues of game.  2. Weapon balance is NOT ok.  Please remove 'immediate accurate infinite range' weapons.  Choose only one of those 3 properties for each weapon.  Yes, i played this game only 20 minutes,but it's enough.  So, don't buy this fu**ing game.  3/10
5560	0	a	Get ready to fight for Honor! Get ready to fight for Glory! Get ready to....   play alone because the community is dead fall a lot because the jumping is bleh rage quit because you're playing alone and keep dying from falling.

5593	0	a	Epigenesis is not worth buying even though it is a functional game, because there isn't much to it other than simple gameplay and a few maps, and the worst fact being that virtually no one plays it... you will be forced to play against the AI most of the time.  Video of how the gameplay looks in Epigenesis:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdDolRIIWG0 
5594	0	a	A hardcore sports game that is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ 1/10 .
5595	0	a	Game is incredibly buggy - choose a server, it's full despite having 9/10 players (hardly any players by the way). Choose spectate, game exits to main menu before randomly spectating that server a full minute later.   Finally get on a server, game asks me to choose a side. Choose side 1, tells me side 1 is full despite no players being connected. Choose side 2, tells me side 1 is full and sends me back to side selection.   Start playing, asks me to choose a loadout but gives basically no instructions on differences between loadouts. Game starts with 3 players in a 2v1 scenario despite it saying the server is still full.
5596	0	a	played it for 8 minutes still can't ♥♥♥♥ing understand what am i supposed to do with that ♥♥♥♥ing ball, throw it in dev's ♥♥♥ ? that's a good idea wait i got it for free lmao
5597	0	a	It really needs detailed tutorial. It really needs more player to play with. It really needs better graphics. As for the rest, it could be a good team game like MNC
5598	0	a	Meh crappy game mechanics not worth ur time.
5599	0	a	The game itself is very fun and rewards skill. There is a slight learning curve but after you get past it, it's tons of fun.  The problem is that the community is 100% dead and the developers left the game to rot, and for that reason I can't reccomend the purchase unless you get this game free like I did. If you aren't playing with a stack of friends you'll be getting space slam dunks by yourself.
5600	0	a	Meh The game is alright, It is really bad IMO
5601	0	a	Yeah, this game is good but there is nothing called players. Player what is it!? This game dont include players. Say hi to new META of 2016, Singleplayer, multiplayer games... Community died already.

5630	0	a	Only fun with friends, cause the community is dead. Not recommended unless you have friends willing to play with you, if not, don't even bother buying it.

5632	0	a	I can't recommend this game but not because it's bad. Epigenisis is actually a really fun game but nobody plays it! I was always hard-pressed to find people online to have a good game with as the low challenge of the AI soon became unsatisfactory for me. The aim of the game is to grab the ball and run to the enemy goal and throw the ball in. It's quite a bit more complicated than that but that is the general gist of it. The game felt overall very well put together and had a really great concept with decent execution but fell down because of its heavy reliance on multiplayer gameplay but nobody playing it. It saddens me to have to give this game a thumbs down because it is so very fun to play but i simply can't with such a small player base.

7052	0	a	After reading what this game is about, I was disappointed in what I've played and not because the game is bad in any way or form. It was just plain boring in terms of gameplay mechanic, and the simulation aspect of it all. Yes I actually just beaten this game and I banged my head against my bathtub wishing this was a more complex simulator but instead is an arcadey, tedious, and casual game that needs way more work If you're wondering why I am not playing anymore of this game, This is how long it takes to beat the entire campaign. I think this game can be better than what it is and heres why.   The game starts off with you looking at the map and seeing that there are 3 Large areas you can explore in the game, You'll start in Thailand then go to South Africa reefs, the last and final reef is the Bahamas all of which is decently sized and looks great.  The gameplay is about spearfishing, Aim your speargun at a fish, shoot, and watch it automatically get reeled in with camera gameplay and treasure hunting thrown in.  The missions consist of the player searching for treasures around the area, look around and shoot fish or find treasures for 5-10 mins, find specific fish, or take pictures of fish. These missions will repeat most of the time. You can kill so many fish but when it comes to sharks, turtles, jellyfish, morays, stingrays and so on the game will have a don't shoot box over them. When you do try to shoot them you'll shoot AIR. EMPTY AIR, even if the game says don't shoot I SHOULD HAVE THE FREEDOM TO SPEAR THEM FOR THE HELL OF IT. If I do so I should also be punished for it instead such as being fined, or sharks coming back to bite me off. Something instead of empty air.  The graphics to this game is quite nice and there is a good amount of fish to see and capture, the open area in the water and the underwatercave are pretty nicely done also and each of the maps are a decent size. The sound and music to this game is also nicely done HOWEVER  The mechanic and gameplay to this game is absolutely boring and unimmersive and also very arcadelike. It is very fun during the beginning of the game for about 30 mins then it just became repetitive and boring. Whenever you shoot a fish you'll acquire xp and gold which makes this annoying coin sound as if you're playing a slot game ruining the immersion of the game completely. After earning enough gold which takes about 5 mins or less of you swimming around shooting every fish you see in sight, you can then spend to upgrade 4 different things, your camera, more usb slots to take picture of fish, speargun accuracy and length, and your swim fins, once you fully upgrade all this. You'll swim at a really fast speed and any fishy you see can easily be minced meat basically because you'll become the son of poseidon himself. You're basically done and gold will completely become useless except for spending on more usb slots to take pictures of fish. Hell even the picture taking mechanic is pretty drysince all you need to do is point it as close to the fish as possible to take a picture as long as they are in the frame, the numbers also have to be 100% or you cant get points for taking thier pictures. Theres nothing in this game that can kill you except make you lose oxygen and there is nothing challenging about the breathing in this game at all, just swim to top and your oxygen can be filled fully without a single struggle, the only way you lose is when you forget that you're not diving but snorkeling.  I think the game could do much better than this in future sequel. I want to be able to control the pulling of the fish in, Taking the spear out the fish or cutting the lines once I hunt them, drag them back to the boat feeling the weight of hunting. Instead of just picking up treasures from the ground with one button players should be forced to brush off the sand and figure out how to extact the treasure out carefully. Also the fact that I should be able to shoot any animal I want and in doing so will have a consequence on my gold or what not instead.  If you're going to give players levels and XP in a game it should have a reason except that it was completely pointless. Right now this game has an awsome concept, but it needs to build on that concept and make itself AMAZING. I am not easily impressed because it was downright too simple, super casual.  If you think I am lieing Go download the game and play it, Congratulations you've basically played 80% of the game for free.  I also want to warn you guys of the dev pulling a fast one on bundle buyers which someone has come to my attention about.   http://www.reddit.com/r/GameDealsMeta/comments/2e9yqd/depth_hunter_2_has_been_greenlit_get_your_steam/   http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=saxg1h&amp;s=8   Long story short? Dev promised to try to get keys for people on desura etc, then turned around and rebundled game into a different name and in turn changed thier tune after getting greenlight. He didn't make a different game but took the same game and change its name so he doesn't have to give them keys. I would look up more about this company before you make your purchase in the future. This is something I do not condone from developers of breaking promises. Will not be buying anymore products in the future hell don't even send it to me for free.  +Great Graphics +Good sized open area +Shooting fish is satisfying  +Great amount of fish to shoot at +Sport is Extreme   - Gameplay mechanic too simple, gets SUPER tedious - Can't shoot jellyfish, turtles, sharks, morays, dolphins, crabs, urchins, reefs, sponges and the list goes on - No multiplayer of any kind or score comparisons - Missions are downright tedious and boring, Find treasure, shoot a certain fish, or search out a fish with waypoints showing you directly where the fish is. Sometimes the treasure quest tells you to search in a 40km area then becomes boring as sin searching 30 mins on the ground clicking.  My advice is to shelf out 10 more dollars, head to early access and get world of diving.
7053	0	a	Should be titled 'Being a ♥♥♥♥ to fish simulator'  Swim around and spear fish in a little reef. Hunt for treasure. 'We've got no idea what artifacts could be down there but here's 10 very specific items you need to find, oh yeah one of them looks exactly like the foliage. No, we don't care if you pick up fifteen other artifacts, we want this one' and generally faff about.  You can't shoot crabs but they insta-aggro the moment you come around. You can take pictures of stuff but the game had no regards for composition of the photos. Just ram the camera into them and snap.  Probably the biggest sin of them all though. MOUSE ACCELERATION.  It's unable to turn off and it's spastic. Also, sometimes you'll run low on oxygen (The game doesn't tell you that you can surface to get more air but you can) and if the game wants to it'll insta-fail the mission but other times it'll just hover a 1% and allow you to swim underwater forever.  Yeah, Don't get it. I'm glad I got a Greenlight Bundle key.
7054	0	a	It's not easy for me to write this review. If that game didn't have such beautiful underwater world, I would say that is nothing more than crap. But it has so stunning graphics and everything looks and move so natural, that I couldn't stop just looking around. This is definitely the nicest underwater world I've ever seen in video game. But this is still a game. So what can you do as a gamer? You can catch fishes, take photos and look for treasures. All three just suck. Gaming part is boring and there is no challenge at all. And because we are all gamers and we expect good games, I can't evaluate this game in different way. Why do I have so many hours in that game? Because to get last achievement, I had to turn it on for 2 bloody nights - that's ridiculous!  VERDICT: If you are a real gamer and you are in a mood to play something challenging, avoid this title for all cost. But if you are a fan of sea diving or just want to enjoy really beautiful nature and make some cool screenshots, think of thumb down you see, as thumb up and take it without question, you won't regret that.

7055	0	a	★★☆☆☆ - 'Average at best, Id give it a miss'   PROS: - Not many diving games out there so offers something different - Casual game which is rather relaxing - Lots of trading cards if your into that type of thing. - Almost a sort of hidden object game - Has DLC to expand your experience  CONS: - Poor animations, reeling in a fish is just laughable considering its the main mechanic - Frustrating to catch some fish, this provides the only challenge of the game but it proves annoying rather than enjoyable - Overly simplistic, from the menus to the difficulty, nothing attacks you either. - Its very monotonous and boring, you catch fish and take pictures with very little variety.  VERDICT?  Its an okay game but I can't recommend it, its just a bland game which fails to do anything well so its not worth your money.
7056	0	a	I went into this game with mixed expectations. On the one hand I utterly adore underwater games and their setting, on the other I hate hunting in every way, shape or form. What I figured would happen is that there would be the fun underwater exploration and swimming around competing with the actively hurting fish aspect and that depending on which part was more prominent I'd give it a positive or a negative review...  Turns out it went a different way.  There are three locales in the game, which you'll go through in order. Each has a variety of missions... which you'll go through in order. They range from catching specific fish, to catching as many fish as you can in a specific amount of time (no minimum amount for success) to finding treasures or taking pictures. To summarize, these are... lacklustre. At no point did I feel challenged, engaged or even relaxed by these missions.  The hunting aspect of the game is present, but forgiveable as there is no blood, no real skill involved and as long as you're super close to the fish not even any animations... I'm not sure that's a good thing in general, but for me it was.  Progression through the missions as well as capturing / photographing fish and finding coins and treasures give you money and EXP. Money is used for upgrades which make you swim a bit faster, require you to go up for a air less and to make the fishing and photographing slightly easier. I will  always  approve of an upgrade system, and I'm glad it's there... but I wish it would do a bit more. It's easy to get everything and the levels you gain do little more than unlock a few of the upgrades and then just give you bonus coins, and if I were to play a level on somebody else's profile and then be asked if he or she had all of the upgrades or none of them I wouldn't be able to tell.  Lacklustre is the name of the game here, and I can't say I recommend it. It's better to just wait until  World of Diving  makes it out of early access.  ---  I did not factor this into the review, but I felt it was relevant to point out that there has been some criticism towards the developer regarding some of their business decisions. Depth Hunter 1 was part of several game bundles and had promised Steam keys once the game made it here, instead it hasn't and we get Depth Hunter 2 instead which is supposedly practically identical. Seemingly critical updates (like adding a radar for finding treasure that is strewn about) and more than the original 3 levels are locked away in DLC ( review of that here ). I'm not saying you shouldn't buy the game because any of that, but be mindful of it.
7057	0	a	The look controls make this game all but impossible for me to play. Even when your mouse stops moving, the view keeps going in that direction.
7058	0	a	Unless you are specifically looking for a game that is very casual, relaxing, and underwater, I see no reason why anyone would or should purposefully buy this. I got this as an addition to a Bundle Stars pack and figured I try it out since I like games like Subnautica and Farsky. This game is not like those at all. It's more like Cabela's hunting games without the excitement.  There are only three maps and you get missions to accomplish in each one. They basically boil down to 'kill X number of fish' and 'find X number of treasures'. There's no challenge to the game at all except your own patience with it. There's sharks, and they swim away from you in fear. The doesn't allow you to shoot anything besides specific fish also.
7059	0	a	lol mouse accel can't be turned off
7060	0	a	What in the world? You promised mi THAT much, DLC, and fun, and what i've got? - some cheap flash fishshooter. Boring around like a paralitic idiot don't entertains me. Theese upgrades, weird quests, only thing that looks FINE in this game is the chillout texture of water why going outta water. You could do so much cool stuff and You'd go after fishing planet. Geez.  + at least it's not as bad as some games from greenlight. at least it got fish, duh.  - I've seen many games cheaper that had better graphics and sound effects. Yeah it's pretty boring after 15 minutes. The feeling when you shot fish from 50 meters and there comes quest that unables you to hit it from 2 meters and then they take like a half of your money. not cool. The game DON'T look like on the preview pics, They had no balls to show how much NOT action rhis game contains I'm hepeful taht they'll give me my money back EVEN Fishing planet gives more satisfaction Christ, an YOU want FIFTEEN EURO for this crap - people there are like TONS of better games cheaper than that lol.
7061	0	a	I've long wanted a cool underwater simulator, not for combat but just exploration. Depth Hunter 2 could have been that game except for one massive failure.  There is no way to remap the keys. In the 21st century, lacking this feature is simply unforgivable.  Deleted.
7062	0	a	Depth Hunter 2: Deep Dive is a casual and relaxing first-person diving/snorkling game where you explore 3 different locations (Thailand, South Africa and the Bahamas) to search for gold and treasures, hunt fish or take photos of the underwater life.   Story
7063	0	a	The graphics are fine, cool seeing the underwater life. Creates nice relaxing ambiance. Problems :Only 3 levels, takes like 2-3 hours to beat. Most of the fish look the same. You can't do anything with the other cool animals. You use the same gun the whole game, and do the same 3 things (catch fish, take pic, collect meaningless similar looking treasures) every level. No story, you just randomly do missions at the few spots. The upgrades are uninteresting and not that helpful (besides longer breath holding). Your sprint runs out in 3 seconds, takes 30 seconds to refill, and doesn't move you much faster. Then there is a terrible part of the final level where you have to collect 10 different fish, but you don't know what you've collected, and what you have left to collect, which doesn't help since all the fish look identical. Having a list for you to see would have worked, but instead they inflate game length by having you swim around continuously looking for that single last fish, of which you're not sure which it is, while you catch more of the same fish you already have. Other pointless tasks like (collect fish for 5 min) are obvious grabs for increased game length and lack of creativity, especially since it doesn't matter how much you catch. Your levels stop mattering after like 10, but they go up to 30. I have tons of gold but had already bought the 4 possible upgrades. Just a boring repetitive game with nice atmosphere and a stupid final mission. 4.5/10.
7064	0	a	Now, I just want to start off by saying that I don't recommend this game, but that doesn't mean it's a BAD game. Honestly, I think it's a very good example of what it is ... that's just not a genre I like too much.  Back in the 90s, there was a popular screensaver that was just a bunch of fish swimming around. This game puts you in the role of a hunter/photographer/treasure hunter in that screensaver. It's pretty enough, if not spectacular; it just doesn't have a whole lot of point. Like the screensaver, it's more there just to help you relax, with small goals and incremental upgrades to make you feel like you're accomplishing something.  If you want to tool around and chill in a pseudo-underwater environment, get this game. If you want to play a game, look elsewhere.
7065	0	a	A quite boring game with a very repetitive task within the whole game, playing this game for half an hour would make you instantly tired and bored. 'Killed a fish, killed another fish, find treasure, find treasure, can't find the treasure anymore, spends 15 minutes finding the next treasure, ran out of air and died' :D 2/10
7066	0	a	so far not very good dlc should be free as game hasnt got much to do. I will update this as i find stuff to entertain me in this but as for now i cant see why its worth that price   well if you like collecting coins and enjoyed the nintendo this is for you with nintendo style models and pritty lame ingame ui just seems devs give up when they added everything to the sea.  Could of been good but needs an update to bring into 2014 not 1998
7067	0	a	Overall:  * 3/10 * Casual spearfishing game (Supposed to be.. Its not really) * Frickin Child-proof * VERY Pricey. 2,5$ for a DLC for this game.. Give me a break..  Pros:  * Good graphics * Good &amp; needed idea/concept * Plenty of fish types  Cons:  * 2 hrs of gameplay.. Thats what you get at most.. And thats because I went around aimlessly. * So easy to play you can hardly say there is a game here.. You cant miss.. While spearfishing???!!! You can be shootin at an angel fish at 15 mt and still you will hit %100 and reel in.. There is absolutely ZERO difficulty.. No challanges. * Game is by default child-proof.. You cant shoot at anything you want. Its so stupid.. You cant fire your speargun in water. Has to be a target.. You cant shoot any target... Ridiculous.. * Sound effects are like a casino game.. You get a slot machine sound everytime you catch fish or pick up something from ocean floor.. Its Vegas spearfishing.. * No realistic animal behavior.. You can head-butt a shark.. And it just stays there.. No reaction. Nothing.. * One of additional equipment in game is 'extra 6 MINUTES oxygen'.. You become a submarine.. What kind of free diving world do you live in that I hold my breath additional 6 minutes and exert myself swimming around full speed with a speargun.. * The lousy trick that the developer pulled to some people who bought his greenlight bundle.. (+++Rep to Kenuty being the only person in Negative reviews mentioning it)  Conclusion:  There is no game here.. This is not even arcade. No content. Spend your money on real games. There are great games for the same amount of money where Devs really develop a REAL game... I didnt know about the scam they pulled before I bought the game. If I knew, I wouldnt buy it. They promised people keys while in Greenlight, in a bundle and when they get Greenlit, they changed the name of the game, made some tweaks and didnt give out their keys..   TL; DR: What a WASTE OF MONEY... Do not buy.. Look elsewhere  
7068	0	a	 KAMGUSTA's mini Review   An immersive (LOL) and relaxing dive hunting game... In the first mission I killed 65 fishes with a 95% precision in just 5 minutes. And that's without the advanced gear. Yup, it's that easy. An Unreal Tournament in the ocean with harmless mobs!! Nice try, but it's a no.   Score 5/10 
7069	0	a	Graphics are great. The ocean environment feels alive and beautiful.   Gameplay however is just.. meh. Spear fishing is too easy that I managed to get 100% accuracy in all campaign missions. All you have to do to get 100% accuracy is to get close enough to the target until the reticle is green, and then left click it. The target will be reeled in automatically. This makes missions just too ridiculously easy.  Other gameplay elements such as camera photography is also added, but the gameplay is still similar to spear fishing: go near until the quality is 100%, then take the snapshot.  Environmental hazards are simply sea urchins and crabs, which will only decrease your oxygen, which can be regained easily.  Overall, beautifully done ocean graphics, gameplay needs tons of improvements.
7070	0	a	A very bland and boring 'shoot fish and pick stuff up' simulator. Not much depth, and not much to see. The controls are extremely awkward, as you can only move back and forth in the direction you're facing with a little bit of strafing, no 'up' key. Combined with needing to pick items up off the ground, and there being dangerous stuff placed haphazardly on the ground, a decent amount of time is spent rubbing your face on the ground and trying to back away from the ocean floor.  If the game concept seems really interesting to you, maybe get it on sale, but otherwise this really isn't worth it.
7071	0	a	:(
7072	0	a	Very relaxing game that also looks nice, but the tasks are simple, barely challenging with little to no room for failure. Good as a time killer, okay, but I'm simply fetching items while not having fun.
7073	0	a	I have to be brutally honest about this game.  If this game wasnt part of a bundle I bought I would demand my money back.  The game lacks gameplay, its downright boring. The controls feel like they have been put together with blutack and masking tape, plus there is no real point to the game at all.   Its a take a picture of fish, capture a few and swim underwater sim.   The only thing decent about the game is the textures and the way the fish move, the dev's obviously studied fish movement and incorporated it into the game.  Sorry dev's this game is just not for me at all,
7074	0	a	Very boring, skilless game. Fish don't swim away until you're about to touch them, and you can't shoot until you're on a fish, so you can just spam shoot while swimming up to them and you'll always catch one. The missions are bland and tedious, and exploration is pointless considering how easy it is to get all of the upgrades. I got this game in a bundle, so its not a big deal to me, but I would nver reccommend that someone pay full price for it. All this game has going for it is okay graphics. 3/10
7075	0	a	I expected too much from it :/
7076	0	a	Got this game with a Humble Bundle and haven't play it much, but the little I did play did not do it for me. Cheap looking graphics and confusing, poor game play. Didn't want to invest any more time in it than I did. I do not like skewering devs because they can what I cannot but in all honesty I cannot recommend this game. 3/10 is the best I can go but don't ask what makes it a 3 please. The Managment. Unite and free the Tunas!
7077	0	a	İts so easy and you just fishing don't more.
7078	0	a	Painfully repetitive and boring, wouldnt recommend
7079	0	a	Boring and unpolished.  PROS: -Pretty locales. -Calm environments.  NEUTRAL: -Pointless upgrade system  CONS: -Very boring, no real gameplay -Can only catch fish. Can't interact with any other animal. 'Don't Shoot' appears if you aim at them.... -Can't rebind keys (and you can't look up the controls anywhere) -Sloppy controls (when moving the mouse, it continues to 'slide' in the direction after you stop moving it...) -Graphics aside, could pass for a browser game. All you do is point at a fish for a few seconds until your cursor turns green then click.
7080	0	a	lol Fish simulator
7081	0	a	Nice diving simulator but thats all of it. Gets boring after 30 min.  3/10. Not recommended.
7082	0	a	Part of me wants to recommend the game because it's the only one of its kind on Steam, and it is functional, but unless you *need* a game where you can swim around and look at fish, it's just not worth it. Graphics are the main selling point, they're not spectacular, but good enough. The mission structure is annoying, but unfortunately the only way to unlock the free dive mode for each area. Playing with a controller is a struggle, because the trigger for both the speargun and the camera is mapped to the A button, which makes it very difficult to aim and shoot, and there's currently no way to remap the controls. Also be aware that spearing fish is necessary to complete missions and unlock the free dive mode, so if you're completely against killing of any kind (as has come up in the discussions section) this is not the game for you.
7083	0	a	Did you love those old 'Dream Aquarium' screensavers but thought that their gameplay were just a little bit too exciting and complex?  Do you love hidden object games but thought that merely clicking the objects simply wasn't slow and tedious enough?  Do you love hunting simulators but think that their AI is simply too clever for you and that they would be a lot more fun if simply very slowly walking up to your prey until your crosshair turns green would be a lot more fun than aiming and shooting?  Then Depth Hunter (2) is the game for you. It's slow, tedious, dull and boring all wrapped into what looks like a half-decent aquarium screensaver.  And if you were wondering why Depth Hunter 1 can't be found on Steam: It's essentially the exact same game with a few features missing. The only reason this is called Depth Hunter 2 is so that the developers could avoid giving out the promised Steam keys after Depth Hunter (not 2) had been greenlit.
7084	0	a	Depth Hunter 2, the Name says it all.  Basically you swim around and cowboy your way through the Areas, the only thing that can stop you are some red warning Lables that tell you not to kill Turtles, Manta Rays, Crabs and some other Species.  You can also collect Gold Coins and Treasures, for my taste there are 'a little' too many of them.  You can earn Gold with hunting, completing challenges or taking Pictures of the Lifeforms and use it to buy upgrades for your Camera, Harpoon or your Oxygen supply so you dont have to swim to the Surface every few Minutes.  You cant die, when you run out of Oxygen, you will just be 'teleportet' to the Water Surface.    Some Positive and Negative things short:    + The Game has easy Controls and is easy to understand. + As mentioned, you can upgrade Weapon, Oxygen Supply and Camera. + The Water looks good + You can hunt some of the Species + Only a small downloadsize of ~500Megabytes  - No Multiplayer - Sealife animation looks weird, almost like on rails. - Annoying and Facebookgame like Music and Sounds. - Overall the Engine and Textures, beside the Water itself, look really dated and ugly. - Rather small gaming Areas - The Mouse movement and acceleration... oh well...   Not sure what to say as closing word. Lets say its fun for a little while, but you will forget about it really fast. Also if you really, really want it, i would wait for a ~75% sale! its not worth the current price of 14,99€.
7085	0	a	The game is fun, but also riddled with pretty bad bugs and awful game design. If you're not a huge fan of diving it probably won't take your fancy.
7086	0	a	What I like The water effects and underwater graphics  What I don't like Everything else  The game gets boring in about an hour. After 3 hours you simply can't stand to look for brown treasure on a brown ocean bottom any longer without simply going insane. I have to say that the absolute worst part is the lack of any attention in fish AI. The fish just clip through you and pay absolutely no mind to you slaughtering their fishy friends in front of their very eyes. In fact they will continue moving towards you! I didn't get through the entire game to see if sharks/sea/turtles/everything else that would be even remotely entertaining to spear was even possible. Yes, they simply just won't let you spear anything except like 10 fish.  Game dev. PLEASE ADD/Change -Blood and Gore -Let me kill whatever I want -Remove the treasure/coins (I’d rather count dots on a ceiling) -Add fish AI

7089	0	a	The playable area is very small, not much things you can do except taking photos and catch fish by one-click mouse.  Graphics are outdated, very few types of fish too.  Some tasks are extremely frustrating, for example. finding scattered treasures all over the sea. It has radar DLC to help, yes a 4.99 DLC, not even included in the base game. 
7090	0	a	Not enough variety in objectives/gameplay.
7091	0	a	Swim around and shoot fish. With a gun or a camera. Take your pick. Not the Manta Rays though. No avenging the Crocodile Hunter. Jerks. Chill out game with a pretty shallow amount of things to do. Whatever. It was in a bundle. Do not pay full price. Can I give this a thumbs sideways? No? Down it is then.
7092	0	a	What am i playnig and the main question is WHY THE HELL AM I PLAYING?! Gameplay:0/10 Graphicks:8/10 Music:5/10 The worst FPS (first person shoter) i've ever played. Thanks for your attention and remember to check out thee game. 
7093	0	a	Unless you're getting this game for free i would not recomend it. Altho the game was not bad per say, its not woth $15. The gameplay is boring and repetative.
7094	0	a	I found it to be more frustrating than fun. The graphics are pretty and the controls are ok, but I just can't recommend it because it felt more like a chore than something for entertainment.
7095	0	a	While I really like the concept and beauty of this game, it's just too slow and unresponsive.  This game is made for people who likes to fish and has never tried a video game before. Because this is as slow as fishing in real life.
7096	0	a	kinda relaxing game but to boring
7097	0	a	  I'm pretty disapointed in this game. Three maps in the core game.   -There's no variety in the fish from map to map, except that they add a couple new species each map.  -All the coral reefs look the same. The wrecks aren't really explorable.  -I was disapointed that I could go into the plane in the first map.  -The upgrade system is dirt easy to push through. You'll level up and recieve some kind of upgrade available. But everything is already available, and the icons they show, most of them don't exist in the upgrade window (like scuba tanks). -Once you get the highest hold our breath underwater upgrade, you wont have to go up for air again. You'll get it around the second map.  -In the third map, there's a mission to catch as many fish as you can within 5 dives. So you have stupid amounts of air to catch all the fish in the ocean. But you can just catch 1 fish and then dive up and down five times to complete the mission and move on. To be clear, one mission in the first map has you catch as many as possible in 10 minutes. I caught 130 fish. so yeah...  Just dissapointed. Was expecting more to it is all. Glad I won it in a giveaway.
7098	0	a	Not worth the money.
7099	0	a	Glad it was free. Horrendous
7100	0	a	Depth Hunter 2 is an underwater hunting game, allowing  the complete experience of the spearfishing extreme sport!   How about no?  - Average graphics, poor animations - amateurish menu  - relaxing music, sure, but after 2 minutes you'll mute the game  - trivial gameplay, is basically an hidden object game 
7101	0	a	Bad. Pretty sure this is a mobile game ported to PC for a quick buck, at least it very much feels like one.  Despite having depth in the name, there's no depth whatsoever to the game. It's doing the same thing over and over again mindlessly without explaination or reason.
7102	0	a	thIS GAME BE BALLLIN ::plpookliok IN5ANE GRAFICS
7103	0	a	This game is exactly the same as Depth Hunter 1. What a rip-off.
7104	0	a	It makes sense for this game to exist; deep sea hunting is a cool idea. The game itself fell very short of the what I feel it set out to do. Bad controls, bad mechanics and bad interface design meant this game didn't make me feel immersed at all. Also it's very disconcerting to enter a nice casual, relazing game only to find the only thing you do in the game is harpoon cute little well-rendered fish. You can't seem to harpoon the more endagered looking animals so I guess that's okay. I got this game as part of a not-great bundle and I still don't feel like it was worth it. 15 mins of gameplay max... unless you really like to click on fish under a time limit.
7105	0	a	My tags for this game are  http://store.steampowered.com/tag/en/scammers/  and  http://store.steampowered.com/tag/en/Bait%20and%20Switch/  . The developers aren't exactly jolly human beings.  My high-looking playtime is merely attributable to collecting the silly cards, to milk this piece of horse ♥♥♥♥ for all it's worth -- which is not much.
7106	0	a	This games features great graphics in a beautiful environment. However. The environment is very limited. Even with the 3 different locations.  And in regards to gameplay there is about 2 hours.  With that in mind. This game doesn’t seem completed. And just released at a point in time where the developers ran out of time or didn’t want to work on it anymore.  If I had to make a list of the things in this game I would make better. Then the poor UI and lack of character animation would be at the top.  
7107	0	a	Hit a game breaking bug 1 hour in and the developer's solution is just to start over. Not worth my time for an underwater hide and seek game.
7108	0	a	I don't know how people can sit through these missions. they are the laziest most boring and soul destroying missions you could possibly make. even the textures are horrible.
7109	0	a	Atleast better fish A.I. than Call of Duty Ghosts.
7110	0	a	A game clearly with little thought or effort put into it. You primarily take the role of a scuba diver sent on a series of (unexplained) missions to spearfish and collect treasure.  Gameplay and visuals are serviceable; no game-breaking bugs. Very 'cheap' looking interface and menus.   Not much to be found here.
7111	0	a	The game looks outrageously good. The whole vast underwater sea setting is so good to look at that it feels very serene. I guess it is easier to make a beautiful game when it is underwater. The problem however comes from the gameplay. The only challenge comes from trying to stay awake while playing. This shouldn't be a game on steam, it should just be something that you do on your ipad/iphone while you wait at the doctor's office. There really is no gameplay to speak of. You swim around endlessly underwater while harpooning countless fish with a hand held harpoon gun (lol) while finding treasure items on the seafloor. It's like one of those point-and-click treasure finder games where you have to click around screen and find all the items, but instead of still images you actually get to do something, albeit not much. I was blown away by how beautiful everything looks. I've never seen underwater graphics in a game look better. It might have even been better had they not included the horrible treasure finding part. It isn't good when you are alt+tabbing out to the game's store page on steam to see if the game has any real objectives or other things to actually do that are fun. It also might be the smoothest running game ever. It's too bad there is really nothing fun to do, just swim around and fight off the sandman.  Mr. Sandman, bring me a treat. Engaging gameplay with fun objectives can't be beat. Both of which this game has none of.
7112	0	a	I had more fun writing this review than playing this crap. The game is absolute goat ♥♥♥♥! Makes me throw up inside. I wish the refund option would have been out before i put in these wopping 8 minutes into the game. GG will review if no refund
7113	0	a	BIG MISTAKE TO BUY THIS GAME!!!!! REFUND MY WALLET PLEASE.

7118	0	a	looks good but is not good. buy it if you are really bored and feel like wasting your money. wish i made a better choice.
7119	0	a	idk what this gam is i got it in a pack for $1 and it came with 4 other games but not worth it
7120	0	a	Not worth buying. Its not worth 15 euro, if you want this game i would recommend waiting for this game to come on sale. I mean srsly 15 euro for a game that might be funny to play for 20 min???
7121	0	a	Holy ♥♥♥♥♥. I don't know if game of the year awards have some opposite, but this should have it. So friggin boring i can't even tell. I don't even know who will want to play this. Maybe elderly couple or some children.
7122	0	a	A quite boring game about destroying the underwater ecosystem of third world countries. You literally kill 100 fish in ten minutes, that is more than one person needs in a day. Also the treasures are lacking in diversity and not enough gold is represented in this game. Don't tell PETA but killing fish is probably the most fun part of the game.
7123	0	a	[6.5/10]  The graphics and sound are nice. The gameplay is relaxing, but repetitive. There isn't much content. I had most of the achievements before all of my card drops. There isn't much replay value unless you happen to regularly be looking for a relaxing game with extremely casual gameplay.  I would like to give it a neutral review or a 3/5. Maybe someday Valve will give us something better than the primitive thumbs up/thumbs down.  Depth Hunter 2 is [ossibly worth buying if it is deeply discounted and you are looking for a casual game or if you find it in a bundle that is worth buying for the other games in the bundle. tl;dr: +Relaxing gameplay, nice graphics and sound. -Repetitive gameplay without much content or challenge.
7124	0	a	This Game has poorly designed controls and a bad ocean/diving simulation. all in all, this game gives you a feel of 'you are moving in outer space', rather than swimming/diving underwater, where ocean waves and the sea water would give some sort of friction and ocean waving motion. this Game does not capture the 'Feels' of diving/swimming, its unrealistic and simply not worth the money.  The Sea Evironment in this game is way too 'dumbed down', it does not contain much of any sea creatures and underwater landscapes to be seen, it provides the worst kind of lazy evironmental design, the fishes looks unrealistic, the other sea creatures behave strangely and have bad bodily motion.  This Game lacks depth and has no player game play progression for the players to enjoy, explore and achieve.
7125	0	a	This game is really boring. Despite good graphics does not have any advantages. Control is difficult and tiring mission . The game pretty ok , but not for this price
7126	0	a	I can't recommend this game for a few reasons.  1. It's way to simple, Even for a casual relaxing game, it's just way to simple  2. It get's boring very fast, after about 10 minutes I stopped playing, but I'm more of a FPS gamer than Casual anyway so I guess it depends on what you like.  3. There are hardly any fish, They all look the same as well, you would expect for a diving fish spearing game there would be a lot of this but unfourtantley that is not the case.  4. Now this is really stupid, They added DLC for thing's what should already be in the game like the treasure hunting radar, that really should be a upgradable item.  While the game had them problems it had a lot of good parts to it as well for exaple the graphic's are decent, it's really relaxing and would be a great game for a man who is married and is suffering from blue balls, and it's would be a good game for a child, no violence, no bad language.  Overall I would say it's a great game for it's price, but the DLC just kind of ruined it for me, but hey, it's still better than Call Of Duty: Ghosts fish AI 
7127	0	a	If I didn't get this game for free I would be quite infuriated, it's so simple it hurts. I hardly played the game and I feel like I covered over 90% of the content in the 20 minutes or less that I played it for. Personally, I would give it a 10 out of 100 just for that alone.
7128	0	a	Expensive game for it's content!  Boring sandbox game with few missions. The graphics are okay but the game it self is very boring. It feels great however to swim around in the Ocean of Thailand.  This game is perfect for the senior fisherman but the gamers that want action and explosions should not buy this game!
7129	0	a	Mobile game at best, got it as a joke gift.
7130	0	a	The controls are just... no.
7131	0	a	Looks neat, but can't play because there's no remappable keys or joystick buttons. The developers have said this is 'On their to-do list', but since that note was 2 years ago, it's probably safe to say it's abandoned.
7132	0	a	This game is pretty terrible. You have exactly three things to do: take pictures, shoot things, and swim around. Massive waste of time, and seriously dull.
7133	0	a	I wish there were a 'depends' recommendation option for this.  For people familiar with the Amiga classic, yes I reccomend this - for nostalgia if little else. It's billed as a HD version of the original. It's not. It's a copy of the original, but not a totally faithful copy. The feel is fairly different, including but not limited to:   In the original you were limited to 8 directions for throwing the ball. Speedball 2 HD has some kind of auto-aiming which I think is worse because it is requires less skill.  Substitutes never seem to run out (you had 2 in the original and after that you had less players)  The AI is worse - it practically ignores the scoring multiplier and the stars (AI is a lost art form in modern gaming)  There are other things that can be annoying. Player auto selection can be infuriating and unpredictable. It is also buggy - sometimes the highlighted player isn't the one that moves - and not as responsive as the original. Then there's the bugs with achievements and cups (hint: never exit the game immediately after winning the league or champion's league) and the fact this game feels more like a grind to get the best players than the original where I felt a bit of skill could work against far superior teams.  It's OK. It's not a classic like the original. Despite being a very similar game with HD graphics, it seems to be missing the soul of the original game and they've made changes based on making the game easier when easier isn't always better. If there were a bugfix release with a few improvements, I'd change the recommendation to a Yes. It's just too flawed for the moment.
7134	0	a	If you love the original Speedball 2 then don't get this. It will ruin your memories.  This is a terrible 'HD' remake of the game. It is actually lacking in some features the original had, like the manager mode. What it also is lacking is any difficulty at all, you will easily steamroll every team in the first two seasons, except when you suddenly play a team that is completely maxed out when you still have very low stats.  What this game also lacks is any decent graphics. Sure, they are 'HD', even though you only get to choose from 4 basic resolutions. Sorry laptop users. But they look terrible. Bitmap Brothers games were known for their slick, stylish graphics and this game almost seems to make a mockery out of that. To add insult to injury the game is locked at 29 FPS, making it difficult for me to play for any length of time due to eye-strain (as if the graphics weren't insulting my eyes enough already).  Then finally you would probably expect an HD remake to have online multiplayer. Nope... Sorry guys. All this remake offers over the original is the higher resolution/horrible design graphics. That's it. No Manager mode, no online multiplayer, no challenge, no point in buying this. Oh did I mention the game crashing, save file corruption, playing teams with identical outfits to yours making it impossible to tell them apart (and then crashing after the match), terrible intro 'video', lack of the awesome original soundtrack...  I could go on but this should really be enough for you to make your mind up. Avoid like the plague.
7135	0	a	Preamble - I was an avid Amiga owner and at the time a fan of pretty much anything involving Renegade or Bitmap Brothers.  This? This is a missed opportunity.  It's the laziest port I could possibly imagine. The original parts of the port - the new character models and the stadium graphics are the kind of quality you would expect to see from work experience placements, not a decent studio. There has been no attempt whatsoever to update the game with modern effects, playstyles or really much of anything over the original game save a couple of powerups.  So it's not a new or expanded game; it's a faithful conversion of the original, right?  Well, no. It's not a very faithful or interesting remake either. The parts retained from the old amiga game appear to be a few faces and still shots (like the winning/losing graphics and the team portraits) which have either been resized and given the blur treatment, or traced very horribly. Worse, these scaled up and blurred originals contrast garishly with the new player graphics and other elements, making the whole thing seem like a poorly stitched-together hack job.  The gameplay is at least loosely faithful to the original, meaning that the players are feel hard to control at first (a fair complaint to level at the original and one that sadly hasn't been improved), but they've actually managed to make the original - which gets better with practice - worse, in that it feels very floaty and unpredictable off of the ball, and simple things like catches that would at least act consistently in the 'miggy version are almost impossible to pull off as the timing on performing a catch and/or a slide seems way off.  I would've hoped - since they were departing from a flat conversion by so much - they would've taken the extra mile and applied more interesting effects on the player field, and actually made a smoother analog-friendly movement and control scheme (GASP! Seperate out catch, throw and tackle buttons! Put aftertouch on the triggers or bumpers! ZOUNDS!) to actually play to the strengths of this PC platform rather than bringing all the problems of having to cater to a userbase mostly having one button joysticks.  Eh, too much work it seems.  So... Graphics? Miss. Gameplay? Miss. Sounds? Well, they nicked a bunch of the original ones but chucked some other stock effects in there so I'm going with miss. The gym interface is slightly better I guess. Hard to screw that up with a mouse you would think.  Don't bother. Play the original on an emulator instead. You'll get a more consistent and coherent experience, and if you take a moment to scale the emulator surface at least everything will look equally stretched and blurred.
7136	0	a	This is an awful remake of a great classic game, I recommend playing the dos verison of Speedball 2 in DOSbox over this.  The controls in this game are just awful, press down and your player may go down or just some other random direction. When the computer is control of the ball, press the action key and your player may slide tackle towards the computer player or away from him. I question whether anyone bothered to test this game before releasing it.  Save your money and buy something else
7137	0	a	Initially I liked it, but once Id comleted it once (too easily) it lacked any spice. I no longer reccommend this game, as the once existant support, vanished.
7138	0	a	I bought this because it is a game whose Amiga version I loved and played so much.  It is a game that shouts for an online mode, which it doesn't have.   The Solo Career mode is far too easy and when a bug deleted all my team going into the seventh season, I decided to quit it for good. I already wasted my money. I'm not doing the same with my time.
7139	0	a	HORRIBLE.  I was a huge fan of the series, I had my amiga 500 and the 2 original floppies of this wonderful game.  What remains of the original game in this lousy remake?  The sound effects, nothing else. All the rest is ♥♥♥♥ed up. The game feel, gameplay, atmosphere and even some cutscenes (like the violent images of bleeding team mates when you knock out enemy players or the team cheering after winning a game) are gone.  Don't buy this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t hoping to find a remake of the original game with a better graphic (which anyways looks childish and ridiculous)  Just check the other reviews, most of the people who recommends this crap is either new players which have no idea of what this game comes from or completely braindead people.  Don't buy it.
7140	0	a	Got this as part of a Humble Bundle, and it was the sole reason I bought it.  Well, needless to say it's a complete mess. After playing through the tutorial (which is hidden in the options menu, by the way), I got the jist of the scoring system. While constantly trying to put my newfound training to use, I quickly realized that running diagonaly makes the player or AI carrying the ball virtually invincible to most tackles. The AI on the player side seems to know nothing about offense or defense and bumbleclucks its way around the arena while the AI throws the ball at bumpers, stars, and somehow teleports the ball around the arena at unpredictable intervals. (And at one time, right into my goal. Hooray for cheating!)  The power-ups system is nice, except for the part where it's practically useless. I can run faster... Until I get sacked 2 seconds later by a tackle spanning about 10 feet. There also seems to be a complete lack explanation as to what in the apple sauce they do. A purple negative sign? Armor on the ground? A can of... Something with an S on it?  This game had a lot of promise - and I'm sure 23 or so years ago the original was fantastic - but this one isn't.
7141	0	a	I'm not quite sure how it's possible to take a game that's almost 15 years old and make it look worse but Vivid Games do. It's higher resolution, sure, but all nuance of the original is lost, sprites look comical, pitches ugly and it's even hard to tell where the goalmouth starts and ends. Instead of starting with a team that looks like a bunch of nerds your starting team are now randomly cybernetically enhanced. All 'New Art' motivation for purchasing star players is lost. All players are now a mish-mash of badly redrawn features from original characters. If you enjoy looking at clunky photo-fit faces with glued-on moustaches and noses that line up with mouths perhaps one in ten times (once you see this you can't unsee it), you're in for a real treat.  Graphics aside, the game is still fairly solid. The on-pitch gameplay is basically just a port of the original with no attempts made to revamp. Game mode differs in a few respects, some good, some bad, but nothing is going to make up for the god awful look of the thing. If there was an option to use original graphics I'd probably be able to recommend this. As-is it's really just a curio for fervent fans of the original. Something to pass the time, to agonise over how what could have been and to highlight just how incredible the original really was.
7142	0	a	Terrible game! The controls are godawful, I get that it's a remake of a classic, but come on! Fix the controls! Skip this one and play the original. Much better game!
7143	0	a	This is one game where you should listen to the reviews... I disregarded everything I read because I figured nostalgia would compensate.. I was wrong. Don't waste your money, even if it's on sale.
7144	0	a	Imagine the original Speedball 2... now imagine it slowed down to a snail's pace, with a choppy framerate, ugly looking sprites and sub-par controller support. That's this game. Avoid at all costs, it's more of an HD ♥♥♥♥-up than an HD remake.
7145	0	a	awful 'update'. Difficult to control and not anywhere near HD. Stick with the old version and get yourself Dosbox.
7146	0	a	Speedball 2 provides few retro thrills but remains undeveloped. It has zero additional team features, including functioning online play, which results in a lack of replay value.
7147	0	a	Expected more stylish (they have no style at all, unlike the original speedball 2) graphics and better animation. Plain horrible. You've been warned!
7148	0	a	I played the Amiga version many years ago so I had great hopes for this game. But it fell flat because of bugs and all sorts of odd things which shouldn't be in a re-make to modern standards.  Don't buy!
7149	0	a	This game is okay at best, until you reach the intergalactic cup. The difficulty spike there makes the game stop being fun fast.  It's also worth noting that for a supposed HD remake, they really messed up. I own the original version, and in my opinion it looks better, sounds better, and, most importantly, PLAYS better.  Not recommended unless you really want to play Speedball 2 and have no way to get the original version.
7150	0	a	If you know Speedball 2 on MegaDrive/Genesis, don't play to this one. Controls are HORRIBLE ! Completely hasardous ! Guys do stupids thing, you pals don't help you, and you can't win enough money quickly to buy super players...  I go back to my Genesis...
7151	0	a	Unplayable. An absolute mess. Even for £1.00 this is a rip-off.
7152	0	a	What a disappointment. I didn't hesitate to get this game and I suppose it's only £5 down the drain so I'm not that upset about it. It's more that fact of what they've done to one of my favourite Amiga games, or haven't done. It has a little bit of the feel of the original but not much. Real, real shame. 3/10 and thats for the 20% off sale price!! Don't let nostalgia get the better of you like I did.
7153	0	a	When the AI decides that your 2-star team has to face a fully trained 5-star team, you know there is something wrong. The progression is absurd, and the same goes for the gym system. Even if you dump thousands in your players, the overall performance is still pathetic. You're basically facing an arms race, losing dozens of games by a 200-point difference just to get a few dollars and buy players that can actually handle a tackle or two. I have not enjoyed this.
7154	0	a	it's like Bill Laimbeer's Combat Basketball but not funny
7155	0	a	Game is almost the same as its ancestor. I hoped that it would be much better at 2014 .Nostalgia just couldnt override the negative feeling i got playing this game.
7156	0	a	What the hell happened? What should have been a shoe-in for an amazing game, somehow got smashed and mashed in it's HD makeover. It looks great, and on the surface, everything SEEMS okay, but the controls man, the controls have taken one too many hits, leaving them slow to react and a bit of a general fustercluck.
7157	0	a	Given multiplayer support for this is local only, you'd expect at least some work might've gone into the menu interface to make it usable for gamepads. It's really not. Once you've finally gotten into the game, it turns out that there's nothing to recommend this over the original. You would've thought this would be an opportunity to make a couple of tweaks, but if anything it feels worse than the original. Lazy lazy port.
7158	0	a	This game is Just so hard to control and the AIs are too hard to beat  Speedball is a great game but not this time. If you want to play GOOD Speedball go to the internet and play it as online game it is better than this.
7159	0	a	Do not buy this game unless you're a Speedball II groupie. The AI is hardly present. Your controlled players swap randomly. Even the the Sega Genesis Version I own has less flaws. Really really bad UI at the Gym (where you upgrade your player's armor).  Actually this is a total downgrade from the original version. If you are interested in this game either try buying it from ebay or use an emulator to play it. You will have more fun.
7160	0	a	Speedball 2 is great, Speedball 2 HD is not.  Bad collision detection, very imprecise controls, anti-ergonomic interface and menus, boring graphics - which is a shame considering it's originaly a bitmap brother game - make this game an overall highly disappoiting experience.  Furthermore, it's very buggy. Actually, it's so buggy that during the tournament matches I faced my very own team. How is that even possible?   So, I was playing my team against my team played by the CPU. Obvisouly at the end, my team won and at the same time my team lost. And the game crashed because this situation didn't make any sense.  I would have prefered the original game rather than this so called broken remake.  Don't let the nostalgia trick you to this trap.
7161	0	a	Thoroughly appreciate the effort. But the original Amiga version still plays better. Keep up the great work. Meanwhile, think I'll load up the emulator once more.
7162	0	a	Played 35 minutes and it crashed after i beat Steel Fury on career mode and it keeps crashing when i try to reload my career game.
7163	0	a	Meh, i remember playing this as a kid and playing it now im feeling super frustrated at the lack of skill realy needed to play this and the frustrating gameplay, Im gonna try to give it some more time but the character auto select is nice at times but super frustrating when youu're chasing a guy and you switch to the goalie, completly letting the goal in. Ai is okay, there aren't any issues aside from the randomness of the game, one strategy i use consistently fails and then i try something by accident and i score. IMO its a fun game but i feel like theres not a lotta skill in it and it seems to be random. I'll update when i get more hours into it tho
7164	0	a	Some people say that video games cause violent behaviour. Well Speedball 2 did with me as I wanted to punch my monitor right in its flat wide-screen face as it trampled over my memories of a great game.  All the fun of the original seems to have been lost and replaced with a ton of frustration. The controls and ball physics are terrible and the one thing they could have updated from the original: online play, they haven't.  If you remember the original, avoid it. If you don't, avoid it.
7165	0	a	I really tried to like this game. I'll admit it was fun, and even, almost, satisfying at times. But the poor controls and finicky gameplay mechanics made it really hard to play. It just felt like bs everytime the ball wasn't thrown in the right direction or even not at all. If you can get past that, there is some fun to be had as the season structure is addicting to play, albeit short. But it wasn't enough to keep me from giving up on the game.
7166	0	a	Complete waste of money, can't play because I can't change the screen resolution, have tried doing it through the game properties and still no joy. To have something as simple as this not working in a game is a joke. Should of checked reviews before buying, was an impulse buy and thought it would be a good blast from the past. The old version was awesome and it worked, this does not.

IMO its a fun game but i feel like theres not a lotta skill in it and it seems to be random. I'll update when i get more hours into it tho
7168	0	a	Ehhh, I just don't know about this game, it's frustrating to play.  The tutorial system wasn't as extensive or as explanatory as it should have been, pretty much just hit the basics like movement and passing and such. I jumped into Career mode first and didn't really have any idea what I was doing. The ball and the players were flying all over the place.  What really broke this game for me in the first 10 minutes was the way your players were switched. It's disorienting when you have no idea which player you're controlling on the team and where he is when you switch. In theory, the game switches to the player who is closest to the ball when you don't have it. Problem is, it does it so suddenly that it gets confusing. A lot of the times it threw me on the goalie when I thought I was on defense and all of a sudden my goal was unattended.   The game can be a real pain in the butt to play when you don't have control over the proper things. I just can't play it.
7169	0	a	Disappointed, if you like the original then go play that version. This version has lots of bugs, controls don't respond until you realise that your controlling a different non-highlighted player. Throwing the ball is hit or miss (usually miss) and doesn't seem to do what you want. User interface for player management is 'Fancy' but lacks depth and ease of use of the original.   Overall not worth the £1 I paid for it. Shame on the Bitmap Brothers for letting this be released.
7170	0	a	Got this as part of some Bundle.  Buggy, glitchy game with enemy AI that cheats and player team AI that onl stands around, the controls do not work sometimes, forcing you to stand still while the enemy tackles you and robs your ball. Hate this game so much, i think i would rather remove it from my library than keep it and let it tarnish my collection. Waste of time.
7171	0	a	Hell no!  First of all it's a very cheap game (down to -90% on sales). Second of all, it looks very nice and is overall polished, stable and well presented. It's kinda nice and might even hold you for a while with it's action, fast loading times and menus and some wit and humour here and there, but rest assured that whatever this game does halfway well, Mutant League Football did miles better back in the old console days.  Why so bad? Because you control your team in a way where you move one player and the AI 'controls' the others before changing the player under your control and moving the player you used to control somewhere less usefull. The AI for the opponent's team does a decent job, much much better than yours so i really don't understand why my defenders are sulking in the corners, midfielders trying to tell their ♥♥♥ from their elbow from lying face down while the attackers are usually urinating in the opposition's corners of the field. Occasionally one of them is thrown under my command but given their position and relative uselessnes in pretty much any situation, i think it would be better if i stopped playing and gave full control to the AI.  The three attacking players can sorta tackle/pass the ball while rushing forward after the initial face off, but after a few seconds good luck telling what's going on. It doesn't even matter if you're winning by a 100 spread or losing, your control over your team is equally puzzleing.  AI teams are coompetent enough, they try to tackle, score goals or hit bouncers or whatever else to score points. They look coordinated. You can beat weaker opponents by tackling the crap out of their players and occasionally outsmarting the goalie in the rare cases you go 1-1 on him, but if you ever score off a passing play it will be a fluke. Most matches are a cluster♥♥♥♥ of mashing the single control button (yes, one button passes, shoots, tackles) and having no idea if your attacker will pass or try to strike the ball into the goal.  Sometimes the ball teleports randomly to a player on the opposing team if you or the opponent fumble the ball and it rolls to a lonely stop all alone and unloved and unkicked for too long. Your idiots will NEVER be in a position to take advantage while the opponent AI will usually score a goal within seconds.  And why the hell do i have to control the goalie?! If i'm trying to chase down a runaway opponent the last thing i want is for the control to be switched to the goalie! Because i'm human and it takes me a moment to realise that control has changed and during that time i'll end up telling the wrong player to move. For example the goalie will dive left and leave the goal unprotected when what i wanted was for a defending player to dive left and tackle!  Why are you even reading a review for this game? Why does it even exist?? The 90s 'classic' was better than this, yes it actually was better despite the bar being much much lower back then and expectations and standards being lower as well. Speedball 2 HD couldn't even beat an average game from the 90s, that's how uninspired, uninteresting and completely ♥♥♥♥ it is.  Play Mutant League Football, or one of the Sensible Soccer series or Kickoff. All those games only let you control one player on the team with AI controlling the rest and switching occuring at sometimes awkward times. But they were fun and controls worked perfectly (they haven't aged well though). Beat your head into goo with an Atari ST 520 or a frozen cheeze, just don't go near Speedball 2 HD.  Developers didn't care enough to keep Manager mode where you at least don't have to play, and they couldn't be bothered to code online multiplayer where two friends could at least laugh and cry together as they fail to control their teams.  There is nothing to redeem this game. If you were to throw your own poo at the devs windows, it would be a waste of poo.
7172	0	a	Trash.
7173	0	a	Oh my God. If you were considering getting this because you had it on your Amiga and whenever the name is mentioned you instantly think of how cool it was, the music, the atmosphere, that nutter selling 'ice cream!' and so on, and you would like to retain those memories than try as hard as you can never to so much as glance at a screenshot from this abortion of a game. I wouldn't even be sure that whoever made this execrable garbage had even seen the original. 5 seconds in and I knew how bad it was going to be and I want to cry
7174	0	a	While this game is very fun and I've had a lot enjoyment it has caused just as much frustration. This game commits the same sin as many other games by mapping all actions to one buttion. This game would be made infinty better with more presiction controls. Speedball 2 needs more then the hd treatment. If this game was updated rather than just 'HD'ing it would find a great audince. Controls for switch players would be nice as the auto switching was confusing and inconsitiant.
7175	0	a	 Speedball 2 HD  is a sports game with simple controls, and yet enough complexity of gameplay that it  could  be decent. Maybe the original actually was a decent game; I wouldn't know since I've never played it. This one, though, has issues. For one thing, each Speedball player has several stats that can be raised to improve their performance, but only two of them are actually explained in the tutorial, and the in-game info sheets shed no further light. Some stats seem self-explanatory, but others are decidedly not, making this an annoying oversight. More problematic is the fact that you directly control one of the Speedball players on your team, but the game automatically determines which player you control, and switches you around so frequently that it can seem impossible to keep track of what's happening and where you are, and react quickly enough (sometimes control even switches to a player who's off-screen). That single gameplay flaw is enough to make this game too frustrating to be worth playing.
7176	0	a	Thought this would be multiplayer online. Local play only. DOH! 
7177	0	a	If you are here looking for the remake of a great game I'm sorry but this is not the place. It does not have the feeling of the old Speedball2 both in mood (visual and audio) and playability.  I'm open to remakes, even those that change gameplay or story, but this is not a different, remade game, it is a copy of the old game with less appealing style (to me at least) and bad controls.  The main reason I do not recommend this game is the controls... if feels glitchy, static and non responsive.
7178	0	a	Hell no. Glitchy, subpar design, terrible UI, and a tutorial that doesn't work. Glad I got it as part of a bundle.
7179	0	a	Well, it goes like this (might have spoilers):  1-) Wow, my team sucks, everyone kicks my ♥♥♥ on this game. 2-) Ok, now I'm getting better. Slowly, but better. 3-) Why the hell is so hard to save money on this game? 4-) What's the reason of putting lvl 5 teams against a lvl 2? Just to receive a major whooping for sh**s and giggles? 5-) Ok, this is SERIOUSLY boring... 6-) After so many meaningless seasons, I think that I finally have a chance to turn the tables. 7-) Well, that was close but I can certainly win next time. 8-) GAME OVER?! What the hell is wrong with this game?!  Overall, it's not the worst game ever but it's certainly one of the most tedious and sadistic that were ever created.
7180	0	a	This games is not exciting at all. Unpredictable character movements, dumb physics, uncontrollable characters. Sum: annoying gameplay. If you can get this game for free, then you can run it to get a few trading cards. Otherwise this game is totally worthless.
7181	0	a	Trash.
7182	0	a	0 out of 10. Slow, ugly, bug filled and poorly designed. Download a SEGA mega drive emulator, download Speedball 2 and play that. A much, much better game and its free. Or like me, you can just get it on your phone.  Dont waste your money here.
7183	0	a	The automatic switching of teammates makes strategy impossible and an overall frustrating gameplay. I do not care for it, but may be bretter to play with some friends if they care to play.
7184	0	a	Lets be honest, it is nothing like old nostalgic games. Better find emulator for those classics. 
7185	0	a	
7186	0	a	this game sucks ♥♥♥  play the original instead
7187	0	a	You'd think it would be impossible to make a bad pass-the-ball game but with dreadful controls and auto-aim they've managed to do just that! This would've been a poor release even in the mid 90s.
7188	0	a	I changed the resoloution to 1080p and my TV started making a crazy high pitched static noise. I turned it off and back on then it was running normal again... I personally like top down sports games, but there was no tutorial, I only learnt from seeing what the bots did. There's some weird circle in the middle you can get 2 points from hitting, and you can get a ton of points from scorring a regular goal. There's some sort ofpower up that the bot used, it knocked out all my players.... my players can't seem to pass a certain part of the feild... Anyways the bot got 5 goals and then I raged on out.
7189	0	a	is bore
7190	0	a	This game has no way to assign specific controllers to players. No matter how I try to use my Xbox 360 controllers for the game, it stupidly thinks my Logitech G13's tiny little joystick is the controller even if it is unplugged.  This game is meant to be played with a gaming controller, not keyboard and mouse. It gets a NO vote from me until the devs fix this.
7191	0	a	1) Launch this stuff 2) Minimize the window 3) Get your cards 4) Delete this stuff 5) Never remember about it 2/10
7192	0	a	I found this game quite annoying :/
7193	0	a	Shitball 2 HD
7194	0	a	not worth $10
7195	0	a	Astounding, 20 years ago I would have recommended this game on the Mega Drive; I still have my Mega Drive &amp; the game. There is a manager option on the Mega Drive game, so this manages to have less functionality than it did 20 years ago. I also don't seem to be able to find the saved game file to do things like change names of my players; which I'd expect to be able to do with notepad or a hex editor when playing with a game this old. Apparently Steam don't like you editing games or so I've been told. Who the hell are Steam to tell me what I can or can't do with my game? Disappointed as I increasingly am by games on Steam. It seems you lose something in functionality, lose something from old games, and in return, get nothing from Steam. When will they realise that mistreating their customers will eventually lead to them losing customers? Only when we stop buying from them I suppose. I'd rather go Good Old Games.
7196	0	a	This is pants... Get the original from an abandonware site and run it in DOSbox. The original creams all over this.  Don't waste your money... It isn't even worth being free.
7197	0	a	There is no excuse to make a worse game with today's technologies and knowledge than it was more than 20 years ago! Terrible looking sprites, bad animation, bad ball 'physics', terrible controls, could have been a Flash game. Even the original Amiga version had a better feeling!
7198	0	a	i got this game for free, even then i still regret it.
7199	0	a	Waste of time.
7200	0	a	Speedball is one hell of a drug. Stay away kids.
7201	0	a	1 was clearly too good
7202	0	a	  ♥♥♥♥
7203	0	a	edit: Valve has now added an 'Online Multiplayer' tag to the tag pool, which they should have always had since the beginning. As such, since they likely abandoned this game the moment it was published on Steam, we'll never have to worry about the publisher ever adding the wrong tag again, ad the old 'wrong tag' is now the right one.  Old: Publisher lies about this game having online multiplayer by using the 'Multiplayer' store tag, when it is Local (Co-Op, the Valve designated tag for this). They even admit they are lying about it in the description, instead of properly labeling it to begin with.
7204	0	a	Football manager in really cool retro graphics. Still a manager game with a little bit of gameplay. Also the original looked way better than the HD ver.
7205	0	a	This game has too many bugs to be considered a finished product.
7206	0	a	This Game is so horrible, I would rather jump off of a 100 ft Cliff into a Lego Factory, swim in the molten plastic, jump into a pit of broken glass and lose my testicles then play this game any longer.
7207	0	a	FIRST THING, NO ONLINEE MULTIPLAYER!!!    Control are half broken, cant navigate the menu, when you type the name of the team, its work half the time, you enter a letter its go back in the menu.   The Graphics are cartoon instead of being cool like the classic ones.  The gameplay is fine but only if you use the keyboard.   In the menu its all broken, cant navigate, completly buggy!
7208	0	a	The basic idea for this game is really good (league system, character evolution, and rules of the game), but gameplay is really really bad: it's impossible to play decently with just 1 button to press other than directionals... Tackle, shoot, pass all in the same are really bad and you even can't choose WHICH player you want to use because AI chooses for you and mostly in a terrible way. My suggestion is to really avoid this game, not worth a single minute of time.
7209	0	a	I never played the original... I've heard it's some kind of classic. Nevertheless, Speedball 2 HD is not. Very simplistic future-sport simulator. Simplistic in manner of controls, game rules can be a little unclear at first. Punch everyone, toss the ball into goal, into holes in the walls, bounce it from obstacles.... it's all worth points! Confusing. The concept is fun. For a 15 minutes.. then it starts to get boring. Gameplay is very fast, most of the time it's hard to see whats happening. Then starts the button mashing. One button mashing. Theres only one button you can press (excluding direction keys). So... you can kick someone in the face (no possesion) or pass/shoot the ball (possesion). No other tactical options. Very quickly you will come to a conclusion that you could be playing something a lot better than Speedball 2 HD. Then, you'll switch it off and never come back. Sorry Speedball, i gave you a chance.
7210	0	a	Has nothing of what made the Amiga version so great. What a disappointment.
7211	0	a	They have taken Speedball 2, butchered it, r*ped the remains, and then butchered it some more.  If you don't know the original Speedball 2, do yourself a favour and stay away from this dreck. If you know and love the original Speedball 2, here's an incomprehensive list of what's terrible about this remake:    The graphics are in HD, yes, and there is a resemblance to the original. But: The colours are terrible and create a way too fabulous look and feel. At the same time, animations are as bumpy as back in the day, but without any of the original charme.   The controls are sucky. Just plain bad.   That not only goes for matches, but also for menus. Try doing anything in this game with a gamepad and you'll end up doing a lot of things you didn't mean to do.   It seems as though they have changed the gameplay for the worse. It's way too easy to win, which is partly thanks to a horrible AI. Also, I had the feeling that my players who should have been knocked out just kept going regardless.   The user interface is a mess. The gym functions are particularly annoying. Selected players' faces will be highlighted, but very subtly so, so you need to be extra careful not to overtrain. I didn't see any skill values in numbers, as well.   The music doesn't cut it, neither do the sound effects. But then again it would be hard to live up to the original.   All in all, a waste of time for anyone involved. Speedball 2 is definitely a game that would deserve a proper remake, and probably without 'HD'. But this one is not it.
7212	0	a	Championships achievements don't works + various minor bugs, yet no support from devs since 4 months.  Botched up port of the 1990 classic. The gameplay is exactly the same as 25 year ago, with jerky 30 fps anims. poor active character selection, and abyssimal AI. What was acceptable in 1990 feels below average today.  True to the name the game is in HD and you won't see any pixelated gfx, however the original game used a 32 colours palette with subtle shade and nuance to great effects, this release make a very poor use of the extended palette available and the new gfx have lost the famous Bitmap Brothers 'metalic look'.  During the match the game works correctly, and you can have some fun for a while, but there are small bugs here or there. For example you can win all your league matchs by a comfortable margin but from time to time your league ranking is n't properly updated to reflect your performances. This is a serious issue in carrer mode, as there is a good chance that over the 10 seasons career one of your season will be bugged.  A few modes have been added but overal there is a lack of attention to details. The gameplay is very unbalanced as most game are either too hard (sometimes) or too easy (often). There is controller support for Player 1 but not for player 2 :((, moreover there is only local multiplayer.  There are 20 peoples listed in the credits including 5 programmers and 5 for QA, but the result is very disapointing, and the lack of infos and support is a shame.  Certainly not worth the full price, some single player value may make it worth it on sale.
7213	0	a	Not worth the &lt;$1 price tag. I'm a fan of the original Amiga 500 (OCS) game and played it to death when it was new. But this is not even a shadow of the original in gameplay, graphics and sound. 
7214	0	a	(Ignore the time spent on record; I had this set up on a dedicated 'retro gaming' PC which was very rarely connected to the internet).  Anyway.  Sorry - I can't recommend this. It plays like a clunky old flash based browser game and has an incredibly unintuitive interface.
7215	0	a	Limited to 30 FPS. If you mute the music you also mute all crowd noise and the nifty floppy drive loading sound. Garish graphics. Can't really complain for 79p but I think I'd rather play it on an emulator.
7216	0	a	Very bad port... The original was better in all the way....  Vote 4
7217	0	a	I'm not sure how this manages to look worse than the 26 year old original, but it does with gusto.
7218	0	a	The AI is horrable.
7219	0	a	Violent sport video game set on a dystopian world where injuring an opponent is more valuable than scoring.  Apart from its brutality, I must recognize that the imaginary sport enables different tactics owing to its various method to gain points and its difficulty seems right to play a couple of main mode walkthrough hanging around the other mode to get more achievements, which overcome the simple controlling system: arrows for directions and another button.
7220	0	a	Okay you want a review? let me tell you how I feel about this game and why I gave it a down-vote. so you might be thinking 'wow this guy has so many hours in this game, why would he down-vote this game?' well the game itself is fine. let me break it down for you.  9.5/10 game. 1/10 community. 2/10 ranking system.  Back when this game first came out I would 10/10 recommend this game. nobody really knew what they were doing and it was just as much of a party game as mario kart or gang beasts, etc etc. it was a blast and super hilarious... then people starting getting good. eh no biggy. we're still just as silly but now we actually see ourselves getting better. as time goes on the community gets more and more competitive. now its at a point where if you buy this game and you're playing it for the first time, you probably will just get frustrated that you are so bad compared to everyone else and corrupted by the mindset of the community. its about like csgo. but if you have the patience to fight through that and find the good people, go for it.  the next thing i want to address is the poorly designed ranking system. its OK, but could be A LOT better. now i don't want to complain but if you want your players to take your game seriously in a competitive scene, its only fair to them to give them a fair chance. so let's say you queue up for a match, and you're like lvl 20 ish level, rank prospect 2 in the new season. the problem is, the ranking match ups are all over the place. its like, win 4 matches in a row 'oh man you must be a god at this game, lemme just go ahead and match you against people 5 ranks above you' then you get your ♥♥♥ handed to you twice and you're back down to people 2 ranks less than you etc etc cycle goes on and on. and besides, you shouldn't even be getting matched against these people in the first place.   I was all-star level last season, i've played this game since launch and have had a ton of fun. but i have so many issues with this game as far as ranked and community goes. but the game itself is fine.   SO TL:DR... don't get this game unless A you're willing to work very hard to get good because god forbid you ever just play for fun, or B, you have good friends to have good times with in the game. i'm telling you, its toxic. don't go in there. also the AI is trash. k bye.
7221	0	a	Game was fun, this last patch has destroyed the competitive mode. Its randomly throws people in it. They have forced bad maps into the competitive matches and its just ruined the spirit of it all. They have changed the POV settings and the speeds are off somewhat as it was during Seasons 1 and 2.
7222	0	a	the matchmaking is just so horrible.
7223	0	a	Let me get right to it. Rocket League is an amazingly addictive game with a lot of depth. Just when you thought you know how to play, other higher-level players will come and shatter that illusion. It also feels amazing seeing players pull off amazing moves, and then after several matches you try looking badass, failing each time, until it does work, and you get progressively better at it. It's a textbook 'easy to learn, hard to master' kinda game in that regard. The controls are responsive, and it also looks amazing visually at max settings. But... why a negative review then? Hear me out, don't down-thumb like a sheep because I don't 'like it'. Because I do. I love Rocket League, my play time is proof of that.   Then what is it? On the surface it's very simple, but deep beneath it's a very troubling issue: Psyonix has announced a crate system á la Counter Strike: Global Offensive and Team Fortress 2. And as far as I'm concerned it's literally the worst timing to implement such a controversial system, with the recent outcry regarding the CSGOLotto-gate and the two little sh*ts Martin and Syndicate, as well as Valve's involvement in all this (going as far as 'advising and consulting' these shady websites). Psyonix was - and to a certain extent still is - a developer that I hold highly because of their pro-consumer attitude with a lot of effort put into free post-launch content. To keep affording their contributions, they already sold DLC with new cars and other cosmetic items, but I didn't mind. Why didn't I mind? Because you already knew what you'd buy, it's not a surprise. You can spend the 2$ on a DLC pack and know exactly what you'll get.   But with this new upcoming system, it's  literally  going to be a lottery. And I know what you're thinking, 'lol he uses the word literally wrong'. No, I mean it. It's literally a lottery. To make matters worse, while regular gambling is regulated at a minimum age of 18, even children can play Rocket League. Crates will be dropped 'free' randomly during regular gameplay, but you can only open that crate if you buy a key. Which essentially means it's literally gambling: you never know what's in a crate unless you spend the money on a key to open it. Maybe it's a great and rare item, maybe it's a duplicate you already have dozens of. And to top it all off, you won't even be able to sell your items on the Steam Community Market. 'We don't want it to make prone to exploitations', they say. But that's bullcrap, it's only because of the console versions that they won't - or can't - implement a selling system. So what happens when you've spent money on this lottery only to have many duplicates? Who knows, probably you could just use the current trading menu with five items of a certain class that convert to one item of a higher class.  This is not just about you. This is also not just about disabling the crate system and just playing the game as we used to. This is about a morally grey system that can take advantage of vulnerable people for uncreative, greedy financial benefit. And I don't want to take part in this, and neither should you. But I expect thumbs down and ignorant comments.
7224	0	a	This game is without any doubts one of my favorite games ever played, I'm playing it since it was released and I enjoyed every second of it with my friends but in the last few months competitive mode has been completely ruined, probably by the last patch. As soon as you play private games with your friends this game is pure FUN for hours, but if you ever want to take a break like trying a 1v1 competitive match, your fun will end there. In the first match, if you are veteran, probably you will find a semi-pro that you will just overwhelm 3-0 after 10 seconds and he will forfeit. In the second match (talking as a veteran) you will surely find a legend or so with at least 400+ hours than you and of course you'll never be able to win. This game just needs improvements on the matchmaking, then it will be just perfect, but as it is now I can't recommend it to everyone.
7225	0	a	I absolutly love this game. FLipping rocket cars playing soccar is so much fun. The new rumble update is one of the most fun games I have ever played. I Sadly cannot recommend Rocket league because of an unwelcome part of the rumble update. Previously all cosmetic DLC was the fair price 0f $2-4. In the rumble update they have added TF2 style crates you must unlock with keys. You cannot recieve the crate items in random drops. Car skins from crates have already skyrocketed to $15 worth of keys if you want to trade with other players. What would have been $2 if sold by Psyonix as one car, is now $15 unless you open a crate and the rng gives you the car you want (You could easily spend more then $15 opening crates and reciving nothing you want). Even if you were the luckiest person ever and recived every single item in both of the current crates for 1 key each, it would cost $30: Significantly more then the most expensive DLC you can purchase for the game, which is the soundtrack Vol. 2 at $6.  As long as this anti-consumer system is in the game I refuse to purchase any Psyonix products. I would have purchased the new cosmettics as a DLC pack, even if it cost more then all of the other DLC.
7226	0	a	Uninstalled.  New EULA is a joke and ♥♥♥♥♥ all over us, introduced Microtransactions because they couldn't make any decent DLC. There's a huge stigma about microtransactions in games, especially in a game you paid for, it's understandable from a F2P game, they need some sort of income to keep the game free and to keep making content, But when a game you buy decides to pack up some little DLC's into various crates and gives you the chance at getting the particular DLC you want, that's dirty. What could've become more DLC is now locked behind a freemium gambling paywall, with the real DLC I could chose what I wanted and happily pay for it, now I'd have to buy a key, then use that key on a crate, and hope that I get the item I wanted, if not, I'd have to buy another key, potentially spending more money on useless items, than I would on an actual DLC pack I actually wanted, not fun.   This game was fantastic, the graphics, the feel, the cross-platform, now it's just another soon-to-be F2P money ♥♥♥♥♥.   To sum up the EULA, Psysonix has complete control over you, they can sell your data on, They can take the game away from you and deny you access for life if they see fit. I'm not even going to mention that they deny access to the game unless you agree to their new EULA... oops. ♥♥♥♥ you Psyonix.  Absolutely Disgusted.   EDIT: I made a few mistakes when reading the EULA, review has been changed, the game is still going in a bad direction though.
7227	0	a	Best matchmaking ever! My team: 100 hours overall. I'm semi-pro, my friend is pro. Opponents: 1600 hours overall. There are rocketeer and master.
7228	0	a	Rocket League is one of my favorite games ever released. The depth that the game involves is absolutely incredible. But, the game has major flaws that 'patches' have 'addressed'. The biggest one being the ♥♥♥♥ poor ranking system in the ranked game modes. You win 3 games, still same division, you lose 1, down a division. This attempt at a ranking system is so god awful that it makes me and everyone i have ever discussed it with want to jump off of a bridge. And yet the devs release this huge patch claiming to fix everything by resetting everyone, when really all the patch was, minor fixes and then covering up the flaws with new items and personlization ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. gg psyonix.
7229	0	a	Althought incredibly fun this game has two huge issues.  The matchmaking is poor, facing the same opponent or having the same teammates in ranked is awful! Especially as one of the communities many trolls is always the one you get put with twice in a row (this occurs frequently).  Onto the trolls... The report system is obviously fake. The game is full of them and running into some of the same guys constantly proves no banning takes place.  They could at least not matchmake you with someone you just reported...
7230	0	a	Game is Great. The EULA is stupid. In this day and age the publishers that be think that template EULAs should be used on all platforms.  Publishers, The EULA, that was added on 2016/09/08, states that  I (the consumer) cannot use the license on more than one PC even though I own a license to use it on the PC platform. Compare section 2(1) against section 5.1.b. In otherwords you are trying to make the license be bound to 1 computer. Section 2(1) makes sense in that I have a license on/with a single platform. But section 5.1.b does NOT make sense in this day and age. Espectially when the distribution platform is Steam. Steam controls/limits only 1 active/running game at a time. AND when the game is paired with Steam Cloud which easily migrates saves between one computer and another I cannot believe that you added section 5.1.b. *  #2) is that a EULA was added POST-SALE. I was not presented with a EULA at the time of sale therefor one CANNOT be added after the fact especially when it bans my use of the software if I don't agree to the license. e.g. I should not be able to use the newly patched version but I should be able to use the version prior to the patch that added the EULA in-game. Also I have no recourse, on the Steam platform, to use the previous version that did not require the EULA. (Steam's backup system doesn't work like a traditional backup system.)  #3) Also Psyonix in section 6(7) says they can decide if your account loses access to VC/VG with no mention of any recourse the consumer can take to refute the claim. e.g. they are the police, judge and executioner.  #4) Lastly Psyonix is specifically removing a right Californian's have. See the bottom of section 8. Thus this cannot be good for the consumer if they are removing a consumer right.  All in all this was a bad move by Psyonix. It is a bait and switch licensing in terms of #2. You cannot even exit the software without agreeing to the license (unless you use Task Manager. You cannot even use Windows' ALT-F4). That seems a bit illegal doesn't it?  *Post updated on 2016/09/09 0207 because I re-read the EULA and it indeed says 'at the same time' I swear it wasn't there the 1st time I read it. I apologize.
7231	0	a	Well, its fun. I wont deny that. But... Its not enough, that the dlc`s with different hitboxes on their cars cost by now twice as much as the original game. No. They have to go CS:GO and sell you keys for 1$ for crates you will rarely see with content you dont really need. so if you just drive your car, its a good game. but if you're a person who wants a full game, if you buy a full game, you should definietly keep your hand off.  Pro: fun with friends you have flying rocket cars  Con: Expensive DLC's Expensive keys for crates only 5-10% of new content is availiable for 'free'
7232	0	a	 I used to love this game and play it daily until the Neo-Tokyo patch, and here's why:   I'm ranked Expert in this game currently, but am only really as good as most Veterans.  I got my girlfriend the game in the summer sale, and play it with her on a smurf account that is ranked Pro, she is Semi-pro currently.  Unfortunately matchmaking is so bad that we can't have a good game and she doesn't really get the opportunity to play with people of a similar skill level to the learn the game, as the big recent patch appears to have completely f*cked up matchmaking. We will join a usual 3v3, and will end up with a team that is Me (Pro), her (Semi-Pro) and a random (Veteran etc.) and then will be against a team with an Expert, or a Legend and an Expert, and even Rocketeer ranked people.  Just now I was playing this with her with our team comp as Pro, Semi-Pro, and Veteran, against 3 Veterans. We were winning 3-0 as our teamwork was pretty good. One player leaves on the other team, and someone hiding his rank replaces him. This guy then proceeds to juggle the ball 3 times in the air before scoring and just generally being very skilled in the air, and then goes on to beat us 4-3 (all the while my girlfriend is still only just learning to hit off the wall and very occassionally has the guts to try an aerial). So thanks to matchmaking the opposition gets an insanely good player who carries them, and as such we lose the game.  Now this is not just some system that recognises that I am very good for my smurf rank and so giving me decent competition. Even when I play on this main account (as I said earlier I am expert rank), I have very often been put against teams made up of semi-pros and pros while having veteran team mates, and the newbies have been absolutely slaughtered, making me feel extremely guilty that they have had to come against such an unfair team.  All-in-all, if you are already experienced at this game, you will tend to have fun, maybe have some stupidly easy games thanks to poor matchmaking. If you are new to the game or looking to get it for the first time and will need to learn the ropes of wallcrawling, aerials etc. then just don't bother until matchmaking is fixed, as you will just get annihilated and frustrated that you aren't being given the chance to learn the game amongst people of a similar skill level.
7233	0	a	I played this game for over 70 hours just wonderfully. Then after some update in late 2015 it became unplayable for me. Constant disconnects and rubber-banding plague every match I've tried since then, and I've tried many hours as my time played shows. I have tried every method I could find to remedy but nothing has worked, even tried a different ISP and couple differents routers (even though I play many other online games without any problems). The problems lie with the game and poor servers, as many many people can attest. Once the game is playable for me once again and this won't be a negative review.  P.S. Microtransaction BS is BS and should be handled like BS, flushed away and forgotten.
7234	0	a	I love this game SO MUCH! But last update just COMPLETELY RUINED RANKED. Just cant play with two semi-pros in a team, which will just leave in the middle of the match...
7235	0	a	Was good and recommended game before but now when they added tokyo map in ranked all went to hell.
7236	0	a	While it is a fun game, I am finding that the casual game arenas are very very unbalanced. While it is uncompetative, I have been going up against some unfair opponents. My second game was 3 rookies vs veterans. Didn't make the experience too fun. I still plan to play a little bit of the game, but I have a busy schedule as is and this game doesnt sit high on my game list.
7237	0	a	With the latest update named 'Rumble', Rocket League got a new microtransaction system, yeah, because we love microtransactions in a game that we paid for, with this new system you can't only purchase the items that you want, you need to pay to open a crate and hopefully you will get what you want (you can view the drop chances of the crate before opening it), if you don't get it, keep purchasing more keys to open more crates like in a F2P game.  I would be more than happy to select what i want and pay for it without problem.  Also they now require you to accept a stupid eula to play the game that removes a lot of rights that you have as a consumer.  Yeah, it's a good game, but psyonix shouldn't be doing this.
7238	0	a	this game would be so much better if they fix matchmaking. also lately 80% of my games i join i instanly lose because either i join at 0:01 left or my teammates forefeits and it actually counts as a loss to me which should not happen because i didn't even drive 0.0000000001cm
7239	0	a	Playing this game about 500hours right now and what i can say is, that the ONLY 3 Things are important to play:   THE NEW MATCHMAKING GETTING YOU F*****! GUYS surrendering after 1Minute! And the best of all: Everyone watch the Scoreboard. There are so many moves not giving you any points while saving the goal by stop the ball in the midfield. BUT EVERYONE calls You a NOOB! So, don´t play this game, if you are a peaceful, not flaming Teamplayer. You will get sad!  And the Story never ends:  Playable Guys ---&gt; HIGH PING! Unbalanced Match ---&gt; NORMAL PING!!!!!!!!!!!  FU GUYS FROM PSYONIC!!!!!!!  DID YOUR JOB VERY WELL!!!!!!!!!!!!
7240	0	a	They got rid of breathing underwater. will make positive when this is fixed
7241	0	a	Good game but matchmaking is horrible.
7242	0	a	Great Game, but after an update new terms of service gives away personal data. Cannot go back to non-data hoovering version of the game.
7243	0	a	Cool game ruined by match making.   Pros -Lots of fun when you're evenly matched -Easy to get started but difficult to master -Lots and lots of stuff to earn -Nice leveling system with cosmetic rewards  Cons -Match Making is awful -Did I mention how bad the match making is?  -Constantly queued against people who are leagues ahead of your skill set. One really good player can completely wreck a game of newbies.  -A high level player can queue with his brand new friend and it puts them in the low players MMR so the high level player just wrecks everyone. Results in really lopsided games.  -No penalties for leaving games so people quit constantly resulting in lopsided games with AI controlled players. Seriously people quit after the first goal is scored when there is still 3 minutes left in the game. So weird.    Until they fix the match making and punish leavers this game will continue to be extremely frustrating.
7244	0	a	Yeah, nobody asked for microtransactions.   I don't need another gamble simulator in my videogames. The way it was handled before was fine. Took one update and one stupid decision to make me drop one of the bests games out there currently.  Shame on you guys. If you're into stupid online gamblin and silly hats that nobody ever will pay attention too, this is your way to go now, next to CSGO and TF2.
7245	0	a	Solid game but ranking system is useless. It's not much fun going up against pro gaymer neckbeards when you might only want to play for a couple of hours week
7246	0	a	Love the game but today they added microtransactions - loot crates that you are forced to buy keys if you want to open (they do NOT drop but the crates do). It's pretty silly that the die-hard RL flockers are trolling my review saying that I can just shut the system off - except for the fact that you still run into people all the time who have too much money to blow with decals and other cosmetics that I know for fact i'll never own without shelling out my hard earned cash. It's sad that Psyonix has resorted to a forced gambling system to make extra cash and I will no longer be playing until the keys are included as rare drops.
7247	0	a	Matchmaking is terrible. They tried to fix it, but just made it worse. I don't understand.   Also don't forget the Linux and Mac release that'll likely never come out.
7248	0	a	Awarded for most balanced game of the year. 50 hours ? Doesnt matter! UR ENEMY OVER 1000!!!! ALWAYS
7249	0	a	This WAS the best game ever made. Then the rumble update came along and added a crate system.  Tl:dr IF you dont give a ♥♥♥♥ about your money? And not about Companies that are trying to rip you off? Go ahead and get this game its great! IF you do? Stay away.  I have been completely overrun by the reddit community for bashing this games Crate system.   For anyone who does not know about it?  Drop crates. Buy keys get items that are Crate exclusive and look way better than anything in the DLC will probably ever look like.  Dont see the problem?  1 key costs 1.49€!§$)(/!§ what ever currency. You get ONE item. And you have just like in CS GO a rare chance to get what you actually want.   One DLC currently containing a car and its rims costs 1.99€   So whats there to yell about? You can trade right?   RIght.. This system is not intregated into the steam market. So you can only trade keys (obviously)  So to get that great RARE item you want? That is only rare due to a rigged system made by the Dev of this game. You are probably going to lay down 5-10$   5-10$ for one item you want. VS 1.99$ for two, for 1.99 you also dont need to look for a trader that has it. And you wont possibly be scammed Ever.  So why am i getting bashed for this opinion? Simple.   THE system is Optional they yell at me! No it is not. Optional would be if you can turn it completely off. AKA not see other peoples great skins from this rigged to ♥♥♥♥ system.   You can turn off getting crates (WHY THE ♥♥♥♥ WOULD YOU? That also gets rid of items you can trade! WTF?!) And the buy keys button. You will still though see all the cool ♥♥♥♥ you now dont have access to unless you pay into the RNG system and pray to RNGesus.  ALSO The team making ♥♥♥♥ for this system actually could have worked on more great DLC that they previously sold too! Instead we now have crates that will get good ♥♥♥♥ (cause it makes them money) And probably if we even get DLC it will never reach that quality standart! AWESOME! MUCH OPTIONAL!  I like to have my games complete. And since i actually paid for this game I feel like i have a right to complain over a system that makes it impossible for me to complete the game unless i pay Triple A title prices for DLC.   Lets talk this through.  There are about 15 items in a crate  thats already IF you have insane luck and never get duplicates about 15$ taking a key price of 1$  BUT you wont have that luck. Lets say you need to spend twice as much cause RNGesus was still nice to you. Then we are now at 30$ for 2 cars. Paintjobs. A rim and a 'surprise' item.  OH what if you trade? As already mentionened Just like in CS GO rare ♥♥♥♥ wont sell cheap. So you are looking at probably 10$ or a little less for JUST THE CAR!  THIS is not a F2P title I paid for this game. So why in the world do i get systems that even got hated on when they released on F2P MMOs!?  Overwatch did it better already. We have an example how to make crates suck a little less. And yet they still go for the worse system  Why? Appearently to fund Esports. Though we have no actual numbers of how much goes into the esport scene. And nor does this in anyway make this system better since they could create normal DLC instead and still make money.  Psyonix. I wish i could refund the entire damn game and get my time back i wasted in it.

7260	0	a	EDIT: Having attempted to find a fix again, and attempted to play the game again, I've decided to change my recommendation. I can only go on my experience and, in my experience, the game is broken. Unplayable. Shame.  ORIGINAL REVIEW: Recommend with a HEAVY caveat. There's a bug that some people experience (it's out there on Google) that's been around for well over a year and doesn't seem to be getting fixed. It causes the game to act severely laggy no matter how good your connection is. When I say 'literally unplayable', I'm not mis-using the word 'literally'.  The game is super fun. I got a couple weeks play out of it before it started acting up in the aforementioned way, teleporting and rubberbanding to the point where the game is worthless. I have no connection issues, packet loss, and the game registers a decent ping. None of the fixes Google has turned up have sorted this issue.  The game is definitely worth the price *IF* it works for you. If you get this bug, however, you may as well throw your money out of a window.
7261	0	a	Great game, but i,m uninstalling out of priniciple.  The reason being, they have just monetised it in the last update.  You can now buy keys for what looks like certain a combination of car, decals etc.  So you have to buy the game and then also have the option of buying keys.  Come on developers, get a grip, do one or the other, not both.  Either release the game as free and have the in game buying, or revert it back to how it was.  I feel cheated having purchased this, and had I known this was going to happen I would not have bought it.  I would also like to add, this will prevent me from buying another Psyonix Inc game, congratulations guys, I suspect I will not be alone.
7262	0	a	New updated ♥♥♥♥ed the game. Dont buy unless like getting buying keys with real money to get skins.
7263	0	a	I wish there would be a 'mixed' button but because theres not i have to go with 'not recommended'. Dont get me wrong, its a great game...but since their last update they brought crates and keys in the game...what a surprise. And with this....economy. i know that it is just cosmetics but still having gambling crates in a 20€ game is not really great where you have to spend a lot of euros just to get that one item. And i also know you can trade them but then....economy: people already trading their csgo keys for those crates so what will people want for those mystery decals for example ? Knives? Even without steam market ppl will try to make money with it and im worried about it. We dont need more currency or rng-based crates...sad

7266	0	a	Okay let me be honest here, the game is amazing, the gameplay is perfect and it very competitive. The developers keep adding great features and follow feedback, but I will still downvote this game due to its community.  I have never ever seen such a toxic community, even counter-strike has a more helpful and supportive one. The people here are extremely harassing and ruin the experience of the game completely. I'm sorry psyonix, but please have that harassement report button do something.
7267	0	a	Would really love to recommend Rocket League (9/10), but this game has connectionbugs which i havent seen in years.  Living in central europe with a speed of 70up/25down and no lag/packetloss in any multiplayergame i play, Rocket League seems the exeption. Heavy Rubberbanding in almost every game with an ingame ping of 20-30ms.  Even driving a straight line seems impossible, the car is jumping left and right like crazy.  So either the Servers are potatoe and are located somewhere in a thirdworld country and not in europe or the game does a terrible job of routing connections. Both are equally bad and one of it must be the case, since i can definitly say its not on my end. All drivers are up-to-date and can easily handle the game. Therefore NOT RECOMMENDED

7281	0	a	Rocket League is an amazing game with great potential, that is ruined with terrible servers. Even with low ping, the server will spike you with huge amounts of lag, and it's not just me that's having this issue. It'll be the entire server at once, which although hilarious (when everybody misses a stationary ball multiple times, you will laugh).
7282	0	a	Matchmaking is cancer ffs... im Veteran (= about lv 30) and got matched with legends and masters... for example 20 matches in 100 are balanced... (and there are still smurfes)  this games is cool but. there's no fun if u play without the chance to win. playing only with frieds is the only way to have some fun at least.
7283	0	a	Nice game some bad servers, Rocket League team lies to customers on forums and no changes happen even after acknowledging their mistakes.   Because of that its a 1.5/5 I would have given it 4/5 if it was not for the devs and staff actions along with some server performances.
7284	0	a	This used to be a great game to play with friends, but the latest update means that if you're not the same rank then there's little point to play. The new change means the highest ranking person on your team denotes the matchmaking party. So a new guy, an avg guy and a high ranked player get matched against 3 high ranked players for example. This just means you get stomped on most games. My friends and family have since stopped playing and we used to game regularly each night. I regret buying all the DLC now since I can't play with my buddies. Real shame.   Casual mode suffers from the same problem, even worse so since if you score a goal most of the time someone quits the game, so someone else quits and its mostly playing with a mix of AI and new players as they enter.

7291	0	a	Rocket league is the only game where additional content hinders more than it helps every single time. The game itself is perfect, the boost, the cars, the ball motion, hit boxes, etc. But they keep forcing players to compete in silly stadiums designed by people who dont play the game. It was fine when you could choose to play at these quirky levels, but they just integrated them into the normal game modes. They added a like/dislike option to help control which maps you are prone to playing, but guess what, IT DOESNT WORK AT ALL. So, once they stop forcing me to play at wasteland every other game competetive or not, i will recommend this game again. Til then, suck my balls psionix. - Someone who has actually reached Champion rank and has over 800 hours in this game
7292	0	a	The game is good, really fun and enjoyable... But the community is where it all falls apart.  Let me put it colorfully...  If the seabed was Rocket League, then the community would be the stinking trash that we dredge up... There's nothing wrong with the seabed itself, it's beautiful! But the garbage scattered all across it pollutes it and makes it ugly.  It's for that reason that I can't recommend it, as my overall experience has been frustrating due to the rudeness and aggression of the community.  But hey! Maybe i'm just getting too old!  Game - 8/10 Excellent! Community - 3/10 Very Poor Sportsmanship!

7295	0	a	Don't buy it yet if you are from the Middle East, it lags like crazy at the moment and I wish if there was a LAN mode atleast so we can compensate the lag and play in a LAN party while they fix it.  not worth the money at the moment until they fix the lag.  Edit: the lag is worse if I choose the nearest servers (Middle East) and still with my Cable connection in the city, 100Mbps. I know my ISP is really bad (Etisalat Telecomunications) but comparing the latency between Rocket League and Overwatch for example, I always get a consistent ping in Overwatch opposed to what I get in Rocket League. It is an amazing game but with really crappy servers for the Middle East.  Edit2: Game still suffers from online lag, I am still waiting for a strictly LAN mode.  Edit3: After almost 200 hours, my level was reset to 1, now I am a smurf! Thanks Devs for your crappy update style!  Edit4: Forget Edit3, they restored my level, but now I can't log in, when you can't log in to rocket leauge servers it doesn't matter what level you are cause you can't FREAKING PLAY!!  Edit5: This game is now just too random, most of the time, No servers online, later if it was possible to join, I stay at joining forever, this last update ruined the connection.  check this screenshot  http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=822049852   Note: I think the more I complain, something happens that makes my account unable to que or join games.... hmmmmmph I wonder why.
7296	0	a	Only purchase if you have friends to play with and have fun. Otherwise, it's not worth a penny due to the quality of matchmaking. CS:GO is a delicacy compared to this game. Even with the terrible community.  Won a match and downranked:  https://i.gyazo.com/5ba9d1afbbbee9aa0d2c185a20871eb3.png   https://i.gyazo.com/c4aea9e8bac37e27a4aa113ce7b4b3b5.png   And it doesn't just end there. No matter how good you are within a team, you will rise or fall depending on whether you win or lose. Carried a game with 3 goals and 1000 points but lost? Too bad, you will downrank because of your teammates. And you can't really blame them. This leads to incorrect ranks and horribly unbalanced matchmaking. Ranks should be determined by YOUR skill, not your teammates'. The ranking system is an absolute 0/10. Imagine a ranking system consisting of two rows of code:  lose_elo (when you lose) gain_elo (when you win)  Because this is Rocket League. Worst matchmaking I've ever encountered.

7298	0	a	You blocking my country ip and now nobody cant play rocket league from iran ! give back my money ♥♥♥♥ing theft ! Shame on you
7299	0	a	I love this game. Played it while it was free. SO. MUCH. FUN.   But I can't recommend it, particularly for Iranians, like me. This game won't work for you. Rocket League blocks their servers in Iran. It can't connet unless you're using a proxy, which will increase the ping to uplayble levels.   So, if you don't live in the handful of countries who are boycotted by RL servers, by all means, buy this game, it's awesome and fun! But I won't, and never will, since I can't play it in its current state, unless they allow Iran to use servers.

7304	0	a	This is a great game but I wouldn't recommend picking it up now. The community is growing worse and worse, by that I mean they are 'toxic'. Lots of abusive messages when you make one slight mistake, which you will make from time to time, following by deliberate own goals etc.  Psyonix have a report system in place which does absolutely nothing it seems. It has no effect on the match you are in, sure you can mute the chat but you still take a loss and rank down. If the system is retroactively banning players then you don't notice a difference. There are more people wanting to ruin your fun by the day it seems.
7305	0	a	the worst match-making system ever. i'm getting crazy all the time. it's even worse than cs:go
7306	0	a	This is a very good game and very fun but due it's poor matching maker I can't recommend it...
7307	0	a	I love this game when I can play it. Right now the net performance is so bad I can't play in western Canada. If you buy it I'd recommend watching your play time and confirm the network performance is good enough in your area before you cross the 2 hour mark and can't return it to Steam anymore.
7308	0	a	yall need to fix the hit boxes and the latency issues!
7309	0	a	1/10 edit to 3/10  review will stay this way till  -matchmaking is fixed  -gravity is fixed  -player community gets better than CS:GO (still have seen inprivement there, not that I expect it tho.  Have just about nothing good to say about this game anymore than private games with just friends. played 50 ranked games won 30 lost 20 and ended in a lower division than when i started? Makes no since and would have to mean i go down on wins.. fix game. Then it might be worth a re-review.  Edit: Seemes to have improved to get better matchmaking (more even experince) but you alaways go down a rank if not 2 when losing but half the tiime you do no rank up for a win? Still seems unbalanced. Overall it does seem to be getting better tho.
7310	0	a	This game needs to remove any non basic maps from ranked, seriously.
7311	0	a	Great game, fun to play. Do not agree with loot crates in a pay to play game however. Lost a lot of respect for the Devs for that.
7312	0	a	Okay, let us be honest. The game mechanically? Pretty much flawless. While it has a seemingly infinite skill curve, you are quite able to jump in and just enjoy the game. There is no problem there.  Where my issue enlies the community. It has what I would describe as your typical eSports community . . . which means it is full of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and people that make you wish you were playing with them in person so you could bash them over the head with your keyboard. You will be accused of AFK botting while having over half the team's kills, people complaining that you didn't block a single shot when they've never defended all game, all sorts of bullcrap. Since the single player has little to offer, having to deal with the hassles of other people is the only limitation to enjoying the game.   So basically, here's the question: If you would be willing to recommend a game like League of Legends or DotA2 to people you know based on the community, would you? The answer to that is no, I couldn't, and the same applies here. I may play it every so often because it is mechanically beautiful, but the community reminds me why I don't stay around long.

7316	0	a	This game has the most terribles matchmaking I have ever seen in a game ever.   As a new player, every single match is againt experienced players where my precence on a team means that it automatically loses.
7317	0	a	The new content in the recent update is aweosme, but the skill reset has made it really boring. Most games are a gross mismatch of level, and skill, which means either team wins by a huge margin. I used to love playing this every day, but now most games are super frustrating or really easy.
7318	0	a	Worst physical engine i have ever seen.
7319	0	a	its a fun game but the matchmaking is pure cancer! if you are trying to play SOLO standard you will still end up with 2 prospect 1 in your team eventough you are challenger 2................ great experience 10/0
7320	0	a	Well.....Rocket League is a game that asks you to give your soul and ''some time'' from your valuable life to reach α decent Rank. So far, we're good and i'm satisfied with the game BUT if you win 9000000 ranked matches and lose ONE only ONE the answer that you get when the match is over is DIVISION DOWN!!! and this is not the only one, to get a DIVISION UP message you have to play....well i lost the counting but who cares.  In other words my opinion for this game except the ranking system(if they fix it then i will change my review) is positive but because of the previous NO!

7326	0	a	Rocket League is all of what you can see; rocket-powered RC cars playing soccer, and recently, hockey and basketball.  When teams are balanced and everyone knows how to play, it's amazing, challenging and loads of fun. Sadly, this is a rare event. Most of the time you'll either be assigned the world's derpiest team, or the opposition will be comprised of super saiyans and jedis. If you're particularly unlucky (about 15% of the time for me), you'll end up with both.  Speed boosts are awesome and essential for high rank gameplay, particularly when 70% of players above Pro Rank fly around like birds and I'm flopping like a dying fish. When I use it, boost seems rather underwhelming at 24 or less, and getting more can be painful due to the nodes littered around the arena don't respawn fast enough for the gratuitous use they get.  Getting to a higher rank is rather tedious when you get to semi-pro, and worse when trying for veteran. Experience requirements seem rather high for no reward other than getting a higher rank.  But what truly ruins the fun of the game, is the completely broken match-making system. Team balancing in Rocket League is simply 'put players in here till 3 each team'. The game will FREQUENTLY put much higher ranked players into the match, obliterating the hopes of the opposition and spoiling the fun for their team.  TL;DR: If you're looking for a fun and balanced multiplayer game, look elsewhere. If you want to play against players with loads more experience than you, on a team with no goalie, for little reward; then welcome home.  Until the developers fix the boost respawns and overhaul the match-making system, I don't reccommend this game, as it's very frustrating.
7327	0	a	Pretty entertaining game but its match making is truly horrendous
7328	0	a	First of all I would like to say to all the whiny ♥♥♥♥♥es saying their matchmaking is horrible 'I get matched with higher rank'. You have no idea what bad match making is untill you play CS:GO.  A game should be easy to learn and hard to master and this is one of those awesome games.  If you dont like the challenge, you're most likely one of those sore losers that quit because they are losing and just simply wont get any better.. and here you are now.   *THE BIGGEST PROBLEM FOR ME AND MANY OTHER PLYERS IS THE COMMON LAG SPIKES WITH LOW PING*  Since I first started playing this game form a free weekend, I couldnt stop playing, it was that addicting and no dramas. Game ran perfect for 150 hours straight for me untill the new (Neo Tokyo) update came out.  Now I get (lag spikes with low ping) every day for the last week or so. Im not saying becasue of the update but as a reference.   Other players have also told me they have been lagging with low ping and nothing seems to be getting done about it so I hope the developers see this because it is now unplayable for me and many others. I honestly have tried everything to try and fix this but there is not much I can do from my end.     FYI this is on Oceiana Servers with Cross-Platform turned off.

7331	0	a	Game lags out. Alt-F4 doesn't work. Open task manager to kill. Restart game. Try to reconnect. Says can't connect to server. Try to join matchmaking again. I'm banned for 15 minutes.   As much money as people are throwing at these guys you would think they could invest a little in their servers.
7332	0	a	Let me start out by saying this is literally my favorite game on Steam. I say literally because it's true; I don't have a game I like more than this on Steam. I would also like to mention that I haven't played this in five months. Okay, a review now.  This is my favorite game on Steam. It's so much fun. The new maps really make this game fun. (I'm willing to exclude microtransactions from this review. That's not the point of this.) So, a new EULA was rolled out overnight by an update. That made the community upset. And some arenas in competitive really shouldn't be there. The community doesn't like some maps in competitive. And the microtransactions. The community isn't too fond of that. So the reason why this review doesn't have much structure is because I wanted to show just why   I  can't give the game a recommendation. And it's very difficult to not start raging at the devs right now. I've sent them so many emails, not even recieving a reply, about my issue. Error 67. I can't connect to any games. All I want to do is play online, which I'm unable to. (It was working five months ago, then it suddenly stopped with the Xbox cross-play update.)  I should repeat something: This is my favorite game in my Steam library. But I haven't played in five months.  I would like to compare my . . . 'love'(?) towards the game to sugar. (Maybe Steam doesn't like what I should've put.) If you've been having sugar for a lot of days, or months, in a row, and then suddenly, all the supply stops, how would your brain react? It needs that sugar. But there's pretty much no way to get that sugar. You start to develop sugar cravings, commonly called addictions, since you   need  that sugar. As mentioned before, there's no way to get that sugar. That metaphor sums up my feelings towards Rocket League quite well. Five months without the sugar of Rocket League is becoming too much.  I will delete this review and repost it as a 'Yes' for recommendation when I'm able to play the game again.

7337	0	a	I really enjoy the game but the south american servers are getting down a lot.  Playing on other countries servers it's horrible because of the ping.  Awesome game, poor servers for south america. (Brazil)
7338	0	a	Love the game, amazing atmosphere, great competitive matchmaking, the most perfect game I have seen so far.  Only complaint is for psyonix to add dedicated servers in China; Japan and South East Asia are very close geographically, but the I never get under 100 ping and often spike to 200-300 likely because of the firewall, so matches are almost always completely unenjoyable.  And to make things worse, searching for a match often (but not always) takes way too long, probably because I live in China, this mostly happens when I'm queueing with my friend who lives in the same city, I often give up after spending 30-40 minutes training while searching for a match and switch to another game.  I know psyonix listens to the community and am still active on the subreddit, it's one of the many reasons I love psyonix, I love the game but I sadly cannot play it properly. I will leave a negative review solely for the purpose of making psyonix do something about this, in which case I'd change my review.  I'd absolutely recommend it if you don't live in the following places: China, North Korea, the moon, the ISS and any other place outside the earth's atmosphere
7339	0	a	There servers have become very laggy. The ping is good but there is still major desync causing the game to be unplayable me my friends and I on PC. Looks like they cheaped out on servers so they could put more money into their pockets instead of good servers.

7345	0	a	The game is fun and addicting..............but the matchmaking is complete garbage. Pros: -Fun and Addicting - Great mechanics and idea -Lots of game modes and levels  Cons -Matchmaking ruins the experience for you by matching you with people two titles higher than you -Toxic community -SO MUCH DLC AND DLC ACHIEVEMENTS.  I would recommend this game but the idea of it being fun and addicting gets destroyed by the games you play being broken or the people being toxic.

7347	0	a	♥♥♥♥ING GAME SUCKS IT WONT LOAD FOR ♥♥♥♥ WTF IS THIS ♥♥♥♥♥TRY
7348	0	a	Love this game with a passion! But if you plan on playing this game by yourself and want to pair with another random expect to lose EVERY game. Their partner pairing is so upsurd it's ridiculous! Until they allow random matchmaking to be paired with other random matchmaking this game is virtually unplayable if you are solo queing. Other than that if you have a team of people and are talking via Teamspeak or Discord this game is right up your ally! If you are a solo player, avoid this game like the Zika virus! The game use to be amazing prior to the whole 'Cross Platform' was introduced meaning it's just a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ PS4 players drunk ♥♥♥♥ing around with their friends. Avoid until they make it PC only like they should have from the beginning!  Being cross platform is a decent idea but if I can't communicate with the opposite platform is means nothing more than a frustrating lose. If you are going to add cross platform you need to make sure that they can communicate with each other. Until then, the game will fluster with single player players.  *UPDATE*  Since cross platform, there are VERY RARE times that I come across a PC player. This game has evolved into a PS4 game strictally. Pairing you with PS4 players makeing player communication an impossibility! You can't talk or chat with your fellow PS4 teammate.   Rocket League is a PS4 game now, do not purchase on PC you will be an excluded person with no control over communications with your fellow players.
7349	0	a	Latest update brings a visual item microtransaction system, it'll be f2p in 6 months.
7350	0	a	Before I reason why I do not recommend this game, I gotta say this game is amazing. I have been playing for an hour or so and although I suck complete ♥♥♥♥ at it, the game makes me excited and the graphics look really good even on a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ computer. However... the only reason I do not recommend this game is because of the online features for the following countries:China, Crimea, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, Syria. Now I live in shanghai and I can play almost every game because of the decent internet here but before I purchased this game I had no idea online play was impossible in China. Rocket league uses google features and the all mighty great fire wall of China blocked Google a while back. I was able to connect to the servers using vpn but the connection simply wasn't steady. I was able to play a few online games with the lag and the games were still very exhilarating but I can still not hide my feeling of disappointment. I really hope the company does something about the servers just like many other gaming country has dealt with China because I know that without lag, this game can be more than exciting.

7352	0	a	Reasons why you SHOULD NOT buy this game  1. you can enjoy happiness  Reasons why you should buy this game  1. You think youre good. (you aren't) 2. You have suicidal thoughts and tendencies. 3. You don't really like when games work how they should. 4. You have a lot of money and it's just taking up to much space. 5. You think it will be fun with friends. (though it will tear your friendship apart) 6. You are just a damn moron.  No matter how good you think you are.... you aren't people are always going to beat you because of some stupid ♥♥♥♥in BS. Can you control it? no... not even a little so don't even waste your time. I personally love to hate myself everyday when I hop on for a few rounds and get off beause I'm seconds away from a stroke. Just please for everyone take my advice and do not even try this game, dont even look at it, beacause it really hates you and doesn't even want you to play

The only thing to do offline is play vs easy bots since all difficulty level is the same. If you are going to buy the game I would wait for a under 5$ sale because it is a good time killer with a group of friends. Thought I would add in that matchmaking for the game still seems off, lots of mismatches in most games.

7363	0	a	Everything about this game, as a game itself is perfect. The first game in some time that was able to keep me coming back, and did not stop being fun at any point. I was originally gifted this game, and went on to buy the collector's edition, as well as gifting the game to several friends.  That being said, I cannot recommend the game anymore after the latest update. The developers have added in a crate system which allows players to obtain cars and other items for your car based off a pool of rare items. Before the release, various community members convinced me this was not such a bad thing, since it simply allowed people to pay money for a chance to get an item they would like rather than waiting for the opportunity to get it from random drops, which happen at random after games.  I was content with this change until I read the details of the release notes. The crates contain items that are otherwise unattainable. Players must now spend money on crates for the mere opportunity to get the items they want. The DLCs previously released were enough for me, as I could be assured what I was getting in buying the DLC packs. But now, there is no consistency left. I cannot trust this developer anymore.
7364	0	a	Been playing since about a month after launch. Love, love love it, or atleast used to. At first I didn't mind the DLC packages, it was all aesthetics so there was no problems. Then came some bad maps, that were implemented in ranked for some reason, still not enough reason to be upset.   Then came the crates. What a great way to introduce a new form of toxicity to your game. To encourage people to pay you money to recieve things they don't even know if they'll want or not is just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Good luck playing solo without running in to the countless people farming for drops.  Sadly for now, it's time for me to take a leave of absense from RL. I really hope Psyonix realizes their mistake. I don't want Counter Strike, I don't want TF2 hats, I wish they just continued to do free, non dlc, no paid money updates like when they were in their prime.   But it's all about the money. Remember that kiddos.
7365	0	a	Amazing game, one of my favs... But I cant lvl up, all my progress is reset afther restart the game... (Everything unless the replays I save) If I change the paint or decals or any other items, It roll back to my lvl 31. I would like to know if someone else is having this issue. Thanks...

7368	0	a	This game was fantastic when it came out, But asoon the in♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed the 'Mad Max' Theme it has not made the game anyway challenging but rather not rocket leauge main theme in match making, oh i didnt forget about the new map as a Japan type theme, I like the main Rocket leauge map for competive but now i cant stand it, People reading this will think oh yer he just bad and hates it, But go into rocket leauge forms and even go on twitch and ask pros about it.
7369	0	a	♥♥♥♥ THIS LAST UPDATE! completely ruined the game for me. i usually play solo when my friends are not online and now the ranked matchmaking is so god damn unbalance it makes me want to kill myself! why would you add a new NOT NORMAL map into 2v2. why didn't you creat a new ranked game called stupid ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥ games with unranked matchups you ♥♥♥♥ suckers

7379	0	a	it was good at first but i guess there cutting there funding nothing but server lag and crashes when it doesn't lag
7380	0	a	Great game, but some of the worst competitive MM I've ever experienced in my life. I nearly have a brain aneurism every time I try to go beyond unranked MM due to the amount of absolute stupidity that occurs in competitive MM. Every kind of scum comes out of it.
7381	0	a	Let me know when they fix the registry issues (constant errors in ball interaction off of walls and/or vehicles, vehicle hitboxes are also pretty terrible), and when they properly divide the matchmaking system into teams and solo queues, because right now you either play with a teammate like its your job or you and a random play vs a duo queue who actually play together, instantly starting you at a massive disadvantage. Pros: was fun before too many people starting playing and taking it way too seriously, so the concept is fun, the community is just overgrown the developers and they clearly have no idea how to make a functional multiplayer matchmaking system work.
7382	0	a	Never seen a more rigged game in my life, anyone stuck in challenger knows what Im talking about! Fix your matchamking and maybe I'll come back 
7383	0	a	As you can see by my play time, I have played this game enough to know what I am talking about. I played this game since it's release on steam, and I had a good ammount of fun playing it, with a friend of mine. Then I became good at the game, and started playing by myself. Here is what I have encountered for the past several months, on ranked:  - Players that join simply to rage or curse at other players, and either don't play the game, don't focus, or don't play as a team;  - Players that won't let go of the ball, even if they don't know how to hit it;  - Severely unbalanced teams, usually resulting in a 4-0, 5-0, or similar result;  I am a programmer, and I can think of several ways of fixing each individual issue. If not completely, at least partially. However, since release, game devs have added nothing but new models, maps, gamemodes, and textures, all coming with an extra DLC.   - The cars still lack proper costumization - if you ever played a game with as many sales as this one where you could tune a car, you know what I mean;  - The match making is really bad due to the basic simplistic way they use to rank players;  - The gamemode options don't make sense 1v1 (is as good as playing real football 1v1 - 1 small mistake and the other player is running off with the ball, if they are as good as you) doesn't have enough players, 3v3 has too many, but has a solo option that prevents parties from joining, which is great so you can play by yourself and not face 3 friends and lose instantly, however the odds of finding 2 players that dont match the play style you need on your teammates in order to win are very high, and 6 uncoordinated people is just a mess, and 2v2 is the perfect ammount of players, but you cant play 2v2 by yourself unless you want to lose constantly by getting crap teammates and facing parties of good players.  In short, this game could bee great, if the devs fixed the issues with the current game instead of filling their pockets with money by adding more of what's already in the game - with the small exception of the hoops gamemode, which was great until we realized it had no space for movement. oh yeah, saving also doesn't get scored properly. That's in all modes, but on hoops as well.  In extra short because I started to ramble, don't buy this game. Have fun playing something that is actually improved on constantly and doesn't have a toxic fanbase.
7384	0	a	Too many trolls in this game. Absolutely stupid matchmaking. Ranks? Don't matter at all.
7385	0	a	  Ok seriously this game is epic and fun and cool and awesome and radicals but they don't have a boat skin??????? what ?????? really ok actualy this game is bad dont' support these devs that do nothing but neglect the game.
7386	0	a	This game is simply amazing. The gameplay is nothing short of brilliant and every aspect of this game is loveable.   However, there has been a significant drop rate for cosmetics as of late. In the past, I used to get drops every 1-4 games which is respectable. Now, I get a drop every 9+ games and, yes, I have counted.  What follows this change almost immediately? Drops of crates. Why? Why psy? I already paid in full for your game. I bought all of your dlc. Why do you have to limit me and shove crates into my face like CS:GO? This isn't what I expected from you guys.  Maybe if the drop rates were the same and the only items obtainable without crates are Very Rare rarities? I could probably understand that. Then, you can change the max drop rarity for crates to be Legendary although that would mean you would have to add more content...  I don't have any say in the content of the game and I understand that, but this is not what I expected from you guys and it's really disappointing to experience this with Rocket League.   GG

7390	0	a	The Latest Update Has Killed Rocket League for me. As you now play at the level of the highest person in the party you either have to play with strangers to be properly matched or your friends have to be the same level as you.  If you are levels higher in your party your pals get to play with people beyond their game. Not fun at all.  If real competition is what you want then this is great news. If you want to play with friends, forget it.

7421	0	a	CDN 21.99$... That's a lot of money for suicidal thoughts. But seriously though, this game is like an equivalent of the wheel of misfortune. You join a game, the servers spin a wheel seeing what they'll give you. You can get the awesome prize which is a semi-decent to a nice game or the most common prize, where you play with over 100-200+ ping, Against people who are 'matched' to your skill level, you can join a game with teammates who play like they don't have limbs, or you can join a game where physics will just get turned off and all hell will break loose. Most of the time the RNG gods come in and butt♥♥♥♥ your team and give the other team free unstoppable goals. I will say I have 15.3 hours on record, however I have played a lot more on the xbox and my friends account. Overall, if you want this game badly, save the money for something else unless this game goes on sale for like CDN 8$. Also one more thing, Europeans are the superior race because they sit on top of the servers so you instantly lose pretty much if you vs Europeans.

7426	0	a	This game is pretty fun to play casually but probably one of the worst games to play competitively which is primarily why I can't recommend. In theory, it should be a good comp game. The gameplay is mostly all skill and you have a pretty decent ranking system. However, you can't choose which map you want to play on so occasionally you get stuck with the weird ones that no one likes. The community is pretty terrible. Lots of insults are thrown around during the match and there is very little teamwork in the lower levels. Client and server desysncs can lead to a bunch of BS that you just can't account for. You may have made a solid hit but the server says nah. It's a pretty fun game if you can look past all this though.

7428	0	a	It's a fun concept, but something is bound to come along and execute it much better. In an online game matchmaking is key. This is all over the place as far as randomly throwing all skill level players together. I have never found three fun games in a row. That kills it for me. Every time I have to wait to find another awfully mismatched game, it makes me want to turn the game off.

7431	0	a	This game is really fun! However, their ranked matchmaking is utter ♥♥♥♥. They have no apparent reasoning for putting you against whoever they put you against, especially when it comes to rank. You'll have games with veterans against semi-pros and stuff like that. They need to rework the whole ranking system if it ever is going to be worth while.  However............ the game is still fun as ♥♥♥♥ and when you do well, you feel like you could kick anybody's ♥♥♥.

7439	0	a	I recomend this game for the people who arent going to play any ranked matches, but for those who are going to play ranked, I do NOT RECCOMEND this game due to its Psyonix's messed up ranking system. The ranking system for this game especially if you are in a party of 2 or more because it takes the highest ranked player in your party and find the same ranked team as that player. I would give a better reveiw if Psyonix fixed their ranking system

7442	0	a	This game is a weird social experiment, or a prank
7443	0	a	Hello, before I bought Rocket League I was ofcourse reading on come Reviews and all the positive rating amazed me. I started playing it few weeks ago and the game seemed really fun (Rookie, Semi-Pro). Once I reached level 'Pro' I found big problem about the game. I will explain you my story now: So after reaching 'Pro' rank I started playing rankeds. While I was unranked I was getting 75% of the game matched up against people that are up to 25 levels higher than me (Veterans, Experts), I thought it was okay so I kept getting lose to them until I got my first rank, I thought after reaching my first rank I thought I would be getting matched up against people that are same, or simmilar skill than me. I was wrong, with my rank around Prospect Elite I was still getting matched up against people same rank as me, but HIGHER level than me, so that means they have more hours played &gt; better skill than me.  I think developers should edit Ranked Matchmaking System a bit, so it will only match up Rookie vs. Rookie, Semi-Pro vs. Semi-Pro, Pro vs. Pro, Veteran vs. Veteran and so on. With it being able to match you against Expert,Veteran or even higher it's just stupid. It really takes fun out of the game when you keep getting matched up against players that are much more skilled than you. My overall thoughts on the game are mixed, I still love the game, but It's really frustrating losing more than half of your matches because and keep getting matched up against players that are higher level than you, so they have more skill. I think you shouldn't buy the game if you get frustrated by losing undeservedly which everyone I think does. So just don't buy the game until developers do something about this '   Stupid    Matchmaking System' Have a nice day everyone!

7447	0	a	♥♥♥♥ THIS ♥♥♥♥ I GOT SCAMMED
7448	0	a	The game was fun at the beginning, where Psyonix actually cared more about making a fun game than making money. Now the game is a complete mess, you can't play every map in custom game (meaning you can't do certain game modes against your friends), some of the new maps seems to be only mades to be visually attractives and, worst of the worst, now the items drop is low, items are ranked by rarity, and you have to pay at least 1€ for 1 Key and a chance to drop another item that would have usually been in a DLC or a free update. In the meantime, servers are still unstables, matchmaking is full of bugs and strange choices are mades (like, WTF, you can hide your rank on an online game ?).  Anyway. Thanks, Psyonix, for turning from an independant dev who's happy to sell his game, to a company who try to make us pay more and more.

7452	0	a	Booted this up recently after a bit of a break, finding i'm having lag issues every couple of games making it basically unplayable despite my internet being fine. I've had no problems in the past and nothing has changed with my system so I have to attribute this to the game. Please fix it.
7453	0	a	The only saving grace of this game is the fact that it CAN be fun, especially the first 50 hours or so. After that it just sinks from there.   The worst part is probably that it seems like it has insane potential to be fun, but it just never seemed to achieve that potential once I realized how bad the physics are and by how much bs there can be.   Awful physics 80% of the time, ball speed doesn't seem to be reliant on car speed at all, and the luckiness of 75% of the goals made is unreal. Call me salty or bad or whatever other names you can think up, but everyone one that has sunk at least 100 hours into this game knows how what I'm talking about.   EDIT  The game is still 'fun' to play, especially as a new player. The game developers seem intent on ruining the competitive playlist with the inclusion of maps like Wasteland and Neo-Tokyo and the terrible competitive matchmaking system, even after the October 2016 rank update.  I'm not sure exactly how the competitive matchmaking system works, but it only seems to account for the actual ranks (challenger, rising star, etc.) and not for the in-game levels (like master, legend, etc.). Currently at All-star 1 as a level 53 Master and all I see are legends and rocketeers with the occasional master and even more rarely an expert.   I get limited enjoyment of the game, because usually after about 4 games I have had enough of bs goals or unfair match-ups.   11/10 - Would get tilted again
7454	0	a	Hey there.  Before I start: I definetly enjoy playing Rocket League - or, to be correct, I DID enjoy it.  The game brings everything you want for a competitive feeling, but does not let casual players behind. You have alot of fun modes, a good ranking system, the skill cap is perfect.  BUT, besides the fact, that the community seems to become more and more salty, the new maps screw up the whole experience. You can vote out 2 maps that you don't like - but they come just as often as if you hadn't voted them out (or disliked, like it says in the game). That makes it impossible for me to have fun in challanging matchups due to too much rng/map luck. Yes, all players have to handle it, but why do I have to play maps I do not only not enjoy but HATE them?  Psyonix says, that they won't implement the option to leave out maps that you don't like to make sure the waiting time for matches stays low. But I'd prefer waiting 10 minutes instead of playing this crap. Why don't let the players decide? Like seriously, there are enough people enjoying the new maps - so let them play it. But don't let others suffer for their good.  Will only go into playing private matches now to avoid this, but alot of players won't have this option.  Yours a disappointed player
7455	0	a	cannot play the game correctly whenever i launch season or online match the game stops and it say rocket league stopped working I have wasted my money on this game if you could help that will be appreciatable
7456	0	a	Wasteland (sloped floor map that messes with the games physics) in competitive matchmaking. Enough said.  Neo Tokyo. Derpy map that messes with the games core physics, and it's in competitive matchmaking. Enough said.
7457	0	a	I don't recommend this game because it is better to say 'I think it will be fun to play this game' rather than to say 'I thought it would be fun to play this game'. I'm playing the game with hopes that it gets better...  The community of this game is just toxic, for some people you can not miss even one ball, even if you don't play a ranked (competitive) match. You only want to make practice but the community doesn't let you to do so.  Sometimes the connection doesn't let you play and the game turns a nightmare and you just get frustrated.  The matchmaking is also a problem. After winning two or three matches your opponent is way better than the previous one, There is a huge difference between two matches if you keep winning several times.  A serious edit after a couple games: This game's community just shows us how bad a community can ever be! Getting worse every day!

But my only gripe with the game is that eventually it gets boring and there is not much for it.

7467	0	a	The game is very good, a simple idea but very, very addictive.  It is a low cost game and constantly updating free (rumble!!!) by the developer.  The learning curve is long but this is not a problem, i enjoyed every single time i made a step up in my skills.  I am sad i am writing a negative review because I admit i even dreamed once playing rocket league in the beggining.  There are 2 cons that force me not to recommend:  - it is written in store page that is full controller support game. Big lie.   Unless you have an xbox controller you cant be sure if the controller you already have is supported. So you have to buy one controller. This increases the cost of the game from to 20 euros to the cost of a triple A title.  Psyonix decided instead of supporting controllers for all players, to fund useless championships for limited elites.  -Aquadome. A new free venue for update. But is completely unoptimized. If your pc is above the minimum requirements, but not a monster, you cant play there. 11 fps is the maximum i could get.  So what's the problem? Just leave this venue dude...search for another round. Haha...someone idiot decided to put this unoptimized venue to ranked games. And getting unlucky to play twice in a row there it can ruin your whole effort in ranked games.   I dont know if i will launch again this game.  
7468	0	a	The game itself is fine, fun to play etc, but the community in this is worse than League of Legends, and the fact that if you loose the game going around playing almost demo only can result in you winning aswell. You will dislike it the more you play it, unless you have friends and can just mute the enemy ofc.
7469	0	a	you dont even play with people your level
7470	0	a	Rocket league starts out as a fun game but the more I continue to play it the worse the competetive game play gets. The ranking system is screwed to beyond hell where I win 6 out of 9 games and still am at the same rank I started at. The community is cancer and most people just ♥♥♥♥ talk in every competetive. The game has no room for error, every failure is a major setback to your rank and playing with a party is bascialy nessacary to get anywhere besides in ones (no one plays solo standard).
7471	0	a	Awsome, nice gameplay, great ingame content. Some negative points, last released map (Aquadome) gets a huge fps drop on old graphic boards and the matchmaking is not as fair as it should be. If you dont have a good internet connection you'll have troubles in the game cus you can only try to reconnect once and if you fail the reconnect button will disapear and you're unable to reconnect again.   In resume, if you dont have a good setup this game is not for you.

7475	0	a	You play a mini-car shooting a SLOOOOOOOOOOOW beach baloon.  But i'm the only one to see it ^^   It can be pretty fun sometimes, but it's SO SLOOW, i see it almost as a management game : you prepare your move a long long time before to shoot the ball. I'm more an arcade player, i have joy by reflexes and by pressing 100 buttons at the second, so it's not my taste. But here is the worst problem : lag, lags, lagggggss ! If you have a non-optimal internet connexion, you will be trolled by the camera 1 time of 2 : or the camera will return back, or it will slow the balloon just before to hit it, then you will pass just in front of it, like a ridiculous ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ unable to hit an enormous beach balloon. This is frustrating as hell.  There is not enough bad reviews, so i do one ^^  But sure it's a good game, for slobs, but fun when you understand the physic ^^

7478	0	a	This game is cool, but it gets me salty :(
7479	0	a	This is me boycotting the item trade-up system. You can't trade up very rares any further from commonly acquired items. At least give people who don't want to gamble a way to get items from crates.
7480	0	a	I don't recommend this game because it is better to say 'I think it will be fun to play this game' rather than to say 'I thought it would be fun to play this game'. I'm playing the game with hopes that it gets better...  The community of this game is just toxic, for some people you can not miss even one ball, even if you don't play a ranked (competitive) match. You only want to make practice but the community doesn't let you to do so.  Sometimes the connection doesn't let you play and the game turns a nightmare and you just get frustrated.  The matchmaking is also a problem. After winning two or three matches your opponent is way better than the previous one, There is a huge difference between two matches if you keep winning several times.  A serious edit after a couple games: This game's community just shows us how bad a community can ever be! Getting worse every day!
7481	0	a	Hey there.  Before I start: I definetly enjoy playing Rocket League - or, to be correct, I DID enjoy it.  The game brings everything you want for a competitive feeling, but does not let casual players behind. You have alot of fun modes, a good ranking system, the skill cap is perfect.  BUT, besides the fact, that the community seems to become more and more salty, the new maps screw up the whole experience. You can vote out 2 maps that you don't like - but they come just as often as if you hadn't voted them out (or disliked, like it says in the game). That makes it impossible for me to have fun in challanging matchups due to too much rng/map luck. Yes, all players have to handle it, but why do I have to play maps I do not only not enjoy but HATE them?  Psyonix says, that they won't implement the option to leave out maps that you don't like to make sure the waiting time for matches stays low. But I'd prefer waiting 10 minutes instead of playing this crap. Why don't let the players decide? Like seriously, there are enough people enjoying the new maps - so let them play it. But don't let others suffer for their good.  Will only go into playing private matches now to avoid this, but alot of players won't have this option.  Yours a disappointed player

7489	0	a	I was fun until it was not.
7490	0	a	Love the game. Many many many(!) hours of play time.  They just added microtransactions which really annoys me. I hate them in principle in any game I paid good money for. 'You don't have to buy them, it's only cosmetic!' I hear you say. Yes, except I will never then be able to get the cool new cars or skins those transactions unlock thus lockign off a portion of the content. Poor show!
7491	0	a	Great game, terrible company.  It's pretty messed up for a company to add and enforce a EULA months after purchase without an option to play the pre-EULA version. As for the EULA itself you're consenting to:  Personal information usage: 'the transfer of any personal information and other information to Psyonix, its affiliates, vendors, and business partners, and to certain other third parties'  Psyonix can revote access to the game for any reason: 'Except as otherwise prohibited by applicable law, Psyonix may limit, suspend, or terminate the license granted hereunder and access to the Software, including, but not limited to, any related services and products, at any time without notice for any reason whatsoever.' 
7492	0	a	It's a great game, but think hard before you buy if you want to play on Linux. I've had it for a while now, and multiplayer is pretty much broken. There seem to be some problems with the network code - I was in a multiplayer game with a ping of 32 just now but the whole screen was pulsing in and out, everything moving erratically. This has happened in every single game I've tried to play. It makes even seeing where the ball is impossible (to be honest, I couldn't even tell where I was half the time stuff was just moving so weirdly). I guess sync errors with the servers, but who knows.   It also crashes extremely frequently (every 1-2 games), but even though the crash reporter fires a half dozen times a day for me, they haven't patched the Linux client once as far as I can tell. It's hard to know if they're going to.  Local exhibition play is okay, but the bot AI is truly awful; a weird mix of perfect ball prediction and absolutely awful play. I've watched the bots sit on their own goal line as the ball rolls past them without making any effort to save. The number of times one bot on a team will just get lost at the far end of the pitch for no reason. Or you'll be in the middle of a dribble (of sorts) and a bot on your own side will fly over you and pass to the opposition... Or you'll be 2-1 up with 10 seconds left and your side will suddenly decide to score an own goal under no pressure. It's way too frustrating to recommend paying money to play against the AI.   Right now, you're paying full price for a game that is well below alpha quality on Linux.
7493	0	a	Somelike liked my previous review lol. Match making is terrible, community gets worse.GTA v has a WAY better community. I SERIOUSLY HOPE YOU FUKERS DIE, GET ILL SOON PLz. ....MATCH AFTER MATCH ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T
7494	0	a	Used to have no problems running this game despite my potato computer, now no matter what map I play my FPS will go from a smooth 60 to less than 10 making it compltetly unplayable. And this is every map, starting at beautiful 60 then dropping to less than 10 all at once. Unless you have an amazing computer that can run this game with no problem all the time then don't bother with this game it is a waste of money, which hurts me to say because of how much fun I have had playing this game before this problem started but now I can't get through a single match before dropping to less than 10 FPS, will update if the problem is fixed. 
7495	0	a	until they fix the rubberbanding issue what has lost me my rank countless times and stop making more crates and stupid skins for people to buy dont buy this game. It was amazing until this started happeneing now its gotten to the point that I dont even want to open this crude because I know ill just rage from the random rubberbanding at 40 ping THAT DOES NOT CHANGE. My intrenet is never the issue I just randomly start warping. Congratz Rocket League on absolutely screwing the pooch on this game now. I am sad to say that until I get a solid notice that they have fixd this problem I will not be playing this game anymore.
7496	0	a	im giving this a (hopefully temporary) thumbs down.   the latest patch really screwed the pooch. the latest patch was supposed to introduce an 'arena preferences' feature, so you could play less of the maps you dislike, and more of the ones you like. first, you can only thumbs down two maps, and many players have several they dislike. second, the likes and dislikes dont even seem to work, you still get put into maps you dont like very often, probably more than before. finally, they also added the 'labs' (experimental) maps to the standard queue. these maps are really different with many problems, and now players are forced to queue into them. (edit: Psyonix removed the labs maps for now, to fix a bug with them being selected too often, but said they will put them back when the bug is fixed)  so, instead of actually playing more of the maps you like and less of the ones you dont, its become the opposite, literally. total fail. if/when this is fixed, i will change the review.   edit: the following maps are not part of labs maps, but are still in ranked and standard, and you will get queued for them even if you dislike them, hate them, never want to play them:  Aquadome: I run this map fine, but many players report poor fps on this map, even if other maps get very good FPS. Psyonix said they improved it, but some still have problems. This map is way too 'busy' in appearance and is resource heavy. too many polygons and animations going on.   Starbase ARC: also way to 'busy' in appearance, with poor color choices. ball blends in with background, small boost pads are hard too see.   Tokyo: Probably the most hated map in the game. too narrow, doesnt flow well, has the most annoying ledges on the sides that make the map not fun. it doesnt matter if you dislike the map, the game will queue you for it anyways. if you leave the map in ranked, you will get a temp ban, if you leave in unranked, you lose MMR.    other than the issue of being forced to queue for maps you dont want to play on, this game is amazing, and easily GOTY of 2016, in my opinion.
7497	0	a	F*ck this game and the 'Rising Star/Shooting Star carry his silver friends' matchmaking system.  Play against guys who are 3 - 4 divisions above you and see how you get rekt while their silver friends go afk.  But thats not all, after the Carry-Ball-Homing-Missile ownd you with around 1200 Points, his silver friends with around 0 - 10 Points write things like 'EZ, hahahahahaha rekt'.  Best ranking experience of my life.  Edit: Today i got matched against a super champion (8 divisions above me) and a unrank guy who was better than the champion. BEST MATCHMAKING EVER.

7505	0	a	Got the game as a friend told me it was epic. He was not wrong. This is one of the best games i've ever played.  However unless you have a buddy or two to play with none stop it is simply not enjoyable because all random players want to do is hit the ball. They smash you out of the way, they smash the ball towards their own goal, they will jump over you and hit the ball to the side of the pitch even though you had a clear shot on goal. I cannot recommend the game soley based on my unpleasurable experience with other players.  If that kind of thing doesnt bother you then sure buy the game, you'll be hooked too!
7506	0	a	Loved the game, but rocket labs make the game ♥♥♥♥. Plz change this and I will continue to play this game. I hate having to leave over and over just becuase of getting put in a game on a rocket lab map.
7507	0	a	Great game, but absolutely toxic community.
7508	0	a	This game is f***ing broken. In it's current state this game is unplayable competetively, let me explain why.  1. Matchmaking either finds you oponnents who are way, WAY worse than you or way, way, WAY WAY better than you, no match (2v2 with my friend) feels like it is even and both teams are trying to win, it's just a stomp either way, as in 9:2 or 0:4  2. Netcode for this game is utterly broken - i know some mismatches here and there in a fast paced game are to be expected, but when i get scored on after blocking the ball on my screen it's not fun. Even better so that the replays show me actually blocking the ball, the ball SPAZES OUT FOR A SECOND, then continues on its original trajectory, as if i was not even there.  3. Last but not least is the luck factor. It wouldn't be such an issue by itself but the problems above make it just all out rng. I'd say your skill contribution during a match is like 40%. The rest is just a question of 'Is the enemy 4 times as good as me?' and 'I was winning 4:0 but then the netcode started to die and it wouldnt register me hitting the ball randomly and i ended up losing 4:5' - I'm running into those situations all the time.   I play about 10-20 matches a day, 1v1 ranked and 2v2 with my friend. Im challenger 2 in both. We keep running into people who either dont know they can jump twice or people who can bounce the ball 9 times in the air while scoring on you. This ruins all the fun of the game. All of it.  The only reason im still playing this broken heap of s**t is some faint stupid hope that they will fix those issues and pure sado-masochism on my part.

7511	0	a	The game starts out as being fun but if you start doing ranked and care a little bit you will soon realize how ♥♥♥♥ing awful their matchmaking and point distribution system is. It's such a chore to grind as losses are more punishing than victories. Devs do nothing to make the game better, all they care about is doing imports from the old game for money. Game has stagnated since its release
7512	0	a	It was fun until I hit level 20. Now I'm stuck in a purgatory where everyone is better than I am and I can only win 1 out of every 5 games. I know I'm not that good at this game, so why can't I play with other players of similar skill? The game is completely ruined for me.
7513	0	a	I know that this review will get a lot of dislikes,because of Rocket League fan boys,but I dont mind. The game looks pretty fun.Football and cars,what can you want more? First I was really happy,and game was looking awesome for first 20 hours.After that I saw 'Glorious Matchmaking'. Ranking system is so broken.After 4 wins cant even get division up?Lost 1,division down.Great logic. Second thing about matchmaking is,if you play for example 2x2,1 guy is Prospect 2 rank,other one is Challanger 3,they will get opponent around Prospect 3-4 rank.So thats not even fair from opponent side.CS GO had same terrible ranking system,but after some years they managed to fix it.Rocket league MUST fix it,because its really frustrating from personal experience.Or if you want to get all achievements you must buy DLC,thats another bad thing from customer point of view. And third thing,community is really terrible.Just like in Dota 2 or CS.Sometimes I regret,that i bought this game. Game isnt bad,but it needs some fixes.If you have friends to play,go get it.But until developers wont fix Matchmaking system,I couldnt recommend this game for others. Thanks for reading! :)
7514	0	a	This is a brilliant game, when it works. Recently the lag has been unbearable even with a ping of around 20ms and I can\'t recommend the game until the lag issues have been sorted.
7515	0	a	Amazingly fun game. Skill ceiling is somewhere up in the clouds. Highly addicitve gameplay keeps me around day after day, but this game suffers from a horribly toxic community. If you are just a casual player that sticks to unranked matched or you play mostly with friends, I don't think there are many games I could recommend more highly than this. But, if you find yourself getting better and better and you switch over to ranked play, prepare to encounter salty, aggressive, and downright mean players on a regular basis, especially as you progress higher and higher up the ladder.  Maybe it's the nature of competitive gameplay, but as a person who has played a considerable number of hours in other competitive games in the past, this one is up high on the list of toxic communities. The playerbase of Rocket League, far more than the gameplay itself, frequently leaves me feeling upset and irritated after just a few matches. Every minor mistake is immediately met with punishing insults and taunting by your own teammates. Even though I will continue to play this game, it is because of the community that I encounter day after day that I have to say I ultimately do not recommend this game.  TLDR:  Great fun for casual play or matches with friends. But if you are looking for a competitive game to enjoy, this one has a horribly toxic community that will leave you feeling frustrated and angry more than anything else.
7516	0	a	Good game if you can play with a team, like a bunch of friends. If you can only play solo then this game is absolute torture. Matchmaking is random so you'll end up with random people and most of the time it's just frustrating to play with random people. It's often just a 50/50 chance of winning unless you're so good that you can carry your team, but that'll require hundreds of hours of gameplay. So if you are a casual gamer and not so passionate about the game then you'll just end up in a rank and never get out of there. So to most people I would not recommend this game.  -The ranking system is also horrible. It's not transparent and it seems to be only based on wins and your points. So if you lose, but you play a decent game then you're still going down ranks. There is no personal skill level or current form.  -The Wasteland Arena is a terrible arena, because it has these weird slopes on the side. It comepletely changes the game and can get you out of the game easily.  -The community is quite toxic or simply annoying. People will insult you and talk ♥♥♥♥ of you. You also have people who do not pay attention, who are afk or who are deliberately ruining the game for you. You'll end up losing because of them and down a rank you go. Ofcourse that is unfair and you can report them, but you'll never know if reporting people even has any effect. So why should you even bother reporting?  -The kickoff system isn't great either. It just lies there at the center spot and you all just rush towards it. Most of the time it's just a big cluster♥♥♥♥ and the ball ends up somewhere you would not expect it to end up. Due to this you'll get a lot direct or indirect kick-off goals. You can be leading with 2-0 and then within a few seconds you can be behind 2-3.  With a few tweaks this game could be so much better. Especially for people who play more solo than with friends or in a team. However, in it's current state the game is just more frustrating than fun and therefore I can not recommend this game.
7517	0	a	It's fun, it's a spectacular game to play. Unfortunately, there's a flaw that I would like to address. Somehow, the game shows that I only have 40 ping, but it plays as if I have 600 or some vile number up there. I'm not sure what causes this issue, but it's definitely not on my part. My gaming rig is up to date and my internet is solid. Sometimes, though, there are those incidents where the game gets really choppy and everything goes to hell.   Sorry if this review felt more like a rant, but I feel that this is a necessary topic to bring up to the community. If anyone else experiences this, please contact me and let me know if you fixed it. Is your gameplay back up to speed, no pun intended.  Well, that concludes my review. I am not saying that this game is an utter sack of crap when I put a negative review. I am just saying I am not content with the way the game runs sometimes. I will try my best to look into a solution, I am not going to sit and wait because I love this game and want to play more! I just can not tolerate losing due to complications that I can not control. I would like to play Rocket League smoothly. I will return to the game, surely. I will also return with happiness and joy and not anger and the urge to toss my laptop out the window.
7518	0	a	Why not recommend a game when you enjoy it? Because I hate it more than I enjoy it when I play 1vs1, which tells me that the game could be alot better and isn't for people that dont have friends, or friends that are online alot. If you have dedicated friends to this game, its worth it. Otherwise? More frustration than anything else on 1v1 or queuing solo standard with randoms which mainly destroy the game. Why is 1vs1 so bad than? Kind of boring repeating strategies with people literally camping every corner until you make the slightest mistake and counter you onto that, after that you cant get to the ball when it slowly rolls inside of your goal without any skill needed, I like to play a game for fun not for tryharding at 1v1.
7519	0	a	This is by far not an entirely negative review, but a statement of current player base. It is ever increasingly full of poison and salt derivated from LoL. Make a single mistake, or even play well and do good passes, and you will be cried upon by someone who has done far less for the team simply because of reason I cannot explain. There is plenty of fun to be had in unranked and with friends, but play alone in solo ranked or with 'strangers' as in non-RL steam friends, and you eventually will be so salty that not even the lobsters will want a taste of your remaining corpse.  I was an all-star and saw a quick purple sign before passing down again. I've gradually spiraled down to gold because of a chain of random salty people refusing to play well as they are more concerned with crying at your play, regardless of being good or bad, simply because it somehow contradicts their expectations from you. Perhaps they are offensive players and wish for you to camp in the goal all round, perhaps they are supportive players trying to make passes and due to a sad childhood immediately rages on if not a 100% of their passes are perfectly picked up on every single time, or maybe they're just tired after a 10 hour long shift at work with annoying customers and a baby that simply just won't stay quiet. Regardless of the circumstances, play enough and you'll find yourself in a worse mood after logging off than before logging in.  This league is nothing but a rocket full of salt eager to take off into oblivion.  Though if you are able to not be upset by the unecessary and often unwarranted salty behavior, Rocket League is an absolutely magnificent game with countless of hours of fun.
7520	0	a	Could be a great game if it wasn't for the bad matchmaking. Rookies get put in games with Veterans, players in queue get put in losing side matches that are 0-6 with no chance of a win.  Not to mention the players using cheats to farm for rare crates. If you are a casual gamer who doesn't intend on playing ranked then stay away from this game until the players who are botting are banned faster or you will end up having regular games where all your team are bots.
7521	0	a	It used to be a good game.  But Psyonix don't care anymore.  Micro-transactions : Check Toxicity without any working report system : Check Unfair ranked matches : Check Unbalanced Maps : Check  I really loved this game, but i feel like the more Psyonix earn money, the more they start to become like EA or gold digger game companies.  As fun as this game is, i can't recommend it.
7522	0	a	Some people do not like rocket labs... Some people don't queue for them and now they're forced to play them.... Why? Give us the option of playing them but don't force players to play them. When you get put into one of the labs maps most people quit leaving those who want to play them alone with bots... They ruined a good game
7523	0	a	  Too many trollers and they wont get banned since they are allowed to score own goals or go AFK.
7524	0	a	A week ago I would have recommended this game, but it's been thoroughly ruined in just one update. Standard now has 6 novelty maps and you can't soft-opt out of more than 2. And now there's really too many of these maps to sustain just leaving them when you get put in them without losing your mind.  If you are playing Rocket League casually and don't really care about competition, maybe still give it a shot. But for competitive players, there's no real concept of standardization anymore so give it a pass.

7533	0	a	I really enjoy the gameplay but the matchmaking system in both compet and unranked is questionable at times, especially when a team get so badly dominated due to the odd team mate that really shouldn't be in this queue.  I also find it fustrating that i have not one, not two, but three 'super rare' trails, that i can't trade in. Why have i been given 3 Super rare Frostbite trails? two were in a row! This makes no sense at all and again, means i'm limited in what i can get because now, i have to wait for more 'drops', i need in total, 25 'uncommon' just to get another chance at getting a stupid trail that i only need one of.  I will recommend this game when they update the matchmaking system and also update the 'trade in' system.
7534	0	a	Online is nearly broken due to the insane amount of crate bots. Every other match I get into it's crate bots on either my team or the enemy team. This issue needs fixed fast. If you're looking to play online I'd tell you to wait until they fix this bot issue.
7535	0	a	This game is getting a thumbs down until they fix the broken map system. It's literally impossible to play the old school maps where you can see the ball anymore. You get nothing but the new maps (which are cool the first time don't get me wrong) but then you get them every other game and it's just too much going on and you cannot see the ball or anything going on. It's literally ruined the game for me and the 'Thumbs Down' system literally has zero effect. A group of 2 people who thumbs down the same map should have a 100% not to get that map yet my buddy and I get the three maps 50% of the time. GG Psyonix it was fun but you're ruining the game
7536	0	a	The linux version crashes all the time and bans you from servers. Completely frustrating.
7537	0	a	Cars + Soccer = I don't know what I am doing.
7538	0	a	I loved this game, I constantly told everyone it was amazing and the devs were some of the best...  then they had to add the garbage that is crates/trading, so no thanks, never playing again.
7539	0	a	Don't like how it's becoming a money grab for cosmetics. I don't like the gambling ways of these type of games. I won't be playing more, because honestly, this game will take all my money like CSGO did.   Waste.
7540	0	a	Used to be a astonishing game until the maps came out which caused a total breakdown of FPS and ping.. If Psyonix would left the maps alone this game would have been a great success, but nooo Psyonix had to make the glitchiest and worst FPS maps ever.. Way to go Psyonix +1 dislike!
7541	0	a	This game is cancer.
7542	0	a	This game would be great if the alternate maps weren't in the ranked play because every damn time i play i get the starbase or tokyo maps and they are the worst maps in the entire game. If the devs ever read my review then they should know that you keep those terrible maps in rumble for gods sakes.
7543	0	a	this game is so bad, i could get 60 autistic kids and make a better game/server, better yet 60 blind autistic kids and make this game great again! Trump needs to fix the servers before i take my life. On the verge of killing of myself, also un installed, 44 ping but game keeps skipping, not my graphics card or anything
7544	0	a	If your not into online games, don't get this. Offline needs alot more attention.

7546	0	a	Game is pretty good, but matchmaking matches me, a semipro, with 3 veterans. Please fix...
7547	0	a	We just want to play! And you close the servers on us?! Not cool men,not cool
7548	0	a	The game in itself is great, it looks good and the gameplay in itself is absolutely fenomenal...  And after all of this the whole game is just a big dissapointment. First of all the matchmaking will make you want to drink bleach since it dishes out mismatches every second game or finds out countless of other ways to f**k up the match before it even starts. Secondly I can say that I have played games from CoD's to League of Legends but Rocket League has the most toxic community there is for sure. There's not a single game where someone isn't screaming insults to the mic, writing trash comments in the chat or spamming the quickchat (Which by the way is the dumbest addition to ANY game, quickchat's have allways been and will allways be trash that only results in spamming and whatnot)  Then there's the whole 'physics' part which is driving me nuts... Sometimes just a light tap to another car sends them flying to another reality whereas sometimes even if you ram into someone with supersonic speeds it's like you've hit god himself, when the other car simply stops you on your tracks.. And lastly atleast in my opinion, every addition they've made after the *Battle Cars dlc has been making the game somehow worse. It's like the creators are pushing content out forcibly on gunpoint, since they seem to lack the fun and simplicity that made this game so special to me once..    So when you combine this matchmaking system with the toxic community and half-a**ed physics you're just bound to not have a good time.  As an idea, visually and atleast somewhat mechanically this game is surely a 9-10/10, but when you're actually playing and trying to enjoy the game it's is barely a 2/10. Honestly as sad as it is to say, I wouldn't buy this game again or recommend it to anyone.
7549	0	a	Do you like bad matchmaking? Do you like getting two random people on your team vs a full premade group of people ranked higher than you?   Have you ever thought, man I really would just love to lose a rank every single time I lose a game, but I wanna win at least 5 to go up a rank? Have you ever wanted a system where people can destroy you over and over and over and bully you but the report function just doesn't do anything?   I think you're getting warmer to the game for you! Welcome to Rocket League, where the matchmaking is literally moronic. Did you just lose rank in a ranked match against a full premade 3? Did you queue again? GOOD NEWS! Now it queues you back with that premade 3 team YOU LOST AGAINST! So now you can lose again with two random people again! But your rank? DON'T WORRY ABOUT YOUR RANK! You'll be fine in the starting division III.   Lose a game and go down a division? Don't worry, you only need to win 3 to go up and 1 to go down, this game is challenging!  If you consider this purchase don't forget to run down to your local store and pickup extra strength bleach to wash it down with!

7551	0	a	This game can be fun but the matchup system is complete GARBAGE. I am only a semi-pro and the lowest I'll match is a pro and I have won maybe 4/20 games. This game obviously is for someone who is born REALLY good at the game or who practices a lot on a different account. Other than that, great game and great soundtrack.

7560	0	a	the newest update in rocket league stole 35 of my crates and stoll 27 keys of mine which does cost money and took all of my certifications 
7561	0	a	I loved this game for its hoops mode. My favorite car is and always will be the Merc. Lately though something feels different. It seems to behave heavier, and I can't get as much air as I used to. So now there is an unbalance between the cars you choose, and everyone in hoops seems to be using the same car. Even in Standard the larger cars are seeming worse than smaller ones, less reliable, hard to get any air. Can't recommend this game until they remove whatever changes they made to the cars to unbalance them.
7562	0	a	This game was made by a bunch of psychopaths who hate people and want to watch the world burn. There is so much unfair ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t in the physics everyone you play against seem to be hacking. When you are getting thrashed it is no fun but if you leave the match you are banned from finding any game - casual or ranked - for 10 mins. Playing this game has made me have serious homicidal thoughts towards Psyonix and pretty much every ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who plays the game.
7563	0	a	Dont buy this game right now the lagg is so bad you cant play this online, or with freinds if your ok with never playing online then get it, its fun but otherwise i wouldnt get it till the issue is fixed.
7564	0	a	This game has lots of potential. But this game has many problems. Community of this game is cancer. Every match ends with someone getting mad and blaming someone else about them losing the match. half of the players in this game run after the ball and try to do some kind of aerial hits and most of the time completely missing the ball.  So most of the games are that there's about everyone flying around and trying to be the first one to hit the ball, then someone luckily hits and scores. After that someone gets mad and stops playing or starts scoring own goals and writes terrible stuff about his teammates.  Camera in this game is terrible and controls don't work at all.   if you want to keep your sanity, don't play this crap..

7569	0	a	Rocket League has one of the best progression systems I've ever seen in a video game before...  Rookie - You can't hit ♥♥♥♥. You are a disgrace to your team and the game.  Semi Pro - You can now sometimes hit the ball. Don't even try to hit it in the right direction or think about your positioning. You're only Semi Pro so you can just go ahead and hit that ball! You also made a bicycle hit that one time but yeah nah you're still ♥♥♥♥.

7573	0	a	Making this review hurts my heart because I generally love the game but I have been experiencing the teleportation bug and I can't play because of that and if these glitches debugged then I would certainly recommend this game as it is so easy to play.
7574	0	a	Was fun, now its rarely played and has ''DLC''
7575	0	a	The game is good. But the matchmaking can be worse than UPlay. Rookies playing against people who have hundreds of hours in this game completely kills it. Good graphics, good physics, nice cars but terrible matchmaking.
7576	0	a	Great Game, however I cannot recommend it due to them adding in microtransactions in the form of crates. This would be ok if you could get the key to these crates as a drop in game, however your are forced to purchase them. Not ok in a game that is not F2P.
7577	0	a	This game is f*ing trash
7578	0	a	Game is fun at first, then you realize you get points for winning and losing. After several weeks of playing your go up against 'GODS' Haven't won a match in 2 weeks. If you try to email  rlsupport@psyonix.com  of the match making issue, one simply gets an email back saying rlsupport does not exist. :(
7579	0	a	Gets Boring very quickly so don't get it
7580	0	a	If you enjoy getting told off everytime you lose and getting told it was 'ez' this is a game for you. The toxic community has really been giving it their all lately and i don't think it's going to stop any time soon. Great game if you look at the game itself but overall theres way too much salt and 12 year olds shouting ez after every goal and telling you how bad you are.  So keeping that in mind dont buy the game if your looking for a good community. The polite people are in there but it's a 1/100 chance you will find people like that. Mostly the people you win against are the nice people.
7581	0	a	I only recommend this game if you have a good PC. The new maps basically ruined my experience. Now I get less than 20 fps on the new maps , while on the old ones I still get over 60 fps. If they add a option where you select what maps you want to play on , I will definitly play it again.
7582	0	a	Competitive is an ABSOLUTE JOKE. 50% of the time my team mate has left or is AFK, 25% of the time there is absolutely no similarity in skill (sometimes chal 2 div 2 gets matched up with chal 3 div 3... SIX DIVISIONS AHEAD AND ONE LEVEL). Tokyo is a ♥♥♥♥ map and should be in comp and neither should the astro map... yet they took out the more normal fish map...  There is literally no point in comp if you're going to be versing people six divisions above you... you can't win. And when you are the one above everyone else, your team mate is low level too.  DO NOT BUY FOR COMP, IT IS TRASH. They should have called it 'normal v2' cause they do a TERRIBLE job at making comp competitive.

7585	0	a	♥♥♥♥♥est game ever, they cant even hold a good connection. They have updates left and right but dont do anything to fix this ♥♥♥♥ game.
7586	0	a	one of the best games ever. then they updated it and ruined everything.
7587	0	a	The game is good except for its aweful server picker, in eu, some servers are fantastic, but some just let everyone there play with ~200-300 ping which is aweful and ruins the game, thus this game becomes unplayable. And you cant pick which EU server, and they just assign you to anyway so you get a 50/50 chance to get a horrible one or a good one.
7588	0	a	Game lags is a REAL problem. the servers are not good enough to play the game in Turkey. I could not see my ping go beyond 70-80 when my opponents have 15-20.   The calculation of the movement and the phsics of the game lacking sometimes. As long as this is a really fast game, the physics could not keep up and wrong calculations make the game based on luck, more. You never make your &lt;best shot&gt; on purpose. It just happens. But I swear the god worst shots are far more frequent.  3 years old could not be banned, like most of online games, but in this game, they have a real f.king majority. 3 out of 5 games you just tear your hair off! Swearing little kids are playing like a king while they are playing against you but they play like a monkey while they are on your side. Cursing on the mic and chat are not a cause of ban. Actually I never heard someone really banned from Rocket League.   Long story short; this is kid's game. If you are kinda middle-ish aged and expecting something more than some little boys swearing around, go somewhere else. This is their neighborhood.
7589	0	a	Steam removed me it from my library.. I bought it for 20€ omg.. 
7590	0	a	you need a really fast computer for it to work the best. otherwise it is really laggy and not much fun. I do not recommened if you do not have a gaming laptop or desktop.
7591	0	a	Rocket League is a game in which you play football/soccer, but instead of humans you control cars with boosters and a double jump. Many people will agree when I say that, that is an ingenious idea and it is well enough executed to be a videogame. And apart from the drifting which is in most racing games the most fun thing to do, I fail to see the point of implementing it so poorly in this game.  And now the bad stuff. There may be different options for a ball and what not and many different stadiums which are all the same, but it doesn't help that you never change how/what you play. Imagine buying every single FIFA game and you have to play each one 2 hours at least. That's Rocket League in a nutshell. They never bother to build in courses, powerups or cars with unique stats, cause that means work. And nobody likes work.   So it ends up feeling like an overprized early access indie game, where each day to pray to god that they actualy make this game fun. But nope  It's supose to be like an e-sports game or something In e-sports, there is no fun allowed.
7592	0	a	I honestly hate this game, worst 3 euro of my life
7593	0	a	what a server! what an update! hey guys job done! u f...ed the game compilitly  Tnx!!!!! aaaaaaaaaaa one more thing is that the bot of this game can not even thouch the shadow of the ball but it it can score the owngoal. good for the developer of this pice of s..t.
7594	0	a	This game is not fun at all. It's all about luck, no matter if you are skilled or not. After all, cars and football can't give something good... I'm still unsure of the nature of all the hype for this game. It will continue to baffle me how it gets raving reviews.
7595	0	a	Disgusting game to play with randoms. Unbelievable amount of leavers each match. Probably 8 out of 10 matches end up with someone leaving and being replaced by dumb AI. The servers are also in questionable quality. I had some servers timeout from time to time. With mates - Definately With randoms - lol. Nope.
7596	0	a	Good game, but...  Ranking system is f*cking sh*t, won 8 games in a row, divion up once. Then lost one and division down, won 3 and nothing. Then loose 1 more and f*cking division down. Like WTF?! Sort that ♥♥♥♥ out.
7597	0	a	I can't say anything else but: FIX YOUR DAMN PHYSICS! Seriously the ball moves in completely unrealistic angles when hit by two cars and accelerates when 2 opposing forces hit it. Also hitregistration is buggy as well as random. Servers are super instable as soon as someone with a ping of 60+ is on the server. (Ping 60 is marked by the game as 3/3 connectivity bars) Glitches appear frequently with higher pings as well as jumping through the ball or an enemy player.  This results in frequent ragequits due to random wins and losses. You could toss a coin at the beginning of a match wouldn't make a difference.  Also the league system in ranked is the best BS I have ever seen. You win 10 matches in a row without a league-up. (just asking for a league increas not even a rank increase. (5 leagues in each rank) ) But after that 10 won matches you loose 1 !!! time and instantly loose a league. DAFUQ is this randomness.  Also the ingame pointsystem is super buggy. Sometimes you save and get a clear ball rewarded instead or you save and get nothing, cause the game doesn't register the ball would've actually be a goal.   All of that gets WORSE with every gameupdate.
7598	0	a	The idea of the game is good and would be great for you and say 5 other friends but online you can be set up with alot of people who cant be decent teammates. only once in about a 100 will you get a decent team that will know how to do something and not ones that will knock their own teammates into orbit.  Main issue is that if you play by yourself you get set up with people that play this game day in and day out. so when people like us that only do it causal. we get the teams that suck so hard vs. the team thats trying to play like pros, all that have chat and coordination. so whats the point of playing this.
7599	0	a	After update which add 'tricks' (I don't have any idea how it call it.) is game terrible chaotic. In original game players need some skills, but now is all about luck, luck and luck. Skills is for losers. Some player have better trick, than you so he have little bit more luck. Verdict after this update is game about luck.
7600	0	a	While I love this game I cannot recommend it to anyone to spend their hard-earned money on. It has been slowly going down the wrong path with the addition of crates, the Rumble game type, and AquaDome. The addition of the AquaDome arena is the main driver for this negative review. My laptop (see specs below) is under spec and I get that but have been able to happily play many hours with low quality graphics and get a very playable 30 fps. Then they added AquaDome. I get a very choppy, laggy 10 fps and have to account for a 1 or 2 second delay. Now this was never a problem until this arena and it is negatively influencing my ranking. Every time I play in that arena in a ranked match my team loses because I cannot contribute. Once again, I understand that I am below spec but with the direction this game is going, it will make it unplayable on a wide range of computers and that's a shame to see. I try my hardest to avoid that one arena but that's impossible in ranked matches. Before you consider buying this game ensure that you have at least the minimum specs listed, otherwise your gameplay experience will be less than satisfactory with new features.

7601	0	a	I can't reccomend the game in it's current state, specially regarding Competitive.  Current problems:  Competitive is infested with tryhards and High ranked-low tier leechers: You can be a Challenger in 2vs2 competitive and your opponents can still be a Prospect 1 paired with a Rising Star. This happens often, in fact it has happened on almost each match i've played of each category of Competitive. This makes the Competitive experience crap, since there's no such thing as fair pairing.  Until this crap is patched, i CAN'T reccomend anyone to buy the game, specially if you are interested in Competitive ladder.   Bets Wishes

7604	0	a	Terrible update with bad maps and a broken ranked system that unfairly pairs players. If you want to play a competitive game, don't buy this.
7605	0	a	New season update is really bad!  1. I as an 'Expert' rank get matched with a lot of 'Semi-pro's' and 'Pro's' every single time now.  2. They added a map that makes no sense (even added to the competitive matchmaking).  3. Forfeiting a competitive match now bans you for 15 minutes. Now I'm totally fine with this for competitive mode but this INCLUDES casual matchmaking. It's stopping u from playing CASUAL. Like srsly???  I'm not recommending this game at its current state. I will change this to recommended if they fix this issue.

7607	0	a	Game is Good.  Community is 80% cancer.   Proboally not thier fault but laggy servers.  Fun with friends.  I don't like cars.  Big Balls.  Microtransactions  I'm reccomending this game but voting no.
7608	0	a	First off this is an amazing game to play with friends.  The reason I can't recommend it though is because the community is VERY toxic (think CS:GO but worse).  Psyonix is just getting around to banning afk players who queue up for ranked (over a year after launch) but only after they implemented crates for cosmetic skins. They still though won't ban the players who type the awful racist comments in text chat.  If you have friends buy it for endless hours of fun but if you queue solo, like many players, prepare yourself to get everything under the sun yelled at you while you play.

7614	0	a	Great game, however they've added in spasticated arenas with different walls and is the worst thing to play with. Ruined the game since these were added in and it's no fun getting ♥♥♥♥ed over cuz the new maps are ♥♥♥♥
7615	0	a	This game great, but then they had a competition: Let's make the most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ map ever. The winner was this f****** Neo Tokyo map. Shoot the ball against any wall and it will land in front of ur own goal 99,99% of the time.  BAAAHINDERT   WHY U DO THIISSSSSSSSSSSSS   MANY STUPIDO NOT WOW, SUCH DISAPONTMENT
7616	0	a	I'm going to make to this quick, because really iv'e spent to much time on this piece of trash already.  I consider myself a professional level gamer and to be frank. Rocket League is a ♥♥♥♥ing joke.  The online is unstable. The player base is awful, not only are they toxic but they also fail so hard at the game they play. I know Psynoix tried their hardest to appeal to gamers like myself but I honestly feel like they should just give up.   Sure the game is fun to mess around with but for anyone interested in learning to get better or challenge themselves, look else where.   Short version:   Unless you like babying around as the only worth while trait of a game. Avoid Rocket League...Its shallow.
7617	0	a	Maybe one of the worst game i've ever seen it's jsut some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t random lucky game if you win some games, you can just play lotto. All you have to do is boost random on the ball and score... If you loose that mean you are a normal guy that has nearly 0 luck, ♥♥♥♥ this game

Now in season 3 the ranking system is ♥♥♥♥ and you don't gain a division for each win, but you definitely go down one if you lose. The matchmaking is absolute ♥♥♥♥ and climbing is impossible. In the old ranking system it was at least 50-50, you win one you go up, you lose one you go down. But now it's unfair and even if you're already a pro losing unlucky games drags you down the ladder and reaching the top could take up to hundreds, maybe thousands of games.   Please return to season one ranking system instead of leeching the ideas of others (CSGO), you literally copied their ranking system with 'new' creative names for each step.
7620	0	a	If you play solo modes it's impossible to win!   This game is about empty goals!!!   I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME IF YOU DON'T HAVE FRIEND!!!
7621	0	a	It would be a great game if I could play it without lag, it ruins online game, and that is all this game is really for....
7622	0	a	my game i load it up and it says rocket league has stopped working then crashes and only does it on this game i dont know why i need help please
7623	0	a	Now, I say that I don't recommend this game, but that is only because I have mostly played solo. I feel like without Skyping a friend or in teamspeak with a group, the game is dead as f**k. But with friends, it is one of the most interesting game I've played in 2016.

7628	0	a	I'm going to make to this quick, because really iv'e spent to much time on this piece of trash already.  I consider myself a professional level gamer and to be frank. Rocket League is a ♥♥♥♥ing joke.  The online is unstable. The player base is awful, not only are they toxic but they also fail so hard at the game they play. I know Psynoix tried their hardest to appeal to gamers like myself but I honestly feel like they should just give up.   Sure the game is fun to mess around with but for anyone interested in learning to get better or challenge themselves, look else where.   Short version:   Unless you like babying around as the only worth while trait of a game. Avoid Rocket League...Its shallow.

7636	0	a	Soon after finding out that the main music to the game is nig nog rap crap, I refunded it. Pfft, pathetic.     TLDR CAUSE I'M SLOW: Heuy's too black sounding for me
7637	0	a	This game got old after the first two dozen goals and half a dozen saves. Couple that with an ever expanding library of local multiplayer games on steam (as well as the few good games they currently offer), and it quickly becomes a title that collects dust in the 'z' category of my steam library.  That said, it's not a bad game in and of itself. It delivers what it promises, isn't buggy or laggy, and the controls feel natural.
7638	0	a	  this game has given me many hours of fun...and many hours of rage. i am constantly teamed with PSYNET players that are duo queued together and dont know how to play the game. i also have lost much respect for the Rocket League team for creating these pay-to-win cars that have better hit boxes than any of the free cars and funnily enough, almost every PSYNET player has one of the pay-to-win cars. i am also ♥♥♥♥♥♥ that Rocket League has stooped to such a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ low of selling cases and keys...what the actual ♥♥♥♥, nothing upsets me more than when a game i play wants to suck all of the money out of their long time fan's wallets. i recieved this game as a gift and played it with my friends a lot and had some fun but honestly, dont buy it unless you are going to be ♥♥♥♥faced drunk with a couple of friends.
7639	0	a	It is a good game but it does need a lot of practice and patience. And most importantly playing it with keyboard is not enjoyable and fun (at least for ME!). But I can see why people would like this game.
7640	0	a	Rocket league was a brilliant game until the recent update where the ♥♥♥♥ing stupid ♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ing developers choose to support ♥♥♥♥ing noobs who generally play like ♥♥♥♥. Basically they changes the games gravity and some other features to make the gamre much easier, in turn riuning the game for people who have played it from the start. I myself am the highest achiveable rank and completed both of the seasons in high positions, but seriously this game is now a steaming pile of ♥♥♥♥ and helped by the recent sale thousands of ♥♥♥♥tards have entered making it a living hell. So its a big ♥♥♥♥ u to the devs and an even bigger ♥♥♥♥ u to the noobs who caused this.   Good game but the bounce system, rediculosly shot pairing system and pathetic physics need to be improved. And kill me the next time the servers drop.... oh im dead
7641	0	a	Enjoyed it for 10hrs until the last update broke my game, can't even play online anymore because of the stupid lag.
7642	0	a	Getting worse and worse by the day. Servers going down, seriously jacked up matchmaking system and a ranking system that makes no sense. Not to mention the constant flaming from little kiddos. Used to be a pretty great community where people would call out trolls and didn't take ♥♥♥♥ from other players. Now its just filled with little 420 kiddies who just talk ♥♥♥♥. Yeah, 10/10. Great experience.
7643	0	a	This game makes me cancer
7644	0	a	i just want to give them a negative review because they have something great but they keep shoving garbage down our throats.. enough with the custom maps in ranked and now forcing terrible rocket lab maps into normal game. gotta dodge 4 normal games in a row to get a normal map to have fun on? kinda lame
7645	0	a	to be honest the game is fun but if you try to play ranked alone you are completely and utterly ♥♥♥♥ed.(in the low ranks) every other game there is a disconect or somebody I swear that doesnt have a monitor because they cant hit anything. This added ontop of the fact that unless you are in 1v1s you need decent teamates otherwise you will get ♥♥♥♥ on. This review is mostly driven by salt but I honestly cant recomend this game.
7646	0	a	After playing this game for over 400 hours I came to the conclusion that I can not recommend this game. The game itself is pretty awesome, but many of the players you'll meet in public games just aren't. The game changed quite a bit over time due to patching and the addition of new stuff, but not all for the better. Once you reach the level of expert/master, things change. Matchmaking becomes quite a joke and not everyone is interested in playing all available maps. With the latest patch you're somewhat forced to play maps you don't want to play in unranked matches. How to counter this? Exactly: play ranked. Ranked matches are flawed these days.   If you do not have a proper team to play with and communicate with, chances of losing are high. Lots and lots of trolls in this game, idlers, smurfs, people leaving ranked matches, and so on. Not to mention the salty people you'll encounter. On the higher levels it comes down to skills and teamplay. Skills you can practice for, but for teamplay you need proper teammates, not usually the ones you'll find in public games who all chase the ball into the same corner all the time. With non-ranked games you'll encounter a lot of players leaving and joining all the time. People give up way too easily and some stay in a game for way too long. Surely everyone is allowed to do what they want, but don't ruin the match for others.  For me this game is only fun when playing with a proper team. Public games are more of a struggle rather than anything else these days. For new players the game will be fun nonetheless, learning all the techniques, being amazed at how you actually managed to score a really weird goal from a weird angle, bumping into other players all the time and failing bigtime at flying. I'm not an expert at this game myself and I make mistakes every now and then as well, but some people at master/legend level still have skills of a semi-pro.  Combine everything together and you'll have an excellent and balanced game with a few annoying possibilities due to Psyonix dictating what maps you sometimes have to play in non-ranked, but the public players are what ruin the experience and fun on higher levels.
7647	0	a	This game sucks. Couldn't be bothered for more than 2 matches.
7648	0	a	I pay 20$ for this game!!! The servers of Rocket League are very lagged!!! I´m not a good player and i play whit guys VERY GOOD!!! This is ridiculess!!! The game is good but but if you are not a good player i don´t reccomend the game...

7650	0	a	This game makes me cancer
7651	0	a	Extremely fun game, lots of excitement to be had.  Unfortunately, it is also home to a toxic troll-happy community that essentially ruins the game. In good conscience, knowing how bad the community is I cannot recommend this game, which is unfortunate because it has so much potential.  
7652	0	a	Very ♥♥♥♥♥♥. Wasted money... I can't play the game, because when i join a game in my region and with an ether net connection i still lag spike and my net is strong.
7653	0	a	Trading glitch happening!!! I saw an item and was trading someone for it. Then it wasn't in my inventory. I have tried reaching out to the creators of Rocket League. I hope someone contacts me. Someone by the name of [physique] narwhal did this visual glitch and acknowledged that it happened and won't return the items. I am really upset this game doesn't have a way of better suppoprt or fixing the problem as it, as real currency is used for keys and then we get something good and can be scammed....

7659	0	a	The game itself is awesome...but the online play is sooooooooooooooo glitchy. Either they have totally missed a bug that lets other people mess with your connection or their servers are just really really bad. Either way, the gameplay is very different online and infinitely frustrating.
7660	0	a	This would be a nice game if matchmaking worked. Right now it's totally random/broken so I can't recommend it. You will need to have several friends who play the game to team up with if you ever want to climb in rank/win anything.
7661	0	a	i freaking returnd it but didnt get my money back
7662	0	a	The game is fine.   It's just that most people that I have been matched with have been sooky ♥♥♥♥♥ that leave the game after 20 seconds beacuse the other team score a goal early. I am then left in a 1 v 2/3 for the rest of the game.  PLAY WITH FRIENDS.
7663	0	a	This game was fun... Until it stopped working. Whenever i start nothing happens I will post a thumbs up If it WORKS again
7664	0	a	Neat concept, didn't like how it controls.

7666	0	a	Too addictive and engaging. Sucks the life out of you. 1/10 would not recommend unless you have no life
7667	0	a	Think of a football/soccer field that instead of players on the field, there are cars instead and there are no rules you have to follow as there is no referee. That is Rocket league.  I personally didnt like it as its not my type of game but not everyones me so watch a bit of gameplay and if you like the looks of it, give it a go.
7668	0	a	Fun when goal is your's Matchmaking system is wrong, too much time to get a match. Gaming gets boring when u play 2 games and more.
7669	0	a	|| I can't play the game since; i don't know 2-3 months? Still no response, still unplayable. || Update: I have resolved all of my issues by myself- without help of devs or any one at rocket league, they are really giving _____ about bugreports. Thanks. (It runs all good for now after tried several things.)
7670	0	a	What is this massive hatred hard-on you have for keyboards, good god. I have a gaming mouse and keyboard so the 'too many actions' is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Half of my actions I WANT to do don't actually happen, non-existent. Another portion of the time while trying to double jump to hit the ball, it either rolls the opposite direction or the ball physically passes through my 'entity.' The ping is a serious matter as well, I have an average of 44 ping and with that, my actions are still delayed at the rate of 110+ ms. The hell are you trying to make, a salt machine?
7671	0	a	♥♥♥♥.

7673	0	a	Pros: -the idea itself is great -game mechaincs and controls are good -you start with all basic cars unlocked, and only get cosmetics for playing , so no performance increase-&gt;it's fair -you can make plays  Cons: -matchmaking is broken (the wait is too much for a 5-minute game, sometimes insane ping(300ms+), and sometimes i have to wait for minutes sitting alone/almost alone on a server) -in general you only get into a game by the time matchmaking is considering ALL skill levels, and this usually leads to unbalanced matches -the community is disappointing in randoms (toxic people, leavers)  Verdict: If you are a solo player don't buy it, but if you got some friends to play with, you shoud consider it escpecially when it's on sale.
7674	0	a	  this game is a scam i just bought it for 3 weeks and now i cant play it anymore when i wanted to play it i received error 71 as it says:unable to connect to the game i'm really very angry. and when i searched on google for how to fix error 71 in rocket league, i saw many of people have this error and they're not satisfied of this game.

I do not know what it can be connected, but what did you do with the game? Hear me, dear developers, you did a wonderful game that I really liked to play but now it became unbearable.

Online works great but if you cant do splitscreen right not a large number of cheap high quality fun games under £20 with local 4 player splitsreen can offer on pc then dont do it at all

7694	0	a	  Disclaimer: I received this game as a gift from a friend.  I wanted to write a positive review, but frankly, a paid game with microtransactions in it gets an automatic downvote.  A case could be made that RL allows one to disable the 'crates'. Or perhaps a case could be made that RL is 'only' $20 (as opposed to some 'AAA' games that do that). And an argument could be made that the developers never promised NOT to put microtransactions in (unlike Payday 2 developers).  Well, sure. And perhaps some peple will be swayed by such arguments. But I think microtransactions in fully priced games are utter garbage, poison, excrement and bile, and I must downvote on principle alone.
7695	0	a	The server just became too laggy in the last update... when I first bought the game it was in the free week, it was running smoothly. Now we just can't hit the ball cuz it is teleporting in front of us...

7697	0	a	I love this game I've put a lot of hours into it I've invested a lot of extra money in dlc and crates  What I don't love is the 'free' non-standard arenas they keep coming out with I pretty much dislike every arena that has come out since this games release I play only competitive mode because it lowered the frequency at which I got those maps Now since last patch, I get non standard maps the majority of the time  Get with it Psyonix! The game was not broke, stop trying to add to it with these silly maps please, they only take away from the game.

7701	0	a	As of, 31/08/2016 DO NOT BUY/PLAY THIS GAME!  The game itself is very good, but the servers are absolutely ♥♥♥♥ right now! I get on a european server, 12-18 ping constant... (either constant 12/13/14/15/16/17/18) When I play and I lag all over the place, making it completely un-playable, doubles it gets better and solo's it get better, but however if I even dare play 3's or the devil like (chaos mode, 4 cars) it's practically pointless even joining the lobby.  It happens in, ranked and normals, playing ranked and then their team scores a goal because it's impossible to play.  However it does seem like in a game of 2v2's only 2-3 people will get the lag, 2 of which will get it extremely badly and 1 will get minor lag spikes, leaving 1 player totally un-affected. I have played the odd game when I've had 0 lag spikes with perfect ping and everyone else in the game is complaining about it. -I'd suggest unless you want to buy it and play custom, against bots. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! Or unless the devs release a statement that they're getting attacked and that's why their servers are laggy.  In addition, I've played against people that have said they're NEVER experienced lag, but this was when I started to change up the servers thinking it was the European server, but then other people from those servers have said they are experiencing lag too. Overall, fix your ♥♥♥♥ then maybe considering buying this game.

7706	0	a	Rocket League is a great concept.  Rocket League is fun...for the most part.  The A.I. for this game is so biased and unfair. When my friends and I play 2v2 we are amazing and usually win, or come close. When we play 3v3 or 4v4 with A.I. we get smashed (10-2) or similar. The other teams A.I. always knows where to be and when to be there. Our teammate(s) just park somewhere and sniff fuel fumes, until we are on the verge of scoring and then swoop in and screw up our plan/goal.   Also, the game would be much better if the seasons and training were co/op. The only choices you have with friends are to play against A.I. (you already know my feelings with this) or go online and get annihilated by people that have 1000 hrs on record. No middle ground.   So at the end of the day, the game boils down to being a great concept and a fun time if you want to put in thousands of hours to get good, and want to lose 99% of the games you play. I do not recommend the game unless you love being frustrated.

7711	0	a	Great game, have played it since it came out, concept is so unique. Only now have i started playing the Competitive gamemode, and after playing 10 games received the rank of Prospect Elite, Division 4. Won a few more games and managed to boost my ranking to Challenger I, Division 4. And for a few more games, winning and losing, my rank stayed the same. Right, now here's where my review turns bad, and i point out the obvious flaws in the Rocket League ranking system. If you intend on starting the competitive gamemode, i urge you not to, as i have experienced first hand how abnormally frustrating it is to get deranked SO easily after working SO hard to achieve a high and respectable rank. As a Challenger I, playing with a friend of the same skill level (if not better) than myself, the games were very even, and we were winning as much as we were losing, but my rank stayed the same nonetheless. But after i decided to play with a friend who wasn't quite at the skill level i was, we continued to get pitted against teams that were WAAAAAAAAAY above the standard that my friend was, and thus, he could not keep up. While i love the competitive aspect of the game, it is very difficult to hold back the frustration felt when losing all hard work because the Rocket League ranking system could not match us with people of the same skill level. I worked all the way up to Challenger I, Division 4, and in the space of 6 losing games (including 2 forfeits), i had been deranked all the way back to Prospect Elite, Division 3. I am writing this review to alert not only Rocket League, but also to it's users, of the flawed system. I had just been playing, and won two straight games by forfeit, but for some absurd reason, my rank stayed at Prospect Elite, Division 3. However, after losing the next game (only by 1 goal), MY DAMN RANK WENT DOWN. I will part from this review with a question (capitals intended); WHY DOES MY RANK GO DOWN AFTER LOSING ONE GAME, BUT NOT GO UP AFTER WINNING TWO IN A ROW?!?!?!?  Sincerely,  A very frustrated Rocket League Enthusiast.

7720	0	a	I have 150 hours in the game and I think I can now make a decent 'quick' review on it.  Rocket League is a good game, casually and competitively, but with its flaws. It has a salty community (it's almost impossible to play a game without someone being a ♥♥♥♥) and the servers are very bad (I've experienced lots of lag and lost countless games because of it). I can handle the community by muting everyone but until Psyonix fixes their servers I'll give the game a thumbs down. I'll re-upload a new review once they fix all the connection problems.  PS: Before you say I have a bad Internet connection, my Internet is good and rarely goes down.

7724	0	a	Rocket League is a great concept.  Rocket League is fun...for the most part.  The A.I. for this game is so biased and unfair. When my friends and I play 2v2 we are amazing and usually win, or come close. When we play 3v3 or 4v4 with A.I. we get smashed (10-2) or similar. The other teams A.I. always knows where to be and when to be there. Our teammate(s) just park somewhere and sniff fuel fumes, until we are on the verge of scoring and then swoop in and screw up our plan/goal.   Also, the game would be much better if the seasons and training were co/op. The only choices you have with friends are to play against A.I. (you already know my feelings with this) or go online and get annihilated by people that have 1000 hrs on record. No middle ground.   So at the end of the day, the game boils down to being a great concept and a fun time if you want to put in thousands of hours to get good, and want to lose 99% of the games you play. I do not recommend the game unless you love being frustrated.
7725	0	a	  I got this game as a gift and tried some dozen or so matches. Won few, lost few.   But what is a turn down for me is, that I dont like games where you figh controls. I've never used controller, so this was my first time since I've read everywhere KB + mouse is wrong combo.  As for the game it self, I guess there is skill involved, but I dont see how it could be competitive beyond casual.  Overall it was exactly frustrating experience as I was expecting mainly due to usage of controller, which Ive never been fond of.   Cheers.

7727	0	a	the game was fun but now with the new terms of service it steals and sells your personal information for money
7728	0	a	Right now, I cant recommend this game. They broke it Before the update I was fine, but now, with 50 ping I lag everywhere, I teleport all over the map, I would be in my goal sitting, then suddenly It starts lagging and im in the air near his goal without even moving. One example is that the ball was infront of the other teams goal, I slam it in, suddenly I get teleported back and they get a goal. If they fix their horrible servers, then I will change my review.
7729	0	a	What I can say about this game is that it's enjoyable but aslong as you play it only for fun because if you start playing ranked games and taking them seriously you won't enjoy it since in 10 games only 2 of them is given to you a good team, the rest only trolls and stays AFK the entire game. The community is full of butthurts and kids.
7730	0	a	The takes in the game are really unbalanced as you can purchase cars wwho are heavier with real money. Also i'm a veteran and keep getting matched vs legends/masters/experts.

7738	0	a	Unfortunately the last update really screwed over the matchmaking. Resetting everyones ranks to 0 has people like me (superstar rank last season) playing with people who didnt even play last season or were in prospect ranks.  Its incredibly hard to carry people at those ranks because they chase the ball around knocking away every chance at a good shot you have so you have to find a way to set up your own shots, take those shots, and then if your opponents manage to save it you have to get back to your goal in time to stop them because your teamates are still to busy chasing the ball around.  Unfortunately for me I couldnt get lucky enough to get even few good games so since you didnt keep a single bit of your MMR from last season Im now in prospect 1, the lowest rank in the game. Im certainly not about to grind for another 200 hours and around a thousand games just to get back to where i was last season, and thats only if I can dig my way out of this whole that is prospect 1.  That being said I wont be playing anymore unless they fix the ranking system. If they fix that its a great game and well worth every penny ive put into it.
7739	0	a	This game has gottena lot of hype lately. It's a decent game. But not worth buying. First and foremost are wacky physics. A 'sports' game with bad physics just isn't worth it. The ball itself will take absurd bounces because of the bad physics engine running it. You'll see countless times a ball take a huge bounce when it shouldn't have and some low hops when it should have gone high. This makes it nearly impossible to predict the trajectory of the ball. To me this is a grevious sin in a sports game and makes this not worth getting.   If you have some friends that will play with you go for it, maybe you'll have fun together. But as a single player experience this game is more frustrating than fun, more luck than skill, more random than consistent. Don't fall prey to the hype.

7746	0	a	Great game, have played it since it came out, concept is so unique. Only now have i started playing the Competitive gamemode, and after playing 10 games received the rank of Prospect Elite, Division 4. Won a few more games and managed to boost my ranking to Challenger I, Division 4. And for a few more games, winning and losing, my rank stayed the same. Right, now here's where my review turns bad, and i point out the obvious flaws in the Rocket League ranking system. If you intend on starting the competitive gamemode, i urge you not to, as i have experienced first hand how abnormally frustrating it is to get deranked SO easily after working SO hard to achieve a high and respectable rank. As a Challenger I, playing with a friend of the same skill level (if not better) than myself, the games were very even, and we were winning as much as we were losing, but my rank stayed the same nonetheless. But after i decided to play with a friend who wasn't quite at the skill level i was, we continued to get pitted against teams that were WAAAAAAAAAY above the standard that my friend was, and thus, he could not keep up. While i love the competitive aspect of the game, it is very difficult to hold back the frustration felt when losing all hard work because the Rocket League ranking system could not match us with people of the same skill level. I worked all the way up to Challenger I, Division 4, and in the space of 6 losing games (including 2 forfeits), i had been deranked all the way back to Prospect Elite, Division 3. I am writing this review to alert not only Rocket League, but also to it's users, of the flawed system. I had just been playing, and won two straight games by forfeit, but for some absurd reason, my rank stayed at Prospect Elite, Division 3. However, after losing the next game (only by 1 goal), MY DAMN RANK WENT DOWN. I will part from this review with a question (capitals intended); WHY DOES MY RANK GO DOWN AFTER LOSING ONE GAME, BUT NOT GO UP AFTER WINNING TWO IN A ROW?!?!?!?  Sincerely,  A very frustrated Rocket League Enthusiast.

7772	0	a	Obviously a very popular game, the idea is fantasticly simple and fun. Unfortunately what really lets it down is how laggy online games can be. I'm in the UK and I throw a lot of money at my internet connection, yet a significant portion of the games are just so dissapointing due to constant lag glitching. Don't get me wrong you will get games where everyone has a decent ping and you get a fantasticly responsive game out of it, but there are far more games in which you will find players, yourself and the ball glitching around the arena like in games from the dial up era.  If the match finder had a way to filter out people with slow connections then I would definitely recommend this game, unfortunately the best you can do is filter by region so you are always going to get matched with kids playing on terrible broadband wirelessly forty feet from their routers with several walls sitting between them.

7809	0	a	Well done Rocket League team... this time you finally destroyed the game. With over 600+ hours this game is getting worse and worse... each update adding new stupid maps and noooo way to not play them,   Of course yes the game is fun no doubt about that... But when you have over 300+ hours in it you begin to play for some nice goals and teamplay, but allmost every single new map has stupid structure, hidden bumbs so the ball will go another way etc,   And besides all that, allmost every solo que is going to be 'new stupid map' or some idiot farming crates with a bot' (unranked)  Dont even wanna talk about ranked. . . . . . . .   PLZ Rocket team.... make the game great again
7810	0	a	Devs have decided to remove the Rocket Labs playlist, where all the weird 'test' maps were, and force them into the regular game mode, where in my opinion they don't belong at all. I accepted the previous few maps without making a fuss since they were fairly vanilla all things considered, but deciding to dump all the extreme test maps in classic mode despite knowing full well the negative reaction it would bring feels like a massive middle finger on their part.  Players have asked countless times for the option to choose what maps they want to play on, a feature which would make everyone happy with no negative effects whatsoever, but the devs still didn't give us anything besides a likes and dislikes system, which doesn't prevent unwanted maps from showing up anyways.  As fun as the game can be when not thrown into horribly bad maps, until they give players the freedom of choice i will not recommend it to anyone, and i hope a thumbs down will be a more effective way to get devs to listen to the negative feedback than posts on a forum which they don't seem to read.
7811	0	a	EDIT: In addition to all the stuff below, the game now constantly crashes, cannot complete 2 matches in a row sometimes game crashes every match.   They really ruined a great thing. I can never have faith in this game again, it's always 'about to crash' and it ... just sucks to play.    Previous review below!  Earlier I said this was a great game, but could easily be ruined by a crappy update. Well it's happened! the game play mechanics are still solid. That hasnt changed.   THE MATCHMAKING SUCKS SO  BAD NOW  so bad.   so so bad.    Gone are the games I worked hard to compete in, where veterans and masters and experts battled it out in fun unranked matches. Now it's constantly 4 beginner ranks and 2 medium rank players. And those beginners make the game ♥♥♥♥.   literally the game is not fun any more. I just get more and more frustrated and have less and less of a good time each time I try to log on and play.   I DO NOT RECOMMEND THAT ANYONE BUYS THIS GAME. As it is, it's terrible. It's not a fun experience.      You know this game, right? Well, pretty much everything you've heard is well deserved. The gameplay is great, the controls, options, graphics, are all done right.   The learning curve is really really good, and even after you get past your initial sucky-ness there is a lot of depth for improvement, in many aspects. And if you're a replay geek like me, the watch replay feature is awesome (one-click to save instantly, and good playback options).  Sure, you can and do get douchey people in some games, but, it's a mp game so, that's part online gaming. I simply mute people sooner rather than later and do my thing. Matchmaking could be better but games generally pop very very quickly.   The only thing to watch for, is a game like this could easily be ruined by a crazy update. And the dev is still adding major updates every so often. But as it is now... great stuff.    I could say more but, just, I recommend it!! Buy it!! 
7812	0	a	Rocket League was an awesome game but the devs just can't leave well enough alone. They are determined to ruin the game by forcing unwanted bizarre maps into it. The gameplay has only gotten less fun since I got the game due to this. Not only that but they keep making the performance worse by making new maps with more garbage animations going on in the background that have nothing to do with the gameplay at all and not providing performance optimizations to turn off those animations, be they smoke or water or whatever.  Psyonix is just going to run this game into the ground by chasing away the players that like it as it is until there's none left.

7816	0	a	The first time I played this game I thought it was neat, a good quick time waster. After a few more matches and a few more hours I fell in love with the gametype and gameplay, there is no other game like this one. I continued to play and even started to become good and joined in on competitive (ranked).   The huge problem I have are with the servers and the connection issues I continue to run into. I found out its called rubberband lag, my initial ping at the start of the game would be completely fine and I have always ran the game at high graphics but then every now and again it would skyrocket to 300 or 400 ping. At first I thought it could be my router or perhaps my computer, but no it is the servers. I have even searched to see if other people have had this problem and I come to find that it is a major issue.  The servers and lag make this game extremely frustrating to play, especially when you are 2 goals ahead and then the lag hits and your car seems to be jumping all over the map. It makes this game almost unplayable.
7817	0	a	I really want to recommend this game but I can't. I've been playing almost since day one and if I was writing this review back then, i would be recommending it. The game is incredibly fun but quality has been steadily declining since it was released. When the game was first released, you could get into a match instantly and ping was great. I consistently had less than 10ms ping. Now it takes a few minutes to get into a match (even though there are more people playing) and ping has been steadily increasing with every update they do to the game. I'm lucky if I can get into a server with a ping least than 40ms. Even though 40 ping isn't bad, it is way to high for a game that is highly dependent on reaction time and precise maneuvers. I also never had any issues running this game. It always ran flawlessly. It wasn't until recently that my game started crashing randomly, and having two crashes in the matter of 15 minutes is what motivated me to write this review.  On another note, the physics are flawed. When I first started playing Rocket League the physics felt great and seems super realistic (minus pinching the ball), but as I played the game more and more, I started to notice that the physics don't react proper in a lot of situations. I don't know for sure what is wrong but it seems like there is no friction at all and the ball's momentum reacts very strange at times. Collisions between vehicle make no sense to me. It seems completely random what happens when you hit someone else or when someone hits you. I have tapped someone and sent them flying to the moon and I have slammed someone at full speed and been stopped dead in my tracks. And whenever you get hit your car just arbitrarily spins, killing any momentum you had when you were hit.   I feel like Psyonix doesn't care about the quality of the game anymore and they are just pushing more and more new content. Don't get me wrong, I love everything they have added and basketball is (in my opinion) way better than soccer, but it feels like they are neglecting the quality that the game once had. They keep releasing all these car packs but it doesn't feel like they are fixing any of the problems with the game like the matchmaking.  I love this game, but it is slowly falling out of my favorites. Ultimately, I can't recommend it but I will be more than happy to change my review if Psyonix brings the game back to what it use to be.  ----------------------------------- There are a couple more things I want to note about this game but they did not influence my recommendation for this game since they are related to the community and not Psyonix directly. This will probably sound like a rant more than anything, but these things need to be said.  The community for this game is awful to put it bluntly. I occasionally get good matches with people who are fun and respectful and we have a blast, but then there are matches where your entire team leaves if you get scored on in the first 5 seconds or people are being disrespectful to each other. In ranked matches, I've had people totally blow up on me for making a mistake. I understand playing competitively and wanting to win. Nobody likes losing, but people need to remember it's just a game and losing is part of any game.   Something needs to be done about the people who leave mid-game. Banning people doesn't fix anything. Implementing a system that separates quitters and non-quitters might be beneficial. This system would track everyone and how often they leave matches before they are over. When you search for matches it will try to put you into a game with a similar quitting-levels so that quitters play together and non-quitters play together. Obviously this is very black and white and an actual implementation wouldn't be this crude, but I think a system like this could be a step in the right direction.  Rocket League is a difficult game. I have put many hours into it and I'm still pretty mediocre at it. The only way to get better is to play the game more. When you quit, you are losing valuable game time that could help improve your own skills. I take more from matches where I lost than matches where I won. When you are beat, it gives you a chance to analyze what you did wrong and makes you better. This goes along with the old saying, 'Quitters never win and winners never quit.'
7818	0	a	 tl;dr version:  Very good basic game, but still lacking a lot of polish and features. Feels a bit EA, still, in that regard. Recommendable for private play, where it plays out as fun as any multiplayer arena game- but absolutely not recommendable for public play, where frequent server issues, an overwhelmingly toxic and exploitative community, numerous unresolved bugs and design flaws, and lousy matchmaking all make for a game that is more often than not very disagreeable to play.  ~ ~ ~  Great game, offering a blend of childhood marbles like physics fun, racing hijinks, soccer gameplay, and even arena brawling. It's a game that's inherently easy to pick up, play, and enjoy, and really, plays just the way you'd expect it to from the videos and screenshots, no disappointments in that regard. So really, if it looks at all interesting to you, you should pick it up!   ..wait, or not.   For a good while now, there've been some significant issues in the game that the developers have failed to address in any way, and it mars an otherwise solid game.  * Horribly toxic community, seemingly no oversight by the devs in that regard. You can mute the players for that single match, but it doesn't carry over to any other match, or prevent regrouping with them. It also doesn't address other abusive gameplay elements- idling (for drops) is a key example, being so common that you're bound to bump into it after just a couple of runs (and during the holiday events, expect this to be nearly every run) There are a lot of amazingly capable and fun and positive players in this game, and if the developers approached things with any degree of oversight, this might actually be one of the better communities in an online game. Unfortunately, as with any MMO where toxic individuals understand that there are no punishments for acting out, what should be a minor occurance has wildfired.  Doesn't help that the report function no longer allows you to report users once they leave a match, so you'll sometimes get people deliberately sabotaging their team, spewing a bunch of curses, and then ragequitting. On the other hand, when I've discussed reporting users to other players, the positive-minded players gave a clear impression of 'it's useless, the devs won't do anything' while the negative-minded ones laughed and- well, said the same thing. So that's clearly the biggest issue of it all.  * Input recognition failures, flip recognition failures, ability activation failures, contact recognition glitches- most of these issues can be explained by server issues that've persisted (and in many ways, only grown worse) since the Rumble release some time back. But they're common, and they're going to bite you in the ♥♥♥ at least a couple of times each match, most matches. Some matches are completely unplayable because of these issues.   * Joining in-progress matches doesn't prevent you from rejoining a match you left (due to toxic players), and despite a recent patch, still spawns you in at very disadvantageous circumstances, often leading you to run right into the ball upon spawn, sending it as-often-as-not into your own goal.   * Rumble mode is unpolished, with several minor quirks. Most notably, the inability to properly target with targeted abilities and their often switching targets as you activate them, can cause you to inadverently help your opponents, rather than hinder them.   * General modes don't use any sort of ranking system to make sure you get decent matches, or even matches to your skill level, so it's always a complete crapshoot to lobby up. On the other hand, ranked modes are based on the (in my opinion) very subpar 3v3 mode (if that was all the game had, I wouldn't actually recommend it- due to the size of most of the arenas, and the sometimes glitchy physics, it's too easy in standard 3v3 to get a lucky shot into a goal).   Mind you, this isn't really a flaw with 3v3 itself, but with the maps used for 3v3 (which are typically better designed for 4v4). Hoops, the basketball mode, also suffers from being better suited for 3v3 play (and a slightly larger map) than for 2v2. Meanwhile, on the opposite side of things, Hockey (3v3) lacks the physics glitches of normal 3v3, due to its hockey-puck shaped ball, and works fabulously in 3v3. Rumble (the mode with activatable abilities) is crazy enough to get by in 3v3 as well, and Chaos (4v4) is the ideal team play mode, working far better with most maps than 3v3 does.  So, the option is to play standard ranked (which you can't easily leave without closing client the way- which in a way is understandable, but also makes bad public groupings all the more painful. Definitely do ranked with a team of players you're comfortable with, rather than public grouping it.), or to play unranked matches with no meaningful matchmaking system at all, but far better mechanics and balancing.  At least from my perspective and preferences, the game is lacking a lot of polish.  * Outside of holiday drops, and the game's premium chests, cosmetic drops appear to have been reduced to very rare drop rates along with the Rumble update a while back. If you enjoy unlocking cosmetics (and in this game, you can trade in sets of 5 cosmetics for a random cosmetic of one higher rarity tier, so it's rather enjoyable) expect that appeal to be rarely encountered. On the other hand, chests seem plentiful enough, so if you're into purchasing your cosmetics, hey, the devs would be glad for your funds. Which, y'know, isn't so bad- except all the premium cosmetics are the most gaudy, shiny, flashy things the devs can come up with. If you want anything that's actually stylish, coordinated, subdued, subtle, or otherwise not mid-life-crisis or teenager-making-a-statement, then you'll need to grind those non-premium drops to get something appealing.     The game is fantastic, no doubt. And when you get good pairings, it's a calculated sports game, with all the appeal of a racing game throwin in, with fabulous teamwork potential. Other than the above issues, and still lacking a bit of variety in modes and maps, the game is thoroughly solid.  So I'll gladly swap this to a positive review in an instant- as soon as the devs at least give firm indication that they care about the general gameplay of the game as much as they do their premium leagues.  That's not me being petty with my review, but a simple fact to the rating system Steam uses: While I can definitely say I enjoy this game, I can't at all say I  recommend  it in its current state. There's just too much frustration in it.  Then again, if you avoid the public gameplay altogether, and just play on teams fully crewed by friends? If you view this as that kind of game, rather than as a public MMO, then by all means, this game is recommendable.  In fact, inherently I'd put this among the topmost games in both sports and arena brawlers, comparable to any of the best ones out there (except for the lack of polish in some areas, and with having less scale than most sports games, and having less variety of content than most arena brawlers).  If you're intending this for play with friends, either in closed groups or in a ranked team, then I highly recommend giving this game a go. If you're in for the public gameplay aspect, then it all boils down to how easily you're frustrated by toxic MMO communities and bad servers, compounded with other minor stresses.  Personally, I end up leaving one play session out of four deeply satisfied- and the remaining three stressed and exhausted, from a game that was meant to relax me.
7819	0	a	Rocket League is getting unlockable crates  Fk me time to find a new game   On the flip side   'Those things: •Crates will contain cosmetic content only. We have a strict 'Don't Sell Advantage' policy for Rocket League, and we're sticking with that. •There will be no Steam Marketplace integration with crates. We are definitely aware of the problems related to third-party gambling in other games and we are not interested in taking that approach. •Players who don't want to interact with this system can hide it entirely with a single checkbox. Also of note, this won't affect or impact our current item-drop system in any way.'  atlest there items can NOT be sold on the Market place
7820	0	a	The game is a lot of fun. The matchmaking is absolutely awful.
7821	0	a	OK! The game is fun and good gameplay but this ♥♥♥♥ ranking system is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off. I win one game when i play against opponets with my own ranking and level in game and after i win i play vs veteran, pro, expert and they are much higher rank. This happens all the time so if you just want to have fun this game is good but if you want to have fun and still try to rank up/become an overall better player i wouldnt recomend it.
7822	0	a	Saw it and for long time i tought it isnt nearly as fun as people advertise it to be. Looks didnt exactly help. Again, i was wrong. Bloody fun game and rather easy to learn  EDIT! after playing it long time, i have to say this game is not worth it. It is fun, but not if you are constantly being egged and insulted by teammates who cant even ♥♥♥♥ing hit the ball and you lose over and over again because ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ matchmaking is ♥♥♥♥ and pairs you with named players while opponents are usually good....
7823	0	a	This game is extremely fun. It's identical to a game a friend and me built in starmade called Power Ball, the customization of the vehicles is amazing, and the fact that the devs give every new arena away for free is AWESOME. The only things that you have to pay for, are different vehicles (that aren't better in anyway other than looks) and some skins / special effects for your vehicle.  If you aren't playing with friends..... beware. The only problem with this game is a good portion of players. PS4 modded consoles, where the game instantly wins before the 3 seconds timer is up, and TONS and TONS of afkers. There currently isn't a system in place to kick these people, or ban them from item farming (just sitting afk in a match doing circles or moving forward to get the chance of an item when the match finishes).  There's no reporting systems for the PS4 network, if they do happen to cheat. So it's really just a, play at your own risk, and realize that every 4 or so matches, you're going to get people afking, or helping opposing team.
7824	0	a	I used to love this game a lot. There is so much to love about it. That was until the crate system was introduced...   &lt;crate_rant&gt;  Now I drop into a game and with fair regularity you end up with a crate farmer on one side or the other. There was that one epic time that I dropped into a game and the whole other team was crate farming...   Please dev's you need to rethink the crate system to put off farming it just ruins it for everyone. A friend pointed out that he didn't see it as much at expert level games and of course when he teamed up with friends. This makes me think maybe it's worse at the lower levels which is not good for the overall health of the game.   If you're new and your first experience of the game is some dude driving around in circles seems like a receipe for peeps finding something else to play.  &lt;/crate_rant&gt;   Anyways, apart from the crate system keep up the good work, this game is well worth the time and effort so long as you don't end up with a farmer on your team :)  edit: My spelling of crate left a lot to be desired. Seriously sick of this crate farming ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥rt almost every game seems to have farmers.
7825	0	a	♥♥♥♥♥iest matchmaking system I've ever seen in a ♥♥♥♥ing game.
7826	0	a	It´s a great game, but there is no report button for when players leave a ranked game, because they are salty that we are 1 goal behind.
7827	0	a	Worth for money spend but recent updates made the games go bat ♥♥♥♥.. Lag,network problem everything. Please do make good server with a decent ping rate...
7828	0	a	Used to love this game. Had to quit playing for a bit because of school. Came back, and now their servers are pretty bad. Nothing changed about my local connection, but my ping went from med 20s to high 80's constantly, with large spurts of lag. It's no longer playable. Sadly, I no longer reccommend this game.
7829	0	a	Pros: Great game to play with friends  Cons: You have to have friends who play this game because everyone online is going to A. Kick your ♥♥♥. or B. Be your Austistic Teammates   10/10 would ranked again
7830	0	a	♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ teammates + &gt;200ms ping = rocket league
7831	0	a	DONT BUY THIS GAME !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! You Spend Hours Playing And Practising For Nothing. You And Your Team Member Play So Good All The Way Through And Then Theres Something That Start To Play In The Coding!! ' Rocket League Assist' This Gives The Opposing Team The Chance To Score And Easy Goal Making Your Car Unable To Hit The ♥♥♥♥ing Ball When U Know Damn Right You Hit It. THIS GAME HAS CHANGED IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS TO WORST... FULL OF SCRUBS FULL OFF ♥♥♥♥♥ MOUTHING OFF UNFAIR MATCHES WHEN U KNOW DAMN WELL YOU TOUCHED IT BUT THE GAME SAYS NO 'ROCKET LEAGUE ASSIST' ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T NOT WORTH THE MONEY OR TIME PUTTING INTO IT. Ive Spent 300 Hours Practising and I Can Almost Freestyle and Hit It Perfect. But Like I Said This Past Month Has Been Dogshit. The Game Assists The Team That Is Loosing And Its Not Fun At All Anymore. Sort It Out. a quick add to this game Players Such as Twirl, Yes Im Calling You Out. its not funny to tell people to go die of cancer.. Players like this ruin the game
7832	0	a	The game's good but the developers simply stopped giving a ♥♥♥♥ about community feedback when they got rich.
7833	0	a	  Here is why you should buy the game: Good concept / Good community Here is why you shouldent: The devs of this game stated when it launched that they wouldent even put dlc into the game, now we have keys which have gone from 1.00$ to 1.50$ which is insane that they would increase something already making them a ton of money
7834	0	a	Do Not Purchase.  When people wish not to play a particular map, and then do what they can to avoid it, they force you to play it by issuing bans for the practice of getting out of it.  If people don't want to play something, don't make them.  What killed this game mostly for me is the addition of the map 'Wasteland' to competitive. I joined competitive matches to avoid wasteland and to play people of my skill level (even though it wasn't spot on equal, it was better than the amount of 'pro' players I see in Casual (who are playing in teams, fully coordinated). So because I dislike wasteland that much, still to this day months and months after it was released, and then it being put into ranked play, I can no longer choose to play the game as I did when I first purchased it. Psyonix only issued bans to people who didn't want to play the map (which MANY were very unhappy with).  The Competitive mode is flawed and unfair -  Due to ranked play needing a consistancy to be fair, and getting the wasteland map randomly. Player A could get wasteland 20 times in a day, compared to; Player B could get wasteland 3 times day. There is no consistancy there, the maps are different shapes, you have to play different on the different maps, and not everyone plays the same map the same amount of times. Ranked is officially flawed due to the style in which the maps are selected.  This is my warning to you that the game will change, and the developers do not care if you like it or not. They got their money from you. and that's that.
7835	0	a	Honstly its a piece of ♥♥♥♥ and u will rage people will get so god damn lucky with scoring and have no ♥♥♥♥ing skill what so ever theres no point if you arnt ♥♥♥♥ing lucky
7836	0	a	It was by the beautiful, but the updates of the game is no longer as it was this game that you've destroyed
7837	0	a	I have massively enjoyed this game up until the most recent patch. Until now, the DLC system for this game has been great - cosmetic packs of a couple cars and accessories. However, the newest update brings in a crate system, which locks a ton of new content behind gambling away real money. Personally, I can't recommend a game that does something like this, especially after they've had a perfectly good system in place.
7838	0	a	With a bad ranking system, expensive price, and the fact that it doesn't take very long to get old and repetetive, I chose to write a negative review for this game.  BEFORE YOU READ:  I like this game, but to me the negatives outweigh the positives. Its a cool idea, it really is. The execution is where I have quite a few problems. I could have easily written a positive review for this game, but I didn't choose to do so.  POSITIVES:  - Decent graphics - Lots of cosmetics - Not any noticable bugs  NEGATIVES:  - Gets old very fast with few gametypes - Cross-Platform, so instantly PC players are better due to inferior console controls - Ranking system that relies more on levels than ranks - Expensive Price (20$, which is pretty ambiguous coming from a indie company and a steam game...) - SAME FREAKING SONG EVERY TIME YOU OPEN THE GAME (jk I still love you...)  OVERALL:  This game tries to be competetive, which is where it fails most. I'd say at the least its a fun casual game, but personally I don't think I could ever get into this game like I do with games like CS:GO or Overwatch. Decent title, but far too overpriced as mentioned before. All in all, buy it on sale and have a fun night with your friends, but don't expect to dedicate all of your time to it since it gets bland fast.  
7839	0	a	Not very fun if you try to do any kind of competitiveness in the game. Playstyles are usually one of 3 styles with the 2 being pseudo-strikers which is destructive to establishing any kind of teamwork in the game. But seeing the effectiveness of these 'idle until I can goal' playstyles is rather infuriating when it shows to defeat the purpose of the base teamwork design of the game.  Very fun with friends, but trying to take this game as anything close to competitive is a complete joke for those seasoned in being a competitive nut.  Other issues include the main menu music, frame lag (counter-acted by the wonderful arsenal of visual modifiers you can apply to the game thanks to the good devs at Psyonix), and extremely fluctuating queue times.  I reccomend it, but I didn't like it. Not my cup of tea but I can imagine it's a lot of other peoples.  Note. I bought this game on the Humble Monthly, it was on my wishlist for a while so when the nice lads at Humble Bumble and Psyonix basically had it on sale for 40% less. I bought it without a doubt.
7840	0	a	  I played Rocket League during the free weekend. It is not a bad game. It is polished, straightforward, easy to get into and difficult to master. It is a good game.  But it is boring.  When I played it, I played on and off for two-three days. I had some fun moments, but what you see is what you get. There is nothing more, nothing less, and I find that Rocket League gets dull after a few hours. It is possible that you can really get into the game, looking up strats and practising advanced techniques, but all those things aside - nothing changes. While some people can deal with that and still find it enjoyable, I can't. There is not enough in Rocket League to keep my attention, which is why I can't personally recommend it.
7841	0	a	Keeps ♥♥♥♥ing crashing at startup after the new patch
7842	0	a	worst matchmaking ever 21/10 ♥♥♥♥

7847	0	a	Gay game full of ret4rds on one side and cheaters with unlimited boost on other I f@cking hope that this will be helpfull to others who want to buy this game This is the most ret4rded game in history of games, worse than the games who are worth 0.59€ Dont waste your money on this stupid, game you wont get anything unless you cheat nor you will have good time playing with ret4rds on your team, and creators of this game made this game so easy to hack so if you want to see a good example of cheating it's this game so good luck if you want to rage and break keyboard or table  P.S. You are gays Psyonix, make game with better wall against cheaters and a little bit leveled by skill because any ret4rd can buy accunt and play like f@cking imbecil like he is  P.P.S. I think you are gays working in Psyonix, just gays f@cking each other and game was created when someone hit the guy with his d1ck hard in head so he came up to this idea, f@cking gays, GAYS!   Yours faithfully, ELEMENT
7848	0	a	Removed the autistic butt ♥♥♥♥er japanese map with the hills and ♥♥♥♥ in it. Especially from ranked play ♥♥♥♥ing sucks.
7849	0	a	This game is amazing when played on anything but a mac. When played with a controller on any other platform (pc, PS) the game is amazing and I really recommend it but it is impossible to play this game with a keyboard or a mac.
7850	0	a	Excellent game, very addictive, especially with friends but the ranking system is utterly broken!  Please Psyonix copy the ranking system of CS:Go and skip this linear ranking system which gets abused by smurfers and on-purpose-downrankers !     &gt;&gt;&gt; How it works now:  High rank + Low rank (two friends in the same lobby, one player is downranking on purpose by leaving matches with foreign players) will end up with low-mid rank enemies.    &gt;&gt;&gt; How it should be:   High rank + low rank = high rank enemies    Today they reset the ranks of all players, great job Psyonix! Have fun playing against Allstar opponents, as a silver guy.
7851	0	a	You think the Dota 2 community is toxic?  You have seen nothing... try out Rocket League.
7852	0	a	I loved rocket league A LOT. I played it pretty much since it came out on PC, but with the recent actions from Psyonix and now the crate and key system being shoved into the game. I'm not going to play this game anymore and have uninstalled.   I don't regret the time I put into this game, I just wish they didn't ♥♥♥♥ing ruin it like this.
7853	0	a	it was good until they put the case's - keys ..should back to dlc better ♥♥♥♥ing greed
7854	0	a	This game used to be a ton of fun and you had the deep urge to practise and learn the new move another player made online or get better in general. Each game is different that´s what made you play for way too long and the 'just one more' principles is what this game mastered for me, BUT the last update is a joke... the developer have those 'Rocket Labs' maps and nobody is really playing them because they are just straight ♥♥♥♥ to play seriously, i mean if youre looking for a nice and funny time they´re fine but since the last update you HAVE to play them even if you don´t want to. And these maps being absolut crap which psyonix makes you play, because those maps don´t get love otherwise, isn´t the only problem. The biggest problem is not only you don´t want to play them, neither does everyone else! If you join in a game with those maps most of the time one entire team is leaving. I mean i don´t know how this is in lower ranks but in higher ranks, where you evantually will get, EVERYONE hates those maps and leaves right at the beginning of the game. You could argue now 'But you can set Map Preferences' and yeah you certanly can, but let´s do simple maths here : you can dislike 2 maps, and there´s 3 rocket labs, wasteland, neo tokyo and aquadome which are all maybe beautiful maps, but for serious games they´re useless. So even if you like 2 of those maps you still have to play 2 you don´t like. And if you disliked a map it´s not even guaranteed it will not show up! It´s only less common, which, in my time of playing, was it will show up 80% of the time! This update is the worst i´ve ever witnessed in any kind of videogame. Changes a great game into one you get tired of from the first minute of playing.

7857	0	a	English:  It's a great game if you want to have a good time, but I gently say that it has an horrible drawback, matchmaking is pure garbage, I've ranked down from Challenger 1 to Prospect 3 in just 2 days at 3v3 solo. It seems really impossible to rank up back in ranked games if you don't play well or if your teammates haven't more to give.  I've already uninstalled it before it gives me a heart attack...   Español:  Es muy buen juego si quieres pasar un buen rato, pero voy a decir suavemente una horrible pega que tiene, el matchmaking es una auténtica basura, en 2 días he bajado de Aspirante 1 a Promesa 3 en 3v3 individual. Es imposible ascender de nuevo en ranked si no juegas bien y/o tu equipo no da para más.  Lo acabo de desinstalar para no perder más años de vida...

7866	0	a	Do I really have to resort to this?  Unfortunately I do. RL has a new map, called 'Wasteland.' It is much different than all other fields, as it is curved like a half-pipe. Yes, this COMPLETELY changes the game.  Unfortunately, Psyonix puts this map into the rotation just like any other map; including ranked mode.  It absolutely ruins the game. Devs won't listen. Maybe they will if enough of us downvote.

7870	0	a	Game is fun but hard to master. The servers are really bad and you will get disconnected so often they even have an antennae in the game because they know. Trying to find a new player? Guess again you will be put with a bot first because it takes so long. This game gets a even 5/10. If i could actually play it consistently and without lag then it would be higher.
7871	0	a	the game is not working what i can to do?
7872	0	a	There are A LOT of missing features. Most players seem to play single player with bots and not online. There is no real cross-platform even though 'there is', because you can't play with your friend(s) who use playstation and you use pc. You can't control the camera with your mouse nor with the joystick, the camera is either locked looking where the car is going or at the ball which is a BIG problem, for me at least. You will get bored very fast because there isn't much gameplay. 20-30 hours at most, because it VERY repetitive. Just football and basketball. Kick kick kick kick then what? But if you decide that you really want the game then I encourage you to buy it at the steam sales because it does not worth 20 bucks. Maybe for 10 bucks. And try it :)
7873	0	a	At first this game was really fun, but because of the TERRIBLE matchmaking I am consistently placed with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ teammates in Doubles.
7874	0	a	:)
7875	0	a	Luck based game that requires no skill
7876	0	a	If you are Australian, then you're ♥♥♥♥ed. Australian servers are absolute dog s h i t.

7878	0	a	boring
7879	0	a	This is a pretty good game, but they promised a GNU/Linux version, and more than ONE ♥♥♥♥ING YEAR LATER the game is STILL not on GNU/Linux. I don't want to use Wine to play this, I want a native version. Sadly they rather care about making a million other damn updates instead of making the Mac/Linux versions.
7880	0	a	Fix the f*cking bots, because they're a piece of sh*t: scoring freaking own goals... -.-
7881	0	a	Piece of ♥♥♥♥ game that has so many connection issues. I'd rather drink bleach than play this game.
7882	0	a	Worst ranking system in the world. DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME, YOU WILL ONLY GET MATCHED AGAINST PEOPLE WHO HAVE THOUSANDS MORE HOURS THEN YOU DO.
7883	0	a	Feels like a car flying simulator. As soon as your opponent touches you, you fly. Camera won't allow you to see your opponent. You can only look forward or at the ball.
7884	0	a	I love season 3 where it makes you feel like you're in casual mode. Preranks you in to low division no matter how good your qualifiers are and then keeps you there by matching you with the ♥♥♥♥ teammates you worked to get away from in S1 + S2.  Oh what's that? Your teammate queues for ranked but is afk half the time and leaves mid-round? DIVISION DOWN. Your teammate is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ who purposely scores on his own goal? DIVISION DOWN. You win 5-0 with all goals from you??? ... nothing.  they also added another dumb map and some dlc or something.
7885	0	a	Worst system ever.. Get teamate that leaves after getting 2 golas and got deranks for that.. Do better system and i will recommend this game. I dont recommend this game if you want get bigger ranks and try get the best. Its impossible with these leavers. And the matchmaking system.. I have 25 hours and i play vs guys with 150+ hours. I cant win, for me this game is Losing League
7886	0	a	You like physics? You wanna calculate how the ball will move and act in condition with this? Forget it, it is ♥♥♥♥ing random. At start it was fun, but it turned me out really fast.  Ranked system is a joke, if you win 5 in a row you get nothing, if you lose 1 game you insta lose rank. What the hell? Finally, about DLCs. You have to buy for 4 euros a fkin car? :D I didnt expect that when I bought the game for 20(!) euros. Imo, do not buy the game, there are a lot better games for this much money. Cheers
7887	0	a	Garbage. Ranking system is broken, physics are broken, community is ABSOLUTE cancer. You will win about 3-4 games and go up 1 division, then lose 3 games and lose a division each time deranking you. Never mind the fact that the game places you against wayyyy higher ranks every game. (I am pro and i haven't seen another pro in atleast 20 games. no exageration. I will ALWAYS be placed against masters and veterans) There is no more fun considering im losing most games about 5+ to 0 because I will have terrible players or console kids that dont know what they are doing. The physics are severely broken to the point you will jump up high and forward smack the white out of the ball and it will literally go backwards to your own goal. Never mind the fact that every game will have the guy that gets 3 lucky ♥♥♥ goals from their goal with the random touch that goes 500 trillion miles/hour.   TLDR: This game is broken. don't buy it dont play it. Extrememly unrecommended.
7888	0	a	better servers. me and my friends can almost never play with eachother because at least 3 of us (there is 5 all together) is lagging like ♥♥♥♥ and its really annoying because its a really fun game with friends.
7889	0	a	Has a crate system now.
7890	0	a	what the ♥♥♥♥ have you done to this with the update it takes 20mins find a game or no game at all very disatisfied!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
7891	0	a	If i review this solely based upon the gameplay I would recommend.  HOWEVER, now that there is a large amount of DLC that totals to more than the base game is worth i'm going to say no to recommending this.  Paid DLC is evil and should be destroyed. Rocket league looks to be the next Payday 2 DLC cash grab in my eyes.
7892	0	a	a nice game, with an original gameplay. Played on single player is quite boring and after 1 day you already want to trash it. His force is online, where competitive battles are really exciting. Sadly, the online is also his weakness, with too many frustrated people (kids, most of the time) who can't accept defeat and start to insult everybody (usually their teammates) like they are the only ones good enough to play this game. More you go high in competitive matches, more people like this you'll meet, and then it will start to lose all the fun.  In short: a good game ruined by bad players.
7893	0	a	♥♥♥♥ing game i hate it i win 8/10 rankeds and i am ♥♥♥♥ing PROSPECT 1 i ♥♥♥♥ this GAME REFUND
7894	0	a	A good basic and they are wasting it...  -negative : an every 5 min game play , you can't play it for hours..  Bad servers (high ping)  Bad match making  losing levels (very annoying if you get noobs in your team) (and by noobs i mean those losers who want to   give up after a 0-1 lose )  Very boring off line competition version   Winning boxes and you have to buy keys to open them, so you win nothing, you only buy..  no better car performance, only custumatation  - Positive : if you just have 5 min, you play a quick game  a huge online raking competition game 
7895	0	a	worst ♥♥♥♥ing rage inducing game with lucky morons
7896	0	a	after playing this game for a number of hours (in rank) i came to the conclusion that this game really punishes u if u are a good player. matchmaking is bad and unbalanced if u are trying to climb. It really matches u with people who are just good at fertilizing the earth when they are dead.
7897	0	a	boring a$$ game. i played a few rounds and refunded it. it was already getting repetitive and i was getting rekt by people whom i assume have played for a long amount of time. no ranked matches, from what i experienced. not even worth getting it on sale

7901	0	a	Well the gameplay is fantastic. It gives you all the emotions of a sport, it's mechanically pleasing as a game, and it has a high skill ceiling. The music and visuals are beatiful. The game is well designed all around with one glowing exception: the ranking system. Theoretically you play 2v2 or 3v3 ranked games, getting separate ranks in both. You advance from Prospect to Challanger, throught all the Star ratings to, finally, Champion rankings. More info here:  (Wiki link)  [rocketleague.wikia.com] . But the ranking system in this game doesn't really exist, since  matchmaking will throw a rookie that never played the game with a very, very experienced player . See in this game you have a ranking (Prospect, etc.) and a title (Semi-Pro, Pro, Veteran, Expert, Master). The title depends on how many games you've won, you get experience. You can be a really good player, trying to master the game, no can do, as a Semi-Pro or Pro Prospect will be matched vs Master Challanger Elite. Let me explain this to you: imgaine you just started playing CS:GO and you're playing vs Global Elite. You wouldn't even be able to learn the game, it would make no sense to you, you'd get discouraged and quit. Every bit of fun that you can have in ranked is ruined by these horror matches. If you quit: the penalty is like 10 minutes. Laughable. The better you are, the worse your experience will be. Sure, some people have more patience than others, but please. Consider one thing before buying this game:  (reddit link) . Posted by #1 and #2 in ranked mode: they got there by exploiting the stupidity of matchmaking. They say they clearly don't play well, but they're still ranked the highest. Well, unless they fix this easy to fix problem, i can't recommend the game to anyone that feels the competetive edge. What a waste. TL;DR: This game is amazing. But once you start getting good, you're gonna discovered how absolutely BS the ranking system is and you'll probably lose interest in the game. Pure frustration.
7902	0	a	Game keeps crashing before it starts, ive tried everything
7903	0	a	First ranked match, had both my team mates quit, 3 vs 1. FIX YOUR MATCHMAKING SYSTEM!
7904	0	a	Its rubbish unless youve got good FPS otherwise theres no point in getting it

7906	0	a	♥♥♥♥
7907	0	a	Greatest sports game destroyed by AI that are programed to be anti-teammates. Bad AI is the downfall of gaming and this has the worst I have ever seen. 'teammates' are programed to score goals for the other team and to just make games feel alive. It basically becomes a 1 VS 5 when you deicover how your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ teammates ram you more than the oppenents. Cheap way to increase the mony grab by adding a single player option with garbage mechanics. Multiplayer with real players only is the only way this ghame can be fun Period.
7908	0	a	Stupid game with stupid f****** system when in other team with party somebody have friend with blue/gold star rank and only what you do in match - miss a goal! Goal after goal.. goal after goal... YEAH! GOOD F****** GAME! NICE PLAY!! F*** stupid developers of this game!!

7910	0	a	Decent game but AWFUL servers, DO NOT BUY!  I used to love this game. I'm a Level 37 Veteran and I have put money and time into this game, having bought 4 or the DLC's. The updates are good and they bring new DLC and maps pretty much every month. But now I just can't be bothered to play it. I play at 28 PING and my internet speed is above average, but I get SO MUCH rubberbanding, to the point where the game is completely unplayable. When I go to hit the ball, I teleport sideways and miss it. I will go to get a boost pill and jump forwards, completely skipping over it. At random points in matches every thing will freeze, then a second later, everything will jump forward and continue as normal.  I have searched causes for this and most say it is just server issues. FIX YOUR SERVERS PSYONIX, and thanks for ruining this game for me. If anyone knows any way of fixing this, then please tell me ASAP so I can get back to playing the game lag free.
7911	0	a	Good for 1 or 2 games but after that sooo boring, theres no will to improve like in mobas or shooters, like Smite or CSGO, game offers different cars but thats the only thing you strive for, and with a game that could have so much more to offer it really is boring
7912	0	a	I have 200 hours on record, due to multi platform release loads of people seem to have issues with lag and rubber banding that are being ignored. Ping can be in the 20/30's and the issue still occurs.
7913	0	a	If you want this game because you think there's a good community that's into sports and fair play, look a bit further, I'm sure you find something better. RL used to be fun but now it really, really, reaaaaaaaaaaaaallly isn't. Even FIFA is better at the point RL is at and that says a lot. A LOT! Also Psyconix doesn't do anything about the guys who ruin what would be a decent game! Nuff said  Forgot something for all the ones who still thinks of buying this game, buy CS:GO, better game AND community + everyone can make money, you need the same level of luck of scoring a goal in 3 sec.
7914	0	a	Please remove wasteland from the regular map rotation. It's not a regular map. It contributes to me not wanting to play this game any more.
7915	0	a	The matchmaking in this game is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. It can give me servers with 150 and less ping but it dosent. Most of the time i get servers where i have 250+ ping and opponenets have 50-4 ping. Most unfair matchmaking i have seen in multiplayer.

7921	0	a	As much fun as this game is, they really ♥♥♥♥ed up the RLCS. My team was fully registered and ready to play except for me. However, admins never responded to my request. I needed to switch from my PS to my PC account in order to play. Since they never answered, we were ineligible and therefore DQ'd. That to me is unacceptable if you say admins will respond to issues and requests. They were given WEEKS to respond, and they didn't.  Now, as far as gameplay goes, I'd rate it 8/10. There are multiple physics issues that need to be resolved. Overall it is a fun game to play with friends as well as solo
7922	0	a	I would love to reccomend this game but I can't. Unfortunately only 1 version of the game is ranked (soccer). The hockey version is not. Thus players who like to play hockey suffer endlessly due to horrible matchmaking, endlessly getting put into games already underway and hopelessly behind when you enter, and endlessly getting put back into the same game you have already left because you don't want to be forcved to staret down 1-6, 0-5, etc.  The game - IF you get to play a game from the start - is quite fun. But it isn't worth the constant frustration it gives you when all you want is to get to play a complete game and not non-stop games which are already half over and your team isalready way behind when you enter.  I have played multiple other games with Matchmaker (MM) systems. This, by far, is the worst MM I have ever seen.

7926	0	a	They RUINED THE GAME!!!  Please believe me i've 1200h in this game and the Servers are laggy as Shiat with every update and they are going the wrong way now. Enjoy the AFK Crate Farmers which ♥♥♥♥s you off all time and then they ban you for your name because they wont understand fun. But they are too dumb to ban the AFK farmers or real offending people. No they ban people playing 1200h because of his name. Nvm thats not the reason why i make this bad Review. As i said they 'just' ruined the game  DO NOT BUY IT!!!
7927	0	a	I have been a big supporter of RL since the beginning. I was first given a free copy on my PS4.. showed this to all my PC friends and in return several of us picked the game up. I have purchased all DLC bar 2 cars and the NBA flags to further support the games development. These funds were used to create content for Micro Transactions.  I'm really disappointed in Psynoix. They were doing so much right and I was happy to give them a couple of quid for the new cars and a new map or 2 always was free but now they just see $dollar$ signs now. This is always a slippery slope and soon you will be paying for the fuel in your car :(
7928	0	a	Machtmaking sucks with latest update.
7929	0	a	First off, it's telling that you can't comment in the community discussion boards. That's probably because they got tired of reading people complaining about being 'given' crates, and then having  to buy the crate for cash-money, even after you've paid for the game. This alone is pretty gross.  Or about how horrid the NPCs are, pretty much tossing the idea of a solo season out the window. On easy, they're all potato, and your own teammates will very often run the ball into your goal. Neither your teammates or your opponents will use boost, so you're going to win. On Pro, the enemy NPCs work as a hive mind, scoring mostly shots that would be impossible to time otherwise, and your own teammates remain potato, though they do gain some sense of when to block. Not that they actually do so, but they kind of hang around in front of your goal at the appropriate time, sometimes.   On multiplayer, the servers are pretty solid, and there are no magical hive-minds, but you're always at the mercy of getting That Guy on your team that doesn't seem to understand what's going on.   The game is also extremely repetitive, and although there are different car modifications, none of them affect anything. You can play and play and your car will be functionally identical to when you started.  In summary - Very fun for maybe 5-10 hours, depending on your tolerance for doing the same thing over and over. Not good for solo at all, and mediocre for multiplayer, and you're still going to get those wonderful crates that require a credit card to open.

7931	0	a	game is good dont get me wrong  only bad thing about this game is the match making system, i was a semi pro and i was put up against a master, it makes the game crap and not worth the play as u wont win. they need to fix it

7934	0	a	Its a fun game, but I have 2 MAJOR problems with this game: 1. The ranked system is broken to a point where it is unplayable. 2. Their business model blows ♥♥♥♥, don't think that just because you bought the game that you .. bought the game.
7935	0	a	this is not working for me and i want my money back  this is unacceptable i will get my money back or i will get a free working download  
7936	0	a	Easy to learn, hard to master. I give up.  Update 2016-11-08: Unplayable, lags of one to two seconds almost every minute or more often destroys the gameplay.  Except reinstalling my operating system, I tried reinstalling my nVidia drivers, steam, the game itself, checked file integrity or whatever.  Fix your game.
7937	0	a	Waste of money, I spent 20 dollars on this game and got nothin in return the gameplay and the overall multiplayer was crap. I often versed people with 5xtimes the skill and constantly was getting killed the second I spawned
7938	0	a	You need High Spec PC TO ACtually Play the aquadome Map And The Server Is Just AID   Overall FUN But Needs HIgh Internet
7939	0	a	Worst game ever. Doesn't give you skill at all. Its all a matter of luck. The accuracy of the ball is so stupidly insensitive. And makes you continously rage on the game and want to refund it. Basically you have the unaccurate ball that jumps in between players and you hit it with the car. And the ball is so stressful makes you want to hate the game.
7940	0	a	...this sucks...
7941	0	a	I admit, it was fun. But it gets boring, fast. Its too competitive, people take this game too serious and its hard to find a game where people are relaxed and playing for fun.  Not recommended based on, you cannot enjoy it anymore
7942	0	a	Developers make it very inaccessible by including ramming and exploding other players. its fun for me, but when my less experienced brother plays and everyone rams him we have to quit. So we try ranked instead, and when people ram us there we have to quit as well. And of course, quitting a ranked match bans you from matchmaking for 15 minutes. Developers are trying their very best to make this game fun for the good players and miserable for bad players. DO NOT PURCHASE unless you expect to be extremely good at the game.
7943	0	a	...this sucks...
7944	0	a	Great game, love playing it with my brother. Unfortunatly it is somewhat ruined by horrible matchmaking, terribly made hit boxes, and poor physics. It is all to often that I need to just tap the ball with the side of my car and I miss, only to find out that the side of my car went through the ball. The matchmaking leaves much to be desired and has caused many a rage quit because it seems to be backwords or not actually use game performance whatsoever, often times pairing our recently lost team with even better opponents. The ball will also never really go quite where it should and never really being consistant with it's movements. While I would love to recommend this game, I simply can't because these poorly made parts make it hard to enjoy for any extended period of time. 
7945	0	a	Used to be a go-to game for a short game break. Lately...constant lag issues and unresponsive Burst / Jump with mouse controls never seem to be resolved.

7949	0	a	This game used to be great, I had it since it first relased, but recently it started getting pretty bad. 9/10 matches I join are all mid-match, often joining the same match upwards of 7 times in a row until I find a new match. This was never a problem until recently. Will not play again until this problem is gone.
7950	0	a	game is ♥♥♥♥, hit boxes are garbage, there are terrible game mechanics, this game is a luck based game no skills are involved when you can pinch a ball on the corner and it suddenly makes it to goal, i play it still i have no idea, but this game is ♥♥♥♥ and has brought my stress level super high because of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥ mechanics. DON'T BUY THIS GAME!

7967	0	a	So I bought this game really early since I saw a bunch of people play it and it looked awesome. It turned out to be pretty fun until I started lagging like crazy, this still goes on and I haven't changed anything about my internet or my computer. Here is a video of what it is like:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sh6a7DXqDpE  The game is completely unplayable for first 2-3 mins, then it becomes perfectly fine which I find kind of wierd... Gonna not reccomend this game till its fixed for me ^_^
7968	0	a	  sucks can't be playe din mac even though it says it can be.

7970	0	a	Meh, go throw your money in a wishing well its a better investment.
7971	0	a	Awesome game, ton of fun to play. Only really major draw back for me is the fact that it will randomly place you into games that are already in the progress of being played when someone in the game leaves prematurely. I understand this being a thing, and it's sort of nice and all, but the fact that there's no way to turn this feature off, and the frequency with which I get put into games that are more than half over where my team is down 0-5 is unacceptable. As much as I enjoy getting to play a fun round of this, that seems to happen less and less often, cannot say I would recommend this game to anyone, the rare instances of enjoyment do not justify the frequent dissapointment
7972	0	a	too many hackers and the developers for rocket league dont care so if you like playing with hacker this is your game. the ball on this game is BS, when you play alot of BS with happen to you. the community is sh*t. and the ball has no real physics to it at all, it will do its own thing all the time, ohh and expect to hit the ball fowards and some how the ball will go backwards. ROCKET LEAGUE NEEDS TO BE FIXED
7973	0	a	Everyting good but this ♥♥♥♥ing tokyo map was suck  on the ranked match we can want select map pls
7974	0	a	At first glance this seems like a fun multiplayer game. Don't be fooled. The community is a bunch of tryhards, and the matchmaking is eerily similar to Dead by Daylight in the sense that new players get matched up with seasoned veterans and repeatedly violated until their will to play is no more. Rating from one to absolute dogshit? ABSOLUTE DOG ♥♥♥♥.
7975	0	a	Pro. Good game lots of hours love it 2 much fun even with the amount of noobs.  Con. Payed full price for the game + all dlcs. Now the 'Collectors editon' is cheaper..... sorry but this is a RIGHT slap in the face for people who have supported the game since release
7976	0	a	the devs need to replace the cars with people, its to confusing

7978	0	a	fun game kidding the ♥♥♥♥ blows and is based of luck and rng
7979	0	a	This game is pretty fun. I am leaving a negative review because the competitive ranking system is so astronomically broken right now. PSYONIX is too money hungry. They are turning into Valve and it is sad.  pros: -literally none  cons: -the game will pair you up with whatever is convenient, ping disregarded, rank almost completely disregarded -there is almost never a fair match. It almost always leans heavely toward one team -If you ever rankup a division and you lose one right after the division up, regardless of how many you won in a row prior to that or who you just lost against, it will always division you down.
7980	0	a	Fix your ♥♥♥♥, let us choose a ping limit so we don't have to play on your unplayable 300 ping servers. like on any other competitive games.

7991	0	a	This game is pretty fun. I am leaving a negative review because the competitive ranking system is so astronomically broken right now. PSYONIX is too money hungry. They are turning into Valve and it is sad.  pros: -literally none  cons: -the game will pair you up with whatever is convenient, ping disregarded, rank almost completely disregarded -there is almost never a fair match. It almost always leans heavely toward one team -If you ever rankup a division and you lose one right after the division up, regardless of how many you won in a row prior to that or who you just lost against, it will always division you down.

7993	0	a	wtf i buy rocket league dont play
7994	0	a	Pro. Good game lots of hours love it 2 much fun even with the amount of noobs.  Con. Payed full price for the game + all dlcs. Now the 'Collectors editon' is cheaper..... sorry but this is a RIGHT slap in the face for people who have supported the game since release
7995	0	a	I would like if it was even playable with this bad servers  Don't buy it now!
7996	0	a	Fix your ♥♥♥♥, let us choose a ping limit so we don't have to play on your unplayable 300 ping servers. like on any other competitive games.

7998	0	a	This isn't really my sort of game but I thought I'd write this review with being helpful in mind.  Pros -cars hitting a ball  cons -they have hats on
7999	0	a	its a good game but it has a some stupid faults,dirstly if you lag out of a game some geneus at phsyonics though it would be a good idea to soft ban you for match makeing, secondly if you are playing any team modes you still move down even if you team mate does nothing (i have move down a WHOLE RAnK from a afk team mate) again wonder who mad that idea thirdly even though i moved down a whole rank the people who beat me only move up one division so basicaly if you win 5 games in a row then you could lose it all (and more) from one lose because you have a stupid team mate forthly if you play 'place makeing games' there is no point, for ranked doubles i won all my games (beating riseing stars) and got put in challenger 1 after that they put nothing into consideration and have a realy great game with errors of a game that feels like alfa i love this game but for a possitive rewview you need to fix theese improvements
8000	0	a	Fix you ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥ servers rocket league Fix Like and Dislike :/
8001	0	a	Fix your ♥♥♥♥ing servers. I hate your ranking. Why i win 3 times in a row and no rank up. Why when i win 2 times after rank uo and 1 lose and de rank. Wtf is with your ranking.?!?!?!?!?!
8002	0	a	The 2v2 ranked was fun, until a freak disconnect for 1 game sent me into a ♥♥♥♥ spiral of AFK/terrible teammates. I dont get the ranked system, unless I was reported by everyone in the game, 1 disconnect should not send me into a rocket league ship of disappointment and frustration. I would literally have to play 3v1 to make my way back to challenger. My first game after my disconnect I jokingly said to myself 'i'm probably in afk leaver city now'. Wouldin't you know it the very next goal was my teammate doing a 360 super boost amazing goal on our own net, this was followed by a neverending loss spree that made my dog and girlfriend end up dead. After about 5 straight losses (by huge magins most were forfeit) the last game I was up 3-0. In my mind I'm like hey the streak is over, OOOOHHHHH BOY I was wrong. This guy afk's in our net lets them score a goal. No big deal I can hold it off, nope he leaves and i lose the game 4-3. I now know why we were up by 3 goals its because he was a leaver apparently and this is the people im matched with after literally 1 accidentall disconnect out of 30 games.    I uninstalled this game again.... maybe next season I will try again and hope to god I dont lose connection 1 out of 50 games cause thats it.

8005	0	a	this game was good how ever even tho they will denie changes have been made sinces they brough out the new season the game has become s**t, basicly heres an over view befor the update i played against the highest bot there was in the game just for a warm up and was winning 10-20 goles a game since the update i can even beat the basic novice bot im not saying im good or anything what im saying is they have made chnges to the game were the game is not what i origanly paid for, unfortunatly most people will say im just crap at the game but you dont go from good in ♥♥♥♥ over night with out some other influence i would have at first recomended this game but since the [non exxceistant] changes i highly recomend not buying this game if i could i would get a refund

8017	0	a	Game is great, it's a genius mix up that almost every guy dreamed of when he was a child. You can either play online or in local with split screen, like good old times. And you can also play with your friends at home vs players online. That's all we need.  But man, oh man, the community. It's like a cancer for the game. I stop playing it sometimes because you can't freaking handle to hear all that sh*tload of insults and trolls ANY F*CKING MATCH. You'd be super lucky to find a player with some fairplay. Almost everyone is pure evil and scum. You can report them but since I can find one of them at ANY match, I guess reports are useless and devs should make a better work with that. Game's moving a lot of money, I know, but they'd lose a lot of good players to defend the worst part of users.   For instance, there was once that a player was afk in competitive. I waited for him, even if I could have scored and won. He came back, I scored anyway later. I told him I waited. He answered 's t f u'. He later started to invite me to suck his d*ck because probably he didn't even have a girlfriend. And when he won, of course: 'ez' spammed forever.   Dear Rocket League devs, is this the kind of players you need? Because there're plenty, in any freaking match. Especially competitive. And for me, that's a reason to stop playing a game. I'm writing a negative review because it's better to show the problem under a bad light and don't leave it among positive reviews.   Also, matchmaking is really, really bad. I can't count the times I had to play vs players with far greater rank than me or my friends. Like newbies or professionist vs veterans, masters, experts... Ridiculous.  I hope you'll work hard for those problems.

8021	0	a	great game getting worse over time. they keep adding new maps that get worse and worse (weird shapes and too bright of colors to where you cant even see anything thats going on) and THEY ADD THOSE MAPS TO RANKED MATCHES. cant disselect more than 2. doesnt have an option to turn off certain songs even when the soundtrack keeps getting worse and worse with more annoying songs. ranked system is broke (win 2 games 1 div up. lose 1 game 1 div down) servers are crap and lag all the time. what are you doing phoynix?
8022	0	a	I bought this for 11.69€ from Bundle Stars, cause my friends told me this was awesome... It cost a lot for me so I hoped this was good. I regreted my purchase...  It was developed on Unreal Engine 3, which is alright. It looks good (except for the wierd fov rendering), physics are alright and so on... Fun concept, design of the cars...  Now for the problems. First off, this costs 20€. If you going to sell something like that expensive, you need content, you need replayability. All maps are the same except fom really minor changes, only one playable mode (you do have sort of campaign with SEASONS but you will beat the AI everytime). And what about the content? Do you unlock every car by leveling up (not sure why there is there a leveling system)? 'What?, No? DLC CARS? FOR 1.99€ A CAR? OR 3.99 FOR 2 CARS?' Now its NOT a pay-to-win situation because all cars have same stats. But why am I paying 20€ for locked off content, which is already in game? Do I really need to pay 64.85€ to have content? Are you serious? The basic version has barely content for 7,50€ game... If it was a free title then sure, but NEVER HAVE THIS KIND OF DLC IN A PAID GAME!  Oh and there are crates... with keys you need to buy to unlock them... like CS:GO...  Players are not worikng as a team. In a team-based game. All they want are goals, and they hate you if you take it from them.  Hate this review all you want, its not even going to lower the overall review stats anyway. People must be blind that they dont realize, they are spending alot of money by paying for these DLCs.  Conclusion? I do enjoy playing this from time to time, but I never should have bought this for 11.69€, no content... and the music is not good...
8023	0	a	This is a great game. It's a huge joy driving around and eventually learning to fly.  Having played this game for 400+ hours, this has not changed yet. I love the community, nice people everywhere (there are exceptions, it's an online game after all.   Why can't i recommend this game?   Psyonix. That's it, Psyonix, nothing more.   It started with Batman DLC false advertising, continued with an introduced crate system and ended with horribly optimized maps. You might ask yourself why i am so full of hate, it's simple.  They don't give a damn about the players anymore.    So no guys, stay away, do yourself a favor and do not get involved in this game.  
8024	0	a	I hate fun
8025	0	a	Edit: Sept 9 2016  These ♥♥♥♥ weeds just added loot crates and you have to purchase keys to open them. I love this game, but that is ♥♥♥♥ED UP Psyonix!  changed rating to thumbs down   A newbie's advice on how not to look dumb.  1) Do not blindly chase the ball. Rushing towards it at all times usually doesn't work. Try to anticipate the ball and act accordingly. Attack the ball, but DO NOT let ball cam lead you by the nose.  2) Try not to wreck your team mates. If they are clearly going for a shot, do not blindly charge the ball. Hang back a bit and see what happens. Or try to help them if it looks like the other team is going to stonewall them.  3) Don't over-reach. If it is impossible to hit the ball, don't just lunge at the ball for no reason. If anything, try to mess up your opponents as they rush the ball.  4) A slight tap can mess everybody up. It is sometimes worth changing the direction of the ball, even if it is not to your immediate advantage. Completely changing the direction of the ball can cause attacking opponents to charge out of position, leaving them ineffective for a moment. And in that moment you can score. Or gain the advantage.  This game is so deep and yet so accessible that I am pretty sure it will be a genre definer. Like football or Doom. If there are no copy cats once this game fades, I will be very surprised.

8040	0	a	WARNING:  The developers of this game accidently struck gold with rocket league, it's basically just a remake of a pervious game of theirs but with a lot of the bad parts removed.  I thought they had learned from their mistakes and made a fantastic follow-up but it turns out they did not.   If you aren't aware they just released an update adding new maps that players are forced to play. these maps are NOTHING like existing maps, not only is the field different but they use different gravity as well.   Most of the players are very upset by this and the solution is simple, a map filter. The developers are however very inexperienced and refuse to listen to their community. They say they intend for all players to have to play maps they don't find to be fun, which shows that it was an INTENTIONAL move on their part not to include these maps in the base game so as to misrepresent the type of game this was and move more units.  I used to LOVE this game but the lack of developer skill and willingness to listen to their community has ruined it.   I can not stress enough that this game will not be what you think it is, and I can not recommend it at any price.

8042	0	a	Enjoyable game, but many details make it harder and harder to keep playing.  - In half of the cases when looking for a game, you get put in matches you're losing 5-0, 3 or more consecutive times - Public matchmaking: unranked - based on how long you played (often fairly unbalanced matches), competitive - based on performance (even then, you get people trolling, slacking, failing,...) - Number of matches that are actually enjoyable reduce with time you're playing (solo play or team play). - Sometimes, the rubber banding makes it impossible to play. - Still, no changes to core, but DLC is no problem (new cars, boosts,...)

And worse yet, obviously from what i said, the matchmaking is pure ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, IF IT ACTUALLY MATCHES YOU WITH SOMEONE?

Be warned that the practice they have built in isn't a very good way to get prepared for games.   Tldr; don't buy this game unless you know what you are getting into.

8060	0	a	The hours of fun for this price is not good
8061	0	a	Great game! Lots of fun, as you can tell by my hours. But something that has made me disapointed at such a great game, that is the keys and crates system added in the new rumble DLC. There are some other things about the new DLC aswell, these things are 1) The rumble gameplay is all over the place and overhyped. 2) The preset thing is pretty bad and needs to be fixed. 3) Decals need to be less exclusive from trading in items, and from crates. Following on part 3, I always get the coolest decals from trading in my items, but never for the cars i use, like the backfire, or the Tekkius (however you spell it) Anyways, please don't ruin another great game with crappy micro transactions. I recommend if you want to get cool stuff for your cars and you have boat loads of money, don't if you're like me and think that these should be added as an unlockable and not some micro transation bs. I get that you need money, but dpn't you think you could just raise the price or something? I mean this game is still fun, but since the crates, i have been called a poor person in several games because i could not afford to spend my money on keys.

8069	0	a	This is Absolute Garbage If you don't have a controller for it, it really isn't fun. If they reccommend you to use a controller I feel they should tell you that before hand.
8070	0	a	For all but the best players in the game the standard game mode is plain randomness as the ball is so bouncy and uncontrollable that any form of coordinated gameplay is impossible. Don't get me wrong: Naturally, there are better and worse players in this game but the difference is that the worse ones make 1 good play out of 10 situations whereas the better players manage to make 4 out of 10. That still leaves most matches as horrible comedies of errors and misplays. Even worse, as the ball usually bounces way up into the air, managing boosts becomes the main focus to the detriment of most other tactical considerations. Did I mention that the community is absolutely horrible? Usually, once a team is one or two goals down then one player will simply leave the game which is easy to do because there is absolutely no penalty for leavers in normal queue in this game. This has the nasty side effect that these leavers 'enrich' the queue with games you get put into where 'your' team is down a couple of goals which is demotivating AS HELL (there is a leaver punishement in ranked matches, though).  Last but not least the devs couldn't resist the temptation to cash in on their successful game by introducing exclusive content obtainable through a real money random loot system which is the usual EA-style red flag and big warning sign that players get suckered into spending a lot of money for unwanted items in order to maybe get the things they actually want. The bottom line is: The game is frantic good fun at first until you realize that winning and losing depend on the sole abilities to control boosts and perform 'aerials'. Consequently, it's a resource-managing competitive flying simulator with horrible incentives to spend real money after purchase. If that's your game....then go ahead!
8071	0	a	The game is a lot of fun and really creative. The servers on the other hand make the game essentially unplayable. Moving the smallest distance or aiming is nearly impossible in half the games you play. When the servers are working its an awesome game, but the server problem greatly outweigh any fun.

8102	0	a	♥♥♥♥♥♥ game, devs don't care about it. I've got input lag. Built new computers, tried new mouse/keyboard/monitor, you name it, i've tried it. It's still not fixed. My game always feels heavy, and sluggish. Devs refuse to acknowledge any tweets, or videos made about this problem. I wouldn't buy it, it's addicting, but with a mix of a terrible, absolutely awful, toxic community, and devs that don't care about the game, i'd call it a skip.

8108	0	a	I have to downvote this game due to these scumbags devs name Psyonix.  They can put forth effort on a boring RC car game based on a stupid sport but not on a game that was actually fun and involving named Nosgoth.   Ah yes Nosgoth, a shadowed game in the Legacy of Kain series. A 4v4 asymmetrical game that had replayablility, gore and excitement! Alas these asshats at Psyonix phoned it in during development (I believe around 3-4 years of Alpha state that you could buy in early with multiple Founder packs 10-100+$, which upon shutting down in Beta (lasted a few months in 'open beta' they ran off with ALL THE FOUNDERS MONEY AND MICROTRANSACTION 'keys for chests'!). I do hope all those who got that game shutdown grows a very aggressive form of ♥♥♥ cancer in the middle of the night and wake up to a locked jaw and petrified tongue.   I do not, and shall never again, support Psyonix. I hope this word gets back to them. You ruined a great game to put all effort into a garbage one.
8109	0	a	Stupid game with stupids lags. Something it's impossible to play because of those lags and if you quit for it ... you're MF***** banned from the game for 15 stupids minutes. I used to loved this game but now it suck
8110	0	a	it used to be the best game I'd ever played. but if it wasn't for the lag problem on the server side it would be playable
8111	0	a	If you like playing with your friends, and exclusively your friends, then this game is for you. I say this because the developers only care about producing new content, and NOTHING about fixing bugs. The entire match system is ♥♥♥♥ing broken. I have multiple times gotten matched up with people who either is or deserve to be several ranks below me. As if that was not enough every time a new 'season' starts, all ranks get reset and you either get teamed up with or against people wastly below or above your skill level. This game is honestly one of the most popular and most broken games I own, and I own games like Dead by Daylight and WarZ, games famous for ♥♥♥♥ bugs. Honestly, save your money because it is at times broken beyond belief. If I could, I would get a refund

8145	0	a	Can not recommend this game. The game is hit or miss with players as some players are in ranks they do not belong in, whether they ranked up from friends playing with them only to be paried with these people over and over and lose 100 times in a row. Or people who just start over with their account playing in prospect when they're obviously challenger elite or higher.   As far as the game goes, there is no adjustment to the steering sensitivity... WHAT????????????????? What ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at psyonix hasn't thought of this yet. O that's right, NONE Of them. This option is still not in the game, why? It's only for the people with hardware that allows them to play at 120fps. You have to be more precise than trying to split a human hair in two. While rocketboost is on, the analog steering control is questionable. I've whiffed more than 1000 times, and yea, I'm not a master, however, the deadzone on this game is absolute junk, and unless you play fps games on the regular, you will have no way of mastering the stick, it's just that simple. This game mimics fps games need for precision. Count me out.  I will not be putting one more minute in this game.
8146	0	a	Ok so, I got to Rising Star div 2 in Solo, but I play 2 games and drop all the way to Challenger 3 div 4, why did this happen and if this is supposed to happen then I would not recommend the game. Also, when I division downed it was against an allstar who said he was div 3, and I was Rising Star div 2, how is this fair and why did a rank down.

8163	0	a	NOTE: Yes, I bought a CD Key off of ♥♥♥ for this game, No, that doesn't affect my experience, nor does it impact this review.  TL;DR: Game is fun, But it requires internet explorer just for online play. Mine doesn't work, so I made a negative review explaining why this is a major flaw in the game.  So as fun as this game is it has a lot of issues with online play. Now if you're a more casual player in this game and feel playing with bots is more your cup of tea, please click away from this review. Now as many of you are aware this game is a fun game, hell, I can't believe I'm making a negative review for this game just because of what I have to do to run it. (Basically, My steam needs to be in Offline mode. reasons being will be explained later within this review.) Anyways I love this game actually, but there is one MAJOR flaw that is forcing me to negitively review the game. That is that the online mode is really reliant on Internet explorer... Now before you click away calling me a c**t for this being the only reason that I have made a negative review for this, give me some time to explain to you how bad this is, hell, I'll give you a visualisation for it. Now I have relatively 18 hours on this game, more than   90%   of that time is from troubleshooting it and waiting 20 minutes MINIMUM just for it to launch in Online mode and even THEN I can't play online with EVERYTHING that is possible to do to get Online play working for this game. I even port forwarded my router to attempt to run the game in online mode and it still doesn't work, It even DELAYS the game launch time from what would normally be expected to be from 5 seconds to a minute. I will admit, My internet explorer does not work, however, Other game developers have made it possible to play online games such as GTA V for example without the need to use internet explorer. So what is my point in this review you may ask? Well the point is that the game is fun as hell, however, I have suffered migrains to attempt to play online multiple times, and shorten the time for it to launch in online mode. All of which HAVE failed. I understand that internet explorer is not just a web browser, but also a tool to configure your internet settings even if it is not your default web browser. But still, I am ♥♥♥♥ing livid that I cannot play online because of the fact that my internet explorer is not working and that is a major issue to me because of how I cannot play the game and enjoy it as intended by the developers because of that.

8179	0	a	I'm going to be honest. I didn't buy this game for myself, in fact my friend pretty much made me but it by making it seem good. Anyway, I eventually bought it, enjoyed it for the first 15-30 minutes, then got incredibly bored of repetitiveness. I'm not a fan of football, and throwing card in doesn't make it any better for me. I'm not saying it's a bad game, I just don't enjoy it for the fact that it's repetitive and the fact that I just don't find it fun. I'm sure people do like this gane and I can see why, but for me, this game just wasn't worht the money.
8180	0	a	I love Rocket League. It's easily my favorite game. Its qualities are endless, its formula is brilliant, its skill ceiling seemingly nonexistant and the skill floor in order to have fun very, very low.  Which is why I'm telling you to stay away. See, developer Psyonix recently decided to introduce a crate\key system modeled after CS:GO (a game that's a cesspool of twelve year old ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and russian cheaters in and of itself), a move that can only be described as making a quick buck off of underage gambling (this time on consoles too, just to lower that age range a little bit more and get us to FIFA territory! - just like that 12 year old kid who spent thousands of dollars on their dad's credit card to buy FIFA players...) To make a long story short, I want to be vocal and do not condone such behaviour, which is why I'm posting this review and hope to be one of many negative reviews once the crates come out. Please dump this terrible model, we don't need yet another game like this.  I need to update this for reasons.
8181	0	a	It's only fun when you're playing casual modes with a bunch of friends. Other than that, this is absolutely the cancer in its purest form.  NOW FEATURING: - Getting matched up with people from higher ranks on your promos to Challenger just to make sure you don't promote! - Getting matched up with people on higher levels just to make sure you get your ♥♥♥ wrecked and don't have fun on casual modes! - A community that is rumored to be friendly that unfortunately doesn't go far from being a rumor! - Having high latency for absolutely no ♥♥♥♥ing reason! ( and that leading you to lose against your opponent with 50 ping!) - Neo Tokyo A.K.A If autism was a map - Neo Tokyo A.K.A I don't think that's supposed to make your car flip - Neo Tokyo A.K.A Now I know how it feels like to get nuked!    
8182	0	a	This game used to be good, then sometime over the summer or fall of 2016 it stopped working. Now the only thing it provides me is: Cannot connect to Rocket League servers. I've gone through everything on their support website and it's no help.

8184	0	a	Another crates and keys ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  To those who says 'But it's cosmetic only' YEAH and? People like to customize their stuff too, they don't have to be penalized. You all act like customization is only a tiny part of the game and that only gameplay matters. Fine but if you claim it's a tiny part, why they are adding that crates and keys crap trend then?  Too many selfish devs and publishers claims it's to fund their tournaments, yeah right, decade ago, we could had perfectly ran tournament, with games only have LAN multiplayer and no DLC or microtransactions crap to it.     We aren't sheep.
8185	0	a	This game has many flaws:  In ranked gameplay lvl has no meaning, something that makes ranked matches totally unbalanced. It is not unormal for rookies to be matched up against veteran in ranked matches, and is something that needs to be fixed. I uninstalled this game due to its irregularities and bad ranked matchmaking system.  In the end... Gaben, plz fix
8186	0	a	Rocket league huh? Yeah the game is awesome when u first start out. Its all fun and games but when u start to get better u get anoyed wint ranking system and pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ teammates. They cant hit it, or cross it or fail at flights. U get more and more nervous as the game progresses and u just end up being mad at the game witch is esentialy just cars and balls.. If u are good u are gonna carry or get carryed. thats it.
8187	0	a	Do you recommend this game? Definitely, not.   If u like competitive games, just go away and find another one. Because, the worst ranking system is here. Let me explain myself;  -One day u r playing in rising star rank. Then close the game, open it like 15 hours later and u r in challenger 3 ??! It happens 3 times in a week. Simply ♥♥♥♥.  -The iq average of the community is not more than 75. Moreover, report system does nothing. U can find a good teammate like in 1 game out of 4.  Damned community, damned ranking system. Just go away.  edit: If ur teammates leave, u lost like 2-3 rank in one game. System sucks.
8188	0	a	It doesn't ♥♥♥♥ing work, why am I 'not logged on'. Fix it dude.
8189	0	a	this game is great but with all this kit comes a price wich is a non friendly community and a lot of lags in compative plays that can make you rage quit the hell out and non of this adress in any way cus thay make money and make more and more stuff you need to buy but no one care about the core game in here and thats sad cus its got a potential..  over all 5/10 just cus the community that is toxic and nothing that can help with that not a report nothing at all
8190	0	a	Its super fun at first, and learning to play is cool, getting your first goals, but quickly i rank up and now am being matched with players who destroy me every time and its not as fun. Literally have lost the last 16 out of 20 games. It's not fun being matched with players who are significantly better than you. And the trolls have arrived too. Fun game, but im quickly starting to hate it

8202	0	a	THE RANKING SYSTEM IN THIS GAME IS SOOOOOOO BAD. WIN 5 IN A ROW, NO DIVISION UP, LOSE 2 IN A ROW, 2 DIVISION DOWNS
8203	0	a	Great game, but the added microtransactions are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t
8204	0	a	My answer can't be just plain YES/NO, I put No because it leans towards it. Don't get me wrong, it's a lot of fun but that fun is often killed with minor stuff.  My first problem is that I often see someone hit a ball deflects it in other direction and after a split second it resets and follows the previous path. This is enough to confuse you and miss the otherwise easy ball. This happens once or twice in every to games to me.  Second problem I'm having is ranks in matchmaking. Just to set things straight, I'm playing ranked 2v2 with my friend, both same rank and division and both pretty much the same level.  BEFORE last update which introduced crates we were constantly getting opponents whos combined rank was 2-3 ranks above ours which was sometimes a problem.  NOW I don't have this problem, but last few games I had opponents that had below 15 hours, had Semi-Pro level and were solid 3 ranks above us which played a lot better than us. I'm not saying I'm perfect, in fact I'm not even good, but playing against these is like playing against blue ranks (which is admirable).  Plus a minor annoyance which is not being able to select which maps you can play because some people don't like Neo Tokyo map. The traction on some surfaces is very odd and feels like the walls on every map have some special coding just to hold the car on it. It seems as if the bumps are slippery and your car doesn't grip.

8210	0	a	-- EDIT -- From research, 9/10 people hate the new map, and i also do. For this reason, the game developers should make it optional whether to or not have the pile of trash known as neo tokyo as a playable map --  This game's matchmaking is absolutely awful. So until it is fixed i advise not playing. In competitive of any game you are ranked with people around the same level and so therefore it an even game. This game on the other hand pairs you with professionals even though you are a starter to the game. Non competitive isn't better either. Matching you with anyone in the whole game isn't a good game so please don't buy until the developers fix this problem. I will be trying to get a refund and hopefully will succeed. Ignore the low price tag it's because you're buying a terrible game.  People who say 'A new season has just started' this opinion is not validated. The reason being if unfair matches were due to great players being unranked then this is fine, but putting prospect I against prospect V is not fair regardless.  One final comment is how pointless the new update is. In my opinion (and many others) the new tokyo map is appauling and takes all the fun out the game.  EDIT 1: The game gets worse. I have really tried to enjoy this game, and it is too late for a refund now so PLEASE do not buy this game. As of a patch yesterday it has caused NOTHING BUT TROUBLE. 23ms ping = 10,0000ms ping apparently. F**K this game seriously. The devs are breaking it and not even trying to put it right.   Put your money somewhere else as this game just keeps getting worse!  So what do the devs need to do to fix this?  - Sort out the in-game matchmaking (even an option to take longer to search for a fairer game). - Build maps the overall community enjoys. - Add search for new match in the non competitive gamemode (at the moment if you are in a party you can only vote for a rematch without leaving the game)  If the above happens (particularly the matchmaking side) then the game would be absolutely brilliant. At the moment it is a DayZ Standalone. Great idea with a poor presentation.
8211	0	a	Cars were not destined for Footy.  My reasons for this are simple. The games controls aren't bad, they're bad for a Football game. Its an interesting, creative concept, I'll give you that, but trying to make a functional football video game with the controls of driving games arent good. Chasing the ball around is very fustrating, and it happens every match! All the players are throwing themselves around like lunaticks!   Rocket League would've worked as a racing game. Or anything but a sports game! Fix up the controls a bit and try again, Physonicx. Long story short, its a fustrating, annoying game.
8212	0	a	♥♥♥♥ this game. It has ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t RNG that doesn't even make sense. Most people just hit the ball randomly and it somehow goes in. Also, who the ♥♥♥♥ designed the physics for it?

8216	0	a	Logged into Rocket League for the first time in a few months, I joined 5 quick play games. These were honestly my placements:  1) Game with 30 seconds remaining, my team already losing 3-0 2) Game with 10 seconds remaining, my team winning 4-1 3) Game with 1 minute remaining, my team already losing 7-1. Instantly left. 4) New game, one player afk, the other trying to score own goals. Reported and left. 5) New game, we score a goal in the first minute, all opponents instantly leave.  Maybe when I log in again in a few months time I'll actually get to play 1 whole game of Rocket League. Atrocious matchmaking engine. 
8217	0	a	People with small ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ usually win private matches @cobyandliam #SpookSquad
8218	0	a	Too much ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t to enjoy casually, not enough fun to take seriously. You'll just deal with fustrating luck and random bounces unless you put the time needed to get really good at it. But the game isn't fun enough to make you want to put any more time into it then you have to. One of the worst communities I've ever seen, too smug to give any useful advice. Might be worth it as a free to play game, not worth the $20 they want though. There are way better ways to spend that money on steam.

8252	0	a	The matchmaking in this game is terrible, along with 0 rewards to keep playing the game. There is no reward for playing this game except getting the duplicate cosmetics Flags,Hats etc. So you won 5 games in a row, a sane person would expect he would get something from it , but noo in Rocket League you get nothing. In game ranks are useless since you are mostly stuck in same division or you are loosing divisions due to your teammate being semi-pro while you are an expert. In game stats are poor, and only show shots,goals,saves. Slacking devs only make new DLCs to earn money rather than improving the gameplay. This game was fun for couple of days, and now it's just a slow grind to improve your divison so you can get nothing out of it. Don't play this game if you think you will get something out of it for the time invested. Do not recommened until they fix their reward system. Too frustrating, lots of 'teammates' who will on purpose play against you if you say something 'negative' to them. Good game to waste your time and nerves.  Frequent disconnects, LONGER queues after Xbox cross play(you would think it would lower queue times). Server Lags and Toxic kids are in everyday play. Psyonix bragging they are giving away FREE updates. Well updates should be free since I paid 20€ for the game!! Psyhics sometimes are not logical and needs improvements. Overall I give this game 5/10 , lots of improvements to be made but currently Devs only care to make money out of DLCs. Shame.

8257	0	a	No. If you are looking for casual fun, no at least.  Matchmaking is terrible, you will be matched by veterans by the time you install the game so get ready for a beating. And the controls are NOT easy like everone in the comments with 500 ♥♥♥♥ing hours in the game says. It's absolutely terrible and you won't be able to make your car do stuff you want before training for 5 hours first at least. If you are looking for a skill-based annoyingly hard game where you need to train for hours before you can beat noobs and enjoy yourself, maybe like dota in a way, this may be for you.

8264	0	a	Game is great fun, but broken in allot of ways, one of the most annoying is when you are playing ranked, and the server goes down and u lose connection and when u try to reconnect u get an error, and because of that you are banned for 15min that is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.  THen we have the new update rumble.. its a great mode but SOOOOO BROKENNN it counts the wrong person for scoring if they are using a freeze ray when u hit the ball inside .. or when they freeze ur scoring ball inside the goal so its their goal... AND !!! those annoying OP SPIKES even when its you who scores it feels too OP and should not be in the game. Rumble is fun but super broken.
8265	0	a	i pay 20$ for this game why i can't play it. the game blocked in my country *Iran and i can't even join any match. i hope that some day i can play this easily in my lovely country( islamic republic of Iran)
8266	0	a	I love the game the gameplay great, but if you do not have a great wireless adapter you are screwed because decent internet is horrible internet and great internet is decent.
8267	0	a	I've played this game when it was on alpha. After its release it just 'got removed' from my library, I guess the devs are expecting me to buy it again?  It's not that bad of a game, but you can't control the camera with your mouse, which is awful.  Please note my review is biased by how this company (Psyonix) killed Nosgoth just because this game had a higher playerbase.
8268	0	a	(error code 51) how to solve this?

8273	0	a	  Right. Let me summarize Rocket League.  You know those weird 'Soccer Celebration' thingos that games like World of Tanks, I think War Thunder... or, Overwatch's LucioBall(™). Yeah, Rocket League is that.  Except... you have to PAY MONEY for it.  The matchmaking is awful, I keep getting lumped in with idiots or laggers who for some reason have over 300 ping when everyone else is below 50, I keep getting thrown in with people who are just BETTER PLAYERS than me, and judging from how frikkin fast the matchmaker is, it's not very accurate. Not accurate whatsoever. I would rather sit around waiting for a good matchmaker to make me a match instead of just being thrown into a game fast as possible.  The gameplay is pretty much WYSIWYG, you drive around, sometimes fly around, and hit balls until they cross the invisible line that causes them to EXPLODE. Sometimes cars explode - I really have no idea why. Personally, I preferred the slightly more methodical nature of World of Tank's 3v3 soccer. More tactical. Yeah, sure, upper tier players are crazy gods who can judge distances and angles and stuff, great, good for them. But largely, this game will just devolve into driving into the ball and sometimes using the jump/double jump to knock it somewhere.  If you are gonna play this solo, prepare for misery!  If you have friends, hey, you might have fun.  inb4 'boohoo why you don't like muh favrite game'

8279	0	a	bought game, had some fun, then suddenly couldn't play online anymore  10/10
8280	0	a	A bad community makes for a bad game. The developers do a great job with there content (for the most part) so I enjoy playing, but the constant smack-talk and smurf-players just brings the game down in my oppinion. Fun with friends, terrible alone.  Side Rant: I have never played with this many bigoted, egotistical, ♥♥♥♥-for-brains in any other community. I have grown so tired of the constant harassment when playing that I might never play this game again. Which honestly sucks since it's such a fun game! In my own experience I have never played a match where I have won against someone who is ♥♥♥♥-talking. Even if that person is a rookie who only just got the game. I understand the hate I will recieve for complaining about something as minor as ♥♥♥♥-talk, but when you can't enjoy a match because some semi-pro leveled 12 year old, who won't quit with the smack talk, is winning because of his master leveled friend, the game goes from being a fun game, to being a frustrating experience that only results in my friends and I hating it more and more.
8281	0	a	  Why are u so ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and looking at the negative part. This ♥♥♥♥ing game is ♥♥♥♥ing great for ♥♥♥♥ sake. Just buy it!  (I never swear for ♥♥♥♥ sake)

8289	0	a	- Outstanding game - Very Addictive. Like seriously - Variety of play styles  BUT!  All of this is entirely ruined by the game's TERRIBLE SERVERS. I now flat out avoid this game in the evenings or other peak times because the jumpy lag makes the game unplayable. Also this past weekend has been especially bad because they decided to make it free to play so the game was even more jumpy and laggy.   it's great that they're coming out with awesome free DLC, but first please FIX THE TERRIBLE SERVERS!!
8290	0	a	I'm Iranian. The servers are banned in Iran and other countries like China, Syria, Crimea, etc. and I didn't know that. It seems that it's highly unlikely that developers change their ISP and for this kind of behavior I don't recommend this game.
8291	0	a	There's a lot of fun things you can do when the network/other players aren't lagging. The majority of the time though, people skip, hit boxes warp off the cars and balls bounce off of mid air, half the time you go right through the ball like you don't even have a hit box.  This game has a lot of potential if they can get physics and lag under control. I wouldn't recommend it if you want consistent competition. It's fun to dlck around with for a few hours.
8292	0	a	Apart from the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ controls, it's a pretty good game.  No free-camera on a PC game with cars? Really? Nope, not recommended until it gets this option.
8293	0	a	well done you won a match have this box but oh yeah you have to pay to open it...........X0
8294	0	a	This game is absolutely amazing..... however dont buy this unless you have a group of friends that will play with you consistently because this community is the biggest piece of ♥♥♥♥ i have ever seen. i rarely get a game with someone who is nice and everyone will chirp you over the smallest mistake even though they will make the same ones... didnt know that everyone on here was a pro....
8295	0	a	Just terrible. The controls are bad. It is SUPER LAGGY, and there is never fair teams. I bought the game and it was a waste of 20 bucks. For your own good don't buy the game.
8296	0	a	BALL PHYSICS SUCK ♥♥♥♥ DEVELOPERS NEED TO SPENT MORE MONEY ON IT -100/10
8297	0	a	This game use to be good but now its just TRASH 90% of your teammates in ranked are either boosted or had there account paid to be boosted in rank so there four your at a disavantage basically playing in a 2v1 then they get salty at you for doing all the work there for your still losing and being deranked i have lost 4 ranks in a row back down to challanger 2 because of this i have no reason to recommend this game to anyone so they can have the same treatment as me game is trash the community is trash if there not spamming what a save when they miss the ball there trash talking you for missing an aerial that they could never do game is complete garbage with call of duty community i feel sorry for anyone who buys this game now
8298	0	a	the online ranking system doesn't make much sense. in one categorey i'm ranked as a gold star, the next i'm ranked the absolute lowest ranking available. also, rubberbanding is out of control lately. i'd love to say maybe its my pc, but every other game i own runs flawlessly with rocket league as the one exception. i know DLC is good for the company, but why do i not get all the cars when i buy on pc, but xbox users do? and i also don't like that there is no way to open the boxes that you earn, unless you purchase a key... but i've already purchased the game, as well as multiple DLC packs, so i don't want to buy a key to open a box full of stuff that someone else got for free just because they play on a different system as me. the idea behind the game was pretty great, but as this game has grown, it has become very frustrating as well. if you want a soccer game, go fifa. if you want soccer with rocket cars, this is the only option for you, but be warned, if you buy on pc you only get about half the availble cars, and try not to lose your temper when you lose your first game to rubberbanding.
8299	0	a	It is fun. It is impossible to solo que though. Everytime i get stuck with the most autistic and just horrible teammates. If you want a game to play by yourself this isnt for you. You need to que becuase the people solo queing are legit 90% of the time autism in a nutshell. I try to rank up but it takes so long since have the time Im having to regain my ELO from all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ 'playing' on my team. So if you ever want to play rank I dont recommend doing it by yourself unless you do solo duels. Anyone that isnt a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ want to que hmu becuase Im done untill someone that dosent have autism decides to solo que. In other words Im never playing again.
8300	0	a	I've decided to re-write my review so it's not as harsh. Rocket League hands down was my favorite sport/skill based online game ever made. I used to play competitive online games in past like counter-strike, call of duty, battlefield, and much more. I slowly stopped however as communities in these games got more and more 'toxic'. Over time i also had less energy to play games after getting home from my job and i just didn't feel like keeping up with drama of clans/guilds in online games. I eventually gave up and for many years i stuck to single player games. Then rocket league came along, finally a very fun and challenging game that has many aspects of things to learn to keep getting better. It combines skill of precisley driving a car in driving games with teamwork in games like hockey or socker then skill of reading angles and bank shots and so on like a game of billards/pool, then you start getting into aerial shots and more and you start doing things you thought previously do be impossible. I got all way to superstar just before champion before i finally had to call it quits.  Reason? Community. Worst community i have played in any game to date. I knnow i quit online games years ago due to massive direspect other people started to have for others in online games, but i never imagined it would get as bad as it is today, with 0 moderation anymore. After argueing for past year with forum users and so on i have now come to realize that it's completely acceptable aparently in games like these to use racists attacks in a regular basis, to throw out death threats on a regular basis, to throw matches, play for other team, telll teamates off anytime your down 1 goal or teamate makes 1 single mistake. I've argued that Pysonix needs to do something about this and quickly, months go by and Pysonix starts talking about a report system, then report system gets implemented but they explain it's alpha and it's just to start logging things and test things, then months and months go by with no updates, no one every getteing banned, now over a year later and community is worst it has ever been, it gets worst higher your rank gets and the more competitive your games, and no every day you will see people verbally attacking teamates in the absolute worst way imaginahble, threats, racism, and every name under the sun. I've sent reports to steam and Pysonix, i've sent them emails, i've reported in-game. I've seen same people continue to taunt people to report them while calling them racist names for months without getting banned. It's gone way to far and i've finally quit Rocket League.  The next biggest issue with Rocket League is that Pysonix has provided 0 support. Since day 1 i've been unable to access my Pysonix forum account. I've sent them tickets on their support page at Pysonix and never got a response, months later i put new tickets, not get any response, months later add new tickets again. I've tried emailing them at email they provide on steams support page which is the rlsupport at Pysonix dot com email. it hasn't worked since day 1 you get instant notification that your not authorized to email. If you reset your password on their forums it tells you your not authorized, there is no way to reset your password. I made many many posts about this in steam forums, in discord, etc. not once has anyone from Pysonix contacted me to help. I've asked moderators for contact info for Pysonix to get help, email, phone number, anything. moderators would tell me they have no idea how to contact anyone at Pysonix other then support tickets which don't work.   So this is it. Pysonix managed to make the most enjoyable almost perfect new action sport game i have every played then completely ruined the game but providing 0 moderating and 0 support.  For those who have friends to play with, or those who only play in 3rd party moderated games and tournaments this game is still a blast. But those like me who just want to play with randoms, who don't want the drama of joining a team or making 'friends' will only find frusteration since Pysonix doesn't care about dealing with toxicity. And it blows my mind that they don't at very least care about the massive amount of racism in their game now. I'm sorry but i'm from 90's when online game services did not tolerate toxic behavior, and certainly banned any form of racism permenently and instantly with no exceptions. Yet today it's perfectly acceptable to be a racist and attack other races. I have no hope for the future of humanity on this planet now, plain and simple, we are going backwards just when i thought there was no need for racism anymore and it didn't hardly exist now i realize that most people in this word are still racists, i'd dare to say over 50% so it seems game companies don't bother do do anything about it anymore.   I've deleted rocket league from my steam account. I will no longer suppport them. i will ensure everyone i know also doesn't get this game. If they provided support and at least helped me reset my forum password i wouldn't have written this review, but they have not made any attempt to assist me in over a year, even if they decided to start providing support now, it's too late. Community is ruined for good.
8301	0	a	dum whin you get it for free you have to buy it when it gos off sale stubed
8302	0	a	Might be a good game. (If only i could connect to the servers).. 'Not logged into Rocket League Servers' iv'e tried countless troubleshooting guides... nothing. Their support team is awful, dosen't help with a damn thing.  
8303	0	a	I liked the game more than I thought I would. It's a fun, fast paced game. However the rounds become quite repetitive and it's more of a slot machine feel with most of the action.
8304	0	a	Not sure why this game gets so much praise. Sure, it was fun and refreshing at one point, but than the masses came and as with most other games, the community became toxic.   If you are not constantly playing with friends, than it is just not fun. Teammates telling others to kill themself if they miss a block or shot, spamming commands constantly, and the general 'git gud' mentality of all the players. You can shut all communication off, but doing so there goes all the teamwork and the point of the game.  Matchmaking is horrid. In my experience, 95% of the time I get placed against premade groups who are all Legends or above (~750+ hours in the game). People say rank doesn't matter, but if someone on average has 5x your amount of time spent in a game that is skill based, chances are they will outscore you. At the same time, my team will be filled with random Pros, Veterans and Rookies which are considerably less experienced and mostly just chase the ball.  DLCs, woohooooo. All of the DLCs now cost more than the game itself. Other games get trashed for providing actual new content, but Rocket League gets praised for licensing a new product and/or slapping up a new paint job. There have been free patches that will add a map here and there, but that is only every few months.  You will probably get your moneys worth out of it, but once you experience a few close calls or game winning moments, all the shine gets diverted to tedious, repetitive gameplay and babysitting.
8305	0	a	One of the worst games, I´ve ever played. Really bad physics engine, unbalanced teams and enemys, saltier community than in CS:GO, bad season and ranking system and the worst and most useless DLCs ever. I would not recommend to buy this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t game.
8306	0	a	Game 1 :  Me Beginner Beginner  VS  Pro Pro Pro  Who doesn't love the fact that lv 1 can come in your ranked team..?  Game 2 : Afk  Afk  Me  VS  player player player  *DEMOTED*  Don't buy this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game it's LoL with a different concept, but all the same in terms of teamplay, it's ♥♥♥♥ 
8307	0	a	Should never have been released with theses bugs and crashes on Linux.

8312	0	a	'Nice shot!' 'Thanks!' 'Wow!' 'OMG!'   if you get annoyed easily by arrogant ♥♥♥♥♥ beating you in a 1v1 8-1 then please dont buy this game..
8313	0	a	Added a predatory gambling system to the game.
8314	0	a	Started off liking this, fun and an interesting way of football, however after a few days it all gets too repetetive, kick offs are just ridiculous and half the goals will come from freak accidental hits on the ball and this is where the game fails for me, don't believe those who say this is a game of pure skill, there is some skill involved but the game is too much of a random will it won't it go in for my liking. Your car will end up flying around without you being able to control it and the ball will be rolling towards your goal for an easy tap in. had the game a week and i'm totally ored with it, only cost me 11 euros so can't grumble, overall fun to start with but the repetition and freak goals will just frustrate you as you try to learn how to play. Before i get flamd, I am not an uber gamer and not just salty because I am not that good at this, but all players of this will agree that this is a game is fun but the fun wears thin as you lose to goals from the kick off when you both hit the ball at the same time but somehow the ball goes towards your goal with you either upside down or skidding without any chnce to get back and defend the inevitable tap in, this happens time after time in solo play and is just ridiculous, why doesn't the ball get dropped at kick off? It would at least make it a bit more skillful to boost to the ball rather than just crash into the ball at the centre and so many stupid tap in goals happen? out of 5 I'd give this a 2, fun to start with but soon becomes very dull.
8315	0	a	  The game is totaly broken, no mechanics, the hit box off the cars and ball is messed up. and the ball is flying randomly around.
8316	0	a	I can not reccomend this game in its current state. The 'skill matchmaking' is absolutely horrible, 95% of the time I'm matched against someone 2 - 3 ranks higher than me and I get someone 2 - 3 ranks below me. There is no AFK timer or if there is it's extremely long I'm constantly getting matched with or against AFKs and it's not fun for either side. Joining losing games, it's just horrible absolutely horrible. Getting put into the game with 30 seconds left and the enemy team up by 5 or 6 goals is extremely frustating, since there is nothing you can do but take the loss. But worst of all THERE IS SO QUIT PENALTY I cant even begin to tell you how many games I join, the enemy team gets a 1 point lead and my teammate quits and I'm left with an AI. I love Rocket League it's an amazing game but it's currently hell to play. Thankfully it's very easy to fix these issues and I sincerely hope they do!
8317	0	a	Everyone seems to love this game, but honestly, it's repetitive, uncreative and boring. There are no stats, skills, or any changes, other than the number of players--forever. It doesn't matter which wheels/car/body/whatever you choose because it's pointlessy cosmetic. You know exactly what to expect every game. The only differences are camera angle, ping, and luck. There are no rewards, or sense of accomplishment.

8336	0	a	The game is a lot of fun. But there are two negative aspects. First the matchmaking. It happens way too often that I get matched with players far out of my league. Second, the 'lab' maps are in the standard rotation now. That makes it annoying to find a game without quiting to the main menu every other game to change the map.

8342	0	a	I truly don't understand the hype of this game. You drive a toy car around a small arena and hope you hit a ball in vaguely the correct direction. The car doesn't even have breaks - you have to mash the reverse button, which is highly ineffective for stopping your car. And 90% of every match the ball is bounced around one of the 4 corners while everyone madly tries to swat it out of the air at random.  If I had not gotten this in a bundle I would have returned it for my money back. I can't recommend unless you just like being part of the sheeple hype-train.
8343	0	a	This game for me isnt fun. I put 3 hours into the game giving it a chance and when i tried to refund it, it has a 2 hour policy which is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. I wated 21$ canadian on this game.

Cons:  -Sometimes when in singleplayer or multiplayer the game really stars lagging which is a pain in the ♥♥♥ like when you gonna score a goal.  -There is no season multiplayer which is why i have only 2.2 hours in the game.

8366	0	a	I honestly can't recommend this game. It's supremely addicting, but is one of the worst games at making you play like you're on autopilot.  Has no real sense of progression, I admire the vast customizing options, but here it feels really anticlimatic and undeserved in general. If you guys enjoy good gameplay and don't care about much else, then be my guest. But in the long run, I dropped this game and never returned to it because all in all it felt really unrewarding, and got stale quick.
8367	0	a	I thorougly enjoyed this game for the past couple of months until the latest update when the aquadome was added. With every other map except aquadome my comp runs great but on this map I have extreme lag. I changed all setting in the game to high performance, I changed setting on my comp to run games better, and I still get extreme lag on this map to the point where I cant even play. I payed 15 dollars for a game and now I cant even play on one of the maps i constantly get in competetive matches. Either take the map out of competitive (like you should with neotokyo) or fix your game so that when people have the settings in high performance they can actually play this map.

8379	0	a	This game is quite fun and entertaining. BUT I hate the cross platform. I know I suck,but I lost to a PS4 player 3 to 6 on 1v1. Sure maybe because I suck. But you see the ps4 controller.. all the controls are like closer and feels more like responsive as this game is like an arcade game and its just appropriate for a ps4 controller.  But if you're like me and have NO consoles at all and NO controller at all... All you have is the keyboard which feels meh.   I mean maybe I lost because I suck. But to make me comparable.. Why not make PC vs PC and PS4 vs PS4.. besides PS4 has already lots of ♥♥♥♥ing exclusives like Gran Turismo and Uncharted series which we dont have.  Those PS4 suckers can suck their own ♥♥♥♥ while the pc masterace suck their own pc   ok nvm  i just hate consoles they are ♥♥♥♥  ps4 is ok tho xbox is gay  dont kill me pls   steam machine is also gay

8415	0	a	This game is pure Shitake,,,,f!@CK Steam!
8416	0	a	This is an entertaining and fun game for people who are naturally 'gifted' at video games in the talent or skill accrual departments. I, most certainly, am -not-. The music in this game is nice, the premise of the game is great, and it's attractive and colorful, but the problem with multiplayer games if you just aren't good or able to 'git gud' as they say, is that you're just screwed and going to exist as a stepping stone for the success of your opponents and a pebble in the shoe of your more skilled team mates, annoying them that you're slowing them down.  If you aren't talented or able to get good hastily, this game will wound your pride while inspiring rage and envy in you by the bucketload as you watch other players perfectly rocket up off of the field to hit the ball into the goal from above while you try and fail HUNDREDS of times to do the same. It took me about 36 hours to pull that off once, and I did it by accident when I succeeded; not one I could repeat either, mind you. Unless you're naturally good at games or just want to be filled with negative emotions and 50 CCs of butt-hurt, then I would highly urge you to avoid this game or only watch other people play it online if it interests you that much.
8417	0	a	Haven't gotten any Items in over a month. and i get banned after EVERY ranked game i play for 15 minutes. add that to the post game wait and waiting for matchmaking I have to wait 30 minutes between each match. ♥♥♥♥ this game.  Fix your ♥♥♥♥.
8418	0	a	The matchmaking is wank. I'm rubbish, and keep getting matched with guys that have hundred of hours. Don't buy this unless you're going to play offline or are prepared to practice a lot of hours to get good.   Forget playing for fun, players are toxic and will leave mid-game if your team is not doing well.  The game itself runs well and looks good, except for crashing issues on Linux when trying to load certain maps. That's highly annoying.
8419	0	a	Huge rubber banding issues even on very low ping causing the game to be unplayable. Basically impossible to move around the field and when you think you have hit the ball it teleports across the otherside of the map. The devs have known that this is an issue for almost a year now and no action has been taken to try and smooth out these issues. Avoid until fixed!! (whenever that is going to be)
8420	0	a	start off, i have put lot of time in to this game, it was fun, quick, and easy to get the hang of. Now it does nothing but studder... internet issues, hmm ok, my connection is solid 150 Mb's down, my ping was 20 something the first year or so, now it is 50 something, i havent moved, my internet hasn't changed at all.. my pc is more than capable to handle this game. Why is it studdering? now to top it off im actually losing connection and timing out in the middle of ranked matches (all the while my internet is still rock solid) which results in me getting the 15 minute ban because i left the match.... I didnt leave the match, your servers suck and you ban me.. instead of new content (decals, rocket trails, toppers, wheels, or whatever else) fix/upgrade/get more servers to handle the player base you have.
8421	0	a	The only game my friends and I get lag in. You'll be just about to hit the ball and then suddenly your on the opposite side of the ♥♥♥♥ing field. Fix your net code Psyonix.

They recently implemented the ability to vote against maps you do not like and do not want to play on... especially in competitive. Even though i have the maps disliked and do not want to play on them i continually get stuck playing on them. The new maps that change the way you play in the normal style arena are terrible. Yet for some reason they keep making these trash maps and forcing them on me. Make me wait longer in queue STOP PUTTING ME ON THESE ♥♥♥♥ MAPS! Also matchmaking is broken to often, when it says finding player have it find a player instead of failing to start match and starting the process all over again.  Game can be loads of fun when you have good teammates and are playing on maps you want to be playing on.

8424	0	a	fun for a while, but then you dont really want to play if anymore.
8425	0	a	Partied with my friends as new players but we keep getting put up against 200 ping players who have mastered this game and trashtalk newbies. Gameplay is clean and simple, but matchmaking is broken. Frustrating and will not buy this game.
8426	0	a	Unless you have a dedicated group to play with, it's absolutely pointless to buy this game. The randoms are absolutely worthless but think they're gods of Rocket League, but that could just be from the free weekend. Your own team will ♥♥♥♥ you over more than the enemy team. 1v1 mode is equally worthless, because the slightest little thing can fling the ball across the map and into your goal without any chance to recover. The ball physics seemed to act up more in 1v1, but maybe it was lag or something.   The matchmaking was also a pain in the ♥♥♥. It would constantly throw me into matches on a team that was losing 3+ to 0 and with like 10 seconds left. Plus in the 3v3 and 4v4 matches, I was finding that there was almost always a person just flying around and ramming people to death, which would cause a chain reaction and then it just became ramming simulator 2016.  Besides the horrible randoms and bad matchmaking, there's not a whole lot of terrible stuff. The physics can be really dumb sometimes, but great at others. I was completely unable to get used to the camera. The ball camera negatively affects your manuevers, but the other mode makes it hard to follow the ball. I tried switching between the two, but to try to do that while trying to actually play the game was hopeless.
8427	0	a	Rocket League is a physics-based sports game loosely based on soccer. You play as a rocket-powered car, and your goal is to bounce an oversized ball off of your vehicle into the goal on the other end of the field. The standard setup is 3v3, but you can play with teams of any size from 1 to 4.  The game is very simplistic. The controls are fairly basic, but are at times frustrating. Your car can drive forward or in reverse, skid to help you rapidly change direction, give you a rocket boost, or jump (and double jump). The jumping is the most complicated part of the game; if you jump and use your rocket boost, you can fly through the air for brief periods of time. You can also shoot through the air with a sort of rolling rocket boost instead of jumping/double jumping, which takes your car on a much lower arc.  The controls are tight in their own way, but also frustrating; there are very few commands, but the jump and the “throw your car through the air commands use the same button ,with the only difference being directional controls. This is a bit frustrating at times, as you want to double jump or boost and get the other thing. It is something you have to get used to, but it feels strange that you have to at all, because there are so few buttons actually being used.  Likewise, flying through the air on a rocket is extremely awkwardly executed. It takes a lot of practice to do so reliably, and the controls are very sensitive, making it easy to spin out or end up somewhere you didn’t want to go.  The overall physics of it are decent enough; it is generally fairly predictable where the ball will go, but oftentimes, multiple cars will collide with the ball at the same time, making its trajectory much less predictable.  There is both a single player mode and a multiplayer mode to the game; the single player mode takes the player through a season of games with NPC teammates, while the online multiplayer mode has both ranked and unranked modes at multiple team sizes. The ranking system works pretty well, and I was mostly being matched up with reasonably skilled players close to my own level, though it seemed to overestimate my skill rather than underestimate it, so I was usually one of the weaker players; I did not once win the MVP award when I played online.  The games are also quite short, clocking in at five minutes each, though the replays on all the goals make them last longer, especially in single player, where sometimes the weaker AI levels will allow you to rack up 20+ points in a game.  All in all, the game is a decent sports game, albeit with somewhat questionable controls.  So why the lack of a recommendation?  Honestly, while the game was fun for a while, by the time I’d played it for a day or so I was already more or less done with it. It wasn’t that it was bad, it was that, like many such games, it was pretty repetitive. But the game itself felt very simplistic.  If you aren’t a sports game fan, you’re likely to get bored with this game fairly quickly. If you don’t have a high tolerance for repetition, you also won’t really care for this game very much.  If you do like the sort of repetitive, iterative competition, and don’t mind a bit of chaos in a game, this may well be something you enjoy. But personally, I got all that I wanted to out of the free weekend, and I can’t really see wanting to buy it to play it more.
8428	0	a	Makes me toxic.
8429	0	a	Be ready to loose your ♥♥♥♥ because this game is a definition of cancer.  Im geting matched against Masters or Experts and im only 'Pro' that is 20-29 level.  They will do anything just so you don't rank up. And when you rank up finally you gonna get matched with a troll in your team or a player that doesn't know how to jump and you're gonna loose your rank that you worked hard for.  Matchmaking is trash but Psyonix won't do ♥♥♥♥ about it. They are focused on money, not community.  Im just happy i bought this game from ♥♥♥ and that i didn't support developers. Because they don't deserve to be supported. That pretty much sums it up. Godbye Rocket League.
8430	0	a	Good game but Bad server :(  Fix your server plz :(
8431	0	a	Would not recommend. This game is trash. The bounces are garbage as hell and the developers suck ♥♥♥♥ at their own game. Hit boxes are trash. i am Superstar, i mean was and dropped to All star bc of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ players getting ♥♥♥♥ing lucky
8432	0	a	All i have to say is these servers are ♥♥♥♥ing awful
8433	0	a	Hello! Are you a new player that will be excited for the first week and play nothing but rocket league, then sorta turn into a casual player like me? Well if you are, WELCOME TO HELL! Being Mtached up with players of your 'Rank' is like a old man being matched up with 'The Rock' because they once apone a time they were both in the heavy waight championship at some point. Oh and by the way welcome to Salty times when people start losing even just a little bit people simply rage quit because that 2-0 lead you gained threw a couple lucky goals, then when your self are there to simply have fun, win some and lose some and don't leave when the score is 0-10 for the other guy, apperently to Rocket league that means that's okay because you refuse to leave simply because you're losing which equals no problems in Rocket Leagues eyes. Sigh it really frustrates me when the community it's self is just such a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.   All in all is that if your planning on being a MLG gamer and not buying this to simply play on a past time then get this. However if you aren't willing to put the rest of your life into this game then don't even bother. Once you reach your peak you're done.
8434	0	a	Have you played hearthstone, any sort of card game, or ever rolled dice in your life. Then this game will briung back memories of RNG. Think you have bad odds of getting a royasl flush, or getting that perfect draw, well it is even harder to prevent your oponents from scoring in the first 5 seconds off every kick off. your opponent will always have atleast an %80 chance of hitting it to your side off the start and a %40 chance to score. So unless you enjoy getting destroyed in every game you play then dont buy this awful game.
8435	0	a	I like the game. But, Rocket League server's are bad. This game made me mad everytime i played it because the server's are bad.
8436	0	a	A game that needs a controller to be playable needs to reconsider its control scheme. Many games have pulled off mouse control with dynamic steering and throttle, but it seems like this game is far behind others in that category.  Why make a PC game at all when you need a controller to enjoy it?
8437	0	a	Controls are crap. Too hard/stressful; not enjoyable at all, and super repetitive. Don't buy it, the hype is overrated.
8438	0	a	♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t game. ♥♥♥♥ where do i start. europe players have more chance of winning because they are the superior race, and also because they are sitting on the servers. we, the jews, have 0 chance because of the racism of the Third Reich. Dont even get me started on the physics engine, Newton would flip in his grave if he saw the physics.  In conclusion, ♥♥♥♥ game if you are from the lower race (jews, and slavs) because the ping will be double than your superior race opponent, In addition the physics are ♥♥♥♥ like the game.
8439	0	a	This game is terrible. it is so hard to play and makes no sense. total bull. i dont recommend getting this game. waste of money.
8440	0	a	I definitely would not recommend buying this game since they added in boxes that you have to buy keys for. This isn't CS:GO, this is Rocket League. Make me pay for cars, okay, don't start making me pay for boxes now. Go to hell Psyonix.

8473	0	a	Matchmaking and ranking system are in need of a major overhaul. Basically, if you don't have friends to play and chat with, expect it to be a role of the dice whether you get good teammates or not. If you can't carry crappy players, you lose. Oh, and it doesn't matter if you are amazingly good, if you'd don't win the match, you don't rank up. Makes no sense. Would not recommend until they fix this.

8476	0	a	Awesome game, but the matchmaking system is so screwed. Me and my friends (all prospect 3 semi pros or pros) are consistently matched up with challengers, whole teams of veterans and experts. I'm not sure if it's people boosting or the matchmaking system is broken. I will upload screenshots to my profile next time I get fingerbanged by a guy with 2000 hours just to prove it. Solid game though, would reccomend if it didn't make me want to snap my own neck.
8477	0	a	Good game, but the kind of player you find is crap. Lazy to learn the game and not bright enough to understand TEAMWORK. It's a me me me ball chasers delight. I've seen master and legend skill level struggle because a driving, ball hitting game must be far too difficult to learn. HAHA the matchmaker will put you in a game with 1 to 3 min. left in that match, the score will be 4-0 and you didn't spawn on the winning team. 80% of the time you will not get a full match. The crate items are lame even for $1. At least it's easier than the crane game at the local grocery store.
8478	0	a	 Note: Just ignore the many downvotes. I'm a heretic since I dare to criticize this holy peace of digital art.    I can't recommend that game at all. Rocket League turns out to be more annoying than entertaining the longer you play it. You'll have many reasons to uninstall it.    Pros:    + It's entertaining in the first hours. + Thrilling matches are possible under perfect circumstances - or with friends. + There are online modes for casual and competitive matches. + The Singleplayer Season is a nice alternative to Online-MP. + The recently added Rumble mode is awesome (if your teammates are okay).   Cons:    - The game becomes very repetitive after a while. There is hardly anything new you can do, with the exception of a match-rule editor (Mutator) that allows you to adjust the ball size and speed, boost strength and so on. But this is only available for Singleplayer matches (= with NPCs). - The matchmaking is totally broken. It's no rarity that you (as Pro) and two Rookies will compete against three Rocketeers. It's even worse in Ranked, because almost every defeat results in a downgrade of your Division (= an indicator how close you are to the next rank - from I [low] to V [high]). The game doesn't distinguish between good and bad players in a losing team, everyone will get punished equally. - In Ranked, your current division rank isn't displayed properly. It has happened to me that I start the game at Division IV, lose it and get downgraded from Division III to II. Furthermore it seems that a loss will get you downgraded faster than a win will upgrade you, wich makes it really hard to rank up. - In Singleplayer, the NPCs in your team are always terrible. They are passing to the opposing players or even shooting own goals. Usually, the opponents are equally bad, however - from time to time - they archive unbelievably awesome trickshots. That feels quite unfairly. - There is no Solo mode in multiplayer Casual, meaning that you are often forced to play against a group of players (who are usually way better since they can communicate with each other) while having complete strangers in your team. - Sometimes, the Online servers seem to be overloaded, what results in huge lag that makes MP impossible. - The community is toxic (you'll get insulted every second game, I guarantee it) and they can't accept reasonable criticism, especially in Steam reviews. - There are also minor annoyances like weak boosts or bad point allocation (for goals, assists, etc.). - Last but not least: Most matches are decided by luck. The game itself is way too chaotic to actually implement a proper strategy. Those who say it's all about skill just lie.

8501	0	a	No mouse look. Why?  Not sure how it is for others, but I got so used to having control over what I can look at (like GTA for example), for me it was really hard to position myself correctly, making the game really painful. I guess I'm a minority with this here, but it's not about how it should be played. It's about letting any of us play however the most comfortable it is.  Make mouslook available pls.

8537	0	a	The ranking system in this game is terrible. I absolutely sucks! I play with one friend and we only play together and somehow he managed to be 3 ranks infront of me. Like what the hell!!!???
8538	0	a	It was simple and fun before the inventory update happened, crate droprates are super low I made the mistake of buying 20 keys and ive only been able to unbox 3 crates in 4 weeks because these drop rates are so low.{i keep getting worthless paintable items as my weekly 3 alotted drops YES 3 its rediculous} Plus each and every car handles different and they havent announced or embraced that yet. Go play an actual racing game they are better.

8543	0	a	3/10, Poorly optimized game with broken collision models and lack of proper matchmaking.  Pros:  [+] Fun with friends to ♥♥♥♥ around on. [+] Some entertaining moments where the game ♥♥♥♥s up so horribly that the ball goes flying off an enemy car and into their own goal. [+] Simple graphics yet pretty.  Cons:  [-] Broken Matchmaking, 2 Prospect Elites went against a Challenger 2 and an Unranked multiple times. [-] Warped Car collision models. If you want an easy win play Merc, which has a 1.5x hitbox on the top allowing it to hit the ball in ways that will never touch the van. [-] Broken Ball mechanics. A car hitting the ball at low speeds will send the ball flying into the top of the arena, whilst High speed the same car will see that the ball goes flying at high speed to the top of the arena - in the opposite direction from where you hit. [-] Buy once, and then buy everything else. While this is technically only for 'Cosmetics', when each car has their own hitbox detection it can break the game watching a ball not touch the car and still recieve the hit. [-] DX9 x86 only. x64 players beware, you will experience the odd crash as a game that is 'new' was designed for an outdated system. They've also stated that they will not be inputting x64 versions, or DX11 versions into their game. While this is a UE3 error and not theirs, I feel their error was in using UE3 to begin with after UE4 had been on the market 2 years before their game was released.  Probably some more bugs that I haven't remembered yet, but in the end, it's only a game worth playing if you're an e-sport person. Like League of Legends this game is flawed with no attempts to fix it in sight. Unlike League of Legends, you have to buy this game, which makes it worse in some aspects.  Also, the Number 1 player in most of the challenge boards is called [Psyonix Fix Your Game] or something to the sort. If the #1 player is saying these things... be warned.

8547	0	a	Still waiting for the linux version which was supposed to be over 4 months ago. Was stupid and trusted the 'soon' declaration. Meanwhile all of my friends are pretty much done with it already.
8548	0	a	Can't believe I wasted my cash on this.  Last time I give into anything popular.    It is fun, but I really, really despise the teammates I am constantly put with.  Either play to win or don't play at all.
8549	0	a	The game and the concept are very cool. The matchmaker however is ABSOLUTELY atrocious. I constantly, as a new player, have to play against people who seemingly have played this game forever and get my ♥♥♥ kicked. Now I dont expect to win everything from the get-go. Do not get me wrong here, thing is however that there is a limit to how much is tolerable and that limit is very much exceeded. It is not enjoyable and because of this atrocious behavior of the match making to constantly put me up against much better players this game is not enjoyable to me. I wish the match making was better because I really want to give this game a recommendation, I can totally see how that would probably be tons of fun but that for some reason never happens.
8550	0	a	Game lags constantly, is nearly unplayable with keyboard and mouse, and has one of the worst cameras I have ever seen in a video game. Unless you have an xbox 360 controller you're completely screwed, but it won't fix the camera. After 7+ hours of this game, every match is me watching other people hit the ball and unable to do anything. If you think you can pick this up and play casually you are wrong. Don't bother purchasing unless you are ready to devote some serious hours to this game in order to even begin touching the ball. Not for casual gamers at all.

8552	0	a	Well, great game! But i have one thing to say.   After playing 1000 HOURS i get my account rank reset, what the ♥♥♥♥ is going on?
8553	0	a	game was ok but not fun for me. Not enjoyable after some time.
8554	0	a	Not Really a MOBA.
8555	0	a	Fist off my internet is awsome I play online all the time with no issue. But Rocket League has bad servers so it always laggs. The game is decent if the server is good but singleplayer is there but easy. So I barely result to singleplayer.
8556	0	a	Dumb cross-platform system, in that you cannot actually queue up with friends in a party, only play in private matches with them.
8557	0	a	Shallow gameplay and bad community.
8558	0	a	I thought the matchmaking was an april's joke but april is soon over so I'm not really sure if I can recommend it.  ...unless you like player setups with 5 semi-pro and 1 veteran, where the veteran scores all 12/12 goals with flying air 270 degree flips and turns, 90% ball possession, driving on the roof appearing out of nowehere and somehow mastered the art of jumping and flying half way across the pitch and the rest of the 5 semi-pro level players asking themselves what the heck they are doing there.  This setup happens 33.33333...% of the time, more or less.  Otherwise, great fun.  I give the game 7 out of 12 veteran versus rookie/semi-pro goals.
8559	0	a	I like this game but I can't recommend it, especially if you plan on playing the comp matchmaking. Players drop out, leading to 3v1 games at the lower skill levels, and it's impossible to get enough wins to get out of that and to a league where people care about positional play. Really unfortunate, since the other gamemodes are fun.  The game also has severe connection issues.
8560	0	a	This is a good game, however you dont need skill to win, you can be the best player in the match but they will still win because they have luck on there side, then they say it's a 'ez' game or say you are a noob because they got a fu**ing lucky goal by bouncing it of 4 walls and going in.  Then you get to the servers sometimes they are good, but at certain times of the day you get rubber banded across the map but you have good ping WTF is up with this. Then you get in a good match and the other team is two or three ranks above you, so if you are ranked as Pro you get put up with people that are expert and veteran and thats not fair and ends up getting angry at the game and rage quitting.

8564	0	a	Great game, however an update hascaused an amount of lag that makes it unplayable. I hope it gets fixed (I retry every few weeks), but its been a while
8565	0	a	I do not recommend the game at current time . Rubber banding issue for almost 2 weeks. work one hour fine and it start to lag all over again. Good game and bad servers
8566	0	a	First off this game is great dont get me wrong and you can have alot of fun with it. The real problem is the community it toxic as crap. If your not playing some try hard up tight kids spamming over the mic everytime something happens, its the trolls you get paired with that just run into you so you can do anything and if your playing ranked say goodbye to your score.
8567	0	a	  It's very hard to play, you need  a controller  just to play it, you need a computer that's basically built for the sole purpose of gaming in order to enjoy this to the fullest (because if you don't, the game lags at like 2 fps), and worst of all, it's expensive as ♥♥♥♥. I got this game as a gift for pre-ordering the Steam Link and the Steam Controller (along with Portal 2), and I'm kind of glad that I did, because this game, in my opinion, is not worth 20$ of my hard earned money. Dislike this review all you want, this is just my opinion.
8568	0	a	I love it but I can't recommend it.  If you want salt on sale, this is the game. The community is the cancer of Rocket League. Let a goal in - have a group of 10 year olds spamming 'What a save!' in chat. Miss a shot - the same group screaming 'Nice Shot!'. The salt becomes even saltier when they refuse to skip replays. I still can't understand why the hell Psyonix hasn't included the ability to remove post-goal replays from online matches.   The micro-transaction system is rubbish. I've bought around 50 keys so far, and it's just decal after decal that no-one gives a damn about. I've bought all the DLC - something recommend if you really want the advantage on the field with turning radius and hitbox advantage. Standard cars in the game are useless. Also - don't get scammed by traders.  Do not ever play 3v3 in ranked games. You will rage. Your teammates will be useless and will blame you for losing. Even if you carry the team in a loss, scoring all the goals and doing all the defending - they will find a reason to blame you. Doubles and solo are recommended.   Psyonix had potential to make this game great - but even something as small as the animation in trying to control the car or flip it after you've fallen off a wall or gone into a wall just takes too long - which opens a massive window for goal scoring.   Tired of the cancerous community online? Go play with bots. Win 10-0 in an 'unfair' game. The bots are useless - even at their strongest.   Negatives: - Bad bots - Micro-transactions - Moronic community - Salty 10 year olds - Pay-to-win DLC  Positives: - It's fun.

8587	0	a	While the game is incredibly fun. I can only recommend you buy it, if you like repetitive gameplay.  I ranked to Semi-Pro in under 2 hours, and i can safely say that most matches are allot a like. You hog the ball in the corner of the field. Sometimes it goes to the middle. You try to take a shot. And your team mate c*ck blocks you by ramming into you.   So, again. If your oke with most matches being allot a like, and some others more, fun and different. Than definitely buy it. Especially now that it's 40% off. However, if you don't. I wouldn't even recommend buying it, even if it's 50% off. There are a ton of other games out there, with much more varied gameplay then what your paying for.
8588	0	a	Don't buy it full of ♥♥♥♥♥♥s
8589	0	a	Rocket League more like requires controller league.. Wasted all the money i have been saving up for 4 months now.. i cant afford a controller so please donate one to me))))) if you can afford it  But do you know a game that doesn't require a controller? Exactly its the Wolf Among us! The best game of all time i would spend 10 times the money that i spent on this on The Wolf Among us instead   https://youtu.be/u8ckxMWfJiA?t=31s   Ez win for wolfs as usual
8590	0	a	combining 2 worst vg genres couldnt end good its total garbage matchmaking sucks, when you just start playing you're put in the same game with cucks who play this ♥♥♥♥ 30 hours a day you can play with bots but bots have autism and their only goal is to kill all humans so even allied bots will help enemy bots score goals and will keep getting in your way though you can just boost and score at the start of the round then go afk and wank or something until time runs out, very educational yes  at least customization is ok optimization is ♥♥♥♥ too

8602	0	a	The ranking system is the most broken thing I've seen since a phone that has been dropped from outerspace. I have been in prospect 3 division 5 for a total of 25 games. I have won AT LEAST 60 percent of the games. I play with a friend who is worse than me. It has been proven in other ranks and 1v1s. He is almost out of prospect elite division 5. He constantly ranks up. We play together and win, as I said, AT LEAST 60 percent of our games but he is the ♥♥♥♥ing one who ranks up. It is beyond aggrivating.
8603	0	a	It's a great game sure, but many thing will make you hate it, as for lag and servers issues. The community too is sooo bad, try 1v1 you will have at least one guy saying you suck all the game it can be quite fun =D. Play it with friends or just dont because alone it can be just sad.
8604	0	a	Not worth 20 dollars
8605	0	a	Since the latest updates the general system has been changed. Rocket League developed in many different ways including positive and negative directions. Today it is based on playing with premates to be successful in this game. I started playing at season zero and now at season 2 I can not play without premates a few rounds to keep my rank (Rising Star). I am constantly loosing because of bad matchmaking and inactive/disrespectful mates who are thinking and behaving like the last piece of beginner...  All in all it is not worth the 20 $ etc. and there is no real fun while playing ranked. Rocket League was a good game and now it is like all the other ''Community-Based-Games'' which are overcrowded with kids,noobs and flamers... There are too much ranks and the divisions ( 1to 5) which are impossible to climb up because of the written reasons. Do not buy Rocket League except u wanna join a clan etc. For ''single players'' Rocket League is not that kind of game it has always been and it would be a waste of time and money for those.

8619	0	a	I first played this game on a free weekend and fell in love with it. Then they introduced Tokyo. I started to wish they had a way to opt out of 'weird' maps...I mean thats what the Lab setting is for, right?? Latest update brings even more Lab like maps to the main stage with no way to opt out.  Honestly, with all of the new maps, crate drops, smack talking and rage quits this doesnt feel much like the game I use to enjoy. I would no longer recommend this game.
8620	0	a	This whole game in a nutshell. Some one scores goal, some one leaves game. You find a game, you replace leaver.  Are you kidding me ?  This is 2016 and its soon 2017 you can't just have games without penalties why are leavers even a problem still in this game ?

8624	0	a	I reccomend this game if your into white boy music, the gameplay is great, everything is great, except the music only targets one audience, Hopefully they out some 'ghetto' music, drake or rihanna, or add some trap music, it would make the game 10 times better to add music that targets everyone, not just white boy music (For lack of a better term) add some spanish music or cultural music, as well as 'ghetto music' (fr lack of a better term) to apeal to everyone, and give them a choice of what they want to hear. Hopefully they see this and do something about it.... Game is amazing, im just complaining about the music.
8625	0	a	This game is fun, i wont lie about that, but ranked match making is the worst match making I have ever came across. Let me give you an example. 3v3, me as semi pro and another semi pro and some beginnere in one team agains 2x pros and a beginner. Now how is that fair? Putting 2 pros vs 2 semi pros. I have played a lot of game were matchmaking were their weak side but this game just beats anything with its very ♥♥♥♥ match making. If you are looking rank up then there is the bad news for you. It will take you ages before you do.

8644	0	a	im probably the only person on steam to find a game about car futball unappealing, bought it to see if my hunch was correct, pretty much was.
8645	0	a	No Asian servers at all, unless you enjoy playing with 200+ connecting to Oceanic or US servers while constantly zapping back and forth or the ball going through your damn car continously, forget it.   It has been a month since promising Asian servers and yet nothing.
8646	0	a	game is very good I like it  If you want to play with your friends online you should have this because it's cool    BUT if you are like me having 3 controllers and 3 monitors you can not play each player with one monitor it got some weird resolution like 50% of the screen to the first player 25% to the second  25% to the third and you can't do any thing to make it fit like each player to his on monitor  if they add some kind of split screen setup staff in the next update it will be great
8647	0	a	I expected something like the deathball-mod from old unreal tournament 2004 just with cars and good physics like in gta v or any other average racing game (or at least ball physics like in pinball or billard simulations). furthermore i expected some fun aspects as in old games like destruction derby.   the first impression is still ok but the more you play the more flaws and annoying things you notice. the physics are terrible. the camera can't decide between being fixed at times or randomly turn. the cars have no brake, instead they stop instantly when you switch from forward to reverse. the cars bump around as if they are made of chewing gum. you can jump and turn the car in air like it has no weight at all. gravity is an issue anyway in this game. especially the ball gravity looks and feels totally weird.   so the look of this game might fool you to think that it's a fullprice game.  but the game mechanics feel like in alpha state or worse. even the new sumo mode in gta v is much more fun than this, cos at least the gravity works there...  can't recommend this.  not for $20 not for $10.  maybe in future for $0.99 in a humble bundle - but only if they fix the physics and car behaviour.
8648	0	a	I want it free! It's a good game but not enough good to be a game for money!

8673	0	a	Terrible gameplay
8674	0	a	Worst community of any game I have seen.. I have played a lot of hours.. and I have played cs:go... that takes some doing.. but the community in this game is the worst... ranked matches are full of people that should not be at your level and ruin your own personnal rank because their friend carried them... I strongly suggest not buying this game.. waste of money and time.
8675	0	a	Not something im willing to put any time into lots of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ annoying people 1v1's are luck and people are gay about it, just an annoying game.

8677	0	a	Garbage. They give you an option to not play certain maps, even for competitive, then put you in those same maps you turned off. Laggy ♥♥♥ servers and terrible matchmaking. Bs sensationalist physics in which the ball is pulled towards goal, often in the wrong direction of what the hit should have been. Toxic ppl, but the game brings that out if it wasn't there already. ♥♥♥♥. ROCKET. LEAGUE.

8681	0	a	Although I have 180 hours on this game I have found it hard to enjoy this game lately, after the recent updates to the game in online matches I have been receiving packet loss on 40 ping and it just gets worst as my ping rises. Constant rubber banding is frustrating while playing Rocket League. Until they fix this problem with packet loss i would postpone buying Rocket League
8682	0	a	Rocket League's unique gameplay mechanics allow you to play games such as soccer and hockey using cars capable of performing various stunts. As such, the gameplay is very fun, and playing offline with bots or in career mode works great. And having been included as part of the pre-order promotion, it is also one of the best games to play using the Steam Controller. However, a unique game like Rocket League deserves to be played with friends, but the game's terrible multiplayer support cripples that experience. While the game's ambitious multiplayer support aims to provide cross-platform play on both console and PC systems, it's servers struggle to keep up. Constant connection issues cause lag even on high-end systems, making it difficult to control your car and even harder to score goals. Offline mode works great but gets old fast; until its multiplayer issues are fixed, I will be unable to recommend Rocket League.
8683	0	a	The game itself is amazing, and has the potential to be incredibly fun, when played the right way. Unfortunately, the game becomes almost completely unplayable when your randomly-matched teammates don't hold up their end of the bargain.  Playing with friends is great! Unfortunately, for about 4 out of every 5 games I'm matched into (in unranked and ranked, mind you, which you would THINK would make a difference), at least one (and often both) of my teammates are either so inept that they hurt the team more than they help, they are selfish to the point that it isn't fun to play with them, they are spewing hateful (and super racist) chat messages because I'm trying to convince them to strategize instead of ballchasing, or (often) some combination of the three. Many times, my teammates will be sitting completely idle in matches for MINUTES at a time. Yet, I get penalized for leaving terrible matches.  Reporting people doesn't do anything. Matchmaking needs some serious work, or at least there needs to be some way to get into games with people with similar skills and mindsets.  Overall, one fun game in a blue moon isn't enough to outweigh the frustration this game causes.
8684	0	a	I can't really recommend this game because it's not running on my Linux platform. There have been several target dates that have been missed, but; I'm ever hopeful that today's commitment is realized. There are a few more hours for them to come through with a Linux RocketLeague.

8695	0	a	Sorry, but its like rolling a dice trying to predict the bounce(seems like when you are loosing its try to gives you better oportunities to shoot) and getting an straight shoot its tricky, so if you are near the ball you can roll in circles and the rival can easy gets the ball.... so annoying.... the game is fun at certain point... this game will get more on a free to play buisness model i think
8696	0	a	THIS UPDATE IS PEACE OF ♥♥♥♥!!  I DONT WANT PLAY THE ROCKET LABS MAPPS BUT NOW I MAST I HATE IT
8697	0	a	No report or kick function, and punishment for leaving games early.  10/10 Would play with racists, idiots and the colourblind again.
8698	0	a	If you are buying this to play with your friends on PS4, you will be disappointed.  The developers apparently see no need to mention that the cross platform play is only for random matchmaking and private games - you cannot queue up with friends that are on ps4.  That's why I bought the game, and that's the reason I got a steam refund.
8699	0	a	Pros: The game is different, and different is good. Unfortunately, the 'pros' stop right there.   Cons: There are many, so there's going to be a list 1. It's easily apparent to see when someone half-asses the engineering of the game. Inconsistent ball mechanics (the ball has intermittent weight and bounce abilities), cars with absolutely disastrous weight balance (they can't make up their mind if they're nose-heavy, or tail-heavy). I remember my first time making a video game. 2. I'm not sure what idiot thought it would be a great idea to pair rookies with people who forsake jobs, girlfriends, or even standing up occasionally to pee to make sure they spend thousands of hours attempting to be ridiculously good at this game. It's really nice seeing three expert-level players on one team who appear to be seamless extensions of each other, while I'm foundering around with two idiots who don't have even the vaguest idea as to what to do with a ball or how one might work. 3. The Call of Duty idiots who were ran out of that game, and bought this one since they sucked at first-person shooters. Yeah, it's pleasing to be rear-ended by teammates eleven times in one match, it's pleasing to have a ball stolen from you by a teammate, especially when you have a direct line into the opponent's goal, and he or she has come in from entirely the wrong angle, to hit the ball off in the wrong direction. This game has quite-possibly THE worst multiplayer game play that I've ever seen in that apoplectically-bad players can indeed ruin a match for you, and do so quickly...with no retribution from their teammates, no kick function, ban function, nothing, zip, zilch, nada.  4. It might be a good idea to force potential buyers of this game to provide photographic proof that they have actually picked up some kind of ball at least once in their lives, or even better yet, actually watched at least 30 seconds of a real soccer match, because it's absolutely freaking amazing to see people come into this game, and take a first-person shooter view of playing this game, with multiple instances of morons running over their own teammates in the attempt just to get a freaking goal. The Stupid is legendary in this game, and I hope this deters anyone else from buying this turd 5. The matchmaking system? Kind of nice seeing two pros and one semi-pro against two rookies and a semi-pro. Good job, guys.   Uninstalling this pile of crap as soon as I'm done with this review...or I might keep it just a while longer, in order to go back into online multiplayer, as the idiocy in there is absolutely fascinating. It's a great idea for a game, but absolutely horrible in execution, and the creators really have no idea just how stupid a lot of game players are.

8712	0	a	Worst game I've ever played in terms of ping advantage.  I have constant 60-80ms on European servers, and every time I duel someone with a substantial lower ping (20-40ms), It's just way too hard for me.  They always hit the ball first AND it always goes to my side of the field, when going head to head; They always hit the ball when they didn't even touch it;  Please fix your crap, otherwise I can't enjoy the game properly
8713	0	a	Wanna play a game with nothing but lag? BUY THIS. FIX YOUR SERVER LAG&gt;
8714	0	a	Fun game but matchmaking is pathetic, it's pretty much broken unranked as well as ranked. When you do get a balanced match it's great, but it doesn't happen often.  Seeing as this game at its core basically consists of one map and one car, you would think there would've been enough manpower to figure out a good matchmaking system.  Also great fun is when you lose connection to Psyonix's ♥♥♥♥ servers (happens rather frequently) in a ranked match and then get punished for 'leaving' the game by not being allowed to play anything for 15 minutes. ♥♥♥♥ YOU.  I can't count the number of games I bought and never played but I truly regret buying this piece of crap for 10.-, it's basically a minigame with broken mechanics. Get it for 2.-
8715	0	a	I play this game on the best mac you can get. And its ok. I get on average twenty frames per second. I dont like the fact that if you make one mistake you can lose the whole game.

8724	0	a	Psyonix is a shady development team breaking promises in games they develop. For reference take Nosgoth.
8725	0	a	Poor graphic performance...
8726	0	a	I like to call this game 'Football with cars' thats because its all it is (I don't give a ♥♥♥♥ about the basketball update).  Here are some positives: -The car customizations are pretty sweet and the maps are great too. -I like how the party system and the practice works in this game. -The graphics are pretty neat and the game is also able to run pretty smooth on a low end computer like mine.  Here is what ruined it for me: -The idea of football with cars sounds great on paper but in practice its unplayable (although I have to give them credit for the neat controls, at least it isn't as hard as playing football with cars would be in real life) the in-air controls could have used some work though (with that note pretty much the funnest thing to do in this game is ramming your opponents).  So thats pretty much it, I would tell you to play a different video game with football (or basketball, gahd what ever) instead of this but then again in my opinion they are all ♥♥♥♥ and you should just play those sports in real life (if you can't then I am sorry but you will never truly enjoy it... EVER!). This game is pretty over hyped just like CS:GO, League of Legends, Dota 2, Rust, Ark, and others that have not come out yet or I havent heard of.  P.S. you should also remember that this is my peorsonal opinion of the game from my (1 hour) experience with the game, if you enjoy it then good for you, go play it
8727	0	a	Literally fifa with cars, gets boring after 2 games
8728	0	a	Well, it looked and sounded great. But know this now: it does not work for Mac. i'm hoping they fix that soon because it doesn't say it on the page and I wasted 20 bucks. I want a refund of my money and will ask for one. If you are on a PC that is Windows, while you can play you are bound to experience much lag. So this only really works if you have a certain kind of computer, which is not specified before you download the game.
8729	0	a	literally the worst game I've ever played. Let me edit this real quick. Literal ♥♥♥♥ing garbage.

8730	0	a	This game looked cool but turned out to be pretty childish, then again I'm more of a shooter and fps type of guy.
8731	0	a	Started playing this during a free-to-play weekend. Bought it because playing soccer in rocket cars turned out to be more fun than I expected. Do not recommend because I like to get as many achievements as I can and you cannot get all of them without buying multiple DLC. Big turn-off for me when games do that.

8734	0	a	This game is fantastic. I haven't been this excited by a game in years! The Oceanic servers however, seem to run on coal...

8745	0	a	There's a ball, and you bump it with your little car.  Sometimes, it goes into a little space, designated as the 'your team scores a point' location. Sometimes, it goes into a similar space designated as 'the other team scores a point'. This second thing is apparently bad, because only one team can have the most points, and you can't let that happen to the other team, because they are colored differently and therefore are evil.  More frequently, the ball goes somewhere else, and all that happens is all the cars run after it mindlessly, without much trace of reason or strategy.  This repeats, endlessly, across multiple sessions, defined by an arbitrary time limit for putting the ball into the designated area.  If you can suffer through multiple such sessions, the game will grant you parts to make your car look different from how it looked before.  Somehow, this game has lots of positive reviews.

8753	0	a	Racist League  So you download a game just to find out your country is listed as blocked countries in this game. why? because of polictical reasons, all countries which are under USA sanctions are banned in this game and the developer has created a sticky post about this on community hub and listed the country names.  To the developers and most americans who think only USA is in this world and no where else: Do you think life is a video game that you can choose your birth place like spawn location that you need to pay the price for getting born in a country which is not being loved by USA democracy policies? it is my first time ever seeing a video game doing this i had seen Anti viruses such as AVG block updates for countries under USA sanctions but for a video game on steam this is new.  Well done! and people hate EA and Ubisoft...
8754	0	a	Super unrealistic, the spectators are eggs that have vocal cords, cars can can drive up walls at 3mph, the giant metal ball does no damage to your vehicles and vice versa.  1/10             Stop looking for a reason to not buy this game, it's fun as f**k.
8755	0	a	The game is just boring... It's fine with friends..
8756	0	a	Provides a few hours of entertainment but lacks gameplay variety and the lack of meaningful lateral movement becomes frustrating, making it needlessly difficult to orientate yourself and coming across as a 90's car combat game anachronism. All vehicles handle the same, all arenas have the same dimensions, and there's really only one game mode; options basically begin and end with being able to tweak the ball size and weight.  I'd wait to see what kind of free content updates this receives or wait until it is steeply discounted before purchasing.

8763	0	a	Overly simplistic. No real strategy. Ball spends most of its time floating in the air rather than under the control of any given player. Idiot teammates constantly screw up good shots by ramming. Game temporarily bans you from matchmaking if you leave midgame.

8769	0	a	This game is tearable, I spent $20 on it and all it did was lag. I you want to spend your money on nothing go right ahead.
8770	0	a	This game is based only on the luck.  If you win a match, play lottery :)     Ez $$$$
8771	0	a	The game has glitches(like no 1080p settings, needed ini change) or in the tutorial to jump left.  It's hard to kick the ball where you want, the controls can cause hand pain. It's frustrating and not fun.

8782	0	a	This game is dumb, how do I sell it for 20 €?
8783	0	a	this game would be great   If i wasnt paired with the stupidest motherfockers they could find every goddamm game.  If you plan on playing with teamwork you can forget that. All anyone does is ram whatever the fock is in front of them. You, the ball, the wall, the focking cieling All this game does is start you in multiplayer hell where no one is competent at all. seriously fock this game. dont get it.
8784	0	a	I dont understand this game. Everyone plays 10 placements and get down bottom to prospect 1. So why have placements when you start from bottom anyway? I just hate that i must now wait couple weeks to get nice balanced matches. Its not even funny to have newbies and legends in same match!  Its in the sale, you can buy it now but dont waste your time on now. Do something funnier for couple weeks... 
8785	0	a	Playing with friends and messing around but for competitive, it is absolute garbage. The ball physics just follow their own rules and are never the same bounce height or roll speed. It can hit a wall going mach 10 and bounce back an inch from the wall. Absolute, horrible physics. I don't know why there's a ranked mode if the physics aren't correct. Completely unfair. That's not all either, the cars follow their own random physics rules as well. Sometimes go from 0-100 in 1 second or sometimes go from 0-100 in 5 seconds. Was fun until I realized how unfair this game can be. Fix it and then we'll see if I recommend it.
8786	0	a	.
8787	0	a	They recommend using controller but I couldn't even map it. Ended up using keyboard. Playing is as boring as football. Out of my wishlist
8788	0	a	The game is OK, but the community is pure cancer!!!
8789	0	a	Good graphics, nice idea, but boring. The enthusiasm to play this game lasted a couple of days, then it just becomes repetitive and boring, too bad I cant get my money back...
8790	0	a	I bought this game 3 months ago and I really enjoy it until game starts to discconect me in ranked matches. In the middle of the rank match it's just disconnects me. Other cars start to do circle, can't take boost and clock stops. That's why i start to lose all my ranked matches thanks to rocket league servers. And it bans me 15 minutes for disconnecting. If they can't fix this i'm going to erase the game because it is useless and it's not giving pleasure any more. Waste of money.
8791	0	a	The emense ♥♥♥♥ mm is teaming you up with salty noobs all the time. Its very frustrating. If you have played dota2, and know ITS matchmaking, it is very similar to this. If you want to ease yourself from the pain that this game puts on you, don't buy. Very buggy/laggy ball, which makes it impossible to predict where the ball is going to hit.
8792	0	a	While, in theory, you can play with people on the playstation version. You are not able to actively play with a friend who owns the playstation version while you have the PC version. I'd never play this kind of game without playing with a friend so I say don't pick up this game if you were gonna play it cross console with your friends.
8793	0	a	not for mac
8794	0	a	Loot crates for additionnal content and you have to buy keys.....
8795	0	a	Better than Cars 2
8796	0	a	Game laggs way too much. Want a refund!
8797	0	a	Do you want to play a game that is a fair? Do you want to play a game that rewards skill? Then keep looking.... This game is Satan's lovechild with a ♥♥♥♥ing Leprechaun. You could dominate the game through aerials, dribbles, reverse flips etc. and then the first-timer will get one shot that bounces off of your car, 3 walls and into your goals... It is complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. The way to win in this game is to sit in goals all game and clear the ball up the park which usually goes in whilst the high-skilled opponent is struggling to get back to save it.  10/10 for Rookie Players 1/10 for Players looking to get better.
8798	0	a	gets pretty boring really fast.

8801	0	a	What's with this CSGO and TF2 skinnerbox player marketplace crap? This is not an F2P game. I don't PLAY F2P games. Are we just sheep to be fleeced and corralled? Why can't all the players have all the nice items?
8802	0	a	Worst $20 I ever spent. ♥♥♥♥ you EmmHaych for recommending this piece of trash to me.
8803	0	a	Used to be fun, now if your internet isnt the best and you drop connection you cant play for FIFTEEN ♥♥♥♥ING DAYS. WHO THOUGHT OF THIS. 0/10 ♥♥♥♥ you.
8804	0	a	This game has a good concept but it is poorly executed. The game's controlls are uncumfortable and not natural. The game also needs a beter bot AI. The bot AI in this game is trash. It goes from no bots, to really bad, to sort of bad, to really good, to super good, Thus the single player of the game does not improve player skill for multiplayer matches. The game also gets repetitive. I have not even played the game for that long and I hate the repetition, sure you can choose a new car and design it but the cars all have the same stats. To make this game more interessting cars should have varied stats and a community market should be added. If a community market where added to this game allowing the user to buy hats with special effects or special parts this game would be more interesting and give the user something to build for. These knew items would be unboxed in crates costing a dollar each to unbox. This would boost the games popularity among the users possible drawing in new people. Adding the crates would also put the game on the community market and it would bring in more money for the game developers to add knew things such as maps. The maps are the same basic layout over and over again. The devs should either keep updating the maps or add a community workshop to the game so users can play with mods and on different maps. All of these items together would improve the game from where it stands and make it an essentail in steam along with gmod and cs go. The rating for the game right now is probably a 5/10, until further changes are made i cannot give this game a thumbs up.
8805	0	a	This game ruined my life
8806	0	a	Boring
8807	0	a	DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! The game is unplayable as is. Teams are divided into 2 - Orange and Blue. Except with car customizations, cars on the field will be almost every color imaginable! Purple, Red, Green, Car's that are both Orange and Blue at the same time??! What team is that car on? Just try and figure out who to pass to! What a mess! As a designer I'm offended. As an avid player of this game I just stopped. What other sport on the planet allows this garbage? NONE And it will never be fixed because all this garbage is in game purchases - they sell this nonsense. Add an option so I can hide your mistake!
8808	0	a	i downloaded it but its not running this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ steam
8809	0	a	Please describe what you liked or disliked about this game and whether you recommend it to others. xd hi im rocket league and eye crash a lot xd yes my laptop sucks but I can still play older games like crysis with maximum settings so it can't be that bad for RocketPenis to decide not to work
8810	0	a	I PAYED MONY TO PLAY THIS GAME AND IT SAYS I CANT BLY IT BECASE OF AN UNDECIDED ERROR
8811	0	a	Why I hate this game 1. ♥♥♥♥ controls. Despite playing with both a keyboard and a controller the controls were still un responsive and slow 2. cs casual. same as in csgo casual you get pu into games with people of varying skill levels making the game a lot less fun 3. leaving. after the other team scored a point at least one of my team members would say 'gg' and leave 4. skill or luck. you have no control over where the ball goes or wether or not you hit the ball...i mean it...the ball is infront of me i go straight and hit it but NOPE now its to my back left...WHY...the game is all luck (and some skill but very very very little) 5. price tag. so many games are so much better and also cheaper...i know 15$ isn't a lot but for this its a ripoff thank you for reading my review keep in mind this is just my opinion no need to over react (i know you will)
8812	0	a	Well, this game is a piece of ♥♥♥♥..., don't buy.
8813	0	a	Used to be fun. Since last season I suck. Deinstall right now!! GG, never play again!

8819	0	a	bad football manager 2014 ripoff
8820	0	a	I was playing ranked doubles with my friend. We were winning agains some playstation people who were tagged Frenchfrizzle and Frenchfrizzle (2). All of a sudden the screen went black in the middle of the game and we were switched into a custom lobby for mutator match. Needless to say we left the non ranked game that it put us and and received a 15 minute penalty for leaving a ranked game. Not sure if these were hacks or maybe admin accounts but either way, with the updates causing multiple computer types to freeze and crash along with being banned from matchmaking for no reason, this game seems to becoming more buggy.
8821	0	a	Worst. 'Community'. Ever.
8822	0	a	Fun but takes a bit of practice 
8823	0	a	Toxic Community.
8824	0	a	This is seriously the worst game i have ever layed my eyes upon, this game is so disgustingly bad save your money and buy something else please don't buy this game its horrible.  Ok let me just make one thing clear ok? People in 2015 have certain criteria that needs to be met when it comes to there video games. People in 2015 expect guns and violence and death when it comes to their video games, so far this game meets none of that criteria unfortunately. You dont even customize your guy so you can see him split in half by a car all you do in this ♥♥♥♥ is drive remote controlled cars in a box and hit a ball. You think im joking? Thats seriously all there is to this game there is no strategy to this game whatsoever.   It's worth noting that there is no team deathmatch or capture the flag in this game, there is only one mode in this game which limits variety. In this mode players of two teams try to hit the ball to there net and win, maybe some people who are 5 years old can get any enjoyment out of this game, but since im an adult this crap just doesnt cut it for me. This game should be marketed to toddlers and little kids because there is no strategy or depth to this game, its boring as sin and in 2015 i really expect more from my games.  In conclusions  This is probably the worst games i have ever seen in my entire life for this review im giving this game a -15/10 worst game ever.  
8825	0	a	This game is made for getting more money. Psyonix is making fancy maps to 'make it better for community'. But they are just doing new maps to get money. There isn't any fun to play in these maps. They can't make a map choise. They created a like/dislike system but they ♥♥♥♥ed up it. You can dilike only 2 maps outta 4 fancy maps. Just dropping fps. I want to play this game by try harding, but they just say: 'We don't have a lot of players so let's make more maps to make it interestin for people who don't give a ♥♥♥♥ about this game'. So the players who wants to be better can't in standard maps. They need to play in some parody of maps. So I want to say : ♥♥♥♥ YOU PSYONX!!!
8826	0	a	I Previouslly game this game a thumbs up, but after a long while of more playing I'm saddend to have to change it.   It's really simple actully: Ranked mode is broken. I know ranked isnt the entire game, but it's such a huge part of it I have to change my review.  Let me tell you how it's broken. It does not matter how well you play a match, it could be the closest most skill based match of your life, but it doesnt matter. If you lose, you lose just as many points as you would have gained if you won. If match making is working as it should, you should be matched agasint people around the same skill as you. Meaning that the average player is winning around 50% of the time in ranked mode.  Do you see where I'm going? if you win 50% of games, you make no progress at all. Even if you win 53% of the time, it's still not enough to gain you levels at a realistic rate. I know because my win percentage is 53%. In all the hours I've played I've only just broken bronze 1 rank and then lost it the very next game. I predict that you'd need to win around 60+% of the time to make ANY KIND of reasonable progress in raked mode.  You feel so freaking stuck. because even if you do break the cycle and start getting better a the game, it's not long before you're paired up with people just as good as you again.  HOW TO FIX IT: Base rank points of how well you play the game for christ sake! not just if you win or lose. I could have a dozen saves and 4 epic saves, lose by one point, and be down just as many points as if i just drive around in circles for the whole ♥♥♥♥ing game! how is that fair???   TL:DR: You need to be decently above average to progress in ranked mode. Rank is based only on if you win or lose, and not on how well you play.   if they fix how ranked points are calculated, ill change my review.
8827	0	a	THIS GAME SUCKS AWFUL TEAM BALANCE SYSTEM, NO BANS FOR UNFAIR CONDUCT, RANK SECTION IS FULL OF PEOPLE WHO WANT TO WASTE OTHERS GAMES JUST SUCKS TOTALLY DO NOT BUY THIS BULLSHT TILL THEY FIX ANYTHING !!!!!!
8828	0	a	Probably the dumbest way to spend your time. It's all about stupid little milleseconds of pressing buttons. It's like you would try to fit the end of a yarn into a needle. You can learn it, you will get better, but it's just not something you can really enjoy. The game is well designed, Graphically wonderful and the menu is very practical, but the concept of the game is just total ♥♥♥♥. Nothing to do here.
8829	0	a	this game is great but keys and crates why. who want that i love this game and fun for love but keys come on there are other ways of make this game great. like have about custom falg option lol guys new csgo lotto this is not waht the game is about and wach this hurt the game :( sad day sad day so no if you are new i do not recommend this game under $20 wach the youtube for all that i think Lightningmaloy i am going to cry in the csgo room :(
8830	0	a	played 1 game and then said to myself what a pile of trash
8831	0	a	Might be fun playing against human opponents, but the only season option is against AI, which cheats rather blatantly (able to predict exactly where ball will land, etc.). Ball also has screwed physics - the inertia of a soccer ball, but the hang-time of a beach ball, making it impossible for anyone other than AI to predict where it's going. Camera angles are also terribly misleading. In short, this game is an invitation to frustration.
8832	0	a	Piece of crap keeps crashing after the second season update and it penalizing me for 'disconnecting'.
8833	0	a	Any physics in this game?
8834	0	a	No native support for split-screen with one player as keyboard and another as controller. Very lazy by the developers.
8835	0	a	this game is total ♥♥♥♥ lol. it may be fun wiht others but alone is no way fun. the matchmaking is broken, too many idiots runing your game and scoring in their own side, too many kids trolling. this is like a moba with cars, toxic, not fun,everyone leaving after 1 goal. ♥♥♥♥ game 3/0  i dont even bought this game, i write the review in free weekend, dont deserve my money.

8844	0	a	Overrated and overhyped to say the least. It's just soccer with cars. Gets really boing really fast. Almost impossible to use with a keyboard. Grab your controllers. Only fun with friends who know what they're doing.  Go get FIFA 16 or Super Mario Strikers. Those are better soccer games. B)

8853	0	a	4/10. This game is great to play with/against friends. If you want to play alone, then be prepared to play with/against the scum of the earth. Psyonix doesnt do anything against toxic behaviour amongst the community. I can't even report player for Nazi Parols. Muting every communication channels seems to be the only way to enjoy this game.
8854	0	a	10/10 ♥♥♥♥ING 10 WOULD GET PUSHED 30 TIMES IN A SINGLE ♥♥♥♥ING MATCH ♥♥♥♥ THIS GAME
8855	0	a	All I need to say about this game is: Please fix your servers!  I've been playing the game for less than an hour and every match thay i've joined i'm constantly lagging/rubber banding all over the map. One second I'm driving towards the ball the next second i find myself in the back of my own goal.  I mean seriously why has this not been fixed? I know this isn't my fault since I'm getting a decent amount of ping (20-40).  So i beg of you. Please fix your servers.  Until then I'll be requesting a refund.
8856	0	a	I personally dont like this game too much because of all of the connection errors in it. They are also implementing cases into the game. I think this is stupid because out of all things, we don't need another CS:GOesk game. Thumbs down for connection errors and case implementation.
8857	0	a	great game! but no so great game!   #broken-physics-simulator-2016
8858	0	a	It's not what I expected to be honest. If you enjoy the game it's ok but this game is getting way too many positive reviews. It's a great concept but it's really boring. If you want to enjoy the game I guess you need to buy all the DLC's

8862	0	a	if you want a rage worthy piece of ♥♥♥♥ that bails out the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ players then this is the garbage for you it takes out the fun of the game for higher ranks when it makes sure you cant beat a rookie or someone lower level then you ive played alot of hours but its just to rage worthy for anyone that thinks that they will win if they play a rookie or semi pro im a vet and division rank prospect but i kill every game with 6+ goals and still ranked low this game shouldnt get the hype it has such ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t...
8863	0	a	the camera F**king sucks, DLC F**king sucks, go kill yourself bruh.
8864	0	a	WTF is wrong with the KI. My own team regularely kicks me out of my trail, DRIVES THE ♥♥♥♥ING BALL IN OUR OWN GOAL (and that with no opponents and half of the goddamm field open), and generally tries everything to sabotage my setups. Waste of money thanks for nothing.
8865	0	a	Dear Rocket League Developers, If I ever see a car hitting a massive ball again, I will slit my wrists and mail the blood in a bag to your office, and I will chop off my ♥♥♥♥♥ and ship that to you aswell. Adding on to that, my 83 billion dollar company will buy out Universal Studios and terminate the contract allowing you to have your Back to The Future DLC. I will also buy out all of your wokers and pay them millions if they eliminate your family. Your worste nightmare Drug Lord

8869	0	a	its pretty boring
8870	0	a	Has potential but matchmaking and ranked system is horrible. Matches lower level players with higher and tends to stack the teams. Almost every game is one sided. If you want competition stay far far away. If you want to play on occasional non ranked game with teammates that will make you question humanity then look no farther.
8871	0	a	I feel like this game is too overhyped and really not that fun. It's a novel idea, cars playing soccer, but to me, it just didn't stick out. And to add, the controls are masochistic and takes forever to get the hang of.
8872	0	a	Fun at first. but gets boring after awhile.
8873	0	a	If you play with the Keyboard, you're screwed.
8874	0	a	Its fun. And the fact you get items after EVERYgame, win or lose is great!  But its so over priced... Its only now starting to add new content. But its to late. What makes it worse is that you have to pay even more to make the game even slightly better....  TL;DR - Way over priced. Only get it if its £5 or under
8875	0	a	im a salty hater, this game sucks, uninstalled.
8876	0	a	♥♥♥♥ this game and everyone who plays it.
8877	0	a	Can't play with my steering wheel...
8878	0	a	are you tired of hackers in CS? are you tired of VACs false promises? Do you think this game is going to be different?  It is a good game , but hackers are so heavy, just play the game and say ' why do you have a VAC ban?', and 2-3 people will respond with why they hack, but in their minds its ok, so if you like HVAC or HACK games, this is a great. pre-hacker 8.1, post hack 3 less then h1hacz
8879	0	a	The ranked matchmaking system is pure ♥♥♥♥, u play alone with 2 noobs in a team vs 2 very good guys and 1 bad guy in 3v3 solo. 3v3 is team based so, how can i get up ranks with noob mates? pls check this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ match making system out and repair it. I dont talk about normal matches, there r only noobs. SO my statement is, the game is nice and fun but the matchmaking is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t
8880	0	a	there are no au server so it is very hard to play in australia
8881	0	a	Generally speaking, fun and enjoyable game. However, it´s just nice for some time, then it gets boring, same thing over and over again, sometimes the servers are super laggy :( Although I use to play with 2 or 3 friends, which makes it way more fun, at some point it got just way too boring, cannot recommend it but for 3 or 5 euros if you´d like to give it a shot.
8882	0	a	This is the most cancerous game i've ever played. I've never been this fustrated about a ♥♥♥♥ing cancer game. It's always the same ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, there's this one ♥♥♥♥♥♥ that flies to the ball like a ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ with his ears straight up in his ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I recommend nobody to waste any money on this cancerous piece of ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ing game. This game really just gave cancer, in the ♥♥♥♥, i now have ♥♥♥♥ cancer. Thanks for reading. Please donate to GIRO 500, let nobody die of this piece of cancer. Thanks for reading.
8883	0	a	Until they fix their broken matchmaking that is unfair and completely unrewarding. A rookie (the first ranking for first time players) might get matched with a veteran (the highest ranked of players and the most experienced) and if the rookie managed to beat the veteran after a deathly match with an exceptional performance they will get the same points they get playing against any other ranking of same level or lower/higher. That is extremely frustrating and wasting of time and effort and is true to all different match modes. Be advised and save your temper!
8884	0	a	Love this game. However playing ranked game as normal, 2 v 2, and were kicked and banned from ranked by some unknown admin. We were playing Frenchfrizzle and Frenchfrizzle(2). They were losing an so we get kicked and banned? Why the hell would anyone pay $20 for a game when their admins are going to throw hissy fits?!  Note to Frenchfrizzle and others(if applicable): Grow up and stop acting like little girls. Anyone who's willing to pay $20 for a simple game on Steam should be praised.  If you dare to respond I'd be happy to accept an appology.  In summary, if you enjoy playing fair games on steam don't buy this one...
8885	0	a	Rocket League, a game which had dashed in the right direction but which lost its spirit of game with the updates: - Random system of earnings of rank/division in the classified matches (why do you have removed the points system?), - Abolition of the public server 'Snow Day' (we must create a private server without password hoping that players come with you to play on this game mode)  - system of 'mute/report' which stirs up controversy in view of its excessive use by players who don't support the defeat (in classified match or not)  - orientation of the game towards a professional world (e-sport competition), goodbye the good-natured spirit  I regret having invested in their DLC to end in this result now. The mentality of a lot of players aims towards what know games such as League of Legends (very heavy be offended 3 times on 4 during matches solo when we score a point or to be decreased when the opponent scores a point).  =========  Rocket League, un jeu qui s'était lancé dans la bonne direction mais qui a perdu son esprit de jeu au fil des mises à jour :  - système aléatoire de gain de 'rang'/division dans les classés (pourquoi avoir retiré le système de points ?),  - suppression du serveur public 'Snow Day / Jour de Glace' (obligé de créer un serveur privé sans mot de passe en espérant que des joueurs viennent avec vous pour jouer sur ce mode de jeu) - système de 'mute/report' (couper le micro / reporter un mauvais comportement) qui fait polémique au vue de son utilisation abusive par des joueurs qui ne supportent pas la défaite (que ça soit en match classé ou non) - orientation du jeu vers un monde professionnel (compétition e-sport), au revoir l'esprit bon enfant  Je regrette d'avoir investi dans leurs DLC pour aboutir à ce résultat actuellement. La mentalité de bon nombre de joueurs tend vers ce que connaissent les jeux comme League of Legends ( très lourd de se faire insulter 3 fois sur 4 durant des matchs solo quand on marque un point ou de se faire rabaisser quand l'adversaire marque un point).
8886	0	a	I loved this game until the new season started. After the update though, I'm playing against people that are WAY better than I am and consistantly get noobs on my team... seriously, 3 Veteran ranked people on one team and 2 pros with a semi-pro? I get the ranking system but PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT and if the other people have played that much then they need to be playing others that have had that much practice.   I would recommend IF the devs:  1) fixed the ranked games to be more fairly matched 2) if they will fix the new season ranks so people who were 1 point away from gold are not playing people who had just gotten to silver 3) if they fix the ranked exp system! I win 2 matches, then lose 1 and lose over half the exp I gained in the wins, even if I had the most points in the game I lost.  This game is Super addicting, but a lot of the mechanics are so frustrating it is unreal.

8890	0	a	Most boring game ever... not recommended for more than 30 mins/play no point of playing... cars like idiots driving around hitting a ball with jumps and turbo boosts...WOW,so much innovation in a game...i cant handle it.. 
8891	0	a	Consistent Inconsistencies  There's a particular reason im thumbing down Rocket League. This Football with Cars Type of game is beautifully executed, has a clear visual style, tight controls (although partially frustrating on double-jumps not adjusting when using ball-focused camera) and a huge following. So huge, it caused massive outages in its early days. Those are luckily a thing of the past and it's a great party game because of its built-in splitscreen.  While the game has a certain simplicity to it, the advanced moves such as aerial kicks, handbreak slides and precision shots can offer a huge skill ceiling.  And that's where the huge problem comes in. This game is consistently inconsistent. After you've hit a certain rank and skill level yourself, you will notice HUGE sways in game results based on sheer luck and ♥♥♥♥ery in the physics system. Even at 20 milliseconds of ping, you will regularly phase through the ball, hit it clearly but 'miss' it, while it does a twitching animation reminiscent of early access games and concede frustrating amounts of goals not because your opponents were the better players, but simply because the way momentum given to the ball especially in pressed situations is so utterly unreliable it makes you wish to avoid engaging in pressed balls alltogether (which believe me is not a great strategy because it leaves you very vulnerable to long-range shots).  It should be of positive mention that the developers have kept upgrading the game with additional visual content as well as new game-modes, although they're nothing special, just your run-of-the-mill modifiers you'd expect from an arcade racing game. A bunch of it is in DLC-form (total cost at this point 13,96€) including a rather dodgy Delorian from Back to the Future which may or may not grant you in-game advantages. I personally found my winrate increasing ~10% when using it and memorably losing more commonly against it, but that might just be down to too small sample size of only 180+ hours.  The competetive scene for this title has remained rather small and lost a lot of viewers very early on as a result of these issues. There are amazing montages of pro-players to be found on the web, but they obviously do not contain those moments when it shouldve been a goal/save, but wasnt. Unless you have the patience and nerves of steel to improve yourself to skill levels where you completely dominate your opponents, you will frequently lose to slightly weaker opponents simply because they had more of those 'twitchy' moments go in their favor. You can even see the pros adapt to this, as they favor long-range shots and a stationary goalkeeper just to keep the randomness of a closer approach on a smaller scale, and sorry, if the pros at your e-sport have to change their playstyle to adapt to how bad your physics work, in a physics based football game, you have failed.  So, if you're just looking for a casual party-game with inexperienced players tumbling around and scoring hilarious yet rather awkward goals, go for it. But if you'd want to actually explore the skill ceiling and compete with others in the ranked ladders, don't bother. You're more likely to make holes into your equipment in rage, than to beat the game's consistent inconsistencies.  February Update:  With the Season 2 Update to Rocket League, even more of my previously negatively mentioned inconsistencies have been intentionally added into the game. You may now experience matches, even in the ranked ladders, on non-default maps completely at random. Not only are some of these maps intentionally designed to enable inconsistencies (curved walls leading to vastly different deflection angles based on the height the ball hits them) but you may also play on that map completely at random, meaning if you are not accustomed to whatever map shape you're playing on, and the other team is, because they've been playing on that map-type for a match or more in a row, you'll have another layer of randomized advantage and disorientation. Also, the developers intentionally patched the feature to forfeit the match before kickoff, resulting in a canceled match at a reduced point less (to potentiall skip the aforementioned sand map) out of ranked queues, leaving you completely at the whim or RNG to be forced to play on a map you may not be accustomed to.  Additionally, matchmaking for the randomized player queues has been obscured, in that it no longer displays you any progression in your rank. You may find yourself de- or upranking after any match, based on your 'performance' (which is basically nothing else than your in-game score) meaning you now get additionally penalized for a defensive playstyle which tends to be a safer choice but yield lower scores than a risky all-out attack strategy. It also takes the ranks of the players you're matched with into account for the ranking changes you no longer get shown, so hurray for even more RNG. If this review would have a score, it wouldve gone down from a 7/10 to a 6/10 simply because of the developers unrelenting intent to patch more inconsistencies into the game.
8892	0	a	Pros +Fun and unique game mechanics that feel well designed and fleshed out Diving off of walls to stop the other team's game winning goal is satisfying everytime. +graphics look nice and game runs well 60 fps, nice interface etc. +No issues with lag from servers (although some have complained about it) +Split-screen multiplayer Speaks for itself Cons -Lack of game modes/variety This is my biggest complaint about the game. The game only has one standard game mode, there's no differences between cars other than visuals, and only a handful of arenas to play at, which again, do not affect gameplay. I understand the game is trying to create a competitve experience, which means skill has to come before luck and in-game car upgrades, however, I feel this is a valid complaint. -Lackluster single player mode I understand, again, that this is a primarily multiplayer, competitive game. However, the singleplayer modes offered are extremely shallow. The primary modes are exhibition (a single match) and a league mode. However, the league mode struggles because all of the cpu teams are set to the same difficult setting (easy, medium or hard). This means that once I beat one team, the other matches should generally go the same way, as none of the cpu characters play different from one another (from what I've seen). The league mode ends up feeling more suited towards the multiplayer game because of this but is not available in multiplayer. -Controller support Many controllers generally do not work with this game. While there is a fix on the forums to correct this, the fix brings up a new issue. For example, if I have an xbox controller (which, by default works with the game) and my friend has a logitech controller (which, by default does NOT work with the game) and I attempt the fix posted on the forum, at best I can allow my friend's logitech controller to work, however, my controller will no longer work. The fix only corrects the problem if all players are using the same type of controller. I returned the game because of this issue.   Overall, for 20 dollars I think the game provides an enjoyable that will ultimately end up being hit or miss for a lot of people. Personally, I felt the lack of variety in the game took away from it's lasting appeal and I didn't feel the core gameplay was enough to keep me playing.This, in addition to the controller support issue, leads me to not recommend this game. While I know many people may enjoy it, I feel a large number of people may also feel similarly to me, and a majority of the reviews neglect to point out the issues with single player and variety as a whole within the game.   
8893	0	a	Unplayable as a PC game with mouse and keyboard. Entirely designed to allow console kiddies to 'break into' pc gaming by playing a good game that PC users want to play. Said design makes it completely impossible to play for any PC user who has more control of their games with their entire hand, wrist, and arm (THIS IS ALL PC USERS) than they do with their thumbs (ONCE AGAIN, EVERY HUMAN BEING EVER).  Waste of 20 bucks. I'm not downgrading my skill level to play a game.
8894	0	a	Rocket League, AKA. Cars 'n Balls, Football Cars, Top Gear Car Football simulator. Would rate 9.8/10 but to be a 10 would require the game to include a Tuk Tuk DLC in the future.  Therefore I do no reccommend this game, and will only change my reccomendation when a Tuk Tuk DLC is added so I can follow me dreams of becoming a professional Tuk Tuk Footbal driver and make my father proud so he stop beating me savagely with a coconut every night.

8910	0	a	Plays a lot like the game should be a free game. Physics are really wacky in the game, but I guess if you want a game with rocket cars playing soccer you aren't looking for a realistic game. However, not worth the $20 for such a minimal game. Servers could also be better.

8912	0	a	Dear developers and people looking to buy this game,   When I start the game, I get a black screen. I tried everything listed here:  http://steamcommunity.com/app/252950/discussions/0/490123197959278754/#c490123938425933422  NOTHING WORKED. When launching it windowed, I got a small screen of 1 pixel high and like 30 wide or so, which did nothing. We specially bought this game to play it tonight, however, while the rest is playing, I am trying to get the game to work on my PC. I don't see any reason why this would be the customers task, and not the developers' task. I don't even care with this review whether I ever get it to work, I am not ever changing this to a yes. I would not recommend a game that does not launch correctly to anyone.  To everyone looking to buy this game, know it might randomly not work on you PC for no apparent reason at all. I'd not spend 20 euro's on it. Maybe 1.

8926	0	a	This game is terrible. It is boring, useless, and a waste of your life playing. The gameplay is bad, (not mentioning the impossible keyboard controls), and it wears out after 20 minutes. My friends got so overly obsessive over this game they are neglecting school time, any other games, and any friends that don't play rocket league every second like them. They have not only been obsessive, but just plain rude. They make fun of me for being bad at the game, they tease me, don't let me in on secrets, and just scream at me when trying to talk to them. This game is complete bull****, and shouldn't even be released to the public. Do not get this game, unless you want no life.

8939	0	a	Servers are trash at the moment. Keep timing out of games and lagging here and there. Then this happens 'You are banned 15 minutes from matchmaking' Why? Because I 'left the game early' for timing out of servers that I have clear connections to.   I'm not getting these type of issues in any other game.
8940	0	a	Great game but recently ive been getting crashes. I would be playing ranked, which isnt a good time for bugs to be appearing, and i would get a green screen for 20 seconds then i would go back into the game. Its happened enough for me to write this review. please fix or I will have to stop playing.
8941	0	a	GET A REPORT SYSTEM GOING - NOW!
8942	0	a	Seems that skill level does not apply in ranked matches so you have a constant struggle to achieve anything at all. I've been up quite far only to have it all gone with many bad players. Then you get a penalty for forfeit. Very frustrating. Only way it works is with your own team of friends who can actually understand how this game is played.. So you are forced to play with subpar players most of the time if your friends are not playing. Hope they figure this out. Needs a better system for skill evaluation.
8943	0	a	Would be fun, but terrible hitboxes, physics bugs, nonsense startformation and advantages for lagging players make it impossible to play for casual fun because there are lots of people abusing those unwanted mechanics. Playing with more than 2 people also makes it so that you could basicly not move at all and have the same effect on the game.  Yeah I am terrible at it, but you should not need over 100h of expierience to enjoy a game like this.  Usually a ranking system helps with finding players of your caliber, but not here. You start with a random amount of points. ( I started with 500 Points, my friends with 0 or 100.) And since you only loose about 5 points per game it would take around 50-100 games to get to the ranking with your type of players. Which is not doable for casual play and also makes it freakn frustrating.  Even if you are on the winning side, it feels extremly uncomfortable since the enemy gives up after maximal 2 goals and you just wait out the rest of those 5 minute games, not shooting since it would only prolong this farce. Or they ragequit, what also feels stupid. So you end up with those who have either more expierience or abuse the bugs and seem to move with boost all the time, flying for the whole 5 minutes.  I had fun when i started playing, but as with most online games, the community ruins it after a while. Playing with friends is a lot of fun though. Just take care and dont take it to seriously or improve to fast since it will become very one sided very quick.   I do not recommend.
8944	0	a	♥♥♥♥ off ♥♥♥♥ this game legitimately can suck my dads fat ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥. I have spent a total of 200 hours on this ♥♥♥♥ing piece of ♥♥♥♥ and i dont really know why.

8945	0	a	It is good if you have friends to play it with. But if you dont then you will get put into games with people with no common sense. And this game should be put as a early access because it clearly has flaws like the steering the lag issues and the people with no common sense. I mean if you have a teamate dont go for the ball when they have a better shot then you.
8946	0	a	So after refunding this game i decided i was being harsh on the game so i gave this game another chance. Boy, was i wrong to give this game another chance. It says i have 10 ping but no im lagging like a f*cking b*tch over here like wtf is this and also the match making and that is f*cking terrible too! im a rookie and im getting put with pros and semi-pros this isnt right its making my gameplay bad because i playing with people who have a lot more skill and knowledge at the game so i dont get a good chance.....  So i wouldnt recoment getting this game, infact, dont get it at all.
8947	0	a	It's fun, but hard to have fun and highly annoying to play because the team balancing system is crap. Almost every game so far as a rookie it's been me and two other rookies against veterans and pro players and it's nearly impossible to win a game because you're putting a bunch of people that are brand new and don't really know how to play against people who'm have been playing for quite awhile and know exactly how to play. It ruins the fun, if the team balancing was better, it would be a lot easier to have fun.  Not only this, but if you're playing alone and you join the match making queue, you get put into a game with two minutes left and the score is 0-5. 95% of the time the match making screws you over.
8948	0	a	The game its self it great, alot of fun. However the community surrounding the game is terrible. filled with players who only want to play in their teir and are unwilling to help new players get a feel for the game. Ive been around for alot of games to come and go on steam and this one wont last for long at all if the community keeps up with its hostility towards new players 
8949	0	a	This game is really fun...when you play with friends. The matchmaking in this game is ♥♥♥♥ poor. I hate playing online for this reason. When rookies and semi-pros are constantly being matched with veterans it makes the game unfair and unrewarding. Im not sure if this is a cross platform issue or what as I notice this happens more with PSYnet matchs. Until this is fixed I cannot reccomend this game unless you have friends to play with or you enjoy not winning a single match due to bad matchmaking.

8960	0	a	This is one of those games that is almost good, but is broken by some really poor choices by the developers. The idea is solid. Certain parts of the execution are solid. But then you start your first game and your friend drives straight into the soccer ball using boost. You didn't know about boost... or maybe you were a quarter of a second late to hit the button yourself. Your friend hits the ball first. It flies up into the air above your head. It goes straight into your goal. You have no chance to do anything about it. And you can try the stupid jump button to put your car in the air, except that it doesn't jump high enough to be worth it, and it is difficult to reorient after jumping.  Why does the ball love to go so high in the air? It is unreasonable and does not work with the driving controls. Also, to turn around, they want you to jump in the air and reorient? That takes 5 hours and is disorienting. Why are there no e-brake/J turns?  Why does the ball travel so far? It is huge. There is no way that physics would work like this in real life.  You might think that I'm just complaining about the game being difficult, and you might think 'but it's difficult for both sides so that doesn't matter.' But I would say that it's not the difficulty that is the issue. It is the lack of playability and the lack of being able to adapt to the situation after you mess up a play.  Additionally, playing with people+bots vs people+bots, the bots are so bad that my own teammates drive the ball back to our own goal and have set it up for the enemy. They have also ruined nearly every potential-goal-scoring play by moving the ball out of the range of the enemy goal right as I am about to score. If you play this game, which is bad enough as it is, make sure not to add any bots into the mix. They will make everything much worse.

8978	0	a	Please sort out controller recognition, been broken for ages.
8979	0	a	The barrier of entry for this game is a IQ that rivals that of human potatoes. If you pass this simple task you're on your way to becoming the next pro level Rocket League player. Get ready for 'fun' bounces that will have both you and your opponent asking yourselves 'Why am I playing this horrible excuse for a game?'
8980	0	a	This game is horrible. Super-laggy, not fun at all, no keys ever work, nor are there updates to help the lag. Bye, Psyonix.

8986	0	a	I thought this game was rather boring with only one gamemode, but different map and car appearances. I've asked Steam many times if I could refund this game, but they never let me. I don't know why, I just want my money back it's not a fun game.
8987	0	a	What can I say. The game has great graphics, good core gameplay, a sound concept and a good execution. It's a good game, or so you think.  It is the only game that makes me want to throw my PC out of a window and jump on it until there's nothing left.  There are three ways to play the game, with AI which only understands the ability to chase a ball and jump and hit it, with local players on splitscreen which leads to graphic glitches and with humans on PC or PS4 online.  The AI, as I've said, is thicker than the earth's mantle layer and will own goal at will. Because the matchmaking is horrific since the addition of the option to disable cross-play, finding someone to fill in the places on a doubles, standard or chaos match will be impossible forcing you to team up with the AI. While I'm there, the option to disable cross-play has lead to the ghettoisation of the online servers. While originally there were plenty of servers will many people available to play, once you get to a server with no PC team mate, you're stuck there for good.  Fun fact, I once waited half an hour in the pre-match waiting screen with no one else because the matchmaking is broken.  That's before I get to humans! The player base is the most vitriolic, toxic player base I've ever come across, and I used to play games on the Xbox 360 system! You make a mistake such as timing your move wrong, or you misjudge where the ball lands and you're branded as 'noob', 'f***tard', 'easy' or something else. And if you're lucky enough to have a human team 'mate', they'll brand you with just the same amount of silly vitriol, perhaps more.  The game servers are better than they used to be, but are still horrific. You could be stable at 40-50 ping then suddenly because someone else on the same broadband internet connection opens up a web page you go to 800 ping and start rubber-banding more than flubber. Not everyone has Fibre To The Property broadband and lives in the likes of London, New York, San Francisco, Singapore, Paris, Berlin or wherever the fastest internet connections are.  If I have fun, it's for a handful of minutes, then at that stage, it's gone and I feel like I need to start hitting someone.  This game was made for E-Sports, but I hate the concept of E-Sports. There's no sportsmanship, there's no fun, it's serious twitch reactions, something that video games seriously need to excise.
8988	0	a	its not for windows 7 because it constantly crashes, even when i have it on the lowest settings :(
8989	0	a	I don't know whats up with it, but I can barely run this game. Must be that my computer doesn't like this game, because I can literally run any other game.
8990	0	a	Sure, a fun game to play every once in a while. But it's very limited to 'hit the ball'. Other than that you can fly in the air and... And you can hit the ball. That's all you can do really.   There are 3 or 4 maps to play on, they're exactly the same but with another setting/sounds so basically nothing is different; every game is the same.   Costumisations are limited, just 4 or 5 pre-set stickers per car. Every car has the same theme stickers with a different pattern. You can put a hat on that will only match with one of your colors, or add an antenna that are mostly sponsors and just an eyesore on your vehicle.  If you aren't looking for a game that feels the same every single time and you'd like some depth in the gameplay, then skip this one. If you wanna have some fun because you're bored every once in a while then go for it, it's the only reason why I play it.  So recommended for 1 player? No.  2 players? Maybe.  3 players? Yea probably.  Buy this game when it's for sale since it's not worth the normal price.
8991	0	a	I really wanted to like this game, believe me. As a fan of weird football games Fifa Street, Haxball, some other game that was released in early 2000's... I put countless hours into them even though they weren't pretty good. This game, has so much promise, it got sexy moves, uniqueness, good customization and endless variety of play. It all could matter something if the game had some decent camera controls, or simply just an overhead cam that has been apparent in every football game ever made. Unfortunately, at this state of camera, I am given two options 'Know where you are' and 'Know where the ball is' there is no middle ground. Thus it makes the game unplayable for me. Other matter is matchmaking. I have started playing the game two days ago and I am matched with people flying all over the pitch and I am looking at them thinking 'what the actual ♥♥♥♥'.  When camera is fixed (if they even bother, seems like most of the people are fine with the game) I'll come back to it and play the ♥♥♥♥ out of it. Until then, no recommendation from me.  Edit: I don't know why every negative review about this game is downvoted to hell. All the negative reviews I've read were talking about the same points, surely pointing out that there is something to fix.
8992	0	a	Please stop with all the DLC, you are ruining the game. At least include the new stuff if you have to make new cars... its annoying to have to pay to have all types of paints and ♥♥♥♥... i mean, come on, i paid 20 ♥♥♥♥ing dollars for this small car soccer game, at least give me what i ♥♥♥♥ing paid for... i hate dlc...
8993	0	a	fix the ♥♥♥♥ing ranking system bronze 2 im a ''pro'' rank and all i verse are experts and vets like why how ♥♥♥♥ing stupid.
8994	0	a	Not in its CURRENT STATE! Fix the server issues BEFORE you release DLC! DO NOT SUPPORT UNTILL THEY FIX THIS!
8995	0	a	More luck involved than any cardgame out there.
8996	0	a	This game is fun but now it’s more like WAS fun.   The reason I'm writing a bad review is because I keep getting disconnected from every online match. The cause isnt from my side because I have no problems in any other game, my internet speeds/connections are solid, and other people are having the same issues as well. Hopefully the devs will fix this issue but until then I do not recommend people buying a game with crappy servers.   It was fun when it actually worked but for the past week I have not been able to play this game.   Edit: I also forgot to mention that the game will randomly slow down to 10-20 fps for no reason even on high spec computers. This problem is also well known.   What’s the point of paying for a game you can’t even play?
8997	0	a	* AUTISM SIMULATOR 2015 CONFIRMED *  When you thought that so called 'competitive' games could not be anymore overrated,autistic and stripped of basic game mechanics that had already been a standard in most games. This game is as competitive as SJW equality as it can get.  It's a fun game with excellent graphics,music and sound but terrible gameplay mechanics,physics and game design. If you are part of the autistic CS:GO community then this is the right game for you.  This game does not require any skills to do anything because 50% of the time the ball lands in the goal in the first 10 seconds of the match due to the fact that the developers cannot properly implement a proper physics for the ball and as well as the cars so the entire game is just completely random as hell.  The ball has absolutely no friction and doesn't even bounce like an actual soccer ball and simply bounces around like a beach ball more than anything and takes almost an entire 30 seconds to lose momentum and the ball doesn't even bounce in the correct direction even if you do a perfect direct hit when it is directly on the ground it simply bounces in a random direction instead of bouncing where you want it to go.  I find it hard to believe that these developers/employees managed to be certified for any video game degree seeing as how I slightly tap the ball and it simply continues to roll forward non-stop without showing any signs of gravity or friction and simply rolls it way into the goal and any slight change in course accelerates it's speed in the same direction. I think that either the developers did this deliberately to prevent pro-players and to cater to casuals or the developers are just bad with programming basic video game physics within the Unreal Engine.  I will not be surprised if I were to develope a clone of this game and actually improve what the game is seriously lacking. The game has no HUD to see your team mates booster meter and their charge rate as well as the fact that the game has no speedometer so there in no way of knowing how fast you are driving and it is impossible to do teamwork without the use of voice chat.  Like I have said earlier before it is a fun game but bad game design and physics. I am afraid this game cannot get anymore casual as it already is. It's game like these that their sole intention is to be as lazy as possible with their game deisgn and smack a bunch of graphics on it.
8998	0	a	The ranking system is horrible, matches you against pros and veterans straigt away regardless of your level or rank points. The keyboard controls are also among the ♥♥♥♥♥iest I've seen. As long as these problems exist, don't bother. 
8999	0	a	This game would be fun if it werent for the 90% of the playerbase that constantly troll, quit, talk crap, join the enemy team.
9000	0	a	Pros: Fun with friends.  Cons:  Camera angles, why is it not just a straight chase cam.  Griefers, ragers, and all around jack@sses. The random games are rediculous. At least a third of the games have some sort of griefer, rager, or just AFK this includes ranked matches.  Ranking system is a total joke 4 games in a row with AFK players or griefers (2 person) dropped my rating 30+ pts. And if they (AFK) gets kicked, you only can abandon the match which locks you out of multiplayer for 15mins.   I enjoy playing when it's not for these issuses. But 1/3 is too much to recommend this game. If they added a kick option it would solve the majority of these problems.  Matchmaking should have lobbies so you at least know what you are dealing with.
9001	0	a	fantastic even ****ing matchmaking system 0/10
9002	0	a	It's just too delayed and laggy in gameplay for me to even be able to play it, I do not recommend it.
9003	0	a	This is my personal opinion mixed with a bit of fact. The game is difficult, for sure. I don't know if it's just me, but control wise, it can be hard to get a handle on. I don't mind this too much, it just takes a long time to get used to. The thing that gets me about this game and the reason I don't play it, is the community and people who play it. I'm not too good at the game just about every game I play, that's all I hear. 'LOL LOOK AT THE SCORE, YOU GUYS SUCK ♥♥♥♥' and the likes, as if it's a bunch of CoD 12 year olds. That being said, I simply don't play the game anymore. It's not because I 'can't take an insult', but more so that I don't like playing with immature kids. Not to mention that the DLC cars have better hit boxes or some ♥♥♥♥ like that.  To be quite honest, this game is like poker. Based off of luck, it seems. Especially with your connection. If you don't have tard low ping, you're pretty much screwed, so keep that in mind if you wish to purchase this game.  Additionally, the ranking system is terrible. Maybe this is what causes my troubles, but from my first online match, I was up against Veterans and not too long after, Experts. Sure, throw me into the fray to learn, but I get fed up with constantly being rolled and don't have much of a chance to learn.  Hope you like spam, too.  + Cool gameplay mechanics  + Graphically appealing  + Fun with friends  - Ranking system terrible  - Absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥ community and players  - You have to pay for good cars
9004	0	a	Matchmaking is horrible. It's not uncommon to to a solo unranked game and to go up against 2 pros and a semi-pro when you have 2 rookies and a semi-pro. It's fun if you play with groups or friends, but until they fix the crappy matchmaking then it's only frustrating.
9005	0	a	this game is great but i allways get disconnected from match like i lost my conneciton even that my net is fine
9006	0	a	The game is alright, but the devs aren't helpful at all. This game is a lot of fun, don't get me wrong, but it has a lot of performance issues on a lot of computers. I have a decent computer, which should be able to run the game easily at 60+ fps, yet I get a lot of FPS spikes at 5 FPS, which makes the game unplayable. This is where the negative thing comes in: After having tried everything I know (running tests, changing settings for GPU, updating/downgrading drivers etc), I wrote a mail to Physx with logs and the problem and asked for help to be able to continue playing the game. Now, after numerous mails and more than a month later, I still don't have a single answer. The publishers got my money and don't care.  TLDR; Game is alright, but if you have a question, don't expect help in any way.
9007	0	a	If you hate racing games and hate sports games, this is both of them together. Have fun.
9008	0	a	Doesn't support Xbox One controllers as game pads, will make review thumbs up when patched.
9009	0	a	Why the negative review ? Some will say it's because i'm raging over this game. It's part true because this is the game the most frustrative game i've played this year and by frustrating i don't mean the positive sense.  If i play on an unranked 1v1 game i win right off the bat. Then if i start a ranked 1v1 game it should be, if not easy, kind of challenging. But no i find me against with people who do aerials to goal and other stuff rather hard for my level. So yeah i'd say it's okay if you have the starting 50 points. But when you're found with 0 points with a dude who keeps doing aerial against you.  I won't go over the ping issues as they are issued in the other review.  I know this review will have many poeple not in agreement with me and won't be on the helpful tab. But remember that if you really want to have fun don't play on ranked alone if you're not ready and be sure to have a friend because this game feel hollow without friends.
9010	0	a	Don't bother with this game anymore. I've been a Rocket League supporter for a long time, and the community is now so toxic that I won't even play unless I'm with friends, The 'random' (see below) people that you get matched with are universally rude that they will make you wish you hadn't even bothered launching the game. No one is willing to do anything about this either, so it will continue to ruin the game forever.  The random match-making is also insanely broken. Almost every single time I play I get matched up against some expert that has 6 goals and his two teammates have exactly 0 points for the entire match and we lose 6-5. It's a complete waste of time. Unless this gets fixed, I'm done.
9011	0	a	Dont buy this game, it's way overpriced for a crappy game. About 5 bucks worth of content.
9012	0	a	Match making is terrible. Constantly be put up against a full group of Pro level team, while my team is a bunch of solo playing Rookie levels. Probably is fun if you have a group of friends to play together, playing alone this game just isn't fun... unless you enjoy off balance teams.
9013	0	a	i bought the game, for the first few hours everything was fine, now i can't even get into a game without having a ping of 300+ and rubber banding everywhere. overally great game, horrible servers, i'll recommend after you fix the lag problem
9014	0	a	Takes a lot of practice to get good at this game. It's a tall learning curve. The only problem and it's a huge one is you don't get to play the maps you want. You are forced to play boring and frustrating maps along with the good ones. WIth each update this game becomes a game you want to play less and less. You will find it tough to play at first and a bigger dissapointment down the road. I would have to advice against buying it at this time. It's a big let down.
9015	0	a	dont buy this game...... this game has best servers with 200 or 100 ping...best physics also
9016	0	a	If you suck like me at sport or soccer games, then this game isn't for you. I have wasted away a portion of my life playing this game and it's painfully stressful and addicting which led me to uninstalling. When you get to lvl 20 which comes with time played even if you are a noob or suck you get the status of 'PRO' and will get matched up with the majority of other pros who do the same trick of hitting the ball to the side, over the head and around for the goal. All the experienced players do this crap over and over again and I just so happen to be unable to do it for the life of me. I can lose 20 games in a role on ranked 1v1 and still get matched up with pros who shoot with pinpoint accuracy. The MMR is completely jacked up to the point where gone are the days where I see rookie's make mistakes but am paired up with godlike players even when losing the majority of my games over and over cause apparently the MMR still doesn't think I suck enough to play with players my level.
9017	0	a	One of the worst games to play casually ever. Do not buy. Don't let the memes take your money.
9018	0	a	honestly liked at it first. until I realized the most dumb care into a game I ever seen. Getitng matched with people 3 times my rank and my team has all rookies and semi pros? gimme a break man...plus the AI in season mode is the worst I ever seen. Not impressed
9019	0	a	Some of the mechanics dont make any sense at all, like ball cam making it look like you're going to hit it, but all of the sudden you go right under/to the side/over the ball. Getting the ball pushed past you even though you're going max speed and the other person is barely moving the ball. Good game, frustrating nonsensical mechanics kill it.  TL;DR Stupid ♥♥♥♥ makes this game not fun.
9020	0	a	This game is really fun, runs really well and looks good. I’ve no issue with any of the gameplay only the way the camera works.  You have two modes one where the camera locks onto the ball and follows it, this will work fine for a while but you will get disoriented quickly and it makes it harder to line up shots due to the car facing the wrong way. The other mode is with the camera facing forward with the control on the joypad, this is fine if you’re used to it but for someone (like myself) that really does not use a controller will struggle. This game has been released for pc so you’d think it must have some competent keyboard and mouse support, no it does not, you can try binding your mouse to the camera controls in the game but they are clearly designed only for a controller. If you're expecting a competent PC game with Keyboard and mouse support this is not that, in my opinion it is missing the basics for a PC game.  
9021	0	a	One Word: Trash
9022	0	a	I CANT EVEN GET ON THE GAME BC OF THE NOT LOGGED ON PROBLEM IM UNISTALLING AND NEVER PLAYING AGAIN U BETTER FARTING FIX THIS OR U LOST A GOOD CUSTOMER

9025	0	a	at first it was ok its a fun game but now i get only disconnects and lag lag lag paid DLC ? a NO NO from me i want my money back  after 6 months ♥♥♥♥ matchmaking, ♥♥♥♥ game! I WANT MY MONEY BACK!
9026	0	a	Devs thought Wasteland map was a good idea in ranked. See you at the next oval-shaped superbowl.
9027	0	a	You would like it if you are 5 years old.
9028	0	a	The ranking system is pretty bad. They include grouped and ungrouped teams together. So people can group up with friends, or just good players they find and play in ladder and always win. Suddenly they are considered good, and gain ranks because they stacked their team. Meanwhile a bunch of players play ungrouped for whatever reason, meaning they are randomly put on teams, and end up with an uncoordinated or bad team sometimes, lose a match, and are considered bad.   What makes facing a grouped team really bad is that the skill doesn't scale well. So you will have a grouped team full of Challenger level players, and an ungrouped team full of prospects, and they consider that a fair matching? What a joke. Ultimately a rank system based solely on wins in a team game, is the dumbest idea ever, so is combining grouped and ungrouped.   You want to have a three player team, then make a guild, have 30 players in your named guild, and go in a grouped ladder only. Where it is group vs group. My 20 guild players against your 20 guild players. Ungrouped should be ungrouped for all.   Not only that they are adding a batman DLC car. Screw batman. Tron cars are what should be added. They have their priorities all backwards. Considering that one person ever, had a batman car, and his name was batman, when you include a batman car in a game, where 100,000 people can have it, it loses all meaning. It's useless. Who cares? At least tron cars look cooler.  All this aside I have played a total of 10 hours on rocket league, and the game is boring already. And I am definitely a fan of this type of genre of game. It's just really boring, repetative, and I don't know why people are saying it has a steep learning curve? A steep learning curve of playing one day straight for 8 hours maybe. After that you know how to shoot, fly in the air and do aerial hits and score on net etc. Collecting items is not an incentive to keep playing, it's actually really boring and doesn't keep me excited to play the game. It's not even true customization where you can make your own designs, hence its boring. Add guilds or something.  I wouldn't recommend this game, unless the ranking system changes and there is a tron car, and in game music can be played during a match and not just in lobby, and when guild creation is added. But ultimately until then, I'd only recommend this game if it was $10 or less. As in without fixing the matchmaking (the whole purpose of multiplayer unless you are casual gamer) and without squad/guild creation the game is not worth more than $10. It's still a very good game otherwise.   Keep in mind that at least 50% of the 2000+ negative reviews for Rocket League are raging about matchmaking. I actually broke it down and explained the issues.
9029	0	a	It's a well-made game, and was very fun at first. It's a pity it ceased to be fun shortly after the hour limit on getting a refund.
9030	0	a	Ok, the game itself is incredibly fun - if it works - but it's flat out broken. There is a bug that some users are having that will completely freeze the entire machine forcing us to hard restart the PC - there are dozens of posts and threads about this issue on Psyonix website - all users have different hardware, different CPUs, different GPUs, etc, so it's not caused by any specific piece of hardware. We have tried literally everything - from lowering settings, different windowed modes, upgrading power supplies, locking FPS, disbaling CPU cores, deleting and re-installing, updating drivers - nothing makes any difference. There is a bug in Rocket League that is crashing not just the game, but users entire PCs - posts about this issue dating back to July and Psyonix has not even so much as responded ONCE or even acknowledged the issue. Too busy raking in the cash to worry about the little guy that got you there in the first place, it seems. Take your money elsewhere.
9031	0	a	It's a well-made game, and was very fun at first. It's a pity it ceased to be fun shortly after the hour limit on getting a refund.
9032	0	a	This game is absolutely shocking.. Especially the 1v1 community. They wait for you to go for the ball first then they respond with a free goal... They will do anything for a win.. game NOT FUN EDIT: FULL OF GOALIE CAMPERS. BAD GAME
9033	0	a	Game is for QB's. Devs aren't good at making games. Wow.
9034	0	a	I love the game I really do. But when you say you are releasing a dlc and its still not out on the day of so called release thats when this game is ♥♥♥♥. I love all the stuff you release but why tell people a release date if you dont plan on releasing it on that day. You put your upcoming dlc that doesnt come out for another week on here before you put the dlc for today. Stop making games and focus on learning on to keep track of days and time.
9035	0	a	full of people who have no life if you are just looking for some fun definitely do not buy this i warn you.
9036	0	a	I recommended this game at first but now it is just a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t game which gets boring after 10 minutes. The ball physics are getting worse after each update and as of now, the ball does not even hit my car to be bounced away. its like you drive an invisible box with a car skin. The bots are useless too. When playing 2vs2, its actually 1vs3 because your bot will ram you, and make own goals. Good luck with this crap, because youre probably going to buy it anyway, because steam says very positive.
9037	0	a	Xbox One Controller not working STILL. The games been out how long? Still no fix?  I've tried all guides on youtube, forums, etc and nothing works.   
9038	0	a	I cant play this ♥♥♥♥ing game couse i lagg like ♥♥♥♥ with 256mb internet! GG! Thank you ! Want my money back!
9039	0	a	I cannot recommend buying this game at all.  The game itself is fun. While the idea of chasing a ball with a rocket-powered car is not all that original, the game is still so much fun to play. The things that I utterly despise about this game are its community on one hand, and the match making algorithms on the other hand.  Let's talk about the community first: Of course you stumble upon nice and charismatic people from time to time, who just want to have fun and enjoy the game, but most of the time you have to deal with a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s commenting on every little mistake that humans tend to make from time to time, including myself and the friends I play this game with. Another thing one comes across almost as often as those comments is arrogant behavior and the constant urge to show you how much better they are at this game. This might be true in some cases, but that doesn't mean that I'd like to hear about that after every goal you score, even if it's not even 'THAT' great or even just complete luck. People in this game are ignorant as f'ck, so if you want to enjoy online matches, you have to mute just about everyone.  Then, there's the matchmaking. I have currently played this game for about 130h, and the people I like to play with most of the time have not that much more (up to 300). One might think that, most of the time, we should be facing players with about the same amount, depending on our current run maybe even less, since there are days on which you just suck. What really happens all the time is one of two things: 1.) We actually face players who are about as good as we are. In most cases we take the lead, which results in our opponents quitting as soon as they're two to three goals behind, which is a thing we've never done once, no matter what. 2.) Our opponents have played Rocket League for about 200+ hours more than we have done. And this is the case 90% of the time, which is absolutely ridiculous. As I said, we don't like to quit, so we had to suffer more losses in the past few weeks than we actually won. Normally, the opponents that we'd get should be not that far off from us, but it doesn't change at all.  Even worse is the fact that, after we lost a game and decide to look for another match-up, this piece of ♥♥♥♥ of an algorithm always tries to throw us back on the exact same server and make us face the exact same guys we just lost 0-7 against. Again and again - which is complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.  I might continue to play this game, because it's really fun if you're facing people on about the same skill level, but I won't recommend starting to play this, because you might end up hating humanity if you bother reading what your opponents are saying or you might get your ♥♥♥ whooped over and over again because there's no way Rocket League is going to let you face opponents who are actually not 10-15 levels above you. 
9040	0	a	Fun at first, until you run into countless times where the server kicks you from ranked games and you lose you hard earned points. Pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ system that theres no way to rejoin a game.
9041	0	a	This game is a very popular one among its kind. But there is only one reason behind, its publicity. There is no other reason for this game to be this popular. For instance, there is a game called Zero Gear which is a beautiful game with several modes of gameplay and many people do not know what it is. At this point we see the importance of introduction of a game and its publicity and promotions.   First of all, it has terrible angles. Either you are able to see the ball or where you go. You can not drive according to your purpose. What is more, this is not a very difficult arrangement for a game. There are many different games in different types has more useful angles and driving experiences.   Secondly, this game has only one type of play, which is football. There is no racing, no chasing or capturing anything... After a while you get bored this game type and quit the game. It requires more game modes. As I mentioned before, Zero Gear has many different modes including basketball, racing, hockey, sumo etc. And it is much more amusing than this game.   On the other hand, it has many many customize options, and they are unlocked after every game you played, which is good. This make you play more and increases the pleasure. You may see very absurd cars while playing and you are able to create a very unique car for yourself.   Yet, the customizing options does not vary the abilities of cars. When you put thicker tyres, you do not gather speed faster than any other players. Or when you changed your car with more musle looking one, your car does not become stronger. There changes are for only appearance. If this upgrades are run in, it would be more complicated and depends more on tactics more than ability to drive. Right now, it is only a drive through game.  Finally, the price of this game is reasonable we can say. It is not too cheap but it is low enough to buy and play. Of course in sales it would be more cheaper, but you may not want to wait until the sales time if you really wish to play. Again comparing with Zero Gear, this game has much higher price, Zero Gear is for only $1 or something, so it is a shame that people are not playing it.   For overall, I think this game needs some repair and extra modes. So right now I do not recommend but if you are interested in this kind of game, you probably buy and play. So have a fun anyway.
9042	0	a	Only fun if you have real life friends to play with. Other than that Same old same old. Same maps, same map type, same game mode, same objective, same same same. We need something different in this game. Either new map styles, game modes, just something that is exiting to play that you can do instead of the standard math type.
9043	0	a	So after a few hours playing this game and thoroughly enjoying it i've deciding highly against giving it a positive review. The game is amazing dont get me wrong, hours of fun but ONLY and strictly ONLY in multiplayer. AI in this game is so ridiculous at any movement or shot taken they rarely screw up. It extremely off putting for people like myself trying to learn the game solo. Overall the AI just needs a massive revamp to make it less obsurd in its manouvering and skill level.  Dont buy if looking for single player experience.
9044	0	a	win 4 games ranked in a row, get matched with top playet, lose 4 games in a row. repeat 40 times. you have rocket league ranking. don't forgot the times when you have 800 MS for no reason
9045	0	a	Okay, I feel really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ now.  I, as a group's only PC gamer, bought this game for PC, thinking I could play with my friends who use PS4, since 'Cross-Platform Multiplayer' is advertised in multiple places, including the list of main features here in the store.  Boy, was I wrong. Excuse my french, but what the f*ck should I care what kind of hardware the other players use? As a player I only care that I can connect and play with my friends, who are on a different platform, which Cross-Platform implies, which you developers surely realize as you placed such emphasis on team play.  I'm really glad I didn't waste my money on the DLC cars, because why would I care what total strangers think of my car? Because, again, I can't play this game with any of my friends.  Great game and all, but to whoever's responsible for advertising this as cross-platform: Please, go take a deep breath in a pool.
9046	0	a	If you like multiplayer games and working as a team, that really isn't a team because you're assigned a new one each game, then you might like this game. If you get annoyed by whiny ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, you won't like this game. There are many of those.
9047	0	a	While this game is a really fun multiplayer game, especially when playing alongside friends, the game is too unstable for me to enjoy properly. A current issue I'm experiencing is reoccuring rubberbanding at the start of every match, no matter the server or game, ranked, official or private match. A bit of digging turns up a lot of other people having various rubberbanding and lag issues as well.  If you're able to enjoy the game without these issues, it is a fun and challenging experience that rewards both individual skill as well as co-ordinated teamwork. The physics are a bit cartoony, but that seems to be somewhat of an artistic decision.  When I'm able to play it, it's a lot of fun. However, the issues I'm having with the game is really frustrating, and often disrupts what is otherwise a fun gaming session. A pity, really. I do hope they patch the game up right quick.
9048	0	a	shocking game that ive played
9049	0	a	This game is supporting console gaming and those dumb console clans such as FaZe, OpTiC and MLG, no PC gamer wants them to infect PC gaming I give this idiotic game a 4/10

9051	0	a	Broken Game, I played 5 games on 15-20 ping, I should have won 3 of those games however the 'ball' glitched through my car and didn't go anywhere...once this gets fixed i would reccomend it to people but the way it is now, you shouldn't be charging for it.
9052	0	a	People say it isn't a sports game or a racing game. I say it's both, and only the things I like least about both, but if you like those types of games, I definitely recommend it
9053	0	a	Really buggy, lots of rubberbanding issue, Sad, the game was is pretty good otherwise, but it makes it unplayable Don't waste your money, unless it's something like 75% off

9057	0	a	Gameplay: 8/10 Servers: 1/10  This game is fun and original. But I can't enjoy it while having 200+ ping.I'm in ASIA. and Yes, the lag is real here in Asia. Hoping for an upgrade or a fix for this one.   P.S Recommended if u play with friends which is very fun and exciting.
9058	0	a	Not fun, just frusterating hopefully i can get a refund.

9060	0	a	This game should be free for how boring it is.
9061	0	a	This game has terrible servers. I tried to play a few matches of the game, but I couldn't do anything. It's not that I didn't understand how the game works, its just that I kept rubber banding all around the arena. I beleive that unless you are in the city that the servers are located, you will be unable to play this game. I repeat DO NOT BUY!
9062	0	a	Fun game, but the community is toxic to the point where most days it's not worth playing. Especially considering there's no way to report players. If you're hesitant, hold back.

9071	0	a	It's a good game, don't get me wrong. It's fun at the very least. That being said, 20$ is a lot for what is essentially 'soccer cars'.   If you can get past the price tag you're met with dlc and while it's not expensive and completely cosmetic, there's a lot of it which adds up and it started coming out almost as soon as the game was released. I don't mind cosmetic dlc but if your game is brand new and you have lots of DLC almost as soon as your game is released it looks and feels like a baltant cash grab. People talk about 'supporting psyonix' by purchasing the DLC but as a player whose already paid for the game I don't really feel that I owe Psyonix anything more. This isn't a patrion campaign, it's a computer game.   If you can get past the price tag and paid dlc and into the wold of playing against people, get ready to be called a '♥♥♥♥♥♥' and a '♥♥♥♥♥♥' and told to 'kill yourself' in 5 out of every 6 games. And that's not a creative estimate. The community you find while playing Rocket League is in no uncertain terms, awful, aggressive, and offensive. Sometimes you'll meet someone who is friendly or at the very least won't go out of their way to try to ruin your day but those people are few and far between. Nobody should have to put up with that. I play a lot of CS:GO and I've been called worse things on a greater frequency in Rocket League than I ever have playing CS:GO and CS:GO has a reputation for having a 'toxic' community. There's no report function and while you DO have the ability to play with communication off, you're still playing against those same people and if you can't talk to people what's the point? You're pretty much playing bots at that point.   After putting in way more time into this game than I should have I uninstalled it. I can deal with the price and the DLC but the community is really what pushed me over the edge. The gameplay can be fun sometimes but the people just ruin it. If you get the game, you might have fun. Until you just get sick of getting ♥♥♥♥ on over and over again. Not worth it.
9072	0	a	At first it seems like a good game until you realize:  -ball physics suck  -too much nitro on the map -you get too highly rewarded for playing defensively -you are able to drive up the walls in the goal which does nothing but screws you over -you can get screwed over by the nitro spike (or whatever you wanna call it) -sometimes cars don´t get blown up/rammed away  and probably even more points i couldn´t quickly think of
9073	0	a	servers are doggo  devs are moneygrabbers  don't bother
9074	0	a	Very poorly optimized game, I normally average about 25 ping but while playing this game im lucky to go under 150
9075	0	a	This game has a good concept but unfortunately falls short of being great due to small but very annoying bugs that the dev team should have under control by now. I'm talking about cars getting stuck on the edge of the goal, ridiculously bad physics for anything collison-related, and generally laggy play, even when only the closest region is selected. Not to mention the 'ranking system' if you can even call it that. 'Cobbled together' would be a generous description of online play.  This game would be worth it for less than $10.
9076	0	a	This game cant matchmake atall
9077	0	a	It wouldnt be bad, infact it would be great if the ranking system was better. I have seen rookies against veterans.. to get to veteran you have to play ALOT. This simply is not fair and a main reason I will no longer play, as there is no point to play without a good multiplayer experience. If they can get it together and fix their VERY BAD ranking system, I might come back.

9082	0	a	There is absoluitely shocking amounts of server lag, if you are thinking of buying this game, do not... at least until they sort it out.  My ping is 26 (easily low enough) and my car slides all over the place with the disconnect symbol appearing.   TL:DR - DO NOT BUY until they sort the servers out.

9089	0	a	TL;DR If you live in China, don't buy this game... yet.  Before you pass, read this review, and it'll tell you why it's bad.  This is a good game, it really is. Not being a soccer fan at all whatsoever, I love this game because it combines both cars AND soccer AND rockets with explosions and fast speed. Yep, pretty exciting. The graphics are wonderful, the cosmetics are great, and this game is enjoyable - with or without dlc. Although this game is made for people with controllers, me personally not being a fan of the controller, still managed to play this game, and mastered its basics within the timeframe of 2 hours. Great, simple controls make everything easier to study.  So why am I giving this a bad review?  Because of the servers. Right now, I'm sure they're working on it, as Rocket League is somewhat fairly new. But in the place I live, in China, the servers can't connect for some strange reason - prehaps the government blocked it - but was able to connect to the servers through a VPN, which, still, gave me 200 ping and gradually incremented to 400 for no reason whatsoever even though the VPN is extremely fast.  Once the servers have been fixed, I'll be happily able to rewrite this review, and reconsider. For now, I guess I'll play offline...
9090	0	a	Playing this game is like getting anally probed by aliens; weird at first, then enjoyable, and by the end you hated it.  3/10 would return again to get back the $20 this game costs for some reason
9091	0	a	♥♥♥♥ game never play ranked u get paired with idiots and timer is broken plus everyone trolls
9092	0	a	It's the same exact game as Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket Powered Battlecars. I played that 6 years ago. It doesn't improve on that in any way that I can see. There's not much of a skill ceiling either. All you can do is play 5 minute matches with either 2, 4 , 8 or 10 players and unlock cosmetics as you play along, or play the singleplayer season where you also just play 5 minute games but against the computer. After 3 hours of gameplay I have seen everything this game has to offer. I just don't think there's enough content in this game to justify it's pricetag. At least the graphics are fairly pretty, and you can unlock the theme song from the original (kick-♥♥♥!) using the Konami code on the start screen.
9093	0	a	its really lagy i want my money back

9109	0	a	well... I bought it for a home lan party. Didn't like it. Placed 3rd.  # an small update, because I got 0% helpuful from my review: *) Game runs pretty smooth on my notebook on low/medium settings (i5-3317u / GT-640M / 6GB DDR3 / PCIe-SSD). *) Playing with the AI is totally boring. No real possibility to enjoy it solo. *) Jumping around feels strange for me. Boosting and jumping is also not really the type to play. *) Shooting from different angles to the goal is nearly impossible with jump-turn-hit. I was only able to get mid-possition.  Overall I don’t like the concept of driving a car in the same small arena and header it into the goal.

9111	0	a	I loved this game when it first came out. But after the new update to the ranking system I will no longer be playing it near as much, nor will I be recomending it to anyone for full price. If it is on sale then sure go ahead buy it, it will be worth the 5 bucks; but at $20 it is no longer worth it after this update. Because it was only an update they can always change it back, when they do I will put this game back to recomended.
9112	0	a	This game needs mouse support for camera... otherwise it's ♥♥♥♥ ranking system is also ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and servers are just randomly disconnecting ppl.. I am constantly on 0 points because of that ranking system and can't move on (and most of games I carry) either I have really bad luck on teammates or unless you have team full of pros and you bang newbies you won't get up in rank so it's not really solo friendly game (for ppl who doesn't have friends) - overall good game but buy it only in sale. and a BIG ONE.
9113	0	a	The ranked system is screwed. Play for fun sure but don't bother trying to compete
9114	0	a	I was really getting into this game but then after an update a couple weeks back it became unplayable.   Despite having a ping of around 30 myself and a friend get constant freezes and disconnects. At first i presumed they had stuffed something up and would quickly fix it but nope.. still no change and im starting to give up on it.
9115	0	a	if you're good enough at the game, you'll understand why play Doubles is like playing 1v2, teammate not found

9120	0	a	Hours of great fun, but fundamentally flawed by bad players bringing down your ranking. Why such unskilled players want to play ranked is also beyond me. The other issue is the matchmaking, where you could be paired with noobs but against all vets. I'd rather wait an hour for a game to preserve my rank. A better matchmaking system would be on stats instead of time played, as you can see there are numerous awful vets out there. Average goals and saves is far more important than duration of play. So many players couldn't hit a donkey's a$$ with a banjo. Shame, as the game had so much promise. I knew all the hype and amazing reviews couldn't be true, and I was right

9131	0	a	It may seem like i have very little reasoning to be disliking this game due to the amount of time i have on record, but its for a good reason. THIS GAME IS OVERRATED. The controls are, how do I describe it, 'clonky'. The only redeeming quality of this game is the concept. I praise this game's concept because it has executed something others could not achieve, making a physics-based car soocer video game. Also, the camera makes me queasy. I'm not hating the game, but I personally don't recommend it.

9137	0	a	I know most people on Steam really love this game and it is reflected where 94% of the user reviews recommend a purchase. I can see that this game is fun and original but after some time the novelty wears off. The first few games feel great and I can definitely see the appeal in them. But it just gets repetitive, with only one gamemode just altering in player counts. So you are paying £15 for one gamemode and nothing to work for. Don't get me wrong I can see the good in this game but it is worth £8 at most. Only buy this game if you have friends who love it.  PROS: -Fun Concept -Good To Play With Friends -Appeal -Colourful  CONS: -Repetitive -OVERPRICED (£15 for 1 Gamemode) -Nothing To Work For -1 Gamemode -Chaotic play when playing with lots of players -'Idiots Who Just Want To Hit The Ball (Not pass or anything) -Teamwork is not encouraged unless you playing with friends in voice chat
9138	0	a	Don't ♥♥♥♥ing buy this game. It's trash. You might as well ♥♥♥♥ing get zero gear. 10 times cheaper, 10 times better. ♥♥♥♥ playstation.
9139	0	a	A very good game with friends when playing casually, but...  ...still random crashing after over a year of release. I have to force reset my computer, as the game freezes my PC completely. I haven't experienced the problem with any other game so far.   The matchmaking is very bad and the community is the worst. The developers smell money and have started asking more for less (DLC). You can find crates that contain premium skins, but you'll have to pay to open them. If you don't pay, you can't sell/trade those crates either.

9146	0	a	This game is so bad, i could get 60 autistic kids and make a better game/server, better yet 60 blind autistic kids and make this game great again! Trump needs to fix the servers before i take my life. On the verge of killing of myself, also un installed, 44 ping but game keeps skipping, not my graphics card or anything.

9150	0	a	Don't ♥♥♥♥ing buy this game. It's trash. You might as well ♥♥♥♥ing get zero gear. 10 times cheaper, 10 times better. ♥♥♥♥ playstation.
9151	0	a	A very good game with friends when playing casually, but...  ...still random crashing after over a year of release. I have to force reset my computer, as the game freezes my PC completely. I haven't experienced the problem with any other game so far.   The matchmaking is very bad and the community is the worst. The developers smell money and have started asking more for less (DLC). You can find crates that contain premium skins, but you'll have to pay to open them. If you don't pay, you can't sell/trade those crates either.
9152	0	a	I know most people on Steam really love this game and it is reflected where 94% of the user reviews recommend a purchase. I can see that this game is fun and original but after some time the novelty wears off. The first few games feel great and I can definitely see the appeal in them. But it just gets repetitive, with only one gamemode just altering in player counts. So you are paying £15 for one gamemode and nothing to work for. Don't get me wrong I can see the good in this game but it is worth £8 at most. Only buy this game if you have friends who love it.  PROS: -Fun Concept -Good To Play With Friends -Appeal -Colourful  CONS: -Repetitive -OVERPRICED (£15 for 1 Gamemode) -Nothing To Work For -1 Gamemode -Chaotic play when playing with lots of players -'Idiots Who Just Want To Hit The Ball (Not pass or anything) -Teamwork is not encouraged unless you playing with friends in voice chat

9158	0	a	Although the Game is Good but Vrey laggy game cant play fix this lag rocket league this game if good this though i will give 5/10 and i wont recomend it because it lag af which make is unable to play
9159	0	a	I dont understand the love for this game. Its extremely difficult to control and seems to be dumb luck if you actually score. Sure I may suck at it, but just imagine trying to hit a ball into a net while driving a car, its not going to be an easy task, and in the end it just ends up being work. The best way I found to actually score is race to the centre at the start and try to lob it in; after that its dumb luck.
9160	0	a	No, stop. it gets stale and boring after a few hours. the DLC's and everything are just costumizable stuff, So basically you're just playing on the exact same map, the exact same gamemode, with different cars.   10/10 GOTY ♥♥♥♥ING COOL MAN SO GLAD I BOUGHT IT AND THE DLC'S CAN'T WAIT FOR IT TO BE TRAIN SIMULATOR AND HAVE AROUND 100 DLC'S.
9161	0	a	Sincronization Simulator 2015 just merged with Queue Simulator 2015!   Can't play this game since october because it keeps failing to find a server for me and constantly sincronizes when I leave the game.  Game is great, but I can't play it anymore.
9162	0	a	Probably the worst game I have ever played. Its fun at first but once you get use to the controls you realize the game is jsut 110% luck, that's all it is. Anyone who says different is delusional. Community is garbage, like most, it's full of obnoxious cretins who'll just spam the chat with insults.

9173	0	a	Seemingly unplayable on W10  I've put over 100 hours on this game across steam and PS4, and suddenly I can no longer play on steam. During the 60 hours I have on steam I played on max settings while watching Netflix on a second monitor. Today, I can't play the game on a single monitor with minimum settings without my resource useage spikeing so high that I get 0-2 FPS and my entire PC locks down. I don't understand why this is happening, and I've recieved little help in discovering the problem. So, either play on PS4 or don't get W10 I guess. The game itself it fun, and if you like it you're going to love it. The matches are so quick that you're largely free from frustration, yet they remain rewarding and engaging. Thumbs up if I could play still, but technical problems and a lack of support prohibit a positive review.

9177	0	a	Pro: really good game with a lot fun VS Con: Crossplaying with ps4 sucks and disabling the option doesn't do ♥♥♥♥. Also, double jumping high in the air is ♥♥♥♥ and I don't how the ♥♥♥♥ people do it after being in the air for so long. ♥♥♥♥ this game now, until they fix both of them.
9178	0	a	Plays a couple games... Sucks.... Gets matched against semi pros... gets my ♥♥♥ whopped...  I dont reccoment this game because, i cant even have fun or try. I get matched with people 20x my skill level, and i get ♥♥♥♥ on. SO DONT PLAY THIS GAME. You will never get to try to get good, because you get ♥♥♥♥ on by people way way better than you. so, DONT PLAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This game is so ♥♥♥♥♥♥.
9179	0	a	Once upon a time there was an amazing game called Rocket League. It was very fun and everyone enjoyed it, Then they added a crate system and decided to let the servers go to trash so the game was terrible. The end.
9180	0	a	Money wasted, increadably laggy!
9181	0	a	Was gifted this. Personally didn't like it but could see how it may appeal to some people. It suffers from 'meme' syndrome. Again, I can see how it may appeal to some, but it just isn't my thing. I don't care for 5 minute matches with quick games that boil down to who can bounce it off a wall first to set. It seems like other games such as HoTS were the game's match is made to be short, yet this is so short it feels like I accomplish nothing. Not to mention it essentially bashes me to use the controller. I've tried both KB+M and controller and it doesn't feel right with either. To give you an idea, its like Eurotruck Simulator with a controller. There's other problems but I'll leave it at that so I don't appear ungrateful. I have messaged them and okay'd the refund of the game. I am not recommending this at full price. If you are of a general audience then more than likely you would love it and probably not think twice paying for it in full.

9186	0	a	this game's ranking system is bad and anyone who tells you otherwise is just good at abusing it. no exceptions.
9187	0	a	This game is great. Buy it if you want fun. My gripe is the fact that some achievements are blocked behind a pay-wall and I feel that deserves a thumbs-down. Not as a suggestion that the game is horrible but to just dissuade others from hopping on this bandwagon of hiding achievements behind DLC. If you want 100% achievements, be prepared to purchase the DLC.
9188	0	a	Good game that got ruined by the lack of good camera settings... rather than give free camera that could be controlled with the mouse one is presented with two options and both of them are quite bad. Considering that it seems to be otherwise good game that got ruined by the camera I'd have to say that it has the worst camera in gaming (in my experience).  Camera aside, the game is quite alright. The reason I would not recommend it is because I am not much for on-line games anymore because I can't seem to get along with on-line communities, and I would recommend the game to some people, but not people of similar tastes as me.  The gameplay is good, you control a car and playing either solo or in team you need to get the ball into oposing teams goal. The off-line gameplay is alright but repetitive due to playing against bots that don't have much in their arsenal. I found the training to be most interesting aspect of off-line side of this game.  On-line is one of the more disappointing things for me. For every one nice person you meet there are a hundred of obnoxious types so at the end of it I just disabled all of the communication within game. The matches take only 5 minutes so in case the game is not going the way you want to you get a redo in just a few moments. Ranking matches are as always a bit off. I have found that matchmaking is quite good, but from what I could tell ranking is using some ELO-based system to award or remove points and it is still not a good system for individual ranking in team games. ELO-works on solo-duels or as a rank of a whole team, but not as individual ranking when playing in a team with other people.  That being said, I disliked more of the game than I liked. I would probably recommend this game to people who like grinding their own skill cap and don't mind the on-line community (I guess they could get used to the camera as well). The short matches in the game make bad games that much more beareable.
9189	0	a	Extremely buggy and some of the worst matchmaking I've ever seen
9190	0	a	Fun game and all, but if your game times me out why the ♥♥♥♥ should I get 15 minute penalty? Wasting my time, making me not wanting to play this game over stupid ♥♥♥♥. The game even shows me an error code when I get kicked? Is that my fault? No its the game's fault and the game's server.   Fix it
9191	0	a	Just seems to simple for me it was fun for a bit but it was boring to me... and laggy really laggy 6/10
9192	0	a	Game is good but the lag is some of the worst I have ever experience in a game before and the devs wil not address it or even try to fix it, They would rather create new maps and DLCs then fix their broken game.  DO NOT BUY
9193	0	a	IF YOU ARE IN EUROPE DO NOT BUY THIS GAME....EU SERVER WORKS *****....YOU WILL LOSE CONNECTION (NOT ONLY YOU, ALL THE PLAYERS OF THE 2 TEAMS IN THE MATCH) RANDOMLY. SO IF THE SERVER 'CRASH' WHILE YOU ARE IN A RANKING MATCH YOU WILL BE PUNISHED WITH 10 MIN OF COOLDOWN BEFORE ENTERING IN A NEW RANKING MATCH FOR 'LEAVING A RANKING MATCH'. IT WAS THE SERVER, NOT ME !!!! AND OBVIUSLY YOU WILL LOSE RANKING POINTS...IT HAPPENS IN EVERY GAME MODE WHEN PLAYING ON EU SERVERS....

9220	0	a	i think it is time to write a review of the best piece of ♥♥♥♥ game ever thati really love to play.  to start off the review i would like to say that the game is very well made and the devs have done a fantastic job.this game is very fun but because of the following reasons i just can't reccomend it for MOST people.  1.only european and american servers- it basically means that if u live anywhere else on the PLANET, well hahahah you're screwed my friend#300 ping life.But what if i just want to join private/local matches with my friend? well then screw you too because you will still be put in a european/american server.so basically endless lag and frustration.  2. close to no matchmaking-basically if your a noob your screwed  3. it becomes very repetitive and you find yourself waiting for '$3.99' dlc which don't really add much to the game.  4. singleplayer is really bad-the bots don't no what they are doing and tend to score own goals the majority of the game.  i rate 7/10-it is still a fun game at its core and i have alot of really fun moments but overall i can't recommend it for people who don't live in europe/america. 
9221	0	a	Fun game but there isn't enough to it for it to be worth £15
9222	0	a	This is a fun game.  But the community is an atrocity filled with trolls and asshats. Until there's a way to report the groups of sociopathic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s or the people who instantly leave games after 1 goal is scored on them, save yourself the stress.
9223	0	a	Local coop does not work i bought the game just because my little brother wanted it so i saw it was local coop and bought it but the local coop did not work so plz fix or go and ♥♥♥♥ yourselfs for making my little brother cry

(Note: I have uninstall and install the game to see if it works, and uninstalled and installed the ps3 controller drivers. Nothing Works)

9232	0	a	Worst game I've played this year. A complete waste of money, with very little to actually do. With worse matchmaking than Valve can mange. I bet the entire dev team are total dickless monkey ♥♥♥♥♥ as well.  The developers of this game is literally ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.
9233	0	a	buggier physics engine than goat simulator/10 basically does whatever the ♥♥♥♥ it wants also the worst MM system ive ever seen will match you with people 2-3 ranks above you regularly

9235	0	a	This game is very repetitive, at the beginning, it's fun, but after a while you just start to be in the same teams with rookies. That is plain boring and you pretty much have a 20% win rate, when you get over semi-pro lv.
9236	0	a	Terrible game, the ball goes through your car with instant times! Unplayable.
9237	0	a	Just worth $1.

9239	0	a	Buggy, laggy, bouncy (and not in the good way).
9240	0	a	no support for musterbating while playing. Game constantly requires both hands to play and there are no guides online for how to set up your key bindings to enable 1 handed play. Can not recomend until this is patched.
9241	0	a	Great game, got to play 5 games but only finished 1 before refunding.  Gameplay 8/10 Servers 1/5  
9242	0	a	This game takes no skill and your car is going to be upside down 70% of the time.
9243	0	a	Edit: I don't hate this game, from a design standpoint it is very high quality, and i still play with some friends. Just reporting some findings.  Matchmaking just bunch people together, regardless of 'skill level'. Too much inconsistency regarding collision and speed, a friend told me i 'just sucked'. So you end up with this disparity between 'semi-pro' and 'veteran' players. And this weird META. You have some controls on the mouse, but basic camera movement is nonexistant, i just rebinded them to keyboard and play with the left hand only. It is a game made for console casuals. Edit1:(an update added the same camera control console controllers have to keybind options, but still not mouse control, you can bind to the mouse but it just flicks your camera out of control.)  TL;DR: Buy this game if you like frustration about things outside your control.
9244	0	a	This game sucks! The ping is way too high. Like 7/10 people have 100+ ping and the PSY-users are even worse. They are stuttering and are teleporting across the map. Fix this and make dedicated servers for these f@gs.
9245	0	a	For some strange reason this game makes me so angry....I win a match and I'm like mildly entertained but when I make a stupid mistake or a teamate screws up amazingly I turn into the Hulk and just want to smash things in my computer room...and I'm normally a very patient guy.  I think this game, just like my experiences playing Trine with friends, turns me into an evil monster that wants to eat puppies.  Seriously, this game is like a drug, it's like alcohol...please play responsibly.  I decided to update this review to add some more experiences.  So clearly I'm still playing this game off and on because it is a legitimately good game, I would recommend single player to everyone but I still stand by my initial review, multiplayer just really doesn't seem worth it.  To be honest though I think my opinion is more about the state of the multiplayer community then the game in general...or maybe I'm just getting old and crotchety.  I want to update this again since they've added the new Rumble game mode. The game has continued to go down the exact same route and yet I still play it. Obviously the game is a well designed game but the new addition of rumble mode has added another feature to make the game frustrating due to pure RNG.
9246	0	a	Good game if you don't mind the microtransactions that were added in the latest patch.
9247	0	a	Game is fun but if it crashes you get ban'd for some lenght of time. Punishment for buying an unstable game I guess.
9248	0	a	I would give this a thumbs up it the AI didn't intentionally score on your own goal. One teamate leaves and you're down 2 extra goals right off the bat.
9249	0	a	This is just another overhyped indie game...
9250	0	a	THIS GAME IS E-SPORT??!?!?! IT ♥♥♥♥ING DOESN'T LET ME RECONNECT IF I GET KICKED OUT FOR WHATEVER REASON! HOW THE ♥♥♥♥ CAN'T LET YOU SOMEONE REJOIN IF HE GET'S DISCONNECTED OR HIS GAME CRASHES. LEARN SOMETHING FROM OTHER E-SPORTS GAMES! SUCKS
9251	0	a	Played on friends PS4.  Bought for PC  Crashed when I try to open a game. Every. Single. Time.  Conclusion. Buy a PS4 for the sole reason of this and Battlefront 3. Simple.  Edit: I know my computer is ♥♥♥♥, it is just that I wrote this for comedial purposes. But this is what I did.
9252	0	a	You try to touch balls, but then desync says you can't.

9255	0	a	Sometimes I wonder if some have the option 'disable skip'. This frustrate me alot and put me on a tilt making me lose games and sometimes I swear and get really angry. I have killed my dog and my wife has left me. Don't buy this game unless you can handle a game with nonskipping dorks. Loads of germans aswell, learn english maybe
9256	0	a	Great game but im not going to reccomend just because of the DLC hahahaha GETCHA GOTCHA ROCKET LEAGUEY

9259	0	a	Game is good, yes. But its matchmaking makes it unplayable. If you are not completely retаrded you get placed vs professionals. As rookie. And you get retаrded rookies in your team that you are supposed to carry, bиllshit.
9260	0	a	Fun game for a bit, not worth $20
9261	0	a	Fun game but the match making system really spoils it, if your playing on your own you will repeatedly get thrown into games that are half way through where your team is losing heavily, I'm going to avoid playing this until they either allow an option to disable this or they stop it entirely.
9262	0	a	So I have played around 85 hours and if you are planning to play this game mostly solo then I would suggest to play another game. Once you go into solo qeue then you either can´t someone decent or someone who doesn´t even know how his monitor works. Also a lot of this game is luck based skill isn´t needed it´s all luck. You can be 10/0 and then after 2 minutes you can be 10/25 just because the kick offs were shot by the other team and for some reason it changed directions into your goal and there is nothing you can do.
9263	0	a	With weird ballphysics, being super repetitive and a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ matchmaking, this game equals an old mans hairy, flabby and for 4 weeks unwashed ♥♥♥.
9264	0	a	Screw your servers
9265	0	a	♥♥♥♥ game don't buy.
9266	0	a	This game is stupid I thought it was about space ships.
9267	0	a	THIS GAME IS ♥♥♥♥. Its a amazing concept but the physics and the way the ball moves off the cars is so ♥♥♥♥ and the game is almost completely luck
9268	0	a	this is game is dead
9269	0	a	This is a good game in concept however it is very annoying to play with because its hard to get half decent graphics and a good framerate, and the motion blur kills everything. If you don't have emaculate internet speed (&gt;100) then you might as well not even bother playing and I am generally disappointed with the game after all the good feedback I've seen and heard. I would like to point out that I have a 2015 desktop gaming PC so it's not hardware that's the issue...
9270	0	a	Not very exciting, in my opinion. The developers make the game look good to everyone, but in reality the only people who play the game regularly and enjoy it are soccer/football players.
9271	0	a	Its hard if you are bad at soccer, or hate fast paced games. The screen moves fast on ball view, and is confusing on freeview.
9272	0	a	Cute Idea, but in any game where one has to rely on a combination of machinery and the whims of strangers in order to have fun, both will fail you every time. The machinery will fail because the onus of all machinery is failure. The strangers with whom youve been thrown in will fail you because they do not know you and you cannot physically harm them. Although it is a shame, I cannot feel remorse in giving this game a negative review, for although the team behind it is clearly tallented and has excecuted their idea superbly on a technical level, the concept around which the game was built is flawed to it's core.

9283	0	a	worst ranked system ever. u should be able to play some games and the game to define the rank you should be and put u there as most games with competitive or ranked matches do. but no in this game u just have to crawl up from bronze I for no reason and play against and with noobs all the time. how r u gonna win or be what u have to be if u have 2 people against u plus your own teammate against u cause he is a noob and he plays bad? do we only just have to boost ourselves with friends to the rank we deserve?...... sucks
9284	0	a	boring, due to poor matchmaking. fun to play with friends once a month for an 2 hours then you remember why it is ♥♥♥♥ trash game ♥♥♥♥ the police
9285	0	a	This game is like marijuana, its addictive but bad for your health. Why? cuz the match making system in this game gives you cancer. Even if you are a rookie player, you can still get matched up with pros and veterans. Not to mention, this game is a waste of money... just like marijuana
9286	0	a	The idea for this game is OK, but the execution is really lacking. The cars lack in speed and manouverability that limits a skilled player from playing better. The bounciness and the weight of the ball for official modes has to be tweaked, it always bounces higher than you can dash and the vehicle/ball interaction makes the gameplay very weird and frustrating.  I've played more than a couple of cours and unlike most other games where players improve overtime, in this game you actually get worse over time. Here's the reason: in the beginning all you do it point your nose and smash the ball, and like I mentioned above due to some luck and the fact that cars are limited in movement the ball gets into goal. You start to think that you are good/improving but as you attempt to play any other way (start using tactics) the ones who just point and smash into ball start winning over you. Again this game has to do more with whoever smashes into the ball first than actual skill. Cars and extra physics make it deterring for a player looking to play with skill. The controls and car movements could have been done better too. Overall - thumbs down.
9287	0	a	I was under the impression that this was a football simulator. Let me tell you, it is NOT!  This is an abomination of the beautiful sport of football, enjoyed by millions around the world and played by pro's such as Lionel Messi and Christiano Ronaldo (they are amazing)  BUT when I spent my $20.00 United States Dollars on this so called 'football simulator', I was rudely informed during the tutorial that I could not get out of the stupid rocket powered buggy, and to shoot a goal, I needed to drive in to an oversized football. How do you call this a game?  Cars are meant for driving to and from the stadium to watch soccer games, NOT to play soccer.  I have sent a request for a refund and will get all my cousins on the developers if they do not accept the refund.  GOOD DAY.  /s
9288	0	a	For babies
9289	0	a	They won't put this game 50% ....wtf
9290	0	a	This game is the most ♥♥♥♥ing fustrating game you cant do turn properly or do 360s and ♥♥♥♥ing who uses cars to play soccer. Now dont get me started with the matchmaking. Honestly full fo ♥♥♥♥tard rookies who are better than me when im a semi pro and then vsing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ pros and vets who think they are good because they hacked to get pro. This game costs 20 dollars like wtf it should be free whoever made this game is autistic and should really neck himself.
9291	0	a	Rocket League is very competitive, requires some skill. It takes some effort in the beginning, just to do the basic gameplay of the tutorial in a match with other people, how it is supposed to be done. While doing this, you will meet people with anger management problems, people who easily give up and leave or people who just put much more hours in the game than you do. You lose, either way. After this period of time, you finally understand how this game works, how the community works, if you want to battle both, investing a lot of time.  Well, I bought Rocket League for having fun. So I can't recommend this.
9292	0	a	Well. I don't know, I just can't get into it I guess. I bought this because of the eurogamer review and the first few hours of playing this were pretty fun. The game crashed once and only once I had server issues in 10+ hours of playing, so the the online mode is alright.  But for a competitive party game it's just too time consuming (which is probably a good thing for quite a few people). People say the game is easy to learn and hard to master, but I disagree. I had to watch a 20 minute long camera-angle-tutorial to even get a chance at hitting a bouncing ball. The ingame tutorial and the sandbox-mode are lackluster at best. The challenges are way too hard and boring to grind for beginners, so you have to watch another tutorial on how to practice properly with the few options the game gives you.  On the other hand, you can just jump into online-mode right away without knowing what you are doing and can have fun too and it worked for me for like 10 hours or something. On the highest level, this game is super fun I guess but getting there is just not worth my time...
9293	0	a	I bought this game after getting a few weeks of non-stop pressure and insistance that this game was fantastic. An hour in, it got old fast. I dont understand the appeal and I probably never will. There's only one mode of game with the only apparent reason to keep playing is either to collect hats. Even with friends this got old extremely fast. Paid $25 AUD for this game, a complete waste of money.
9294	0	a	This game is overhyped as ♥♥♥♥ and not even that good, I can give it a 3/10 barely. It has good graphics thou.
9295	0	a	How about we strap this game to a rocket, ROCKETS EXPLODE!
9296	0	a	Fun game dont get me wrong, but I just got banned for leaving a ranked match since I had to go to Chili's, thats s***. I PAYED 20.00$ FOR A GAME TO BAN ME FROM MATCHMAKING! FIX THIS
9297	0	a	Gets old really fast. Flavour of the month streamer-bait game, will probably die out soon honestly.   EDIT: Probably one of the worse fanbases ever, the game is flavour of the month ♥♥♥♥, downvoting negative (and extremely honest) comments doesn't stop that fact.  People are allowed to dislike things.
9298	0	a	Laggy servers, wonky physics, stale gameplay after 5 minutes.  Trashcan of a game, not worth the money.
9299	0	a	I'm sorry, I'm not making any exceptions to my rule. Micro-transactions are a true cancer to gaming society and until Psyonix learns to respect their fans and stop nickel and diming them, I'm no longer recommending this game. Its got good game design, its got good graphics, its music sucks but that's just me probably, and its simple but in-depth. There's nothing wrong with the game in terms of gameplay or anything but just the inclusion of having to earn crates and buying keys in order to open them is greedy and disrespectful to paying customers and I don't want anyone to support this game until they remove it but I doubt they will since they get special treatment, which is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. If Ubisoft and Payday 2 can't do it, I don't see how that doesn't apply here. I no longer trust Psyonix and unfortunately they will only continue to spread the cancer. Nothing is sacred anymore and I guess a world of micro-transactions is upon us since no one cares, sad really.
9300	0	a	Freddy Fish adventure was great  would play again on Hardcore mode  10/10 *EDITED*  Nevermind , don't buy this game , it will make you use your moms credit card to buy crates and keys for ♥♥♥♥♥♥ drops  Wellcome to Rocket Fortress Global League 3
9301	0	a	not good need a controller :( i refunded the game dun buy unless u hav a controller
9302	0	a	This game feels like a hotwheels game for babbies. Tons of games have done this gameplay before and never got noticed. This is just more mainstream junk that got popular from twitch and youtube. Like minecraft or ark. I really wish valve didn't force me to have it added in my library one day for no reason. I will give it a bit of credit though, the graphics are pretty I guess.  On a side note I am prepared for this review is going to get down bombed by die-hard fans like all the other negative ones.
9303	0	a	The game had great mechanics and entriely the driving experience felt smooth overall. I even found the driving experience so smooth that I wasn't concentrated on jerking motions from the car and rather the turns focused my vision on the playing field instead of my position. The wide turns could sometimes be annoying, but this I found to be fundamental for the positioning aspect, that I aforementioned was backed up by a great driving experience. What more could you want in a competitive/casual car game? Well I found myself after playing Rocket League slowly not wanting to play it again. I couldn't place my finger on any true issue with mechanics or gameplay, but effect of after playing a round was unsatisfying. If asked by my friends to play a round of Rocket League, I was hesitant at first. I can tribute this very much to the experience I felt when playing PAYDAY 2, in such that when I open the game now, the excitement of playing it was already lost (now having 24 hours in the game). Nothing truly takes me back to wanting to play Rocket League and I only have 2 hours in the game. So, if I were to reccomend the game to a friend I wouldn't be quite sure what to say. Games like CS:GO have me constantly wanting to play another match after I am done with the previous one, but Rocket League just doesn't. Maybe the game can give a more capturing feel, sense of more achievement, or non monotonmous races (never once was I on the edge of my seat playing Rocket League). I can't exactly say Rocket League is a bad game but I would not feel happy classifying it as good game either, in my personal opinion. So I guess it is a opinion that should determine the purchase of the game.
9304	0	a	10 out of 10
9305	0	a	TL;DR: Bad support for keyboard users, devs doesn't care enough to fix it.  This game mostly caters to controller, and as a result it's a lot harder to play on keyboard even when small fixes could make it a lot better, this is the reason for the thump down. What I mean about this, is that they have made it a possibility to bind your mouse x and y axis to free cam mode, but the free-cam mode also always try to center to the original position, therefore it creates a problem for keyboard users, as it isn't a continues input.  This is a easy fix, and people have been talking about this for at least a year time, without any changes. To me that's a clear indication that the devs don't care about the keyboard users, and therefore deserve a thump down.
9306	0	a	this is an app store game
9307	0	a	How can I be getting 40 ping and 60 fps, yet every game there is constant lag and rubberbanding? Until it is fixed, this game is unplayable in multiplayer.
9308	0	a	Do not play this game. This game is actually fairly well made and isn't the worst game I have ever played. The community is toxic and will spam you full of hate and Rocket League do nothing to prevent this from happening. People who are good at this game very often lose and there is far too much luck in this game to be accountable for. I therefore do not recommend buying this game. I have all the DLC and have spent a lot of money on this game however still I get 0 luck in this game. Stupid frustrating and unfair.
9309	0	a	No mouse support. Yes I am 100% serious. Do not buy unless you plan to use a controller.
9310	0	a	Read guides. Tried to do that what they wrote. Lose, ok this happend. 1 or 2 times.. but not over 30 times in a row. This game dont have a match making system and this sucks... im in the semi-pro rank, and fight near only vs masters/veterans.

9314	0	a	HEAR IS MY REVIEW AFTER 1200 HOURS  pros-its fun with friends and sometimes in solo que cons- 1.where to start atleats 95 percent of people are in challnger or below and they think they are good. 2.people are just super bad at this game i mean worse than every matchmaking game ive ever played combined and im 24 so thats alot of mm games. 3.majority of people think the game is just hit the ball yolo style its not they dont think before they hit it they have no positioning no accuracy no rotation no passing ability. they game is ment to be played by hitting the angles you want to and thinking ahead not just yolo hit it.   all and all only reason to buy this is if u have friends who play it so i wouldnt recommend it
9315	0	a	DO NOT BUY  This game is a terrible game, the graphics are garbage and game play is horrible and its not worth the money.
9316	0	a	This game has broken physics. In this game if you do not have luck, you are totaly worthless. On my play time here, I have met lots of different people, who have used games broken physics and luck to win the game against me, and after the game they are thinking that they are good because of the broken physics and luck. So yeah, this game doesnt requires skill, all you need is stupid knowledge of the physics and tons of luck, if you don't have any of those, don't buy it, it's worthless.
9317	0	a	before the update the game ran fine now it glitches more than the forest to the point where you dont even want to play it anymore even if you dont play online      
9318	0	a	i cant play online and theres no fix i want a refund 
9319	0	a	DO NOT BUY  This game is a terrible game, the graphics are garbage and game play is horrible and its not worth the money.
9320	0	a	I know this game is the buzz right now, but having given it multiple honest chances, I can safely say this is not for me. In my opinion the game gives for endless tedium cycles, lol-so-random terrible physics and wobbly quirky car collisions rather than what I'd imagine car soccer could be. The game's lack of offsides, horrendous jump mechanic and the ball's martian gravity like behavior give for more frustrating moments, with tiny bits of fun spread out few and far apart.  All in all, greatly underwhelming, but moreso, incredibly frustrating and borderline playable.

9326	0	a	it was good at first now servers lag all the time and plus you let ps4 have it too... awful game hardly play this ♥♥♥♥ anymore 
9327	0	a	Fun when its not crashing
9328	0	a	The physics of the game are cool.  The waste of space teammates are not and I don't want to play 1v1.  I either get teammates who sit in the net the entire game, wasting a spot on my team, unable to block any shots that comes at them... or teammates who spend more time ramming me than the ball, leaving the 2 of us halfway up a wall while the other team takes the ball to score.  I just don't understand why there isn't like a common knowledge training session for this, or just give us a mode with 10v10 so it's as ridiculous as it honestly already is.  *Edited Review for the Rocket League fanboy who got butthurt over it in comments. This review IS about ranked play and there is NOTHING else to review about this game. You drive and jump while chasing a ball. It's fun for an hour but you're going to get annoyed with your teammates because that's how gaming goes in 2016.

9332	0	a	IM F*CKING TELEPORTING I CANT F*CKING PLAY
9333	0	a	In the current state of the game, I cannot recommend it, and I cannot recommend it for several reasons.  #1 -- Awful matchmaking: If you are a solo player, or ever want to play solo, do not play this game. There is nothing in ranked that protects you from being matched against a premade. It is the same problem that World of Warcraft has with battlegrounds. Of course, if you want to stomp a team 50% of a time if you have a team, then maybe it would be for you. But, the current state of matchmaking is unbalanced and inefficient.  #2 -- No real penalty for quitters. The quitters are everywhere and often. Most of the time, one of the teams will become inbalanced either at the first goal, or from someone not making the initial connection.   #3 -- Server lag. The servers are incredibly laggy at the moment. In many matches, it's so bad that everything seems to teleport along. The servers are utter garbae in thi sgame.  #4 -- No customization. Want to build your car to be a certain way? Perhaps have better handling at the cost of acceleration? None of that in this game. All cars have equal performance with tweaks being entirely cosmetic.  #5 -- The biggest gripe is the community. This game has a horrible community that makes League of Legends look like a therapy session by comparison.   CONCLUSION: This game has the components to be a good game, but it's not there yet. There's a lot to be desired with this title and it needs to grow up to be worth what they're asking for it. Not recommended at this point.
9334	0	a	servers are extremely laggy and people leave in the middle of their games

9338	0	a	Rocket Power  Here it is, everyone - eSports. In trying to legitimize playing video games as anything other than a complete waste of time, Psyonix have crafted quite possibly the most boring game I've ever played. Playing Rocket League is like playing a real sport, except it comes with none of the satisfaction that playing a real sport has. Sure, you just drove your cyber-car into the digi-ball, scoring the game winning hyper-goal, but at the end of the day you're still a gross smelly nerd playing video games and probably jacking off to anime girls. If I score a goal in soccer, I feel happy not only because I'm helping my team win, but also because I'm bettering my body and mind at the same time. I want to be able to win a game and then not immediately feel immense disappointment because nothing I've accomplished is real.  In attempting to emulate a real sport, Psyonix also failed to properly utilize their medium. Rocket League is so simple that any novelty or entertainment factor that it has quickly wears off as long as you're a normally-functioning adult. Think to any other game that one would consider an 'eSport', and you'll quickly see how little depth there is to Rocket League. Hell, Counter Strike, another game which requires very little strategy, is much more complex simply because of the nature of the game.  In short, what we have here is an attempt to fuse two incompatible worlds: that of real sports, and that of fake sports. In doing so, Psyonix has stripped away what makes each of these unique, and the result is some sort of unholy abomination that is better off turbo-blasting itself into the dumpster.  Taster's score: C-
9339	0	a	This game has the potential to be great, but honestly, I cannot recommend it to anyone in its current state!  I haven't had a lag-free match in at least a week now. Because of the fast-paced gameplay, this is absolutely game breaking.   DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IN ITS CURRENT STATE!
9340	0	a	This game ♥♥♥♥ING sucks horse ♥♥♥♥. Please do not think about buying it, if you do please KYS. If you already own this game and still play it you should die in a fire in front of your famly.

9342	0	a	cool concept but the game isn't well executed. it's horribly optimized so my computer overheats a lot while im playing even on the lowest possible settings. i can run skyrim just fine on my computer on medium. also the AI is straight up ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ so if someone leaves your team and an AI comes in then you're guaranteed to lose. definitely not worth $20. $10 at most

9353	0	a	First of all, Rocket League is a great, simple game that I would enjoy. Soccer (or football whatever you call it) is usually a type of video game I don't like. But this is just fun. But there is one major problem that makes me hate this game now. THIS GAME CAN DESTROY YOUR COMPUTER'S HARDWARE. I would wait at least 1 to 2 months untill they make sure this is patched because untill then I am never going to re-purchase this game, and I am getting my money back, thanks for reading, and have a great day. -------------------------------------- Overall Score: 0/10

If I could have a game removed from my library this would be it. I would rather slice my genitals with rusty razors. This game is the worst thing to happen to the PC platform EVER. The turning radius is far too large for these small cars. I wish I could just erase the memories of this game from my mind...
9357	0	a	Dont recommened this game if you have a non high graphic pc it will not run right.... i loved it but not for my pc.....
9358	0	a	This is a really fun game to play, but it costs to much on the steam market. Don't buy it if it isn't on sale and don't don't buy it if you don't have any friends to play it with.
9359	0	a	No gamepad connected - Rocket League identifies the Thrustmaster 16000m flight stick as your gamepad (game unplayable, can't control camera)  Unplug joystick - Rocket League identifies the Logitech G27 racing wheel as your gamepad (still unplayable, can't control camera)  Plug in actual Xbox controller and restart Rocket League - Xbox controller not found, Thrustmaster 16000m joystick takes priority and is identified as your main gamepad (game unplayable, can't control camera)  Switching USB ports didn't help.  TLTR; Refunded. Not worth the hassle if you own too many peripherals.

9362	0	a	Yea, everyone is having a great time on it, but this game just isnt working for me. Every time I start up the tutorial or join a match, as soon as the game loads up I crash. My laptop specs are well above minimum requirements, it just crashes for no apparent reason. Many people are complaining about the crashes happening at different times. So, I'm not quite sure how to rate a game I cant even play but I'm very disappointed.

9366	0	a	Great game, but the many flaws make this unworthy to recommend so far, most of them are small issue that are not from the gameplay, but from functionnality. That will probably be fix in the coming month.  Like no option to not join a 5-1 game that had a leaver..... I end up wasting 15 minute joining started game with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ score instead of playing in a new one.....  No way to invite friends from the ps4..... wasn't this on the store-page information....  Some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ idea that hotmail is not a valid email format to join their forum..... cause troll use only hotmail....  A rematch system that changes the team your in.... whats the point.....  But damn the gameplay is fun ^^     
9367	0	a	This game is very fun and enjoyable and I have also watched many youtube videos about it. After this I had decided to buy the game. I was thoroughly enjoying myself but then it blue screened now i can only play 1 and sometimes 1.5 games then it blue screens. I have also had some problems with my progress reseting. I was quite dissapointed. If the developers see this please try to fix this.
9368	0	a	cant even play this game, it starts, and anytime i start any game, itll show the ball, then crash 'TAGame has stopped responding' something like that. i would enjoy it but i cant enjoy a game i cant play
9369	0	a	overrated game, pure luck based
9370	0	a	most repetitive game i have ever played not worth £15
9371	0	a	I was unable to play this 20$ game because it times you out after 15 seconds when join... i give this 5/10 because even though i was unable to play the gamee, others that can thoroughly enjoy it.
9372	0	a	I wish i didnt waste 20 freaking dollars on this game i only play it beacouse i payed for it and it would be even more of a waste if i didnt. For me the reasons that i dont like the game are : the servers are terrible, and its no fun.
9373	0	a	God where to start this game is comicly bad like the devolpers did not even try. At one point I hit a ball sideways and it cured straight into my goal -_-. I tried this glitch when hitting it sideways next to the enemy goal and guess what it worked! Ugh the camera is so bad it rapidly flails everywhere unless in ball cam which of locks on the ball. overall this games gets  4/10 camera ruins most of it but also bad programming
9374	0	a	This game is full of bug and lags
9375	0	a	suck cant even play MM cuz it says 'not logged in to rocket league servers'

9383	0	a	I would enjoiy this game if it did not crash when i try to join or set up a game  Can anyone reply how to fix this problem.
9384	0	a	This is utterly broken. It's crap. Don't buy it.  So, this game got a lot of attention and yeah, everyone needs it? No. My bias upfront: I hate football (or soccer, if you're from _that_ country) and suck at driving games. So I was really quite certain that this game isn't for me, but a nice YT guy convinced me that it might be fun, if played with the right crowd.  That's the problem: The online sessions are broken. I have a play time of around 4h (more than 50% of that was incidently the game sitting idle in the menues, while I tended to my kids I guess. Steam refunds are only possible within the first two hours. Oh my...).  A normal session, limited to Europe as region, looks like this:  - Wait - Wait some more, because only 4 out of 6 show up - Wait times out, 2 bots join - Those bots score more than everyone else and do insane stuff  Yay. The AI is good. That isn't fun, though. It's rare to have a full human match and the difference in skill level - at my level - is too big. AI = Amazing, Everyone else is .. somewhere between incompetent and somewhat capable (I'm heavily leaning towards incompenent myself).  If you ignore that there are no (full) games: Even a mediocre difference in ping leads to a completely broken game experience. Mine is usually around 20, if some of the rare humans in a match have something around 90-100 the game is unplayable. The ball jumps back and forth, travels back in time and the game is - there is no other word - broken beyond repair.  Combine this: 'Not enough human players' with 'Enough latency and the game is unplayable' and .. well - fun, right?  I regret every cent I payed for this game. It's not only bad, it's the worst game for me this year and I don't recall a worse game from 2014. I wanted to exercise the 'Refund' option for the first time in my loooooong Steam history, for this very game. Unfortunately - as described above - sitting idle in the menus is 'playing the game' for Steam, so yeah, I totally 'played' this game for 4h so far and therefor cannot get my money back.  The least I can do is to state here that - The game is utterly broken - I advise you not to buy this game - You should - if you ignored the first two bullet points - give it 90min to confirm my complaints and instantly ask for a refund  Blech.
9385	0	a	Great Game RUINED BY SERVERS!  game mechanics are good a simple pick up and play game, you do have to take the time to learn more advanced stuff like saving the ball better and boosting and flipping at the right time. Id love to reccomend the game but the games servers every day are bad full of lag and rubberbanding everywhere. Servers are meant to be dedicated I cant say if they are because they are awful when trying to play a game lag free and problem free.  If the servers were fixed then I would reccomend the game to others but at the moment I cant which is a shame because when it does work it is an amazing addictive game.

9391	0	a	very laggy on my computer :/
9392	0	a	Rocket League and Steamworks seem to be willing to take your money for games that do not work properly and provide you with no good option for getting support or providing you with a refund. We have been trying to use Rocket League for several hours and it continually says we are offline and need to connect to the internet even though the computer is connected to the internet and all other programs that require an internet connection are working property. I tried emailing the one email address that is listed for Rocket League as 'support' and it comes back as undeliverable. When I check the blog sites, I see others making the same comment. Steamworks does not provide any email address for anything.
9393	0	a	The server lag is real.
9394	0	a	Servers are laggy especially when in Competitive. Not to mention the fail competitive system. When someone leaves in the first 10 seconds (or even later) the game is not cancelled or you don't get a bot to help out. If you like frustration this is the game you want
9395	0	a	The game doesn't work on windows 10

9402	0	a	I love the game's mechanics and idea. It seems like a good game but I can't play because I constantly have 250 ping (eventough I have good internet). This might possibly be caused by the fact that I live in Asia and there is no Rocket League Asia server.  TLDR; Good game, too much ping. Please make an Asia Server.
9403	0	a	I though't i had Ad-block enabled.

9409	0	a	this game sucks i still cant play it becuase it wont connect me to the servers 
9410	0	a	0/10 this game sucks do not buy it you will regret it
9411	0	a	Game is fun, but it have been weeks since it got released and the servers are still VERY laggy, in fact.. it's unplayable online at times.. if the servers are even up. I don't recommend this game until they fix it. Also, on their twitter, there are only posts about streams, tournaments and merchandise.. i mean, HOW HARD CAN IT BE? TO FIX SERVERS THAT WORK?.  11/10, best lag simulator out there.. would lag again
9412	0	a	Bought it but had to get a refund because online wouldn't work. It simply wouldn't let me join any games saying i wasn't connecting to rocket league. I read the forums they said it'll still work just ignore the message so i did. After restarting steam, verifying game cache, and trying other games to test my connection, i tried the game again. Still wouldn't work i'd let it search for a game for about 20 minutes each time. Normally i don't downrate a game over a glitch but the team has yet to reply after about a week of asking for help. All they say is 'ignore it' but i can't, because it doesn't work. I'll re buy it if they ever respond but didn't want to go past my 2 week limit.
9413	0	a	Gameplay is smooth and addictive, better with friends might I add but there is something lying beneath. Devs have released an 'update', oh wait I'm sorry the update is $3.99 my mistake. Greedy developers... I paid for the game once already why should I have to pay MORE on top of that for a release that should be free and as an update. You have a great game here and I see alot of potential, but don't go down this road.
9414	0	a	I will give this review a thumbs up when it offers us the Warthog from Halo. Xbox has it so there's no ♥♥♥♥ing excuse here.
9415	0	a	dont bother on this one okay? it has TONS of latency issues and runs at smooth 14fps on my 1000 dollar pc with additional 1000 dollars of upgrading it
9416	0	a	Game based on luck unluckers will lose a lot competetive is trash too :\ 
9417	0	a	Game shouldn't ban you from matchmaking for 15 minutes when you quit a ranked match ­­­&gt;_&gt;

9423	0	a	this game is great. if it works. honestly, it has SO many issues with controllers. it has so many issues with computers in general. be ready to get frustrated at 'rocket league has stopped working' crashes and stuff. even happens in the middle of a game.
9424	0	a	The only way you can enjoy this game is with good FPS which I don't have.. (I have 40) If you don't have alot you will lag so hard! It sucks for me because I can't get my money back! Please consider this before buying!
9425	0	a	WTF i am getting timed out everytime PLZ HELP! :(
9426	0	a	Unplayable due to excessive server lag, do NOT buy

9430	0	a	Good game, terrible servers are the only thing that let it down.
9431	0	a	Claims to offer cross-platform multiplayer; will not let you form teams or parties with friends on other platforms.
9432	0	a	I still dont understand the $20 price tag, deffinetly not worth that at ALL wait for it to be on sale and sure. the content is minimal and relies solely on the 'customization' which they have already started releasing DLC for a game that isn't even 2 months old.
9433	0	a	I have played Rocket League on both PS4 and PC. I really enjoyed the game on PS4, but on the same internet connection the PC version is constantly lagging to the point of being unplayable at times. I have great ping and near 200mbps/download and regardless it just keeps on lagging.   Bottom line, this is a really fun game to play without lag. I am not sure what is wrong to make it constantly lag for days again and again, but it makes it unenjoyable and unplayable for me.   
9434	0	a	i have a gaming pc but the game is going crazy
9435	0	a	Game worked fine for a couple of days but now I can't get it to launch. A window pops up and says the game is preparing for launch. About half a second later it stops the launch and nothing happens.   For the gameplay I recommend it, tons of fun. But they better fix this issue otherwise I've lost 20 euro
9436	0	a	I was trying to play ranked matches and there is no punishment for those players who do not finish the match. Instead, they are free to leave at any time. The matches are only 5 minutes long, but if your team goes down by 2 or more goals, its like people immediately leave and get to the next game. Additionally, the core experience of the game is understood within 3 minutes. Most of your games will play out in the exact same fashion, very rarily will it be close and even when it is, its not all that exciting. 80% of goals are luck/physics based.  Customization options are pretty limited outside of picking some decals and some color, but you can't really go too crazy with it. Everyone is on the same playing field, quite literally. There are no clases and no real 'depth' to the game outside of 'I should play more defensively right now' or 'I want to score a goal' -- 2/3 of the people on your team will definitely want be scoring a goal, and it gets out of control quickly. There is little strategy involved.  For me, this game was not fun past the first 30 minutes. I cannot recommend this game to friends or even strangers at this pricepoint. Its a great game for around $5 or less, but until it hits that pricepoint, you should pass.
9437	0	a	The game is obviously great, it's pretty much a copy of Super Sonic Acrobatic Rocket Powered Battle Cars, so if you played that (like me), you know how fun this game is, if you didn't, play this instead, it's very fun and highly competetive, while being graphically and technologically up-to-date to this gen standards  However, the lag kills all the fun, servers are still down from time to time, and i don't remember last time i played with someone who had a ping less than 50 for European servers and someone with ping less than 200 for US servers, if the game suddenly starts awkwardly rewinding you and repositioning you and all other players in the field then don't worry, it's normal, it's a problem with the game that devs for some reason can't seem to be able to fix, until they fix it, no recommend.
9438	0	a	First game to make me Break my computer Screen 10/10
9439	0	a	Ehhhhh.... really fun game to start. Lots of bugs and plauged by lag spikes. Sweet first week of play but then worthless.   Buy and try. Then quit.  *Edit* Bugs are fixed i guess. Lag still ruins games. 1v1 is depressing for that reason. Rubberbanding is just depressing. Can be fun with friends but they haven't fixed multiplayer across platforms either.
9440	0	a	For $20 I expected more. Good time waster that will get old after playing for an hour.
9441	0	a	Worst game ever.Don't buy it. Glitches everywhere,servers are bad (1-tick servers). If you buy this you wasted your time,your life,your money. If i would to give this game a price for it's gameplay,performance It would be free. So crap
9442	0	a	Aparently it is not alowed for a goaly to sit still for more than 20 second because he will get kicked, add an idle timer or a warning, I will change this revieuw once that is done.
9443	0	a	This game if a ♥♥♥♥ing piece of ♥♥♥♥. Won't even ♥♥♥♥ing start up, it just crashes everytime and no one has any ♥♥♥♥ing clue why. Fix your piece of ♥♥♥♥ game
9444	0	a	Was a great game,Servers went to ♥♥♥♥. Ever match since the update i have been at 140 ping +
9445	0	a	FIX YOUR BLOODY SERVERS YOU DIP♥♥♥♥♥  Okay, now that I've had some time too cool down (I was raging when I first wrote this) I'll write a proper review.  This game...Is a LOT of fun. It REALLY ERALLY is. But the games servers aren't very stable. At all. nor is thier matchmaking system. Since this is basically at its core a multiplayer game, these two issue force me to give a negative review.  For example. You load into a ranked 2 player game, but because the servers are unstable someone is often left without a teammate, and in ranked you aren't given an AI replacement.  At least 40% (more likely more) of thier servers lag horribly, causing you to miss your targets. While mildly amusing, these games are extremely frustrating.  That games lots of fun when you have close, competitive games, but its also really irritating when you have these games interupted with complete trash, laggy servers or poor matchmaking.
9446	0	a	Piece of ♥♥♥♥ game, piece of ♥♥♥♥ ball whoever made this should kys, that ♥♥♥♥ing ball didnt hit the ground god damnit there is just no way that thhe ball hit the ground, if you already have this game unistall immediatly.

9450	0	a	The game when i manage to play it is very fun, unfortunately for the most part as it is now it is absolutely broken. I cannot join a game as it crashes whenever i try to do so. There is a horrible problem where as it does crash and i close it with task manager the game is still running in the background as a process and i cannot close it. It prevents my computer from shutting down and i have to hard reset. In short the game is hindered by horrible technical issues right now.
9451	0	a	Game is really fun and i really enjoy playing it.   BUT  When i logged on today to play it i saw there was a huge update fully loaded with new content THAT I CANT EVEN ♥♥♥♥ING USE im sitting here for ten minutes downloading an update FOR DLC. And when you think of 'dlc' you may think of new arenas etc. but no there is 2 new cars, and multiple new customization options, that you have to buy.   I mean look at this :   ''Added 'Supersonic Fury' DLC Pack Support, including..  (DLC) Exclusive 'Dominus' and 'Takumi' Battle-Cars  (DLC) Six Decals for each new vehicle  (DLC) Five new paint types: 'Brushed Metal, Carbon Fiber, Metallic Pearl, Pearlescent,' and 'Wood'  (DLC) Two new Wheels: 'Cristiano' and 'Spinner'  (DLC) Two new Rocket Boosts: 'Burnout' and 'Nitrous'''  So i guess they are literally just adding new content to the game and calling it dlc. Unbelievable. I am extremely dissapointed with this. I was really excited to see the new content that would come out with this game every few updates and then this ♥♥♥♥ happens. sigh.

9459	0	a	This gane is good for about an hour or two of fun. But there is very little contant here (stadiums, cars and custom game settings) so you will see everything this game has to offer very quicky. The game does a bad job of telling you what your next reward will be. Back in the day, this sort of game would have beencalled a 'rental', good for a weekend but hard to recommend a permenant purchase. If you see the game on sale(and ppl are still playing it) then buy it.   In additon, i have never played a multiplayer game where your team mates foil your efforts as much as this. there really are a lot of useless players. the casual and ranked playlists should be merged into rnked ones. got very tired of playing with useless people.
9460	0	a	look it would be a great game but at this point the server lagg makes this game suck. you just cant play with this lagg
9461	0	a	-234213878941748912372148/10 dont buy. waste of money
9462	0	a	Although the game is fun, this fact is overshadowed by the AWFUL match-making and multiplayer connection issues. The first time I played I went up against 'Semi-Pro' players, and got dumpstered. The fact that the game puts me up against people with hours in the game when i just started, leaves a bad taste in my mouth.  *Edit* Anyone who is thinking about buying, the people that say the reviews are unhelpful just say so because they are biased about the game, do not purchase until match making and server connection issues are fixed.
9463	0	a	Alas this game seems to crash upon attempting to load gameplay for Me, even with lowest settings on. I have tried twice now to run the game but no joy, perhaps with a few updates it will become smoother.

EDIT: TO PEOPLE WHO THUMBS DOWN: READ THESE AND SEARCH FOR 'LAG' OR 'SERVER' IN DISCUSSION: 1-  http://steamcommunity.com/app/252950/discussions/0/537402115077700239/#p13  2-  http://steamcommunity.com/app/252950/discussions/0/541906989407521204/   AND TOO MANY MORE
9469	0	a	Game is too fun, i do not recommend it. It will take over your life, hide your wife and kids.
9470	0	a	This is a great game like SARPBC (Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket Powered Battle-Cars). This game brings back good memories of it. If you are a regular gamer and u do not know SARPBC I strongly suggest you get the game as it is very good. But for someone like me a die hard fan of SARPBC it dosen't cut the mustard. As to me it feels like a they have just retextured the old game and given it a better name. There are new things I like e.g. The customisation system. But they sorta dummed it down they removed the funky and weird maps and used the bog standard maps one of the maps is reused but they gave it a texture upgrade. They have got rid of challenges that made the game so fun sometimes by adding a small but game changing twist. The game is not as chaotic as it use to be. I tried the AI and majority of the time they do not boost. which ruins half the fun when playing with them as the most you got to worry about is being hit out of the way. In SARPBC they would boost and u would have to worry about being destroyed at a moments notice (I know it is designed for multiplayer but not everyone wants to constantly be on multiplayer). In my opinion of a die hard fan they have gone back a step from a amazing game to a really good one. So with a Heavy heart have to give it a thumbs down. Even though it is a good game.
9471	0	a	i've have issues with the game only becausethe connections are bad with other players and this seems to freeze the game after every match
9472	0	a	Game crashes immediately upon entering any match. Even on the lowest settings with a good PC. Many many others are having the same issue, and no solutions have been made available.
9473	0	a	Seems like a fun game, but i don't recommend buying it if you live in Australia. Unless you like jumping around like a kangaroo. No my internet is not the problem.
9474	0	a	I cannot connect to Rocket League servers... Can anyone fix this?
9475	0	a	European player, 1000 rating 2v2, 900 3v3 solo writing this review.  This game is great, tactical, technical and fun BUT something is destroying the fun in this game... the INSTABLE SERVERS.  The game is released since 23 days and every 2 games you get to play on a EU server are lagging, not matter the time of day, lagged at 2pm and the whole evening too.   You win or lose your game but the worst of it, you spend 5min struggling against the lag, cause this lag is not even latency issue, it teleports you all around the stadium, slows the cars, slows the ball, getting you forward and backward then forward again. Some players prefer to leave the game to search another one on a stable server... Russian roulette.  The developers don't care about the quality of gaming on their game. They took our 20e and don't care about players issues, I didn't bought this game to play training...  I don't recommand buying this game until lags have been resolved on EU server, I play pretty much only ranked and when you lag and lose a game cause you can't control your own car... you feel screwed.
9476	0	a	Seems like a fun game, but i don't recommend buying it if you live in Australia. Unless you like jumping around like a kangaroo. No my internet is not the problem.
9477	0	a	Okay,   Yes it's fun. Nothing to say about that.  But please, when you charge 20 Euros for a game please have servers ready. If you have more than 45 MS the game is unplayable. Moreover on game out of 3 the server lags like crazy (i.e. you see things teleport).  Good idea. Terribly executed. Do NOT buy !
9478	0	a	Promised free DLC to get sales, now that the game is popular, we have paid DLC.
9479	0	a	DO NOT BUY THIS STUPID GAME CALLED 'Rocket League'  Boring Game..  Always the same anyways.. Football is 11 vs 11 not a 3 vs 3 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  Thanks JaspeR 
9480	0	a	I actually loved the game when it worked, very enjoyable. Looks better on a good PC than PS4 of course. However, it won't run on laptops very well and recently stopped working on my desktop for no apparent reason. It appears this game has a lot of issues running on peoples computers despite how simple the game is. There is no method on the internet that I could find to make the game work again.  Also, I've reported these issues in the manner they requested with details and a dmp file. Even so, I never got a responce even after a month. Poor form guys, thats not how you make me buy your games again.  I would recommend this for PS4 until they update properly.
9481	0	a	Ok so this game contains :  RC cars (kids and menchildren) and football (Sports enthusiasts and tryhards).  Recipe for disaster if you ask me.  Was hitting the ball around and some kid had a mental breakdown just because we couldn't hit a ball inside a goalpost with our RC cars. Even typing this out amazes me. I was laughing the entire match. This is such an arcady game yet people treat this like professional sport.  Still gonna play it from time to time.  reddit the game.
9482	0	a	Fun but stressful as ♥♥♥♥
9483	0	a	Game not finished. fps drops on rain maps. shoot ball in the corner -&gt; ball directly into goal. (Should not happen that easily, game contains most of the time lucky goals because of this.) boring as ♥♥♥♥
9484	0	a	The game and the idea behind it are pretty fun, but the lag makes it pretty much unplayable.

9512	0	a	It's a good, fun game however I recommend buying it on sale. The reason I'm giving it a begative review is the lack of options/game modes. I know there isn't a lot of game modes you can do with a game like this but I'm talking about things like: making season mode multiplayer (for people who have friends they wanna play a tournament with.) or being able to change how long a match lasts rather than 5 minute matches (I find 5 minute 1v1's too long). You can customize your car but you can't customize your team. It's the things like this that make the game boring. I'll delete this review when they change all this and add more things like this to the game. If you enjoy playing same thing over and over buy this game, if you expect a long lasting game with more than you expect, hold off for a sale.
9513	0	a	Great game. Indecent lag.
9514	0	a	Pros: - Simple, back-to-basics gameplay - All progression is skill-based, only differences are cosmetic - Easy to learn, hard to master  Cons: - Abysmal performance - Levels have an appalling amount of cruft. There is no reason for the buildings that form a vague skybox (which itself is hardly even visible through the stadium and fog) to have traffic going through them, eating up power, while the effect can't be seen from the stadium in the first place - Shoddy patches. Performance somehow even worse after 1.03 (freezes/skips every few seconds) - No Linux/mac version (what 'licensing issues'? what attempts have there been made?) - The servers  Good game, but they need to finish it first. 'Finishing' includes optimizing. If you have plenty of horsepower then by all means, go ahead. It plays well and is relatively addicting. But if you don't, expect an awful experience, and be happy that steam does refunds nowadays. Not recommending until they fix their ♥♥♥♥. We don't all have $500+ to blow.
9515	0	a	need SEA server overall is good but need SEA server so we from asia not lagging so much
9516	0	a	For all asian , this game doesn't have asian server so our ping is too high but still playable   so that's it
9517	0	a	Laggy servers, crashed twice already just after install. Otherwise would be great.
9518	0	a	While the gameplay is excellent, there are many more issues that need resolved involving server issues, lost progression, and more. Additionally, until the new maps are brought out, everything is just a basic flat map with walls. The additional game modes and maps haven't been implemented yet.  Don't get me started on the incompetent team AI. If you play with the AI, be prepared to have your own team ♥♥♥♥-block you at every chance, score goals on your own goal, and more. Worse yet, if someone bails your online match, they're replaced with one of these AI which then gimps your team worse than having no one at all. I have literally watched, on many occasions, an AI from your team pushing the ball the entire way from the enemy goal to yours to score a point. They will incessantly push the ball towards their own teams goal.  Once this is all fixed I'd recommend it, but until then... No.

9525	0	a	This game did not have The Bahamian flag.  It has The Jamaican Flag, but no Bahamian flag.   The Bahamas is richer and more stable than Jamaica, why must games spit in the face of my country? This and the fact that steam region locks me with a bunch of spanish speakers when everyone in the country speaks english... war is the only option.   Once I get my flag / We win the war, this will be changed into a 'yes' reccomendation.

9530	0	a	This game makes no sense. The cars have limitless gasoline as if they have blackholes to contain the fuel and whiteholes to spurt them into the V8000 engine 9999999bhp. The car apparently seems to have super technic hydraulics that shouldnt even be available in the present world and allows for the cars to flip around and even jump twice. Don't even get me started on the ball itself. The ball is twice the size of the car and apparently carries explosives inside and explodes when taken into the goal. I don't understand how the drivers themselves live past one game. This game just doesnt make sense for it to be taken seriously.

9540	0	a	As much as I would like to believe the hype of youtubers and streamers I would not recommend buying this game at the moment. The online experience is pretty awful at the moment. Usually half of the team is AI (there really should be a penalty for abandoning a match) and whenever the game is rubberbanding it is just unplayable. Potentially a fun game, but these problems need to be fixed first.

9549	0	a	Completely hacked game. Do not waste your money. Instead, light your $20 on fire and gouge out your eyes with the flaming bill. Another garbage game, released without any anti-cheat, just to to make money. Screw the payers and the players...reward the script kiddies. GG
9550	0	a	While the gameplay is pretty fun, I don't think this game is worth $20. With essentially a single multiplayer mode, I question the longevity of this game.  Like many others have stated, keyboard and mouse controls aren't as responsive, and you can't really control the camera without using a controller. However, I haven't experienced much server issues that other reviewers have complained about.
9551	0	a	This game is balls
9552	0	a	This game is ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥! when i drive my car randomly gets boosts and spins around! WTF!
9553	0	a	This game is extremely fun at first, but bothers very quickly.  First of all, it's barely playable without Xbox controller (the ONLY controller supported by this game). Handling a car with WSAD is terrible. There's no camera pan by mouse or control of the car by mouse. Second, the gameplay is very primitive and randomized. Your success in it relies mostly on luck rather than skill. Third, the EU servers (don't know about the rest) are plagued with lags.

9561	0	a	This is quite possibly the worst game I have ever played. The servers are absoloutely terrible, you rubberband back and forward a game cannot even be played without this happening. The concept of the game is good, but the ball has way too much gravity it needs a little more weight to the ball..   Do NOT buy this game until they have fixed their server or you will find yourself losing games because when you get a hold of the ball you will go to kick the ball in and you rubberband backwards and lose control of the ball.  Absoloutely terrible game.

9563	0	a	I can not recommend this game. Just for the simple fact that people who has nivida cant run this at a decent 60 fps. Or just any gaming laptop in genral because you wont be able to run it at a decent framrate. I saw the pinned topic and it says that nivada panal controll does not support this game. Secondly there is alot of crashing. I apper ingame for about 3 seconds and then im kicked out it will also ask for fiel uplodes. Because of that i lost all my saved data and had to start over. 3rd and final this game is fun but if you have a gaming laptopt with nivida you might just want to get yourself a ps4 and play it on there, theres crossplay so you can play with you freinds on pc. This isnt made for a gaming laptop this is made for a high end pc even though it looks like one of those 10$ discount games you can find in gamestop

9575	0	a	Very positive rating? Yes positive with AIDS. I hate this game and the developers can go suck some.
9576	0	a	This game has a simple premise, and a simple goal! Score! Put the ball in the opponents net! IT Couldnt get any simpler! Its Football with cars! And for the first hour it was fun! The tutorial eased me into the game nicely, yet I felt the game could still offer me a great challenge beyond learning the basics. The graphics the games stability (baring match making) were all admirable.  My first Online match couldnt have gone better, I sunk 2 in the net and the team went on to win 5 - 2. Great I thought, thourougly enjoyed. However an hour later, and honestly, I was bored! The more matches I played the more I realised that this is just a physics based pot luck game. Every match was essentially 8 cars throwing themselves at this giant ball, hoping to either get the ball into the opponents half or score! And thats IT! Theirs literally nothing else to the game! Yes you can customise your cars etc! But the cars arnt that detailed, theirs no difference between them other than shape/looks. A van type car you would think would be purposed more towards defence vs the sportier sleeker cars etc, but No! Each car is identical, so what happens online is nothing short of 5 mins of manic chasing this giant ball. Getting bashed around left right and centre by not only the opposition, but equally by your team mates.   I keep seeing people saying the game has multiple layers of depth, and you can tell the skilled vs the none skilled players etc. Guess what? My team of all noob Rookie labelled players, just beat an entire team of Semi-Pros 6 - 2. Did we play well! NOPE, we just launched oursleves at the ball blindly and hoped for the best! The hitboxes on the cars are sketchy at best. On countless occassions I slowed down and methodically hit the ball from a certain angle i.e. left or right. Only to have the ball bounce straight up in the opposite direction!? I've scored from one end of the pitch to the other, even though the ball was actually put in the net by the opposite team, trying to clear it from the goal! Apparently this game has no concept of HOME goals!  I've watched numerous Twitch games streamed, and I'm sorry! I am yet to be convinced their is anything skilled about this game! Yes I have seen some fancy goals scored on YouTube etc, and people stating thats the difference between a skilled and non skilled player etc. Equally! If probably not more so, I have seen many incredible goals scored completely without intention or knowledge of the player who scored them, i.e. blind luck (or dodgy physics engine!).   This game to me was a 5min pick up and play game with friends on a Friday night, nothing more! The hype and reviews on this game at the moment I just dont understand! Its football with cars, without the complexities or intricacies of the beautiful game. Just be careful when you buy!  Watch a few videos, ignore the web reviews, just watch! Then make your decision! This is by no means a bad game by any shout! In fact I'd probably give it a 7/10, its a quick and easy to get into pick up and play game! Just beware of the hype machine on this one.

9582	0	a	I couldn't get the hang of it. I got it since my brother recommended it, but not matter how I set up the controls I can't get my car to do what I want.   I dislike the game for the same reason I dislike the Worms series (the controls). No matter what I'm always missing the ball, and or halfway across the field whenever I try to do anything.  I have tried to play the game for a little under an hour in tutorial, but I just keep getting frustrated. I'm refunding the game, because I don't feel like I will actually like, or play this game at all. I wouldn't look at just my review to make your decision though. My brother loves it. I want to like it, but it's just not for me.
9583	0	a	The gameplay itself is great, buy because i live in asia, the game always gets laggy.
9584	0	a	Awesome, addicting game. It offers simply fun. Only downside to its crossplatform-play is that it doesnt support party system, which is really annoying cause most of my friends got this on ps4, cause its FREE there. I only bought this to pc cause I was willing to show credit to games creators by paying for it, but now I feel bit cheated. Game was advertised as crossplatform game, and it doesnt have a party system there, VERY DISSAPOINTING from that perspective. Hope you fix it soon. Cant recommend it till that.
9585	0	a	This game really wastes your money! first..... Its super lagy very time it crashes so never even try this game!

9588	0	a	My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through.' I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway
9589	0	a	Servers were laggy and unplayable with a decent ping ( 80 ms ) and I was very disappointed as I looked forward to play this game before it became buyable in steam.  I refunded this almost immediately after trying it out and may purchase the game again in the future if they added Asia region and fixed their laggy servers.  I suggest you to wait till they have fixed the servers. I'm going with a thumbs down
9590	0	a	It's like Evolve; what's there is absolutely incredible. It's fun, it's polished (minus the poor servers, but I never had too many issues), and its unique. Really, this should be it - but it ain't. Just like Evolve the content that we recieved is good but I think we'll see Rocket League fizzle out and die for the exact same reason: there's just not enough content. With only one gamemode, little to no variation in maps, and the only real variation occuring in the number of players (1v1 - 4v4) taking part I just feel as if a £15 price tag is just too demanding for something that will grow old in a few hours.

9599	0	a	game is pretty fun...you just have to be lucky to find a good server because most of them are just terrible, is like playing 1999 unreal turnament on a 56k modem... (i have 100m cable and i lag like hell) hope they will fix this issue.
9600	0	a	This game is absolutely horrible if you don't play 2v2's or more with friends in solos this game is just so triggering to play it makes me literally want to cut myself.
9601	0	a	it was fun so i returned it
9602	0	a	Ok sorry for the lack of minutes but seriously this game is so laggy for me. i played it on the ps4 at a friends house and it was great, idk if its because i dont have a gaming computer or what but its so hard to play this
9603	0	a	This ♥♥♥♥ is too expensive... -.-
9604	0	a	my rocket league so ♥♥♥♥ i thing it couse of my low quality computer im hoping my dad buys me another one this chrithmas
9605	0	a	Simply put ... this game doesn't live up to the hype it's getting atleast i'm not seeying anything which is revolutionary or extremely intresting. Most likely for allot of gamers this game is a trip down memorylane thus they precieve the game differently. (note i'm not a racing fan nor am i a soccer fan it does help to atleast like one or both of them).  The price is simply too much for a simple game like this. It doesn't have enough in it to keep my intrest in the long run. Sure i play a few rounds with mates, but after 2-3 rounds i'm already starting to get bored. It's like one of these inbetween games, you play for 15-30 minutes and then move on to another game.  My biggest gripe being the price so unless it's in the sales ... not recommended. 
9606	0	a	Wtf are you doing here, go on the positive page !@#!@!
9607	0	a	It's fun for a while but gets incredibly repetitive fast
9608	0	a	well i clicked on the rocket league 4 pack and it says 26£ when it's the same game to the one that costs 8£ right?               i was so anoyed whaen baught 26£ one=(
9609	0	a	If u love to play with laggy servers this game is made for u
9610	0	a	Fun for an hour. Then it's the same over and over. Everyone says it's amazing but it's boring as hell. The game isn't polished very well either. This game would be better if it was free to play and maybe have cosmetic stuff as micro-transactions. Not worth the money for such a simple and unfinished idea. (Simple ideas aren't bad btw)
9611	0	a	How much money did it cost to get better position than undertale?
9612	0	a	By far worst game on steam.  Not worth playing even if it was free.  Community is Cancer fan boy trash no lifers who suck corperate d.i.c.k Note the amount of dislikes my review will get because fan boys of this game are so easy to make upset. I see you haters, just keep sucking that d.i.c.k  The game will ban you just for backing out of a match for 15mins.... Yeah get banned because you don't want to sit though a trash team.   Not to mention the microtransations this game has and all the other stupid crap that people take way to seriously.   Dislike button down below fan boys  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcLVX35wyjQ 
9613	0	a	your games does not ♥♥♥♥ing work you ♥♥♥♥ing imbeciles ♥♥♥♥ you ♥♥♥♥
9614	0	a	Dogshit game, this whole crossplatform is a load of dogshit, was playing final fantasy 14 and got my friends to purchase the game, then found out if they bought it on ps4 we can even be in the same party, dont advertise cross platform if WE CANT EVEN PLAY CROSSPLAYFORM YOU ♥♥♥♥♥
9615	0	a	this game would be nice if the match-making worked and if the AI wouldnt be better then all the players in the field, but they are. The AI usualy leads the team. in my opinion that is bad AI.
9616	0	a	Great game concept, But Terrible for pc since there is no freelook camera , its a game breaker who thell figured it was a good idea you cant look around with the mouse? please for the love that is pc gaming ADD A FREELOOK CAMERA!
9617	0	a	Promising but repetitive for sure. A good game and a cool idea, but has a few issues.  For starters, it crashes. Not a crazy amount, but I've had it for 24 hours and have had 4 crashes. It's not my system as I can run more demanding games without a problem. The server issues are well documented and accurate. There can be a lot of lag and a lot of disconnects.  Gameplay wise it is definitely fun, but having only exhibition games online is definitely boring after a while. I haven't played any offline yet so I can't comment on the season mode, but it would probably be more interesting online if there was some variety.  I don't know exactly what could make it better in terms of variety. Items? Weapons? Game modes? Larger teams/maps? All I know is that I hope they are experimenting with other ideas for online play because it is repetitive. Good for killing 30 minutes but thats about it.  Bottom line is I can't recommend it at full price. This would be a great pickup for $5ish but at $20 Canadian it is definitely too bland. Mechanics are excellent but theres not a lot there for twenty bucks.
9618	0	a	This game is bad when you dont have a GREAT computer, trust me when I say this, I have a computer less than a year old, and the games the laggiest game i've ever played this year so far. Aslo, the games controls are buggy, people say the controller is better but I find it harder, when I press a button on the controller (PS4) such as X (Jump) or R2 (Drive), the controller will act like I never hit X or it will short out when I push it. I really do want to see the gam get better, I will play it still, but just less untill its gets better.
9619	0	a	Nice game but Servers are still a disaster.  So the only part that is kinda fun is not working (one week after release). And one week is long time to fix servers if they are overloaded (as they claim)  Makes you think do they really deserve the money :P  
9620	0	a	i loved this game until the game WIPED ALL OF MY PROGRESS ITEMS AND LVL WTF !!!!!!!!!! DONT BUY THIS UNLESS U ARE INTO SNM AND WANT TO BE DOMINATED ♥♥♥♥ THIS COMPANY makes a good game with a huge flaw
9621	0	a	I downloaded this game. My computer is okay it runs League of Legends and CSGO no lag. But with this game everytime i start a game it crashes! I followed all the steps to fix the problem but nothing worked. I do not recemmend this game untill these problems are fixed.
9622	0	a	I really want to like this game, it seems really fun, but the multiplayer servers are awful. Consitently rubberbanding and struggling to find games.
9623	0	a	terrible match making system
9624	0	a	Such a waste of money, ever since the game was out there wasn't a single time that the servers were working. Even now, it either shows servers offline or just 0 online players 0 , 0, 0, 0 score for the game! Don't buy, unless you like plying by yourself against the damn pc. # @Incredipede, I checked today, managed to play online then it died again. The game is beautiful dnt get me wrong but online matches are what keeps it alive and if that will not work properly ... !
9625	0	a	cars dont have boobs
9626	0	a	4/10 because the price is a ♥♥♥♥ing rip off i can get better game for that price
9627	0	a	So far.. i bought this game 2 days ago.. my game is still bugged saying im not connected to the servers  no responses from the support team at all..
9628	0	a	A week in an still no european servers. Playing on US at 200ping and rubberbanding is no fun at all and the singleplayer isnt very entertaining after a few hours.  This is way overpriced for the content provided.
9629	0	a	Would be fun if online play wasn't so messed up. Servers are still a disaster.
9630	0	a	This game is literally debbie downs, Plz no flame. I rather kill myself than play this game, peckers. EZPK guess what? ♥♥♥♥ U
9631	0	a	ping 60 and super lag wow
9632	0	a	Fun game, really shine in multiplayer... Sadly multiplayer is the worst thing I've ever seen since quite some time. Servers have been crashed/offline most of the time. If you're one lucky ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you migh manage to play the game online but it's not over! Indeed now it is the lag fest, server lags a lot. When you start a game (if the matchmaking is working ofc) you have 80% chance to get a laggy/broken server where most of the player won't even load the game and where you have rollbacks/desync. It has been more than a week now and still no improvement on the laggy servers part, they breafly 'fixed' the matchmaking so it doesn't crash their servers and so it can match you on broken servers.  Edit : Decided to try harder with this game because you nerve know. Long story short : -European server with 50 latency that feels like 2000 latency. -US Server with 150 latency that feels like 150 latency. -Invisible Players, it can be a player from your team or the opposite. -The game crash randomly.
9633	0	a	Why oh why do I listen to Steam reviews....   If you are competitive leave this game be. It will drive you mad. Seriously.....
9634	0	a	absolute peace of ♥♥♥♥ game , full of lag , bugs and bs
9635	0	a	I used to own this game, but I refunded it because it crashes waaaay too much. If they fix this, then I might repurchase it. But as of now, its unplayable because of how much it crashes. I do not recommend this game unless they fix the crashing.
9636	0	a	The only reason I'm writing a negative review is because there is no ability to move the camera with your mouse (like you would whilst driving GTA for example). The camera is locked to either straight ahead, or to the ball. It's making me feel naseous. I need to be able to free-look with the camera with my mouse. Apart from that, this game is excellent and you should buy it.
9637	0	a	I cannot a game without it crashing. Until this game gets updated to fix the crashing issues I would not buy this game.
9638	0	a	Fun for the first 5 minutes, then turns stale. Not worth the cost and multiplayer does not work, despite recent fixes etc. Only one multiplayer game mode, plus a really boring single player league style game. Needs more gamemodes like CTF. Its boring, lacks a Linux version (Though ran superbly using Wine) and is the same thing over and over. Do not buy unless you are gulliable.    Does not live up to the hype from YouTubers and Streamers.
9639	0	a	People said it was good. I didn't like it, it was kinda fun for the first hour but by then I'd already seen the whole game.
9640	0	a	ya its a good game but BOTS.. BOTS!!? too good,, i see lot of Bots on other side of the team carrying the human being in game. i lost lot of games because of people not joining and bots has to play and carrying their team.
9641	0	a	Stupid game ever. I hate this uneducated childish concept. lmao I could have made better game than this alone
9642	0	a	Would be a great game if the FPS was so low.
9643	0	a	Terrible game, I can't even connect to play with my friends or play online at all. Right now it has been a total waste of money.
9644	0	a	fun game in season but online is completely broken and unplayable.
9645	0	a	I spent €20 on this game and it was amazing untill the first goal was scored from then on my game ALWAYS crashes when a goal is made. I did some research and found out that ALLOT of people have this problem (or other problems regarding crashes) i would love to play this game but if i cant than why did i pay? please fix this ASAP
9646	0	a	stole undertales spots on game of the year list plus not enough skeletons and sick beats in rocket league
9647	0	a	Most overrated game in the history, its boring and hard dont waste your time and money on this game.
9648	0	a	No camera angle control i was locked on reverse
9649	0	a	An amazing game...when it works online. Once they get their stuff together and fix the problems related to multiplayer and ranked ( getting ~200ms pings on EU servers, no leaver penalties, so you lose ELO just because your teammates ragequit, etc.) i'll update this review.
9650	0	a	The game is really fun when you can connect to a server.  I would reccomend it but not yet. The servers are all unstable, ranked games will kick you and the ball will rubber band across the stage. Its not fun getting scored on by ghost balls.
9651	0	a	I still can't play online. I've tried contacting the devs 3 times now. No responses or help with my problem. 'Not logged in to rocket league servers.' I've been getting this message for 3 days straight, all while the devs tweet about how many people are logged on and playing. I'd love to be one of those people. I've spent so much time trying to connect/join games/play online, that I'm past eligibility for returning this game and getting my money back. I have under 2 hours of actual gameplay, the majority of my time has just been spent getting denied by the servers.  Incredibly disappointing, I can't play the game online, and I can't get my money back.
9652	0	a	Good game for Playstation - or PC with a controller. If you dont have a controller its a waste of time and money.
9653	0	a	10/11 error 67 connection to server timeout. great game
9654	0	a	Cant even play the game because of ♥♥♥♥ servers
9655	0	a	There's a lot of hype surrounding this game, and I know people can be defensive about new releases that they love. Before you judge this review helpful or not, please read it, instead of crucifying me based upon my recommendation of this game.  Rocket League is essentially football with cars. There's actually a Top Gear episode that is pretty much exactly this game, minus the rocket boosters! Two teams of between 1 and 4 players face off against each other and try to score as many goals in a 5 minute period, using their custom vehicles to hit the ball - and each other - around the field.  This game is, undoubtedly, a lot of fun. The physics are funny, the cars drive well (though the rocket boost flying is tricky as all hell), it looks beautiful, it runs fantastically at least for me, so it certainly seems to be very well optimised, and I've had no frame rate issues so far. Surprisingly, they also didn't screw up the UI, which is a very common mistake.  So, if all I'm doing is heaping praise on Rocket League, why aren't I recommending it? Unfortunately, there is simply not enough content to justify a £15 price. Sure, there are tons of customisation options for your vehicle, and they are absolutely great and really make you unique. The problem is there's only one arena to play in, and after 2 or 3 games, it becomes very, very same-y. Sure, there are different skins for the arena, and day/night versions, but they don't change the gameplay at all. And really, petty though it may seem, that's all that's keeping me from recommending it.  At first, I honestly believed this was an Early Access title, and that more would be added soon. I feel as though this game might have benefited from a free-to-play model with cosmetic microtransactions, though it's hard to gauge how effective that may have been.  I would compare this game to the Mario Strikers series, as both are a kind of zany take on football. I know it's unfair to compare a AAA title from a Mario series to Rocket League, but I think the developers could have taken some great inspiration from Mario Strikers Charged. Power-ups, characters with different abilities, and hazardous arenas ensured that each game played very differently and was wildly unpredictable. To me, that's what Rocket League is missing, and why I can play Mario Strikers Charged again and again, but got bored of Rocket League within the hour. To anyone that's played Rocket League so far, imagine this: one player presses a button in the arena, and for a limited time, the sides of the arena only reflect the ball. Players can fall and be knocked off the sides, into the abyss. I think you get the picture: more inventive arena design really would have helped this game.  Recommending and not recommending is a thin line though, so while on the whole I would not tell me friends to pick this up, some people might enjoy this. If you and your friends intend on playing a couple of games every now and then, then you may well enjoy this a lot. If, however, you're looking to sink more than a few hours a week into a multiplayer game, then I do not believe this is for you.  Essentially, I would compare this game to a dolled up version of Air Hockey, because that's really what it is. For what it is, it's great and a lot of fun, but for me, and I imagine a lot of other people, that fun ran out extremely quickly. Perhaps DLC will add in what this game is currently missing, but for now, I cannot recommend it at this price.  5/10  P.S. If you do get this game, please, please make sure you have a controller. It shouldn't have to be said, but just in case: racing games on keyboard/mouse are awkward and poor to play, and you'll have a sub-standard experience. I've been using the Xbox controller, and it's worked great for me. If you have a different controller, try to find information on if/how it works with this game.
9656	0	a	Piece o ♥♥♥♥. Doesn't run well on a decent computer and the lag makes it impossible to play.
9657	0	a	It wont let me play online it just says connection lost error: 59
9658	0	a	Massive lag, AI destroying online games, at this point it is not playable and enjoyable. It has potential, but I got a refund instead of waiting. If they fix the issues in the future, I might buy again and change my review.
9659	0	a	this stupid game can't let u play a game with a local PC just like warcraft 3 i can't imagine how the devoleper didn't thought of that simple idea we always have to play online all the time and can't play Co op advinture mode on splitscreen in the same PC stupid game i don't recommand this stupid.
9660	0	a	This game is okay. It has some fun elements, but the controls and camera control are awful.

9666	0	a	Online server's haven't worked since launch. No signs of these issues being fixed. Sick of devs releasing games that don't work properly. Simple open beta to test the server load before launch could of easily forseen and help prevent this problem.  The game itself isn't terrible, but without online play kind of defeats the object of playing for me.
9667	0	a	I hate this game I cant even get into a game im sad I spent 20.00 dollers on this I was waiting for it to come out the game crashes every time i get into a match and I want a refund

9673	0	a	continuous server off.....
9674	0	a	****Review 7/7  Bought game this morning, still can't access Rocket League servers. I can do the tutorial and such, but that is it. I will redo the review once I am able to actually get into the game. I understand opening day issues, but the company should be posting this on the page to let people know.   ***Updated 7/8***  Servers now seem to be up, but search is broken. People have to use the forums to find others for matches. I would hold off buying this game till this company irons out the issues. My guess and it is only that, is that they should not have tried to launch on PS4 and PC on the same day, pick one or the other to do a first launch if you are a small company.
9675	0	a	the game laggggs to much i cant even play
9676	0	a	Very fun for the first couple of hours, but it gets pretty repetitive quite fast. Could use maybe a couple different game modes or some strategic abilities to make it playable for a bit longer. Not really worth the price.
9677	0	a	Cannot keybind for preipherals, and so while this might be fun, I cannot endorse it because of this.
9678	0	a	I did not play the game for long but i already requested a refund. I might be one of the only people that did not enjoy the playtime i had. AI is terrible, matchmaking system for me was ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. If i had more friends playing the game i would have kept playing but to play with randoms against other randoms was frustrating. i had 2 semi pros in my team and we got our asses kicked 4 times by a pro player that scored around 6 or 7 times a match. Ruined the experience for me.
9679	0	a	Enjoyable concept, but there is a lot of server lag and there are too many people in ranked matches that throw games with no meaningful way to have them reported. Yet, there are already making paid DLC.
9680	0	a	I love the game but i havent played it yet without constant ruberbaning and its literally just unplayable and its really a shame because i spent enough money on this for it to just not work i know it has potention i mean look at how possitive it is, but there is always one person who has a bad time or got unlucky which is unfortunatly me, but im really sad because i really wanted to experience what everyone else is soooooooo...  if u all could like this so it will be seen that would be very greatful because alot more people are having this experiance that i am then just me thanks.i would for sure love to like this once this gets fixed thank you!!!!!!!!!!
9681	0	a	DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!  I love this game, LOVE, but whoever is running the servers, does not care about it. You will get players with high ping that will just utterly ruins this game. 95% of the time, it will cause so much lag that you will not be able to line-up your car with the ball. The only way you can play this game, and not be frustrated, is if you're playing 1v1, which can be equally frustrating in it's own right.   It is absolutely impossible to play this game, unless the administrators get their acts together, because it is unbearable to play this game with high-pinging players. Even with players at 50 ping, on a 3v3, it can get choppy. Oh, and then you got foreign people playing on your side of the world, ruining every game in their midst. All of this can be solved if they just set their servers to auto-kick anyone with a ping of 100+, but they don't, for some brilliant reason.
9682	0	a	Im unable to submit a accurate review due to constant online lag issues. The only thing I can really comment on is the meh tutorial and the terrible AI when I try to play offline.
9683	0	a	Wanted to just send the developers a quick message, but there is no easy way to do that. Love the game. But i really like it when my internet studders for a minute then the game kicks me out for 15 minutes. Thanks Rocket League, great job
9684	0	a	its ♥♥♥♥ing Car soccer   pros: its soccer as a car   cons: gets borring and old real quick without friends.
9685	0	a	I love the game but till they fix controller support I cannot recomend it, its just not playable to the same degree with keyboard and mouse
9686	0	a	Hype is too huge. After 40 minutes I asked for refund.
9687	0	a	It's a good game when the servers aren't bad, &amp; it's impossible to hit the ball as you intended 80% of the time when the hitboxes seem to be bigger than the cars.
9688	0	a	Terrible. It was fun the first hour or so but then it became boring as hell. You just chase after a ball with zero teamwork. Honestly, your own team ruins more than it helps.  The MMR (if there is any) is horrible as well, since I've played multiple games where I'm in a full team of 'rookies' vs a full team of 'semi-pro's'.
9689	0	a	Great game, but i will be getting a refund since i cant even play because of your servers. i have great ping, and a great computer, game lags so much can not even play the game. It's like having a million dollars and not being able to even buy a coke.
9690	0	a	really hard......
9691	0	a	A completely amazing game that is RUINED by the lag that has plagued it since I bought it. I wanted to practice single player before jumping in the multiplayer so I didnt know how bad it was until it was past my time to refund it (2 hours).  I rubber band endlessly. at &lt; 20 ping.
9692	0	a	really there is a huge bug where if u even press forward my car goes flying doing whatever it wants. i cant lpay the game and always cause my team to lose. REFUND 
9693	0	a	Not the kind of game i like :l i am very dissapointed
9694	0	a	i love the game when my connection is good but there is no asia region servers for us to search and i really hope there is asia servers or i will not be able to play :(

9696	0	a	i want this game on mac
9697	0	a	- Terrible matchmaking that puts solo players up against premades all the time. - Ultimate trolling game and there is no report function. - As a result, there is a lot of toxic players and trolls in this game getting away with it. - Unstable servers can ruin ranked games. - Players queue up for ranked and leave instantly, so you have to 1v2 1v3, and you don't even get bots to replace them.  It's a fun game, but it will get on your nerves if you don't have a premade, because of awful decisions from the devs.
9698	0	a	This is a tough one to review, but made harder by Steams stupid rating system of Yes or No.  The game is superb, fun, beautiful and addictive.  The issue is that since launch the servers have been a nightmare, game breaking lag, downtime, turn off social features and more.  We've seen no progress on fixing it, just a post in the forum that claims they are fixing the issue but weeks later, nothing has improved.  The game is now festering on the installed games list, but now never played because of the unplayable lag.  You think your driving at the ball, then you go to hit the ball and you realised the ball is actually at the other end of the pitch. You turn you car right and it jumps 10 feet to the right and then fires you forward across the pitch, to only then fire you back to where you started.  Right now, don't waste your money, monitor the forums and wait for evidence that this games servers have been fixed.
9699	0	a	Best game ever !  Only if the game would stop crashing ! The game has a policy that if you quit while joining a ranked match, you get penalized for 15 minutes. During this delay you cannot join any ranked or not online game.   This seems perfect ! neh ? It doesn't cause if the game crashes while loading the game. It considers you as quitter. And therefore are banned for 15 minutes. I did contact and sent crash log to devs. Still awaiting answers. Great support !  Cheers !

9704	0	a	This game was the absolute ♥♥♥♥. I loved this game and played it competitively. But, this new update has ruined the game. Before the update I was playing with a ping of 8. Now, after the update I play with a wopping 268 ping. You can not play this game with a 268 ping and enjoy it.
9705	0	a	Mouse look is not functional.
9706	0	a	15 minute ban because I left a game with someone on our team trying to score on our goal in a ranked match......Needs work to penalize those that ACTUALLY NEED TO BE!!!!!
9707	0	a	The game is very laggy and I can't do much in this state...
9708	0	a	Servers still suck.  Resets of rankings and leaderboards.  I have the best ping in matches yet I still regularly get server lag and most often close to the ball in front of the net (ie the worst possible time to get lag).  No report function for teammates. Just played a game where a guy spun on his top the whole match. While I laughed a lot his teammate was angry.  In pub games, teammates regularly leave and are replaced by bots. You are regularly thrown into matches where it is halfway done and the score sucks.   In ranked games, if a teammate leaves, you're down a man. What fun when a 3v3 becomes 3v2. You can also start matches where not everyone loads and the game is then canceled (wait for match, load, wait for players, wait for loaders, nothing - what fun!).  No reporting, no muting, these are two really simple features for an online game so there is not a lot of variety or real polish. This game is worth maybe 5 bucks at most. Wait for it on sale. PS4 players get it free and that is a good deal because that is what it is really worth, NOTHING.
9709	0	a	Wtf did you do on the last update... I have an PC controler but after 5 mins it stops working and my mouse too, i have to restart the pc after i exit the game so i can use my PC...

9712	0	a	I would like my 20 Euros back.
9713	0	a	game is great fun however it is unplayable for me. The lag issues are ridiculous completely runing the game. I spend most of a match with my controller on my desk watching my car drive around utterly reandomly.
9714	0	a	If you're willing to buy this game, read this.  - The servers totally suck, spike and lag everytime, and sometimes they just get offline for no reason, 1 hour, 2 hour, 3 hours, we never know when its coming back. - The ranked system completely sucks, the 2x2 mode theres only people playing with friends, if you're going to play alone, you will get a huge disadvantage against people playing in party, the 3x3 and 1x1 are the only modes that you can get some fun without playing with people in party, but in my opinion, the 2x2 is the best way to play, and I just cant play it, because in 90% of the cases i get people in party on the other team, they created a standart 3x3, for 3 people play in party, but instead of creating a mode like in League of Legends where people in party will ever play with people in party, that doesn't happen, in standart 3x3 mode you cant get 3 people party against 3 random persons, which is pretty unfair. - Ranked system points: ♥♥♥♥, it sucks too much, when you win a match, you get something like 7~10 points (if someone quits, you get something like 1~5 points, yes, people usually quit when they're losting, the ban system is 15 minutes with 'find match' locked, thats basically nothing), when you lost you just get the same amount, you need to win a lot of matchs in a row if you want to climb up, what is not easy in 3x3 mode, the individual skill of the player doesn't matter too much. - The userbase; Jesus christ, the userbase of this game is something really bizarre, it's full of kids and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, flame, leaving and idiot people saying ♥♥♥♥ on the mic is something constant in this game, so if you're thinking you're going to play with mature or normal people, you're not getting this.  The pro of this game is that beside of all that I said, the game is cool, it's good to pass your time, but if you're willing to play ranked and climb up, you're going to face a hard road.
9715	0	a	I love this game, Upgraded to windows 10... DOESN'T RUN ANYMORE!!! 
9716	0	a	when the game first came out it was a great game but once they updated the physics it went south real quick wish you guys didnt mess with the physics or the game would have been one of the best games ever. went from a 9/10 to a 5/10 bc now the ball takes the worst bounces that shouldnt happen and then speed up and slow down in the worst weays possibles and you can just nip the ball oh so slightly and it will go halfway accross the map but then you hit it head on at full speed and it doesnt go anywhere like whats up with that? Now why does the ball go backwards even tho you hit the ball last or if the ball doesnt hit anyone else like tht screws a whole game up when its a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t bug that never happened before the first major update.... i give the game a 5/10 now since the release and just maybe it will get better after the horrible update that ruined this amazing game. so do i recomend this game? yes and no go back to the drawwing boards and fix everything you screwed up on and maybe ill come back and try it out after the next main update
9717	0	a	Do i recommend this game? Heck yea and no at the same time..... This is a Fun game,no doubting....but still people like me are banned from rocket league servers, seems psyonix made this game only for some specific countries,still it sells it to everyone, I've already mailed Psyonix 4 times and asked them to fix the issue and unban the iranian ips yet they didnt fix it,nor they didnt reply back to me. So do i recommend this game? For now,i don't cause this game is 'Rocket league of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ developers'

9722	0	a	The mechanics, the actual gameplay, is great. Really fun in fact.  But for me, the poorly thought out ranking system and lack of variety is what made me not enjoy it in the end.
9723	0	a	Will change to yes untill they fix the server de-sync issues. It's been in the game since the start and it's so god damn annoying.

9730	0	a	Bans you for 15 minutes if you lose connection for 10 seconds. Kills the game when your internet hiccups.
9731	0	a	FIFA 2550, Cars should stick to racing and leave the ball to f**king Leo Messi. The creators of this game were like F**k it lets make soccer and cars have sex and use a coathanger to bring it out. additionally this game came about from the make-a-wish foundation, thank you for birthing satan. The physics in this game makes a ♥♥♥♥ ton of sense, f**king double jumping cars and soccer balls brought from ISIS, then again. This game is discount FIFA. I wonder when bloody ultimate team is coming about.

9738	0	a	Meh, got boring really quickly.
9739	0	a	Well, the game is cool.  Pro's: It's fun. It's original.  Con's: Many kids (very annoying), many leavers (not fair), joining matches wich are already playing for 2 mins (because of leavers), no penalties for leaving (1 goal against and off they go). 
9740	0	a	Do i recommend this game? Heck yea and no at the same time.....

So do i recommend this game? For now,i don't cause this game is 'Rocket league of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ developers'
9741	0	a	Bad servers, several bugs, weird ranking system, you lose points when the server disconnects (nothing you can do about it). Game is 70% based on luck  Fun to play for half a hour a day, when you play longer than this amount you will start to become aggresive and break your shoe.  GG
9742	0	a	I need to play more time to be honest, there are a lot of nice things about this game but having problems to set up my controller and having to use x360ce or anything else to make it work is annoying for me and still not working as I would like. Note that my controller works very well on almost every game. Maybe I am wrong but I feel that a game like this were playing with a controller is so much fun, it should have better compatibility.
9743	0	a	Great game concept but ♥♥♥♥ING ♥♥♥♥♥♥ SERVERS. Every game i lag in ever sence there update i've had nothing but lag. (But w8 could just be your network....) NO it's not my network Every other game i get stable ping and stable connection. ROCKET LEAGUE SUCK ♥♥♥ FOR IT SERVESR.
9744	0	a	That sucks
9745	0	a	My rocket league won't load anymore when I click the play button. It's an amazingly fun game, and it's a shame it's broken in my steam account and there is no customer support
9746	0	a	Don't bother with this game. There's one mode, one type of arena and one power up. It gets boring and repetious after the first few games.
9747	0	a	The game is fun and everything, but definetly not worth $20...... I would not pay more than $5 for this game. It lacks many things like more game modes; you can only play online single matches (no tournaments, or seasons) and offline you can only play seasons using a difficulty out of 3 possible difficulties.  In 2 hours of gameplay I've unlocked 75% of all the unlockable content (cars, equipment etc.) and you can't customize your car to give it different stats, only looks.  Overall, I was a little dissappointed having spent $20....

9753	0	a	pushing a ball around with a tiny cartoony toy car wasn't as fun as I thought. I guess at 24 years old I am just getting to old for this ♥♥♥♥.   
9754	0	a	A game where you pick up were the losing team left off. Great game, awesome gameplay, awesome graphics... horrible mechanics. Gets really boring when you keep joining a game thats in progress with 1-5 score and 1 min left in the game. I want to love, I want to fandom it. Just the devs aren't thinking ahead. Make an option where can you join games in progress or not and this game might just save itself. I'm tired of losing every single game because ppl quit the current ones they are in.
9755	0	a	useless glitchy servers, allows players to use hacks, extremely poor physics meaning the ball goes through your vehicle or flies in a random direction, as well as servers randomly disconnecting you and then banning you for 15 minutes. great concept, embarrassingly poor execution.   only plus point: portal companion cube antenna.  
9756	0	a	How about you make it where the game doesn't end if the ball bounces ON THE ♥♥♥♥ING GOAL LINE. ♥♥♥♥ YOU, AND ♥♥♥♥ YOUR GAME.
9757	0	a	After the patch (that has been out for months) I haven't been able to play this game propely since in everymatch my ping is around 200. I play many other online games and there I usuallly have a ping between 40-60. I used to have it in this game as well.  The game itself is relly good but as long as it's unplayable (apart from bot matches), I cannot recommend this game to anyone.
9758	0	a	Fun game at first until you realize how broken the match making is.

9764	0	a	I wanted to like this game, but ultimately the severe connection issues caused me to get a refund. For a game whose major focus is online multiplayer, getting strange rubber-bandy lag every match was a dealbreaker for me. For what it's worth, it seems like there's a fun game here, albeit rather repetitive. I think this game is at its best when you have a group of friends to play with. I would wait for them to sort the connection issues out before jumping in, and even then I think $20 is a bit steep.  Also, the hockey mode is awesome! I actually liked it better than the regular mode - probably because the puck was much easier to hit. I hope they keep that mode in the game indefinitely.
9765	0	a	Games awesome but eventually it says 'cant log into rocket league server' wouldn't buy it until the devs fix this bug!
9766	0	a	Logged in one day and all my progress was lost because of 'corrup save files'? **** off I paid 20 dollars for a broken game?

9771	0	a	the game crashes as solon as i open the game!
9772	0	a	Psyonix has made a pretty solid game. The single player experience is pretty awesome. Unfortunately, as soon as you try to hop on to play online you'll experience relentless and unpredictable lag spikes. One match I'm playing like normal and the next I literally can't touch the ball because it warps 2 feet to my left as soon as I move in to hit. I'd just go back to single player, but once you wrap your head around the more advanced movement and such, the bots are more like obstacles instead of players.

9778	0	a	this is a game that commends luck and ignores skill at all but the top .5% of play hitting the ball ends up just being an rng determination and physics seem to be made up on the spot its completly inconsistent with how hits affect the ball the game should be good but every time i go reinstall the game to give it another shot im instantly reminded that unless i spent 3000 hours on the game my input into it means nothing!
9779	0	a	Can someone help me Im having trouble actually playing the game, i can boot it up propaly but Im not able to play the game in any way, not the tutorial or online games. I really want to play this game so can someone please answer my question.
9780	0	a	I am having major issues with connection to servers. It almost seems like every game I get into has lag and therefore is not very fun to play. However, I really enjoy the concept of the game and think that it certainly has potential. The major problem I have with the game is the fps and overall slow gameplay. C'mon rocket league, you can do better!
9781	0	a	Too slow
9782	0	a	One of the worst games on steam to date
9783	0	a	I heard all the hype about this game, and reading many positive reviews i purchased it, I am runing Windows 10 x64 with GTX 980Ti @4k res.  My xbox one game pad wont always work, the server reconnects is a hit and miss, game crashes oftern, just had the Aut 12 update 800mb almost.   also i get very hight ping around 100ms.  i very much hope it improves, what if rfind ironic is i am able to play batman arkham knight flawlessly
9784	0	a	This game is an awesome game and its actually realy fun. Playing with friends is probibly the best part . There is a HUGE learning curve that I still need to master. For the most part this game is fine, but... the matchmaking is the worst I have ever seen. When you reach rank 10 you become semi-pro, Pro 20, Veteran 30. I was so exited because i got out of rookie and into semi pro, so i decided i should go on to a ranked game. At first I didnt check to see what rank he was considering it was a ranked match, and guess what... A ♥♥♥♥ing Veteran, I am barley Semi-Pro.... going against... a Veteran. Come on really, I got onto a ranked match thinking that it would be RANKED but I guess not. I'm leaving this NOT RECOMENDED until this gets fixed because its a small thing that makes a big diffrence.
9785	0	a	Every other game in existance = Good Connection, can play online effectively. Rocket League = TERRIBLE CONNECTION, NIGH IMPOSSIBLE TO PLAY ONLINE 
9786	0	a	I love the game but i havent played it yet without constant ruberbaning and its literally just unplayable and its really a shame because i spent enough money on this for it to just not work i know it has potention i mean look at how possitive it is, but there is always one person who has a bad time or got unlucky which is unfortunatly me, but im really sad because i really wanted to experience what everyone else is soooooooo...  if u all could like this so it will be seen that would be very greatful because alot more people are having this experiance that i am then just me thanks.i would for sure love to like this once this gets fixed thank you!!!!!!!!!!
9787	0	a	DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!  I love this game, LOVE, but whoever is running the servers, does not care about it. You will get players with high ping that will just utterly ruins this game. 95% of the time, it will cause so much lag that you will not be able to line-up your car with the ball. The only way you can play this game, and not be frustrated, is if you're playing 1v1, which can be equally frustrating in it's own right.   It is absolutely impossible to play this game, unless the administrators get their acts together, because it is unbearable to play this game with high-pinging players. Even with players at 50 ping, on a 3v3, it can get choppy. Oh, and then you got foreign people playing on your side of the world, ruining every game in their midst. All of this can be solved if they just set their servers to auto-kick anyone with a ping of 100+, but they don't, for some brilliant reason.
9788	0	a	This game is one of the biggest pieces of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ I have ever played in the entirety of my life. I would rather kill myself than play it again, and I say that with 100 percent honesty.

9794	0	a	Was looking forward to play this game. I got to the start menu and it crashed repeatedly although my pc's specs are at the recomended level. I emailed Psyonix and got no reply so I am very unhappy with the game.
9795	0	a	At the end of the day, Rocket League is a cute take on soccer that, unfortunately, strips the sport of the finesse that makes it so great. This game is fun as a silly diversion, but whereas other 'e-sports' like DOTA make up for their lack of physicality with a depth and complexity not found in regular sports, what you see is what you get with Rocket League: cars driving - and sometimes flying - around, clumsily hitting a big ball.   Putting a fez on a car is pretty cool, though.
9796	0	a	Rocket League is the worst! major lag. toxic community and very bad servers i would give this a 2/10 NOT HAPPY!
9797	0	a	Do you like, irritating 9 year olds? Do you just adore matchmaking smurfs? Or maybe you just like command spamming? Sound Familiar? It's clearly not CSGO with less '♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥s'  Overall, if you don't have much time to play this game in your day, don't buy it. Only buy it if your are willing to throw your life away, and spend at least or close to 200 hours learning how to hit a ball in mid air in training before even thinking of playing matches
9798	0	a	good game but unfortantely i cant play it online , game developer blocked my country from entering their servers . i'm from iran and players here cant access to rocket league's server .  
9799	0	a	Let's play soccer with Hot Wheels, who the ♥♥♥♥ came up with this idea ?
9800	0	a	I love the idea of this game. I love this game. I hate the PC execution of this game.   The controls are terrible and unless someone is sending me $50 for a controller (which more than likely won't help me as I haven't been a console gamer since the SNES).  Oh, and 3rd person is a nightmare to line up the ball and car. Tried every combination of camara adjustment, played with ball and car cam, and I give the f*** up.  Deleted.
9801	0	a	Wonky controls, menu is unclear, casual matches are far too random to be remotely enjoyable, and the learning curve is pretty steep, making this very new player unfriendly.   Graphics are nice though. I'd give it about a 2/10 in terms of enjoyability however. I regret this purchase.
9802	0	a	I can't play multyplayer;(
9803	0	a	I joined a ranked game and it lost connection to the server and my game froze so I had to leave the game and I got a 13 minute ban. 13 minutes isn't long time for me to wait to play another ranked game. I could just play a regular game... right? NO!!! if you get a ranked ban you are banned from all game modes for the full ban time. Is that really necessary?! I got boned!  The matchmaking is a complete joke. It will throw you into a game that is half way done with on a team losing 0-11 (It's happened to me). It happens all the time. Why would I want to join a game that is half way through, let alone on a losing team.  The game itself is super fun to play and the controls are easy to learn.
9804	0	a	NO CROSS PLATFORM.......Only play random matches (solo) with PS4  Devs Lied its Partial Cross platform, u kno the part u dont care about. who cares of i can random match with a console.   Do not buy to play with Ps4 Friends....'It is coming soon' posted in june of 2015.   Gameplay 7.5/10 would be higher if community servers with custom modes. Networking 1/10 no True Cross Platform and Devs are borderline dishonest by not mentioning no Cross platform party suport.  Replayability 3/10 If you play for 30 min you have seen everything this game has to offer   Total 1/10 If i could get my money back I would 'dishonest/misleading' Devs and no updates to True Crossplatform will drop 'soon' enough

9808	0	a	Football with cars. And not the american football. Fun to play with friends on the weekends (if the MM in War Thunder is ♥♥♥♥ lol). But after that it can be a little boring and frustrating. New players will often get detroyed in their first 10-20ish matches, however playing in a group of friends is nice. If you're desperate to play an Esport this one works. No idea what they added in the recent patch, but unless there is a dramatic increase in content dropping ~20$ (US) doesn't feel worth it to me. But if you love soccer or RCs that much, you can buy it. (This review wasn't supposed to be negative. You can still have lots of fun in the game)
9809	0	a	No control of the ball whatsoever alongside the feeling of being power- and impactless during the match. just not enjoyable at all...idk why i bought this game, but it is just not worth it. 
9810	0	a	Not a great game. The concept is excellent, and the execution is awful. The graphics are incredibly overpowering for most if not any non gaming-designed computers, and the match making system butchers most of the potential for fun. The game certianly appears as though it would be fun after a solid 20 or 30 hours of figuring it out, but for that time you have to suffer through chat spamming and getting your ♥♥♥ kicked. If thats your kind of game, get this. But I certainly don't recommend Rocket League otherwise.
9811	0	a	
9812	0	a	Terrible game, if there is little to slight lag, you will miss the ball and end up giving the other team goals easily, gets extremely frustrating and ruins the overall experience quickly
9813	0	a	lukewarm 'No', it is a great game, but I just feel it is missing an intutitiveness to the controls (I am using a controller, people playing with keyboard might have a different opinion), great games I've played always seem to be second nature in the controls, like they are a natural extension to what you are thinking and the moves and feel to it just flow, Rocket League to me is not that, and a lot of the time your vehicle is missing the ball or shot and it is because the controls aren't putting your vehicle in the position your mind wants it to be.... I guess with hundreds of hours of play this might get better but it shouldn't have to be that way  so great concept and game, but to me the controls could be a lot better to make this one of the greatest, it falls very short of that, so if you get it, prepare to spend a lot of time learning the controls and being frustrated by missing easy plays and easy shots due to the car not doing what you want it to do
9814	0	a	it wont connect my controller 
9815	0	a	this game hasnt been launching since the hoops update and I've tried every single tutorial I could find to try and fix it, but nothing has been working if someone could help that would be great

9819	0	a	Fun game, but at the present time is has some major issues. Dont do it to yourself!  On the day of purchase I played for 4+ hours and was able to reach level 11. I had a blast, caught the bug, couldn't wait to play it again. I log in today, and all my hardwork is gone, my account has been wiped. I get the exteme pleasure of getting to start over. Your telling me I cant save any of my progress! I mean ♥♥♥♥ its not lick I lost content, just a bunch of paper doll crap its just mind bending to think I payed 20 bucks for this.  Match making is kind of weak at the moment. If I tell you I don't want to play in a EU server, I dont want to play in a EU server. Dont half ♥♥♥ match me up with a server where my MS is 313. Fiber wont even account for that amount of suck!  The most horrible thing about any game is when you spend money on it only to find out you are paying to beta test some one else's screw ups.   On top of it there seems to be no news/updates from any of the devs, but there making sure to pimp thier new dlc expansion.  Where is the 'Can I get my money back this game is a fraud' button?     
9820	0	a	This game can be fun; but also at the same time it can get fairly annoying. The ranked system needs work and it never pairs you with the right skill level.
9821	0	a	I bought the game but when I signed in to my libary a few days ago I saw I didn't have it and I would have to rebuy it? wtf?
9822	0	a	This game, technically is fairly good. They only problem I see is that the servers turn to absolute rubbsih at peak times during the week, you will most likely not be able to find a smooth game, Monday through Friday from about 3pm to 10pm. However, this game is not what you think it is. It is played off as being a competitive fun game, it is evertything but that. If you are playing with friends then you are good, but competitive might as well be a roll of a dice to decide if you win the game. My advice is either buy the game knowing that 50% is up to luck, either your side or the oponents, or play just with friends and not any compeitive game modes because they are truely a 100% waste of time. I cant stress enough why they should take the word 'competitive' out of the 'competitive playlist' because it is honestly just who ever can hit the ball second.
9823	0	a	i RAGE QUIT every time i play definently a no
9824	0	a	DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!! Online gameplay is IMPOSSIBLE due to constant lagging. This problem has been going on ever since the game was released with no improvement. I am highly disappointed. I feel like I have been cheated. It could be an AMAZING game if Psyonix actually cared about the quality of the gameplay and fixed the thing.
9825	0	a	i want my money back, i'm from iran and servers are banned for me,you little f**king thief publisher
9826	0	a	More interested in putting out DLC than fixing any of the AI, ranking issues, etc., its all about your money and they already have it.
9827	0	a	it does not support third party controllers thats not made in the xbox format. outherwise it's an caotic game with little to no control to it.
9828	0	a	its not working for me i want a refund 
9829	0	a	Wonky controls, menu is unclear, casual matches are far too random to be remotely enjoyable, and the learning curve is pretty steep, making this very new player unfriendly.   Graphics are nice though. I'd give it about a 2/10 in terms of enjoyability however. I regret this purchase.
9830	0	a	Matchmaking system has improved, but the game is missing really important basic features.  No mouselook. Players with controllers can look around, but mouse/keyboard players cannot. No camera collision (if you go up on a wall or near the goal, the camera will go behind the wall often obscuring you from seeing anything in the game) No Alt-F4  The game is otherwise pretty good, but it's hard to overlook these REALLY simple, obvious features that the game needs. Mouselook and camera collision (or at least transparent walls) have been in video games for at least 15 years, don't know why they can't do it.
9831	0	a	Trash
9832	0	a	Love the game BUT I am kind of disapointed with the amount of items in this game. I have 20 hours as of this review and I only have 6 wheels left to unlock, I unlocked all the cars about 12 hours in, I have all the paint variations. To get more you have to buy DLC F$$$IN DLC MAN, they use the idea of soccer and already thats a good game because sports are competitive and addicting but no one wants to play fifa, so cars, oh wait rocket cars, boom and it sells to gamers, now addicted to this idea of a game because competitiveness is addicting, So lets add items, but not to many so people get addicted to getting those aswell. HERES THE GAME CHANGER. WELL ADD DLC MAN! LETS ADD PAID CONTENT SO PEOPLE WASTE EVEN MORE MONEY! SO MUCH PROFIT BOYS!! thats a qoute from Gaben no i kid but honestly, paid content is so un honest, a large coorporation having there loyal customers give them more money then ♥♥♥♥ is worth. I SUCUMBD ALREADY I BOUGHT ♥♥♥♥ WHY!?!1? becuase its F$$KIN AWESOME MAN THE DELOREAN HELL YEAH ILL GET THAT but you cant even customize it... how aweful... I LOVE this game but please Gaben, Why DLC why do you want the moneys so bad, Dont you make enough off of the tax from market transactions? Why gaben why
9833	0	a	Good game but is unplayable online at peak times! Constant glitching and rubberbanding!
9834	0	a	Wow you can get banned now for just changing the files to play on certain maps on rocket league.  10/10 would play again  and now you can't play on the least laggy maps now yay R.I.P. FPS BOYS
9835	0	a	this game is cuck infested 
9836	0	a	This would be a great game if they could fix their servers. It's borderline unplayable at the moment due to the server lag.
9837	0	a	They removed the most fun game mode to play online (snow day, a hockey version of the game). You can still play private games, but it was way more fun to queue up against real players rather than have to invite friends and play against computers if you don't have enough for 2 teams. Will be spending A LOT less time playing this game because of that, which seemed very unnecessary for them to remove.
9838	0	a	Matched with 2 rookies in new season who both have less than an hour against guys with 100+.  Getting a down vote. Really ♥♥♥♥ poor ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ing match making.  
9839	0	a	Matchmaking will connect you to servers with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ping then ban you from joining other games if you choose to forfeit. Game 'physics' are a complete joke as well.
9840	0	a	Love the game lots of fun (BEFORE THE UPDATE) before the update me and my friends were getting fair opponents of equal skill semi pro on semi pro, now im 1v1 i am being matched with veterans in gold league and its just not fun anymore, i rarely win any now so its hard to level up, i do so much training watch loads of videos hoping that i will get better but everyone is just far too good for me i am semi pro against expert and veterans now im wondering whether i wasted my money or not. I dont want to spend hours training to be as good as everyone else i want some equal opponents not experts . i versed someone who played for 200 hours the other day and got smashed over 10 to 1. sorry but now i do not recemmend the game :,( fix these problems and i will reconsider.
9841	0	a	Their technicals problems = you getting banned. Plain and simple, the product is broken.  Their matchmaking servers will disconnect you (error 71), and while they provide no possibility of reconnnecting to a game they make sure to ban you if you disconnect. I am running on a hardlined 175+ Mb/s internet with no other connectivity issues. This has been reported on the forums by other players and it is a serious problem.  MAKE RECONNECTION POSSIBLE.
9842	0	a	not for mac 
9843	0	a	This is a pretty good sports/chill game. I am downvoting just because of simple mechanics flaw. If you were accerlating forward in to the view and LS up+jump, it will foward flip jump toward that direction. However, if you were accerlating the opposite direction where you'll have no view, out toward you from the screen (same, front bumper on foward), the LS up+jump will not foward flip jump to the direction vehicle is headed to. Instead, it will backflip. This really explanes a lot of things why I couldn't do certain things...  Also, the server disconntect often. If you were to leave because it won't connect back, either you can stay staring at the monitor forever, or leave and get 15 min penalty for something you have no fault for. Exiting the game and re-entering is prohibited for some reason; shi*ty.  Will maintain downvote until these are fixed.
9844	0	a	I received Rocket League as a free bonus for pre-ording steam hardware, and as a huge fan of fast-paced team based games I was looking forward to trying it out.  One of the first things that stood out as a huge positive for me was that you could not build your car to be better or faster, which means that if you want to get better at the game you have to improve your own skills. More games need to adopt this philosophy.  For the first couple hours it was fun, but after that it steadily got boring and annoying.   The boring part is the lack of overall strategy. After playing around 100 games, 90% of the goals were scored from either clearing the ball from one end of the field to the other, or just knocking it into the round corner and letting the borders do the work of centering the ball infront of the goal. Having the corners rounded benefits the attacking team so much that there is no need for an alternate strategy, so that's what everyone does... every game.... I truly believe that they need to have separate stadiums with square corners to promote other possible methods of attack.  The annoying part is the socc... I mean beach ball. Each match is 5 minutes long and it seems like the ball is floating in the air for about 4 and 1/2 of it. So you are left a choice of either using up your boost to reach higher and get an aerial hit or join the mosh pit of cars that are trying to reach it jumping from the ground.   If those things don't seem like that big of a deal to you, than your going to like this game. I however just kept losing interest the more I played it, mainly for those reasons.  Oh, and I forgot to mention the community. A team-based game should have a good community to back it up, however the community for this is terrible. One of the many reasons why is that there are A LOT of immature pre-teens mouthing off every chance they get. (At least the the game has an option to turn off voice communications).  Overall 5/10 (I personally would not recommend it for $20, maybe $10)
9845	0	a	I love the game but i havent played it yet without constant ruberbaning and its literally just unplayable and its really a shame because i spent enough money on this for it to just not work i know it has potention i mean look at how possitive it is, but there is always one person who has a bad time or got unlucky which is unfortunatly me, but im really sad because i really wanted to experience what everyone else is soooooooo...  if u all could like this so it will be seen that would be very greatful because alot more people are having this experiance that i am then just me thanks.i would for sure love to like this once this gets fixed thank you!!!!!!!!!!
9846	0	a	Get a controller. the default Keyboard controls are wonky  but if you can get through that you better live near one of the servers, cause if your ping is over 40 you're gonna travel through the ball, it's gonna wobble in physics defying ways around cars. Inconsistent garbage continues through every mode, even the casual fun modes  And if you can tolerate all of that then the community is absolute ♥♥♥♥ that doesn't care about sportsmanship, so forget competitive play being even remotely fun (which is the ultimate goal of a game)  Unless you're naturally talented at Rocket Flight AND Soccer, stay away
9847	0	a	Don't buy it, it will steal your life, your friends and your family. Let's not mention school...
9848	0	a	It is a good game, yes, but they keep adding new achievements so you will never really know if you can complete it at 100%, that is some bad bussiness
9849	0	a	I really want to recommend this game....  I just cant though, I get constantly bad teammates that just ruin the game, it doesnt matter if im playing ranked, unranked they're always terrible.
9850	0	a	I really like this game I really do but there's just one thing that just makes me never want to play this game and its the servers. This is the only game with servers with huge lag spikes. My ping is normally around everyone else's in game (roughly 30-40 ping) which is normal but on occassions my ping goes slightly high (anywhere from 50-75 or even a whopping 45 ping) and then my game has a stroke or a seizure of some kind and I get a massive lag spike and I can't tell whats going on cause everything and everyone is teleporting. I don't know why this and ONLY THIS game does this. I can play any other online game and I get no lag spikes but with this game it just lag spikes every 5-15 seconds and I can't play well when I go for the ball and magically phase through it. Until they can fix their servers from having a heart attack every time I jump a tiny bit in ping its just not fun and pretty much unplayable really.
9851	0	a	The key system is a money grab. It shows that Psyonix doesn't respect or care about the fans that have made this game good.   This isn't free-to-play. The players paid money for the game. They paid money for the DLC. This is how Psyonix thanks them?
9852	0	a	I can not recomment this game because of the broken matchmaking. Beginner versus rocketeer is totally unfair. The matchmaker is so balanced it would let you fight versus a mma fighter at your first day of elementary school. As long as they wont fix this I can not recommend this game.  The game looks good and has a nice music. You can customize your car but there is also a big downside.    Pro:   - Good graphics - Good gameplay - Nice music - Customizeable cars    Con:   - You need a controller to play this game. If you play with keyboard and mouse your movement will be limited - AFK players - Leavers run when the enemy scores a goal and leave you alone on the field - Salty flammers who insult you and screaming kids on voip - Premade groups dominate this game - Unfair and unbalanced matchmaking.  - Boxes like CS has. If you don't pay money they become useless.   The matchmaking is a big turnoff!  You either get rekt really hard or you beat your enemys so hard. The matchmaking in this game is really bad. There is barely any fair match. Always higher tranked players versus lower ranked palyers.  For example: - 3 Pro vs 3 Veteran - Rookie vs Expert - Pro vs Master - Pro vs Rocketeer.    Then ranking and titles:   0-9: Rookie  10-19: Semi-pro  20-29: Pro  30-39: Veteran  40-49: Expert  50-59: Master  60-73: Legend  74-75: Rocketeer  Im getting frustraded by the unfair matches and the insults of the other players. If you are looking for a fair matchmaking you are wrong here. This game is very unfriendly for new players. As a new player (rookie) you will have to play against way better players with the rank pro, veteran, expert or master who are experienced in this game. They know how to play this game and fly while you can barely hit the ball. They have spent a few hundred hours whiel you just started. Thats what they call a fair matchmiking in this game.  Sometimes your team members are really bad or go afk and you can do nothing about it. Have fun with your 3v3 when one of your teammate goes afk and the other just doesn't manage to hit the ball. Thanks to the great matchmaking you will see this happen a lot. Not only in your team. Sometimes the opponent leaves because you scored a goal and ruin the match for all other players.  You get insulted alot. The comon insults towards you, your mother and your family. Even the bad players who are less skilled and who can barely speak english insult you. They score an own goal and then insult you. It doesn't even make sense! Must be kids or ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ people. Here is an example:  https://youtu.be/ubgBdMLz2DI   This is what I mean. Full of kids screaming on voip chat:  https://youtu.be/hgCGXCY5aTE   The game is not bad but the unbalanced matchmaking and the toxic community may kill your fun really fast and keep getting you frustrated.   The publisher should work on the broken matchmaking and ban the kids of this game. If you insult someone or their family you should get banned. There isan option to report players but nothing happens when you use it. You could also call it a fake button for the upset people.
9853	0	a	Ive selected my region 'EU' Ive got 40-60 ping 120-150 fps stable but im still lagging, Let me give you an advice refund the game or dont buy it the servers are just getting worse and worse on PC if you want to play the game buy it for console as this game is impossible to be good at without and controller so you could just play on console instead, if you dont have a console then simply dont buy the game.
9854	0	a	The game itself is great but the players are annoying. They'll jump in to get credit for your goal and end up knocking the ball away and completely screw up the scoring opportunity. It's frustrating as hell and has made me leave matches.
9855	0	a	♥♥♥♥ game, ♥♥♥♥ physics, ♥♥♥♥ servers. 
9856	0	a	TLDR: Fun with friends, terrible if you're flying solo. I cannot recommend this game while the community is the way it is right now. I would recommend waiting a year until the console kiddies get bored, and stop playing.   This game is incredibly fun, but also extremely frustrating to play solo. The matchmaking is gawd aweful. Most of the time, it's not even a fair match.   The points system in the game is skewed. You can get TONS of points by sitting in the corner and knocking the ball back and forth to either rack up 'Center ball' or 'clear ball' points. People that do this will then say 'SEE? I did way better than you, because I have a ton of points with no shots on goal, or assists or saves.' If you are losing 6 to 1, and the game is obviously over, forget the 'forfeit' feature. nobody uses it, and you'll be stuck playing a losing game for another minute or so because you will be banned from matchmaking (punished for having a horrible team) for 15 minutes.   This game is INCREDIBLY fun if you're not solo queueing. But for solo queue it's VERY frustrating. In ranked, you'll get teamed up with people under your skill level against people who are at your skill level until your W/L hits around 50-51% where it tries to keep you at. So if you have a winning streak, expect horrid teammates to be on your team for a while. You either carry, or you lose.   Note: I have blocked more people on steam playing this game than any of my other multiplayer steam games... combined.  Update: Solo play still horrible. After latest patch, they reset everyone back to 0. So now no matter how you did last season, you're playing with brand new players, toxic trolls, and just overall people who really don't get this game, and will flame you for trying to give them advice (foreverprospect).  Status on downvote: ONLY playable with friends. I honestly don't know how they get such good ratings. They must have thousands of fake accounts on steam putting in good reviews.  Status on downvote 10/2016: nothing has changed. They make no effort to fix the issues with the matchmaking, and just put out more content for more money. I tried 2v2 solo to see if it was better. Expect to be teamed up with someone who has less than 200hours played, can't hit the ball, doesn't know how to rotate, or center against teams of 2. Complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. I don't know why I even bother.

9859	0	a	♥♥♥♥ this game.
9860	0	a	Fun game, but the servers are very bad. I run over 60 FPS and got under 30 ping. But yet the game laggs, rubberbanding and bad servers is somthing this game has to work on. But despite of this its a fun game.  - Update  The updates on this game has fu*ked up both the gameplay and the game.
9861	0	a	0 support for players with technical issues , no support option in game or anywhere else , no enfasis on teamwork for 2v2 or 3v3 so every ♥♥♥♥♥♥ will ruin your plays at the slightest chance of being able to hit the ball randomly , community is worse than LoL,no lagg issues being fixed, but we have cases and keys now so that makes up for it i guess
9862	0	a	Really unhappy with your server + lag guys. I chose the closest regions. See that I have like 50 ms, but still lagging a lot. Definatelly a NO. If possible I would like my money back. Screw this game.
9863	0	a	Played yesterday, was div 4 of all star, today i play and supposedly am 'unranked' play one game and get this magical 'promotion' to div 4 shooting star. Some would say motivation to do better, but with how it has been pairing me against people much higher ranked than me it is unplayable.
9864	0	a	My primary reason for disliking this game is that the matchmaking absolutely sucks. Experienced players are put with players with little experience. In my experience it is very common to be put into games already in play where you have no hope of winning because the opposing team has a huge lead over your team. I used to hang around so I could play the next game, but more often than not everyone would quit, leaving me stranded. If this was uncommon, I would be fine with it; however, it happens on a regular basis for me. For instance in the last session I played, I was placed in 4-5 unranked matches in a row where the opposite team had the lead, There needs to an option for unranked matches to join a new match (even if it means waiting a bit longer to play). I for one would be much happier with that than the current matchmaking system.  Also, the point system is not very consistent. For instance, if you assist in making a goal, the scorer only has 5 seconds to score for the goal to count. On the other hand if someone even attempts to make a goal, but fails, they will get rewarded with no regard (from what I can tell) for the time that passed between them hitting the ball and them (failing) to make the goal.
9865	0	a	Great fun game as you would expect from the videos you have no doubt seen, when its not lagging.  Has issues crashing to desktop that are well documented by thouand of players but seems to be no answer for other than reinstalling windows, llike that is what you do when one game crashes all the time but everything else on your system works. Often cars appear to be sunken into the floor.  XBOXONE cross-play update made matchmaking take much longer, I suggest you disable cross play.  Also disable voice communication unless you are playing with friends who are not screaming idiots. Expect rarequits.
9866	0	a	its ♥♥♥♥
9867	0	a	i want this game on mac
9868	0	a	Why the ♥♥♥♥ this game is free on PS4 but not on PC?
9869	0	a	Great game, but i will be getting a refund since i cant even play because of your servers. i have great ping, and a great computer, game lags so much can not even play the game. It's like having a million dollars and not being able to even buy a coke.
9870	0	a	This game induces so much rage it's aids
9871	0	a	Okay game, terrible community.
9872	0	a	the game crashes as solon as i open the game!
9873	0	a	Game works fine BUT there is no way to rejoin a game. In normal games this is no problem you just join new game. But in ranked, if u lagg out or disconnect for some reason then good luck. You will get timed out for 15 minutes and get penalties in your ranking. For competitive play this is a no go for me. 
9874	0	a	One of the requirements should be 'Have friends'
9875	0	a	This is a very fun game... WHEN IT WORKS. If you do not have the best computer I do not reccomend this game. When I try to play online or with my friends the lag makes the game in-playable. I have had the game for a month it is has caused more agravation the fun.
9876	0	a	Getting kicked for few seconds of idle is stupid, especially when its a premade match.
9877	0	a	i have randonly disconnecting in every game,plz help to fix
9878	0	a	I really want to enjoy this game, a lot of my friends play it. Unfortuately, the game is tedious, driving back and forth after a ball, feels like bashing my head against a wall. It was fun for the first few weeks, now it is repetitive.  Major changes need to take place to keep the game fun, I don't see that happening. For starters, 4v4 on this small of an arena is unplayable. Second, stacking defenders creates terrible stalemates. Rules need to be in place that limit the amount of defenders, same reason way soccer, hockey, basketball have rules for it.  Netcode is the worst I've seen, the ball teleports, changes directions, cars teleport and I have 100/100MB fiber connection.  In short, the game needs more game modes, some different rules, stable netcode, or else it will disappear soon.
9879	0	a	This game is loads of fun! Other than the constant desyncing they havent fixed since launch.....
9880	0	a	  ♥♥♥♥ on my pc.
9881	0	a	Do not get this game. i have a constent 50 ping but i lag so hard its unplayable. The servers suck. Explains why its only $20.
9882	0	a	10 games of solo ranked. 10 games of wasteland. 10 games of loses and deranking. GG MATCHMAKING. REMOVE WASTELAND PLS .
9883	0	a	Would be fun, but the servers are COMPLETELY ♥♥♥♥. The game has been unplayable for me for the last couple of weeks, if they can't fix this I can't enjoy the game and it'll have been a total waste of money.
9884	0	a	game is good, fun. connection issues make it unplayable and totally frustrating. wait till servers are fixed unless you like jumping randomly all over the map.
9885	0	a	This game used to be amazing, now the match making makes it laggy ♥♥♥♥ id have more luck having sexual intercourse with myself than finding a game with less ping that 100. ♥♥♥♥
9886	0	a	After playing this game for about 150 hours or so i thought i must do a review so here i am. I love this game so much it's addictive and fun a great ranking system and multiple modes which is why i have so many hours. However the reason i gave this game a bad review is the server connection. It's not good at all. I havn't got a bad computer or broadband and am blaming the connection because that is all fine for me. In the game the lowest ping i can get is 212 and that's when watching the replay of a goal the enemy scored. Because of this lag happening all the time in every game i cna't play because my car just teleports around the match arena so because of this i am afraid i am forced to give this game a thubmbs down!
9887	0	a	AKA Premade League. Gameplay is good Matchmaking is bad. You can'T avoid premades and premades will crush you %80 of the time. I don't want to matched with soloq people when i am premade with 2 other friends and we communicate really good, have a plan before hand etc. it sucks to play against premades too. Match soloq with soloq
9888	0	a	It is a grat game for sure but the community is awful. If you want to stay sane, stay away from this game.
9889	0	a	♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t game, i got cancer of it, ♥♥♥♥ing luckers play it, cars are not balanced, cant ♥♥♥♥ing land on ground, stay in midair like 5 seconds. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, not recomended! ♥♥♥♥ you all.
9890	0	a	too expensif
9891	0	a	It's an OK game not too good.
9892	0	a	Below you will read my initial review....  However I have cahnged my viewpoint from a positive to a negative... I would say 60-70% of games run like this.... Game eventually starts - 1 team scores, 1 member from other team leaves. That makes it 2v3.... It quickly turns to 1v3 and bam game is lost. The only punishment for quitting appears to be being unable to matchmake for 15 minutes....  For a game that thinks it is competition class.... it falls far short of this and you end up wasting more time trying to find a full game to completion than actually playing a good game.  3/10   [old review] sceptical at first, but the game has grown on me once I have fiddled with the various viewpoint options to take it away form looking like an oversized console game.  This is fun, frantic and with the dubstep music playing throughout will have you wanting more.  My only gripe with it is the match making which can take up to 5 minutes to get a game, plus in ranked more often than not there is a quitter, an also no boost from someone leaving, which can see you winning the game 3v3 to losing 2v3....  Overall, its demolition derby, mixed with football and rc cars.  8/10
9893	0	a	[ EDIT AT BOTTOM ]  Love this game. Everything about this game. But recently I have been getting the well known and still not fixed Error 71. So I am now unable to play this amazing game. Not sure why the developer refuses to address this issue.  Edit: I am not sure if enough people complained about the Error 71 or what but the game is once again playable. YAY! Now I only have two real complaints about this amazing game.First is that in the comunity playoffs ONLY team wins and losses count. All the games with random people, the games you win or lose count. Second is for all of the players out there that do more then hit the ball into the goal, like blocking, rebounding, passing, and defending, you get little to no points. Your actions don't really matter... other then your team has to win. Don't get me wrong, I still LOVE playing this game and will play it as long as I can. I just wish players were encouraged to do more then hit the ball in the goal.    [ EDIT - Nov. 16, 2016 ]  After an update or two this game has become pretty much unplayable for a chunk of the playerbase. Rubber banding and lag that do not appear in any other online game have killed this game. The publisher blamed most of this on a large playerbase but everyone started reporting the issues after an update not after a playerbase change. After many many players contacted the publisher aswell as posted about this on multiple forums, nothing has been done. Loved this game but would not suggest it to anyone right now.
9894	0	a	Worse community than G-mod and minecraft combined but if you don't speak Spanish you'll never understand it  also catastrophic lag 98% of the time on all servers making the game unplayable
9895	0	a	Fun game, but they added microtransactions, and crates at that. I have principles, so I'm not recommending this game, but it is fun.
9896	0	a	Hey everybody this game is a very very good excuse for killing so in your suicide letter you can just write 'Rocket Leauge' and then everybody will 100% understand what you have been through in life so buy this game for a good suicidal excuse;)  Recommend this game 100% (NO SARCASM)  
9897	0	a	The Connection To The servers are bad , my ping is always 200+
9898	0	a	Linux port fails to recognize my steam controller when my wireless keyboard is plugged in after 'press any button to continue'.  If i unplug my wireless keyboard+mouse dongle, steam controller works after pressing 'any button', but promptly crashes when entering a game.   With keyboard+mouse alone, it works as well as this game could work without a gamepad.  If you're a linux user who recieved a license to play this game along with the preorder of your steam controller and finally want to play it, keep wating.
9899	0	a	♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥ servers, only game I have 400 FKN MS in...............
9900	0	a	This game has gotten horribly toxic, you really don't want to play unless you know the people and/or are in unranked. I actually am out of words to describe it.
9901	0	a	Game is definitely in the right price range, but I guess I've played too much griball in the past to find this fun or engaging. If they add more game modes I'll take a look again, but as it is now just feels very repetitive.
9902	0	a	Connection issues, connection issues, connection issues   Every time I get into a game my ping is always in the yellow or red, and this is the only game that does this.  I've never had rubberband issues with a game quite like this. Fix your servers
9903	0	a	The game is fun enough, very simple but hard to master game that is insanely popular with a lot of folks to play with. unfortunately i cannot recommend this game due to the horrid servers whose goal is to give you a torrid time.  The ping can shoot up randomly fromm 60 to 700, and you will see teleporting everything, making it near impossible to play
9904	0	a	The Connection To The servers are bad , my ping is always 200+
9905	0	a	Very fun game with friends, im not a fan of sports and this is still an amazing game with good music and fun/rewarding gameplay 10/10 w/ friends 8/10 w/ randos.  Fast forward a few months and they added crates.....
9906	0	a	In my last review about rocket league, i posted 'Just buy it ok? BUY IT NOW', because the game was just perfect, the game is perfect, i have a lot of fun playing soccer with cars...simple isn't it? With almost 500 hours of gameplay, i can say: This game is awesome, you'll expend hours trying to get better and better, and screaming for ever aerial goal you did. So why a 'Negative review'? Because i live in South America, and here, the server are so bad, you can't find matches in days, stay in 'searching' for hours and hours, and can't play a single match before the day finish.  If you are in doubt, should i buy it or not? Just answer the question: 'Will you play in SA servers?' If not, go arread, you'll not regret it. But if you'll, and still want to play it, just for your knowledge, you'll be ♥♥♥♥♥♥ a lot of time with of the support do we have.
9907	0	a	Doest launch, and when it does it kicks me off randomly.
9908	0	a	Salty community
9909	0	a	Not that fun,when i bought it i was so excited but then when i played it for a few days i got bored of it. 
9910	0	a	This game, technically is fairly good. They only problem I see is that the servers turn to absolute rubbsih at peak times during the week, you will most likely not be able to find a smooth game, Monday through Friday from about 3pm to 10pm. However, this game is not what you think it is. It is played off as being a competitive fun game, it is evertything but that. If you are playing with friends then you are good, but competitive might as well be a roll of a dice to decide if you win the game. My advice is either buy the game knowing that 50% is up to luck, either your side or the oponents, or play just with friends and not any compeitive game modes because they are truely a 100% waste of time. I cant stress enough why they should take the word 'competitive' out of the 'competitive playlist' because it is honestly just who ever can hit the ball second.
9911	0	a	every one who loves cars or football can find this game interesting.  i said 'i will just try it' and after every match u want more, u need just one spin, one goal, JUST ONE. this game is f*cking adicitive  edit: they sholud put that DLC for free on PC. PS players should pay for it because they got game for free. thats not ok.   PC MASTER RACE

9913	0	a	shoot !!!  lol
9914	0	a	WTF I literally just got the game and am already experiencing EXTREME LAG! I can't even drive full speed!
9915	0	a	Can't get the game to run, when it finally loaded once, entire other team was invisible for ten seconds until the game froze. Couldn't get to task manager, had to hard-reset computer.  Still doesn't load. What. the. hell.
9916	0	a	Should be a free game to be honest worst money ever spent
9917	0	a	I HATE THIS SO MUCH LAG AND THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST COMPUTER I HATE YOU WAST OF MONEY 
9918	0	a	Fun enough if you have a full team of PCs, but the AI is complete garbage. On more than one occasion, I have seen them actually run the ball straight into their own goal. They also, quite often, knocked the ball away from the opposing goal. In addition, the game is not as in depth as i though it would be going in. I had hoped that the different cars would have different attributes, but all that changes between them is the hitbox. The devs have straight up said that, though. I wish I had waited for it to go on sale, and I should have done a bit more research before buying it; this just wasn't what I expected.
9919	0	a	We have a brand new computer and alright internet. I get like 15 fps on online and 20 when im not even online. I just wasted 20 bucks
9920	0	a	Great fun game as you would expect from the videos you have no doubt seen, when its not lagging.  Has issues crashing to desktop that are well documented by thouand of players but seems to be no answer for other than reinstalling windows, llike that is what you do when one game crashes all the time but everything else on your system works. Often cars appear to be sunken into the floor.  XBOXONE cross-play update made matchmaking take much longer, I suggest you disable cross play.  Also disable voice communication unless you are playing with friends who are not screaming idiots. Expect rarequits.
9921	0	a	We have a brand new computer and alright internet. I get like 15 fps on online and 20 when im not even online. I just wasted 20 bucks
9922	0	a	great game, very fun to play  EXTERMELY FRUSTRATING when every other match there is lag that makes the game unplayable  wait until Developers buys more servers...
9923	0	a	At first glance, it seems like a very fun game, however, the matchmaking is attrocious, often pitching higher ranked players vs lower ranks, and not spreading the different ranks evenly at ALL! The controls are basically impossible if you don't have a controller, and even with a controller, you're going to have lots of difficulty dealing with the BS physics in this game, eg. hitting the ball right on the centre, and watching it fly diagonally away from you. Usually when I do see people who are playing well, they are playing on a PS4. So if you own a PS4, consider buying this game, if not, don't waste your money and frustration on this 'game'.
9924	0	a	Servers are terrible
9925	0	a	This is a tough one to review, but made harder by Steams stupid rating system of Yes or No.  The game is superb, fun, beautiful and addictive.  The issue is that since launch the servers have been a nightmare, game breaking lag, downtime, turn off social features and more.  We've seen no progress on fixing it, just a post in the forum that claims they are fixing the issue but weeks later, nothing has improved.  The game is now festering on the installed games list, but now never played because of the unplayable lag.  You think your driving at the ball, then you go to hit the ball and you realised the ball is actually at the other end of the pitch. You turn you car right and it jumps 10 feet to the right and then fires you forward across the pitch, to only then fire you back to where you started.  Right now, don't waste your money, monitor the forums and wait for evidence that this games servers have been fixed.
9926	0	a	A fun little arcade game..and that's all it is.  No tactics; defensive play and teamplay is non existant, it's everybody vs everybody, there might as well just be one neutral goal, cause everybody want's to be the goal scorer. This is to be expected on pubs (public servers), arranged matches is a whole nother story. Momentum (car) is unrealistic. Don't expect AI to be anything but predictable, bad and pretty good at scoring own goals. One AI team always seem to dominate. Crap servers, which is the biggest con at the moment.  I would expect the server issues to be fixed sooner or later, which is the biggest problem for a lot of people right now.
9927	0	a	Enjoyable concept, but there is a lot of server lag and there are too many people in ranked matches that throw games with no meaningful way to have them reported. Yet, there are already making paid DLC.
9928	0	a	Apparently my 'License has expired' and i bought it with money so idk
9929	0	a	♥♥♥♥ this game
9930	0	a	dont buy this ♥♥♥♥ game all servers is laging all the time ! dont recomend to buy ....
9931	0	a	Absolutely love the concept of the game and the gameplay and physics are great, but I can't recommend this game in good conscience because from my experience the random latency and lag spikes make the game completely unplayable online.  I've spent hours trying every fix under the sun, including buying a new PC, a new router, new cables and switching ISPs. I've even moved countries and still get the same repeated lag spikes that lead to me missing the ball in key moments.  If you are going to buy it - immediately try going online and test your connection to the game servers out - if you get any kind of lag spike despite low latency then immediately refund the game.
9932	0	a	My computer cant handle it
9933	0	a	was a awesome game untill they but wastelands into competitive
9934	0	a	I can't suicide bomb here. Definitely not a 9/11 review more like a 7/11.
9935	0	a	Alright game. Can't Alt F4 out of it... that's a problem.
9936	0	a	BY FAR THE WORST ♥♥♥♥ING GAME I EVER BOUGHT
9937	0	a	the new updates isnt very good e.g the hoop map the hoops are to big you need to make then smaller and map the maps bit harder thank you
9938	0	a	Fun, but gets stail quick, and pumping out dlc, without any real content additions like new game modes or anything really have proven to me the devs are only in this for a quick money grab. More custimization options outside DLC cars is needed, the game is fun, but the way they are pumping out dlc without addition of real content left a bad taste in my mouth.
9939	0	a	Played it on the free weekend, glad I did so I'd know not to buy it. Fun for a day or so and that's about it. Matches were both too short and too easily ended up as a slaughter, I'm guessing cause of the small team sizes.
9940	0	a	♥♥♥♥ing gay, i hate ni ggers, jews, ♥♥♥♥♥, and arabs too. hitler did nothing wrong and this game is garbage and i kill f aggots and kill n iggers with a glock on the daily
9941	0	a	Don't bother with this game. There's one mode, one type of arena and one power up. It gets boring and repetious after the first few games.
9942	0	a	awesome (even its laggy) im waiting for this game:D EDIT:i change my mind first i like the game even its laggy now i hate i always lose becuz of the pro players:( plz make the game like ranked match or unranked m8 thumps down for now&gt;:D
9943	0	a	After the patch (that has been out for months) I haven't been able to play this game propely since in everymatch my ping is around 200. I play many other online games and there I usuallly have a ping between 40-60. I used to have it in this game as well.  The game itself is relly good but as long as it's unplayable (apart from bot matches), I cannot recommend this game to anyone.
9944	0	a	How to ruin game: Step 1: Make super cool, awesome game. Ex: Rocket League Step 2: Add microtransactions where you have to spend hundreds of dollars to get all customization options. Ex: Rocket Leauge
9945	0	a	this game is cuck infested 
9946	0	a	I wanted to enjoy this game soo much but the horrible camera control ruins the experience completely. 7/10 for gameplay but 1/10 for controls and camera.  ONLY PLAY THIS IF YOU HAVE A CONTROLLER IF NOT SKIP THIS EXERCISE IN FRUSTRATION  5/7 PERFECT SCORE
9947	0	a	I cant play it its to laggy 
9948	0	a	Every time I open Rocket League it thinks its the 'First Time' and tried to install some MSIexe ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t... Please fix this.  8/01/15 - Game has been updated. I joined a game. My partner sucked ♥♥♥ and told me I was a noob after i scored all the goals... So I decided to stop and sit....After 60 seconds I was booted from the match, bc I was 'idle' and then BANNED from playing for 15 mins.........................................  WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥ KIND OF ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T IS THAT?!?!?! YOU HAVE NO ♥♥♥♥ING RIGHT TO BAN ME FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME!!!!!! Review will now be NEGATIVE.  ♥♥♥♥ YOU ROCKET LEAGUE  8/02/15 - Earned the Octane Skulls Decal TWICE now and still dont have it available for use.....
9949	0	a	OMG THE AI IS ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. YOUR OWN TEAMMATES WILL SCORE 9 TIMES OUT OF 10 FOR THE OTHER TEAM
9950	0	a	The game is very fun but the camera movement and control is abysmal. You can only look either straight ahead or at the ball and this can cause issues such as getting you stuck on walls or inside goals or getting lost when the ball flies high in the air. If they added a camera mode where you could move it around with your mouse, it would be the perfect game, but right now it is quite confusing to move around.
9951	0	a	the new updates isnt very good e.g the hoop map the hoops are to big you need to make then smaller and map the maps bit harder thank you
9952	0	a	The game is fun and everything, but definetly not worth $20...... I would not pay more than $5 for this game. It lacks many things like more game modes; you can only play online single matches (no tournaments, or seasons) and offline you can only play seasons using a difficulty out of 3 possible difficulties.  In 2 hours of gameplay I've unlocked 75% of all the unlockable content (cars, equipment etc.) and you can't customize your car to give it different stats, only looks.  Overall, I was a little dissappointed having spent $20....
9953	0	a	Still can't connect to online servers after a month of having the game :/
9954	0	a	horrible
9955	0	a	I thought this was gonna be my type of game, and I couldn't be more wrong. The controls are somewhat complex for my liking, and it just feels sort of clunky. The ball feels like it has helium in it, it takes AGES for it to come back down to the field. The gameplay is simply repetitive. It's a soccer game so that is to be expected. The game is just simply not my cup of tea. If you like sports games, totally get it,  but I do not like sports games. I'd rate it a 6/10, as it was somewhat fun, but got old within an hour or so. I logged about 70-some minutes in the game and requested a refund.

9962	0	a	NO CROSS PLATFORM.......Only play random matches (solo) with PS4  Devs Lied its Partial Cross platform, u kno the part u dont care about. who cares of i can random match with a console.   Do not buy to play with Ps4 Friends....'It is coming soon' posted in june of 2015.   Gameplay 7.5/10 would be higher if community servers with custom modes. Networking 1/10 no True Cross Platform and Devs are borderline dishonest by not mentioning no Cross platform party suport.  Replayability 3/10 If you play for 30 min you have seen everything this game has to offer   Total 1/10 If i could get my money back I would 'dishonest/misleading' Devs and no updates to True Crossplatform will drop 'soon' enough 
9963	0	a	I really enjoy this game when I have the chance to play with friends, but aside from that, I wouldn't touch it, people just cannot comprehend team work.
9964	0	a	why are the servers always down after 12pm? 
9965	0	a	The game is not bad. The matchmaking system is horible. If you dont play with friends be prepared for the worst games online. Just like any other online game , full of ragers, flamers. Just makes me sick. You could just take out the communication of the game.
9966	0	a	One of the worst games I have ever played. It lags every game, I have no idea what to do and it runs as slow as it possibly can. I'm sorry for the negative review, but it really is no woth $20.
9967	0	a	This game is laggy as ♥♥♥♥
9968	0	a	I really want to recommend this game....  I just cant though, I get constantly bad teammates that just ruin the game, it doesnt matter if im playing ranked, unranked they're always terrible.
9969	0	a	Wow you can get banned now for just changing the files to play on certain maps on rocket league.  10/10 would play again  and now you can't play on the least laggy maps now yay R.I.P. FPS BOYS
9970	0	a	Ok Im soo sad to see NO ASIAN SERVERS IN ROCKET LEAGUE that why i request a refund
9971	0	a	I can not play with a steam controller and another Joystick same time.

9973	0	a	this game is a joke. they think its acceptable the release paied dlc before fixing the game. dont bother buying unlesh you want to lag all of the time and have party issues.

9975	0	a	Servers are sh*t. Fix it. Period.
9976	0	a	This is the most repetitve game that I have seen in a long time. Should be free or cost 5 euro. Every match is literally the same, I mean c'mon. Not worth the money.
9977	0	a	it very laggy and wont let me play because it tells me to close the progam

9979	0	a	Game is amazing, but EXTREME server issues make the game unplayable.
9980	0	a	good game but unfortantely i cant play it online , game developer blocked my country from entering their servers . i'm from iran and players here cant access to rocket league's server .  
9981	0	a	Games awesome but eventually it says 'cant log into rocket league server' wouldn't buy it until the devs fix this bug!
9982	0	a	Logged in one day and all my progress was lost because of 'corrup save files'? **** off I paid 20 dollars for a broken game?
9983	0	a	This game is enjoyable with friends. However, it is a pretty good rage simulator too.  Good:  -Fun concept for a game, RC cars playing soccer/futbol. -Fun times with friends. -Rewarding to play full matches even when losing. -Good customization of your car. -Excellent visuals. -Good price. -Replays after each goal. -1V1, 2V2, 3V3. and 4V4 modes which are nice for controlling how chaotic you want your matches to be. -Ability to mute text and voice chats, good for when you don't wanna deal with a**holes.  Bad:  -Matchmaking likes to pair you with higher/lower levels compared to yours very often. -Physics, seems a bit odd at times. -The way the ball soars high, you will get annoyed at the number of times you barely miss hitting it. -Will cause rage and a lot of 'HOW?!' outbursts. -Driving up the walls, not a feature that I care much for. -Controller support is weird, since it likes to invert my thumbsticks and buttons around. -Cameras and keeping an eye on the ball is a pain. -Nitrous system should slowly recharge as the default instead of battling for pickups.  So why don't I recommend it? Mainly because I have mixed feelings about it. When I first started playing, I was enjoying it. Playing with people of my level and scoring constantly. But after a while, I was still a Rookie rank, and started against Pro and Veteran players. After that, I slowly lost interest. I still like the game, so long as a friend plays it with me so we can share the rage together. All good things must come to an end.
9984	0	a	paid $23 for this game: No South African server $0 for Dota 2: South African ♥♥♥♥ing server  Problem?!
9985	0	a	Don't whast you'r money on this pice of **** game, no matter what yoiu do EVERYONE you play against is super lucky and everyone you play with is just pure ****! f this game!
9986	0	a	Pro side:  + Incredibly addictive and fun for a while. + High skill cap.   Con Side:  - Fun only for a short while, because the gameplay is actually incredibly shallow as well. - No support for anything it seems, except keyboard and XBOX controller. I can't get any of my Logitech or Thrust devices to work and I am not alone. There are mapping tools out there that have been suggested but also only work for a few of us. - No friggin proper camera! No kidding, this game has no proper camera! While mouse free-look is standard in just about every single 3rd person view game on PC, the developers of this game decided to skip this basic feature and just make it random whether you see anything or not. There are rumors it was to prevent advantages of PC players over console players, since the game is cross-platform. You can lock your camera on the ball, getting your camera blocked by walls or losing sight of the goal, other players or your own car while the camera is zoomed in on the ball in mid-air or while driving along walls, or you can lock the camera on your car, losing sight of everything but your car again. Of course, there is the camera swivel feature, which is about as useful as the other camera features. You can't control the swivel degree, you simply throw your head around in one direction and try to identify whatever just whizzed by on your screen because even if you stopped the swivel from going almost all the way to the rear, it snapped back to the front view instantly. If you want to keep your eye on something to your side for longer than a split-second, you need to twitch the camera into that direction, giving you some kind of epileptic vision, which coincidentally is exactly the same effect you get when you try to use the swivel with your mouse movements. - People quit nonstop. Whether it is connection-related or intentional quitting, you often feel like playing with, and against, a line of players. Every 20 seconds its 'next please!'. - No proper chat support. Right, only people on the PC version can write in/read the chat. The people playing on consoles are restricted to chat commands, and unfortunately they seem to enjoy it a lot. Probably an incredibly high-tech feature on consoles, they love it SO much that many console players will spam the hell out of the chat commands. Together with the beep that comes with the command, it gets annoying and is unblock-able. You are only able to block people in voice chat. - Lack of customization. Cars all have the same stats, according to the developers' official statements, but slightly different hit-boxes. If I could tinker with my car, tuning it with more than just a handful of visuals (and hats! wtf!), the fun would last a lot longer.   Verdict: Fun game but shallow and lacking the most basic features of ANY game, namely: Proper camera, proper chat, proper peripheral support. Not worth 20 bucks IMHO, unless maybe you are a console player and got used to all the ridiculously low-tech features anyway.

9988	0	a	Fun game, but at the present time is has some major issues. Dont do it to yourself!  On the day of purchase I played for 4+ hours and was able to reach level 11. I had a blast, caught the bug, couldn't wait to play it again. I log in today, and all my hardwork is gone, my account has been wiped. I get the exteme pleasure of getting to start over. Your telling me I cant save any of my progress! I mean ♥♥♥♥ its not lick I lost content, just a bunch of paper doll crap its just mind bending to think I payed 20 bucks for this.  Match making is kind of weak at the moment. If I tell you I don't want to play in a EU server, I dont want to play in a EU server. Dont half ♥♥♥ match me up with a server where my MS is 313. Fiber wont even account for that amount of suck!  The most horrible thing about any game is when you spend money on it only to find out you are paying to beta test some one else's screw ups.   On top of it there seems to be no news/updates from any of the devs, but there making sure to pimp thier new dlc expansion.  Where is the 'Can I get my money back this game is a fraud' button?     
9989	0	a	Do you like playing solo and want proper matchmaking? Steer far away from this title, matchmaking constantly places you to lost matches or solo against teams of 3.  Ranked is a joke as both team queue and solo queue are on same queue and penalties for leaving are minimal. (15 minutes before you can rejoin and no ranking loss)  Until they fix matchmaking issues I cannot recommend this game for solo players.
9990	0	a	This game ♥♥♥♥ing sucks ever since the update. Do not buy this game. Would not recommend to my worst enemy.
9991	0	a	This game is TERRIBLE the only way to score a goal when you start is for everyone to leave the ball and let you score. And still you can miss. Most of the time you are being bashed around, or missing the ball every time you try to hit it. And most of the time there are people with aimbot on. AND even the 'easy' bots are hard.
9992	0	a	Be Warned: It tells you that you should use a controller for the game, but only allows Player 2 in split screen mode to use one. Player 1 cannot use a game controller.

9993	0	a	crashes too much and everything i have is up to date with tons of space. tried playing it in diferent resolutions doesn't work. I really wanted to play this game and i have tried everything for hours on end. the game says i've been playing for an hour and 30 mins, but thats how long it took me to attempt everything to play smoothly. It looks like an amazing game though, but sadly it won't start.
9994	0	a	if you played before the latest update IT DELETES EVERYTHING exept replays
9995	0	a	AKA Premade League. Gameplay is good Matchmaking is bad. You can'T avoid premades and premades will crush you %80 of the time. I don't want to matched with soloq people when i am premade with 2 other friends and we communicate really good, have a plan before hand etc. it sucks to play against premades too. Match soloq with soloq
9996	0	a	Meh, got boring really quickly.
9997	0	a	the reason I dont recommend this game is cause of multiplayer.The servers on this game have a great shot of winning a guinnes world record for worst servers in the history of worst servers.Literally EA servers are better than this crap.Also i was in a game where we all had green ping and yet the game was still atrociously laggy.
9998	0	a	Best football game ever.  Worst servers, prio on ps4....
9999	0	a	ruined my life
